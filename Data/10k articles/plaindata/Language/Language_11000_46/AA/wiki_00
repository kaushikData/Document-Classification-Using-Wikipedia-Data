The air interface involves both the physical and data link layers (layer 1 and 2) of the OSI model for a connection.\n\nThe physical connection of an air interface is generally radio-based. This is usually a point to point link between an active base station and a mobile station. Technologies like Opportunity Driven Multiple Access (ODMA) may have flexibility regarding which devices serve in which roles. Some types of wireless connections possess the ability to broadcast or multicast.\n\nMultiple links can be created in limited spectrum through FDMA, TDMA, or SDMA. Some advanced forms of transmission multiplexing combine frequency and time division approaches like OFDM or CDMA.\nIn cellular telephone communications, the air interface is the radio-frequency portion of the circuit between the cellular phone set or wireless modem (usually portable or mobile) and the active base station. As a subscriber moves from one cell to another in the system, the active base station changes periodically. Each changeover is known as a handoff.Inverted F antenna use as mobile phone interface medium. In radio and electronics, an antenna (plural antennae or antennas), or aerial, is an electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa.[1] It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves).\nAn antenna focuses the radio waves in a certain direction. Usually, this is called the main direction. Because of that, in other directions less energy wil be emitted. The gain of an antenna, in a given direction, is usually referenced to an (hypothetical) isotropic antenna, which emits the radiation evenly strong in all directions. The antenna gain is the power in the strongest direction divided by the power that would be transmitted by an isotropic antenna emitting the same total power. In this case the antenna gain (Gi) is often specified in dBi, or decibels over isotropic. \nOther reference antennas are also used, especially: •gain relative to a half-wave dipole (Gd), when the reference antenna is a half-wave dipole antenna;\n•gain relative to a short vertical antenna (Gv), when the reference antenna is a linear conductor, much shorter than one quarter of the wavelength.\n\nThe data link layer in an air interface is often divided farther than the simple Media access control (MAC) and Logical link control (LLC) sublayers found in other OSI terminology. While the MAC sublayer is generally unmodified, the LLC sublayer is subdivided into two or more additional sublayers depending on the standard. Common sublayers include; \nEspecially in mobile telecommunication and internet broadband Maximal combined input ratio with respect to signal to noise ratio estimation\n1.The signals from each channel are added together\n\n2.The gain of each channel is made proportional to the rms signal level and inversely proportional to the mean square noise level in that channel.\n\n3.Different proportionality constants are used for each channel.\n\nsmart matrix array for combine input signal gain separated them with filters and different types of output multiplexed schemes are used for approach to multiple users for example CDMA, FDMA, WCDMA, TDMA, ODMA etc.Such way calls and network services are approach and authenticate to unique subscriber.\n\ncore network link protocols\n\n"}

The term is from French \"étiquette\" \"label, sticker\" (cognate to \"stick\"), from which also comes the English word etiquette \"rules of behavior\".\n\nBecause the etiquettes are just instructions to postal clerks, and have no monetary value, their printing and distribution need not be as carefully controlled as for postage stamps, and most are privately produced. The usual design is a plain blue oblong, with the phrases \"AIR MAIL\" and/or \"PAR AVION\" in white letters. Airlines and hotels have also produced etiquettes, some quite attractive.\n\nThe airmail etiquette may be omitted if airmail stamps are used on the letter, and in some cases even this is not necessary if a country sends out all its foreign mail by air.

Originally, Bohtan Neo-Aramaic was spoken on the Plain of Bohtan in Şırnak Province of southeastern Turkey as well in the town of Gardabani, near Rustavi in Georgia, Göygöl and Ağstafa in Azerbaijan. However it is now spoken in Moscow, Krymsk and Novopavlosk, Russia. It is considered to be a dialect of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic since it is a northeastern Aramaic language and its speakers are ethnically Assyrians.\n\nBefore World War I, there were around 30,000 speakers of Bohtan Neo-Aramaic on the Plain of Bohtan, around the town of Cizre in Turkey's Sirnak Province. Mostly members of the Assyrian Church of the East, their language was a northern dialect of the more common Assyrian languages, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, but already somewhat more conservative than the standard Alqosh dialect. With the Assyrian Genocide that hit the Assyrians in eastern Turkey at the end of the war, many were forced from their homes.\n\nA decimated population travelled from Bohtan and eventually resettled in Garbadani in southeastern Georgia, 530 km from their original home. Many of the speakers of Bohtan Neo-Aramaic are over sixty year of age. The younger generations tend to use Georgian or Russian instead. According to recent studies, these communities have moved to Southern Russia, in the towns of Krymsk and Novopavlosk\n\nThis dialect is derived from the Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) languages, which is made up by Bohtan Neo-Aramaic, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldian Neo-Aramaic, Hertevin, Senaya and Koy Sanjat Surat. Bohtan refers to the area between the Tigris and Bohtan river . The dialect mostly spoken by Christian communities.\n\nThe Neo-Aramaic language is classified under Afroasiatic and the Bohtan dialect is more specifically one of the NENA dialects which are found south-eastern Turkey, northern Iraq and western Iran Due to the dislocation of NENA speakers, neighboring languages have influenced the dialects, such as Kurdish.\n\nOne of the latest studies of the language was carried out by Samuel Ethan Fox in 1999, showing that Bohtan Neo-Aramaic has retained many conservative features of Chaldean and Assyrian Neo-Aramaic which are not present in the standard Alqosh and Urmia dialects, but has also developed new features that are not present in other dialects.\n\nBohtan Neo-Aramaic is considered as a severely endangered language, mostly found in Belgium, France and the former Soviet Union. Due to migration and intermarriage, younger generations speak the language less fluently.\n\nIn Belgium, Mechelen there over 10,000 Assyro-Chaldeans who speak the Bohtan Neo-Aramaic.Which they pass on to their children.\nAlso in France, there over 35,000 Assyro-Chaldeans who speak Bohtan Neo-Aramaic.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "62119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62119", "title": "Bradford's law", "text": "Bradford's law\n\nBradford's law is a pattern first described by Samuel C. Bradford in 1934 that estimates the exponentially diminishing returns of searching for references in science journals. One formulation is that if journals in a field are sorted by number of articles into three groups, each with about one-third of all articles, then the number of journals in each group will be proportional to 1:n:n². There are a number of related formulations of the principle.\n\nIn many disciplines this pattern is called a Pareto distribution. As a practical example, suppose that a researcher has five core scientific journals for his or her subject. Suppose that in a month there are 12 articles of interest in those journals. Suppose further that in order to find another dozen articles of interest, the researcher would have to go to an additional 10 journals. Then that researcher's Bradford multiplier \"b\" is 2 (i.e. 10/5). For each new dozen articles, that researcher will need to look in \"b\" times as many journals. After looking in 5, 10, 20, 40, etc. journals, most researchers quickly realize that there is little point in looking further.\n\nDifferent researchers have different numbers of core journals, and different Bradford multipliers. But the pattern holds quite well across many subjects, and may well be a general pattern for human interactions in social systems. Like Zipf's law, to which it is related, we do not have a good explanation for why it works, but knowing that it does is very useful for librarians. What it means is that for each specialty it is sufficient to identify the \"core publications\" for that field and only stock those; very rarely will researchers need to go outside that set.\n\nHowever its impact has been far greater than that. Armed with this idea and inspired by Vannevar Bush's famous article \"As We May Think\", Eugene Garfield at the Institute for Scientific Information in the 1960s developed a comprehensive index of how scientific thinking propagates. His Science Citation Index (SCI) had the effect of making it easy to identify exactly which scientists did science that had an impact, and which journals that science appeared in. It also caused the discovery, which some did not expect, that a few journals, such as \"Nature\" and \"Science\", were core for all of hard science. The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences.\n\nThe result of this is pressure on scientists to publish in the best journals, and pressure on universities to ensure access to that core set of journals. On the other hand, the set of \"core journals\" may vary more or less strongly with the individual researchers, and even more strongly along schools-of-thought divides. There is also a danger of over-representing majority views if journals are selected in this fashion.\n\nBradford's law is also known as Bradford's law of scattering and as the Bradford distribution. This law or distribution in bibliometrics can be applied to the World Wide Web.\n\nHjørland and Nicolaisen (2005, p. 103) identified three kinds of scattering:\n\nThey found that the literature of Bradford's law (including Bradford's own papers) is unclear in relation to which kind of scattering is actually being measured.\n\nThe interpretation of Bradford's law in terms of a geometric progression was suggested by V. Yatsko who introduced an additional constant and demonstrated that Bradford distribution can be applied to a variety of objects, not only to distribution of articles or citations across journals. V. Yatsko's interpretation (Y-interpretation) can be effectively used to compute threshold values in case it is necessary to distinguish subsets within a set of objects (e.g. successful/unsuccessful applicants, developed/underdeveloped regions, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18837359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18837359", "title": "Cebuano grammar", "text": "Cebuano grammar\n\nCebuano grammar encompasses the rules that defines the Cebuano language, a Visayan language spoken in Cebu, Bohol, part of Leyte island, and the majority of Mindanao. \n\nCebuano has eight basic parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, particles, prepositions and conjunctions. Cebuano is partially inflected: pronouns are inflected by number, and verbs are inflected for aspect, focus, and mood.\n\nCebuano, along with many other Philippine languages, are sometimes considered ergative or nominative in alignment, both being incorrect and correct as it has features of both systems. See Austronesian alignment.\n\nCebuano verbs are morphologically complex and take on a variety of affixes reflecting \"Voice\", \"Quality\", \"Aspect\", \"Mood\", and others. Cebuano arguably follows Austronesian alignment. Basically, verbs conjugate by using these affixes according to which argumentative role the noun in the direct case has. This noun in the direct case can be the doer of the action, the recipient of the action, the purpose for the action, or the means by which the action was made possible; which are all argumentative roles. The direct case hides the noun's otherwise-evident argumentative role, which the verb then makes up for by conjugating with specific affixes that indicate which argumentative role the noun in the direct case has. Some Cebuano grammar teachers call the noun in the direct case the \"Topic\" of the sentence, but some others call it the \"Focus, Voice,\" or \"Trigger\"; as the verb and the other nouns in the sentence have all their noun markers and affixes change accordingly. \n\nCebuano has four voices: the Active Voice a.k.a. \"the Agent Trigger\", the Passive Voice for Direct Objects a.k.a. \"the Patient Trigger\", the Passive Voice for Indirect Objects and/or Locations a.k.a. \"the\" \"Circumstantial Trigger\", and the Passive Voice for Instruments a.k.a. \"the Instrument Trigger\".\n\nThe Circumstantial Trigger Affixes select for location, benefactee and/or goal topics.\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks the topic in Cebuano, is \"ang\" or \"si\".\nHere, the agent Maria is marked with si, the personal direct noun marker. The prefix Mo- indicates that the noun in the direct case (Maria) is also the agent, which would not have been known otherwise.\n\nHere, the patient Bugas is marked with ang, the general direct noun marker. The suffix -on indicates that the noun in the direct case (bugas) is also the patient, which would not have been known otherwise. Babaye is marked with sa, the general ergative noun marker which indicates that babaye is not in the direct case but is still the agent of the sentence. Via context and common word order, it is evident that lata is not the agent despite it being marked with sa as well (but as the general oblique definite noun marker), because it is not the first noun in the sentence (which the agent usually is) and nor can a can cook rice (context).\n\nHere, the location lata is marked with ang, the general direct noun marker. The suffix -an indicates that the noun in the direct case (lata) is also the location of the action, which would not have been known otherwise. Babaye is marked with sa, the general ergative noun marker which indicates that babaye is not in the direct case but is still the agent of the sentence. Bugas is marked with the general oblique indefinite marker og, indicating that it is neither the noun in the direct case nor the agent noun, but rather that it is the direct object of the sentence.\n\nHere, the indirect object or \"benefactee\" Pedro is marked with si, the personal direct noun marker. The suffix -an indicates that the noun in the direct case (Pedro) is also the indirect object of the action, which would not have been known otherwise. Maria is marked with the personal ergative noun marker ni, which indicates that Maria is not the noun in the direct case but is still the agent of the sentence. Kalamay is marked with the general oblique indefinite marker og, indicating that kalamay is neither the noun in the direct case nor the agent noun, but rather that it is the direct object.\n\nHere, it is similar to the \"Circumstantial Trigger\" (with benefactee subject) in that the goal subject Perla is also the indirect object of the sentence. It is also marked by si, the personal direct noun marker, and it is known to be the indirect object of the sentence thanks to the verb suffix -an indicating that the noun in the direct case would be the indirect object of the sentence.\n\nHere, the instrument lapis is marked with ang, the general direct noun marker. The prefix I- indicates that the noun in the direct case (lapis) is also the instrument used to complete the action, which would not have been known otherwise. Linda is marked with the personal ergative noun marker ni, which indicates that Linda is not the noun in the direct case but is still the agent of the sentence. Sulat is marked with the general oblique indefinite marker og, indicating that sulat is neither the noun in the direct case nor the agent noun, but rather that it is the direct object.\n\nPronouns are inflected for person, number and case. No gender distinctions are made for the third person singular: \"he\" and \"she\" are both translated in Cebuano as \"siya\".\nThe three cases are direct, ergative and oblique.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> - \"Ta\" only when the object is the second person singular, i.e., \"ka\", \"mo\", etc. For example, \"Nakita ta ka\", NOT \"*Nakita ko ka\".\n\nThe short forms are used most often in conversation. However, the full forms \"must\" be used when they occur on their own as a predicate.\n\nExamples (Those marked with an asterisk, \"*\", are ungrammatical):\n\nBut...\n\nIn Cebuano, like most other Austronesian languages, the first person plural forms encode clusivity. This distinction, not found in most European languages, signifies whether or not the addressee is included.\n\nExamples:\n\nCebuano demonstratives are as follows:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> When the demonstrative is used as a predicate, the full form must be used.<br>\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Both forms, those beginning with 'ng-' and those with 'd-', are interchangeable and correspond to the deictives below.<br>\n<nowiki>†</nowiki> Although not represented in the orthography, forms in this row end in a glottal stop:<br>kana /kanaˀ/, na /naˀ/, niana /niˀanaˀ/, nganha /ŋanhaˀ/, diha /dihaˀ/, dinha /dinhaˀ/.\n\nExamples:\n\nUnsa kini/ni?<br>\n\"What's this?\"\nKinsa kana/na?<br>\n\"Who is that?\"\nGikan ning sulata sa Presidente sa Pilipinas.<br>\n\"This letter is from the President of the Philippines\"\nMangaon sila didto.<br>\n\"They will eat there.\"\nNikaon kadtong mga tawo ug mga bata didto sa piyesta/pista.<br>\n\"Those people and children ate/eat/are eating at the feast.\"\n\nDeictics, words such as \"here\" and \"there\", reference locations between the speaker and addressee. In addition to the same four-way distinction of proximity for demonstratives (\"near speaker\", \"near speaker and addressee\", \"near addressee\" and \"remote\"), deictics can express three tenses:\n\n\nThe present and future tense forms can precede or follow the words or phrases they modify by linking with nga. The past tense forms, however, only have a past meaning if they precede their words or phrases. If they follow, they convey no tense.\n\nThe 'ng-' forms are always tenseless. They follow the words or phrases they modify and can substitute equivalent past forms. In addition, they show movement or motion to the relative location which past forms cannot.\n\n<nowiki>†</nowiki> Forms in this row end in a glottal stop:<br>naa /naˀaˀ/, anaa /ˀanaˀaˀ/, diha /dihaˀ/, dinha /dinhaˀ/, anha /ˀanhaˀ/, diha /dihaˀ/, dinha /dinhaˀ/, nganha /ŋanhaˀ/.\n\nExamples:\n\nCebuano nouns fall into of two classes: personal and general. Personal nouns refer to persons or personified objects and animals and names. All other nouns fall into the general category. Nouns do not inflect for case or number: Case is shown using case markers; the plural number is show with the particle mga.\n\nCebuano nouns assume three cases based on their role in a sentence:\n\nThe use of sa VS. og in the oblique case is a matter of definiteness when the noun is the object of an actor-focus verb. Compare the following examples.\n\n\nIn example sentence 1, the car that John bought is particular. It may have been a car he was thinking about buying or one that the speaker was selling John. In 2, the speaker may or may not know the specifics about the car in question.\n\nPlurality is shown by preceding the noun with the particle mga /maŋa/.\n\nThere are special cases though:\n\n1. Adding the prefix \"ka-\" before and the suffix \"-an\" can pluralize a noun (the suffix \"-han\" is used if the root word ends with a vowel). This word treatment is used to group what are considered identical objects as one entity. Examples are:\n\nAlthough it is tolerable in some cases, the use of \"mga\" before a noun applied with \"ka- -an\" is not necessary anymore. \"ang mga kabataan\" (the children) is considered redundant, and \"ang kabataan\" is more grammatically accurate.\n\nBecause the use of \"ka- -an\" groups objects into one entity, there are cases that a word will mean a place of which the objects are frequently or usually found/exist. An example is:\n\n2. There is this very rare case of which an adjective can be pluralized and the noun it described can be, but not necessarily, omitted.\nExample: the word \"gamay\" ('small') can be changed to \"gagmay\" ('small ones')in which \"g\" was inserted in between. The same can be applied to \"dako\" which means 'big', changing it to \"dagko\" (big ones). Other examples are:\n\nThis rule cannot be applied to all other adjectives.\n\nAs a rule, Cebuano does not categorize nouns by gender. Natural gender are found in Spanish loans.\n\nAdjectives do not inflect for the plural. Common adjectives of measurement, however, have a plural form characterized by the infixation of /g/. \nIn comparing two similar items, the comparative form indicates that one has a higher degree (or lower degree) of the quality expressed by the root, e.g., \"bigger\", \"smaller\", \"greater\", etc.\n\nThe comparative degree is expressed in the following ways:\n\nThe comparative superlative indicates the maximum degree of the quality expressed in comparison to other items. In Cebuano this degree can be expressed by a prefix, pinaka- or by the use of the particle labi (\"most\").\n\nThe absolute superlative is the form used in exclamations, for example, \"How pretty you are!\"\", and denote the extreme quality of the root.\n\nIt is formed by prefixing Pagka- or Ka- (short form) to the root. The subject follows in the \"oblique\".\n\nExamples:\n\nTo express intensity, adjectives are followed by 'kaayo' (\"very\").\n\nExamples:\n\nThe linker nga (pronounced /ŋa/) shows the relationship between modifiers to the head of the phrase. Examples of such relationships are adjective-noun, clause-noun, adverb-verb, adverb-adjective and noun-noun. Without the intervening linker, juxtaposition of modifier and head can constitute, not a phrase, but a sentence unto itself. \nCompare the phrase \"ang batang lalaki\" \"the/a young man/boy\" and the sentence \"ang bata lalaki\" \"the child is male\" or \"the child is a boy\".\n\nAfter words that end in a monophthong, diphthong or \"-n\", nga is reduced to -ng /-ŋ/.\n\nUnlike Tagalog, nga is not used with numbers; ka below is used instead.\n\nThe linker ka is used to link a number and the phrase it modifies. Buok \"whole\" is sometimes used with ka.\n\n\n\"Na\" and \"pa\" are not used in the same sentence.\n\n\nThe word \"asa\" and \"hain\":\n\n\"Asa\" and \"hain\"—both mean \"where\"—have distinct uses in formal Cebuano usage.\n\n\"Asa\" is used when asking about a place.\n\n\"Hain\" is used when asking about a food or thing.\n\nIn spoken Cebuano, however, \"asa\" is commonly used to replace \"hain\". In fact, \"hain\", except by older generations, is rarely used.\n\nA \"Verb Root\" is the simplest version of a verb that cannot be broken down further (excluding morphological processes and colloquial speech) and conveys its overall meaning or lemma. Affixes for the \"Voices\", \"Moods\", \"Forms\", and \"Aspects\" may not be added to the \"Verb Root\", only to the \"Verb Stem\". Sometimes, the \"Verb Stem\" is identical to the \"Verb Root,\" while other times, the \"Verb Stem\" is created through the addition of certain affixes not related to the affixes of the \"Voices\", \"Moods\", \"Forms\", and \"Aspects\". A commonly known stem affix could be \"pa+\", added to the beginning of a \"Verb Stem\" or \"Verb Root\" in order to convey the meaning \"to cause\". For example, \"padala\" is the \"Verb Stem\" which means \"to send\" while \"dala\" is its own \"Verb Stem\" which means \"to bring\", concluding that \"padala\" could literally mean \"to cause to bring\". Another commonly known affix is \"hi+\" which is added to \"Verb Stems\" in the \"Stative Form\" so that the verb may take in a \"Direct Object\", as verbs in the \"Stative Form\" would not be able to take in a Direct Object without it.\n\nVerbs in Cebuano conjugate not only according to the \"Topic\" of the sentence, but also to the \"Mood\", the \"Form\", and the \"Tense\", more accurately described as the \"Aspect\", of the action. Cebuano verbs conjugate accordingly through the addition of affixes to the \"verb stem\".\n\nThere are three \"Moods\" that the verb may conjugate to in the Cebuano language. The three moods are:\n\nThis is the default mood of verbs in which the action is most commonly described. This mood \"does\" have imperative \"aspects\" in certain \"Forms\".\n\nThis is the mood where the action is unexpected or unintended. There is no imperative \"aspect\" for this mood. This mood is a little differently used in Cebuano than its usual use, see Mirative Mood. Some also consider to describe this mood as Dubitative or Subjunctive.\n\nThis is the mood where the action is able to happen or allowed to happen. This mood may also be used to convey a statement or general possibility. There is no imperative \"aspect\" for this mood.\n\nThe prefixes \"naka+\" and \"maka+\" (mostly used for this mood) may be shortened to \"ka+\" in colloquial speech and in colloquial writing, which may get rid of the aspect within the prefixes. This could be similar to \"naga+\" and \"maga+\" being shortened to \"ga+\", see below.\n\nThere are four \"Forms\" that the verb may conjugate to in the Cebuano language. The four forms are:\n\nThis is the form where the action was, is, or will be instantly completed. This form is also the form where the action may just be a statement and can be somewhat neutral in meaning.\n\nThis is the form where the action takes place over a not-always-specific duration of time. See Durative Aspect.\n\nThis is the form where the action is expressing the state of being something is in or its condition or even its emotion. This mood also may express a change going on within something. Usually, verbs that express this mood do not have \"Direct Objects\" unless the prefix \"hi+\" is added to the original \"Verb Stem\". This addition forms another \"Verb Stem\" which now allows the verb to have a \"Direct Object\".\n\nThis is the form where the action is being reciprocated between two persons/things to each other.\n\nCebuano generally does not use \"Tense\", rather it uses \"Aspect\". Cebuano verbs conjugate according to the \"Voice\", the \"Mood\", the \"Form\", and the \"Aspect\". According to the functionalist school of grammar, there are two aspects: the \"nasugdan\" (Incepted [Past/Present Inchoative]) aspect and the \"pagasugdan\" (Incepting [Future/Habitual Inchoative]) aspect. They claim that Cebuano verbs have the aspect of inception; that is whether the action has been initiated or not. \n\nThe \"nasugdan\" aspect is the aspect where the action had already started in the past, while the \"pagasugdan\" aspect is the aspect where the action has not started yet. Basically, past and present actions are in the \"nasugdan\" aspect while future actions and habitual actions are in the \"pagasugdan\" aspect. Although habitual actions started in the past, they have yet to start again. Hence, they are in the \"pagasugdan\" aspect.\n\nThe \"\"Imperatibo\"\" (Imperative/Command) mood is commonly grouped together with these aspects (and not with the other moods) because there are multiple imperatives of the same verb that exist according to which \"Form\" is in use.\n\nIn Cebuano, verbs conjugate for \"Negatibo\" (negative) sentences. However, the verb itself is not negative, it just \"agrees\" with the negative words \"wala\" and \"dili\" through \"negatibo\" verb affixes. \"Wala\" is used for the \"Nasugdan\" aspect and \"Dili\" is used for the \"Pagasugdan\" aspect. \"Ayaw\" is used as the negative imperative, see Prohibitive mood.\n\nVerb Affixes for Voice, Mood, Form, and Aspect may overlap. Some of these affixes are shortened in speech and informal writing.\n\nNot all groups of affixes can be used for some verbs; some verbs may not make sense with certain groups of affixes. For example, the verb stem \"anhi\", which generally means \"to come\", cannot have any of the passive voices' affixes. The only way to know which groups of affixes are able to be used for each verb stem are through memorization, online lists, or experience of each verb stem one comes across. In addition to that, in certain verbs, the affixes take on different meanings and overlap with other \"Forms\" due to historical use. For example, the verb stem \"buak\", \"to break\", uses the same affixes of the \"Potential Mood\" as the \"Transitory Form\" in the \"Indicative Mood\". Using the literal affixes of the \"Transitory Form\" in the \"Active Voice\" for \"buak\" would sound incorrect to native speakers. For the most part, the way the affixes are labeled are the way they are used. Exceptions can be learned through experience. \n\nNow, here is the more in-depth list of all of the \"proper, grammatical\" affixes used for each voice:\n\nThe \"Active Voice\" in Cebuano (a.k.a. \"the Agent Trigger\") is the Voice where the \"Topic\" of the sentence is the \"Agent\" (a.k.a. \"the Doer, the Subject, the Actor\") of the sentence. The verb partly conjugates according to the fact that the \"Agent\" is the \"Topic\". All \"Active Voice Affixes\" are actually prefixes.\nThese affixes not only have the essence that they are instantaneous, but they also have the essence of intention; that the topic willed for it to happen. It also has the essence of motion or movement. The prefix mi+ is more formal than ni+; otherwise, they are interchangeable. It is common to use pag+ because it is a common imperative affix in the Active Voice in Cebuano.\n\nWith verb stems like \"adto\", mo+ may sometimes be used as the \"nasugdan\" aspect because although it started in the past and may still be going on, the destination may not have been reached yet. \"Adto\" also means \"to go\", and when used in the present tense, it is understandable that it may use mo+ for a \"nasugdan\" aspect.\n\nThe prefixes naga+ and maga+ may be shortened to ga+ in colloquial speech and in colloquial writing, which may indicate a lack of aspect but it still preserves the form. Some argue that the difference between nag+ and mag+ versus naga+ and maga+ are either in formality (naga+ and maga+ being more formal) or in tense (naga+ being more in the present and nag+ being more in the past, while maga+ and mag+ are interchangeable).\n\nThe prefixes naka+ and maka+ may be shortened to ka+ in colloquial speech and in colloquial writing, which may get rid of the aspect within the prefixes. This could be similar to naga+ and maga+ being shortened to ga+.\n\nPlurality depends on whether the topic is a plural noun. The topic may be the subject, the object, etc., however, because this is the Active Voice, the topic should always be the Subject with these plural affixes. As long as the subjects are plural, the plural version is usually used, but this is not always mandatory. Some verbs only use the plural version while other verbs are rarely used in their plural versions. \n\n\nSometimes pang+ is used as the plural version of the imperatibo mood.\n\nThe \"Stative Form\" does not have a \"Potential Mood\". The hi+ prefix before gugma is necessary for the verb to take in a direct object, so the \"imperatibo examples\" would imply a direct object. The nagka+ and magka+ prefixes are different from the na+ and ma+ in that they have the essence of a slowly but surely, or steady, change that is occurring within the topic. They are not used as often anymore, so the same essence may be achieved with the na+ and ma+ prefixes nowadays. However, pagka+ just has more emphasis than ka+ may have, and pagka+ is still commonly used today. The \"Mirative Mood\" with the nagka+ and magka+ prefixes is no longer known nor used. The plural prefixes nang+ and mang+ become nanga+ and manga+ if the verb also includes these prefixes: na+, ma+, and ka+. For example, \"Nangahigugma kami kanimo.\" which means \"We love you.\" \n\nThe \"Reciprocal Form\" does not have a \"Potential Mood\". This form is not in common use anymore.\n\nThe \"Passive Voice for Direct Objects\" in Cebuano (a.k.a. \"the Patient Trigger\") is the Voice where the \"Topic\" of the sentence is the \"Direct Object\" (a.k.a. \"the Patient, the Goal, etc.\") of the sentence. So the verb partly conjugates accordingly.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Imnon and Imna went through some of the \"Morphological Processes\" in Cebuano. The \"Mirative\" and \"Potential Moods\" are the same for these forms of affixes. In the \"negatibo aspect,\" the ergative personal pronouns are usually put before the verb. A noun in the ergative case, or a proper noun in the ergative case, would both be put after the verb. For example, \"Dili imnon sa iring ang gatas.\" which means \"The milk will not be drunk by the cat.\"\nThe \"Passive Voice for Indirect Objects\" in Cebuano (a.k.a. \"the Circumstantial Triggers\") is the Voice where the \"Topic\" of the sentence is the \"Indirect Object\" (a.k.a. \"the Benefactee, the Location, the Goal, etc.\") of the sentence. So the verb partly conjugates accordingly.\nIn the examples, the topic is the dog (the \"Indirect Object\") and it is used as the topic to emphasize that the dog got the gift, nothing else. In context, a person may say this to you when you are confused about whom/what you should get the gift for. Perhaps there is a cat and a dog and the person clarifies that you got/get/will get/should get a gift for the dog (not the cat).\nThe \"Passive Voice for Instruments\" (a.k.a. \"the Instrumental Trigger\") is the Voice where the \"Topic\" of the sentence is the \"Instrument\" of the sentence. The \"Instrument\" is the noun that is used for the action of the sentence.\nThe prefix gi+ may also be used/confused as \"Both the Transitory & Durative Forms\" in the \"Passive Voice of Direct Objects\".\n\nThe prefixes i+ and i+ may be confused as one another but context will be sufficient for distinction.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> In context, the key usually cannot open the boss. However, if you want to be creative and say we opened the boss for the door, \"para\" or \"alang\" can be added before the indirect object to mean \"for\". Through context, \"para\" and \"alang\" and other prepositions for \"for\" are unnecessary. The \"sa\" marker may replace either or both of the \"og\" markers for definiteness and/or distinction. The \"og\" disappears if \"para\" or \"alang\" is used, but if \"sa\", \"ni\", or \"kang\" is there instead, \"sa\", \"ni\", and \"kang\" may stay.\n\nThere are over 1000 different verbs in Cebuano to choose from and to use. There are many more affixes that can be used for verb roots, verb stems, and new words. \n\n1) equational ( topic = predicate ) \n~ in this sentence type you can interchange the topic and the predicate without changing the thought of the sentence.\n\n2) non-equational ( topic < predicate )\n~ in this sentence type the topic and the predicate are not interchangeable.\n\n3) existential sentence of presence\n~ sentences of this type tells the existence of a thing or idea.\n\n4) existential sentence of possession\n~ sentences of this type tell about someone or something possessing something.\n\n5) locative sentence\n~ this type of sentence tells the location of a thing.\n\n6) meteorologic sentence\n~ this type of sentence tells about weather condition, noise level, etc., of a place. \n\n7) exclamatory remark\n~ praises and unexpected discoveries belong here.\n\n8) imperatives\n~ commands and requests\n\n9) interrogatives\n~ questions that are not answerable by yes or no.\n\n10) confirmation\n~ questions that are basically answered by yes or no. constructed like the first 6 sentence type with the insertion of the particle \"ba\" as a second term.\n\n"}

He served as Undersecretary for Foreign Trade from 5 November 1982, until 14 July 1986, in the Cabinet Lubbers I. And again a Member of the House of Representatives from 3 June 1986, until 24 September 1988, when he became Minister of Defence from 24 September 1988, until 7 November 1989, in the Cabinet Lubbers II. He again returned to the House of Representatives on 14 September 1989, and nine months later on 1 May 1990, he became the Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives and the Leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. He served in this position for eight years until 30 July 1998.\n\nFrom 15 September 1999, until 22 November 2004, he was the European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services. In the European Commission, Bolkestein was responsible for internal market taxation and customs union issues. Some of the more politically sensitive items in his portfolio were the draft community patent regulation and the draft directives on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions and services in the internal market, the so-called \"Bolkestein Directive\", which has become the focus of heated debate.\n\nFrederik Bolkestein was born on 4 April 1933 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. His father was president of the Court in Amsterdam. His grandfather, Gerrit Bolkestein, was Minister of Education, Arts, and Sciences to the Dutch government-in-exile of 1939 to 1945. Bolkestein's mother was born in the Dutch East Indies to Dutch parents.\n\nBolkestein attended the Barlaeus Gymnasium in Amsterdam from 1945 to 1951, where he majored in both arts and sciences. Upon completing his gymnasium education, he was an undergraduate in mathematics at Oregon State College from 1951 to 1953. Subsequently he went to the University of Amsterdam, where he received a BSc degree in mathematics and physics in 1955. In 1959 he received a MA degree in philosophy and Greek from the same university. Bolkestein subsequently received a BSc degree from The London School of Economics in 1963, and an LLM degree from Leiden University in 1965.\n\nDuring his studies in Amsterdam, Bolkestein was editor for the satirical student magazine \"Propria Cures\". He was also a member of the board of the student union ASVA.\n\nBefore entering Dutch politics, Bolkestein worked for the oil company Royal Dutch Shell from 1960 to 1975. During this period he was assigned to postings in East Africa, Honduras and El Salvador, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and France. In Paris, he served on the board of the Shell Chimie from 1973 to 1975. During his tenure with Shell, he completed the first part of the economics program at the London School of Economics in 1964 and he also completed a law degree at Leiden University, graduating in 1965.\n\nIn 1976, Bolkestein wrote an English language play named \"Floris, Count of Holland\", under the anagrammatic pseudonym of Niels Kobet.\n\nBolkestein left Shell in 1978 and became a member of parliament for the VVD. From 1982–1986, he served as Minister of International Trade. After joining the parliament again, he was Minister of Defence from 1988–1989. In 1990 he was elected Leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy of the VVD, a position he held until 1998. Between 1978 and 1999, when he became European Commissioner, he was member of parliament for 17 years.\n\nDuring the 1990s, he was very successful as the political frontman of the VVD. As an opinion leader, he was known for his daring and controversial positions on such issues as multicultural problems in Dutch society, political dualism between government and parliament, and the structure and expansion of the European Union. From 1990–1994 he was the parliamentary opposition leader and continued his outspoken and independent style when his party was part of the government from 1994. During the provincial elections of 1995, his criticism of Dutch immigration policies made his party the largest of the country.\n\nIn 1996, his political integrity came under heavy criticism, because it was revealed he had written a letter to the Minister of Health Els Borst, in which he asked her to help a pharmaceutical company, of which Bolkestein was member of the board of commissioners. The incident was known as the \"Dear Els\"-incident, because the letter was addressed to Borst personally.\n\nHe was president of the Liberal International, the world federation of liberal political parties. Since Autumn 2004, he has been a professor at the Dutch universities of Leiden and Delft. Former Irish finance minister Charlie McCreevy succeeded him as Commissioner for the Internal Market.\n\nHe authored a number of books on politics and related subjects. Frits Bolkestein is married to Femke Boersma, a retired Dutch actress. In 2005, his house in northern France had its electricity cut briefly by the local energy company after he criticized French protectionist measures against incoming electricians from Eastern Europe.\n\nAlso, he is on the advisory board of OMFIF where he is regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.\n\nNamed after Frits Bolkestein, the Directive on services in the internal market aims at enabling a company from a given member-state to recruit workers in other European Union countries using the law of its home country. It triggered huge protests in Europe. This directive was voted in the European Parliament in March 2006 and the MEPs proposed amendments to the provisional text. The \"principle of origin\", which stipulates that workers are employed under the legal arrangements of their own state of residence, was replaced by a new \"freedom\" principle – freedom to provide services, meaning that administrative obstacles should be removed. The compromise allowed the draft Directive to continue to exist. However, there was a great deal of concern about its effect on social standards and welfare, triggering competition between various parts of Europe. This led to significant protests across Europe against the directive including a notable protest at the European Parliament in Strasbourg by port workers which led to damage to the building. MEPs eventually reached a compromise on the text and the Parliament adopted it on 12 December 2006; 2 years after Bolkestein left office, under the Barroso Commission.\n\nIn 2001, Bolkestein responded to the question raised by European MPs (MEP) Harlem Désir, Glyn Ford and Francis Wurtz, who asked the Commission to investigate the accusations brought forward by \"Révélation$\", a book written by investigative journalist Denis Robert and former Clearstream member Ernest Backes, and to ensure that the 10 June 1990 directive (91/308 CE) on control of financial establishment be applied in all member states in an effective way. Commissioner Frits Bolkestein applied that \"\"the Commission has no reason to date to believe that the Luxembourg authorities do not apply it vigorously\".\" (\"sic\") The three MPs henceforth published a press statement asking the opening of an investigation by the European Union about the correct application of 10 June 1990 directive.\n\nOn 26 April 2006, French daily \"20 minutes\" revealed that \"in May 2005, MEP Paul van Buitenen was shocked by Frits Bolkestein's presence in Bank Menatep's international consultative council (owned by Russian magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky), a sulfurous Russian banking establishment, and by his work for Shell, British-Dutch petrol company. Two firms 'detaining secret accounts in Clearstream' ... Van Buitenen, also Dutch, then asked for 'clarification' to the European Commission and the opening of a parliamentary investigation. The Commission's president, José Manuel Barroso, answered that these facts \"don't bring up any new question\" and that it is not known \"if Menatep took contact with Bolkestein while he was in his functions\". No investigation thereby took place.\" The free daily underlines that \"in 2001, it was Bolkestein himself that announced the Commission's refusal to open up a parliamentary investigation on Clearstream\", following MEP Harlem Désir's requests and accusations that Menatep had an \"undeclared account\" at Clearstream. Bolkestein refused to answer any questions by the newspaper.\n\nOn 18 May 2010, Bolkestein advocated for the legalization of all drugs in an article called; \"Red het land, sta drugs toe\" which translates to; \"save the nation, allow drugs\" in the NRC Handelsblad, a Dutch newspaper. The article is endorsed by many professionals ranging from Els Borst, former Dutch minister of public health, to many jurists, professors and drug experts.\n\nIn \"Het Verval\" (\"The Decline\"), a book about Jews in the Netherlands written by Manfred Gerstenfeld, a Holocaust survivor and senior researcher at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Bolkestein is quoted as having said that practicing Jews had no future in the Netherlands, due to anti-semitism among Turkish and particularly Moroccan immigrants, and that they should emigrate to the United States or Israel. Bolkestein's remarks, after having been published in a Dutch newspaper, raised a storm of criticism in December 2010. According to Ronny Naftaniel, head of the Jewish organisation CIDI, this was not the first time Bolkestein has expressed this view.\n\n\n"}

The institution is based in the Coulonhûs and adjacent buildings in Leeuwarden. Together with several other institutes it belongs to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). It has about 60 employees. In addition, some 300 scientists, amateurs and professionals, are active in the scientific societies hosted by the Fryske Akademy.\n\nAlthough the academy's mission includes a wide scope of Friesland-related topics, a great deal of its work focuses particularly on the West Frisian language. It has also done a great deal to regulate the language. The Fryske Akademy publishes the \"\" (Dictionary of the (West) Frisian Language), which serves as the language's principal authority.\n\nIt also does a good deal of research regarding the language, history, and culture of the Frisian people. Since its inception, it has published almost 1,000 scientific books, thousands of articles, and a large number of reports on these subjects. A few larger projects include:\n\nThe social purpose of the Fryske Akademy is, as its statutes have it, the maintenance of societies for the study of Friesland, in which professional scientists and amateur scientists participate. The societies are in part responsible for the large number of books which the Fryske Akademy produces. Very active societies include the Genealogical Society, the Archaeological Society, and the Biological Society. Active or passive participation in these societies is open to everyone paying his dues as a donor of the Fryske Akademy. There are about 3000 donors, each paying a minimum of 25 euro a year. \n\nIn addition, the Fryske Akademy carries out contract research for third parties, such as the provincial authorities for whom the Fryske Akademy investigated the quality of language education at primary level. It also contributed to the development of test for speech therapy for West Frisian, which made it possible to assess children’s linguistic progress in West Frisian. Up till then, only a Dutch test had been used, which gave distorted results in the case of bilingual children.\n\nThe academy is also the home of Fryske Rie foar Heraldyk, a heraldic advisory board for the Frisian region.\n\nThe Fryske Akademy was founded in 1938 with the support of the provincial authorities at the behest of many pro-Frisian politicians and scientists, notably the historian Geart Aeilco Wumkes and the theologian Titus Brandsma. Before the foundation of the Fryske Akademy, two societies were concerned with Frisian science:\nThese 19th-century societies regarded themselves as the intellectual heirs to the University of Franeker, which was abolished by Napoleon and which the government of the new Kingdom of the Netherlands failed to reopen. To some extent, the Fryske Akademy considers itself a successor to the University of Franeker.\n\n\n"}

Her father was Ahmed Al-Samman, a president of the Syrian University. She was deeply influenced by him since her mother died at a very young age.\n\nHer father was fond of both Western literature and Arabic literature; this influenced her deeply and gave her a unique style that combines attributes of both. Nevertheless, she soon was confronted with the conservative Damascene society in which she was raised and lived her early years.\n\nShe published her first book of short stories عيناك قدري \"“Your Eyes are my Destiny”\" in 1962 which was received reasonably well. However, she was lumped at the time with other traditional feminine writers. Her later publications took her out of the tight range of feminine and love novels to much wider social, feminist and philosophical extents.\n\nShe graduated from the Syrian University in 1963 with a BA in English Literature and left to Beirut to earn her master's degree in Theatre from American University of Beirut; since then she had not returned to Damascus.\n\nIn Beirut she worked in journalism and in 1965 she published her second collection لا بحر في بيروت \"“No Sea in Beirut”\" in which the effect of her new, now wider experiences are evident. She then traveled around Europe working as a correspondent and in 1966 published her third collection ليل الغرباء \"“Foreigners’ Nights”\" reflecting her experiences.\n\nThe Six-Day War had a shock effect on her as it did on many of her generation, this was evident in her famous article احمل عاري إلى لندن \"“I Carry My Shame to London”\", after that she did not publish any books for six years but her journalistic articles became closer to the social reality and made her popular. The articles she wrote during that period became the source of some of her later publications.\n\nIn 1973 she published her fourth collection, رحيل المرافئ القديمة \"“The Departure of Old Ports”\", considered by some critiques one of the most important of her works. In this collection of short stories she described in a literary fashion the dilemma of the Arab intellectual of the time and the conflict between his/her thought and actions. She published her first novel, بيروت 75 \"“Beirut 75”\" around the end of 1974. The novel describes the complex social problems in Beirut and started with a prophecy by one of the characters of the novel, a fortune teller that says: \"“I see blood, I see a lot of blood”\". A few months later the civil war broke out in Lebanon.\n\nAfter the publication of two more novels, كوابيس بيروت \"“Beirut Nightmares\"\" in 1977, which describes life in civil-war-torn Beirut in the mid-Seventies, and ليلة المليار \"“The Eve of Billion”\" in 1986, she was referred to as the most prominent modern Arab writer by some critics.\n\nIn the late 1960s Ghada married Bashir Al Daouq, the owner of Dar Al Tali’a publishing house and had her only son, Hazim, which she named after one of her heroes in \"“Foreigners' Nights”\". She later made her own publishing house and re-published most of her books, she also gathered all her articles in a series she called الأعمال غير الكاملة \"“The Unfinished Works”\", up to date she has published fifteen books of it, nine of them are poetry collections. She has stored her unpublished works including many letters in a Swiss bank, which she promises to publish \"“when the time is right”\".\n\nIt is believed that some of her letters may reveal some information about some prominent Palestinian writers and poets during the 1960s, of the people her name was linked with are: Nasir eDdin Al Nashashibi, the journalist and Kamal Nasir, the late poet.\n\nIn 1993 she caused a scene in the literary and political arenas when she published a collection of love letters written to her by Ghassan Kanafani in the sixties when she had a love affair with him, which was no secret at the time. She was condemned for publishing them by some claiming that her intention was to smear the late writer’s reputation and/or to negatively affect the Palestinian Cause.\n\nShe has also written a few criticism books and translated some of her works to several worldwide languages. Ghada has been living in Paris since the mid-1980s and regularly writes in an Arabic magazine published in London.

When she was an adult, Samman’s father died and she lost her job in a short period of time. She was left alone in the world.

This is when Samman became a strong advocate for liberty and self-expression for all people, but especially women. Samman is considered a feminist writer (Wordpress.com p. 3). She does not shy away from subjects seen by the public as taboo. She questions typical thought about women’s sexuality and the freedoms enjoyed by the upper class (Vinson 9-10).

The use of an exemplar is especially important to questioned document examination.\n\nHandwriting exemplars are used by a document examiner to determine the writing habits of an individual. Ideally, the exemplars will provide an adequate picture of the writer's habits such that a meaningful comparison can be conducted with the questioned material. \n\nThere are two types of handwriting exemplars that may be used; \"request\" writings and \"collected\" writings. Request writings are obtained from an individual specifically for the purposes of conducting a handwriting comparison whereas collected writings are samples the individual produced for some other, unrelated reason generally in the course of their day-to-day activities. \n\nThe two types of exemplars are complementary to one another. Request writings can be controlled to some degree by whoever obtains them. That is, it is possible to exercise some control over the writing to ensure that it is written in a comparable manner using a similar writing instrument, similar paper, etc. Most important, the text to be written is dictated to the writer so that it can either match the questioned text exactly or be modified to ensure comparability without exactly matching the text if, for example, the text itself should remain unknown. The primary concerns with request writing is that the writer might attempt to intentionally alter (disguise) their writing habits or the sample might not display the full range of the writer's natural variation. Collected writings are less likely to be affected by intentional alteration (disguise) and, if sufficient quantities can be obtained, should cover the writer's range of natural variation. As a result, the limitations of either type can be overcome by the other.\n\nThe following are a few examples of pre-determined text passages that have been used to obtain \"request\" exemplars. The text may be used exactly as shown here or modified to incorporate specific words or letter combinations that match the text of the questioned document. \n\nThe London Letter\nOur London business is good, but Vienna and Berlin are quiet.

The term often refers to the United States of America due to its status as the world's only current superpower; however, its possible status above that remains a topic of dispute.\n\nThe British journalist Peregrine Worsthorne coined the term in a \"Sunday Telegraph\" article published March 3, 1991. After the end of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, some political commentators felt that a new term was needed to describe the United States' position (\"Pax Americana\") as the lone superpower. French foreign minister Hubert Védrine popularized the term in 1998, because from France's position, the United States looked like a hyperpower, although the validity of classifying the United States in this way was disputed.\n\nThe term has also been applied retroactively to dominant states of the past. In her book \"Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance—and Why They Fall\", American professor Amy Chua suggests that the Achaemenid Empire, the Tang dynasty, the Roman Empire, the Mongol Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire were successful examples of historical hegemons; the Spanish Monarchy, Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and Third Reich were counters; and she reflects on assertions that the United States is a modern hyperpower. In a historical context, it is usually understood to mean a power that greatly exceeds any others in its political environment along several axes; Rome did not dominate Persia, Ancient India or China, but did dominate the entire Mediterranean area militarily, culturally, and economically.\n"}

The old, long-familiar phrase was made famous by Ma Nuo, a 20-year-old female contestant on the television show \"Fei Cheng Wu Rao\" (also known in English as \"If you are the One\"). The line was in response to a question by an unemployed suitor who asked if Ma would \"ride a bicycle with him\" on a date. The series of events have been summed up in the media with the quip \"I would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle.\"\n\nIn interviews after the show, Ma pointedly denied that she is a \"gold digger\" – saying that she \"just wanted to reject [her suitor] in a creative way.\" Nonetheless, the phrase has made its rounds across the Chinese blogosphere, and has become emblematic of the culture of materialism and lack of authenticity that now allegedly permeates Chinese society, particularly in the process of dating and courtship. Social commentator Chen Zhigang remarked, \"Does Ma Nuo only speak for herself? No. Her opinion resonates with youth; they have grown up in a society that is quickly accumulating material wealth. They are snobbish. They worship money, cars and houses because the highly developing economy has made them do so.\" \n\nThe blunt nature of the statement works well in the dating show's format, and is not the first controversial phrase to arise out of \"Fei Cheng Wu Rao\". It was cited by critics as a window to the \"degradation of Chinese social values,\" and even drew the attention of government censors, who eventually forced producers to re-design the format of the show to be more professional and 'clean' of morally questionable content. A \"Global Times\" commentary remarked that the obsession with BMWs is symbolic of a larger national trend that measures a person's success solely by money rather than factors such as \"knowledge, taste, kindness or vision.\" The phrase also earned notoriety for Ma, whose purported pictures began surfacing all over the internet despite strong dislike from the public.\n\nProfessor Jinhua Zhao of the University of British Columbia referred to the quote to allude to trends in the last decade of Beijing residents opting to get rid of their bikes in favour of cars as a mode of transport, citing the social perception that, \"bikes are now for losers.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "52468172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52468172", "title": "Karipúna French Creole language", "text": "Karipúna French Creole language\n\nKaripúna French Creole language is spoken by the Karipúna community, which lives in the Uaçá Indian Reservation in the state of Amapá, on the Curipi and Oyapock rivers. It is mostly French-lexified except for flora and fauna terms, with a complex mix of substratum languages—most notably the extinct Tupian Karipúna language.\n\nEthnologue considers Karipúna French Creole to be \"threatened,\" with a rating of 6b on the Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS). This designation seems generally due to the waning use of KFC as a mother tongue, and the steadily decreasing transmission rate. Anonby notes that Portuguese tends to be the mother tongue for speakers under 60 in the Karipúna community, and Karipúna French Creole is the mother tongue primarily only for speakers over 60.\n\nThe Karipúna community includes a mix of ethnicities to such a degree that at times (such as in the early 1930s) doubt arose as to whether or not the Karipúna should be referred to as Indians. Alleyne and Ferreira explain that \"today, the Karipúna people are a highly mixed group, comprising not only descendants of Amerindians, but also of Africans, Asians and Europeans, and mixtures thereof.\"\n\nJohn Ladhams offers what is probably the best description of the migration and formation of the current-day Karipúna population. Members of the Arawak, Tupí, and Carib linguistic trunks were in contact with European explorers since the 16th century, and around 1830 to the 1840s, due to the Cabanagem Revolt, a group of Amerindians from the Pará region moved to modern-day Amapá (which was, at the time, claimed by French Guinea) and joined with the present ethnic groups, thus coming into contact with French or Guyanais speakers. Moving between French Guiana and Brazil in hotly contested territory from the Ounary river, to the Oyapock river, and finally towards the Curipi river where the Karipúna now live, these groups were joined by \"members of the Palikúr and Galibí tribes, as well as Guianan Creoles, Arabs, Chinese, Europeans, and Brazilians\" and eventually settled in the Uaçá area. \"These were ‘displaced Brazilians … called Karipúnas’.\" Furthermore in 1854, due to a gold rush in Approuague, many \"coolies, Blacks, Chinese, Martinicans and French adventurers\" moved to the Oyapock and Uaçá rivers, where the Karipúna inhabited, further contributing to the broad ethnic mix.\n\nLadhams explains the adoption of a French creole by the group as a result of the broad ethnic backgrounds of the Karipúna. \"Since at least the 1840s,\" the Karipúna community was \"a highly disparate group ... and that there would have been an immediate need for a medium for inter-ethnic communication. A prime candidate for this would have been Guyanais,\" as it was already used by parts of the Amerindian members and most of the non-Amerindian members of the Karipúna community.\n\nIn December 1900, the Amapá region was ceded to Brazil from France, putting the Karipúna community in Brazilian territory, and in the 1920s, \"Brazilian authorities deemed it necessary to implement projects for occupying the formerly contested territory whose ‘frenchified’ populations were seen as a threat to the country's territorial integrity.\" As a result the Oiapoque Colonization Commission was created in 1920. Later in 1927, an inspection commission commanded by the Ministry of War began to patrol the Oiapoque and report on the groups living there. The reports were the first to use the term of \"Karipúna\" for the inhabitants of the Cupiri River, and has been the label employed since. The intent of the Ministry of War was to \"incorporate the Indians into society,\" and from 1934–37, and then from 1945 onwards, non-indigenous teachers were recruited by the government to teach in Karipúna villages. This education \"played a fundamental role in formulating the contemporary identity of these groups, in the propagation of the use of Portuguese and in the configuration of the villages.\"\n\nThe 1970s \"were marked by greater political participation of the Uaçá leaders,\" including the Karipúna amongst the other three groups in the Uaçá reserve, \"who began to act in more organized fashion.\" Particularly, they opposed the installation of the proposed route for the BR-156 highway, and this struggle resulted in further pressure to fight for the demarcation of their land. A new route of the highway was eventually accepted with \"the hiring of indigenous heads to assist in the inspection of the borders of the indigenous territory.\"\n\nIt was also during this period that the \"Kheuól-to-Portuguese bilingual education programme was instituted, largely through the efforts of CIMI (the Catholic mission) and with the approval of FUNAI, and later MEC.\" Since this period, there has been a stated focus on promoting the maintenance of KFC as a second language and defending Amerindian rights while also providing a \"bridge to the outside world,\" to a varying degree of success, often criticized, both by members of the community and linguistic anthropologists such as Jo-Anne Ferreira. Only in the 1990s did indigenous teachers, however, begin to receive training first by CIMI, then by the Organization of Indigenous Teachers of Oiapoque established in 2005, and now \"many of the teachers are Karipúna or Galibi-Marwono.\"\n\nOverall, Karipúna populations are healthily growing after the original migration from Pará that lessened populations drastically. Alleyne and Ferreira note that \"the Karipúna population in 2001 is six times larger than it was in 1943.\" However, despite the optimistic growth in population, the linguistic vitality of Karipúna French Creole is threatened.\n\nToday in the Uaçá Reservation there are three other Amerindian groups: the Galibi-Marwono, who also speak a French Creole language incredibly similar to Karipúna, and the Palikúr and Galibi do Oiapoque indigenous groups who speak their own non-creole languages. Members of the latter groups are often bilingual in Amapá French Creole, though only the Karipúna and Galibi-Marwono speak AFC natively. Anonby finds that \"the differences between all the French Creoles do not pose a serious problem to intelligibility.\"\n\nThe Karipúna people numbered 1,726 between 16 different villages in 2001. The largest, \"Manga\", contained 465 people. They are far more dispersed as compared to the Galibi-Marwono community in the same reservation, wherein 1,578 out of a total population of 1,787 Galibi-Marwono are concentrated in the \"Kumaruma\" village.\n\nEthnologue considers Karipúna French Creole to be \"threatened,\" with a rating of 6b on the Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS). This designation seems generally due to the waning use of KFC as a mother tongue, and the steadily decreasing transmission rate. Anonby notes that Portuguese tends to be the mother tongue for speakers under 60 in the Karipúna community, and Karipúna French Creole is the mother tongue primarily only for speakers over 60. Anonby paraphrases from interviews with speakers, that \"although most people understand KFC,\" a Karipúna speaker \"admitted about half of the people in the village of Manga cannot speak it. He said there were no monolingual Karipúna speakers.\" Speakers of KFC tend to speak it as a second language, first learning Portuguese, and only learning KFC via a three-year Kheuól education primary school programme implemented by CIMI.\n\nAnonby notes that \"generally, [Karipúna] people feel that the loss of KFC is not a good thing. They feel nostalgia for the time when they all spoke it. At the same time, people feel very positive about speaking Portuguese.\" Ferreira likewise confirms this, referencing the \"discontent felt by many indigenous leaders\" who feel as though the state of education in KFC is not of a sufficient standard to be beneficial for the maintenance of KFC. This program was implemented in the 1980s by CIMI, the Catholic mission, but recently a new modified version of this program, the \"Projeto Político Pedagógico das Escolas Indígenas Karipúna e Galibi-Marworno\", is in the process of being implemented, although the value of the new program in maintaining KFC is unclear. Overall, due to the difficulty in transmitting the language to younger speakers as either a mother tongue or second language, KFC is justifiably in a threatened state.\n\nFrench creoles in Brazil form two sub-groups, both in the Amapá regions. Southern Amapá consists only of \"Amapá French Creole\" (or \"Lanc-Patúa\") and is spoken mainly around Macapá, the capital of Amapá state. Northern Amapá consists of two (relatively mutually intelligible) French-lexified creoles, both of which are considered \"Amazonian French Creole,\" also often referred to as \"Kheuól,\" \"Crioulo,\" and \"Patuá.\" The two languages are \"Karipúna French Creole\" (KFC) as well as \"Galibi-Marwono French Creole\" (GMFC)\n\nAlleyne and Ferreira, inspired by Ladham's social history generally agree that KFC is a direct descendent of Guyanais, or Guianan French Creole. As noted above, Ladham interprets the language as a tool which the ethnically fragmented early Karipúna communities employed to meet an \"immediate need for a medium for inter-ethnic communication.\" This confirms that KFC's superstratum language is primarily French, but the other influences on the language are diverse and numerous. Alleyne and Ferreira suggest that the original \"Karipúna\" language — that is, that spoken by the original emigrants from Pará — \"may or may not\" have been a Tupi-Guarani language, and contributed to parts of the lexicon. Chris Corne notes that the indigenous influence is \"substantial, particularly in the vocabulary of flora and fauna.\n\nDespite the contact with African speakers that GFC no doubt had in its creolization process, Corne explains that \"the African contribution, on present information, is surprisingly small, including only a handful of words from Bantu, Kwa, and Senegambian languages,\" although the African influences in grammar are more obvious. Lastly and unsurprisingly Corne mentions that \"Portuguese has contributed basic vocabulary\" of KFC for both lexical and functional categories of words. Some Kheuól words are even used in variation with Portuguese contributions to the lexicon, \"for example, stilo and kanét (‘pen’), la nét and janél (‘window’)\", generally as a result of increasing sociohistorical pressures from the mid-1900s as the Portuguese education system began to erode the transmission of KFC.\n\nKaripúna do Amapá is referred to by a wide variety of names colloquially and in linguistic literature, including \"Karipúna do Norte (Karipúna French Creole),\" Kheuól, Crioulo, Patoá, Patuá, Patúa, and Amazonian/Amapá/Amerindian French Creole (which all also include the closely related Galibi-Marwono French Creole language). Ethnologue refers to the language as \"Karipúna Creole French.\"\n\nTolber provided what is apparently the first rigorous descriptive grammar of KFC. His account includes a lexicon with around 300 words, phonetic description of KFC, and analysis of the grammar at sentence, clause, word, and morpheme-level. The description is in-depth, categorical, and provides examples for various basic and complex sentence structures and clause types, along with justification of the classifications made. Based on Tobler's description and elicitation test, a phonetic inventory was made available for KFC online. Ladhams also notes that Monserrat & Silva published a grammar of Karipúna in Portuguese in 1984.\n\nAlso, in the same decade, two Karipúna-Portuguese dictionaries were published by A.W. Tobler (1987) and Montejo (1988). Tobler's \"Dicionário Crioulo Karipúna\" is published in Portuguese and contains an (approximately) 2100 Karipúna words with their Portuguese translation, and vice versa, and also provides an IPA pronunciation guide for Kheuól orthography. Picanço's \"O nosso dicionário Português-Kheuol\" is apparently unavailable online.\n\nCorne criticizes the \"lack of serious lexicological research\" for Karipúna French Creole and Guyanais in general. Despite the relatively large focus on documentation in the 1980s, little other linguistic documentation appears to be available. Ferreira states that \"the Catholic mission, CIMI, has been largely responsible for promoting a three year Kheuól education primary school programme.\" According to CIMI statements, the Karipúna and Galibi-Marwono have been working since 1978 to develop this educational process, but the \"materials [for language education]\" are not readily available and are most likely used in the community for the three-year language education program. According to Anonby some of the Karipúna French Creole texts have been published and they are \"mainly Biblical stories and folk tales,\" along with language \"primers, such as those edited and organized by Fransisca Picanco Montejo (1985).\"\n\nThe majority of rigorous Karipúna linguistic documentation was done in the 1980s, with Tobler (1983), Tobler (1987), Monserrat & Silva (1984) and Picanço (1988). Present-day language documentation agencies (such as Soas, Museu do Índio, Museu Goeldi, and Dobes, amongst others) do not seem to have assisted in the documentation of KFC.\n\nAnonby's A Report on the Creoles of Amapá is the result of a joint study between SIL and the University of the West Indies to \"investigate sociolinguistic aspects of the French-lexifier Creole languages spoken in the state of Amapá,\" albeit not funded by a particular major documentation project.\n\nA series of anthropological analyses of the Karipúna community have been undertaken, especially in light of the Karipúna identity and schooling system. Tassinari and Cohn in 2009 critically evaluated, just like Ferreira, the bilingual education program and demonstrated the caveats in the CIMI-organized three-year educational programme. Ladhams is a well-cited and succinct socio-historical investigation of the Karipúna community's origins, which is generally accepted by anyone writing about KFC ethnography afterwards.\n\nKaripúna French Creole has 32 phonemes — 22 consonants and 10 vowels. Its phoneme inventory is notably smaller than its lexifier language, French.\n\nKaripúna French Creole's 22 phonemic consonants are shown in the table below.\nKaripúna French Creole's consonants are relatively similar to French, with some exceptions. The palatal nasal stop, /ɲ/, voiced uvular fricative, /ʁ/, and labialized palatal approximant, /ɥ/, or /jʷ/, all of which are present in French, are not in KFC. Furthermore, /t/ and /d/ from French are dentalized in KFC. Lastly /h/ is present phonemically in KFC, despite having been lost in French due to historical sound changes.\n\nKaripúna French Creole has 10 phonemic vowels.\n\nAgain, compared to French's 17 vowels, KFC is significantly less complicated, losing //, //, //, //, //, //, and //.\n\nNonetheless, the French influence is obvious. Like in French, only the open-mid and open vowels have phonemic nasalized variants. Alleyne and Ferreira note that this is consistent with other French creoles, and evidence for the hypothesis that all (or many) Atlantic French Creole languages descended from a common creole ancestor.\n\nRelative to French and its substratum languages, Karipúna French Creole is more morphologically isolating, as tends to be the case with Caribbean Creole Languages. Morphemes in Karipúna French Creole are either root forms or derivational affixes, and inflectional affixes are apparently not present. Tobler notes that most words are monomorphemic.\n\nThe \"verbalizing\" suffix /-e/ however can coerce some nouns into a verb class.\n\nThe \"verbalizing\" suffix /-e/ however can coerce some nouns into a verb class.\n\nPronouns in KFC form a two-number and three-case system, which is undergoing a regularizing change by analogy. The /li/ pronoun, and /ka/ tense marker (see below), will elide with an adjacent verb. The KFC lexicon on the whole is greatly derived from French and has undergone a process more morphological agglutination and \"article reduction.\" Ladhams suggests that the Karipúna community is historically composed of \"French Guinean Blacks, Chinese, Arabs, and Europeans,\" although the extent of non-European influence, outside of flora and fauna words, appears to be minimal. Arab and Chinese lexical influence is virtually nonexistent. Thus the generic open class of nouns involves morphologically reducing \"la + noun\" or \"l’ + noun\" to a monomorphemic word.\n\nKaripúna French Creole's personal pronouns form a two-number, three-person system as in French, and are shown in the table below.\n\nThe distinction between subject, direct object, and indirect object pronouns from French is simplified to a set of personal pronouns in KFC, which may occupy both subject and object position.\n\nKFC has a no-case system and retained the nominative form, whereas other French creoles retained the oblique form.\n\nTobler, and Alleyne and Ferreira, give slightly different accounts of the pronouns, and the table above generally reflects the more recent account. Tobler does not make note of the /to/ and /so/ variants of the 2nd and 3rd person singular pronouns, which Alleyne and Ferreira explain is not present in other French creoles, (346) and is thus presumably an innovative change, by analogy with the 1st person singular /mo/. Similarly, Tobler cites /nu/ as the 1st person plural pronoun, but Alleyne and Ferreira explain that KFC has \"regularized\" this to /no/. The 2nd and 3rd person plural pronouns are consistent between accounts.\n\nIn Alleyne and Ferreira, the bare possessive pronouns and the forms with the /-pa/ suffix are taken as equals. However, Tobler refers to the /-pa/ form as \"possessive pronouns,\" and the bare form as \"possessive adjectives.\" The difference appears to be that the pronominal form can occasionally fill a DP (as English \"mine\") as well as act as a genitive adjunct to a noun phrase (/u-pa liv/, \"your book\"), whereas the bare possessive form must be adjunct to the possessed NP.\n\nAlleyne and Ferreira give a simple account of reflexive pronouns by appending the /-kɔ/ suffix, but Tobler's grammar explains the nuance of KFC reflexives. To indicate a reflexive pronoun, KFC uses the bare possessive form in the object position and appends the word \"body\" (/kɔ/), or the body part affected, as the possessed NP of the pronoun.\nposition (in bold below).\n\nIn the case that no body part is affected, KFC can also use /mɛm/ for the emphatic self.\n\nKaripúna French Creole both in historical sound shifts and in present variation has agglutinative morphophonemic changes. As in many French Creole languages, many French calques were glossed into KFC and subsequently agglutinated with a French definite article. Alleyne and Ferreira list four classes, based on the original French determiner.\n\nSome of these classes are open, such as class I, which takes new words loaned from French, while the others are not. The morphological reduction of the French article from these words does not have a consistent result on the syntactic category, despite all being non-proper nouns. Tobler claims that \"almost all words are monomorphemic roots\" in KFC, and the morphological reanalysis from French loanwords appears to move towards this conformity, as the French article, nor the noun stem, are \"never found in isolation.\"\n\nMorphophonemic shifts also occur in the 3rd-person singular pronoun and the present progressive marker in KFC. In the pre-verbal subject position, /li/ is often reduced to /i-/, and reduced to a verb suffix /-l/ in the post-verbal object position.\n\nThe present tense marker /ka/, like /li/, also elides with non-back vowels at the beginning of a preceding verb.\n\nMorphophonemic reanalysis produces agglutination in KFC. Morpheme reanalysis and agglutination of this variety is common in creole languages, especially French-lexified creoles. Amongst French creole languages some of these categories are shared, but others are not, and Alleyne and Ferreira (amongst others) suggest that this may be an effective area of research for understanding the origins and development of French creole languages.\n\nReduplication is often considered a hallmark of creole language morphology, along with morphological conversion and compounding. Compounding, as above, is present in KFC, and as expected so too is reduplication. Tobler (1983) notes the highly productive reduplication possible in KFC. \n\nTobler shows that reduplication in possible in a large variety of syntactic and morphological contexts. In all cases it tends to \"emphasize the degree or quantity of that which is reduplicated,\" which corresponds to the generalized \"more of the same meaning.\"\n\nCreole languages tend to be characterized by a lack of \"complex inflectional morphology in general,\" and appropriately syntactically- or morphologically-induced changes in verb valency are generally rare. Tobler's grammar does however mention a limited passive syntactic construction, as well as a causative transitive construction. No mention of other valency-changing constructions, such as antipassives or comitative case, seem to be present in any investigation of the language.\n\nAs seems to be the case with the majority of Creole languages, Karipúna French Creole lacks a true passive voice. Papiamento may be the only Atlantic Creole to possess a full passive.\n\nTobler notes that outside of certain stative clauses, the passive form can’t be used. Utterances are expressed solely in the active form. For example, the phrase \"I was bitten by a wasp\" must be expressed as \"the wasp bit me,\" as below:\n\nAnd the expression \"all the bananas were eaten\" might be expressed in either of the following ways:\n\nWith active (\"c.f.\" stative) verbs in Karipúna French Creole, the passive form cannot be used. While in (3) the number of arguments has been reduced to only a subject (‘banana’), /hete/ is an intransitive verb typically. In other words, Karipúna French Creole non-stative verbs do not have a valency-reducing form.\n\nAs stated before, the vast majority of French creoles lack a passive form. While in some French creole communities a passive form can be used, such as in Haitian French Creole, it doesn’t seem to be considered a part of a creole itself, but rather a French borrowing (Mandaly 2011). Jacobs analyzes another potential source for creole passives, however, suggesting that substratum origins and contact with earlier creole languages likely was the result of the oddly-distributed use of the passive in Papiamento, rather than top-down European-language influence.\n\nTobler demonstrates how a pseudo-passive can be formed by coercing the verb into a verbal adjective, turning a monotransitive sentence into an intransitive one.\n\nCompared with the active construction:\n\nThis kind of construction for the verb is not necessarily a full passive, and can only form strictly stative constructions, using only auxiliary or verb-null copula phrases. Tobler notes \"one cannot say, ‘The house was painted by John’; this must be expressed actively as ‘John painted the house’\" (Tobler 1983, 54). Clearly in this phrase /pẽtʃihe/ is no longer functioning as a VP in the passive construction, as it cannot take an agentive adjunct (‘by John’).\n\nInteraction with verb stativity appears to be a common feature of Atlantic creole languages, and Winford (1988) looks to creole passivity to discuss the possible West African origins of the passive form. Karipúna French Creole's semi-passive verbal adjective form may, rather than the result of a superstratum French influence, be a construction derived from one of Karipúna's many substratum languages.\n\nKaripúna French Creole does have a causative construction, using the auxiliary verb \"make\" (/fɛ/), which appears to be a widely productive, valency-increasing form. The \"make\" auxiliary changes either an intransitive construction into a transitive one, or a transitive to a ditransitive.\n\nIt is apparent that there is a valency increase with the introduction of the \"make\" auxiliary, given that the tense marker \"te\" is no longer present in the /mo lẽj sɛk/ verbal compliment(s). While KFC can, and often does, use a null tense marker to indicate present completeness for \"experience and state\" verbs, like /sɛk/, the gloss Tobler provides gives no evidence of a present-complete meaning. Therefore, we analyze this not as an embedded CP complement to /fɛ/, but rather as a valency-increase of the VP /sɛk/ from intransitive to monotransitive.\n\nA similar analysis can be taken to the monotransitive-to-ditransitive use of /fɛ/. Tobler's gloss suggests that the null past complete tense marker that \"event and process\" verbs take applies to \"make,\" rather than \"chop\" in the causative construction, and therefore does not represent mere CP-embedding.\n\nKaripúna French Creole's system of tense marking is complex, with \"five overt tense markers and another [null] marker.\" However the meaning of the null tense marker is dependent on the class of verb phrase.\n\nTobler (1983) distinguishes five classes of verb phrase: Event, Experience, Process, State A, and State B. State A and B are typically copular, comparative, possessive or similar phrases that lack a main verb statement. KFC non-auxiliary verbs fall into the categories of Event, Experience, and Process verbs. Event verbs typically include transitives such as /ale/, \"go,\" and /aʃte/, \"buy.\" Experience and Process verbs, vaguely, characterize intransitive experiences and processes, although Tobler fails to provide specific examples of the distinctions. Tobler does note that Event and Experience verbs take a semantic agent, while Process and State phrases lack one, such that Experience verbs (like /sɔtʃi/, \"leave/get out,\" and /asi/, \"sit\") could be analyzed as unergatives, and Process verbs (like /bule/, \"be burned,\" and /tõbe/, \"fall\") as unaccusatives.\n\nTense marking for sentences in KFC interacts with the class of verb phrase in the sentence. All classes of VP use the /ke/ future tense marker, and /teke/ conditional tense marker.\n\nExclusive to Event and Process class VPs is the present progressive /ka/ marker, and the past incomplete tense marker /teka/. For event and process verbs, a null tense marker is analyzed as the past complete tense.\n\nFor Experience and State class VPs, the past complete tense is marked by the tense marker /te/, whereas the null tense marker is understood as the present progressive tense.\n\nThe \"conditional tense marker\" /teke/ indicates a strictly hypothetical conditional relation (\"if S had been, H would have\"). The conditional marker /si/ can also be used with other tense markers than /teke/ however, but requires strict correspondence between the markers used. Tobler distinguishes three kinds of conditional constructions, employing distinct uses of the tense markers.\n\nThe first conditional, \"authentic\" construction is used for genuine, specific, events, that haven’t occurred yet. This construction uses the present progressive tense marker /ka/ in the conditional phrase and the future tense marker /ke/ in the result phrase. For example:\n\nThe (former) conditional clause in this construction can also drop /ka/, with no apparent semantic change.\n\nThe \"generalization\" conditional construction applies to general rules and principles about the world, using the null tense marker in the conditional phrase and the present progressive /ka/ in the result phrase, as such:\n\nThe hypothetical conditional construction translates roughly to \"if S had been, H would have,\" and uses the past complete /te/ marker for the conditional clause, and the conditional /teke/ marker for the main clause. This construction applies strictly to hypothetical situations that might have happened, rather than ones that have habitually (the generalization construction) or may in the future (the \"authentic\" construction).\n\n"}
{"id": "689427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=689427", "title": "Latent semantic analysis", "text": "Latent semantic analysis\n\nLatent semantic analysis (LSA) is a technique in natural language processing, in particular distributional semantics, of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms. LSA assumes that words that are close in meaning will occur in similar pieces of text (the distributional hypothesis). A matrix containing word counts per paragraph (rows represent unique words and columns represent each paragraph) is constructed from a large piece of text and a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the number of rows while preserving the similarity structure among columns. Words are then compared by taking the cosine of the angle between the two vectors (or the dot product between the normalizations of the two vectors) formed by any two rows. Values close to 1 represent very similar words while values close to 0 represent very dissimilar words.\n\nAn information retrieval technique using latent semantic structure was patented in 1988 (US Patent 4,839,853, now expired) by Scott Deerwester, Susan Dumais, George Furnas, Richard Harshman, Thomas Landauer, Karen Lochbaum and Lynn Streeter. In the context of its application to information retrieval, it is sometimes called latent semantic indexing (LSI).\n\nLSA can use a term-document matrix which describes the occurrences of terms in documents; it is a sparse matrix whose rows correspond to terms and whose columns correspond to documents. A typical example of the weighting of the elements of the matrix is tf-idf (term frequency–inverse document frequency): the weight of an element of the matrix is proportional to the number of times the terms appear in each document, where rare terms are upweighted to reflect their relative importance.\n\nThis matrix is also common to standard semantic models, though it is not necessarily explicitly expressed as a matrix, since the mathematical properties of matrices are not always used.\n\nAfter the construction of the occurrence matrix, LSA finds a low-rank approximation to the term-document matrix. There could be various reasons for these approximations:\n\n\nThe consequence of the rank lowering is that some dimensions are combined and depend on more than one term:\n\nThis mitigates the problem of identifying synonymy, as the rank lowering is expected to merge the dimensions associated with terms that have similar meanings. It also mitigates the problem with polysemy, since components of polysemous words that point in the \"right\" direction are added to the components of words that share a similar meaning. Conversely, components that point in other directions tend to either simply cancel out, or, at worst, to be smaller than components in the directions corresponding to the intended sense.\n\nLet formula_1 be a matrix where element formula_2 describes the occurrence of term formula_3 in document formula_4 (this can be, for example, the frequency). formula_1 will look like this:\n\nNow a row in this matrix will be a vector corresponding to a term, giving its relation to each document:\n\nLikewise, a column in this matrix will be a vector corresponding to a document, giving its relation to each term:\n\nNow the dot product formula_9 between two term vectors gives the correlation between the terms over the set of documents. The matrix product formula_10 contains all these dot products. Element formula_11 (which is equal to element formula_12) contains the dot product formula_9 (formula_14). Likewise, the matrix formula_15 contains the dot products between all the document vectors, giving their correlation over the terms: formula_16.\n\nNow, from the theory of linear algebra, there exists a decomposition of formula_1 such that formula_18 and formula_19 are orthogonal matrices and formula_20 is a diagonal matrix. This is called a singular value decomposition (SVD):\n\nThe matrix products giving us the term and document correlations then become\n\nSince formula_23 and formula_24 are diagonal we see that formula_18 must contain the eigenvectors of formula_10, while formula_19 must be the eigenvectors of formula_15. Both products have the same non-zero eigenvalues, given by the non-zero entries of formula_23, or equally, by the non-zero entries of formula_30. Now the decomposition looks like this:\n\nThe values formula_32 are called the singular values, and formula_33 and formula_34 the left and right singular vectors.\nNotice the only part of formula_18 that contributes to formula_36 is the formula_37 row.\nLet this row vector be called formula_38.\nLikewise, the only part of formula_39 that contributes to formula_40 is the formula_41 column, formula_42.\nThese are \"not\" the eigenvectors, but \"depend\" on \"all\" the eigenvectors.\n\nIt turns out that when you select the formula_43 largest singular values, and their corresponding singular vectors from formula_18 and formula_19, you get the rank formula_43 approximation to formula_1 with the smallest error (Frobenius norm). This approximation has a minimal error. But more importantly we can now treat the term and document vectors as a \"semantic space\". The row \"term\" vector formula_48 then has formula_43 entries mapping it to a lower-dimensional space dimensions. These new dimensions do not relate to any comprehensible concepts. They are a lower-dimensional approximation of the higher-dimensional space. Likewise, the \"document\" vector formula_50 is an approximation in this lower-dimensional space. We write this approximation as\n\nYou can now do the following:\n\nTo do the latter, you must first translate your query into the low-dimensional space. It is then intuitive that you must use the same transformation that you use on your documents:\n\nNote here that the inverse of the diagonal matrix formula_62 may be found by inverting each nonzero value within the matrix.\n\nThis means that if you have a query vector formula_53, you must do the translation formula_64 before you compare it with the document vectors in the low-dimensional space. You can do the same for pseudo term vectors:\n\nThe new low-dimensional space typically can be used to:\nSynonymy and polysemy are fundamental problems in natural language processing: \n\nLSA has been used to assist in performing prior art searches for patents.\n\nThe use of Latent Semantic Analysis has been prevalent in the study of human memory, especially in areas of free recall and memory search. There is a positive correlation between the semantic similarity of two words (as measured by LSA) and the probability that the words would be recalled one after another in free recall tasks using study lists of random common nouns. They also noted that in these situations, the inter-response time between the similar words was much quicker than between dissimilar words. These findings are referred to as the Semantic Proximity Effect.\n\nWhen participants made mistakes in recalling studied items, these mistakes tended to be items that were more semantically related to the desired item and found in a previously studied list. These prior-list intrusions, as they have come to be called, seem to compete with items on the current list for recall.\n\nAnother model, termed Word Association Spaces (WAS) is also used in memory studies by collecting free association data from a series of experiments and which includes measures of word relatedness for over 72,000 distinct word pairs.\n\nThe SVD is typically computed using large matrix methods (for example, Lanczos methods) but may also be computed incrementally and with greatly reduced resources via a neural network-like approach, which does not require the large, full-rank matrix to be held in memory.\nA fast, incremental, low-memory, large-matrix SVD algorithm has recently been developed. MATLAB and Python implementations of these fast algorithms are available. Unlike Gorrell and Webb's (2005) stochastic approximation, Brand's algorithm (2003) provides an exact solution.\nIn recent years progress has been made to reduce the computational complexity of SVD; for instance, by using a parallel ARPACK algorithm to perform parallel eigenvalue decomposition it is possible to speed up the SVD computation cost while providing comparable prediction quality.\n\nSome of LSA's drawbacks include:\n\n\n\nIn semantic hashing documents are mapped to memory addresses by means of a neural network in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. Deep neural network essentially builds a graphical model of the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. This way of extending the efficiency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster than locality sensitive hashing, which is the fastest current method.\n\nLatent semantic indexing (LSI) is an indexing and retrieval method that uses a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify patterns in the relationships between the terms and concepts contained in an unstructured collection of text. LSI is based on the principle that words that are used in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings. A key feature of LSI is its ability to extract the conceptual content of a body of text by establishing associations between those terms that occur in similar contexts.\n\nLSI is also an application of correspondence analysis, a multivariate statistical technique developed by Jean-Paul Benzécri in the early 1970s, to a contingency table built from word counts in documents.\n\nCalled \" indexing\" because of its ability to correlate related terms that are in a collection of text, it was first applied to text at Bellcore in the late 1980s. The method, also called latent semantic analysis (LSA), uncovers the underlying latent semantic structure in the usage of words in a body of text and how it can be used to extract the meaning of the text in response to user queries, commonly referred to as concept searches. Queries, or concept searches, against a set of documents that have undergone LSI will return results that are conceptually similar in meaning to the search criteria even if the results don’t share a specific word or words with the search criteria.\n\nLSI overcomes two of the most problematic constraints of Boolean keyword queries: multiple words that have similar meanings (synonymy) and . Synonymy is often the cause of mismatches in the vocabulary used by the authors of documents and the users of information retrieval systems. As a result, Boolean or keyword queries often return irrelevant results and miss information that is relevant.\n\nLSI is also used to perform automated document categorization. In fact, several experiments have demonstrated that there are a number of correlations between the way LSI and humans process and categorize text. Document categorization is the assignment of documents to one or more predefined categories based on their similarity to the conceptual content of the categories. LSI uses \"example\" documents to establish the conceptual basis for each category. During categorization processing, the concepts contained in the documents being categorized are compared to the concepts contained in the example items, and a category (or categories) is assigned to the documents based on the similarities between the concepts they contain and the concepts that are contained in the example documents.\n\nDynamic clustering based on the conceptual content of documents can also be accomplished using LSI. Clustering is a way to group documents based on their conceptual similarity to each other without using example documents to establish the conceptual basis for each cluster. This is very useful when dealing with an unknown collection of unstructured text.\n\nBecause it uses a strictly mathematical approach, LSI is inherently independent of language. This enables LSI to elicit the semantic content of information written in any language without requiring the use of auxiliary structures, such as dictionaries and thesauri. LSI can also perform cross-linguistic concept searching and example-based categorization. For example, queries can be made in one language, such as English, and conceptually similar results will be returned even if they are composed of an entirely different language or of multiple languages.\n\nLSI is not restricted to working only with words. It can also process arbitrary character strings. Any object that can be expressed as text can be represented in an LSI vector space. For example, tests with MEDLINE abstracts have shown that LSI is able to effectively classify genes based on conceptual modeling of the biological information contained in the titles and abstracts of the MEDLINE citations.\n\nLSI automatically adapts to new and changing terminology, and has been shown to be very tolerant of noise (i.e., misspelled words, typographical errors, unreadable characters, etc.). This is especially important for applications using text derived from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and speech-to-text conversion. LSI also deals effectively with sparse, ambiguous, and contradictory data.\n\nText does not need to be in sentence form for LSI to be effective. It can work with lists, free-form notes, email, Web-based content, etc. As long as a collection of text contains multiple terms, LSI can be used to identify patterns in the relationships between the important terms and concepts contained in the text.\n\nLSI has proven to be a useful solution to a number of conceptual matching problems. The technique has been shown to capture key relationship information, including causal, goal-oriented, and taxonomic information.\n\n\nLSI uses common linear algebra techniques to learn the conceptual correlations in a collection of text. In general, the process involves constructing a weighted term-document matrix, performing a Singular Value Decomposition on the matrix, and using the matrix to identify the concepts contained in the text.\n\nLSI begins by constructing a term-document matrix, formula_68, to identify the occurrences of the formula_69 unique terms within a collection of formula_70 documents. In a term-document matrix, each term is represented by a row, and each document is represented by a column, with each matrix cell, formula_71, initially representing the number of times the associated term appears in the indicated document, formula_72. This matrix is usually very large and very sparse.\n\nOnce a term-document matrix is constructed, local and global weighting functions can be applied to it to condition the data. The weighting functions transform each cell, formula_71 of formula_68, to be the product of a local term weight, formula_75, which describes the relative frequency of a term in a document, and a global weight, formula_76, which describes the relative frequency of the term within the entire collection of documents.\n\nSome common local weighting functions are defined in the following table.\n\nSome common global weighting functions are defined in the following table.\n\nEmpirical studies with LSI report that the Log and Entropy weighting functions work well, in practice, with many data sets. In other words, each entry formula_71 of formula_68 is computed as:\n\nA rank-reduced, singular value decomposition is performed on the matrix to determine patterns in the relationships between the terms and concepts contained in the text. The SVD forms the foundation for LSI. It computes the term and document vector spaces by approximating the single term-frequency matrix, formula_68, into three other matrices— an m by r term-concept vector matrix formula_82, an r by r singular values matrix formula_83, and a n by r concept-document vector matrix, formula_84, which satisfy the following relations:\n\nformula_85\n\nformula_86\n\nformula_87\n\nIn the formula, A is the supplied m by n weighted matrix of term frequencies in a collection of text where m is the number of unique terms, and n is the number of documents. T is a computed m by r matrix of term vectors where r is the rank of A—a measure of its unique dimensions ≤ min(\"m,n\"). S is a computed r by r diagonal matrix of decreasing singular values, and D is a computed n by r matrix of document vectors.\n\nThe SVD is then truncated to reduce the rank by keeping only the largest k « r diagonal entries in the singular value matrix S,\nwhere k is typically on the order 100 to 300 dimensions.\nThis effectively reduces the term and document vector matrix sizes to m by k and n by k respectively. The SVD operation, along with this reduction, has the effect of preserving the most important semantic information in the text while reducing noise and other undesirable artifacts of the original space of A. This reduced set of matrices is often denoted with a modified formula such as:\n\nEfficient LSI algorithms only compute the first k singular values and term and document vectors as opposed to computing a full SVD and then truncating it.\n\nNote that this rank reduction is essentially the same as doing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the matrix A, except that PCA subtracts off the means. PCA loses the sparseness of the A matrix, which can make it infeasible for large lexicons.\n\nThe computed T\" and D\" matrices define the term and document vector spaces, which with the computed singular values, S\", embody the conceptual information derived from the document collection. The similarity of terms or documents within these spaces is a factor of how close they are to each other in these spaces, typically computed as a function of the angle between the corresponding vectors.\n\nThe same steps are used to locate the vectors representing the text of queries and new documents within the document space of an existing LSI index. By a simple transformation of the A = T S D equation into the equivalent D = A T S equation, a new vector, d, for a query or for a new document can be created by computing a new column in A and then multiplying the new column by T S. The new column in A is computed using the originally derived global term weights and applying the same local weighting function to the terms in the query or in the new document.\n\nA drawback to computing vectors in this way, when adding new searchable documents, is that terms that were not known during the SVD phase for the original index are ignored. These terms will have no impact on the global weights and learned correlations derived from the original collection of text. However, the computed vectors for the new text are still very relevant for similarity comparisons with all other document vectors.\n\nThe process of augmenting the document vector spaces for an LSI index with new documents in this manner is called \"folding in\". Although the folding-in process does not account for the new semantic content of the new text, adding a substantial number of documents in this way will still provide good results for queries as long as the terms and concepts they contain are well represented within the LSI index to which they are being added. When the terms and concepts of a new set of documents need to be included in an LSI index, either the term-document matrix, and the SVD, must be recomputed or an incremental update method (such as the one described in ) be used.\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that the ability to work with text on a semantic basis is essential to modern information retrieval systems. As a result, the use of LSI has significantly expanded in recent years as earlier challenges in scalability and performance have been overcome.\n\nLSI is being used in a variety of information retrieval and text processing applications, although its primary application has been for concept searching and automated document categorization. Below are some other ways in which LSI is being used:\n\n\nLSI is increasingly being used for electronic document discovery (eDiscovery) to help enterprises prepare for litigation. In eDiscovery, the ability to cluster, categorize, and search large collections of unstructured text on a conceptual basis is essential. Concept-based searching using LSI has been applied to the eDiscovery process by leading providers as early as 2003.\n\nEarly challenges to LSI focused on scalability and performance. LSI requires relatively high computational performance and memory in comparison to other information retrieval techniques. However, with the implementation of modern high-speed processors and the availability of inexpensive memory, these considerations have been largely overcome. Real-world applications involving more than 30 million documents that were fully processed through the matrix and SVD computations are common in some LSI applications. A fully scalable (unlimited number of documents, online training) implementation of LSI is contained in the open source gensim software package.\n\nAnother challenge to LSI has been the alleged difficulty in determining the optimal number of dimensions to use for performing the SVD. As a general rule, fewer dimensions allow for broader comparisons of the concepts contained in a collection of text, while a higher number of dimensions enable more specific (or more relevant) comparisons of concepts. The actual number of dimensions that can be used is limited by the number of documents in the collection. Research has demonstrated that around 300 dimensions will usually provide the best results with moderate-sized document collections (hundreds of thousands of documents) and perhaps 400 dimensions for larger document collections (millions of documents). However, recent studies indicate that 50-1000 dimensions are suitable depending on the size and nature of the document collection.\n\nChecking the amount of variance in the data after computing the SVD can be used to determine the optimal number of dimensions to retain. The variance contained in the data can be viewed by plotting the singular values (S) in a scree plot. Some LSI practitioners select the dimensionality associated with the knee of the curve as the cut-off point for the number of dimensions to retain. Others argue that some quantity of the variance must be retained, and the amount of variance in the data should dictate the proper dimensionality to retain. Seventy percent is often mentioned as the amount of variance in the data that should be used to select the optimal dimensionality for recomputing the SVD.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to its cross-domain applications in Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Cognitive Science and Computational Linguistics, LSA has been implemented to support many different kinds of applications.\n"}

Some European languages, like Russian and Irish, contrast a palatalized lateral–rhotic pair with an unpalatalized (or velarized) set (e.g. in Russian). Czech uses two liquid consonants and its grammar allows the creation of numerous long, sound vowel-less sentences with liquid consonants underlying every syllable (strč prst skrz krk, or \"push your finger through your throat\", is a classic example).\n\nElsewhere in the world, two liquids of the types mentioned above remains the most common attribute of a language's consonant inventory except in North America and Australia. In North America, a majority of languages do not have rhotics at all and there is a wide variety of lateral sounds though most are obstruent laterals rather than liquids. Most indigenous Australian languages are very rich in liquids, with some having as many as seven distinct liquids. They typically include dental, alveolar, retroflex and palatal laterals, and as many as three rhotics.\n\nOn the other side, there are many indigenous languages in the Amazon Basin and eastern North America, as well as a few in Asia and Africa, with no liquids.\n\nPolynesian languages typically have only one liquid, which may be either a lateral or a rhotic. Non-Polynesian Oceanic languages usually have both and , occasionally more (e.g. Araki has , , ) or less (e.g. Mwotlap has only ).

Most commentators assume that this referred to their \"slippery\" effect on meter in classical Greek verse when they occur as the second member of a consonant cluster. This word was calqued into Latin as \"liquidus\", whence it has been retained in the Western European phonetic tradition.\n\n"}

They tend to be swing voters and they tend to vote split-ticket more than well-informed voters do. Researchers attribute this to low-information voters not having developed clear cut ideological preferences.\n\nLinguist George Lakoff has written that the term is a pejorative mainly used by American liberals to refer to people who vote conservative against their own interests and assumes they do it because they lack sufficient information. Liberals, he said, attribute the problem in part to deliberate Republican efforts at misinforming voters.\n\nIn a 2011 article titled \"Goodbye to All That: Reflections of a GOP Operative Who Left the Cult\", thirty-year Republican House of Representatives and Senate staffer Mike Lofgren characterized low-information voters as anti-intellectual and hostile-to-science \"religious cranks\" and claimed Republicans are deliberately manipulating low information voters to undermine their confidence in American democratic institutions.\n\nPopular syndicated talk show host Rush Limbaugh became aware of the term in the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election, initially joking that it could be interpreted to signify stupidity. However, Limbaugh later clarified that a low information voter may also be considered in his view a \"high liberal information voter\", expounding on media bias thusly: \"I have never said that low-information voters are stupid. I just said they don't know what they think they know. They are prisoners to the media, which has dumbed them down. Low-information voters can be doctors. Low-information voters can be scientists. They can be among all walks of life. It has nothing to do with IQ. It has to do with what they don't know because of their media sources. Low-information voters are clearly people that don't have all the information available to make a voting choice. That's all they are. And they're all over the place. And most of them do vote Democrat. Most of them did vote for Obama. It's not a comment on their intelligence. It's not that they're stupid or don't understand the issues. They just haven't had it all explained to them\".\n\nA 2012 paper by six American political scientists called \"A Theory of Political Parties: Groups, Policy Demands and Nominations in American Politics\" challenged the idea that Republicans want a low-information electorate and argued instead that both major American parties do. Noting that 95% of incumbents in the highly polarized House of Representatives win re-election despite voters' preference for centrist representation, the paper theorizes that voters' infrequent penalizing of extremist behaviour represents not approval, but a lack of attention and information. This, the paper says, is supported by the fact that when congressional districts and media markets overlap to create more informed electorates, extremist House members are at much greater risk for defeat. The paper proposes that in the American political system interest groups and activists are the key actor and that the electorate is uninformed and bamboozled.\n\nA 1992 study found that in the absence of other information voters used candidates' physical attractiveness to draw inferences about their personal qualities and political ideology. A study performed using logistic regression analysis on data from the 1986 through 1994 American National Election Studies found that low-information voters tend to assume female and black candidates are more liberal than male and white candidates of the same party. A 2003 study that analyzed precinct-level data from city council elections held in Peoria, Illinois between 1983 and 1999 found that the placement of candidates' names on the ballot was a point of influence for low-information voters. An analysis concerned with the \"puzzling finding\" that incumbent legislators in mature democracies charged with corruption are not commonly punished in elections found that less-informed voters were significantly more likely to vote for incumbents accused of corruption than were their better-informed counterparts, presumably because they did not know about the allegations.\n\nIn September 2012, comedian Bill Maher made fun of undecided voters on his HBO program \"Real Time\" by calling them \"low-information voters, otherwise known as dipshits\". Also in September, the NBC program \"Saturday Night Live\" ran a mock public service announcement featuring undecided low-information voters asking questions such as \"When is the election?\" and \"Who is the president right now? Is he or she running?\".\n\nIn January, 2013, Alicia Colon used the similar phrase \"low-info\" in her column \"Low-Info Voters Just Not Interested In Politics\" for the \"Irish Examiner USA\" newspaper.\n\nIn November 2016, Claire Lehmann, editor of \"Quillette\", wrote an essay discussing why the term \"low information voters\" is disturbing as high information voters are essentially the ones suffering from more confirmation bias.\n\n"}

He argues that the concept of Being in Heidgger, was already present in the concept of Totality in Lukács. Lukács's critique of the alienation inherent in capitalism, is thus present in Dasein as an ontological concept. Both Lukács and Heidegger critique the reification or thing-ification of the human dasein. Inauthentic dasein is parallel to the failure of the historical subject to awaken to praxis.\n\nGoldmann argues that the concept of reification as employed in \"Being and Time\" (1927) showed the strong influence of Lukács's work \"History and Class Consciousness\" (1923).\n\nThe fundamental goal of both Heidegger and Lukács was to overcome the traditional subject-object dichotomy of Western Philosophy.\n\nLaurence Paul Hemming, writing in \"Heidegger and Marx\" (2013), finds Goldmann's suggestion that Lukács influenced Heidegger to be highly unlikely at best.\n"}

Written using Cyrillic, it was sent by Neacșu Lupu, a boyar from Dalgo Pole, Wallachia (now Câmpulung, Romania) to Johannes Benkner, the mayor of Brassó, Kingdom of Hungary (now Brașov, Romania), warning him about the imminent attack of the Ottoman Empire on Transylvania.\n\nNeacșu Lupu was a 16th-century Wallachian boyar from Câmpulung, the son of Neacșu Mircea, mentioned for the first time during Vlad cel Tânăr's reign (1510–1512), in documents related to a trial regarding debts between himself and merchants of Brașov. It is possible that he was himself a merchant involved in the trade of Turkish goods that he was buying south of the Danube and selling in Transylvania, which may explain his relationship with the mayor of Brașov.\n\nThe Letter of Neacșu of Câmpulung to Johannes (Hans) Benkner of Brașov was most probably written on June 29 or 30, 1521, in the city of \"Dlăgopole\" (Old Bulgarian rendition/translation of Câmpulung, lit. \"the long field\"). The date is not mentioned within the letter itself, it being inferred from the historic events described and the people mentioned.\n\nThe letter was discovered in 1894 by Wilhelm Stenner, the archivar of Brașov.\n\nThe text of the letter was written in the Cyrillic script, and is composed of three parts. The introduction in Old Bulgarian language, translated: \"To the most wise and noble and venerable and by God endowed master Hanas Begner of Braşov, all the best, from Neacșu of Câmpulung\".\n\nFollowing the Bulgarian introduction, the content of the letter is written in the old Romanian language. As opposed to the first documents of other languages, which are in general more ancient, the Romanian language used in this letter is very similar to the language spoken in the present day. The Romanian linguist Aurel Nicolescu stated that no less than 175 words of the 190 found in the letter have Latin origins, this not counting the repeated words and the names. Some incorrect forms of different words appear due to the difficulty of representing some Romanian sounds like \"ă\" and \"î\", while using the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nNeacșu Lupu’s letter contained a secret of great importance, warning Johannes Benkner of Brașov about Turkish preparations for an invasion through Transylvania and Wallachia.\n\nVarious Slavonic expressions are also present throughout the content of the letter, such as \"I pak\", which in Bulgarian means \"and again\" and has a similar meaning to the Latin \"item\", but is also used to mark the beginning of a new sentence, as no punctuation marks are present in the text. Another Bulgarian word is \"za\", meaning \"about\".\n\nThe letter ends with another sentence written in Bulgarian, which means: \"And may God bring happiness upon you. Amen.\"\n\n\n\"Mudromu I plemenitomu, I cistitomu I B[o]gom darovannomu zupan Hanăș Begner ot Brașov mnog[o] zdravie ot Nécșul ot Dlugopole.\n\nI pak dau știre domnietale za lucrul turcilor, cum am auzit eu că împăratul au ieșit den Sofiia și aimintrea nu e.

{"id": "22310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22310", "title": "Outing", "text": "Outing\n\nOuting is the act of disclosing an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity without that person's consent. Outing gives rise to issues of privacy, choice, hypocrisy, and harm in addition to sparking debate on what constitutes common good in efforts to combat homophobia and heterosexism. A publicized outing targets prominent figures in a society, for example well-known politicians, accomplished athletes or popular artists. Opponents to LGBT rights movements as well as activists within LGBT communities have used this type of outing as a controversial political campaign or tactic. In an attempt to pre-empt being outed, an LGBT public figure may decide to come out publicly first, although controlling the conditions under which one's LGBT identity is revealed is only one of numerous motives for coming out.\n\nIt is hard to pinpoint the first use of outing in the modern sense. In a 1982 issue of \"Harper's\", Taylor Branch predicted that \"outage\" would become a political tactic in which the closeted would find themselves trapped in a crossfire. The article \"Forcing Gays Out of the Closet\" by William A. Henry III in \"Time\" (January 29, 1990) introduced the term \"outing\" to the general public.\n\nWhile the term is recent, the practice goes back much further. Outing was a common put-down of Greek and Roman orators. Before the Christian era, sodomy was not illegal in Greek or, most believe, in Roman law, between adult citizens, but homosexual acts between citizens were considered acceptable only under certain social circumstances. Both Romans and Greeks sneeringly deemed vulgar the persons engaged in those acts.\n\nThe Harden–Eulenburg affair of 1907–1909 was the first public outing scandal of the twentieth century. Left-wing journalists opposed to Kaiser Wilhelm II's policies outed a number of prominent members of his cabinet and inner circle —and by implication the Kaiser —beginning with Maximilian Harden's indictment of the aristocratic diplomat Prince Eulenburg. Harden's accusations incited other journalists to follow suit, including Adolf Brand, founder of \"Der Eigene\".\n\nLeft-wing journalists outed Adolf Hitler's closest ally Ernst Röhm in the early 1930s, causing Brand to write, \"when someone —as teacher, priest, representative, or statesman —would like to set in the most damaging way the intimate love contacts of others under degrading control —in that moment his own love-life also ceases to be a private matter and forfeits every claim to remain protected hence-forward from public scrutiny and suspicious oversight.\"\n\nIn the 1950s, tabloid publications like \"Confidential\" appeared, specializing in the revelation of scandalous information about entertainment and political celebrities. Among the political figures targeted by the magazine were former Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles and Arthur H. Vandenberg, Jr., who had briefly served as President Eisenhower's Appointments Secretary.\n\nOuting may be found to be libel by a court of law. For example, in 1957 American pianist Liberace, successfully sued the \"Daily Mirror\" for merely insinuating that he was gay. The \"Daily Mirror\"s defence was that the words complained of, in a column written by William Connor under his byline 'Cassandra', did not imply that Liberace was gay. The paper did not attempt to prove that the accusation was true: it attempted to prove that no accusation had been made. Following Liberace's death from an AIDS-related illness in 1987, the paper asked for the award to be refunded.\nAfter the Stonewall riots of 1969, swells of gay-libbers came out aggressively in the 1970s, crying out: \"Out of the closets, Into the streets!\" Some began to demand that all homosexuals come out, and that if they weren't willing to do so, then it was the community's responsibility to do it for them. One example is the outing of Oliver Sipple, who saved the life of United States President Gerald Ford during an assassination attempt. Stipple was outed by gay activists, most prominently Harvey Milk. The negative impact the outing had on Sipple's life later provoked opposition. Some argued that privacy should prevail, and felt it was better for the movement to protect closeted gays, especially in homophobic religious institutions and the military. Despite their best efforts, many gays and lesbians were still unwilling to come out.\n\nSome political conservatives opposed to increased public acceptance of homosexuality engaged in outing in this period as well, with the goal of embarrassing or discrediting their ideological foes. Conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, for example, published the letters of gay fellow students at Dartmouth College in the campus newspaper he edited (\"The Dartmouth Review\") in 1981; a few years later, succeeding \"Review\" editor Laura Ingraham had a meeting of a campus gay organization secretly tape-recorded, then published a transcript as part of an editorial denouncing the group as \"cheerleaders for latent campus sodomites.\"\n\nIn the 1980s, the AIDS pandemic led to the outing of several major entertainers, including Rock Hudson.\n\nOne of the first outings by an activist in the United States occurred in February 1989. Michael Petrelis, along with a few others, alleged that Mark Hatfield, a Republican Senator from Oregon was gay. They did this because he supported legislation initiated by Jesse Helms. At a fundraiser in a small town outside of Portland, the group stood up and outed him in front of the crowd. Petrelis later tried to make news by standing on the U.S. Capitol steps and reading the names of \"twelve men and women in politics and music who ... are secretly gay.\" Though the press showed up, no major news organization published the story. (Gross, p. 85) Potential libel suits deterred publishers.\n\n\"OutWeek\", which had begun publishing in 1989, was home to activist and outing pioneer Michelangelo Signorile, who stirred the waters when he outed the recently deceased Malcolm Forbes in March 1990. His column \"Gossip Watch\" became a hot spot for outing the rich and famous. Both praised and lambasted for his behavior, he garnered responses to his actions as wide-ranging as \"one of the greater contemporary gay heroes,\" to \"revolting, infantile, cheap name-calling.\"\n\nOther people who have been outed include Fannie Flagg, Pete Williams, Chaz Bono, and Richard Chamberlain.\n\nIn 2004, gay rights activist Michael Rogers outed Edward Schrock, a Republican Congressman from Virginia. Rogers posted a story on his website alleging that Schrock used an interactive phone sex service to meet other men for sex. Schrock did not deny this, and announced on August 30, 2004, that he would not seek re-election. Rogers said that he outed Schrock to punish him for his hypocrisy in voting for the Marriage Protection Act and signing on as a co-sponsor of the Federal Marriage Amendment.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey announced that he was a \"gay American\" in August 2004. McGreevey had become aware that he was about to be named in a sexual harassment suit by Golan Cipel, his former security advisor, with whom it was alleged McGreevey had a sexual relationship. McGreevey resigned, but unlike Schrock, McGreevey decided not to step out of public life. John McCain's Presidential Campaign removed images of Alabama Attorney General Troy King from its website after he was outed in 2008.\n\nOften outing is used solely to damage the outed person's reputation, and has thus been controversial. Some activists, such as United States Congressman Barney Frank argue that outing is appropriate and legitimate in some cases — for example, if the individual is actively working against LGBT rights. Frank clarified, during the 2006 Mark Foley scandal, \"I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves.\"\n\nIn 2009, Kirby Dick's documentary \"Outrage\" argued that several American political figures have led closeted gay lives while supporting and endorsing legislation that is harmful to the gay community. The film was based on the work of Michael Rogers and BlogActive.com. The film focused particular attention on Idaho Senator Larry Craig, an outspoken opponent of gay rights who in 2007 pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for soliciting sex from an undercover police officer in a public bathroom. \"Outrage\" featured interviews with several people who claim that Governor of Florida Charlie Crist has led a private gay life while publicly opposing gay marriage and gay adoption.\n\nOther politicians discussed in the film include former Virginia Representative Ed Schrock, California Representative David Dreier, former New York City mayor Ed Koch, and former Louisiana Representative Jim McCrery.\n\nThe film argues that the mass media is reluctant to discuss issues involving gay politicians despite the many comparable news stories about heterosexual politicians and scandals. \"Outrage\" describes this behavior as a form of institutionalized homophobia that has resulted in a tacit policy of self-censorship when reporting on these issues.\n\nGabriel Rotello, once editor of \"OutWeek\", called outing \"equalizing\", explaining, \"what we have called 'outing' is a primarily journalistic movement to treat homosexuality as equal to heterosexuality in the media...In 1990, many of us in the gay media announced that henceforth we would simply treat homosexuality and heterosexuality as equals. We were not going to wait for the perfect, utopian future to arrive before equalizing the two: We were going to do it now. That's what outing really is: equalizing homosexuality and heterosexuality in the media.\" (\"Why I Oppose Outing\", \"OutWeek\", May 29, 1991)\n\nTheir aim is not only to reveal the hypocrisy of those in what Branch termed the \"closets of power\" but also a gay person awareness of the presence of gay people and political issues, thus showing that being gay and lesbian is not \"so utterly grotesque that it should never be discussed.\" (Signorile, p. 78) Richard Mohr noted, \"some people have compared outing to McCarthyism...And vindictive outing is like McCarthyism: such outing feeds gays to the wolves, who thereby are made stronger...But the sort of outing I have advocated does not invoke, mobilize, or ritualistically confirm anti-gay values; rather it cuts against them, works to undo them. The point of outing, as I have defended it, is not to wreak vengeance, not to punish, and not to deflect attention from one's own debased state. Its point is to avoid degrading oneself.\" Thus outing is \"both permissible and an expected consequence of living morally.\"\n\nFurther, outing is not the airing of private details. As Signorile asked, \"How can being gay be private when being straight isn't? Sex is private. But by outing we do not discuss anyone's sex life. We only say they're gay.\" \"Average people have been outed for decades. People have always outed the mailman and the milkman and the spinster who lives down the block. If anything, the goal behind outing is to show just how many gay people there are among the most visible people in our society so that when someone outs the milkman or the spinster, everyone will say, 'So what?'\"\n\nThere is no widely agreed definition of fair outing nor even clear consensus in most organizations on when it can occur. Virtually all who take a position on outing have qualified the limits to which it is permissible for one to go - often quite idiosyncratic. The extremes are to out no one or to out everyone. In between, four intermediate positions have been discerned to justify so-called fair outing:\n\n\nAssessing to which degree the outer goes allows insight into the goal striven towards. Most outers target those who support decisions and further policy, both religious and secular, which discriminate against gay people while they themselves live a clandestine gay existence. A \"truism to people active in the gay movement [is] that the greatest impediments to homosexuals' progress often [are] not heterosexuals, but closeted homosexuals,\" said San Francisco journalist Randy Shilts.\n\nThe effectiveness of outing as a political tactic depends on the willingness of the media to report that a person has been outed. The advent of the internet has made outing public figures much easier. Twenty years ago Michael Rogers would have had to persuade a newspaper or other media outlet to risk legal action by reporting his allegations about Congressman Ed Schrock. Today he can publish them himself on his website and other media will then report that he has done so.\n\nSignorile argues that the outing of journalist Pete Williams \"and its aftermath did indeed make a big dent in the military's policy against gays. The publicity generated put the policy on the front burner in 1992, thrusting the issue into the presidential campaign,\" with every Democratic candidate and independent Ross Perot publicly promising to end the ban. (ibid, p. 161).\n\nThe military forces of the world have differing approaches to the enlistment of heterosexual, asexual, and bisexual individuals. Some have open policies, others prohibit, and some are ambiguous. The armed forces of most developed countries have now removed policies excluding non-heterosexual individuals (with strict policies on sexual harassment).\n\nNations that permit gay people to serve openly in the military include the 4 of the 5 members of the UN Security Council (United States, United Kingdom, France, and Russia), the Republic of China (Taiwan), Australia, Israel, Argentina, and all NATO members except Turkey.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the Ministry of Defence policy since the year 2000 is to allow homosexual men, lesbians and transgender personnel to serve openly, and discrimination on a sexual orientation basis is forbidden. It is also forbidden for someone to pressure LGBT people to come out.\n\nIn the United States LGBT people are allowed to serve openly in the United States military. Military policy and legislation had previously entirely prohibited gay individuals from serving, and subsequently from serving openly, but these prohibitions were ended in September 2011 after the United States Congress voted to repeal the policy. The first time homosexuals were differentiated from non-homosexuals in the military literature was in revised army mobilization regulations in 1942. Additional policy revisions in 1944 and 1947 further codified the ban. Throughout the next few decades, homosexuals were routinely discharged, regardless of whether they had engaged in sexual conduct while serving. In response to the gay rights movements of the 1970s and 1980s, the Department of Defense issued a 1982 policy (DOD Directive 1332.14) stating that homosexuality was clearly incompatible with military service. Controversy over this policy created political pressure to amend the policy, with socially liberal efforts seeking a repeal of the ban and socially conservative groups wishing to reinforce it by statute.\n\nSome gay rights activists defend outing as a tactic. The British activist Peter Tatchell says \"The lesbian and gay community has a right to defend itself against public figures who abuse their power and influence to support policies which inflict suffering on homosexuals.\" In 1994 Tatchell's activist group OutRage! alleged that fourteen bishops of the Church of England were homosexual or bisexual and named them, accusing them of hypocrisy for upholding the Church's policy of regarding homosexual acts as sinful while not observing this prohibition in their personal lives.\n\"Outing is queer self-defence,\" Tatchell says. \"Lesbians and gay men have a right, and a duty, to expose hypocrites and homophobes. By not outing gay Bishops who support policies which harm homosexuals, we would be protecting those Bishops and thereby allowing them to continue to inflict suffering on members of our community. Collusion with hypocrisy and homophobia is not ethically defensible for Christians, or for anyone else.\"\n\nSome gay activists, however, continue to disapprove of outing as a political tactic, arguing that even anti-gay conservatives have a right to personal privacy which should be respected. Steven Fisher, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, the largest advocacy group for gay and lesbian issues in the United States, commenting on the Schrock outing, said he opposed using \"sexual orientation as a weapon.\" Christopher R. Barron, political director of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group representing gay and lesbian Republicans said: \"We disagree strongly with the outing campaign, but we also strongly disagree with President Bush's sponsorship of the anti-family Federal Marriage Amendment.\"\n\nRoger Rosenblatt argued in his January 1993 \"New York Times Magazine\" essay \"Who Killed Privacy?\" that, \"The practice of 'outing' homosexuals implies contradictorily that homosexuals have a right to private choice but not to private lives.\" In March 2002, singer Will Young revealed he was gay, pre-empting a tabloid newspaper (reportedly \"News of the World\") that was preparing to out him.\n\nOther criticism concerning outing centers upon the harm that outing individuals as homosexual, transgender, or transsexual does to them personally and professionally and upon the fact that some individuals have been erroneously outed or have been outed when there is no proof to substantiate the claim that they are gay or transgender.\n\nChristine Jorgensen, Beth Elliott, Renée Richards, Sandy Stone, Billy Tipton, Alan L. Hart, April Ashley, Caroline Cossey (\"Tula\"), Jahna Steele, and Nancy Jean Burkholder were outed as transsexuals by European or American media or, in the case of Billy Tipton, by his coroner. In many cases, being outed had an adverse effect on their personal lives and their careers.\n\nIn some cases well-known celebrities have been outed as transgender or intersex when no proof to substantiate the claims was presented, e.g., Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nOuting has been featured in comedy films as well, such as the French comedy \"Le Placard\" (\"The Closet\"), where a heterosexual man is falsely outed, or in the 1997 comedy \"In & Out\" where Kevin Kline stars as a small-town teacher who gets outed on national television, and is then forced to come to terms with his own unrecognized homosexuality.\n\nIn Season 5 the television series \"The L Word\", the issue of public outing is addressed in the form of Alice Pieszecki, a web-journalist, outing a basketball player who made offensive comments toward gay people while himself being gay. She also ambiguously outs lesbian actress Niki Stevens while guest-hosting a fictional talk show called \"The Look\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23529", "title": "Proverb", "text": "Proverb\n\nA proverb (from ) is a simple, concrete, traditional saying that expresses a truth based on common sense or experience. Proverbs are often metaphorical and use formulaic language. Collectively, they form a genre of folklore.\n\nSome proverbs exist in more than one language because people borrow them from languages and cultures similar to theirs. In the West, the Bible (including, but not limited to the Book of Proverbs) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of Erasmus) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs. Not all Biblical proverbs, however, were distributed to the same extent: one scholar has gathered evidence to show that cultures in which the Bible is the \"major spiritual book contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible,\" whereas another shows that, of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, eleven are from the Bible. However, almost every culture has its own unique proverbs.\n\nWhat is a proverb? Lord John Russell (c. 1850) observed poetically that a \"proverb is the wit of one, and the wisdom of many.\" But giving the word \"proverb\" the sort of definition theorists need has proven to be a difficult task, and although scholars often quote Archer Taylor's argument that formulating a scientific \"definition of a proverb is too difficult to repay the undertaking... An incommunicable quality tells us this sentence is proverbial and that one is not. Hence no definition will enable us to identify positively a sentence as proverbial,\" many students of proverbs have attempted to itemize its essential characteristics. \n\nMore constructively, Mieder has proposed the following definition, \"A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed, and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation\". Norrick created a table of distinctive features to distinguish proverbs from idioms, cliches, etc. Prahlad distinguishes proverbs from some other, closely related types of sayings, \"True proverbs must further be distinguished from other types of proverbial speech, e.g. proverbial phrases, Wellerisms, maxims, quotations, and proverbial comparisons.\" Based on Persian proverbs, Zolfaghari and Ameri propose the following definition: \"A proverb is a short sentence, which is well-known and at times rhythmic, including advice, sage themes and ethnic experiences, comprising simile, metaphor or irony which is well-known among people for its fluent wording, clarity of expression, simplicity, expansiveness and generality and is used either with or without change\".\n\nThere are many sayings in English that are commonly referred to as \"proverbs\", such as weather sayings. Alan Dundes, however, rejects including such sayings among truly proverbs: \"Are weather proverbs proverbs? I would say emphatically 'No!'\" The definition of \"proverb\" has also changed over the years. For example, the following was labeled \"A Yorkshire proverb\" in 1883, but would not be categorized as a proverb by most today, \"as throng as Throp's wife when she hanged herself with a dish-cloth\". The changing of the definition of \"proverb\" is also noted in Turkish.\n\nIn other languages and cultures, the definition of \"proverb\" also differs from English. In the Chumburung language of Ghana, \"\"aŋase\" are literal proverbs and \"akpare\" are metaphoric ones\". Among the Bini of Nigeria, there are three words that are used to translate \"proverb\": \"ere, ivbe\", and \"itan\". The first relates to historical events, the second relates to current events, and the third was \"linguistic ornamentation in formal discourse\". Among the Balochi of Pakistan and Afghanistan, there is a word \"batal\" for ordinary proverbs and \"bassīttuks\" for \"proverbs with background stories\".\n\nThere are also language communities that combine proverbs and riddles in some sayings, leading some scholars to create the label \"proverb riddles\".\n\n\nProverbs come from a variety of sources. Some are, indeed, the result of people pondering and crafting language, such as some by Confucius, Plato, Baltasar Gracián, etc. Others are taken from such diverse sources as poetry, stories, songs, commercials, advertisements, movies, literature, etc. A number of the well known sayings of Jesus, Shakespeare, and others have become proverbs, though they were original at the time of their creation, and many of these sayings were not seen as proverbs when they were first coined. Many proverbs are also based on stories, often the end of a story. For example, the proverb \"Who will bell the cat?\" is from the end of a story about the mice planning how to be safe from the cat.\n\nSome authors have created proverbs in their writings, such a J.R.R. Tolkien, and some of these proverbs have made their way into broader society, such as the bumper sticker pictured below. Similarly, C.S. Lewis' created proverb about a lobster in a pot, from the \"Chronicles of Narnia\", has also gained currency. In cases like this, deliberately created proverbs for fictional societies have become proverbs in real societies. In a fictional story set in a real society, the movie \"Forrest Gump\" introduced \"Life is like a box of chocolates\" into broad society. In at least one case, at appears that a proverb deliberately created by one writer has been naively picked up and used by another who assumed it to be an established Chinese proverb, Ford Madox Ford having picked up a proverb from Ernest Bramah, \"It would be hypocrisy to seek for the person of the Sacred Emperor in a Low Tea House.\"\n\nThe proverb with \"a longer history than any other recorded proverb in the world\", going back to \"around 1800 BC\" is in a Sumerian clay tablet, \"The bitch by her acting too hastily brought forth the blind\". Though many proverbs are ancient, they were all newly created at some point by somebody. Sometimes it is easy to detect that a proverb is newly coined by a reference to something recent, such as the Haitian proverb \"The fish that is being microwaved doesn't fear the lightning\". Similarly, there is a recent Maltese proverb, \"wil-muturi, ferh u duluri\" \"Women and motorcycles are joys and griefs\"; the proverb is clearly new, but still formed as a traditional style couplet with rhyme. Also, there is a proverb in the Kafa language of Ethiopia that refers to the forced military conscription of the 1980s, \"...the one who hid himself lived to have children.\" A Mongolian proverb also shows evidence of recent origin, \"A beggar who sits on gold; Foam rubber piled on edge.\" A political candidate in Kenya popularised a new proverb in his 1995 campaign, \"Chuth ber\" \"Immediacy is best\". \"The proverb has since been used in other contexts to prompt quick action.\" Over 1,400 new English proverbs are said to have been coined and gained currency in the 20th century. This process of creating proverbs is always ongoing, so that possible new proverbs are being created constantly. Those sayings that are adopted and used by an adequate number of people become proverbs in that society.\n\nInterpreting proverbs is often complex, but is best done in a context. Interpreting proverbs from other cultures is much more difficult than interpreting proverbs in one's own culture. Even within English-speaking cultures, there is difference of opinion on how to interpret the proverb \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\" Some see it as condemning a person that keeps moving, seeing moss as a positive thing, such as profit; others see the proverb as praising people that keep moving and developing, seeing moss as a negative thing, such as negative habits.\n\nSimilarly, among Tajik speakers, the proverb \"One hand cannot clap\" has two significantly different interpretations. Most see the proverb as promoting teamwork. Others understand it to mean that an argument requires two people. In an extreme example, one researcher working in Ghana found that for a single Akan proverb, twelve different interpretations were given. Children will sometimes interpret proverbs in a literal sense, not yet knowing how to understand the conventionalized metaphor. Interpretation of proverbs is also affected by injuries and diseases of the brain, \"A hallmark of schizophrenia is impaired proverb interpretation.\"\n\nProverbs in various languages are found with a wide variety of grammatical structures. In English, for example, we find the following structures (in addition to others):\n\nHowever, people will often quote only a fraction of a proverb to invoke an entire proverb, e.g. \"All is fair\" instead of \"All is fair in love and war\", and \"A rolling stone\" for \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\"\n\nThe grammar of proverbs is not always the typical grammar of the spoken language, often elements are moved around, to achieve rhyme or focus.\n\nAnother type of grammatical structure in proverbs is a short dialogue:\n\nBecause many proverbs are both poetic and traditional, they are often passed down in fixed forms. Though spoken language may change, many proverbs are often preserved in conservative, even archaic, form. In English, for example, \"betwixt\" is not used by many, but a form of it is still heard (or read) in the proverb \"There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.\" The conservative form preserves the meter and the rhyme. This conservative nature of proverbs can result in archaic words and grammatical structures being preserved in individual proverbs, as has been documented in Amharic, Greek, Nsenga, and Polish.\n\nIn addition, proverbs may still be used in languages which were once more widely known in a society, but are now no longer so widely known. For example, English speakers use some non-English proverbs that are drawn from languages that used to be widely understood by the educated class, e.g. \"C'est la vie\" from French and \"Carpe diem\" from Latin. \n\nProverbs are often handed down through generations. Therefore, \"many proverbs refer to old measurements, obscure professions, outdated weapons, unknown plants, animals, names, and various other traditional matters.\"\nTherefore, it is common that they preserve words that become less common and archaic in broader society. Proverbs in solid form -- such as murals, carvings, and glass -- can be viewed even after the language of their form is no longer widely understood, such as an Anglo-French proverb in a stained glass window in York.\n\nProverbs are often and easily translated and transferred from one language into another. \"There is nothing so uncertain as the derivation of proverbs, the same proverb being often found in all nations, and it is impossible to assign its paternity.\"\n\nProverbs are often borrowed across lines of language, religion, and even time. For example, a proverb of the approximate form \"No flies enter a mouth that is shut\" is currently found in Spain, France, Ethiopia, and many countries in between. It is embraced as a true local proverb in many places and should not be excluded in any collection of proverbs because it is shared by the neighbors. However, though it has gone through multiple languages and millennia, the proverb can be traced back to an ancient Babylonian proverb (Pritchard 1958:146). Another example of a widely spread proverb is \"A drowning person clutches at [frogs] foam\", found in Peshai of Afghanistan and Orma of Kenya, and presumably places in between.\n\nProverbs about one hand clapping are common across Asia, from Dari in Afghanistan to Japan. Some studies have been done devoted to the spread of proverbs in certain regions, such as India and her neighbors and Europe. An extreme example of the borrowing and spread of proverbs was the work done to create a corpus of proverbs for Esperanto, where all the proverbs were translated from other languages.\n\nIt is often not possible to trace the direction of borrowing a proverb between languages. This is complicated by the fact that the borrowing may have been through plural languages. In some cases, it is possible to make a strong case for discerning the direction of the borrowing based on an artistic form of the proverb in one language, but a prosaic form in another language. For example, in Ethiopia there is a proverb \"Of mothers and water, there is none evil.\" It is found in Amharic, Alaaba language, and Oromo, three languages of Ethiopia:\nThe Oromo version uses poetic features, such as the initial \"ha\" in both clauses with the final \"-aa\" in the same word, and both clauses ending with \"-an\". Also, both clauses are built with the vowel \"a\" in the first and last words, but the vowel \"i\" in the one syllable central word. In contrast, the Amharic and Alaaba versions of the proverb show little evidence of sound-based art.\n\nHowever, not all languages have proverbs. Proverbs are (nearly) universal across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some languages in the Pacific have them, such as Maori. Other Pacific languages do not, e.g. \"there are no proverbs in Kilivila\" of the Trobriand Islands. However, in the New World, there are almost no proverbs: \"While proverbs abound in the thousands in most cultures of the world, it remains a riddle why the Native Americans have hardly any proverb tradition at all.\" Hakamies has examined the matter of whether proverbs are found universally, a universal genre, concluding that they are not. \n\nProverbs are used in conversation by adults more than children, partially because adults have learned more proverbs than children. Also, using proverbs well is a skill that is developed over years. Additionally, children have not mastered the patterns of metaphorical expression that are invoked in proverb use. Proverbs, because they are indirect, allow a speaker to disagree or give advice in a way that may be less offensive. Studying actual proverb use in conversation, however, is difficult since the researcher must wait for proverbs to happen. An Ethiopian researcher, Tadesse Jaleta Jirata, made headway in such research by attending and taking notes at events where he knew proverbs were expected to be part of the conversations.\n\nMany authors have used proverbs in their writings, for a very wide variety of literary genres: epics, novels, poems, short stories.\n\nProbably the most famous user of proverbs in novels is J. R. R. Tolkien in his \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" series. Herman Melville is noted for creating proverbs in Moby Dick and in his poetry. Also, C. S. Lewis created a dozen proverbs in \"The Horse and His Boy\", and Mercedes Lackey created dozens for her invented Shin'a'in and Tale'edras cultures; Lackey's proverbs are notable in that they are reminiscent to those of Ancient Asia - e.g. \"Just because you feel certain an enemy is lurking behind every bush, it doesn't follow that you are wrong\" is like to \"Before telling secrets on the road, look in the bushes.\" These authors are notable for not only using proverbs as integral to the development of the characters and the story line, but also for creating proverbs.\n\nAmong medieval literary texts, Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde plays a special role because Chaucer's usage seems to challenge the truth value of proverbs by exposing their epistemological unreliability. Rabelais used proverbs to write an entire chapter of Gargantua.\n\nThe patterns of using proverbs in literature can change over time. A study of \"classical Chinese novels\" found proverb use as frequently as one proverb every 3,500 words in \"Water Margin\" (\"Sui-hu chuan\") and one proverb every 4,000 words in \"Wen Jou-hsiang\". But modern Chinese novels have fewer proverbs by far.\nProverbs (or portions of them) have been the inspiration for titles of books: \"The Bigger they Come\" by Erle Stanley Gardner, and \"Birds of a Feather\" (several books with this title), \"Devil in the Details\" (multiple books with this title). Sometimes a title alludes to a proverb, but does not actually quote much of it, such as \"The Gift Horse's Mouth\" by Robert Campbell. Some books or stories have titles that are twisted proverbs, anti-proverbs, such as \"No use dying over spilled milk\", \"When life gives you lululemons,\" and two books titled \"Blessed are the Cheesemakers\". The twisted proveb of last title was also used in the Monty Python movie Life of Brian, where a person mishears one of Jesus Christ's beatitudes, \"I think it was 'Blessed are the cheesemakers.'\"\n\nSome books and stories are built around a proverb. Some of Tolkien's books have been analyzed as having \"governing proverbs\" where \"the acton of a book turns on or fulfills a proverbial saying.\" Some stories have been written with a proverb overtly as an opening, such as \"A stitch in time saves nine\" at the beginning of \"Kitty's Class Day\", one of Louisa May Alcott's \"Proverb Stories\". Other times, a proverb appears at the end of a story, summing up a moral to the story, frequently found in Aesop's Fables, such as \"Heaven helps those who help themselves\" from \"Hercules and the Wagoner\".\n\nProverbs have also been used strategically by poets. Sometimes proverbs (or portions of them or anti-proverbs) are used for titles, such as \"A bird in the bush\" by Lord Kennet and his stepson Peter Scott and \"The blind leading the blind\" by Lisa Mueller. Sometimes, multiple proverbs are important parts of poems, such as Paul Muldoon's \"Symposium\", which begins \"You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it hold its nose to the grindstone and hunt with the hounds. Every dog has a stitch in time...\" The Turkish poet Refiki wrote an entire poem by stringing proverbs together, which has been translated into English poetically yielding such verses as \"Be watchful and be wary, / But seldom grant a boon; / The man who calls the piper / Will also call the tune.\"\n\nBecause proverbs are familiar and often pointed, they have been used by a number of hip-hop poets. This has been true not only in the USA, birthplace of hip-hop, but also in Nigeria. Since Nigeria is so multilingual, hip-hop poets there use proverbs from various languages, mixing them in as it fits their need, sometimes translating the original. For example,\n\"They forget say ogbon ju agbaralo\nThey forget that wisdom is greater than power\"\n\nSome authors have bent and twisted proverbs, creating anti-proverbs, for a variety of literary effects. For example, in the Harry Potter novels, J. K. Rowling reshapes a standard English proverb into \"It's no good crying over spilt potion\" and Dumbledore\nadvises Harry not to \"count your owls before they are delivered\". In a slightly different use of reshaping proverbs, in the Aubrey–Maturin series of historical naval novels by Patrick O'Brian, Capt. Jack Aubrey humorously mangles and mis-splices proverbs, such as \"Never count the bear's skin before it is hatched\" and \"There's a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot.\" Earlier than O'Brian's Aubrey, Beatrice Grimshaw also used repeated splicings of proverbs in the mouth of an eccentric marquis to create a memorable character in \"The Sorcerer's Stone\", such as \"The proof of the pudding sweeps clean\" (p. 109) and \"A stitch in time is as good as a mile\" (p. 97).\n\nBecause proverbs are so much a part of the language and culture, authors have sometimes used proverbs in historical fiction effectively, but anachronistically, before the proverb was actually known. For example, the novel \"Ramage and the Rebels\", by Dudley Pope is set in approximately 1800. Captain Ramage reminds his adversary \"You are supposed to know that it is dangerous to change horses in midstream\" (p. 259), with another allusion to the same proverb three pages later. However, the proverb about changing horses in midstream is reliably dated to 1864, so the proverb could not have been known or used by a character from that period.\n\nSome authors have used so many proverbs that there have been entire books written cataloging their proverb usage, such as Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie, George Bernard Shaw, Cervantes, and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nOn the non-fiction side, proverbs have also been used by authors for articles that have no connection to the study of proverbs. Some have been used as the basis for book titles, e.g. \"I Shop, Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self\" by April Lane Benson. Some proverbs been used as the basis for article titles, though often in altered form: \"All our eggs in a broken basket: How the Human Terrain System is undermining sustainable military cultural competence\" and \"Should Rolling Stones Worry About Gathering Moss?\", \"Between a Rock and a Soft Place\". Proverbs have been noted as common in subtitles of articles such as \"Discontinued intergenerational transmission of Czech in Texas: 'Hindsight is better than foresight'.\" Also, the reverse is found with a proverb (complete or partial) as the title, then an explanatory subtitle, \"To Change or Not to Change Horses: The World War II Elections\". Many authors have cited proverbs as epigrams at the beginning of their articles, e.g. \"'If you want to dismantle a hedge, remove one thorn at a time' Somali proverb\" in an article on peacemaking in Somalia. An article about research among the Māori used a Māori proverb as a title, then began the article with the Māori form of the proverb as an epigram \"Set the overgrown bush alight and the new flax shoots will spring up\", followed by three paragraphs about how the proverb served as a metaphor for the research and the present context. A British proverb has even been used as the title for a doctoral dissertation: \"Where there is muck there is brass\".\n\nSimilarly to other forms of literature, proverbs have also been used as important units of language in drama and films. This is true from the days of classical Greek works to old French to Shakespeare, to 19th Century Spanish, to today. The use of proverbs in drama and film today is still found in languages around the world, such as Yorùbá.\n\nA film that makes rich use of proverbs is \"Forrest Gump\", known for both using and creating proverbs. Other studies of the use of proverbs in film include work by Kevin McKenna on the Russian film \"Aleksandr Nevsky\", Haase's study of an adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood, Elias Dominguez Barajas on the film \"Viva Zapata!\", and Aboneh Ashagrie on \"The Athlete\" (a movie in Amharic about Abebe Bikila).\n\nIn the case of \"Forrest Gump\", the screenplay by Eric Roth had more proverbs than the novel by Winston Groom, but for \"The Harder They Come\", the reverse is true, where the novel derived from the movie by Michael Thelwell has many more proverbs than the movie.\n\nÉric Rohmer, the French film director, directed a series of films, the \"Comedies and Proverbs\", where each film was based on a proverb: \"The Aviator's Wife\", \"The Perfect Marriage\", \"Pauline at the Beach\", \"Full Moon in Paris\" (the film's proverb was invented by Rohmer himself: \"The one who has two wives loses his soul, the one who has two houses loses his mind.\"), \"The Green Ray\", \"Boyfriends and Girlfriends\".\n\nMovie titles based on proverbs include \"Murder Will Out (1939 film)\", \"Try, Try Again\", and \"The Harder They Fall\". A twisted anti-proverb was the title for a Three Stooges film, \"A Bird in the Head\". The title of an award-winning Turkish film, Three Monkeys, also invokes a proverb, though the title does not fully quote it.\n\nThey have also been used as the titles of plays: \"Baby with the Bathwater\" by Christopher Durang, \"Dog Eat Dog\" by Mary Gallagher, and \"The Dog in the Manger\" by Charles Hale Hoyt. The use of proverbs as titles for plays is not, of course, limited to English plays: \"Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermée\" (A door must be open or closed) by Paul de Musset. Proverbs have also been used in musical dramas, such as \"The Full Monty\", which has been shown to use proverbs in clever ways. In \"Beauty and the Beast\", Gaston plays with three proverbs in sequence, \"All roads lead to.../The best things in life are.../All's well that ends with me.\"\n\nProverbs are often poetic in and of themselves, making them ideally suited for adapting into songs. Proverbs have been used in music from opera to country to hip-hop. Proverbs have also been used in music in other languages, such as the Akan language the Igede language, and Spanish. \n\nIn English the proverb (or rather the beginning of the proverb), If the shoe fits has been used as a title for three albums and five songs. Other English examples of using proverbs in music include Elvis Presley's \"Easy come, easy go\", Harold Robe's \"Never swap horses when you're crossing a stream\", Arthur Gillespie's \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder\", Bob Dylan's \"Like a rolling stone\", Cher's \"Apples don't fall far from the tree\". Lynn Anderson made famous a song full of proverbs, \"I never promised you a rose garden\" (written by Joe South). In choral music, we find Michael Torke's \"Proverbs\" for female voice and ensemble. A number of Blues musicians have also used proverbs extensively. The frequent use of proverbs in Country music has led to published studies of proverbs in this genre. The Reggae artist Jahdan Blakkamoore has recorded a piece titled \"Proverbs Remix\". The opera \"Maldobrìe\" contains careful use of proverbs. An extreme example of many proverbs used in composing songs is a song consisting almost entirely of proverbs performed by Bruce Springsteen, \"My best was never good enough\". The Mighty Diamonds recorded a song called simply \"Proverbs\".\n\nThe band Fleet Foxes used the proverb painting Netherlandish Proverbs for the cover of their eponymous album Fleet Foxes.\n\nIn addition to proverbs being used in songs themselves, some rock bands have used parts of proverbs as their names, such as the Rolling Stones, Bad Company, The Mothers of Invention, Feast or Famine, Of Mice and Men. There have been at least two groups that called themselves \"The Proverbs\", and there is a hip-hop performer in South Africa known as \"Proverb\". In addition, many albums have been named with allusions to proverbs, such as \"Spilt milk\" (a title used by Jellyfish and also Kristina Train), \"The more things change\" by Machine Head, \"Silk purse\" by Linda Ronstadt, \"Another day, another dollar\" by DJ Scream Roccett, \"The blind leading the naked\" by Violent Femmes, \"What's good for the goose is good for the gander\" by Bobby Rush, \"Resistance is Futile\" by Steve Coleman, \"Murder will out\" by Fan the Fury. The proverb \"Feast or famine\" has been used as an album title by Chuck Ragan, Reef the Lost Cauze, Indiginus, and DaVinci. Whitehorse mixed two proverbs for the name of their album \"Leave no bridge unburned\". The band Splinter Group released an album titled \"When in Rome, Eat Lions\". The band Downcount used a proverb for the name of their tour, \"Come and take it\".\n\nFrom ancient times, people around the world have recorded proverbs in visual form. This has been done in two ways. First, proverbs have been \"written\" to be displayed, often in a decorative manner, such as on pottery, cross-stitch, murals, kangas (East African women's wraps), quilts, a stained glass window, and graffiti.\n\nSecondly, proverbs have often been visually depicted in a variety of media, including paintings, etchings, and sculpture. Jakob Jordaens painted a plaque with a proverb about drunkenness above a drunk man wearing a crown, titled \"The King Drinks\". Probably the most famous examples of depicting proverbs are the different versions of the paintings \"Netherlandish Proverbs\" by the father and son Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Pieter Brueghel the Younger, the proverbial meanings of these paintings being the subject of a 2004 conference, which led to a published volume of studies (Mieder 2004a). The same father and son also painted versions of The Blind Leading the Blind, a Biblical proverb. These and similar paintings inspired another famous painting depicting some proverbs and also idioms (leading to a series of additional paintings), such as \"Proverbidioms\" by T. E. Breitenbach. Another painting inspired by Bruegel's work is by the Chinese artist, Ah To, who created a painting illustrating 81 Cantonese sayings. Corey Barksdale has produced a book of paintings with specific proverbs and pithy quotations. The British artist Chris Gollon has painted a major work entitled \"Big Fish Eat Little Fish\", a title echoing Bruegel's painting Big Fishes Eat Little Fishes.\n\nSometimes well-known proverbs are pictured on objects, without a text actually quoting the proverb, such as the three wise monkeys who remind us \"Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil\". When the proverb is well known, viewers are able to recognize the proverb and understand the image appropriately, but if viewers do not recognize the proverb, much of the effect of the image is lost. For example, there is a Japanese painting in the Bonsai museum in Saitama city that depicted flowers on a dead tree, but only when the curator learned the ancient (and no longer current) proverb \"Flowers on a dead tree\" did the curator understand the deeper meaning of the painting.\n\nA study of school students found that students remembered proverbs better when there were visual representations of proverbs along with the verbal form of the proverbs.\n\nA bibliography on proverbs in visual form has been prepared by Mieder and Sobieski (1999). Interpreting visual images of proverbs is subjective, but familiarity with the depicted proverb helps.\n\nSome artists have used proverbs and anti-proverbs for titles of their paintings, alluding to a proverb rather than picturing it. For example, Vivienne LeWitt painted a piece titled \"If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?\", which shows neither foot nor shoe, but a woman counting her money as she contemplates different options when buying vegetables.\n\nIn 2018, 13 sculptures depicting Maltese proverbs were installed in open spaces of downtown Valletta.\n\nCartoonists, both editorial and pure humorists, have often used proverbs, sometimes primarily building on the text, sometimes primarily on the situation visually, the best cartoons combining both. Not surprisingly, cartoonists often twist proverbs, such as visually depicting a proverb literally or twisting the text as an anti-proverb. An example with all of these traits is a cartoon showing a waitress delivering two plates with worms on them, telling the customers, \"Two early bird specials... here ya go.\"\n\nThe traditional Three wise monkeys were depicted in Bizarro with different labels. Instead of the negative imperatives, the one with ears covered bore the sign \"See and speak evil\", the one with eyes covered bore the sign \"See and hear evil\", etc. The caption at the bottom read \"The power of positive thinking.\" Another cartoon showed a customer in a pharmacy telling a pharmacist, \"I'll have an ounce of prevention.\" The comic strip The Argyle Sweater showed an Egyptian archeologist loading a mummy on the roof of a vehicle, refusing the offer of a rope to tie it on, with the caption \"A fool and his mummy are soon parted.\" The comic One Big Happy showed a conversation where one person repeatedly posed part of various proverb and the other tried to complete each one, resulting in such humorous results as \"Don't change horses... unless you can lift those heavy diapers.\"\n\nEditorial cartoons can use proverbs to make their points with extra force as they can invoke the wisdom of society, not just the opinion of the editors. In an example that invoked a proverb only visually, when a US government agency (GSA) was caught spending money extravagantly, a cartoon showed a black pot labeled \"Congress\" telling a black kettle labeled \"GSA\", \"Stop wasting the taxpayers' money!\" It may have taken some readers a moment of pondering to understand it, but the impact of the message was the stronger for it.\n\nCartoons with proverbs are so common that Wolfgang Mieder has published a collected volume of them, many of them editorial cartoons. For example, a German editorial cartoon linked a current politician to the Nazis, showing him with a bottle of swastika-labeled wine and the caption \"In vino veritas\".\n\nOne cartoonist very self-consciously drew and wrote cartoons based on proverbs for the University of Vermont student newspaper \"The Water Tower\", under the title \"Proverb place\".\n\nProverbs are frequently used in advertising, often in slightly modified form.\nFord once advertised its Thunderbird with, \"One drive is worth a thousand words\" (Mieder 2004b: 84). This is doubly interesting since the underlying proverb behind this, \"One picture is worth a thousand words,\" was originally introduced into the English proverb repertoire in an ad for televisions (Mieder 2004b: 83).\n\nA few of the many proverbs adapted and used in advertising include:\n\nThe GEICO company has created a series of television ads that are built around proverbs, such as \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\", and \"The pen is mightier than the sword\", \"Pigs may fly/When pigs fly\", \"If a tree falls in the forest...\", and \"Words can never hurt you\". Doritos made a commercial based on the proverb, \"When pigs fly.\" Many advertisements that use proverbs shorten or amend them, such as, \"Think outside the shoebox.\" \nUse of proverbs in advertising is not limited to the English language. Seda Başer Çoban has studied the use of proverbs in Turkish advertising. Tatira has given a number of examples of proverbs used in advertising in Zimbabwe. However, unlike the examples given above in English, all of which are anti-proverbs, Tatira's examples are standard proverbs. Where the English proverbs above are meant to make a potential customer smile, in one of the Zimbabwean examples \"both the content of the proverb and the fact that it is phrased as a proverb secure the idea of a secure time-honored relationship between the company and the individuals\". When newer buses were imported, owners of older buses compensated by painting a traditional proverb on the sides of their buses, \"Going fast does not assure safe arrival\".\n\nThere are often proverbs that contradict each other, such as \"Look before you leap\" and \"He who hesitates is lost\", or \"Many hands make light work\" and \"Too many cooks spoil the broth\". These have been labeled \"counter proverbs\" or \"antonymous proverbs\". When there are such counter proverbs, each can be used in its own appropriate situation, and neither is intended to be a universal truth.\n\nThe concept of \"counter proverb\" is more about pairs of contradictory proverbs than about the use of proverbs to counter each other in an argument. For example, from the Tafi language of Ghana, the following pair of proverbs are counter to each other but are each used in appropriate contexts, \"A co-wife who is too powerful for you, you address her as your mother\" and \"Do not call your mother's co-wife your mother...\" In Nepali, there is a set of totally contradictory proverbs: \"Religion is victorious and sin erodes\" and \"Religion erodes and sin is victorious\".\nAlso, the following pair are counter proverbs from the Kasena of Ghana: \"It is the patient person who will milk a barren cow\" and \"The person who would milk a barren cow must prepare for a kick on the forehead\". The two contradict each other, whether they are used in an argument or not (though indeed they were used in an argument). But the same work contains an appendix with many examples of proverbs used in arguing for contrary positions, but proverbs that are not inherently contradictory, such as \"One is better off with hope of a cow's return than news of its death\" countered by \"If you don't know a goat [before its death] you mock at its skin\". Though this pair was used in a contradictory way in a conversation, they are not a set of \"counter proverbs\".\n\nDiscussing counter proverbs in the Badaga language, Hockings explained that in his large collection \"a few proverbs are mutually contradictory... we can be sure that the Badagas do not see the matter that way, and would explain such apparent contradictions by reasoning that proverb \"x\" is used in one context, while \"y\" is used in quite another.\" Comparing Korean proverbs, \"when you compare two proverbs, often they will be contradictory.\" They are used for \"a particular situation\".\n\n\"Counter proverbs\" are not the same as a \"paradoxical proverb\", a proverb that contains a seeming paradox.\n\nIn many cultures, proverbs are so important and so prominent that there are proverbs about proverbs, that is, \"metaproverbs\". The most famous one is from Yoruba of Nigeria, \"Proverbs are the horses of speech, if communication is lost we use proverbs to find it,\" used by Wole Soyinka in \"Death and the King's Horsemen\". In Mieder's bibliography of proverb studies, there are twelve publications listed as describing metaproverbs. Other metaproverbs include:\n\nThere is a growing interest in deliberately using proverbs to achieve goals, usually to support and promote changes in society. On the negative side, this was deliberately done by the Nazis. On the more positive side, proverbs have also been used for constructive purposes. For example, proverbs have been used for teaching foreign languages at various levels. In addition, proverbs have been used for public health promotion, such as promoting breast feeding with a shawl bearing a Swahili proverb \"Mother's milk is sweet\". Proverbs have also been applied for helping people manage diabetes, to combat prostitution, and for community development., to resolve conflicts, and to slow the transmission of HIV.\n\nThe most active field deliberately using proverbs is Christian ministry, where Joseph G. Healey and others have deliberately worked to catalyze the collection of proverbs from smaller languages and the application of them in a wide variety of church-related ministries, resulting in publications of collections and applications. This attention to proverbs by those in Christian ministries is not new, many pioneering proverb collections having been collected and published by Christian workers.\n\nU.S. Navy Captain Edward Zellem pioneered the use of Afghan proverbs as a positive relationship-building tool during the war in Afghanistan, and in 2012 he published two bilingual collections of Afghan proverbs in Dari and English, part of an effort of nationbuilding, followed by a volume of Pashto proverbs in 2014.\n\nThere is a longstanding debate among proverb scholars as to whether the cultural values of specific language communities are reflected (to varying degree) in their proverbs. Many claim that the proverbs of a particular culture reflect the values of that specific culture, at least to some degree. Many writers have asserted that the proverbs of their cultures reflect their culture and values; this can be seen in such titles as the following: \"An introduction to Kasena society and culture through their proverbs\", Prejudice, power, and poverty in Haiti: a study of a nation's culture as seen through its proverbs, Proverbiality and worldview in Maltese and Arabic proverbs, Fatalistic traits in Finnish proverbs, \"Vietnamese cultural patterns and values as expressed in proverbs\", \"The Wisdom and Philosophy of the Gikuyu proverbs: The Kihooto worldview\", \"Spanish Grammar and Culture through Proverbs,\" and \"How Russian Proverbs Present the Russian National Character\". Kohistani has written a thesis to show how understanding Afghan Dari proverbs will help Europeans understand Afghan culture.\n\nHowever, a number of scholars argue that such claims are not valid. They have used a variety of arguments. Grauberg argues that since many proverbs are so widely circulated they are reflections of broad human experience, not any one culture's unique viewpoint. Related to this line of argument, from a collection of 199 American proverbs, Jente showed that only 10 were coined in the USA, so that most of these proverbs would not reflect uniquely American values. Giving another line of reasoning that proverbs should not be trusted as a simplistic guide to cultural values, Mieder once observed \"proverbs come and go, that is, antiquated proverbs with messages and images we no longer relate to are dropped from our proverb repertoire, while new proverbs are created to reflect the mores and values of our time\", so old proverbs still in circulation might reflect past values of a culture more than its current values. Also, within any language's proverb repertoire, there may be \"counter proverbs\", proverbs that contradict each other on the surface (see section above). When examining such counter proverbs, it is difficult to discern an underlying cultural value. With so many barriers to a simple calculation of values directly from proverbs, some feel \"one cannot draw conclusions about values of speakers simply from the texts of proverbs\".\n\nMany outsiders have studied proverbs to discern and understand cultural values and world view of cultural communities. These outsider scholars are confident that they have gained insights into the local cultures by studying proverbs, but this is not universally accepted. \nSeeking empirical evidence to evaluate the question of whether proverbs reflect a culture's values, some have counted the proverbs that support various values. For example, Moon lists what he sees as the top ten core cultural values of the Builsa society of Ghana, as exemplified by proverbs. He found that 18% of the proverbs he analyzed supported the value of being a member of the community, rather than being independent. This was corroboration to other evidence that collective community membership is an important value among the Builsa. In studying Tajik proverbs, Bell notes that the proverbs in his corpus \"Consistently illustrate Tajik values\" and \"The most often observed proverbs reflect the focal and specific values\" discerned in the thesis.\n\nA study of English proverbs created since 1900 showed in the 1960s a sudden and significant increase in proverbs that reflected more casual attitudes toward sex. Since the 1960s was also the decade of the Sexual revolution, this shows a strong statistical link between the changed values of the decades and a change in the proverbs coined and used. Another study mining the same volume counted Anglo-American proverbs about religion to show that proverbs indicate attitudes toward religion are going downhill.\n\nThere are many examples where cultural values have been explained and illustrated by proverbs. For example, from India, the concept that birth determines one's nature \"is illustrated in the oft-repeated proverb: there can be no friendship between grass-eaters and meat-eaters, between a food and its eater\". Proverbs have been used to explain and illustrate the Fulani cultural value of \"pulaaku\". But using proverbs to \"illustrate\" a cultural value is not the same as using a collection of proverbs to \"discern\" cultural values. In a comparative study between Spanish and Jordanian proverbs it is defined the social imagination for the mother as an archetype in the context of role transformation and in contrast with the roles of husband, son and brother, in two societies which might be occasionally associated with sexist and /or rural ideologies.\n\nSome scholars have adopted a cautious approach, acknowledging at least a genuine, though limited, link between cultural values and proverbs: \"The cultural portrait painted by proverbs may be fragmented, contradictory, or otherwise at variance with reality... but must be regarded not as accurate renderings but rather as tantalizing shadows of the culture which spawned them.\" There is not yet agreement on the issue of whether, and how much, cultural values are reflected in a culture's proverbs.\n\nIt is clear that the Soviet Union believed that proverbs had a direct link to the values of a culture, as they used them to try to create changes in the values of cultures within their sphere of domination. Sometimes they took old Russian proverbs and altered them into socialist forms. These new proverbs promoted Socialism and its attendant values, such as atheism and collectivism, e.g. \"Bread is given to us not by Christ, but by machines and collective farms\" and \"A good harvest is had only by a collective farm.\" They did not limit their efforts to Russian, but also produced \"newly coined proverbs that conformed to socialist thought\" in Tajik and other languages of the USSR.\nMany proverbs from around the world address matters of ethics and expected of behavior. Therefore, it is not surprising that proverbs are often important texts in religions. The most obvious example is the Book of Proverbs in the Bible. Additional proverbs have also been coined to support religious values, such as the following from Dari of Afghanistan: \"In childhood you're playful, In youth you're lustful, In old age you're feeble, So when will you before God be worshipful?\"\n\nClearly proverbs in religion are not limited to monotheists; among the Badaga of India (Sahivite Hindus), there is a traditional proverb \"Catch hold of and join with the man who has placed sacred ash [on himself].\" Proverbs are widely associated with large religions that draw from sacred books, but they are also used for religious purposes among groups with their own traditional religions, such as the Guji Oromo. The broadest comparative study of proverbs across religions is \"The eleven religions and their proverbial lore, a comparative study. A reference book to the eleven surviving major religions of the world\" by Selwyn Gurney Champion, from 1945. Some sayings from sacred books also become proverbs, even if they were not obviously proverbs in the original passage of the sacred book. For example, many quote \"Be sure your sin will find you out\" as a proverb from the Bible, but there is no evidence it was proverbial in its original usage (Numbers 32:23).\n\nNot all religious references in proverbs are positive, some are cynical, such as the Tajik, \"Do as the mullah says, not as he does.\" Also, note the Italian proverb, \"One barrel of wine can work more miracles than a church full of saints\". An Indian proverb is cynical about devotees of Hinduism, \"[Only] When in distress, a man calls on Rama\". In the context of Tibetan Buddhism, some Ladakhi proverbs mock the lamas, e.g. \"If the lama's own head does not come out cleanly, how will he do the drawing upwards of the dead?... used for deriding the immoral life of the lamas.\" Proverbs do not have to explicitly mention religion or religious figures to be used to mock a religion, seen in the fact that in a collection of 555 proverbs from the Lur, a Muslim group in Iran, the explanations for 15 of them use illustrations that mock Muslim clerics.\n\nDammann thought \"The influence of Islam manifests itself in African proverbs... Christian influences, on the contrary, are rare.\" If widely true in Africa, this is likely due to the longer presence of Islam in many parts of Africa. Reflection of Christian values is common in Amharic proverbs of Ethiopia, an area that has had a presence of Christianity for well over 1,000 years. The Islamic proverbial reproduction may also be shown in the image of some animals such as the dog. Although dog is portrayed in many European proverbs as the most faithful friend of man, it is represented in some Islamic countries as impure, dirty, vile, cowardly, ungrateful and treacherous, in addition to links to negative human superstitions such as loneliness, indifference and bad luck.\n\nThough much proverb scholarship is done by literary scholars, those studying the human mind have used proverbs in a variety of studies. One of the earliest studies in this field is the \"Proverbs Test\" by Gorham, developed in 1956. A similar test is being prepared in German. Proverbs have been used to evaluate dementia, study the cognitive development of children, measure the results of brain injuries, and study how the mind processes figurative language.\n\nThe study of proverbs is called paremiology which has a variety of uses in the study of such topics as philosophy, linguistics, and folklore. There are several types and styles of proverbs which are analyzed within Paremiology as is the use and misuse of familiar expressions which are not strictly 'proverbial' in the dictionary definition of being fixed sentences\n\nGrigorii Permjakov developed the concept of the core set of proverbs that full members of society know, what he called the \"paremiological minimum\" (1979). For example, an adult American is expected to be familiar with \"Birds of a feather flock together\", part of the American paremiological minimum. However, an average adult American is not expected to know \"Fair in the cradle, foul in the saddle\", an old English proverb that is not part of the current American paremiological minimum. Thinking more widely than merely proverbs, Permjakov observed \"every adult Russian language speaker (over 20 years of age) knows no fewer than 800 proverbs, proverbial expressions, popular literary quotations and other forms of cliches\". Studies of the paremiological minimum have been done for a limited number of languages, including Russian, Hungarian, Czech, Somali, Nepali, Gujarati, Spanish, Esperanto, Polish, Ukrainian. Two noted examples of attempts to establish a paremiological minimum in America are by Haas (2008) and Hirsch, Kett, and Trefil (1988), the latter more prescriptive than descriptive. There is not yet a recognized standard method for calculating the paremiological minimum, as seen by comparing the various efforts to establish the paremiological minimum in a number of languages.\n\nA seminal work in the study of proverbs is Archer Taylor's \"The Proverb\" (1931), later republished by Wolfgang Mieder with Taylor's Index included (1985/1934). A good introduction to the study of proverbs is Mieder's 2004 volume, \"Proverbs: A Handbook\". Mieder has also published a series of bibliography volumes on proverb research, as well as a large number of articles and other books in the field. Stan Nussbaum has edited a large collection on proverbs of Africa, published on a CD, including reprints of out-of-print collections, original collections, and works on analysis, bibliography, and application of proverbs to Christian ministry (1998). Paczolay has compared proverbs across Europe and published a collection of similar proverbs in 55 languages (1997). Mieder edits an academic journal of proverb study, \"Proverbium\" (), many back issues of which are available online. A volume containing articles on a wide variety of topics touching on proverbs was edited by Mieder and Alan Dundes (1994/1981). \"Paremia\" is a Spanish-language journal on proverbs, with articles available online. There are also papers on proverbs published in conference proceedings volumes from the annual Interdisciplinary Colloquium on Proverbs in Tavira, Portugal. Mieder has published a two-volume \"International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology\", with a topical, language, and author index. Mieder has published a bibliography of collections of proverbs from around the world. A broad introduction to proverb study, \"Introduction to Paremiology\", edited by Hrisztalina Hrisztova-Gotthardt and Melita Aleksa Varga has been published in both hardcover and free open access, with articles by a dozen different authors.\n\nThe study of proverbs has been built by a number of notable scholars and contributors. Earlier scholars were more concerned with collecting than analyzing. Desiderius Erasmus was a Latin scholar (1466 – 1536), whose collection of Latin proverbs, known as \"Adagia\", spread Latin proverbs across Europe. Juan de Mal Lara was a 16th century Spanish scholar, one of his books being 1568 \"Philosophia vulgar\", the first part of which contains one thousand and one sayings.\n\nFrom the 20th century onwards, proverb scholars were involved in not only collecting proverbs, but also analyzing and comparing proverbs. Alan Dundes was a 20th century American folklorist whose scholarly output on proverbs led Wolfgang Mieder to refer to him as a “pioneering paremiologist”. Matti Kuusi was a 20th century Finnish paremiologist, the creator of the Matti Kuusi international type system of proverbs. With encouragement from Archer Taylor, he founded the journal \"Proverbium: Bulletin d'Information sur les Recherches Parémiologiques\", published from 1965 to 1975 by the Society for Finnish Literature, which was later restarted as \"Proverbium: International Yearbook of Proverb Scholarship\". Archer Taylor was a 20th century American scholar, best known for his \"magisterial\" book \"The Proverb\". Dimitrios Loukatos was a 20th century Greek proverb scholar, author of such works as \"Aetiological Tales of Modern Greek Proverbs\". Arvo Krikmann (1939 – 2017) was an Estonian proverb scholar, whom Wolfgang Mieder called “one of the leading paremiologists in the world” and “master folklorist and paremiologist”. Elisabeth Piirainen was a German scholar with 50 proverb-related publications. \n\nCurrent proverb scholars have continued the trend to be involved in analysis as well as collection of proverbs. Claude Buridant is a century French scholar whose work has concentrated on Romance languages. Galit Hasan-Rokem is an Israeli scholar, associate editor of \"Proverbium: The yearbook of international proverb scholarship\", since 1984. She has written on proverbs in Jewish traditions. Joseph G. Healey is an American Catholic missionary in Kenya who has led a movement to sponsor African proverb scholars to collect proverbs from their own language communities. This led Wolfgang Mieder to dedicate the \"International Bibliography of New and Reprinted Proverb Collections\" section of \"Proverbium\" 32 to Healey. Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett is a scholar of Jewish history and folklore, including proverbs. Wolfgang Mieder is a German-born proverb scholar who has worked his entire academic career in the USA. He is the editor of ‘’Proverbium’’ and the author of the two volume \"International Bibliography of Paremiology and Phraseology\". He has been honored by three festschrift publications. He has also been recognized by biographical publications that focused on his scholarship. Dora Sakayan is a scholar who has written about German and Armenian studies, including \"Armenian Proverbs: A Paremiological Study with an Anthology of 2,500 Armenian Folk Sayings Selected and Translated into English\". An extensive introduction addresses the language and structure, as well as the origin of Armenian proverbs (international, borrowed and specifically Armenian proverbs). Mineke Schipper is a Dutch scholar, best known for her book \"Never Marry a Woman with Big Feet - Women in Proverbs from Around the World\".. Edward Zellem is an American proverb scholar who has edited books of Afghan proverbs, developed a method of collecting proverbs via the Web.\n\n\n\nSerious websites related to the study of proverbs, and some that list regional proverbs:\n"}

However, regardless of these borrowings, its grammar and vocabulary are still largely German.\n\nAlthough Riograndenser Hunsrückisch is the most common German dialect in south Brazil, the use of this language—particularly in the last three to four generations—continues to decrease.\n\nRecent Roman Catholic papal candidate Odilo Scherer of Cerro Largo, located in the northwest of Rio Grande do Sul, like many from his native region grew up with this language, side-by-side with Portuguese, the national language. \n\nRoman Catholic Cardinal Cláudio Hummes of Montenegro, Rio Grande do Sul (in the \"Altkolonie\" region of the state), grew up speaking Portuguese together with this regional variety of German.\n\nAccording to the famous world model Gisele Bündchen her parents and siblings still speak this Brazilian regional variety of German, although, also according to her, she has forgotten everything herself.\n\nDuring an interview in 2011, renowned Brazilian writer, translator and international relations professor Aldyr Schlee talked in detail about having been an eyewitness to the repression of the German language in his native state of Rio Grande do Sul during World War II.\n\nOrthography between plain angle brackets follows Wiesemann's orthography and between italic angle brackets follows Altenhofen et al.'s orthography.\n\nThe contrast between plosives is not of voice, but of articulatory force, a phenomenon observed in some other dialects of German.\n\nChapter 23, 1–5 of Luke's Gospel in Riograndenser Hunsrückisch, according to Dr. Ursula Wiesemann's orthography:\n\n\"Yeesus un Pilatos\"\n\n\"23 Too sin ti kanse layt uf kextii, hon Yeesus pis Pilatos kenom un hon aan kefang aan se këwe un saare: 2 Mëyer hon too te man aan ketrof unser folek am uf hëtse.

Er antwortete ihm und sprach: Du sagst es! 4 Da sprach Pilatus zu den obersten Priestern und der Volksmenge: Ich finde keine Schuld an diesem Menschen! 5 Sie aber bestanden darauf und sprachen: Er wiegelt das Volk auf, indem er in ganz Judäa lehrt, angefangen in Galiläa bis hierher!\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26756", "title": "Sino-Tibetan languages", "text": "Sino-Tibetan languages\n\nThe Sino-Tibetan languages, in a few sources also known as Trans-Himalayan, are a family of more than 400 languages spoken in East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia. The family is second only to Indo-European in terms of the number of native speakers. The Sino-Tibetan languages with the most native speakers are the varieties of Chinese (1.3 billion), Burmese (33 million), and the Tibetic languages (6 million), but many Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by small communities in remote mountain areas and as such are poorly documented. Unlike Western linguists, Chinese linguists generally include Kra–Dai and Hmong-Mien languages within Sino-Tibetan.\n\nSeveral low-level subgroups have been securely reconstructed, but reconstruction of a proto-language for the family as a whole is still at an early stage, so the higher-level structure of Sino-Tibetan remains unclear. Although the family is traditionally presented as divided into Sinitic (i.e. Chinese) and Tibeto-Burman branches, a common origin of the non-Sinitic languages has never been demonstrated.\nSeveral links to other language families have been proposed, but none has broad acceptance.\n\nA genetic relationship between Chinese, Tibetan, Burmese and other languages was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted. The initial focus on languages of civilizations with long literary traditions has been broadened to include less widely spoken languages, some of which have only recently, or never, been written. However, the reconstruction of the family is much less developed than for families such as Indo-European or Austroasiatic. Difficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of inflection in many of them, and the effects of language contact. In addition, many of the smaller languages are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to access, and are often also sensitive border zones.\n\nDuring the 18th century, several scholars had noticed parallels between Tibetan and Burmese, both languages with extensive literary traditions.\nEarly in the following century, Brian Houghton Hodgson and others noted that many non-literary languages of the highlands of northeast India and Southeast Asia were also related to these.\nThe name \"Tibeto-Burman\" was first applied to this group in 1856 by James Richardson Logan, who added Karen in 1858.\nThe third volume of the \"Linguistic Survey of India\", edited by Sten Konow, was devoted to the Tibeto-Burman languages of British India.\n\nStudies of the \"Indo-Chinese\" languages of Southeast Asia from the mid-19th century by Logan and others revealed that they comprised four families: Tibeto-Burman, Tai, Mon–Khmer and Malayo-Polynesian.\nJulius Klaproth had noted in 1823 that Burmese, Tibetan and Chinese all shared common basic vocabulary but that Thai, Mon, and Vietnamese were quite different.\nErnst Kuhn envisaged a group with two branches, Chinese-Siamese and Tibeto-Burman.\nAugust Conrady called this group Indo-Chinese in his influential 1896 classification, though he had doubts about Karen. Conrady's terminology was widely used, but there was uncertainty regarding his exclusion of Vietnamese. Franz Nikolaus Finck in 1909 placed Karen as a third branch of Chinese-Siamese.\n\nJean Przyluski introduced the French term \"sino-tibétain\" as the title of his chapter on the group in Meillet and Cohen's \"Les langues du monde\" in 1924. He divided them into three groups: Tibeto-Burman, Chinese and Tai, and was uncertain about the affinity of Karen and Hmong–Mien. The English translation \"Sino-Tibetan\" first appeared in a short note by Przyluski and Luce in 1931.\n\nIn 1935, the anthropologist Alfred Kroeber started the Sino-Tibetan Philology Project, funded by the Works Project Administration and based at the University of California, Berkeley.\nThe project was supervised by Robert Shafer until late 1938, and then by Paul K. Benedict.\nUnder their direction, the staff of 30 non-linguists collated all the available documentation of Sino-Tibetan languages.\nThe result was eight copies of a 15-volume typescript entitled \"Sino-Tibetan Linguistics\".\nThis work was never published, but furnished the data for a series of papers by Shafer, as well as Shafer's five-volume \"Introduction to Sino-Tibetan\" and Benedict's \"Sino-Tibetan, a Conspectus\".\n\nBenedict completed the manuscript of his work in 1941, but it was not published until 1972. Instead of building the entire family tree, he set out to reconstruct a Proto-Tibeto-Burman language by comparing five major languages, with occasional comparisons with other languages. He reconstructed a two-way distinction on initial consonants based on voicing, with aspiration conditioned by pre-initial consonants that had been retained in Tibetic but lost in many other languages. Thus, Benedict reconstructed the following initials:\n\nAlthough the initial consonants of cognates tend to have the same place and manner of articulation, voicing and aspiration is often unpredictable.\nThis irregularity was attacked by Roy Andrew Miller, though Benedict's supporters attribute it to the effects of prefixes that have been lost and are often unrecoverable.\nThe issue remains unsolved today.\nIt was cited together with the lack of reconstructable shared morphology, and evidence that much shared lexical material has been borrowed from Chinese into Tibeto-Burman, by Christopher Beckwith, one of the few scholars still arguing that Chinese is not related to Tibeto-Burman.\n\nOld Chinese is by far the oldest recorded Sino-Tibetan language, with inscriptions dating from 1200 BC and a huge body of literature from the first millennium BC, but the Chinese script is not alphabetic. Scholars have sought to reconstruct the phonology of Old Chinese by comparing the obscure descriptions of the sounds of Middle Chinese in medieval dictionaries with phonetic elements in Chinese characters and the rhyming patterns of early poetry. The first complete reconstruction, the \"Grammata Serica Recensa\" of Bernard Karlgren, was used by Benedict and Shafer.\n\nKarlgren's reconstruction was somewhat unwieldy, with many sounds having a highly non-uniform distribution. Later scholars have revised it by drawing on a range of other sources. Some proposals were based on cognates in other Sino-Tibetan languages, though workers have also found solely Chinese evidence for them. For example, recent reconstructions of Old Chinese have reduced Karlgren's 15 vowels to a six-vowel system originally suggested by Nicholas Bodman. Similarly, Karlgren's *l has been recast as *r, with a different initial interpreted as *l, matching Tibeto-Burman cognates, but also supported by Chinese transcriptions of foreign names. A growing number of scholars believe that Old Chinese did not use tones, and that the tones of Middle Chinese developed from final consonants. One of these, *-s, is believed to be a suffix, with cognates in other Sino-Tibetan languages.\nTibetic has extensive written records from the adoption of writing by the Tibetan Empire in the mid-7th century. The earliest records of Burmese (such as the 12th-century Myazedi inscription) are more limited, but later an extensive literature developed. Both languages are recorded in alphabetic scripts ultimately derived from the Brahmi script of Ancient India. Most comparative work has used the conservative written forms of these languages, following the dictionaries of Jäschke (Tibetan) and Judson (Burmese), though both contain entries from a wide range of periods.\n\nThere are also extensive records in Tangut, the language of the Western Xia (1038–1227). Tangut is recorded in a Chinese-inspired logographic script, whose interpretation presents many difficulties, even though multilingual dictionaries have been found.\n\nGong Hwang-cherng has compared Old Chinese, Tibetic, Burmese and Tangut in an effort to establish sound correspondences between those languages. He found that Tibetic and Burmese correspond to two Old Chinese vowels, *a and *ə. While this has been considered evidence for a separate Tibeto-Burman subgroup, Hill (2014) finds that Burmese has distinct correspondences for Old Chinese rhymes \"-ay\" : *-aj and \"-i\" : *-əj, and hence argues that the development *ə > *a occurred independently in Tibetan and Burmese.\n\nThe descriptions of non-literary languages used by Shafer and Benedict were often produced by missionaries and colonial administrators of varying linguistic skill.\nMost of the smaller Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken in inaccessible mountainous areas, many of which are politically or militarily sensitive and thus closed to investigators.\nUntil the 1980s, the best-studied areas were Nepal and northern Thailand.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, new surveys were published from the Himalayas and southwestern China.\nOf particular interest was the discovery of a new branch of the family, the Qiangic languages of western Sichuan and adjacent areas.\n\nMost of the current spread of Sino-Tibetan languages is the result of historical expansions of the three groups with the most speakers – Chinese, Burmese and Tibetic – replacing an unknown number of earlier languages.\nThese groups also have the longest literary traditions of the family.\nThe remaining languages are spoken in mountainous areas, along the southern slopes of the Himalayas, the Southeast Asian Massif and the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nBy far the largest group are the 1.3 billion speakers of varieties of Chinese, most of whom live in the eastern half of China.\nThe first records of Chinese are oracle bone inscriptions from c. 1200 BC, when Old Chinese was spoken around the middle reaches of the Yellow River.\nChinese has since expanded throughout China, forming a family whose diversity has been compared with the Romance languages.\nDiversity is greater in the rugged terrain of southeast China than in the North China Plain.\n\nBurmese is the national language of Myanmar, and the first language of some 33 million people.\nBurmese speakers first entered the northern Irrawaddy basin from what is now western Yunnan in the early 9th century, when the Pyu city-states had been weakened by an invasion by Nanzhao.\nOther Burmish languages are still spoken in Dehong Prefecture in the far west of Yunnan.\nBy the 11th century their Pagan Kingdom had expanded over the whole basin.\nThe oldest texts, such as the Myazedi inscription, date from the early 12th century.\n\nThe Tibetic languages are spoken by some 6 million people on the Tibetan Plateau and neighbouring areas in the Himalayas and western Sichuan.\nThey are descended from Old Tibetan, which was originally spoken in the Yarlung Valley before it was spread by the expansion of the Tibetan Empire in the 7th century.\nAlthough the empire collapsed in the 9th century, Classical Tibetan remained influential as the liturgical language of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThe remaining languages are spoken in upland areas.\nSouthernmost are the Karen languages, spoken by 4 million people in the hill country along the Myanmar–Thailand border, with the greatest diversity in the Karen Hills, which are believed to be the homeland of the group.\nThe highlands stretching from northeast India to northern Myanmar contain over 100 high-diverse Sino-Tibetan languages.\nOther Sino-Tibetan languages are found along the southern slopes of the Himalayas, southwest China and northern Thailand.\n\nThere have been a range of proposals for the Sino-Tibetan urheimat, reflecting the uncertainty about the classification of the family and its time depth.\nJames Matisoff (1991) places it in the eastern part of the Tibetan plateau around 4000 BC, with the various groups migrating out down the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween and Brahmaputra rivers.\nGeorge van Driem (2005) proposes that Sino-Tibetan originated in the Sichuan Basin before 7000 BC, with an early migration into northeast India, and a later migration north of the predecessors of Chinese and Tibetic. Roger Blench and Mark Post (2014) have proposed that the Sino-Tibetan homeland is northeast India, the area of greatest diversity, around 7000 BC.\nRoger Blench (2009) argues that agriculture cannot be reconstructed for Proto-Sino-Tibetan, and that the earliest speakers of Sino-Tibetan were not farmers but highly diverse foragers.\n\nSeveral low-level branches of the family, particularly Lolo-Burmese, have been securely reconstructed, but in the absence of a secure reconstruction of a Sino-Tibetan proto-language, the higher-level structure of the family remains unclear.\nThus, a conservative classification of Sino-Tibetan/Tibeto-Burman would posit several dozen small coordinate families and isolates; attempts at subgrouping are either geographic conveniences or hypotheses for further research.\n\nIn a survey in the 1937 \"Chinese Yearbook\", Li Fang-Kuei described the family as consisting of four branches:\n\nTai and Miao–Yao were included because they shared isolating typology, tone systems and some vocabulary with Chinese. At the time, tone was considered so fundamental to language that tonal typology could be used as the basis for classification. In the Western scholarly community, these languages are no longer included in Sino-Tibetan, with the similarities attributed to diffusion across the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, especially since .\nThe exclusions of Vietnamese by Kuhn and of Tai and Miao–Yao by Benedict were vindicated in 1954 when André-Georges Haudricourt demonstrated that the tones of Vietnamese were reflexes of final consonants from Proto-Mon–Khmer.\n\nMany Chinese linguists continue to follow Li's classification. However, this arrangement remains problematic. For example, there is disagreement over whether to include the entire Kra–Dai family or just Kam–Tai (Zhuang–Dong excludes the Kra languages), because the Chinese cognates that form the basis of the putative relationship are not found in all branches of the family and have not been reconstructed for the family as a whole. In addition, Kam–Tai itself no longer appears to be a valid node within Kra–Dai.\n\nBenedict overtly excluded Vietnamese (placing it in Mon–Khmer) as well as Hmong–Mien and Kra–Dai (placing them in Austro-Tai).\nHe otherwise retained the outlines of Conrady's Indo-Chinese classification, though putting Karen in an intermediate position:\n\nShafer criticized the division of the family into Tibeto-Burman and Sino-Daic branches, which he attributed to the different groups of languages studied by Konow and other scholars in British India on the one hand and by Henri Maspero and other French linguists on the other.\nHe proposed a detailed classification, with six top-level divisions:\n\nShafer was sceptical of the inclusion of Daic, but after meeting Maspero in Paris decided to retain it pending a definitive resolution of the question.\n\nJames Matisoff abandoned Benedict's Tibeto-Karen hypothesis:\n\nSome more-recent Western scholars, such as Bradley (1997) and La Polla (2003), have retained Matisoff's two primary branches, though differing in the details of Tibeto-Burman. However, Jacques (2006) notes, \"comparative work has never been able to put forth evidence for common innovations to all the Tibeto-Burman languages (the Sino-Tibetan languages to the exclusion of Chinese)\" and that \"it no longer seems justified to treat Chinese as the first branching of the Sino-Tibetan family,\" because the morphological divide between Chinese and Tibeto-Burman has been bridged by recent reconstructions of Old Chinese.\n\nThe internal structure of Sino-Tibetan has been tentatively revised as the following Stammbaum by Matisoff (2015: xxxii, 1123-1127) in the final print release of the \"Sino-Tibetan Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus\" (STEDT). Matisoff (2015: xxxi) acknowledges that the position of Chinese as either a sister branch of Tibeto-Burman or a branch within Tibeto-Burman remains an open question.\n\n\nSergei Starostin proposed that both the Kiranti languages and Chinese are divergent from a \"core\" Tibeto-Burman of at least Bodish, Lolo-Burmese, Tamangic, Jinghpaw, Kukish, and Karen (other families were not analysed) in a hypothesis called \"Sino-Kiranti\". The proposal takes two forms: that Sinitic and Kiranti are themselves a valid node or that the two are not demonstrably close, so that Sino-Tibetan has three primary branches:\n\nvan Driem, like Shafer, rejects a primary split between Chinese and the rest, suggesting that Chinese owes its traditional privileged place in Sino-Tibetan to historical, typological, and cultural, rather than linguistic, criteria. He calls the entire family \"Tibeto-Burman\", a name he says has historical primacy, but other linguists who reject a privileged position for Chinese nevertheless continue to call the resulting family \"Sino-Tibetan\", including Roger Blench.\n\nLike Matisoff, van Driem acknowledges that the relationships of the \"Kuki–Naga\" languages (Kuki, Mizo, Meitei, etc.), both amongst each other and to the other languages of the family, remain unclear. However, rather than placing them in a geographic grouping, as Matisoff does, van Driem leaves them unclassified.\nHe has proposed several hypotheses, including the reclassification of Chinese to a Sino-Bodic subgroup:\n\nVan Driem points to two main pieces of evidence establishing a special relationship between Sinitic and Bodic and thus placing Chinese within the Tibeto-Burman family. First, there are a number of parallels between the morphology of Old Chinese and the modern Bodic languages. Second, there is an impressive body of lexical cognates between the Chinese and Bodic languages, represented by the Kirantic language Limbu.\n\nIn response, Matisoff notes that the existence of shared lexical material only serves to establish an absolute relationship between two language families, not their relative relationship to one another. Although some cognate sets presented by van Driem are confined to Chinese and Bodic, many others are found in Sino-Tibetan languages generally and thus do not serve as evidence for a special relationship between Chinese and Bodic.\n\nGeorge van Driem (2001) has also proposed a \"fallen leaves\" model that lists dozens of well-established low-level groups while remaining agnostic about intermediate groupings of these.\nIn the most recent version (van Driem 2014), 42 groups are identified (with individual languages highlighted in \"italics\"):\nvan Driem (2007) also suggested that the Sino-Tibetan language family be renamed \"Trans-Himalayan\", which he considers to be more neutral.\n\nRoger Blench and Mark W. Post have criticized the applicability of conventional Sino-Tibetan classification schemes to minor languages lacking an extensive written history (unlike Chinese, Tibetic, and Burmese). They find that the evidence for the subclassification or even ST affiliation at all of several minor languages of northeastern India, in particular, is either poor or absent altogether.\n\nIn their view, many such languages would for now be best considered unclassified, or \"internal isolates\" within the family. They propose a provisional classification of the remaining languages:\nFollowing that, because they propose that the three best-known branches may actually be much closer related to each other than they are to \"minor\" Sino-Tibetan languages, Blench and Post argue that \"Sino-Tibetan\" or \"Tibeto-Burman\" are inappropriate names for a family whose earliest divergences led to different languages altogether. They support the proposed name \"Trans-Himalayan\".\n\nThe phenomenon of drift, proposed by American linguist Edward Sapir, occurred in many languages and dialects in the Sino-Tibetan family. Proto-Chinese and Proto-Tibeto-Burman are both agglutinative languages. The change in Proto-Chinese to Old Chinese around the Shang Dynasty could be found in the Book of songs when the classifications of the noun, verbs, and modifier were all dependent on affixes such as *s-, *p-, *-k. After the Warring State Period in China, Old Chinese developed and started to use tones as the classification of words. The suffix *-s also presented in the new classification system. The characteristics of Old Chinese were maintained in most dialects of southern China.\n\nThe Chinese dialects of Min and Wu which were mainly spoken in southern parts of China, had similarities in pronunciation with reptiles and birds as seen in the Old Tai-Kadai language according to You Rujie's research. The prefixes used for differentiating reptiles and birds in Chinese dialects showed similar features with the Old Tai-Kadai language. The old Tai-Kadai language was mainly used in the Xiangxi and Guizhou areas of China. You believed that these unique prefixes maintained by both the local dialects and the old Tai-Kadai language could be a product of local environmental influence.\n\nDialects in the Tibeto-Burman language area developed more conservatively; they keep the rules for pronunciation and word structure the same compared to Proto-Tibeto-Burman. The Tibetic languages are classified between fusional and analytic language; the Lolo-Burmese languages are mostly analytic languages, and the Jingpho languages are a mix of an agglutinative and fusional language. The Bodo–Garo and the Kuki-Chin–Naga languages possibly kept some particular characteristics of the putative Proto-Tibeto-Burman language such as agglutination and vowel prefixes. This phenomenon could be that the two language groups were separated early from the Proto-Tibeto-Burman language therefore did not undergo much development. The same happened to Sinitic, where its agglutinative property was kept even when it developed into an analytic language. Old Tibetan and the Qiangic both exhibit consonant clusters caused by the dropping of vowel prefixes, which is believed to be the same structure Proto-Sino-Tibetan had.\n\nOld Burmese and Old Tibetan dropped the vowel prefixes during the dialect acquisition, leaving only Tibeto-Burmese, Jingpho, the Bodo–Garo and Kuki-Chin–Naga languages that kept the vowel form of prefixes. The Lolo-Burmese languages and other languages from the Bodish-Himalayish language group preferred a suffix structure which they inherited from the Tibetan-Qiangic-Lolo-Burmese group. Their similarities could be proven by example like the phonetics of the Tibetic language for \"sun\": ŋi ma; Achang for \"sun\": ni mɔ; the Hakun language for \"sun\": nɔ ma; and Naxi for \"sun\": ŋi me. These inherited suffixes were later retained in these languages and became widespread in dialects of Old Tibetan, which caused the usage of the prefix in the modern language to decrease.\n\nAccording to Dai Qingxia, half of the vocabulary in the Jingpho language are disyllabic as well as most of the nouns of Jingpho. This significant amount of disyllabic words came from the consonant cluster in monosyllabic words and compound words mainly found in the Proto-Tibeto-Burman language. The development of the Sino-Tibetan language had been focused on solving the problem of phoneme rhyme, as well as coordinate the crucial point between monosyllabic morpheme and disyllabic word. Because the Sino-Tibetan language consists of a monosyllabic root, a prefix and suffix are needed for classifying word meaning and point of view (aspect?). The prefix *a- appeared in many Sino-Tibetan dialects to coordinate different morpheme structures. The repetition of a syllable has the same coordination effect.\n\nChinese and the Hmong-Mien and Kra–Dai languages are analytic languages that have similar grammar, pronunciation, and syllable structure. They all started with four tones, soon afterward developed into different phonological tones such as checked tone because of the voiced and voiceless properties of the initial. The aspiration of the initial and the length of the vowel in checked tone led to further tone development of dialects in these languages. Cantonese in Jiangyang area for Chinese developed eight different tones because of the length of the vowel. The aspiration property also determined the tone development of Kra-Dai, of which the tone eventually developed into sixteen types of tone. Zongdi dialect of Hmong-Mien had also experienced the change in tone because of the aspiration property.\n\nExcept for the Chinese, Bai, Karenic, and Mruic languages, the usual word order in Sino-Tibetan languages is object–verb. Most scholars believe this to be the original order, with Chinese, Karen and Bai having acquired subject–verb–object order due to the influence of neighbouring languages in the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area.\nHowever, Chinese and Bai differ from almost all other VO languages in the world in placing relative clauses before the nouns they modify.\n\nHodgson had in 1849 noted a dichotomy between \"pronominalized\" (inflecting) languages, stretching across the Himalayas from Himachal Pradesh to eastern Nepal, and \"non-pronominalized\" (isolating) languages. Konow (1909) explained the pronominalized languages as due to a Munda substratum, with the idea that Indo-Chinese languages were essentially isolating as well as tonal. Maspero later attributed the putative substratum to Indo-Aryan. It was not until Benedict that the inflectional systems of these languages were recognized as (partially) native to the family.\nScholars disagree over the extent to which the agreement system in the various languages can be reconstructed for the proto-language.\n\nIn morphosyntactic alignment, many Tibeto-Burman languages have ergative and/or anti-ergative (an argument that is not an actor) case marking. However, the anti-ergative case markings can not be reconstructed at higher levels in the family and are thought to be innovations.\n\nThere is no language originally in the Sino-Tibetan family that had classifiers, but some subgroups did develop some properties of classifier, such as the Lolo-Burmese languages which had cognate nouns as classifiers. Tibeto-Burman and Sinitic languages also developed classifiers that are used more commonly in South East Asia and are mainly used without numerals, such as in Rawang \"lègā tiq bok\" [book one classifier] meaning \"one book\", \"lègā bok\" meaning \"the book\"; in Cantonese yat ga che [one classifier vehicle] meaning \"one car\", ga che meaning \"the car\" (verbally). Some other classifiers in Tibeto-Burman and Sinitic languages developed the same use as definite or specific marking. Definite marking did not appear in the Proto-Sino-Tibetan language either, but there is some use of it in Qiangic of the Tibeto-Burmese languages, where the markings seem to evolve from demonstratives.\n\nBeyond the traditionally recognized families of Southeast Asia, a number of possible broader relationships have been suggested.\n\nOne of these is the \"Sino-Caucasian\" hypothesis of Sergei Starostin, which posits that the Yeniseian languages and North Caucasian languages form a clade with Sino-Tibetan. The Sino-Caucasian hypothesis has been expanded by others to \"Dené–Caucasian\" to include the Na-Dené languages of North America, Burushaski, Basque and, occasionally, Etruscan. Edward Sapir had commented on a connection between Na-Dené and Sino-Tibetan. A narrower binary Dené–Yeniseian family has recently been well-received, though not conclusively demonstrated.\n\nIn contrast, Laurent Sagart proposes a Sino-Austronesian family with Sino-Tibetan and Austronesian (including Kra–Dai as a subbranch) as primary branches.\nStanley Starosta has extended this proposal with a further branch called \"Yangzian\" joining Hmong–Mien and Austroasiatic.\n\n\n"}

It has articles. Started in May 2001, it reached 100,000 articles on March 8, 2006 and 1,000,000 articles on May 16, 2013. It is the 9th-largest Wikipedia as measured by the number of articles and has the 4th-largest number of edits.\n\nIn February 2002, Larry Sanger wrote an e-mail stating that Bomis was considering selling advertisements. Edgar Enyedy, a user on the Spanish Wikipedia, criticized the proposal. Jimmy Wales and Sanger responded by saying that they did not immediately plan to implement advertisements, but Enyedy began establishing a fork. Enciclopedia Libre was established by February 26, 2002. Enyedy persuaded most of the Spanish Wikipedians into going to the fork. By the end of 2002 over 10,000 articles were posted on the new site, and the Spanish Wikipedia was inactive for the rest of the year. Andrew Lih wrote that \"for a long time it seemed that Spanish Wikipeda would be the unfortunate runt left from the Spanish fork.\" The general popularity of Wikipedia attracted new users to the Spanish Wikipedia who were unfamiliar with the fork and these users came by June 2003. By the end of that year the Wikipedia had over 10,000 articles. The size of the Spanish Wikipedia overtook that of the fork in the northern hemisphere fall of 2004.\n\nLih stated in 2009 that the concepts of advertising and forking were still sensitive issues for the Wikipedia community because \"It took more than a year for the Spanish Wikipedia to get back on its feet again\" after the fork had been initiated.\n\nAfter the spin-off, the Spanish Wikipedia had very little activity until the upgrade to the Phase III of the software, later renamed MediaWiki, when the number of new users started to increase again. Both projects continue to co-exist, but the Spanish Wikipedia is by far the more active of the two.\n\nIt has the second largest number of users, after the English Wikipedia. However, it is ranked eighth for number of articles, below other Wikipedias devoted to languages with smaller numbers of speakers, such as German, French, Cebuano, Dutch and Russian. In terms of quality, parameters such as article size (over 2 KB: 40%) show it as the second out of the ten largest Wikipedias after the German one. As of October 2012, Spanish Wikipedia is the fourth Wikipedia in terms of the number of edits, as well as the third Wikipedia by the number of page views.\n\nBy country of origin, by September 2017, Spain was the main contributor to the Spanish Wikipedia (39.2% of edits). It is followed by Argentina (10.7%), Chile (8.8%), the Netherlands (8.4%), Mexico (7.0%), Venezuela (5.1%), Peru (3.5%), the United States (3.1%), Colombia (2.7%), Uruguay (1.3%) and Germany (1.1%).\n\nAmong the countries where Spanish is an official language, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Spain and Venezuela have established local chapters of the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\nFollowing a study by \"Netsuus\" (online market analysis enterprises) on the use of Wikipedia in Spain, it was revealed that most users consult Spanish Wikipedia (97%) compared to Wikipedias in other regional languages (2.17% for Wikipedia in Catalan, 0.64% in Galician and 0.26% in Basque).\n\n\nA comparative study by the \"\", made by Manuel Arias Maldonado (University of Malaga) and published in 2010, compared some articles with those of the English and German Wikipedias. It concluded that the Spanish version of Wikipedia was the least reliable of the three. It found it to be more cumbersome and imprecise than the German and English Wikipedias, stated that it often lacked reliable sources, including much unreferenced data, and found it to be too dependent on online references.\n\nDuring Wikimania 2009, free-software activist Richard Stallman criticized the Spanish Wikipedia for restricting links to the Rebelion.org left-wing web site and allegedly banning users who had complained about what had happened. Participants in the Spanish Wikipedia responded that Rebelion.org is primarily a news aggregator, that links to aggregators should be replaced with links to original publishers whenever possible, and that they considered the issue to be one of spam.\n\nAccording to a 2013 Oxford University study, five of the ten most disputed pages on the Spanish Wikipedia were football (soccer) clubs, including Club América, FC Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao, Alianza Lima, and Newell's Old Boys.\n\n"}
{"id": "28504786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28504786", "title": "Stock market data systems", "text": "Stock market data systems\n\nStock market data systems communicated market data—information about securities and stock trades—from stock exchanges to stockbrokers and stock traders.\n\nThe earliest stock exchanges were in France in the 12th century and in Bruges and Italy in the 13th. Presumably data about trades in those times was written down by scribes and traveled by courier. In the early 19th century Reuters sent data by carrier pigeons between Germany and Belgium In London early exchanges were located near coffee houses which may have played a part in trading.\n\nIn the late 1860s, in New York, young men called “runners” prices between the exchange and broker’s offices, and often these prices were posted by hand on large chalk boards in the offices. Updating a chalk board was an entry point for many traders getting into financial markets and as mentioned in the book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator those updating the boards would wear fur sleeves so they wouldn't accidentally erase prices.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange is known as the \"Big Board\", perhaps because of these large chalk boards. Until recently, in some countries such chalkboards continued in use. Morse code was used in Chicago until 1967 for traders to send data to clerks called \"board markers\".\n\nFrom 1797 to 1811 in the United States, the \"New York Price Current\" was first published. It was apparently the first newspaper to publish stock prices, and also showed prices of various commodities.\n\nIn 1884 the Dow Jones company published the first stock market averages, and in 1889 the first issue of the \"Wall Street Journal\" appeared. As time passed, other newspapers added market pages. The \"New York Times\" was first published in 1851, and added stock market tables at a later date.\n\nIn 1863 Edward A. Calahan of the American Telegraph Company invented a stock telegraph printing instrument which allowed data on stocks, bonds, and commodities to be sent directly from exchanges to broker offices around the country. It printed the data on wide paper tape wound on large reels. The sound it made while printing earned it the name \"stock ticker\". Other inventors improved on this device, and ultimately Thomas Edison patented a \"universal stock ticker\", selling over 5,000 in the late 19th century.\n\nIn the early 20th century Western Union acquired rights to an improved ticker which could deal with the increasing volume of stocks sold per day.\n\nAt the time of the stock market crash in October, 1929, trading volumes were so high that the tickers fell behind, contributing to the panic. In the 1930s the New York Quotation Stock Ticker became widely used. A further improvement was in place in 1960.\n\nIn 1923 Trans Lux Corporation delivered a rear projection system which projected the moving ticker onto a screen where all in a brokerage office could see it. It was a great success, and by 1949 there were more than 1400 stock-ticker projectors in the U.S. and another 200 in Canada. \nIn 1959 they started shipping a Trans-Video system called CCTV which gave a customer a small video desk monitor where he could monitor the tickers.\n\nIn August 1963 Ultronics introduced Lectrascan, the first wall mounted all electronic ticker display system. By 1964 there were over 1100 units in operation in stock broker offices in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nCompetition, including Ultronics' Lectrscan electron wall system, led Trans-Lux to introduce the Trans-Lux Jet. Jets of air controlled lighted disks which moved on a belt on the broker's wall. Brokers ordered over 1000 units in the first six months, and by the middle of 1969 more than 3000 were in use in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nA quotation board is a large vertical electronic display located in a brokerage office, which automatically gives current data on stocks chosen by the local broker. In 1929 the Teleregister Corporation installed the first such display, and by 1964 over 650 brokerage offices had them.\n\nThe information included the previous day’s closing price, opening price, high for the day, low for the day, and current price. Teleregister offered data from the New York, American, Midwest, Chicago Mercantile, Commodity, New York Cocoa, New York coffee and sugar, New York Mercantile, New York Produce, New York Cotton, and New Orleans Cotton exchanges, along with the Chicago Board of Trade.\n\nSome firms had a battery of telephone operators seated in front of a Teleregister board to supply commission houses with price and volume data. In 1962 two such batteries handled over 39,000 calls per day.\n\nIn 1955 Scantlin Electronics, Inc. introduced a competitive display system very similar in appearance but with digits twice the size of Teleregister’s, fitting into the same board area. It was less expensive and soon was installed in many broker offices.\n\nIn the late 1950s brokers had become accustomed to several problems doing business with their customers. To make a trade, an investor had to know the current price for the stock. The investor got this from a broker who could find it on his board. If the last trade (or the stock itself) hadn't made it to the board (or there was no board) the broker telegraphed a request for the price to that firm's \"wire room\" in New York. There, such requests would be forwarded to the floor of the appropriate exchange, where messengers could copy down prices at the locations where those stocks were traded, and telephone answers back to the wire room. Typical elapsed times were between 15 and 30 minutes just to inform the broker.\n\nJack Scantlin of Scantlin Electronics, Inc. (SEI) developed the Quotron I system, consisting of a magnetic tape storage unit that could be sited at a brokerage and Desk Units with a keyboard and printer. The storage unit recorded the data from the ticker line. Brokers could enter the stock symbol on a desk unit. This triggered a backward search on the magnetic tape (which continued recording incoming ticker data). When a transaction was located, the price was sent to the desk unit, which printed it on a tape.\n\nThe first Quotron units were installed in 1960, and were an immediate success. By the end of 1961 brokers were leasing Quotrons in some 800 offices, serving some 2,500 desk units across the United States.\n\nQuotron’s success attracted the attention of Robert S. Sinn, who observed its disadvantages: it could only give a last price. The opening price, high and low for the day, and share volume were not available. His system received the ticker transmissions from the various stock and commodity exchanges. These were then automatically interpreted by a hard wired digital computer updating a \"drum memory\" with the last sale prices and at the same time computing and updating highs and lows and total volume for each stock. As these items were updated a data packet would be generated for transmission by AT&T Dataphone at 1000 bits/second to identical magnetic drum storage devices in each major city in the United States. These slave drum memory units located in the metropolitan centers in the US could then be accessed by desk units in local stock brokerage offices again using Dataphone transmission. The desk units would set up the ticker symbol code for the desired stock by mechanical means actuating micro switches. The local control box would continuously interrogate each desk unit in sequence and send a request data packet by Dataphone to the local drum memory which would then send return data packets back to the local brokerage office. Each packet both for request and answer would contain the request stock alphabetic symbols plus a desk unit identifier. Because the desk units set up the requested stock code statically the desk unit would automatically update the stock price, volume, and highs and lows without any operator intervention because the control unit could complete the interrogation of all desk units in the office in about every one or two seconds, This is the first use of data packet transmission with the sender’s identification imbedded in the data packet in order to avoid switching- a forerunner of the internet? There was no switching in the entire system; all was done with data packets containing sender identifiers.\n\nSinn formed Ultronic Systems Corp. in December 1960, and was president and CEO from then until he left the company in 1970. By the fall of 1961 Ultronics had installed its first desk units (Stockmaster) in New York and Philadelphia, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles. The Stockmaster desk units offered the user quick access and continuous monitoring of last sale, bid, ask, high, low, total volume, open, close, earnings, and dividends for each stock on the NYSE and the AMEX plus commodities from the various U.S. commodity exchanges. Ultimately Ultronics and General Telephone (which bought Ultronics in 1967) installed some 10,000 units world-wide. In June 1964 Ultronics and the British news company Reuters signed a joint venture agreement to market Stockmaster worldwide outside of North America. This venture lasted for 10 years and was very successful, capturing the worldwide market for U.S. stock and commodity price information. Ultronics invented time division multiplex equipment to utilize Reuters’ voice grade lines to Europe and the Far East to transmit U.S. stock and commodity information plus Reuters’ teletype news channels.\n\nIn the early 1960s when these first desk top quotation units were developed the only real time information available from the various stock and commodity exchanges were the last sale and the bid and ask ticker lines. The last sale ticker contained every trade with both price and volume for each trade. The bid-ask ticker contained only the two prices and no size. The volume of data on the last sale ticker was therefore much greater than on the bid-ask ticker. Because of this, on high volume days the last sale ticker would run as much as fifteen minutes behind the bid-ask ticker. This time difference made having the bid-ask on their desk top unit extremely important to a stockbroker even though there was an extra charge to the exchange for this information.\nScantlin Electronics reacted immediately to the Ultronic threat. In early 1962 they began work on their own computer-based system and put it into service in December, 1962. It used four Control Data CDC 160A computers in New York which recorded trading data in magnetic core memory. Major cities hosted Central Office equipment connected to newly designed Quotron II desk units in brokerage offices on which a broker could request, for any stock, price and net change from the opening, or a summary which included highs, lows, and volumes (later SEI added other features like dividends and earnings). The requests went to a Central Office, which condensed and forwarded them to the New York computer. Replies followed the sequence in reverse. The data was transmitted on AT&T's Dataphone high-speed telephone service. In 1963 the new system was accepted by many brokers, and was installed in hundreds of their offices.\n\nAt the end of each day, this same system transmitted stock market pages to United Press International, which in turn sold them to its newspaper customers all over the world.\n\nWhen Ultronics introduced their Stockmaster desk units in 1961 they priced the service at approximately the same price as the Quotron desk units. They did not want a price competition only a performance competition. All of these stock quote devices were sold on leases with monthly rental charges. The cost of the system, desk units and installation was therefore born solely by the vendor not the customer (broker). The pricing at that time made the units quite profitable and allowed the companies to finance the cost and use rapid accounting depreciation of the equipment. In 1964 Teleregister introduced their Telequote desk units at prices significantly less than Stockmaster or Quotron. This forced Ultronics and Scantlin to reduce the prices of their Stockmaster and Quotron systems. The Telequote desk units never did gain a significant share of the desk top quotation business, but their price cutting did seriously reduce the overall profitability of this business in the U.S.. Ultronics was fortunate to have made the joint venture arrangement with Reuters for the stock quotation business outside of North America where this price cutting was not a factor.\n\nThe 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis blocked Ultronics from winning a historic first. In July 1962 AT&T launched the first commercial satellite (Telstar) to transmit television and telephone voice channels between the U.S. and England and France. This was a non-synchronous satellite which circled the earth in an elliptical orbit of about 2.5 hours, such that it gave only about 20 minutes of communication between the U.S. and Europe on each pass. Ultronics arranged with AT&T to use one of its voice channels to transmit U.S. stock prices to Paris in October 1962. All of the arrangements were made-a Stockmaster unit was installed in the Bache brokerage office on Rue Royale and all of the American Stockbrokers and the press and television were ready for this historic event. About two hours before the pass the stock transmission was cancelled because U.S. president John Kennedy was going to use the pass to send his speech to France concerning the Cuban missile crisis.\n\nIn 1964 Teleregister introduced the Am-Quote system with which a broker could enter code numbers into a standard telephone; a second later a pleasant (prerecorded) voice repeated the code numbers and provided the required price information. This system, like Ultronics’, made use of magnetic drums.\n\nNASDAQ, founded in 1972 was the first electronic stock market. It was originally designed only as an electronic quotation system, with no ability to perform electronic trades. Other systems soon followed and by the turn of the century, every exchange was using this model.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1982558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982558", "title": "Tangut language", "text": "Tangut language\n\nTangut (also Xīxià or Hsi-Hsia or Mi-nia) is an ancient northeastern Tibeto-Burman language once spoken in the Western Xia, also known as the Tangut Empire. It is classified by some linguists as a Qiangic language, which includes the Northern and Southern Qiang languages and the Rgyalrong languages, among others.\n\nTangut was one of the official languages of the Western Xia (known in Tibetan as \"Mi nyag\" and in Chinese as 彌藥 Míyào), which was founded by the Tangut people and obtained its independence from the Song dynasty at the beginning of the 11th century. The Western Xia were annihilated when Genghis Khan invaded in 1226.\n\nThe Tangut language has its own script, the Tangut script.\n\nThe latest known text written in the Tangut language, the Tangut dharani pillars, dates to 1502, suggesting that the language was still in use nearly three hundred years after the destruction of the Tangut Empire.\n\nModern research into the Tangut languages began in the late 19th century and early 20th century when S. W. Bushell, Gabriel Devéria, and Georges Morisse separately published decipherments of a number of Tangut characters found on Western Xia coins, in a Chinese-Tangut bilingual inscription on a stele at Wuwei, Gansu, and in a copy of the Tangut translation of the Lotus Sutra.\n\nThe majority of extant Tangut texts were excavated at Khara-Khoto in 1909 by Pyotr Kozlov, and the script was identified as that of the Tangut state of Xixia. Such scholars as Aleksei Ivanovich Ivanov, Ishihama Juntaro (石濱純太郎), Berthold Laufer, Luo Fuchang (羅福萇), Luo Fucheng (羅福成), and Wang Jingru (王靜如) have contributed to research on the Tangut language. The most significant contribution was made by the Russian scholar Nikolai Aleksandrovich Nevsky (1892–1937), who compiled the first Tangut Dictionary and reconstructed the meaning of a number of Tangut grammatical particles, thus making it possible to actually read and understand Tangut texts. His scholarly achievements were published posthumously in 1960 under the title \"Tangutskaya Filologiya\" (Tangut Philology) and the scholar was eventually (and posthumously) awarded the Soviet Lenin Prize for his work. The understanding of the Tangut language is far from perfect: Although certain aspects of the morphology (Ksenia Kepping, \"The Morphology of the Tangut Language\", Moscow: Nauka, 1985) and grammar (Tatsuo Nishida, \"Seika go no kenkyū\", etc.) are understood, the syntactic structure of Tangut remains largely unexplored.\n\nThe Khara-Khoto documents are at present preserved in the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. These survived the Siege of Leningrad, but a number of manuscripts in the possession of Nevsky at the time of his arrest by the NKVD in 1937 went missing, and were returned, under mysterious circumstances, to the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts only in October 1991. The collections amount to about 10,000 volumes, of mostly Buddhist texts, law codes and legal documents dating from mid-11th up to early 13th centuries. Among the Buddhist texts a number of unique compilations, not known either in Chinese or in Tibetan versions, were recently discovered. Furthermore, the Buddhist canon, the Chinese classics, and a great number of indigenous texts written in Tangut have been preserved. These other major Tangut collections, though much smaller in size, belong to the British Library, the National Library in Beijing, the Library of Beijing University and other libraries.\n\nThe connection between the writing and the pronunciation of the Tangut language is even more tenuous than that between Chinese writing and the modern Chinese varieties. Thus although in Chinese more than 90% of the characters possess a phonetic element, this proportion is limited to about 10% in Tangut according to Sofronov. The reconstruction of Tangut pronunciation must resort to other sources.\n\nThe discovery of the \"Pearl in the Palm\", a Tangut-Chinese bilingual glossary, permitted Ivanov (1909) and Laufer (1916) to propose initial reconstructions and to undertake the comparative study of Tangut. This glossary in effect indicates the pronunciation of each Tangut character with one or several Chinese characters, and inversely each Chinese character with one or more Tangut characters. The second source is the corpus of Tibetan transcriptions of Tangut. These data were studied for the first time by Nevsky (Nevskij) (1925).\n\nNonetheless, these two sources were not in themselves sufficient for a systematic reconstruction of Tangut. In effect, these transcriptions were not written with the intention of representing with precision the pronunciation of Tangut, but instead simply to help foreigners to pronounce and memorize the words of one language with the words of another which they could understand.\n\nThe third source, which constitutes the basis of the modern reconstructions, consists of monolingual Tangut dictionaries: the \"Wenhai\" (文海), two editions of the \"Tongyin\" (同音), the \"Wenhai zalei\" (文海雜類) and an untitled dictionary. The record of the pronunciation in these dictionaries is made using the principle of \"fǎnqiè\", borrowed from the Chinese lexicographic tradition. Although these dictionaries may differ on small details (e.g. the \"Tongyin\" categorizes the characters according to syllable initial and rime without taking any account of tone), they all adopt the same system of 105 rimes. A certain number of rimes are in complementary distribution with respect to the place of articulation of the initials, e.g. rimes 10 and 11 or rimes 36 and 37, which shows that the scholars who composed these dictionaries had made a very precise phonological analysis of their language.\n\nIn distinction to the transcription in foreign languages, the Tangut \"fanqie\" makes distinctions among the rhymes in a systematic and very precise manner. Due to the \"fǎnqiè\", we now have a good understanding of the phonological categories of the language. Nonetheless, it is necessary to compare the phonological system of the dictionaries with the other sources in order to \"fill in\" the categories with a phonetic value.\n\nN. A. Nevsky reconstructed Tangut grammar and provided the first Tangut–Chinese–English–Russian dictionary, which together with the collection of his papers was published posthumously in 1960 under the title \"Tangut Philology\" (Moscow: 1960). Later, substantial contribution to the research of Tangut language was done by , Ksenia Kepping, Gong Hwang-cherng (龔煌城), M.V. Sofronov and Li Fanwen (李範文). Marc Miyake has published on Tangut phonology and diachronics. There are four Tangut dictionaries available: the one composed by N.A. Nevsky, one composed by Nishida (1966), one composed by Li Fanwen (1997, revised edition 2008) and one composed by Yevgeny Kychanov (2006).\n\nThere is growing a school of Tangut studies in China. Leading scholars include Shi Jinbo (史金波), Li Fanwen, Nie Hongyin (聶鴻音), Bai Bin (白濱) in mainland China, and Gong Hwang-cherng and Lin Ying-chin (林英津) in Taiwan. In other countries, leading scholars in the field include Yevgeny Kychanov and his student K. J. Solonin in Russia, Nishida Tatsuo and in Japan, and Ruth W. Dunnell in the United States.\n\nThe Tangut syllable has a CV structure and carries one of two distinctive tones, flat or rising. Following the tradition of Chinese phonological analysis the Tangut syllable is divided into initial (声母) and rhyme (韻母) (i.e. the remaining syllable minus the initial).\n\nThe consonants are divided into the following categories:\n\nThe rhyme books distinguish 105 rhyme classes, which are, in turn, classified in several ways:/grade (等), type (環), and class (攝).\n\nTangut rhymes occur in three types (環). They are seen in the tradition of Nishida, followed by both Arakawa and Gong as 'normal' (普通母音), 'tense' (緊候母音), and 'retroflex' (捲舌母音). Gong leaves normal vowels unmarked and places a dot under tense vowels and an -r after retroflex vowels. Arakawa differs only by indicating tense vowels with a final -q.\n\nThe rhyme books distinguish four vowel grades (等). In early phonetic reconstructions, all four were separately accounted for, but it has since been realized that grades three and four are in complementary distribution, depending on the initial. Consequently, the reconstructions of Arakawa and Gong do not account for this distinction. Gong represents these three grades as V, iV, and jV. Arakawa accounts for them as V, iV, and V.\n\nIn general rhyme class (攝), corresponds to the set of all rhymes under the same rhyme type which have the same main vowel.\n\nGong further posits phonemic vowel length and points to evidence that indicates that Tangut had a distinction that Chinese lacked. There is no certainty that the distinction was vowel length and so other researchers have remained skeptical.\n\nMiyake reconstructs the vowels differently. In his reconstruction, the 95 vowels of Tangut formed from a six-vowel system in Pre-Tangut because of preinitial loss. (The two vowels in parentheses appeared only in loanwords from Chinese, and many of the vowels in class III were in complementary distribution with their equivalents in class IV.)\n\n"}
{"id": "31730306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31730306", "title": "Transculturalism", "text": "Transculturalism\n\nTransculturalism is defined as \"seeing oneself in the other\". Transcultural (pronunciation: trans kul′c̸hər əl or tranz kul′c̸hər əl) is in turn described as \"extending through all human cultures\" or \"involving, encompassing, or combining elements of more than one culture\".\n\nIn 1940, transculturalism was originally defined by Fernando Ortiz, a Cuban scholar, based on the article \"Nuestra America\" (1881) by José Marti. From Marti Gra's idea, Ortiz thought that transculturalism was the key in legitimizing the [hemispheric] identity. Thus Ortiz defined transculturalism as the synthesis of two phases occurring simultaneously, one being a deculturalization\nof the past with a \"métissage\" (see métis, as in the Métis population of Canada and the United States) with the present, which further means the \"reinventing of the new common culture\". Such reinvention of a new common culture is in turn based on the meeting and intermingling of the different peoples and cultures. According to Lamberto Tassinari, the director of \"Vice Versa\", a transcultural magazine in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, transculturalism is a new form of humanism based on the idea of relinquishing the strong traditional identities and cultures which […] were [the] products of imperialistic empires [...] interspersed with dogmatic religious values. Tassinari further declared that transculturalism opposes the singular traditional cultures that evolved from the nation-state. He also stated that transculturalism is based on the breaking down of boundaries, and is contrary to multiculturalism because in the latter most experiences that have shown [reinforces] boundaries based on past cultural heritages. And that in transculturalism the concept of culture is at the center of the nation-state or the disappearance of the nationstate itself. In this context, German cultural scholar Dagmar Reichardt stresses the didactical relevance of a paradigmatic shift in academia through Transcultural Studies, mainly focusing on the European model of conviviality in a globalized world.\n\nAnother source of transculturalism is the work of American and Russian critical thinker Mikhail Epstein, beginning in 1982, and later supported by Ellen Berry, Arianna Dagnino, Slobodanka Vladiv–Glover and others. The theory of transculture is developed in Mikhail Epstein's book \"After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture\" (Amherst: The University of Massachusetts Press, 1995, 392 pp.) and especially in Mikhail Epstein's and Ellen Berry's book \"Transcultural Experiments: Russian and American Models of Creative Communication\" (New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 1999, 340 pp.; of 23 chapters, 16 are written by M. Epstein). Within a comparative literary context, the theory of the transcultural is further developed by Dagnino in her book \"Transcultural Writers and Novels in the Age of Global Mobility\" (West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2015, 240 pp).\n\nAccording to Richard Slimbach, author of \"The Transcultural Journey\", transculturalism is rooted in the pursuit to define shared interests and common values across cultural and national borders. Slimbach further stated that transculturalism can be tested by means of thinking \"outside the box of one's motherland\" and by \"seeing many sides of every question without abandoning conviction, and allowing for a chameleon sense of self without losing one's cultural center\".\n\nAccording to Jeff Lewis, transculturalism is characterised by cultural fluidity and the dynamics of cultural change. Whether by conflict, necessity, revolution or the slow progress of interaction, different groups share their stories, symbols, values, meanings and experiences. This process of sharing and perpetual 'beaching' releases the solidity and stability of culture, creating the condition for transfer and transition. More than simple 'multiculturalism', which seeks to solidify difference as ontology, 'transculturalism' acknowledges the uneven interspersion of Difference and Sameness. It allows human individuals groups to adapt and adopt new discourses, values, ideas and knowledge systems. It acknowledges that culture is always in a state of flux, and always seeking new terrains of knowing and being.\n\nTransculturalism is the mobilization of the definition of culture through the expression and deployment of new forms of cultural politics. Based on Jeff Lewis’ From Culturalism to Transculturalism, transculturalism is charactized by the following:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33426", "title": "Wave–particle duality", "text": "Wave–particle duality\n\nWave–particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics that every particle or quantum entity may be partly described in terms not only of particles, but also of waves. It expresses the inability of the classical concepts \"particle\" or \"wave\" to fully describe the behavior of quantum-scale objects. As Albert Einstein wrote:\n\nThrough the work of Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Louis de Broglie, Arthur Compton, Niels Bohr and many others, current scientific theory holds that all particles exhibit a wave nature and vice versa. This phenomenon has been verified not only for elementary particles, but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules. For macroscopic particles, because of their extremely short wavelengths, wave properties usually cannot be detected.\n\nAlthough the use of the wave-particle duality has worked well in physics, the meaning or interpretation has not been satisfactorily resolved; see Interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n\nBohr regarded the \"duality paradox\" as a fundamental or metaphysical fact of nature. A given kind of quantum object will exhibit sometimes wave, sometimes particle, character, in respectively different physical settings. He saw such duality as one aspect of the concept of complementarity. Bohr regarded renunciation of the cause-effect relation, or complementarity, of the space-time picture, as essential to the quantum mechanical account.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the question further. He saw the duality as present for all quantic entities, but not quite in the usual quantum mechanical account considered by Bohr. He saw it in what is called second quantization, which generates an entirely new concept of fields which exist in ordinary space-time, causality still being visualizable. Classical field values (e.g. the electric and magnetic field strengths of Maxwell) are replaced by an entirely new kind of field value, as considered in quantum field theory. Turning the reasoning around, ordinary quantum mechanics can be deduced as a specialized consequence of quantum field theory.\n\nDemocritus,the original atomist,argued that all things in the universe, including light, are composed of indivisible sub-components (light being some form of solar atom). At the beginning of the 11th Century, the Arabic scientist Ibn al-Haytham wrote the first comprehensive \"Book of optics\" describing refraction, reflection, and the operation of a pinhole lens via rays of light traveling from the point of emission to the eye. He asserted that these rays were composed of particles of light. In 1630, René Descartes popularized and accredited the opposing wave description in his treatise on light, \"The World (Descartes)\", showing that the behavior of light could be re-created by modeling wave-like disturbances in a universal medium i.e. luminiferous aether. Beginning in 1670 and progressing over three decades, Isaac Newton developed and championed his corpuscular theory, arguing that the perfectly straight lines of reflection demonstrated light's particle nature; only particles could travel in such straight lines. He explained refraction by positing that particles of light accelerated laterally upon entering a denser medium. Around the same time, Newton's contemporaries Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens—and later Augustin-Jean Fresnel mathematically refined the wave viewpoint, showing that if light traveled at different speeds in different media (such as water and air), refraction could be easily explained as the medium-dependent propagation of light waves. The resulting Huygens–Fresnel principle was extremely successful at reproducing light's behavior and was subsequently supported by Thomas Young's 1801 discovery of interference by his double-slit experiment. The wave view did not immediately displace the ray and particle view, but began to dominate scientific thinking about light in the mid 19th century, since it could explain polarization phenomena that the alternatives could not.\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell discovered that he could apply his previously discovered Maxwell's equations, along with a slight modification to describe self-propagating waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. It quickly became apparent that visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared light were all electromagnetic waves of differing frequency. The wave theory had prevailed or at least it seemed to. While the 19th century had seen the success of the wave theory at describing light, it had also witnessed the rise of the atomic theory at describing matter.\n\nAt the close of the 19th century, the reductionism of atomic theory began to advance into the atom itself determining, through physics, the nature of the atom and the operation of chemical reactions. Electricity, first thought to be a fluid, was now understood to consist of particles called electrons. This was first demonstrated by J. J. Thomson in 1897 when, using a cathode ray tube, he found that an electrical charge would travel across a vacuum. Since the vacuum offered no medium for an electric fluid to travel, this discovery could only be explained via a particle carrying a negative charge and moving through the vacuum. This electron flew in the face of classical electrodynamics, which had successfully treated electricity as a fluid for many years (leading to the invention of batteries, electric motors, dynamos, and arc lamps). More importantly, the intimate relation between electric charge and electromagnetism had been well documented following the discoveries of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell. Since electromagnetism was known to be a wave generated by a changing electric or magnetic field (a continuous, wave-like entity itself) an atomic/particle description of electricity and charge was a non sequitur. Furthermore, classical electrodynamics was not the only classical theory rendered incomplete.\n\nIn 1901, Max Planck published an analysis that succeeded in reproducing the observed spectrum of light emitted by a glowing object. To accomplish this, Planck had to make an ad hoc mathematical assumption of quantized energy of the oscillators (atoms of the black body) that emit radiation. Einstein later proposed that electromagnetic radiation itself is quantized, not the energy of radiating atoms.\n\nBlack-body radiation, the emission of electromagnetic energy due to an object's heat, could not be explained from classical arguments alone. The equipartition theorem of classical mechanics, the basis of all classical thermodynamic theories, stated that an object's energy is partitioned equally among the object's vibrational modes. But applying the same reasoning to the electromagnetic emission of such a thermal object was not so successful. That thermal objects emit light had been long known. Since light was known to be waves of electromagnetism, physicists hoped to describe this emission via classical laws. This became known as the black body problem. Since the equipartition theorem worked so well in describing the vibrational modes of the thermal object itself, it was natural to assume that it would perform equally well in describing the radiative emission of such objects. But a problem quickly arose if each mode received an equal partition of energy, the short wavelength modes would consume all the energy. This became clear when plotting the Rayleigh–Jeans law which, while correctly predicting the intensity of long wavelength emissions, predicted infinite total energy as the intensity diverges to infinity for short wavelengths. This became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.\n\nIn 1900, Max Planck hypothesized that the frequency of light emitted by the black body depended on the frequency of the oscillator that emitted it, and the energy of these oscillators increased linearly with frequency (according E = hν where h is Planck's constant). This was not an unsound proposal considering that macroscopic oscillators operate similarly when studying five simple harmonic oscillators of equal amplitude but different frequency, the oscillator with the highest frequency possesses the highest energy (though this relationship is not linear like Planck's). By demanding that high-frequency light must be emitted by an oscillator of equal frequency, and further requiring that this oscillator occupy higher energy than one of a lesser frequency, Planck avoided any catastrophe; giving an equal partition to high-frequency oscillators produced successively fewer oscillators and less emitted light. And as in the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, the low-frequency, low-energy oscillators were suppressed by the onslaught of thermal jiggling from higher energy oscillators, which necessarily increased their energy and frequency.\n\nThe most revolutionary aspect of Planck's treatment of the black body is that it inherently relies on an integer number of oscillators in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators \"give\" their entire energy to the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, as often as they are \"excited\" by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally created an atomic theory of the black body, but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light, where the black body never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less than hν. However, once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he denounced particles of light as a limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.\n\nWhile Planck had solved the ultraviolet catastrophe by using atoms and a quantized electromagnetic field, most contemporary physicists agreed that Planck's \"light quanta\" represented only flaws in his model. A more-complete derivation of black body radiation would yield a fully continuous and 'wave-like' electromagnetic field with no quantization. However, in 1905 Albert Einstein took Planck's black body model to produce his solution to another outstanding problem of the day: the photoelectric effect, wherein electrons are emitted from atoms when they absorb energy from light. Since their existence was theorized eight years previously, phenomenon had been studied with the electron model in mind in physics laboratories worldwide.\n\nIn 1902 Philipp Lenard discovered that the energy of these ejected electrons did \"not\" depend on the intensity of the incoming light, but instead on its \"frequency\". So if one shines a little low-frequency light upon a metal, a few low energy electrons are ejected. If one now shines a very intense beam of low-frequency light upon the same metal, a whole slew of electrons are ejected; however they possess the same low energy, there are merely \"more of them\". The more light there is, the more electrons are ejected. Whereas in order to get high energy electrons, one must illuminate the metal with high-frequency light. Like blackbody radiation, this was at odds with a theory invoking continuous transfer of energy between radiation and matter. However, it can still be explained using a fully classical description of light, as long as matter is quantum mechanical in nature.\n\nIf one used Planck's energy quanta, and demanded that electromagnetic radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quantum hν, then the photoelectric effect could be explained very simply. Low-frequency light only ejects low-energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon. Increasing the intensity of the low-frequency light (increasing the number of photons) only increases the number of excited electrons, not their energy, because the energy of each photon remains low. Only by increasing the frequency of the light, and thus increasing the energy of the photons, can one eject electrons with higher energy. Thus, using Planck's constant \"h\" to determine the energy of the photons based upon their frequency, the energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency; the gradient of the line being Planck's constant. These results were not confirmed until 1915, when Robert Andrews Millikan, who had previously determined the charge of the electron, produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein's predictions. In fact, Millikan experimented for full ten years from 1906-1916 aimed at disproving Einstein's photoelectric equation.However the value of Planck's constant determined from his experiments came out to be very close to the original value. Thus, the he established the validity of Einstein's photoelectric equation instead of disproving it. \n\nWhile energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck's constant, the existence of photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the photon antibunching effect, of which a modern experiment can be performed in undergraduate-level labs. This phenomenon could only be explained via photons, and not through any semi-classical theory (which could alternatively explain the photoelectric effect). When Einstein received his Nobel Prize in 1921, it was not for his more difficult and mathematically laborious special and general relativity, but for the simple, yet totally revolutionary, suggestion of quantized light. Einstein's \"light quanta\" would not be called photons until 1925, but even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave-particle duality. Electromagnetic radiation propagates following linear wave equations, but can only be emitted or absorbed as discrete elements, thus acting as a wave and a particle simultaneously.\n\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein provided an explanation of the photoelectric effect, a hitherto troubling experiment that the wave theory of light seemed incapable of explaining. He did so by postulating the existence of photons, quanta of light energy with particulate qualities.\n\nIn the photoelectric effect, it was observed that shining a light on certain metals would lead to an electric current in a circuit. Presumably, the light was knocking electrons out of the metal, causing current to flow. However, using the case of potassium as an example, it was also observed that while a dim blue light was enough to cause a current, even the strongest, brightest red light available with the technology of the time caused no current at all. According to the classical theory of light and matter, the strength or amplitude of a light wave was in proportion to its brightness: a bright light should have been easily strong enough to create a large current. Yet, oddly, this was not so.\n\nEinstein explained this enigma by postulating that the electrons can receive energy from electromagnetic field only in discrete portions (quanta that were called photons): an amount of energy \"E\" that was related to the frequency \"f\" of the light by\n\nwhere \"h\" is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10 J seconds). Only photons of a high enough frequency (above a certain \"threshold\" value) could knock an electron free. For example, photons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an electron from the metal, but photons of red light did not. One photon of light above the threshold frequency could release only one electron; the higher the frequency of a photon, the higher the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, but no amount of light (using technology available at the time) below the threshold frequency could release an electron. To \"violate\" this law would require extremely high-intensity lasers which had not yet been invented. Intensity-dependent phenomena have now been studied in detail with such lasers.\n\nEinstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.\n\nIn 1924, Louis-Victor de Broglie formulated the de Broglie hypothesis, claiming that \"all\" matter, not just light, has a wave-like nature; he related wavelength (denoted as \"λ\"), and momentum (denoted as \"p\"):\n\nThis is a generalization of Einstein's equation above, since the momentum of a photon is given by \"p\" = formula_3 and the wavelength (in a vacuum) by \"λ\" = formula_4, where \"c\" is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nDe Broglie's formula was confirmed three years later for electrons (which differ from photons in having a rest mass) with the observation of electron diffraction in two independent experiments. At the University of Aberdeen, George Paget Thomson passed a beam of electrons through a thin metal film and observed the predicted interference patterns. At Bell Labs, Clinton Joseph Davisson and Lester Halbert Germer guided their beam through a crystalline grid.\n\nDe Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929 for his hypothesis. Thomson and Davisson shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937 for their experimental work.\n\nIn his work on formulating quantum mechanics, Werner Heisenberg postulated his uncertainty principle, which states:\n\nwhere\n\nHeisenberg originally explained this as a consequence of the process of measuring: Measuring position accurately would disturb momentum and vice versa, offering an example (the \"gamma-ray microscope\") that depended crucially on the de Broglie hypothesis. The thought is now, however, that this only partly explains the phenomenon, but that the uncertainty also exists in the particle itself, even before the measurement is made.\n\nIn fact, the modern explanation of the uncertainty principle, extending the Copenhagen interpretation first put forward by Bohr and Heisenberg, depends even more centrally on the wave nature of a particle: Just as it is nonsensical to discuss the precise location of a wave on a string, particles do not have perfectly precise positions; likewise, just as it is nonsensical to discuss the wavelength of a \"pulse\" wave traveling down a string, particles do not have perfectly precise momenta (which corresponds to the inverse of wavelength). Moreover, when position is relatively well defined, the wave is pulse-like and has a very ill-defined wavelength (and thus momentum). And conversely, when momentum (and thus wavelength) is relatively well defined, the wave looks long and sinusoidal, and therefore it has a very ill-defined position.\n\nDe Broglie himself had proposed a pilot wave construct to explain the observed wave-particle duality. In this view, each particle has a well-defined position and momentum, but is guided by a wave function derived from Schrödinger's equation. The pilot wave theory was initially rejected because it generated non-local effects when applied to systems involving more than one particle. Non-locality, however, soon became established as an integral feature of quantum theory (see EPR paradox), and David Bohm extended de Broglie's model to explicitly include it.\n\nIn the resulting representation, also called the de Broglie–Bohm theory or Bohmian mechanics, the wave-particle duality vanishes, and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the particle's motion is subject to a guiding equation or quantum potential. \"This idea seems to me so natural and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, that it is a great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored\", J.S.Bell.\n\nThe best illustration of the \"pilot-wave model\" was given by Couder's 2010 \"walking droplets\" experiments, demonstrating the pilot-wave behaviour in a macroscopic mechanical analog.\n\nSince the demonstrations of wave-like properties in photons and electrons, similar experiments have been conducted with neutrons and protons. Among the most famous experiments are those of Estermann and Otto Stern in 1929.\nAuthors of similar recent experiments with atoms and molecules, described below, claim that these larger particles also act like waves.\n\nA dramatic series of experiments emphasizing the action of gravity in relation to wave–particle duality was conducted in the 1970s using the neutron interferometer. Neutrons, one of the components of the atomic nucleus, provide much of the mass of a nucleus and thus of ordinary matter. In the neutron interferometer, they act as quantum-mechanical waves directly subject to the force of gravity. While the results were not surprising since gravity was known to act on everything, including light (see tests of general relativity and the Pound–Rebka falling photon experiment), the self-interference of the quantum mechanical wave of a massive fermion in a gravitational field had never been experimentally confirmed before.\n\nIn 1999, the diffraction of C fullerenes by researchers from the University of Vienna was reported. Fullerenes are comparatively large and massive objects, having an atomic mass of about 720 u. The de Broglie wavelength of the incident beam was about 2.5 pm, whereas the diameter of the molecule is about 1 nm, about 400 times larger. In 2012, these far-field diffraction experiments could be extended to phthalocyanine molecules and their heavier derivatives, which are composed of 58 and 114 atoms respectively. In these experiments the build-up of such interference patterns could be recorded in real time and with single molecule sensitivity.\n\nIn 2003, the Vienna group also demonstrated the wave nature of tetraphenylporphyrin—a flat biodye with an extension of about 2 nm and a mass of 614 u. For this demonstration they employed a near-field Talbot Lau interferometer. In the same interferometer they also found interference fringes for CF, a fluorinated buckyball with a mass of about 1600 u, composed of 108 atoms. Large molecules are already so complex that they give experimental access to some aspects of the quantum-classical interface, i.e., to certain decoherence mechanisms. In 2011, the interference of molecules as heavy as 6910 u could be demonstrated in a Kapitza–Dirac–Talbot–Lau interferometer. In 2013, the interference of molecules beyond 10,000 u has been demonstrated.\n\nWhether objects heavier than the Planck mass (about the weight of a large bacterium) have a de Broglie wavelength is theoretically unclear and experimentally unreachable; above the Planck mass a particle's Compton wavelength would be smaller than the Planck length and its own Schwarzschild radius, a scale at which current theories of physics may break down or need to be replaced by more general ones.\n\nRecently Couder, Fort, \"et al.\" showed that we can use macroscopic oil droplets on a vibrating surface as a model of wave–particle duality—localized droplet creates periodical waves around and interaction with them leads to quantum-like phenomena: interference in double-slit experiment, unpredictable tunneling (depending in complicated way on practically hidden state of field), orbit quantization (that particle has to 'find a resonance' with field perturbations it creates—after one orbit, its internal phase has to return to the initial state) and Zeeman effect.\n\nWave–particle duality is deeply embedded into the foundations of quantum mechanics. In the formalism of the theory, all the information about a particle is encoded in its wave function, a complex-valued function roughly analogous to the amplitude of a wave at each point in space. This function evolves according to Schrödinger equation. For particles with mass this equation has solutions that follow the form of the wave equation. Propagation of such waves leads to wave-like phenomena such as interference and diffraction. Particles without mass, like photons, have no solutions of the Schrödinger equation so have another wave.\n\nThe particle-like behavior is most evident due to phenomena associated with measurement in quantum mechanics. Upon measuring the location of the particle, the particle will be forced into a more localized state as given by the uncertainty principle. When viewed through this formalism, the measurement of the wave function will randomly lead to wave function collapse, or rather quantum decoherence, to a sharply peaked function at some location. For particles with mass the likelihood of detecting the particle at any particular location is equal to the squared amplitude of the wave function there. The measurement will return a well-defined position,and subject to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. It is important to note that a measurement is only a particular type of interaction where some data is recorded and the measured quantity is forced into a particular quantum state. The act of measurement is therefore not fundamentally different from any other interaction.\n\nFollowing the development of quantum field theory the ambiguity disappeared. The field permits solutions that follow the wave equation, which are referred to as the wave functions. The term particle is used to label the irreducible representations of the Lorentz group that are permitted by the field. An interaction as in a Feynman diagram is accepted as a calculationally convenient approximation where the outgoing legs are known to be simplifications of the propagation and the internal lines are for some order in an expansion of the field interaction. Since the field is non-local and quantized, the phenomena which previously were thought of as paradoxes are explained. Within the limits of the wave-particle duality the quantum field theory gives the same results.\n\nThere are two ways to visualize the wave-particle behaviour: by the \"standard model\", described below; and by the Broglie–Bohm model, where no duality is perceived.\n\nBelow is an illustration of wave–particle duality as it relates to De Broglie's hypothesis and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (above), in terms of the position and momentum space wavefunctions for one spinless particle with mass in one dimension. These wavefunctions are Fourier transforms of each other.\n\nThe more localized the position-space wavefunction, the more likely the particle is to be found with the position coordinates in that region, and correspondingly the momentum-space wavefunction is less localized so the possible momentum components the particle could have are more widespread.\n\nConversely the more localized the momentum-space wavefunction, the more likely the particle is to be found with those values of momentum components in that region, and correspondingly the less localized the position-space wavefunction, so the position coordinates the particle could occupy are more widespread.\n\nWave–particle duality is an ongoing conundrum in modern physics. Most physicists accept wave-particle duality as the best explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena; however, it is not without controversy. Alternative views are also presented here. These views are not generally accepted by mainstream physics, but serve as a basis for valuable discussion within the community.\n\nThe pilot wave model, originally developed by Louis de Broglie and further developed by David Bohm into the hidden variable theory proposes that there is no duality, but rather a system exhibits both particle properties and wave properties simultaneously, and particles are guided, in a deterministic fashion, by the pilot wave (or its \"quantum potential\") which will direct them to areas of constructive interference in preference to areas of destructive interference. This idea is held by a significant minority within the physics community.\n\nAt least one physicist considers the \"wave-duality\" as not being an incomprehensible mystery. L.E. Ballentine, \"Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development\", p. 4, explains:\n\nWhen first discovered, particle diffraction was a source of great puzzlement. Are \"particles\" really \"waves?\" In the early experiments, the diffraction patterns were detected holistically by means of a photographic plate, which could not detect individual particles. As a result, the notion grew that particle and wave properties were mutually incompatible, or complementary, in the sense that different measurement apparatuses would be required to observe them. That idea, however, was only an unfortunate generalization from a technological limitation. Today it is possible to detect the arrival of individual electrons, and to see the diffraction pattern emerge as a statistical pattern made up of many small spots (Tonomura et al., 1989). Evidently, quantum particles are indeed particles, but whose behaviour is very different from classical physics would have us to expect. \n\nThe Afshar experiment (2007) may suggest that it is possible to simultaneously observe both wave and particle properties of photons. This claim is, however, disputed by other scientists.\n\nCarver Mead, an American scientist and professor at Caltech, proposes that the duality can be replaced by a \"wave-only\" view. In his book \"Collective Electrodynamics: Quantum Foundations of Electromagnetism\" (2000), Mead purports to analyze the behavior of electrons and photons purely in terms of electron wave functions, and attributes the apparent particle-like behavior to quantization effects and eigenstates. According to reviewer David Haddon:\n\nMead has cut the Gordian knot of quantum complementarity. He claims that atoms, with their neutrons, protons, and electrons, are not particles at all but pure waves of matter. Mead cites as the gross evidence of the exclusively wave nature of both light and matter the discovery between 1933 and 1996 of ten examples of pure wave phenomena, including the ubiquitous laser of CD players, the self-propagating electrical currents of superconductors, and the Bose–Einstein condensate of atoms.\n\nAlbert Einstein, who, in his search for a Unified Field Theory, did not accept wave-particle duality, wrote:\n\nThis double nature of radiation (and of material corpuscles) ... has been interpreted by quantum-mechanics in an ingenious and amazingly successful fashion. This interpretation ... appears to me as only a temporary way out...\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is sometimes presented as a waves-only theory, including by its originator, Hugh Everett who referred to MWI as \"the wave interpretation\".\n\nThe \"\" of R. Horodecki relates the particle to wave. The hypothesis implies that a massive particle is an intrinsically spatially, as well as temporally extended, wave phenomenon by a nonlinear law.\n\nThe ' considers collapse and measurement as two independent physical processes. Collapse occurs when two wavepackets spatially overlap and satisfy a mathemetical criterion, which depends on the parameters of both wavepackets. It is a contraction to the overlap volume. In a measurement apparatus one of the two wavepackets is one of the atomic clusters, which constitute the apparatus, and the wavepackets collapse to at most the volume of such a cluster. This mimics the action of a point particle.\n\nStill in the days of the old quantum theory, a pre-quantum-mechanical version of wave–particle duality was pioneered by William Duane, and developed by others including Alfred Landé. Duane explained diffraction of x-rays by a crystal in terms solely of their particle aspect. The deflection of the trajectory of each diffracted photon was explained as due to quantized momentum transfer from the spatially regular structure of the diffracting crystal.\n\nIt has been argued that there are never exact particles or waves, but only some compromise or intermediate between them. For this reason, in 1928 Arthur Eddington coined the name \"wavicle\" to describe the objects although it is not regularly used today. One consideration\nis that zero-dimensional mathematical points cannot be observed. Another is that the formal representation of such points, the Dirac delta function is unphysical, because it cannot be normalized. Parallel arguments apply to pure wave states. Roger Penrose states:\n\n\"Such 'position states' are idealized wavefunctions in the opposite sense from the momentum states. Whereas the momentum states are infinitely spread out, the position states are infinitely concentrated. Neither is normalizable [...].\"\nRelational quantum mechanics has been developed as a point of view that regards the event of particle detection as having established a relationship between the quantized field and the detector. The inherent ambiguity associated with applying Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is consequently avoided; hence there is no wave-particle duality.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to draw a line separating wave–particle duality from the rest of quantum mechanics, it is nevertheless possible to list some applications of this basic idea.\n\n\n"}

It is similar to the liar paradox. Unlike the liar paradox, which uses a single sentence, this paradox uses an infinite list of sentences, each referring to sentences occurring further down the list. Analysis of the list shows there is no consistent way to assign truth values to any of its members. Since everything on the list refers only to later sentences, Yablo claims his paradox is \"not in \"any\" way circular.\" However, Graham Priest disputes this.\n\nConsider the following infinite set of sentences:\n\n\nAssume there is an \"n\" such that \"S\" is true. Then \"S\" is not true, so there is some \"k\" > \"n\" + 1 such that \"S\" is true. But \"S\" is not true because \"S\" is true and \"k\" > \"n\". Assuming \"S\" to be true implies a contradiction: some later \"S\" is both true and not true. So our assumption is absurd and we must conclude that for each \"i\", the sentence \"S\" is not true. But if each \"S\" is not true, then given that each attributes untruth to later sentences, they are all true. So we have the paradox that each sentence in Yablo's list is true and not true.\n\n"}

He finished his studies in 1899 and, too short sighted to be a painter, turned to writing. His poetry was first published in \"Der yud\" (Warsaw) in 1901 and from then on his poems, satires, drama and children's stories appeared in Yiddish publications throughout Europe and North America.\n\nBetween 1906 and 1910 he travelled to the United States where he started the humorous journal \"Der kibitser\" (continued for two decades under the title \"Der Groyser Kundes\"). Moving to Warsaw in 1911 he wrote for \"Der moment\", editing its humour pages, \"Der krumer spiegel\", or \"The Crooked Mirror\". He spent World War I in Ukraine, mainly in Kiev and Odessa. In the early twenties, he adapted several works of German poet Wilhelm Busch.\n\nWhen the Warsaw cabaret Azazel opened in 1925, Der Tunkeler’s writings were part of the repertoire; his works were staged in Łódź and the Warsaw cabaret theater \"Sambatyon\" (which opened in 1927) as well.\n\nIn 1931 he visited what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. The outbreak of World War II found him in Belgium from which he escaped into France only to be arrested by the Vichy authorities. Escaping in 1941 he managed to find his way to the US once more, where he wrote for the major New York Yiddish daily \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" despite failing health. He died there in 1949.\n\nThroughout his life, numerous collections of his work were published in Warsaw, Kiev and New York. He is remembered as one of the Yiddish language's outstanding humorists to this day.\n\nPublished by \"Roman Tunkel\",\ndistant relatives of Tunkeler.\nEach statement of article is supported by photo-copy of corresponding document.\nMore detailed and accurate Russian Version of \"Дер Тункелер\" biography located at:\n\n1878 \"Iosel Tunkel\" is born in Babruysk.

He wanders from city to city pawning his stories and returns occasionally to Babruysk. Publishes his first poems in Joseph Luria's Yiddish newspaper Der Yud (The Jew).\n\n1906-1910 Travels to the United States and lives in New York. Founds two successful and long-lasting humor magazines - Der Kibbitzer (The Kibbitzer) and Di Groyser Kundes (The Big Stick).\n\n1910 Returns to Babruysk due to family emergency\n\n1911 Moved to Warsaw. Becomes a regular contributor to the magazine Der Moment. Starts using the pseudonyms \"Khoshekh\" and \"Der Tunkeler\". Eventually \"Iosef Tunkel\" becomes the editor of the weekly humor supplement called Der Kromer Shpigel (The Bent Mirror).\n\n1914-1918 During World War I, \"Iosef Tunkel\" returns to Babruysk and from there to Kiev and Odessa where he publishes several short works. Returns to independent Poland after the war. Returns to Der Moment, while occasionally writing for other newspapers such as Der Haynt and the Folkszeitung (People's Paper) under the pseudonym Androginus.\n\n1920s Publishes numerous books, plays, feuilletons, parodies and humorous articles. Often personally acts out his works on stage as he travels around the country. Travels to Israel. Is feted by the Hebrew Writers Union and Khaim Nakhman Bialik, who declares himself as a great admirer of \"Der Tunkeler's\" works. He subsequently writes his first travel narrative based on his experiences in the Holy Land.\n\n1932–33 \"Iosef Tunkel\" travels to the United States to visit his brothers and old friends as well as to gather material for a travel narrative. He stays in Springfield where his brother Alex and sister-in-law Rose live.\n\n1934? Travels to the Soviet Union to gather material for a subsequently published travel narrative. Lives in Paris for some time.\n\n1939 Travels to Belgium to collect material for another travel narrative when the Germans invade Poland and World War II breaks out. Illegally crosses the border into France with a group of Jewish refugees. Due to his lame leg, he is captured by the French police and sent to a detention center for foreign Jews in Strasbourg. In the camp, he befriends the Parisian novelist W. Wowiorka. Miraculously escapes the camp and somehow finds his way to the United States in April 1941. He resides permanently in New York and quickly finds employment with Der Forverts, the New York Yiddish daily newspaper.\n1943 Publishes the autobiographical work Goles: Ksovim von a Flichtling (Exile - The Writings of an Exile) about his experiences in Belgium and France in an attempt to shed light on the plight of European Jewry.\n\n1948 \"Tunkel\" publishes his last book \"Der Groyser Genits Oder a Nudner Tag in Nyu York\" (\"The Great Genius or an Annoying Day in New York\"). His last work of literature is an article for the Lithuanian Yizkor Book Lite \"The Chapter of Vilna in my Life\" which is published posthumously in 1951.
