Her grandfather R. Balasubramaniam was an actor who inspired Anuradha to become a writer. Anuradha started her career as an artist before making several unsuccessful attempts to get a job with popular magazines. This prompted her to join \"Mangai\", a Tamil magazine after the editor found her writings very interesting. Anuradha's literary career started in 1977 while working for the magazine.\n\nApart from her literary contributions, she was well known for her \"anti-divorce counselling\" work. In a career that spanned over 30 years, Anuradha wrote nearly 800 novels and 1,230 short stories. Her works were mainly centered on family and everyday happenings. One of her early works \"Sirai\", won a gold medal for the best short story from \"Ananda Vikatan\". It was adapted into a film of the same name. Following this, her other novels \"Kootu Puzhukkal\", \"Oru Malarin Payanam\" and \"Oru Veedu Iruvasal\" were adapted into films in various languages such as Tamil, Telugu and Kannada. \"Oru Veedu Iru Vasal\", directed by Balachander won the National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues in 1991. The 1988 Telugu film \"Oka Baarya Katha\" based on her work won five Nandi Awards.

The term \"A-roll\" referring to the main footage has fallen out of usage.\n\nFilms and videos may cut away from the main story to show related scenery or action. Establishing shots may be used to show the audience the context of the story. These secondary images are often presented without sound, as the sound from the primary footage is expected to continue while the other images are shown. The various shots presented without sound are called \"B-roll\".\n\nB-roll may be shot by smaller second unit crews, since there is no need for sound. In film, smaller MOS cameras may be used for greater portability and ease of setup. In electronic news-gathering (ENG) and documentary film projects, B-roll footage is often shot after the main interview is shot, to provide supporting scenes for what was said by the interview subject. In a docudrama project, B-roll may refer to dramatic re-enactment scenes staged by the producer and performed by actors, to be used as cutaway shots.\n\nB-roll footage may be added to or drawn from a stock footage library.\n\nThe term \"B-roll\" originates from a particular solution to the problem of visible splices in the narrow film stock used in 16 mm film. 35 mm film was wide enough to hide splices, but 16 mm film revealed the splices as flaws in the picture. To avoid this problem, the intended shots were spliced to opaque black leader, with the black leader hiding the splice. Two sequences of shots were assembled, the odd-numbered shots on the A-roll, and the even-numbered shots on the B-roll, such that all of the shots on one roll were matched by black leader on the other roll, in a checkerboard pattern (an alternate name for the process was \"checkerboard printing\".) Unexposed 16 mm raw print stock was exposed twice, once to the A-roll, then it was exposed again to the B-roll.\n\nUntil the mid-1970s, ENG teams shot both main A-roll and secondary B-roll footage on 16 mm film. Sound was integrated onto the film by way of a magnetic stripe at the edge of the film. The A-roll and B-roll scenes, shot at 24 frames per second, were converted to the television frame rate of 30 fps using a telecine system consisting of two film projectors, one showing the main A-roll footage and the other showing the B-roll. The sound from the A-roll footage was used, or sound from narration or voiceover, while MOS images from the B-roll were intercut as desired.\n\nIn the 1980s, the term \"B-roll\" was adopted for linear video editing using at least two video tape machines. Traditionally, the tape decks in an edit suite were labeled by letter, with the 'A' deck being the one containing the main tape upon which the main action material was shot. The 'B' deck was used to run tapes that held additional footage such as establishing shots, cutaway shots, and any other supporting footage. The sound was usually taken from the A deck alone, so that the B deck provided video without sound. As linear editing systems were unable to dissolve between clips on the same tape, an edit decision list (EDL) was used to mark clips as \"A-roll\" and \"B-roll\" to indicate source machines.\n\n"}

On 4 February 2016 the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine confirmed the name change of the city by returning to the original one. The city serves as an administrative center of Bakhmut Raion although it does not belong to the raion. It is located on the Bakhmutka River about 89 km away from the administrative center of the Donetsk Oblast, Donetsk. Population: \n\nBakhmut was a capital of Slavo-Serbia, which was established by Austrian migrants from Serbia. In 1920–24, the city was an administrative center of Donets Governorate of the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nThere is evidence of prior settlement in 1556. However, officially it was founded in 1571 and named as Bakhmut fort after the river Bakhmutka (a tributary of the Seversky Donets) on which it is situated. The settlement initially began as a border point and was later turned into a fortification. The name derived from Tatar name Mahmud or Mahmet. In 1701, Peter I ordered to build a fort and rename the town from Bahmut to Bakhmut. The fort was completed in 1703. In 1704 Peter the Great issued a ukase permitting Cossacks to settle in Bakhmut.\n\nIn the autumn of 1705, a detachment of Cossacks headed by Ataman Kondraty Bulavin captured the Bakhmut salt mines, which later caused the town to be one of the centers of the Bulavin Rebellion, and held the city until March 7, 1708 when it was seized by government troops. From 1708 to April 22, 1725, Bakhmut is situated in the Azov Governorate, and on May 29, 1719 becomes the administrative center of Bakhmut Province within the governorate. From 1753 to 1764, it was a main city of the Slavo-Serbia territory inhabited by colonists from Serbia and elsewhere.\n\nIn 1783, Bakhmut received city status within the Yekaterinoslav province (Novorossiysk Governorate). During this time, in the city, there were 49 houses, five brick, candle, and soap factories. The city had about 150 shops, a hospital, and three schools: two private boarding schools for children of wealthy parents, and a Sunday school for children of workers. Bakhmut had a large shopping center. There twice a year, on July 12 (Day of the Apostles Peter and Paul) and September 21 (Day of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary), big fairs were conducted. The city's annual turnover was about 1 million rubles. On August 2, 1811, the city emblem was approved. In 1875, a water-system was installed.\n\nOn January 25, 1851, the city became a municipality, with Vasily I. Pershin as mayor. In 1876, within the Bakhmut Basin were discovered large deposits of rock salt, which was followed by a rapid increase in the numbers of mines, with salt productions reaching 12% nationwide. After the construction of a rail route Kharkov-Bakhmut-Popasnaya, there was enterprise for the production of alabaster, plaster, brick, tile, and soda ash. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the city developed metal-working. By 1900, the city had 76 small industrial enterprises, which employed 1,078 workers, as well as four salt mines, which employed 874 workers. In 1900, the streets became paved. By 1913, the population consisted of 28,000 people. There were two hospitals with 210 beds, four secondary and two vocational schools, six single-class schools, four parish schools, and a private library.\n\nIn April 1918 troops loyal to the Ukrainian People's Republic took control of Bakhmut.\n\nOn December 27, 1919, Soviet power is established within the city. In 1923, there were 36 enterprises, including a factory \"Victory of Labor\" (a former nail-spike factory), a factory \"Lightning\" that produced castings for agriculture, as well as brick, tile, and alabaster factories; mines \"Karl Liebknecht and Sverdlov\", \"Shevchenko\", and \"Bakhmut salt\"; and a shoe factory. From April 16, 1920 to August 1, 1925, Bakhmut is the administrative center of the Donetsk province.\n\nIn 1924 the city's name was changed from Bakhmut to Artemivsk, in honour of Artyom, a Russian Bolshevik (Communist) revolutionary figure who lived and worked in the city in the early years of the revolution. In 1938, Moskalenko is the First Secretary of the Municipal Committee of the CPU. In 1941, Vasily Panteleevich Prokopenko is First Secretary of the City Committee of the Communist Party. From October 31, 1941 to May 9, 1943, German troops occupied Artemivsk under the command of Von Zobel. Under occupation in 1941, Nikolai Mikhailovich Zhorov is Secretary of the underground City Party Committee.\n\nIn 1961, Kuzma Petrovich Golovko became First Secretary of City Party Committee, followed by Ivan Malyukin in 1966, Nikolai S. Tagan in 1976, and Yuri K. Smirnov from 1980 to 1983. From April 1990 to 1994, Alexei Reva was Chairman of City Council and was elected mayor in 1994.\n\nDuring the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, the militants of Donetsk People's Republic declared the city part of the republic by pro-Russian separatists. The city was eventually retaken by Ukrainian forces on 7 July 2014, along with Druzhkivka.\n\nOn 15 May 2015 President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a bill into law that started a six months period for the removal of communist monuments and the mandatory renaming of settlements with a name related to Communism.\n\nOn 23 September 2015 the city council voted for renaming the city back to Bakhmut (for - 31, against - 8, abstain - 3, did not vote - 3). The final decision was made by the Verkhovna Rada (Supreme Council of Ukraine) on 4 February 2016.\n\n\nAs of June 1, 2017 the population of Bakhmut was 75.9 thousand people.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian Census of 2001, the majority of residents are ethnic Ukrainians and speak Russian as a first language:\n\nSince 1951, the European Bakhmut Winery is located in the city. The Artyomsol salt mine is located in the suburb of Soledar, which contains the world's largest underground room. It is large enough that a hot air balloon has been floated inside, symphonies have been played before, and two professional soccer matches have been held at the same time. It is large enough to fit Notre Dame inside with room to spare.\n\nThe highways of Kharkiv-Rostov and Donetsk-Kiev run through Bakhmut. The towns of Chasiv Yar and Soledar are included in the Bakhmut municipality. The city has a public transport system consisting of a network of trolleybuses and buses.\n\nThere are 20 schools (11,600 students), 29 kindergartens (3500 children), 4 vocational schools (2,000 students), 2 technical schools (6,000 students), and several music schools.

He usually also held the position of Queen's or King's harbourmaster and was directly responsible for the captain's department, which among other things operated the yard craft.\n\nFrom the 1650s until the mid-nineteenth century the position was known as master attendant, and ranked immediately below that of Navy Commissioner. Occupants of the office were required to be \"skilful in all affairs requisite in the looking after, equipping and setting out of State ships\", for which they initially received an annual wage of between £90 and £100 plus accommodation. The office was often combined with that of harbourmaster, and existed until the second half of the 19th century, when occupants (in common with Royal Naval masters) began to be commissioned with the rank of staff captain. From the early twentieth century the equivalent appointment became staff captain (dockyard), then captain of the dockyard, and finally captain of the port from 1969.\n\nIn the United States, captain of the port (COTP) is a title held by a United States Coast Guard officer, usually the commander of a United States Coast Guard sector with the rank of captain (O-6). Captain of the port duties involve enforcing within their respective areas port safety and security and marine environmental protection regulations, including regulations for the protection and security of vessels, harbors, and waterfront facilities; anchorages; security zones; safety zones; regulated navigation areas; deepwater ports; water pollution; and ports and waterways safety. \n"}

{"id": "7649963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7649963", "title": "Communication accommodation theory", "text": "Communication accommodation theory\n\nCommunication accommodation theory (CAT) is a theory of communication developed by Howard Giles. This theory concerns \"(1) the behavioral changes that people make to attune their communication to their partner, and (2) the extent to which people perceive their partner as appropriately attuning to them.\" This theory is concerned with the links between language, context, and identity. It focuses on both the intergroup and interpersonal factors that lead to accommodation, as well as the ways that power, macro and micro-context concerns affect communication behaviors.\n\n\"Communication accommodation theorists focus on the patterns of convergence and divergence of communication behaviors, particularly as they relate to people’s goals for social approval, communication efficiency, and identity\". \"Convergence\" refers to strategies through which individuals adapt to each other's communicative behaviors to reduce these social differences. Meanwhile, \"divergence\" refers to the instances in which individuals accentuate the speech and non-verbal differences between themselves and their interlocutors. Sometimes when individuals try to engage in convergence they can also end up over-accommodating, and despite their good intentions their convergence can be seen as condescending.\n\nThe communication accommodation theory was developed by Howard Giles, professor of Communication at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The speech accommodation theory was developed to demonstrate all of the value of social psychological concepts to understanding the dynamics of speech. It sought to explain \"... the motivations underlying certain shifts in people's speech styles during social encounters and some of the social consequences arising from them.\"Particularly, it focused on the cognitive and affective processes underlying individuals' convergence and divergence through speech. The communication accommodation theory has broadened this theory to include not only speech but also the \"non-verbal and discursive dimensions of social interaction\". CAT has also created a different perspective from other research in language and social interaction—and communication more generally—that focuses on either interpersonal or intergroup communication.\n\nLike speech accommodation theory, communication accommodation theory continues to draw from social psychology, particularly from four main socio-psychology theories: similarity-attraction, social exchange, causal attribution and intergroup distinctiveness. These theories help to explain why speakers seek to converge or diverge from the language, dialect, accent and behavior of their interlocutors. CAT also relies heavily in social identity theory. This latter theory argues that a person's self-concept comprises a personal identity and a social identity, and that this social identity is based in comparisons people make between in-groups (groups they belong to) and out-groups (groups they do not belong to). According to social identity theory, people strive to maintain a positive social identity by either joining groups where they feel more comfortable or making a more positive experience of belonging to the groups they already belong to. Since speech is a way to express group membership, people adopt convergence or divergence in communication to \"signal a salient group distinctiveness, so as to reinforce a social identity\". Communication accommodation thus, becomes a tool to emphasize group distinctiveness in a positive way, and strengthen the individual's social identity. There are four main socio-psychological theories:\n\nThe similarity-attraction theory posits that \"The more similar our attitudes and beliefs are to those of others, the more likely it is for them to be attracted to us.\" Convergence through verbal and non-verbal communication is one of the mechanisms that we can use to become more similar to others, increasing their attraction towards us. For this reason, it can be said that one of the factors that leads individuals to use convergence is a desire to obtain social approval from their interlocutor. It could hence be concluded that \"the greater one's need for social approval, the greater will be one's tendency to converge\". Natalé (1975), for instance, has found that speakers with high needs for approval converge more to another's vocal intensity and pause length than those with low needs for approval. An individual on the receiving end of high level of accommodation is likely to develop a greater sense of self-esteem and satisfaction than being a receiver of low accommodation.\n\nThe social exchange process theory \"... states that prior to acting, we attempt to assess the rewards and costs of alternate courses of action\", and that we tend to choose whatever course of action will bring greater rewards and less costs. The Social Exchange Theory is a theory that looks at how people evaluate their relationships. Throughout the process of evaluating relationships, individuals want to feel as if they are receiving more from the relationship than they are expending within the relationship. In other words, people like to be in relationships where the rewards outweigh the costs. Although most often convergence can bring forth rewards, there are some occasions when it can also bring forth costs such as \"increased effort to converge, a loss of perceived integrity and personal (and sometimes group) identity\". Hence, when choosing whether or not to use convergence, people assess these costs and rewards.\n\nThe causal attribution theory \"[s]uggests that we interpret other people's behavior, and evaluate the individual themselves, in terms of the motivations and intentions that we attribute as the cause of their behavior\" It applies to convergence in that convergence might be viewed positively or negatively depending on the causes we attribute to it: \"Although interpersonal convergence is generally favorably received, and non-convergence generally unfavorably received, the extent to which this holds true will undoubtedly be influenced by the listeners attributions of the speaker's intent.\" Giles and Smith provide the example of an experiment that they conducted amongst French and English speaking Canadians to illustrate this. In this experiment, when individuals believed that the person from the different group used language convergence to reduce cultural barriers, they evaluated it more positively than when they attributed it to the pressures of the situation. \"When French Canadian listeners attributed an English Canadian's convergence to French as due to his desire to break down cultural barriers, the shift was viewed favorably. However, when this same behavior was attributed to pressures in the situation forcing the other to converge, positive feelings were not so strongly evoked.\"\n\nThe process of intergroup distinctiveness, as theorized by Tajfel argues, \"... when members of different groups are in contact, they compare themselves on dimensions that are important to them, such as personal attributes, abilities, material possessions and so forth.\" In these \"intergroup social comparisons\" individuals seek to find ways to make themselves positively distinct from the out-group to enhance their social identity. Because speech style and language is an important factor in defining social groups, divergence in speech style or language is often used to maintain intergroup distinctiveness and differentiate from the out-group, especially when group membership is a salient issue or the individual's identity and group membership is being threatened.\n\nMany of the principles and concepts from social identity theory are also applicable to communication accommodation theory. Under the influence of social psychology, especially social identity theory, communication accommodation theory are guided by mainly four assumptions.\n\n\nThe first assumption indicates that people bring their past experience to conversations. Therefore, communication is influenced by situational conditions and initial reactions but also the \"social-historical context in which the interaction is embedded\". People's attitudes and beliefs, derived from those factors, determine the extent to which they are willing to accommodate in a conversation. The more similarities that they share with each other, the more likely for them to accommodate.\n\nThe second assumption is concerned with how people perceive and evaluate a conversation. Perception is '\"the process of attending to and interpreting a message'\", and evaluation is the \"process of judging a conversation\". Someone who enters a conversation usually first observes what takes place and then decides whether he should adjust to fit in. However, the decision about accommodation is not always necessary. If two strangers meet, they may have a random small talk and simply say goodbye. Then, neither of them is likely to evaluate the conversation since they have little chance of meeting again.\n\nThe importance of language and behavior is illustrated in the third assumption since they are indicators of social status and group belongings. When two people who speak different languages try to have a conversation, the language used is more likely to be the one used by the higher status person. That idea of \"salient social membership\" negotiation is illustrated well during an interview as the interviewee usually makes all efforts to identify with the interviewer by accommodating the way that is spoken and behaved to raise the chance of getting the job.\n\nThe last assumption puts emphasis on social appropriateness and norms. Here, norms are defined as \" expectations of behaviors that individuals feel should or should not occur in a conversation\". Those expectations give guidance to people's behaviors, helping them to figure out the appropriate way to accommodate. Most of the time, the accommodation made according to those norms are perceived socially appropriate. For instance, when a young person talks to the seniors in the family, he should avoid using jargons among his generation to show respect and to communicate more smoothly.\n\nConvergence refers to the process through which an individual shifts speech patterns in interaction so that they more closely resemble the speech patterns of speech partners. People can converge through many features of communication such as their use of language, their \"pronunciation, pause and utterance lengths, vocal intensities, non verbal behaviors, and intimacy of self disclosures\"(Giles and Smith, 1979, 46), but they do not necessarily have to converge simultaneously at all of these levels. In fact, people can both converge at some levels and diverge through others at the same time. People use convergence based on their perceptions of others, as well as what they are able to infer about them and their backgrounds. Attraction (likability, charisma, credibility), also triggers convergence. As Turner and West note, \"When communicators are attracted to others they will converge in their conversations.\" On the other hand, as the similarity attraction theory highlights, when people have similar beliefs, personality and behaviors they tend to be more attracted towards each other. To achieve a \"desired social distance\"(Pardo, 2016), people use language to converge more towards a conversational partner they are attracted to. The desire to make social interaction flow subsequently results in convergence. Many people tend to use converge with one another because they want to feel a sense of fitting in and experience social approval to the people around them. Thus, when one individual shifts speech and non-verbal behaviors in order to assimilate to the other it can result in a more favorable appraisal of him, that is: when convergence is perceived positively it is likely to enhance both the conversation and the attraction between the listener and the speaker. For this reason it could be said that convergence reflects \"an individual's desire for social approval\" from his interlocutor, and that the greater the individual's need for social approval, the more likely he or she is to converge. Besides attraction, other factors that \"influence the intensity of this\" need of approval and hence the level of convergence \"include the probability of future interactions, the social status of the addressee, and interpersonal variability for need of social approval\". Other factors that determine whether and to what extent individuals converge in interaction are their relational history, social norms and power variables. Because individuals are more likely to converge to the individual with the higher status it is likely that the speech in a conversation will reflect the speech of the individual with the higher status. Converging also increases the effectiveness of communication, which in turn lowers uncertainty, interpersonal anxiety, and increases mutual understanding. This is another factor that motivates people to converge.\n\nDivergence is a linguistic strategy whereby a member of a speech community accentuates the linguistic differences between himself and his interlocutor. \"Given that communication features are often core dimensions of what it is to be a member of a group, divergence can be regarded as a very important tactic of displaying a valued distinctiveness from the other.\" This helps to sustain a positive image of one's in-group and hence to strengthen one's social identity. Divergence is commonly used to establish dominance or power in an interaction. For example, if a recent college graduate becomes a professor, they might be teaching students who are around the same age as them. Therefore, it is important for the professor to communicate in a way that the students are aware the professor has more authority than them. Another case where there is a need for divergence are when professionals are with clients. In a 2001 study, doctors and patients discussed musculoskeletal disorders and it was observed that there were miscommunications that occurred because the participants chose to converge during the communication rather than to accentuate their position differences. Patients in the study felt more comfortable discussing their problems because they felt \"positive about their doctor’s capacity to understand them\". Communicating in a fashion to make speech different can also be interpreted as a sign of dislike towards a person or group. For example, \"when you run into a disliked classmate from high school, your vocal pattern becomes more different from that classmate's.\" This represents the act of divergence because you are purposely changing your speech to not sound like that person.\n\nFurther research conducted by Gallois et al. in 1995 has expanded the theory to include 17 propositions that influence these processes of convergence and divergence. They are categorized into four main components: the \"sociohistorical context\", \"the communicators' accommodative orientation\", the \"immediate situation\" and \"evaluation and future intentions\". These components are essential to Communication accommodation Theory and affect the course and outcome of intercultural conversations.\n\nThe sociohistorical context refers to ways that past interactions between groups the communicators belong to influence the communication behaviors of the communicators. It includes \"the relations between the groups having contact and the social norms regarding contact\". These relations between the different groups the communicators belong to influence the communicators' behavior. Socio-historical factors that influence communicators include political or historical relations between nations, and different religious or ideological views of the two groups participating in the conversation.\n\nAccommodative orientation refers to the communicator's \"... tendencies to perceive encounters with out group members in interpersonal terms, intergroup terms, or a combination of the two\". There are three factors that are crucial to accommodative orientations: (1) \"intrapersonal factors\" (e.g. personality of the speakers), (2) \"intergroup factors\" (e.g. communicators' feelings toward outgroups), and (3) \"initial orientations\" (e.g., perceived potential for conflict). Issues that influence this last factor include: collectivistic culture context or whether the culture is collectivistic or individualistic; distressing history of interaction, the possible tensions that exist between groups due to past interactions; stereotypes; norms for treatment of groups; and high group solidarity/ high group dependence, how dependent the person's self-worth is in the group.\n\nThe immediate situation refers to the moment when the actual communication takes place. It is shaped by five interrelated aspects: (1) \"sociopsychological states\", (2) \"goals and addressee focus\" (e.g., motivations and goals for the encounter), (3) \"sociolinguistic strategies\" (e.g., convergence or divergence), (4) \"behavior and tactics\" (e.g., topic, accent) and (5) \"labeling and attributions\".\n\nThis aspect deals with how communicators perceive their conversational partners' behavior and its effects on future encounters between the two groups. Positively rated conversations will most likely lead to further communication between the interlocutors and other members of their respective groups.\n\nIn 1991, Giles, Coupland, and Coupland expressed the belief that a \"more qualitative perspective\" would be necessary to get more diverse and clarifying explanations of the behaviors presented within varying contexts. They referred to this as \"the applied perspective\" that showed accommodation theory as a vital part of day-to-day activity as opposed to solely being a theoretical construct. They sought to \"demonstrate how the core concepts and relationships invoked by accommodation theory are available for addressing altogether pragmatic concerns\". For Giles, Coupland, and Coupland, these \"pragmatic concerns\" were extremely varied in nature.\n\nOne of these \"pragmatic concerns\" included understanding the relational issues that present themselves in the medical and clinical fields, such as the relational \"alternatives, development, difficulties, and outcomes\" that affected the patients' contentment with their medical interactions—and whether or not, through these interactions, they agreed with and implemented said health care regimens. Another of these situations involved the potential options in a legal arena. The way that the judges, plaintiffs, and defendants accommodated themselves to both the situation and the jury could manipulate the jury's acceptance or rejection of the defendant, and could, thus, control the outcome of the case.\n\nCommunication accommodation theory was also found to have a place in media. In regards to radio broadcasting, the alliance of the audience with the broadcaster played an important part in both the ratings that the shows would receive and whether the show progressed or was cancelled.\n\nIn the area of jobs and employment, accommodation theory was believed to influence the satisfaction one has with his or her job and the productivity that that person possesses in said job through convergence with or divergence from the co-workers and their work environment.\n\nAccommodation theory also possessed practical applications in the development of learning a second language. This was seen when the student's education of and proficiency in said language was either assisted or hindered by accommodative measures. Giles, Coupland, and Coupland (1991) also addressed the part that accommodation theory plays in a situation they called \"language switching\", when bilingual individuals must decide which language they should speak when they are in an organizational environment with other bilingual individuals. This can be an incredibly important choice to make, especially in a business setting, because an incorrect judgment in this area of communication could unwittingly promote negative reactions between the two or more parties involved. In addition, accommodation theory was strongly intertwined with the way an immigrant accepts and is accepted by their host country. An instance of over-accommodation from the immigrating individual can unintentionally damage that person's sense of individuality while a strong divergence from the immigrating individual from their host culture can prompt the natives of the host country to react negatively to them because of the immigrating individual's use of divergence.\n\nThe final area of practical application, as presented by Giles, Coupland, and Coupland (1991), was that of accommodation theory's effect on the lives of people with disabilities. Accommodation theory was thought to either aid them by promoting them to \"fulfill their communicative and life potentials\", or by hindering them from reaching their full potential by focusing on the disability that made them different rather than the other characteristics that made them similar to their peers.\n\nDespite the fact that communication accommodation theory is theoretical, it has shown itself to be viable by its numerous practical applications.\n\nThe Communication Accommodation Theory has obtained scholarly criticism by the three scholars Judee Burgon, Leesa Dillman, and Lesa Stern. These scholars question the \"convergence-divergence frame... [and] they believe that conversations are too complex to be reduced simply to the processes of the Communication Accommodation theory. They also challenge the notion that people's accommodation can be explained by just the practice of [convergence-divergence]\". Questions asked by the scholars were: \"what occurs if people both converge and diverge in conversations, are there consequences to the speaker, the listener, is there an influence if race or ethnicity is played in the process?\". It causes conflicts between communicators because the theory relies too heavily on a rational way of communicating. Sometimes we as people do not have a rational way of thinking and this becomes a problem when communicating.\n\nThe Communication Accommodation theory focuses \"on the role of conversations in our lives\". It has been incorporated into \"the mass media (Bell, 1991), with families (Fox, 1999), with Chinese students (Hornsey and Gallois, 1998), with elderly (Harwood, 2002), on the job (McCroskey and Richmond, 2000), in interviews (Willemyns, Gallois, Callan, and Pittam, 1997), and even with messages left on telephone answering machines (Buzzanell, Burrell, Stafford, and Berkowitz, 1996)\". The theory tends to be heuristic because it is \"expansive enough to be complete, and has been supported by research from diverse authors\". \"The theory's core processes of convergence and divergence make it relatively easy to understand, underscoring the simplicity of the theory\".\n\nResearchers of communication accommodation theory who have been interested in conversations between the elderly and the young, actively apply this theory to analyze intergenerational communication situations. Since the aging of population is becoming a serious issue in current society, communication difficulties of older adults and issues like ageism should be addressed. According to mainstream sociolinguistic studies, age is regarded as a variable only to the extent that it may show patterns of dialectal variation within speech communities across time. However, the existence of potentially important generational differences relating to beliefs about talk, situational perceptions, interactional goals, and various language devices between the young and the elderly are all taken into account as empirical questions in their own right when using communication accommodation theory to explore intergenerational communication problems and improve effectiveness. Previous researchers have also developed models such as the communication predicament model of ageing, and the communication enhancement model of ageing, to point out numerous consequences brought by both negative and positive attitudes towards aging.\n\nEven though young people are more likely to perceive the old by multiple stereotypes, the elderly are negatively evaluated in most situations, resulting in a reduction of meaningful communication.To further illustrate this, Ryan \"et al\". devised a typology of four young-to-elderly language strategies in his research concerning psycho linguistic and social psychological components of communication with the elderly, addressing a problem for the elderly that they are vulnerable to the social and psychological circumstances of isolation, neglect, and negative stereotyping. However, it is not appropriate to see problematic intergenerational talk as a one-sided affair since both the young and the old can be responsible for miscommunication and unsuitable accommodation.\n\nThe first of these is characterized as over-accommodation due to physical or sensory handicaps, which happens when speakers talk to handicapped recipients, usually those with hearing impairment, and adapt their speech beyond the optimal level. This is also known as \"Elderspeak\", a form of baby talk in which a person addresses the elderly in an overly simple and sometimes patronizing way.\n\nThe second strategy is labelled as dependency-related over-accommodation, which refers to overbearing, excessively directive and disciplinary speech to the elderly. \"It was conjectured that this strategy is encoded as one of the means by which a younger person can control the relationship and induce the elderly individual to become dependent on the former\".\n\nAge-related divergence is the third strategy. This tenet proposes that young speakers may seek to amplify the distinctiveness of their own social group by purposefully acting in ways that differ from their stereotype of old speakers. Older speakers might be seen as in physical and mental decline; slowing down with age and unable to keep pace with the current social norms. These young speakers, attempting to differentiate themselves from this image, will talk faster, use fashionable colloquialism and slang, and express more \"modern\" ideas and values in their communication with seniors.\n\nThe fourth strategy is intergroup over-accommodation and it is considered one of the most pervasive of young-to-elderly language strategies. The \"simple perception of an addressee's social category membership being old – and, independently of a particular handicap (if any), considerations of dependency and in-group symbolization are sufficient to invoke negative physical, social, and psychological inferences for many younger people\".\n\nGiles has studied the interaction of young and elderly persons in business settings using communication accommodation as a theoretical framework. Findings demonstrated that elderly persons tend to be less accommodating than their younger counterparts. Findings also demonstrated that, for example, in business settings, one is much more likely to accommodate and converge to the language of a superior, such as a manager, than to someone with less or equal amount of superiority, such as a co-worker. While several other factors came into play, convergence, and divergence portions of this theory were used in interpreting and explain this phenomenon.\n\nThe prevalence of and consequences for ageism and ageist language in intergenerational interactions in health care contexts such as hospitals and long-term care facilities have also been discussed. Factors such as negative ageist stereotypes and unique features of the older adult patient-physician interaction can result in miscommunication between physicians and patients. Moreover, individuals are more likely to use patronizing language styles, to evaluate patronizing communication positively, and less likely to respond assertively to ageist language in hospital settings than in community dwellings. In the domain of mental health care for older individuals, research also suggests that the elderly are systematically disadvantaged when interacting with mental health professionals.\n\nSince communication accommodation theory applies to both interpersonal and inter-group communication one of the fields in which it has been most applied has been in intercultural communication. Within this field it has been applied to explain and analyze communication behaviors in a variety of situations, such as interactions between non-native and natives during second language acquisition processes, and interactions between inter-ethnic groups.\n\nStudies show the comparison of communication accommodation in foreign countries between tourists and locals. In countries with heavy tourism, many being Third World, it is common that the actual tourists have little to no competency in, or desire of having competency in the language and style of communication of the local natives. On the other hand, the country's local economy as well as the livelihood of its citizens, heavily depends on these tourists. Therefore, there is a great need to accommodate the communication styles of the tourists.\n\nThe input that non-native speakers (NNS) obtain from their interlocutors during second language acquisition is crucial in their process of language learning. For instance, as the similarity attraction theory predicts, non-native speakers (NNS) are more likely to converge towards the native speaker's (NS) language when they identify him or her as similar to themselves: \"When an NNS and an NS share important social identities, ethnic or not, the NNS will be more likely to converge towards the NS's language use\". In a study conducted by Young (1998) for instance, high proficiency Chinese English Language Second Speakers interviewed by individuals with a higher degree of social convergence in terms of ethnicity, sex, occupation, educational level, place of origin, and age were significantly more likely to converge to their interlocutor's standard English plural conjunction than those who were interviewed by subjects that differed more in terms of these social characteristics. Unlike previous studies that focussed mostly in ethnic solidarity to explain language variations in second language learners (Beebe and Zuengler, 1983), this later study proved that \"it is not interlocutor ethnicity alone that causes linguistic variation, but a collection of attributes (of which one is ethnicity) by which interlocutors assess their relative similarity to each other... providing clear support for the similarity-attraction aspect of CAT\".\n\nOn the other hand, like the inter-group distinctiveness theory argues, several studies have revealed that when second language learners feel their social identity is threatened due to patronizing behavior towards their ethnic group they are more likely to engage in divergence. In a study conducted by Zuengler (1982) amongst Spanish and Greek speakers learning English, subjects were asked both ethnically threatening and neutral questions by a native English speaker. Those subjects that answered the ethnic-threatening question in a more personal form were noted to decrease the \"native English-like pronunciations of the sounds\" in their answers. Similar results were obtained in a study conducted by Giles and Bourhis conducted in Wales. In this study Welshmen with strong ties to their nation and their language who were learning Welsh were asked questions about methods of second language acquisition. In this study the questions were asked by an English speaker with an RP-sounding accent \"...who at one point arrogantly challenged their reasons for what he called \"... a dying language which had a dismal future.\" In response to this question, which greatly threatened their identity and intergroup distinctiveness, the informants diverged considerably by strengthening their Welsh accents and using Welsh.\n\nNative language speakers frequently engage in \"foreign talk\" (FT) when interacting with second language learners. In this type of talk native speakers adopt features such as \"slower speech rates, shorter and simpler sentence, more question and question tags, greater pronunciation articulation\" amongst others. This is done to increase efficiency, especially when the native speakers perceive the non-native speakers as less competent communicators, or (as the similarity-attraction theory predicts) to increase attraction. Foreign talk often contains features that mirror the mistakes made by non-native speakers in order to make speech more similar, and hence \"NS may include ungrammatical features in their FT\". As predicted by the inter-group distinctiveness theory, native speakers might also choose to refrain from engaging in FT or might use divergence, whenever they wish to maintain group distinctiveness, either because they have a lower perception of the other group, they feel threatened by them, or they wish to display ethnocentricity.\n\nImmigrants tend to converge according to what they perceive to be the prototypical behaviors of their new group, or according to the norms that they infer make part of their new environment. Meanwhile, their new communities \"also may hold norms, about how immigrants do and/or should use the majority language\" and \"convergence that is perceived by members of the host community as inappropriate to the speaker's status, the relationship, or the norms of the situation, may be labelled as ingratiating, condescending or gauche\". This might lead to a negative appraisal of the immigrant speaker. For this reasons, Gallois and Callan (1991) suggest that it is important to teach immigrants about the norms that govern convergence in each community. Although other personal motives govern immigrant's linguistic choices later on, their expectations and the situational norms that they are able to perceive are what guide their linguistic choices when they are new to a culture.\n\nA research paper uses the basis of the Communication Accommodation Theory along with Intergroup Communication and relational Satisfaction to explain the perception of a family towards homosexuality and how family communication dynamics are impacted when one of the family member has a different sexual identity. In fact, the study was conducted to understand how to parent such a child and the consequences of disclosure on the communication in the family. Sexual identity can be a challenging discussion for a family and revealing one's preferred identity led to topic avoidance under intergroup anxiety and the relational satisfaction was negatively viewed. Such a constrained communication made the individuals feel that their relationship with the family member was less fulfilling and eventually less satisfying.\n\nAs communication accommodation theory explains \"the cognitions and motivations that underlie interactants' communication\" with context and identity salience, it's feasible to apply it to new media related settings. Even though research in this field is still at its early stage, interesting case studies have appeared in recent years.\nStudies have investigated possible accommodative tendencies of librarians when faced with cyberlanguage use by the patron through instant messaging technology. Since use of cyberlanguage in VRS (virtual reference services) conversations has been suggested as one possible way to strengthen patron relations, patrons who are satisfied with their interaction with a librarian who use cyberlanguage may be more willing to return. However, the result suggests that patron's use of cyberlanguage has no influence on a librarian's use of cyberlanguage and surprisingly convergence doesn't happen. Nevertheless, accommodation of communication styles do happen in other computer-mediated communication circumstances. In group brainstorming conversations, Chinese participants are likely to become as responsive as Americans when working in mixed-culture groups and more talkative when using lean medium. The use of new media provides users an opportunity to more quickly provide or gather information without new or additional disruption.\n\nGiles has also looked at the actions and attitudes in the public's interaction with police officers, using accommodation theory. Relational and identity aspects of this theory help to illustrate the interaction patterns that exist between the public and the police in the various situations in which these interaction take place. This study looked at both the accommodation patterns of the officers and the public with whom they were dealing.\n\nIn this case of policemen and accommodation, it is important for men and women of the force to find a stable balance between accommodating (displaying care, empathy, respect etc.,) and keeping a firm stance of authority. Studies show that the public believes policemen, overall, should work on being more community oriented and accommodating to all of its citizens, not only to reduce tension, anxiety, and stress, but to build trust and satisfaction between both parties. There are current, as well as up-and-coming community-based police programs to give citizens a more \"informal\", \"down to earth\", view of their commanding officers. However, even with all of these accommodations being made, it is necessary for there to remain an understanding of the higher power, so that in the case in life-threatening situations, men and women of the police force can continue to actively and effectively uphold society\n\nFrom November 2015 to April 2016, a study was conducted to observe the communication between pharmacists and patients during medication counseling sessions. This was conducted in order to understand what is occurring during these exchanges. \"Twelve pharmacists engaged four patients each for a total of 48 medication counselling interactions that took place\". During each session, the pharmacists were recorded by one of the main researchers, another pharmacist with no ties to the other pharmacists. In each recording, the main researcher (referred to as BC) specifically searched for five strategies of CAT: approximation, interpretability, discourse management, emotional expression and interpersonal control.\n\n\nUpon conclusion of this study, it was shown that most of the pharmacists used the five CAT strategies during their social exchanges with the patients; however, the presentations of discourse varied by pharmacist.\n\nIn Sonia S'hiri's \"Speak Arabic please!\": Tunisian Arabic Speakers' Linguistic Accommodation to Middle Easterners\" she describes how speakers of Tunisian Arabic converge to the \"Sharqi\" or \" Middle Eastern Arabic\" of their co-workers.\n\nOne of the many ways to divide the Arab world is between the West \"Maghreb\" and the East \"Sharq\". Though there is no official \"Sharqi Arabic\", the varieties usually associated with Sharqi Arabic are Egyptian, Levantine, and Persian Gulf/Iraqi Arabic. Due to Egypt's dominance of the media and arts, the \"Sharqi\" Arabic spoken in the region has come to be perceived by Tunisians, as \"lighter\", more poetic and artistic, more humorous, more romantic and even more beautiful than the local [Tunisian] variety. Again, because of its dominance in the media and the arts, Arabic speakers throughout the Arab world are much more familiar with \"Sharqi\" varieties than they are with \"Maghrebi\" varieties. A common yet incorrect belief about speech interactions in the Arab speaking world is that when speakers of different varieties of the language come into contact with one another, the default language for communication is Modern Standard Arabic (Fusha).\n\nIn her study conducted in London, S'hiri examined the social reasons for Tunisian Arabs to converge linguistically to speakers of \"Sharqi Arabic\". The data she found also gave ample evidence to show that code-switching into pure Fusha for communication is a misconception. S'hiri recorded five Tunisian Arabic speakers (M1, M2, W1, W2, and W3) who worked at two different broadcasting companies and found that they did indeed converge linguistically to their Sharqi co-workers. They did not however, resort solely to Fusha. S'hiri found that when interacting with speakers of \"Sharqi\" Arabic, her Tunisian informants used linguistic features and lexical items characteristic of the \"Sharqi\" variety, some English words, (instead of the French words often used in Tunisian Arabic speech) in addition to switching to Fusha. S'hiri found that many of her informants were proud of both their Tunisian variety of Arabic as well as their ability converge linguistically and even posits the idea of \"showing off\" as a goal of linguistic convergence\". Her findings lead to an interesting sort of paradox. Although the Tunisian Arabs abandon their own variety of the language, they do not experience a feeling of loss of identity, because the ability to code-switch, perceived as prestigious in their culture, makes part of their positive identity. Despite their inner feelings of pride for their own group, by accommodating to the Sharqi speakers the Tunisians are setting aside their ingoup identity in order to \"promote their extended ethnicity as members of an Arab nation instead of just as Tunisians\". In terms of accommodation theory, Tunisians in London can be seen as the \"ingroup\" trying to assimilate to the \"outgroup\".\n\nWhen her informants were asked why they had switched to the \"Sharqi\" variety, they all agreed it was psychologically motivating, because it allowed them to get closer to their interlocutors. M1 added that this allowed him to convey friendliness to his interlocutors, to reduce differences and avoid rejection. Informant W2 \"Found that using TA [Tunisian Arabic] is an obstacle to getting closer to people. She felt excluded especially at the beginning since Sharqis seemed to avoid her because they believed she would be difficult to understand\". W2 also \"Claims that the level of readiness of Sharqis to understand her determines whether she uses TA with them or not. She wants to avoid ridicule\".\n\n\n"}

He surpassed his contemporaries in literary ability.\nSome paleographers say that he was the most versatile forger of the nineteenth century.\n\nHe was born on the small Greek island of Symi, on the coast of the Aegean Sea in 1820 (or in 1824), and died in Egypt of leprosy.\n\nSimonides lived in the monasteries on Mount Athos between 1839 and 1841 and again in 1852, during which time he acquired some of the biblical manuscripts that he later sold. He produced a lot of manuscripts ascribed to Hellenistic and early Byzantine periods. He allegedly forged a number of documents and manuscripts and claimed they were the originals of the Gospel of Mark, as well as original manuscripts of poems of Homer. He sold some of these manuscripts to the King of Greece. Greek scholars exposed what some claimed to be forgeries quickly and he left Greece and traveled from country to country with his manuscripts.\nHe visited England between 1853 and 1855 and other European countries, and his literary activity was extraordinary. Some of his works were published in Moscow, Odessa, in England, and in Germany. He also wrote many other works which were never published.\n\nFrom 1843 until 1856 all over Europe he offered for sale manuscripts purporting to be of ancient origin.\nHe created \"a considerable sensation by producing quantities of Greek manuscripts professing to be of fabulous antiquity – such as a Homer in an almost prehistoric style of writing, a lost Egyptian historian, a copy of St. Matthew's Gospel on papyrus, written fifteen years after the Ascension (!), and other portions of the New Testament dating by him to the first century. These productions were later claimed to be forgeries.\n\nIn 1854 and 1855 Simonides tried unsuccessfully to sell some manuscripts for the British Museum and the Bodleian Library. Thomas Phillipps was a less critical purchaser and bought for the Phillips Library at Cheltenham some manuscripts. In 1855 he visited Berlin and Leipzig. He informed Wilhelm Dindorf that he owned a palimpsest of Uranius.\n\nOn 13 September 1862, in an article of \"The Guardian\", he claimed that he is the real author of the Codex Sinaiticus and that he wrote it in 1839. According to him it was \"the one poor work of his youth\". According to Simonides, he visited Sinai in 1852 and saw the codex. Henry Bradshaw, a scholar, didn't believe his claims.\n\nSimonides questioned many of official scientific positions accepted by scholars. He did not respect any scholars.\nHe interpreted Egyptian hieroglyphics in different ways than Champollion and other Egyptologists. He tried to prove that his method of interpreting Egyptian hieroglyphics was superior. He placed the death of Irenaeus at 292 (c. 130 – c. 200). Also, in many other complicated questions he had his own, usually controversial, point of view, but after ascribing the authorship of the Codex Sinaiticus to himself, the rest of his credibility was destroyed by the British press. \n\nIn 2006 a papyrus book-roll was exhibited at Turin which appeared to be part of Book II of the lost \"Geographical Descriptions\" of Artemidorus Ephesius. It was exhibited again in Berlin in 2008. It has been argued by Luciano Canfora that the manuscript is the work of Constantine Simonides. Richard Janko also believes that the roll is a forgery.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5887241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5887241", "title": "Crime family", "text": "Crime family\n\nA crime family is a unit of an organized crime syndicate, particularly the Mafia (both in Sicily and in the United States), often operating within a specific geographic territory. In its strictest sense, a \"family\" (or \"clan\") is a criminal gang, operating either on a unitary basis or as an organized collection of smaller gangs (e.g., \"cells\", \"factions\", \"crews\", etc.). In turn, a family can be a sole \"enterprise\", or part of a larger syndicate or cartel.\n\nThe origins of the term come from the Sicilian Mafia. In the Sicilian language, the word \"cosca\", which literally translates into \"artichoke\" (a vegetable whose multiple layers surround and protect a vital core), is also used for \"clan\". In the early days of the Mafia, loose groups of bandits organized themselves into associations that over time became more organized, and they adopted the term based on both of its meanings.\n\nAs the Mafia was imported into the United States in the late 19th century, the English translation of the word \"cosca\" was more at \"clan\" or \"family\".\n\nThe term can be a point of confusion, especially in popular culture and Hollywood, because in the truest sense, crime families are not necessarily blood families who happen to be involved in criminal activity, and not necessarily based on blood relationships. In Sicily and America, most Mafia bosses are not related to their predecessors. Films like \"The Godfather\" and a spate of late-1980s \"Mafia princess\" television movies underscore this confusion.\n\nIt can further be speculated that the Mafia was simply emulating, to a certain degree, a more medieval order in which a noble family would more or less serve as the power in a local village, in a sort of inverted hacienda culture.\n\nThe Calabrian \"'Ndrangheta\" is, however, purported to be organized along familial lines.\n\nNevertheless, the term stuck, both in the minds of popular culture as well as the national law enforcement community, and eventually began to be used to describe individual units of not only Sicilian gangsters, but those whose origins lie in other parts of Italy (e.g., the aforementioned \"'Ndrangheta\", the Neapolitan \"Camorra\", the Apulian \"Sacra Corona Unita\", etc.). Indeed, the \"family\" mystique is to such a great degree that in the late 1990s, after many Camorra leaders were imprisoned during a large-scale crackdown in Naples, many of their wives, girlfriends, daughters, and even mothers took temporary control of their gangs, in a widespread phenomenon of Camorra \"godmothers\".\n\nSometimes the term is used to describe distinct units of crime syndicates of other ethnic and national origin, such as the Irish Mob, Japanese \"Yakuza\", Chinese \"Tongs\" and \"Triads\", \"Indian Mafia\", Colombian and Mexican \"drug cartels\", Chechen mafia, Russian mafia, Maltese mafia , the \"Thief in law\" and Eastern European families. Some of these entities, like the 'Ndrangheta, may also be organized along blood-family lines.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48403381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48403381", "title": "Dragon King Theory", "text": "Dragon King Theory\n\nDragon king (DK) is a double metaphor for an event that is both extremely large in size or impact (a \"king\") and born of unique origins (a \"dragon\") relative to its peers (other events from the same system). DK events are generated by / correspond to mechanisms such as positive feedback, tipping points, bifurcations, and phase transitions, that tend to occur in nonlinear and complex systems, and serve to amplify DK events to extreme levels. By understanding and monitoring these dynamics, some predictability of such events may be obtained.\n\nThe theory has been developed by Didier Sornette, who hypothesizes that many of the crises that we face are in fact DK rather than black swans—i.e., they may be predictable to some degree. Given the importance of crises to the long-term organization of a variety of systems, the DK theory urges that special attention be given to the study and monitoring of extremes, and that a dynamic view be taken. From a scientific viewpoint, such extremes are interesting because they may reveal underlying, often hidden, organizing principles. Practically speaking, one should ambitiously study extreme risks, but not forget that significant uncertainty will almost always be present, and should be rigorously considered in decisions regarding risk management and design.\n\nThe theory of DK is related to concepts such as black swan theory, outliers, complex systems, nonlinear dynamics, power laws, extreme value theory, prediction, extreme risks, and risk management.\n\nA black swan can be considered a metaphor for an event that is surprising (to the observer), has a major effect, and, after being observed, is rationalized in hindsight. The theory of black swans is epistemological, relating to the limited knowledge and understanding of the observer. The term was introduced and popularized by Nassim Taleb and has been associated with concepts such as heavy tails, non-linear payoffs, model error, and even Knightian uncertainty, whose “unknowable unknown” event terminology was popularized by former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Taleb claims that black swan events are not predictable, and in practice, the theory encourages one to “prepare rather than predict”, and limit one's exposure to extreme fluctuations.\n\nThe black swan concept is important and poses a valid criticism of people, firms, and societies that are irresponsible in the sense that they are overly confident in their ability to anticipate and manage risk. However, claiming that extreme events are – in general – unpredictable may also lead to a lack of accountability in risk management roles. In fact, it is known that in a wide range of physical systems that extreme events are predictable to some degree. One simply needs to have a sufficiently deep understanding of the structure and dynamics of the focal system, and the ability to monitor it. This is the domain of the dragon kings. Such events have been referred to as Grey Swans by Taleb. A more rigorous distinction between black swans, grey swans, and dragon kings is difficult as black swans are not precisely defined in physical and mathematical terms. However technical elaboration of concepts in the Black Swan book are elaborated in the Silent Risk document. An analysis of the precise definition of a black swan in a risk management context was written by Prof. Terje Aven.\n\nIt is well known that many phenomena in both the natural and social sciences have power law statistics (Pareto distribution) \n\n. Furthermore, from extreme value theory, it is known that a broad range of distributions (the Frechet class) have tails that are asymptotically power law. The result of this is that, when dealing with crises and extremes, power law tails are the “normal” case. The unique property of power laws is that they are scale-invariant / self-similar / fractal. This property implies that all events – both large and small – are generated by the same mechanism, and thus there will be no distinct precursors by which the largest events may be predicted. A well known conceptual framework for events of this type is self-organized criticality. Such concepts are compatible with the theory of the black swan. However Taleb has also stated that considering the power law as a model instead of a model with lighter tails (e.g., a Gaussian) “converts black swans into gray ones”, in the sense that the power law model gives non-negligible probability to large events.\n\nIn a variety of studies it has been found that, despite the fact that a power law models the tail of the empirical distribution well, the largest events are significantly outlying (i.e., much larger than what would be expected under the model)\n. Such events are interpreted as dragon kings as they indicate a departure from the generic process underlying the power law. Examples of this include the largest radiation release events occurring in nuclear power plant accidents, the largest city (agglomeration) within the sample of cities in a country, the largest crashes in financial markets, and intraday wholesale electricity prices.\n\nPhysically speaking, dragon kings may be associated with the regime changes, bifurcations, and tipping points of complex out-of-equilibrium systems. For instance, the catastrophe (fold bifurcation) of the global ecology illustrated in the figure could be considered to be a dragon king: Many observers would be surprised by such a dramatic change of state. However, it is well known that in dynamic systems, there are many precursors as the system approaches the catastrophe.\n\nPositive feedback is also a mechanism that can spawn dragon kings. For instance, in a stampede the number of cattle running increases the level of panic which causes more cattle to run, and so on. In human dynamics such herding and mob behavior has also been observed in crowds, stock markets, and so on (see herd behavior). \n\nDragon kings are also caused by attractor bubbling in coupled oscillator systems. Attractor bubbling is a generic behavior appearing in networks of coupled oscillators where the system typically orbits in an invariant manifold with a chaotic attractor (where the peak trajectories are low), but is intermittently pushed (by noise) into a region where orbits are locally repelled from the invariant manifold (where the peak trajectories are large). These excursions form the dragon kings, as illustrated in the figure. It is claimed that such models can describe many real phenomena such as earthquakes, brain activity, etc. A block and spring mechanical model, considered as a model of geological faults and their earthquake dynamics, produced a similar distribution.\n\nIt could also be the case that dragon kings are created as a result of system control or intervention. That is, trying to suppress the release of stress or death in dynamic complex systems may lead to an accumulation of stress or a maturation towards instability. For instance, brush/forest fires are a natural occurrence in many areas. Such fires are inconvenient and thus we may wish that they are diligently extinguished. This leads to long periods without inconvenient fires, however, in the absence of fires, dead wood accumulates. Once this accumulation reaches a critical point, and a fire starts, the fire becomes so large that it cannot be controlled – a singular event that could be considered to be a dragon king. Other policies, such as doing nothing (allowing for small fires to occur naturally), or performing strategic controlled burning, would avoid enormous fires by allowing for frequent small ones. Another example is monetary policy. Quantitative easing programs and low interest rate policies are common, with the intention of avoiding recessions, promoting growth, etc. However, such programs build instability by increasing income inequality, keeping weak firms alive, and inflating asset bubbles. Ultimately such policies, aimed at smoothing out economic fluctuations, will enable an enormous correction – a dragon king.\n\nDK are outliers by definition. However, when calling DK outliers there is an important proviso: In standard statistics outliers are typically erroneous values and are discarded, or statistical methods are chosen that are somehow insensitive to outliers. Contrarily, DK are outliers that are highly informative, and should be the focus of much statistical attention. Thus a first step is identifying DK in historical data. Existing tests are either based on the asymptotic properties of the empirical distribution function (EDF) or on an assumption about the underlying cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the data.\n\nIt turns out that testing for outliers relative to an exponential distribution is very general. The latter follows from the Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem of Extreme value theory which states that a wide range of distributions asymptotically (above high thresholds) have exponential or power law tails. As an aside, this is one explanation why power law tails are so common when studying extremes. To finish the point, since the natural logarithm of a power law tail is exponential, one can take the logarithm of power law data and then test for outliers relative to an exponential tail. There are many test statistics and techniques for testing for outliers in an exponential sample. An inward test sequentially tests the largest point, then the second largest, and so on, until the first test that is not rejected (i.e., the null hypothesis that the point is not an outlier is not rejected). The number of rejected tests identifies the number of outliers. For instance, where formula_1 is the sorted sample, the inward robust test uses the test statistic formula_2 where r is the point being tested formula_3, and formula_4 where m is the pre-specified maximum number of outliers. At each step the p-value for the test statistic must be computed and, if lower than some level, the test rejected. This test has many desirable properties: It does not require that the number of outliers be specified, it is not prone to under (masking) and over (swamping) estimation of the number outliers, it is easy to implement, and the test is independent of the value of the parameter of the exponential tail.\n\nSome examples of where dragon kings have been detected as outliers include:\n\n(I) financial crashes as measured by drawdowns, where the outliers correspond to terrorist attacks (e.g., the 2005 London bombing), and the Flash crash of 2010;\n\n(II) the radiation released and loss ($) caused by accidents at nuclear power plants, where outliers correspond to runaway disasters where safety mechanisms were overwhelmed;\n\n(III) the largest city (measured by the population in its agglomeration) in the population of cities within a country, where the largest city plays a disproportionately important role in the dynamics of the country, and benefits from unique growth; and,\n\n(IV) intraday wholesale electricity prices.\n\nHow one models and predicts dragon kings depends on the underlying mechanism. However, the common approach will require continuous monitoring of the focal system and comparing measurements with a (non-linear or complex) dynamic model. It has been proposed that the more homogeneous the system, and the stronger its interactions, the more predictable it will be.\nFor instance, in non-linear systems with phase transitions at a critical point, it is well known that a window of predictability occurs in the neighborhood of the critical point due to precursory signs: the system recovers more slowly from perturbations, autocorrelation changes, variance increases, spatial coherence increases, etc. These properties have been used for prediction in many applications ranging from changes in the bio-sphere to rupture of pressure tanks on the Ariane rocket.\nFor the phenomena of unsustainable growth (e.g., of populations or stock prices), one can consider a growth model that features a finite time singularity, which is a critical point where the growth regime changes. In systems that are discrete scale invariant such a model is power law growth, decorated with a log-periodic function. Fitting this model on the growth data (non-linear regression) allows for the prediction of the singularity, i.e., the end of unsustainable growth. This has been applied to many problems, for instance: rupture in materials, earthquakes, and the growth and burst of bubbles in financial markets\n(see http://www.er.ethz.ch/financial-crisis-observatory.html for bubble indicators based on such techniques).\n\nAn interesting dynamic to consider, that may reveal the development of a block-buster success, is Epidemic phenomena: e.g., the spread of plague, viral phenomena in media, the spread of panic and volatility in stock markets, etc. In such a case, a powerful approach is to decompose activity/fluctuations into exogeneous and endogeneous parts, and learn about the endogenous dynamics that may lead to high impact bursts in activity. \n\nGiven a model and data, one can obtain a statistical model estimate. This model estimate can then be used to compute interesting quantities such as the conditional probability of the occurrence of a dragon king event in a future time interval, and the most probable occurrence time. When doing statistical modeling of extremes, and using complex or nonlinear dynamic models, there is bound to be substantial uncertainty. Thus, one should be diligent in uncertainty quantification: not only considering the randomness present in the fitted stochastic model, but also the uncertainty of its estimated parameters (e.g., with Bayesian techniques or by first simulating parameters and then simulating from the model with those parameters), and the uncertainty in model selection (e.g., by considering an ensemble of different models).\n\nOne can then use the estimated probabilities and their associated uncertainties to inform decisions. In the simplest case, one performs a binary classification: predicting that a dragon king will occur in a future interval if its probability of occurrence is high enough, with sufficient certainty. For instance, one may take a specific action if a dragon king is predicted to occur. An optimal decision will then balance the cost of false negatives/false positives and misses/false alarms according to a specified loss function. For instance, if the cost of a miss is very large relative to the cost of a false alarm, the optimal decision will detect dragon kings more frequently than they occur. One should also study the true positive rate of the prediction. The smaller this value is, the weaker the test, and the closer one is to black swan territory. In practice the selection of the optimal decision, and the computation of its properties must be done by cross validation with historical data (if available), or on simulated data (if one knows how to simulate the dragon kings).\n\nIn a dynamic setting the dataset will grow over time, and the model estimate, and its estimated probabilities will evolve. One may then consider combining the sequence of estimates/probabilities when performing prediction. In this dynamic setting, the test will likely be weak most of the time (e.g., when the system is around equilibrium), but as one approaches a dragon king, and precursors become visible, the true positive rate should increase.\n\nDragon kings form special kinds of events leading to extreme risks (which can also be opportunities). That extreme risks are important should be self-evident. Natural disasters provide many examples (e.g., asteroid impacts leading to extinction). Some statistical examples of the impact of extremes are that: the largest nuclear power plant accident (2011 Fukushima disaster) caused more damage than all (>200) other historical accidents together, the largest 10 percent of private data breaches from organizations accounts for 99 percent of the total breached private information, the largest 5 epidemics since 1900 caused 20 times the fatalities of the remaining 1363, etc. In general such statistics arrive in the presence of heavy tailed distributions, and the presence of dragon kings will augment the already oversized impact of extreme events.\n\nDespite the importance of extreme events, due to ignorance, misaligned incentives, and cognitive biases, we often fail to adequately anticipate them. Technically speaking, this leads to poorly specified models where distributions that are not heavy tailed enough, and under-appreciating both serial and multivariate dependence of extreme events. Some examples of such failures in risk assessment include the use of Gaussian models in finance (Black-Scholes, the Gaussian copula, LTCM), the use of Gaussian processes and linear wave theory failing to predict the occurrence of rogue waves, the failure of economic models in general to predict the 2007 financial crisis, and the under-appreciation of external events, cascades, and nonlinear effects in probabilistic risk assessment, leading to not anticipating the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Such high impact failures emphasize the importance of the study of extremes.\n\nThe dragon king concept raises many questions about how one can deal with risk. Of course, if possible, one should avoid exposure to large risks (often referred to as the black swan approach). However, in many developments, exposure to risk is a necessity, and a trade-off between risk and return needs to be navigated. This nontrivial case is the one that must be considered.\n\nIn an adaptive system, where prediction of dragon kings is successful, one can act to defend the system or even profit. How to design such resilient systems, as well as their real time risk monitoring systems\n, is an important and interdisciplinary problem where dragon kings must be considered.\n\nOn another note, when it comes to the quantification of risk in a given system (whether it be a bank, an insurance company, a dike, a bridge, or a socio-economic system), risk needs to be accounted for over a period, such as annually. Typically one is interested in statistics such as the annual probability of loss or damage in excess of some value (Value at risk), other tail risk measures, and return periods. To provide such risk characterizations, the dynamic dragon kings must be reasoned about in terms of annual frequency and severity statistics. These frequency and severity statistics can then be brought together in a model such as a Compound Poisson Process.\n\nProvided that the statistical properties of the system are consistent over time (stationary), frequency and severity statistics may be constructed based on past observations, simulations, and/or assumptions. If not, one may only construct scenarios. However, in any case, given the uncertainty present, a range of scenarios should be considered. Due to the shortage of data for extreme events, the principle of parsimony, and theoretical results from extreme value theory about universal tail models, one typically relies on a GPD tail model. However such a model excludes DK. Thus, when one has sufficient reason to believe that DK are present, or if one simply wants to consider a scenario, one may e.g., consider a density mixture of a GPD and a density for the DK regime.\n"}

His father, Ansaruddin Mollah, was a school-teacher. Mother Amina Khatun (Rangachhut) received early education at Faridpur Welfare School. He matriculated from Faridpur Zilla School in 1921. Jasimuddin completed IA from Rajendra College in 1924. He obtained his BA degree in Bengali from the University of Calcutta in 1929 and his MA in 1931. From 1931 to 1937, he worked with Dinesh Chandra Sen as a collector of folk literature. Jasimuddin is one of the compilers of \"Purbo-Bongo Gitika\" (Ballads of East Bengal). He collected more than 10,000 folk songs, some of which has been included in his song compilations \"Jari Gaan\" and \"Murshida Gaan\". He also wrote voluminously on the interpretation and philosophy of Bengali folklore.\n\nJasimuddin joined the University of Dhaka in 1938 as a lecturer. He left the university in 1944 and the worked at the Department of Information and Broadcasting until his retirement in 1962 as the deputy director.\n\nJasimuddin started writing poems at an early age. As a college student, he wrote the celebrated poem \"Kabar\" (\"The Grave\"), a simple tone to obtain family-religion and tragedy. The poem was placed in the entrance Bengali textbook while he was still a student of Calcutta University.\n\nJasimuddin is noted for his depiction of rural life and nature from the viewpoint of rural people. This had earned the title as Palli Kabi (the rural poet). The structure and content of his poetry bears a strong flavor of Bengal folklore. His \"Nokshi Kanthar Maath\" (Field of the Embroidered Quilt) is considered a masterpiece and has been translated into many different languages.\n\nJasimuddin was introduced with Abbas Uddin by poet Golam Mostofa in a musical program held in Kolkata in 1931.\n\n\nJasimuddin was married to Begum Mamtaz Jasimuddin (d. 2006). Together they had three sons, Jamal Anwar, Firoz Anwar and Khurshid Anwar, and two daughters, Begum Hasna Moudud and Asma Elahi. Hasna is the wife of politician Moudud Ahmed.\n\nJasimuddin died on 13 March 1976 and was buried near his ancestral home at Gobindapur, Faridpur. A fortnightly festival known as \"Jasim Mela\" is observed at Gobindapur each year in January commemorating his birthday.\n\n\n\"Boba Kahini\" (1964)\n\n\n"}

Correa left school at young age.\n\nHe started to publish his poems in 1926.\n\nEncouraged by the poet Manuel Ortiz Guerrero, he started to write an article titled “Dialoguitos Callejeros” (Small Street Dialogues) in the newspaper Guarani, of Facundo Recalde.\n\nHis talent became apparent during the Chaco War. His work in the Guarani language was very well received by the public and became known as an author, actor and director.\n\nFrom 1934 to 1936, he published his poems in the magazine Guarania, of Natalicio González. Those became part, later on, of the book Body and Soul. (1943). In 1947, he was arrested because of his writings. The civil war that year had a negative effect on the author, and he became depressed. He remained isolated in his country house in Luque, where he died on July 14, 1953.\n\nHe came from a well-to-do family that had fallen on hard times as a result of adversities in the aftermath of the war of 1870. His work is, without doubt, the utmost expression of creation of Paraguayan dramatic art and the Guarani theatre, always inspired in social subjects. Descendant of Brazilian people, his father fought in the war and once it ended, decided to stay in Paraguay, like many other soldiers at the time. As a child he grew among people that talk Guaraní, among countryman and peons, and it was from that time, he started to acknowledge their struggles to survive. When he became a grown man, he discovered himself as able to read this people, as an interpreter to them, in the theater as in the social action.\n\nHe was very good friends with the sculptor Erminio Blotta (from Rosario, Argentina), honorary citizen of Paraguay.\n\nMarried with the notorious actress, Georgina Martínez. They founded together a theatre company, with which he traveled to every part of Paraguay, carrying a message condemning the injustice of large entailed lands and the exploit of the working country man.\n\nWalter Wey, a Brazilian researcher, makes a colorful portrait of the multifaceted Correa: “Who does not know and admire Julio Correa? Poet, dramatist, businessman, storyteller and distiller of politic and literary poisons. Maybe the victims, men and women of his satirical stories, felt disrespected but all of them know those stories by memory. Hearing Correa recite them in Palma Street or in his country house in Luque constituted one of the most beautiful shows to witness. It was because of this, that he was persecuted and sometimes put in jail, to satisfaction of his detractors. But the applause and admiration of the people kept him going.\n\nHe was the creator of the Guarani theatre, its greater author and also its best actor. With great intuition he felt the Paraguayan problematic was the unjust distribution of land, because it was just like Justo Pastor Benítez wrote: “the Paraguayan people are just a mere occupant of his own land”. Correa had this saying for truth and became a fighter for the cause, standing against foreign and national large entailed land with enormous courage. In his house in Luque a single book cannot be seen, only farm animals, there is nothing that reminiscence the house of a poet.\n\nJulio Correa is a poet without culture and, what’s more interesting, without the desire or preoccupation to acquire it. The poems in Spanish language he gathered in his book “Alma y Cuerpo” (Body and Soul) closed a period in time and marked the beginning of a new road, that would be widened by Hérib Campos Cervera, with the introduction of the “literature of vanguard” \nIt is Campos Cervera, that completes the description of Correa, saying: “He is the great creator of images of our society and problematic, the drama of misery, land, blood and jealousy”.\n\nThe Paraguayan people have Correa as a mirror of its hope, pain, and joy. He did not settle for just creating a story character, he also manifested their joy and sadness, and their moral ups and downs. In stage, he showed the audience the different shades of passion, all the rage of hatred and the goodness of compassion, his voice transmitted the sentiment of his art.\n\nHis production includes:\nJulio Correa also wrote Yvy yara, Toribio, Yuaijhugui reí, Po’a rusuva and La culpa de bueno.\n\nAmong his stories are Nicolasia del Espiritu Santo (1943), El Padre Cantalicio, El borracho de la casa and El hombre que robó una pava (unconcluded), all of these were published after his death.\n\nHe died on July 14, 1953 in Luque, Paraguay, city close to the Paraguayan capital. His house is nowadays the “Museum Julio Correa”.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3628775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3628775", "title": "Ku (fictional language)", "text": "Ku (fictional language)\n\nKu is a fictional language appearing in the 2005 drama/thriller film \"The Interpreter\". In the film, Ku is a language spoken in the fictional African country of Matobo. The constructed language was created for the film by Said el-Gheithy, the director of the Centre for African Language Learning in Covent Garden, London. Commissioned by \"The Interpreter's\" director, Sydney Pollack, and Working Title Films, el-Gheithy adapted aspects of Shona and Swahili, languages spoken in Eastern and Southern Africa, to devise the basis of this fictional language. The language has its own internal dictionary and el-Gheithy created a whole culture and history in his mind.\n\nIn this context, the actual language spoken by the \"Tobosa\" people of the fictional Democratic Republic of Matobo, although known as 'Ku' to foreigners, is indigenously known as \"Chitob uk u\" which literally means 'the language of the Tobosa people'. \"Ch'itoboku\", then, would be the only surviving ancient Bantu language, and the Tobosa oral traditions indicate that 'Ku' is the root of modern Bantu languages spoken in contemporary Sub-Saharan Africa. There is no gender distinction, hence the word for 'he' or 'she' is the same, 'a'. Verbosity is positively valued in \"Ch'itoboku\", and ordinary speech should approximate the elegance of poetry.\n\nAs with most African cultures, \"Tobosa\" customs are based on age and gender. Drawing on the historical tradition, elders greet younger generations first, and women speak before men. Greetings are essentially verbal, but are followed by a touching of foreheads. The most common expression in greeting is 'sonna', meaning 'hello', but a more energised greeting is \"kwambu\", and the response is \"kwamb uk uu\", 'and how are you?'\n\nThere is not a single word for 'thanks,' but the word \"tenane\" is used to show appreciation and is expressed through the clapping of hands. Men clap with their palms and fingers together, while women clap with their hands across each other. During meetings and conversation, sneezing is an indication of disbelief. On leaving, one would say \"digai\", which actually means 'you haven't gone for ever, we will see you again'. The person staying responds by saying \"\".\n\nThe language and cultures of the Tobosa have been influenced by links with the outside world through colonialism and more recently as a result of processes of globalisation. For example, modern technology has become part of the modern 'Ku' vocabulary, and is now written and pronounced as \"Kompyutanga\". Matobo is currently enjoying more prosperity, not from the usual gas and mineral resources, but rather from its special herbal tea, \"zingwe\", drinking of which is believed to guarantee eternal youth.\n\n\"We're \"kepéla\". – It means standing on opposite sides of the river.\" (Nicole Kidman as Silvia Broome in \"The Interpreter\")\n\n"}

{"id": "369682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369682", "title": "Lost in Translation (film)", "text": "Lost in Translation (film)\n\nLost in Translation is a 2003 romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Sofia Coppola. It stars Bill Murray as aging actor Bob Harris, who befriends college graduate Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) in a Tokyo hotel.\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Bill Murray, and Best Director for Coppola; Coppola won for Best Original Screenplay. Murray and Johansson each won a BAFTA award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Leading Role respectively. The film grossed $119 million on a budget of $4 million.\n\nBob Harris, an aging American movie star, arrives in Tokyo to film an advertisement for Suntory whisky. Charlotte, a young college graduate, is left in her hotel room by her husband, John, a celebrity photographer on assignment in Tokyo. Charlotte is unsure of her future with John, feeling detached from his lifestyle and disillusioned about their relationship. Bob's own 25-year marriage is strained as he goes through a midlife crisis.\n\nEach day, Bob and Charlotte encounter each other in the hotel, and finally meet at the hotel bar one night when neither can sleep. Eventually, Charlotte invites Bob to meet with some local friends of hers. The two bond through a fun night in Tokyo, welcomed without prejudice by Charlotte's friends and experiencing Japanese nightlife and culture. In the days that follow, Bob and Charlotte's platonic relationship develops as they spend more time together. One night, each unable to sleep, the two share an intimate conversation about Charlotte's personal troubles and Bob's married life.\n\nOn the penultimate night of his stay, Bob sleeps with the hotel bar's female jazz singer. The next morning Charlotte arrives at his room to invite him for lunch and overhears the woman in his room, leading to an argument over lunch. Later that night, during a fire alarm at the hotel, Bob and Charlotte reconcile and express how they will miss each other as they make a final visit to the hotel bar.\n\nThe following morning, Bob is set to return to the United States. He tells Charlotte goodbye at the hotel lobby and sadly watches her walk back to the elevator. In a taxi to the airport, Bob sees Charlotte on a crowded street and gets out and goes to her. He embraces the tearful Charlotte and whispers something in her ear. The two share a kiss, say goodbye and Bob departs.\n\nOver the course of the film, several things are \"lost in translation\". Bob (Murray), a Japanese director (Yutaka Tadokoro), and an interpreter (Takeshita) are on a set, filming a commercial for Suntory whisky (specifically, 17-year-old Hibiki). In several exchanges, the director gives lengthy, impassioned directives in Japanese. These are invariably followed by brief, incomplete translations from the interpreter.\n\nIn addition to the meaning and detail lost in the translation of the director's words, the two central characters in the film—Bob and Charlotte—are also lost in other ways. On a basic level, they are lost in the alien Japanese culture. But in addition, they are lost in their own lives and relationships, a feeling, amplified by their displaced location, that leads to their blossoming friendship and growing connection with one another.\n\nBy her own admission, Coppola wanted to create a romantic movie about two characters that have a moment of connection. The story's timeline was intentionally shortened to emphasize this moment. Additionally, Coppola has said that since \"there's not much happening in the story besides [Bob and Charlotte's relationship]\", the filmmakers tried to keep an ongoing tension.\nMurray has described his biggest challenge in portraying Bob as managing the character's conflicted feelings. On one hand, Murray said, Bob knows that it could be dangerous to become too close to Charlotte, but on the other, he is lonely and knows that having an affair would be easy. Murray worked to portray a balance between being affectionate and being \"respectable\".\n\nThe academic Marco Abel lists \"Lost in Translation\" as one of many films that belong to the category of \"postromance\" cinema, which he says offers a negative perspective of love, sex, romance, and dating. According to Abel, the characters in such films reject the idealized notion of lifelong monogamy.\n\nThe author and filmmaker Anita Schillhorn van Veen interprets the film as a criticism of modernity, in which Tokyo is a contemporary \"floating world\" of fleeting pleasures that are too alienating and amoral to facilitate meaningful relationships. Tessa Dwyer, writing for \"Linguistica Antverpiensia, New Series – Themes in Translation Studies\", called \"Lost in Translation\" a polyglot film that challenges the film industry's \"more usual tendency to ignore or deny issues of language difference\" by highlighting Bob and Charlotte's difficult contact with the Japanese language.\n\nThe author and lecturer Maria San Filippo contends that the film's setting, Tokyo, is an audiovisual metaphor for Bob and Charlotte's world views. She explains that the calm ambience of the city's hotel represents Bob's desire to be secure and undisturbed, while the energetic atmosphere of the city streets represents Charlotte's willingness to engage with the world. Coppola and Acord, the film's cinematographer, agreed that \"Lost in Translation\" needed to rely heavily on visual expression to support the characters' romance.\n\nRobert Hahn, an essayist writing for \"The Southern Review\", suggested that the filmmakers deliberately used chiaroscuro, the art of using strong contrasts between light and dark to support the story. He wrote that the film's dominant light tones symbolize feelings of humor and romance, and they are contrasted with dark tones that symbolize underlying feelings of despondency. He compared this to the technique of the painter John Singer Sargent.\n\nThe film's opening shot, which features a close shot of Charlotte sitting in translucent pink underwear, has interested various commentators. In particular, it has been compared to the portraitures of the painter John Kacere and the image of Brigitte Bardot in the opening scene of the 1963 film \"Contempt\". Dwyer wrote that when the two shots are compared, they reveal the importance of language difference, as both films highlight the complexities involved with characters speaking multiple languages. Filippo wrote that while the image in \"Contempt\" is used to remark on sexual objectification, Coppola \"doesn't seem to be making a statement at all beyond a sort of endorsement of beauty for beauty's sake\".\n\nCoppola revealed in a 2013 interview that the shot is indeed based on the art of Kacere. Geoff King, a professor of film at Brunel University (who published a book on the film, under the same name in a series titled \"American indies\", in 2010), contends that the shot is marked by an \"obvious\" appeal in its potential eroticism, and a \"subtle\" appeal in its artistic qualities. He used the shot as an example of the film's obvious attractions, which are characteristic of mainstream film, and its subtle ones, which are typified by \"indie\" film.\n\nCoppola devised the idea of \"Lost in Translation\" after many visits to Tokyo in her twenties, basing much of the story on her experiences there. Coppola was attracted to the neon lights of Tokyo and has described the Park Hyatt Tokyo, where most of the film's interior sequences take place, as one of her \"favorite places in the world\". Particularly, she was attracted to its quietness, design, and \"combination of different cultures\", which include a New York bar and French restaurant.\n\nCoppola spent six months writing the film, beginning with \"short stories\" and \"impressions\" that culminated in a 70-page script. She wanted to create a story that was \"a little more funny and romantic\" than her previous feature, \"The Virgin Suicides\", and she spent little time planning or rewriting it. Coppola has called the film a \"valentine\" to Tokyo, in which she has displayed the city in the way that it is meaningful to her.\n\nCoppola wrote the film with Murray in mind and said she would not have made it without him. She said that she had always wanted to work with Murray and that she was attracted to his \"sweet, lovable side\". She pursued him for five months to a year, relentlessly sending telephone messages and letters. She enlisted help from Wes Anderson, who had directed Murray in two films, and screenwriter Mitch Glazer, who was a mutual friend. Coppola went as far to asking for help from actor Al Pacino, who at the time lived in the same town as Murray. In July 2002, Coppola and Murray finally met in a restaurant, and he agreed to participate because he \"couldn't let her down\". Despite this, Murray did not sign a contract; when he finally arrived in Tokyo, Coppola described it as \"a huge relief\".\n\nCoppola first noticed Scarlett Johansson in \"Manny & Lo\", where she related to her \"understated\" and \"subtle\" demeanor, envisioning her as a \"young Lauren Bacall-type girl\". Johansson, who was 17 years old at the time, immediately accepted the part and Coppola was happy with the maturity she brought to the character. In writing the story, Coppola said she was influenced by the relationship between Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in Howard Hawks' \"The Big Sleep\". Murray and Johansson did not do any auditions before filming.\n\nLance Acord, the film's director of photography, has written that the cinematographic style of \"Lost in Translation\" is largely based on \"daily experiences, memories and impressions\" of his time in Japan. He worked closely with Coppola to visualize the film, relying on multiple experiences he shared with her in Tokyo before production took place. Location scouting was carried out by Coppola, Acord, and Ross Katz; and Coppola created 40 pages of photographs for the crew so that they would understand her visual intentions.\n\nAcord sought to maximize available light during shooting and use artificial lights as little as possible. He described this approach as conservative compared to \"the more conventional Hollywood system\", for which some of the crew's Japanese electricians thought he was \"out of his mind\". In particular, Acord did not use any artificial lights to photograph the film's night-time exteriors. \"Lost in Translation\" was largely shot in an improvised, \"free-form\" manner, which Coppola described as \"stealthy\" and \"almost documentary-style\". The crew shot in some locations without permits, including Tokyo's subways and Shibuya Crossing; they avoided police by keeping a minimal crew. Acord avoided grandiose camera movements in favor of still shots to avoid taking away from the loneliness of the characters.\n\nMost of the film was shot on an Aaton camera with 35 mm film stock, using Kodak Vision 500T 5263 stock for nightlight exteriors and Kodak Vision 320T 5277 stock in daylight. A smaller Moviecam Compact was used in confined locations. Coppola said that her father, Francis Ford Coppola, tried to convince her to shoot on video, but she ultimately decided on film, describing its \"fragmented, dislocated, melancholic, romantic feeling\", in contrast with video, which is \"more immediate, in the present\". In interviews, she said she wanted to shoot Tokyo with a spontaneous \"informality\", similar to the \"way a snapshot looks\", and she chose to shoot on high-speed film stocks to evoke a \"homemade intimacy\". Some scenes were shot wholly for mood and were captured without sound.\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" was shot six days per week in September and October 2002, over the course of 27 days. During this time, videotape footage was mailed to editor Sarah Flack in New York City, where she began editing the film in a Red Car office. The scenes with Bob and Charlotte together were largely shot in order. Many of the interior scenes were shot overnight, because the hotel did not allow the crew to shoot in much of its public space until after 1 a.m.\n\nVarious locations were used during production; in particular, the bar featured prominently in the film is the New York Bar, which is situated on the 52nd floor of the Shinjuku Park Tower and part of the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Other locations include the Heian Jingu shrine in Kyoto and the steps of the San-mon gate at Nanzen-ji, as well as the club Air in the Daikanyama district of Tokyo. All of the locations mentioned in the film are the names of actual places that existed in Tokyo at the time of filming. Murray described the first few weeks of the shoot as like \"being held prisoner\", since he was affected by jet lag, and Johansson said the shoot made her \"busy, vulnerable and tired\".\n\nCoppola spoke of the challenges of directing the movie with a Japanese crew, since she had to rely on her assistant director to make translations. Much of the performances were improvised, and Coppola openly allowed modifications to dialogue during shooting. For example, the dialogue in the scene with Harris and the still photographer was unrehearsed. Coppola has said that she was attracted to the idea of Bob and Charlotte going through stages of a romantic relationship all in one week—in which they have met, courted, hurt each other, and discussed intimate life. To conclude this relationship, Coppola wanted a special ending even though she thought the concluding scene in the script was mundane. Coppola instructed Murray to perform the kiss in that scene without telling Johansson, to which she reacted without preparation. The whisper was also unscripted, but too quiet to be recorded. While Coppola initially considered having audible dialogue dubbed into the moment, she later decided that it was better to keep it \"between the two of \nthem.\"\n\nAfter filming, Coppola and Flack spent approximately 10 weeks editing the film. In the bonus features of the film's DVD, Murray called \"Lost in Translation\" his favorite film that he has worked on, and Coppola described the film as her most \"personal\", since much of the story is based on her own experiences. For example, Charlotte's relationship with her husband is based on Coppola's relationship with her husband, Spike Jonze, when they first married, and the \"Suntory\" commercial is based on a commercial Coppola's father, Francis Ford Coppola, shot with Akira Kurosawa.\n\nThe film's soundtrack, supervised by Brian Reitzell, was released on September 9, 2003 by Emperor Norton Records. It contains five songs by Kevin Shields, including one from his group My Bloody Valentine. Coppola said much of the soundtrack consisted of songs that she \"liked and had been listening to\", and she worked with Reitzell to make Tokyo dream pop mixes. The soundtrack also included The Jesus and Mary Chain hit \"Just Like Honey\". Allmusic gave the soundtrack four out of five stars, saying \"Coppola's impressionistic romance \"Lost in Translation\" features an equally impressionistic and romantic soundtrack that plays almost as big a role in the film as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson do.\"\n\nAgathi Glezakos, an academic writing a review of \"Lost in Translation\" shortly after its release, wrote that the music in the film's karaoke scene constitutes a common \"language\" that allows Bob and Charlotte to connect with some of the Japanese people amidst their alienation. In that scene, the rendition of the Pretenders' \"Brass in Pocket\" was selected to showcase a lively side of Charlotte, and \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\" was chosen to establish that Bob is from a different generation. Both Coppola and Murray finally selected Roxy Music's \"More Than This\" during the shoot itself because they liked the band and thought the lyrics fit the story.\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" was screened at the 2003 Telluride Film Festival. It was given a limited release on September 12, 2003 in 23 theaters where it grossed $925,087 on its opening weekend with an average of $40,221 per theater and ranking 15th at the box office. It was given a wider release on October 3, 2003 in 864 theaters where it grossed $4,163,333 with an average of $4,818 per theater and ranking 7th. The film went on to make $44,585,453 in North America and $75,138,403 in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $119,723,856.\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" received critical acclaim, particularly for Coppola's direction and screenplay and Murray and Johansson's performances. It has a score of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.4/10 based on 227 reviews. The site's critical consensus states: \"Effectively balancing humor and subtle pathos, Sofia Coppola crafts a moving, melancholy story that serves as a showcase for both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson\". The film also holds a score of 89 out of 100 based on 43 reviews on Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nCritic Roger Ebert gave \"Lost in Translation\" four out of four stars and named it the second best film of the year, describing it as \"sweet and sad at the same time as it is sardonic and funny\". In his review for \"The New York Times\", Elvis Mitchell wrote: \"At 18, [Johansson] gets away with playing a 25-year-old woman by using her husky voice to test the level of acidity in the air ... Ms. Johansson is not nearly as accomplished a performer as Mr. Murray, but Ms. Coppola gets around this by using Charlotte's simplicity and curiosity as keys to her character.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film an \"A\" rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote: \"Working opposite the embracing, restful serenity of Johansson, Murray reveals something more commanding in his repose than we have ever seen before. Trimmed to a newly muscular, rangy handsomeness and in complete rapport with his character's hard-earned acceptance of life's limitations, Murray turns in a great performance.\"\n\nIn his review for \"The New York Observer\", Andrew Sarris called the film \"that rarity of rarities, a grown-up romance based on the deliberate repression of sexual gratification ... when independent films are exploding with erotic images edging ever closer to outright pornography, Ms. Coppola and her colleagues have replaced sexual facility with emotional longing, without being too coy or self-congratulatory in the process.\" \"USA Today\" gave the film three and a half stars out of four and wrote that it \"offers quiet humor in lieu of the bludgeoning direct assaults most comedies these days inflict\". \"Time\"s Richard Corliss praised Murray's performance: \"You won't find a subtler, funnier or more poignant performance this year than this quietly astonishing turn.\" His performance has been likened to the sardonic persona of W. C. Fields.\n\nIn his review for \"The Observer\", Philip French wrote: \"While \"Lost in Translation\" is deeply sad and has a strongly Antonioniesque flavour, it's also a wispy romantic comedy with little plot and some well-observed comic moments.\" In \"The Guardian\", Joe Queenan praised Coppola's film as \"one of the few Hollywood films I have seen this year that has a brain; but more than that, it has a soul.\" \"Rolling Stone\"s Peter Travers gave it four out of four stars and wrote: \"Before saying goodbye, they whisper something to each other that the audience can't hear. Coppola keeps her film as hushed and intimate as that whisper. \"Lost in Translation\" is found gold. Funny how a wisp of a movie from a wisp of a girl can wipe you out.\" J. Hoberman, in his review for the \"Village Voice\", wrote: \"\"Lost in Translation\" is as bittersweet a brief encounter as any in American movies since Richard Linklater's equally romantic \"Before Sunrise\". But \"Lost in Translation\" is the more poignant reverie. Coppola evokes the emotional intensity of a one-night stand far from home—but what she really gets is the magic of movies\".\n\nThe Los Angeles Film Critics Association and National Society of Film Critics voted Bill Murray best actor of the year. The New York Film Critics Circle also voted Murray best actor and Sofia Coppola best director. Coppola received an award for special filmmaking achievement from the National Board of Review. \"Lost in Translation\" also appeared on several critics' top ten lists for 2003. Roger Ebert added it to his \"great movies\" list on his website. \"Paste Magazine\" named it one of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000-2009), ranking it at #7. \"Entertainment Weekly\" named it one of the best films of the decade, writing: \"Six years later, we still have no clue what Bill Murray whispered into Scarlett Johansson's ear. And we don't want to. Why spoil a perfect film?\" Director Quentin Tarantino included \"Lost in Translation\" in his list of top 20 films released since 1992, when his career as a filmmaker began.\n\nIn a 2016 international critics' poll by the BBC, \"Lost in Translation\" was voted the 22nd greatest film since 2000.\n\nThe film received some negative reviews, many from Japanese critics. Japanese TV critic Osugi of Osugi and Piko fame said \"The core story is cute and not bad; however, the depiction of Japanese people is terrible!\" In a \"Guardian\" article about the film, Kiku Day, a musician specializing in the \"shakuhachi\" Japanese flute, wrote that she \"couldn't help wondering not only whether I had watched a different movie, but whether the plaudits had come from a parallel universe of values\"; according to Day, there is \"no scene where the Japanese are afforded a shred of dignity. The viewer is sledgehammered into laughing at these small, yellow people and their funny ways.\" Day also said \"while shoe-horning every possible caricature of modern Japan into her movie, Coppola is respectful of ancient Japan. It is depicted approvingly, though ancient traditions have very little to do with the contemporary Japanese. The good Japan, according to this director, is Buddhist monks chanting, ancient temples, flower arrangement; meanwhile she portrays the contemporary Japanese as ridiculous people who have lost contact with their own culture.\"\n\nHawaiian filmmaker and author E. Koohan Paik wrote that \"The Japanese are presented not as people, but as clowns\" and that \"\"Lost in Translation\" relies wholly on the \"otherness\" of the Japanese to give meaning to its protagonists, shape to its plot, and color to its scenery. The inaccessibility of Japan functions as an extension of the alienation and loneliness Bob and Charlotte feel in their personal lives, thus laying the perfect conditions for romance to germinate: they're the only ones who understand each other. Take away the cartooniness of the Japanese and the humor falls flat, the main characters' intense yearning is neutralized and the plot evaporates.\"\n\nIn another \"Guardian\" article, journalist David Stubbs described \"Lost in Translation\" as \"mopey, self-pitying drivel\", and its characters as \"spoiled, bored, rich, utterly unsympathetic Americans\". In an article published in a 2004 issue of \"Maclean's\", Steve Burgess criticized the film as an ethnocentric \"compendium of unpleasant stereotypes ... indicative of the way visitors and foreign workers often view Japan.\" Robin Antepara, an educator writing for an issue of \"Commonweal\", wrote that while the story embodies stereotypes, \"Charlotte is the personification of Japanese watchfulness,\" an often neglected virtue. The academic Maria San Filippo wrote that the \"retreat into America-centrism would be disappointing if, again, it were not so truthful ... Coppola knows firsthand that American tourists rarely get to know any Japanese well enough to discover their depth as sympathetic human beings.\" Katz responded to some of the criticism by saying \"Sofia's love of Japan and love of the people that she's met there is incredibly evident in the film... Literally, we recounted experiences that I think all of us had gone through,\" and that none of the scenes were \"any slight to Japanese people.\"\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 2003. It was also nominated for Best Director and Best Picture, but lost both to \"\". Bill Murray was also nominated for Best Actor, but lost to Sean Penn for \"Mystic River\".\n\nThe film won Golden Globes for Best Musical or Comedy Motion Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Musical or Comedy Actor. It was also nominated for Best Director, and Best Musical or Comedy Actress.\n\nAt the BAFTA film awards, \"Lost in Translation\" won the Best Editing, Best Actor and Best Actress awards. It was also nominated for best film, director, original screenplay, music and cinematography. It won four IFP Independent Spirit Awards, for Best Feature, Director, Male Lead, and Screenplay. The film was honored with the original screenplay award from the Writers Guild of America.\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" was released on DVD on February 3, 2004. \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave it an \"A\" rating and criticized \"the disc's slim bonus features\", but praised the film for standing \"on its own as a valentine to the mysteries of attraction\".\n\n\"Lost in Translation\" was also released in high definition on the now defunct HD DVD format. A Blu-ray edition was released on January 4, 2011.\n\n\n"}

She is known for her theories on sexism, racism, oppression, and sexuality. Her writings offer discussions of feminist topics, such as: white supremacy, male privilege, and gay and lesbian marginalization. Although she approaches the issues from the perspective of justice, she is also deeply engaged with the metaphysics, epistemology, and moral psychology of social categories.\n\nFrye received the BA with honors in philosophy from Stanford University in 1963 and received the PhD in Philosophy at Cornell University in 1969, writing a dissertation titled \"Meaning and Illocutionary Force,\" under the supervision of Max Black. Before coming to Michigan State University in 1974, she taught in the Philosophy Department at the University of Pittsburgh. From 2003 until her retirement, Frye was University Distinguished Professor at Michigan State University; she also served as Associate Dean for Graduate Studies of the College of Arts and Letters. In 2008 she was the Phi Beta Kappa Romanell Lecturer.\n\nFrye is the author of \"The Politics of Reality\" (1983), a collection of nine essays which has become a \"classic\" of feminist philosophy.\nIn her chapter entitled \"Oppression\" in the book \"Feminist Frontiers\", Frye discusses the idea of the double bind in gender. This double bind refers to \"situations in which options are reduced to a very few and all of them expose one to penalty, censure or deprivation\". Frye applies this principle to gender and the dilemma women often face in her discussion of oppression. For example, it is neither socially acceptable for a women to be sexually active or for her to be sexually inactive and labelled a \"man-hater\" or \"uptight\". This absence of choice permeates so thoroughly into women's day-to-day life that even small things like how they choose to dress or talk are criticized. Frye acknowledges that men face issues as well, but differentiates the issues of men and women through the metaphor of a bird cage. Each individual bind women face can be thought of as a single bar in a cage: by itself, it isn't enough to contain the bird. But, with enough bars, the bird is trapped inside the cage, left with nowhere to go. This is the complete absence of choice Frye describes: how it is the culmination of issues women face that is so \"immobilizing\" and why their struggle, and not men's, is considered oppression.\n\nFrye is openly lesbian, and much of her work explores social categories—in particular, those based on race and gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For phonological characteristics of other varieties, see varieties of Modern Greek, and for Cypriot, specifically, see .\n\nGreek linguists do not agree on which consonants to count as phonemes in their own right, and which to count as conditional allophones. The table below is adapted from , who does away with the entire palatal series, and both affricates and .\n\nThe alveolar nasal is assimilated to following obstruents; it can be labiodental (e.g. 'doubt'), dental (e.g. 'flower'), retracted alveolar (e.g. \"pliers\"), alveolo-palatal (e.g. 'to annoy'), or velar (e.g. 'stress').\n\nVoiceless stops are unaspirated and with a very short voice onset time. They may be lightly voiced in rapid speech, especially when intervocalic. 's exact place of articulation ranges from alveolar to denti-alveolar, to dental. It may be fricated in rapid speech, and very rarely, in function words, it is deleted. and are reduced to lesser degrees in rapid speech.\n\nVoiced stops are prenasalised as reflected in the orthography to varying extents, or not at all. The nasal component—when present—does not increase the duration of the stop's closure; as such, prenasalised voiced stops would be most accurately transcribed or , depending on the length of the nasal component. Word-initially and after or , they are very rarely, if ever, prenasalised. In rapid and casual speech, prenasalisation is generally rarer, and voiced stops may be lenited to fricatives. This also accounts for Greeks having trouble disambiguating voiced stops, nasalised voiced stops, and nasalised voiceless stops in borrowings and names from foreign languages; for example, \"d\", \"nd\", and \"nt\", which are all written ντ in Greek.\n\nThe only Greek rhotic is prototypically an alveolar tap , often retracted (). It may be an alveolar approximant intervocalically, and is usually a trill in clusters, with two or three short cycles.\n\nGreek has palatals that contrast with velars before , but in complementary distribution with velars before front vowels . and occur as allophones of and , respectively, in CJV (consonant–glide–vowel) clusters, in analyses that posit an archiphoneme-like glide /J/ that contrasts with the vowel . All palatals may be analysed in the same way. The palatal stops and fricatives are somewhat retracted, and and are somewhat fronted. is best described as a postalveolar, and as alveolo-palatal.\n\nFinally, Greek has two phonetically affricate clusters, and . is reluctant to treat these as phonemes on the grounds of inconclusive research into their phonological behaviour.\n\nThe table below, adapted from , displays a near-full array of consonant phones in Standard Modern Greek.\n\nSome assimilatory processes mentioned above also occur across word boundaries. In particular, this goes for a number of grammatical words ending in , most notably the negation particles and and the accusative forms of the personal pronoun and definite article and . If these words are followed by a voiceless stop, either assimilates for place of articulation to the stop, or is altogether deleted, and the stop becomes voiced. This results in pronunciations such as ('the father' ) or ('it doesn't matter'), instead of and . The precise extent of assimilation may vary according to dialect, speed and formality of speech.\n\nGreek has a simple system of five vowels :\n\nThere is no phonemic length distinction, but vowels in stressed syllables are pronounced somewhat longer than in unstressed syllables. Furthermore, vowels in stressed syllables are more peripheral, but the difference is not large. In casual speech, unstressed and in the vicinity of voiceless consonants may become devoiced or even elided.\n\nUnlike Ancient Greek, which had a pitch accent system, Modern Greek has variable (phonologically unpredictable) stress. Every multisyllabic word carries stress on one of its three final syllables. Enclitics form a single phonological word together with the host word to which they attach, and count towards the three-syllable rule too. In these cases, primary stress shifts to the second-to-last syllable (e.g. 'my car'). Phonetically, stressed syllables are longer and/or carry higher amplitude.\n\nThe position of the stress can vary between different inflectional forms of the same word within its inflectional paradigm. In some paradigms, the stress is always on the third last syllable, shifting its position in those forms that have longer affixes (e.g. 'I called' vs. 'we called'; 'problem' vs. 'problems'). In some word classes, stress position also preserves an older pattern inherited from Ancient Greek, according to which a word could not be accented on the third-from-last syllable if the last syllable was long, e.g. ('man', nom. sg., last syllable short), but ('of men', gen. pl., last syllable long). However, in Modern Greek this rule is no longer automatic and does not apply to all words (e.g. 'monk', 'of monks'), as the phonological length distinction itself no longer exists.\n\nThis sample text, the first sentence of the fable of The North Wind and the Sun in Greek, and the accompanying transcription are adapted from .\n\n"}

They are often treated as being two dialects of the same language, but they are very different and mutual intelligibility is low. The languages are Tundra Nenets, the bigger language of the two in number of speakers, spoken by some 30,000 to 40,000 people in an area stretching from the Kanin Peninsula to the Yenisei River; and Forest Nenets, spoken by 1,000 to 1,500 people around the Agan, Pur, Lyamin and Nadym rivers.\n\nThe Nenets languages are classified in the Uralic language family, making them distantly related to some national languages spoken in Europe – namely Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian – in addition to other minority languages spoken in Russia. Both of the Nenets languages have been greatly influenced by Russian. Tundra Nenets has, to a lesser degree, been influenced by Komi, and Northern Khanty. Forest Nenets has also been influenced by Eastern Khanty. Tundra Nenets is well documented, considering its status as an indigenous and minority language, also having a literary tradition going back to the 1930s, while Forest Nenets was first written during the 1990s and is only very little documented.\n\nApart from the word 'Nenets', only one other Nenets word has entered the English language: 'parka', their traditional long hooded jacket made from skins and sometimes fur.\n\nTundra Nenets has 16 moods, most of which reflect different degrees of certainty in what in English might be called indicative statements or different degrees of force in what in English might be called imperative commands. An overarching feature of the Nenets languages is the introduction of systematic palatalization of almost all consonants. This originates from contrasts between different vowel qualities in the Proto-Samoyedic language.\nThe velar consonants *k and *ŋ were additionally shifted to *sʲ and *nʲ when palatalized.\n\nSimilar changes have also occurred in the other Samoyedic languages spoken in the tundra zone: Enets, Nganasan and the extinct Yurats.\n\nTundra Nenets generally has remained closer to Proto-Nenets than Forest Nenets, whose phonology has been influenced by eastern Khanty dialects.

Some researchers who consider it more closely related to Mường find that those who connect it more closely with Vietnamese are more influenced by ethnographic and/or political concerns than linguistic evidence. Chamberlain (2003) and Sidwell (2009) count it as a third Viet–Muong language.\n\nMost Nguồn live in Tuyên Hóa District (alongside the neighboring Sách people, a subgroup of the Chứt people who also speak a Vietic language) and in Minh Hoá District (living with the neighboring Việt peoples).\n\nThere are also Nguồn living in Laos, but with conflicting reports as to their exact location. According to Chamberlain (1998), there is a Nguồn village in central Laos known as Ban Pak Phanang in Boualapha District, Khammouane Province.\n\nChéon (1907), Maspéro (1912), and Cuisinier (1948) considered Nguồn to be more closely related to Mường while Mạc (1964), Nguyễn Đ. B. (1975), and Phạm (1975) connected it with Vietnamese.\n\nLater linguistic comparison by Nguyễn V. T. (1975) and Nguyễn Ph. Ph. (1996) suggest a closer link with the Mường dialects, and this is echoed by Barker (1993) (and others).\n\nJerold A. Edmondson, Kenneth J. Gregerson, and Nguyen Van Loi mention that this language is of \"great interest to those studying the history of Vietic languages\" due to its distinct historical developments.\n\nNguyễn V. T. (1975) notes that Nguồn speakers can communicate with Mường speakers with each speaking their own language, but Vietnamese speakers who do not know Mường cannot understand Nguồn.\n\nAlthough closer to Mường generally (especially concerning sound system similarities), in some aspects Nguồn is more similar to Vietnamese. For example, the negative marker in Vietnamese is the particle \"không\", which is ultimately a loanword from Chinese that became grammaticalized. The native negative marker \"chẳng\", which is attested in earlier stages of Vietnamese, was largely replaced by the Chinese borrowing. Mường, in contrast, has preserved the original \"chẳng\". Nguồn has, like Vietnamese, lost \"chẳng\" to \"không\". In this feature of the loss of the native negative marker, Nguồn is like Vietnamese rather than Mường.\n\nNguyễn Ph. Ph. (1996) notes that there are two varieties of Nguồn:\n\n\nCổ Liêm is named after the village of the same name; Yên Thọ is the name of a cooperative in Tân Hoá village.\n\nThe Yên Thọ variety is closer to Vietnamese than Cổ Liêm with respect to certain phonological developments.\n\nIn 1905, Cadière reported that the Nguồn (as well as the Sách people) were to be found in valleys of the Nguồn Năn river in eleven villages. Originally there were two groups of five villages. The northern group was in Cơ Sa \"canton\" (along with some Việt villages) and consisted of the following villages:\n\n\nTân Kiều was later split into two villages resulting in a sixth village in the northern group:\n\n\nThe more southerly village group consisted of\n\n\nMạc (1964) and Nguyễn Đ. B. (1975) assert that Nguồn is an original Việt group from the area of the Hà Tĩnh and Nghệ An provinces who moved into their present territory by the 17th century. Evidence for this opinion is based on family records. Mạc (1964) also reports that most Nguồn declared themselves to be Việt on the 1960 census.\n\nNguyễn V. T. (1975) suggests that the Mường could have migrated further south than Nghệ An to as far as Quảng Bình. Although some Việt families may have migrated to this region, they may have done so after Mường groups had already been established in the area. These Việt migrants could, then, have assimilated in language to the Mường. This Mường variety also would have been in contact with Chứt languages, like Sách. Thus, Nguyễn V. T. (1975) suggests that Nguồn is a variety of Mường spoken by Mường (possibly Hà Tĩnh Mường) and assimilated Việt people with influences from Chứt languages.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12119751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12119751", "title": "Resultative", "text": "Resultative\n\nIn linguistics, a resultative (abbreviated ) is a form that expresses that something or someone has undergone a change in state as the result of the completion of an event. Resultatives appear as predicates of sentences, and are generally composed of a \nverb (denoting the event) a postverbal noun phrase (denoting the entity that has undergone a change) and a so-called resultative phrase (denoting the state achieved as the result of the action named by the verb) which may be represented by an adjective, a prepositional phrase, or a particle, among others. For example, in the English sentence \"The man wiped the table clean\", the adjective \"clean\" denotes the state achieved by \"the table\" as a result of the event described as \"the man wiped\".\n\nResultative constructions are set syntactic patterns used to express resultativeness. Within these structures, the object NP is viewed as having undergone some change of state, and the change is viewed as a result achieved through the action expressed by the combination of the verb and the result phrase. The word order of the elements is said to be constant and crucial in conveying the resultative meaning; under this analysis, the output in its entirety is regarded as having a more complex meaning than the sum of its components' individual meanings. This constructional approach has been proposed in order to account for the semantic differences between standalone verbs that have no intrinsic resultative meaning and their resultative counterparts (e.g. \"hammer\" versus \"hammer flat\").\n\nResultative constructions can be described in the framework of a sign-oriented approach: morphological signals and word order signals (based on the ordering of lexical items) interact in order to create meaning. This interaction generates a system of oppositions based on two types of differentiation: differentiation of the referent from other referents in the lexicon and differentiation of the referent from itself.\n\nSemantically, resultative constructions can be part of one of four major classes: causative, non-causative, property or path resultatives. These classes are distinguished by the relation between the noun phrase undergoing the change expressed by the resultative (referred to as the host) and the resultative construction itself.\n\nIn causative resultatives, the host is the direct object of the resultative construction; the subject causes the host to undergo a change. In noncausative resultatives, the host is the subject of the resultative construction; the sentence states a change of state or position.\n\nIn property resultatives, the host comes to have the property expressed by the resultative construction. In path resultatives, the resultative construction describes a path that is traversed by the host.\n\nDefining the role and category of resultatives has inspired numerous approaches from linguists. Traditionally, certain tenses and aspects have been attributed to resultatives. Namely, the present perfect aspect is pointed to in explaining resultative constructions like \"I have written them a letter\". There is a stress on the sense of completeness inherent in resultatives: A: Have you cleaned the windows? B: No, I haven't finished them yet.\nB* Yes, but I haven't finished them yet\n\nIn this example, answering negatively entails that either some or none of the windows have been cleaned, but you cannot answer positively unless the entire task is completed. The task does not require successful completion as found in the example \"He has not passed his exam\".\n\nIt has been demonstrated, however, that resultatives exist independently of the perfect in sentences like \"I turned this offer down\", creating the need to reexamine the role of resultatives. To address this, it has been claimed that the resultative expresses both a state and the preceding action it has resulted from. This emphasizes that the resultative describes how a state was acted upon. Therefore, it must use the passive form. However, this analysis does not account for phrases such as \"I turned this offer down\", which uses the active rather than the passive voice.\n\nSign-oriented analyses present an aspectual contrast, in which the approach is based on the boundaries of predication within a time-field. An action is perceived as a whole within a predication or it could be perceived as the predication within the boundaries. \nA markedness relationship is one between the perfective and imperfective. This analysis argues against the view that the resultative meaning is identical to the perfect. Below are sentences where the verbs in the perfect do not have the ‘element of result’ in their meaning:\n\n\"I’ve seen it before.\"\n\"It’s only been three or four times that we’ve come face to face.\"\n\nIn the sentences above ‘the element of result’ does not seem apparent. It is argued that the concrete result and the result phase should be distinguished from each other.\n\nThis aspectual approach shows the relation between an action and its result. The Guillaumean approach posits that the English verb has two moments, one where any duration, any developments, or any actualizations take place with the event’s duration.\nYet another approach to resultativeness views it as “a fundamental semantic distinctive feature which cuts across almost all traditional categories: verb, noun, adjective, infinitive, gerund, participle, particle, auxiliary”. It is claimed that the resultative should be a distinctive feature in language instead of being a subcategory within the verbal aspect realm.\n\nThis approach suggests the idea of viewing resultativeness as a system of oppositions. It hypothesizes that the resultative is not restricted to a tense or an aspect form. It suggests that the resultativeness is expressed by oppositions of marked/unmarked forms throughout all language levels and subsystems. Markedness is a system that contrasts two language forms as distinguished based on simplicity and frequency of usage.(For example, irregular verbs will be marked, whereas regular verbs will be unmarked)\n\nThese subsystems includes: morpheme, auxiliaries, lexical pairs, compounds, verb complements, tense aspect and voice forms, syntactic patters, types of sentences, word order, stress, and intonation.\n\nGorlach, in her book, proposes that resultativeness happens depending whether the subsystem is marked or not. For example, in the sentence \"I am wiping the table\" the affix -ing is unmarked and expresses neutral state instead of resultative state. -ed, on the other hand, is unmarked form of affix, thus making the following sentence express resultativeness: \"I wiped the table\".\n\nExtended list of marked/unmarked form of all language subsystems can be found in the table.\n\nA resultative is either an adjectival phrase indicating the state of a noun resulting from the completion of the event denoted by the verb, or a verbal construction denoting the result state of an event. This verbal construction type of resultative is usually considered part of the field of aspect.\n\nThis type of resultative is a phrase that indicates the state of a noun resulting from the completion of the verb. In the English examples below, the affected noun is shown in bold and the resulting predicate is in \"italics\":\n\n\nSubjects of passive and unaccusative verbs may participate in resultative constructions:\n\n\nSubjects of unergative verbs may also participate in resultative constructions, but a \"dummy object\", that is, an otherwise absent reflexive pronoun must be inserted:\n\n\nResultatives are distinct from depictive constructions, though often both a resultative and a depictive reading is possible from the same sentence. For example, in \"John fried the fish dry\", a resultative reading suggests that as a result of John's frying, the fish became dry. On the other hand, also possible is a depictive reading in which John is already dry, and that is the state in which he is frying the fish (because e.g. he had been back from the beach for long enough to be dry). Both depictives and resultatives are important in the understanding of small clauses because their exact properties seem to vary considerably from language to language.\n\nIn German, some verbs can occur in adjectival resultative sentences while others cannot. In the example below, an argument can be made that the noun phrase after the verb can be interpreted as a verb argument.\n\nThis sort of resultative is a grammatical aspect construction that indicates the result state of the event denoted by the verb. English does not have a productive resultative construction. It is widely accepted that the \"be\"-perfects of various European languages (e.g. French, Italian, German, and Dutch) began as resultative constructions.\n\nMandarin places the resultative within an verb aspect construction. \n\nIn this example, the resultative \"ganjing\" is situated within the verb aspect construction. The verb \"ca-\" takes the theta roles of agent and experiencer. Resultative phrases may also take multiple theta-roles. The linguist Fengqi Li calls these “composite roles”.\n\nHere, the theta-roles are agent, experiencer and instrument. The experiencer and instrument are both the ax, but they take composite roles. The verb cut is transitive and therefore requires a direct object. The composite role allows the knife to undergo its own action.\n\nThe resultative construction in English might be represented as SVO AP.\n\nThe Japanese translation of the sentences a. and b. in the above table would have two distinct constructions. The first construction has a complex verb strategy, where V is the causative change of state verb, or result state corresponding to the AP in English construction. V is a verb of simple activity, which corresponds to V in the English construction.\n"}

One can have stamps of one design on half of the sheet and the second design on the other half. In this case, the only se-tenants would be in the center where the two halves meet. A more frequent set-up is to have pairs of differing stamps throughout the sheet. Sometimes when two different designs appear on a single pane, the stamps are arranged like a checkerboard, with the different designs alternating in each row and column horizontally and vertically. One can have a triptych, or a tête-bêche format (head to toe). Stamp booklets often contain se-tenant stamps or labels.\n\nFour of the U. S. Postmasters' Provisional stamp issues distributed between 1845 and 1847 were se-tenant productions: the Baltimore Postmaster’s provisionals (two different images [5¢ and 10¢] on a sheet of twelve), the St. Louis Bears (three different images [5¢, 10¢ and 20¢] on a sheet of six), the (two different images [5¢ and 10¢] on a sheet of twelve) and the Alexandria Postmaster's Provisionals (a pair of not-quite-identical 5¢ images).

{"id": "27763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27763", "title": "Structuralism", "text": "Structuralism\n\nIn sociology, anthropology, and linguistics, structuralism is the methodology that implies elements of human culture must be understood by way of their relationship to a broader, overarching system or structure. It works to uncover the structures that underlie all the things that humans do, think, perceive, and feel. Alternatively, as summarized by philosopher Simon Blackburn, structuralism is \"the belief of alien life that is not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture\".\n\nStructuralism in Europe developed in the early 1900s, in the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure and the subsequent Prague, Moscow and Copenhagen schools of linguistics. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when structural linguistics was facing serious challenges from the likes of Noam Chomsky and thus fading in importance, an array of scholars in the humanities borrowed Saussure's concepts for use in their respective fields of study. French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss was arguably the first such scholar, sparking a widespread interest in structuralism.\n\nThe structuralist mode of reasoning has been applied in a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, psychology, literary criticism, economics and architecture. The most prominent thinkers associated with structuralism include Claude Lévi-Strauss, linguist Roman Jakobson, and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. As an intellectual movement, structuralism was initially presumed to be the heir apparent to existentialism. However, by the late 1960s, many of structuralism's basic tenets came under attack from a new wave of predominantly French intellectuals such as the philosopher and historian Michel Foucault, the philosopher Jacques Derrida, the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, and the literary critic Roland Barthes. Though elements of their work necessarily relate to structuralism and are informed by it, these theorists have generally been referred to as post-structuralists. In the 1970s, structuralism was criticized for its rigidity and ahistoricism. Despite this, many of structuralism's proponents, such as Lacan, continue to assert an influence on continental philosophy and many of the fundamental assumptions of some of structuralism's post-structuralist critics are a continuation of structuralism.\n\nThe term \"structuralism\" is a related term that describes a particular philosophical/literary movement or moment. The term appeared in the works of French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss and gave rise in France to the \"structuralist movement,\" which influenced the thinking of other writers such as Louis Althusser, the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, as well as the structural Marxism of Nicos Poulantzas, most of whom disavowed themselves as being a part of this movement.\nThe origins of structuralism connect with the work of Ferdinand de Saussure on linguistics, along with the linguistics of the Prague and Moscow schools. In brief, Saussure's structural linguistics propounded three related concepts.\n\nProponents of structuralism would argue that a specific domain of culture may be understood by means of a structure—modelled on language—that is distinct both from the organizations of reality and those of ideas or the imagination—the \"third order\". In Lacan's psychoanalytic theory, for example, the structural order of \"the Symbolic\" is distinguished both from \"the Real\" and \"the Imaginary\"; similarly, in Althusser's Marxist theory, the structural order of the capitalist mode of production is distinct both from the actual, real agents involved in its relations and from the ideological forms in which those relations are understood.\n\nBlending Freud and Saussure, the French (post)structuralist Jacques Lacan applied structuralism to psychoanalysis and, in a different way, Jean Piaget applied structuralism to the study of psychology. But Jean Piaget, who would better define himself as constructivist, considers structuralism as \"a method and not a doctrine\" because for him \"there exists no structure without a construction, abstract or genetic\".\n\nAlthough the French theorist Louis Althusser is often associated with a brand of structural social analysis which helped give rise to \"structural Marxism\", such association was contested by Althusser himself in the Italian foreword to the second edition of \"Reading Capital\". In this foreword Althusser states the following: \n\nDespite the precautions we took to distinguish ourselves from the 'structuralist' ideology ..., despite the decisive intervention of categories foreign to 'structuralism' ..., the terminology we employed was too close in many respects to the 'structuralist' terminology not to give rise to an ambiguity. With a very few exceptions ... our interpretation of Marx has generally been recognized and judged, in homage to the current fashion, as 'structuralist'... We believe that despite the terminological ambiguity, the profound tendency of our texts was not attached to the 'structuralist' ideology.\nIn a later development, feminist theorist Alison Assiter enumerated four ideas that she says are common to the various forms of structuralism. First, that a structure determines the position of each element of a whole. Second, that every system has a structure. Third, structural laws deal with co-existence rather than change. Fourth, structures are the \"real things\" that lie beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.\n\nIn \"Course in General Linguistics\" the analysis focuses not on the \"use\" of language (called \"\"parole\", or speech), but rather on the underlying system of language (called \"langue\"\"). This approach examines how the elements of language relate to each other in the present, synchronically rather than diachronically. Saussure argued that linguistic signs were composed of two parts:\n\n\nThis was quite different from previous approaches that focused on the relationship between words and the things in the world that they designate. Other key notions in structural linguistics include paradigm, syntagm, and value (though these notions were not fully developed in Saussure's thought). A structural \"idealism\" is a class of linguistic units (lexemes, morphemes or even constructions) that are possible in a certain position in a given linguistic environment (such as a given sentence), which is called the \"syntagm\". The different functional role of each of these members of the paradigm is called \"value\" (\"\" in French).\n\nSaussure's \"Course\" influenced many linguists between World War I and World War II. In the United States, for instance, Leonard Bloomfield developed his own version of structural linguistics, as did Louis Hjelmslev in Denmark and Alf Sommerfelt in Norway. In France Antoine Meillet and Émile Benveniste continued Saussure's project, and members of the Prague school of linguistics such as Roman Jakobson and Nikolai Trubetzkoy conducted research that would be greatly influential. However, by the 1950s Saussure's linguistic concepts were under heavy criticism and were soon largely abandoned by practicing linguists: \n\nSaussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refer to Chomsky.\nThe clearest and most important example of Prague school structuralism lies in phonemics. Rather than simply compiling a list of which sounds occur in a language, the Prague school sought to examine how they were related. They determined that the inventory of sounds in a language could be analysed in terms of a series of contrasts. Thus in English the sounds /p/ and /b/ represent distinct phonemes because there are cases (minimal pairs) where the contrast between the two is the only difference between two distinct words (e.g. 'pat' and 'bat'). Analyzing sounds in terms of contrastive features also opens up comparative scope—it makes clear, for instance, that the difficulty Japanese speakers have differentiating /r/ and /l/ in English is because these sounds are not contrastive in Japanese. Phonology would become the paradigmatic basis for structuralism in a number of different fields.\n\nAccording to structural theory in anthropology and social anthropology, meaning is produced and reproduced within a culture through various practices, phenomena and activities that serve as systems of signification. A structuralist approach may study activities as diverse as food-preparation and serving rituals, religious rites, games, literary and non-literary texts, and other forms of entertainment to discover the deep structures by which meaning is produced and reproduced within the culture. For example, Lévi-Strauss analysed in the 1950s cultural phenomena including mythology, kinship (the alliance theory and the incest taboo), and food preparation. In addition to these studies, he produced more linguistically focused writings in which he applied Saussure's distinction between \"langue\" and \"parole\" in his search for the fundamental structures of the human mind, arguing that the structures that form the \"deep grammar\" of society originate in the mind and operate in people unconsciously. Lévi-Strauss took inspiration from mathematics.\n\nAnother concept used in structural anthropology came from the Prague school of linguistics, where Roman Jakobson and others analysed sounds based on the presence or absence of certain features (such as voiceless vs. voiced). Lévi-Strauss included this in his conceptualization of the universal structures of the mind, which he held to operate based on pairs of binary oppositions such as hot-cold, male-female, culture-nature, cooked-raw, or marriageable vs. tabooed women.\n\nA third influence came from Marcel Mauss (1872–1950), who had written on gift-exchange systems. Based on Mauss, for instance, Lévi-Strauss argued that kinship systems are based on the exchange of women between groups (a position known as 'alliance theory') as opposed to the 'descent'-based theory described by Edward Evans-Pritchard and Meyer Fortes. While replacing Marcel Mauss at his \"Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes\" chair, Lévi-Strauss' writing became widely popular in the 1960s and 1970s and gave rise to the term \"structuralism\" itself.\n\nIn Britain, authors such as Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach were highly influenced by structuralism. Authors such as Maurice Godelier and Emmanuel Terray combined Marxism with structural anthropology in France. In the United States, authors such as Marshall Sahlins and James Boon built on structuralism to provide their own analysis of human society. Structural anthropology fell out of favour in the early 1980s for a number of reasons. D'Andrade suggests that this was because it made unverifiable assumptions about the universal structures of the human mind. Authors such as Eric Wolf argued that political economy and colonialism should be at the forefront of anthropology. More generally, criticisms of structuralism by Pierre Bourdieu led to a concern with how cultural and social structures were changed by human agency and practice, a trend which Sherry Ortner has referred to as 'practice theory'.\n\nSome anthropological theorists, however, while finding considerable fault with Lévi-Strauss's version of structuralism, did not turn away from a fundamental structural basis for human culture. The Biogenetic Structuralism group for instance argued that some kind of structural foundation for culture must exist because all humans inherit the same system of brain structures. They proposed a kind of neuroanthropology which would lay the foundations for a more complete scientific account of cultural similarity and variation by requiring an integration of cultural anthropology and neuroscience—a program that theorists such as Victor Turner also embraced.\n\nIn literary theory, structuralist criticism relates literary texts to a larger structure, which may be a particular genre, a range of intertextual connections, a model of a universal narrative structure, or a system of recurrent patterns or motifs.Structuralism argues that there must be a structure in every text, which explains why it is easier for experienced readers than for non-experienced readers to interpret a text. Hence, everything that is written seems to be governed by specific rules, or a \"grammar of literature\", that one learns in educational institutions and that are to be unmasked.\n\nA potential problem of structuralist interpretation is that it can be highly reductive, as scholar Catherine Belsey puts it: \"the structuralist danger of collapsing all difference.\" An example of such a reading might be if a student concludes the authors of \"West Side Story\" did not write anything \"really\" new, because their work has the same structure as Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\". In both texts a girl and a boy fall in love (a \"formula\" with a symbolic operator between them would be \"Boy + Girl\") despite the fact that they belong to two groups that hate each other (\"Boy's Group - Girl's Group\" or \"Opposing forces\") and conflict is resolved by their death. Structuralist readings focus on how the structures of the single text resolve inherent narrative tensions. If a structuralist reading focuses on multiple texts, there must be some way in which those texts unify themselves into a coherent system. The versatility of structuralism is such that a literary critic could make the same claim about a story of two \"friendly\" families (\"Boy's Family + Girl's Family\") that arrange a marriage between their children despite the fact that the children hate each other (\"Boy - Girl\") and then the children commit suicide to escape the arranged marriage; the justification is that the second story's structure is an 'inversion' of the first story's structure: the relationship between the values of love and the two pairs of parties involved have been reversed.\n\nStructuralistic literary criticism argues that the \"literary banter of a text\" can lie only in new structure, rather than in the specifics of character development and voice in which that structure is expressed. Literary structuralism often follows the lead of Vladimir Propp, Algirdas Julien Greimas, and Claude Lévi-Strauss in seeking out basic deep elements in stories, myths, and more recently, anecdotes, which are combined in various ways to produce the many versions of the ur-story or ur-myth.\n\nThere is considerable similarity between structural literary theory and Northrop Frye's archetypal criticism, which is also indebted to the anthropological study of myths. Some critics have also tried to apply the theory to individual works, but the effort to find unique structures in individual literary works runs counter to the structuralist program and has an affinity with New Criticism.\n\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s, existentialism, such as that propounded by Jean-Paul Sartre, was the dominant European intellectual movement. Structuralism rose to prominence in France in the wake of existentialism, particularly in the 1960s. The initial popularity of structuralism in France led to its spread across the globe.\n\nStructuralism rejected the concept of human freedom and choice and focused instead on the way that human experience and thus, behaviour, is determined by various structures. The most important initial work on this score was Claude Lévi-Strauss's 1949 volume \"The Elementary Structures of Kinship\". Lévi-Strauss had known Jakobson during their time together at the New School in New York during WWII and was influenced by both Jakobson's structuralism as well as the American anthropological tradition. In \"Elementary Structures\" he examined kinship systems from a structural point of view and demonstrated how apparently different social organizations were in fact different permutations of a few basic kinship structures. In the late 1950s he published \"Structural Anthropology\", a collection of essays outlining his program for structuralism.\n\nBy the early 1960s structuralism as a movement was coming into its own and some believed that it offered a single unified approach to human life that would embrace all disciplines. Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida focused on how structuralism could be applied to literature.\n\nThe so-called \"Gang of Four\" of structuralism was Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, Barthes, and Foucault.\n\nStructuralism is less popular today than other approaches, such as post-structuralism and deconstruction. Structuralism has often been criticized for being ahistorical and for favouring deterministic structural forces over the ability of people to act. As the political turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s (and particularly the student uprisings of May 1968) began affecting academia, issues of power and political struggle moved to the center of people's attention.\n\nIn the 1980s, deconstruction—and its emphasis on the fundamental ambiguity of language rather than its crystalline logical structure—became popular. By the end of the century structuralism was seen as an historically important school of thought, but the movements that it spawned, rather than structuralism itself, commanded attention.\n\nSeveral social thinkers and academics have strongly criticized structuralism or even dismissed it \"in toto\". The French hermeneutic philosopher Paul Ricœur (1969) criticized Lévi-Strauss for constantly overstepping the limits of validity of the structuralist approach, ending up in what Ricœur described as \"a Kantianism without a transcendental subject\". Anthropologist Adam Kuper (1973) argued that \"'Structuralism' came to have something of the momentum of a millennial movement and some of its adherents felt that they formed a secret society of the seeing in a world of the blind. Conversion was not just a matter of accepting a new paradigm. It was, almost, a question of salvation.\" Philip Noel Pettit (1975) called for an abandoning of \"the positivist dream which Lévi-Strauss dreamed for semiology\" arguing that semiology is not to be placed among the natural sciences. Cornelius Castoriadis (1975) criticized structuralism as failing to explain symbolic mediation in the social world; he viewed structuralism as a variation on the \"logicist\" theme, and he argued that, contrary to what structuralists advocate, language—and symbolic systems in general—cannot be reduced to logical organizations on the basis of the binary logic of oppositions. Critical theorist Jürgen Habermas (1985) accused structuralists, such as Foucault, of being positivists; he remarked that while Foucault is not an ordinary positivist, he nevertheless paradoxically uses the tools of science to criticize science (see \"Performative contradiction\" and \"Foucault–Habermas debate\"). Sociologist Anthony Giddens (1993) is another notable critic; while Giddens draws on a range of structuralist themes in his theorizing, he dismisses the structuralist view that the reproduction of social systems is merely \"a mechanical outcome\".\n\n\n\n"}

Human voices are very prone to change with the speaker's mood and several other factors that aren't programmed into computerized voices. Voice font software on the Macintosh system tries to get around this by providing tags to change some components of the voice, such as pitch. The Natural Voices software in the sources section allows defining acronym pronunciation and speech rate, as well as other things. Even though speech synthesis has existed since around 1930, according to that source, and the Speech synthesis article, it is difficult to fool experienced listeners into believing that the voice is indeed human.\n\nThis may be similar to the difficulty in achieving true Artificial Intelligence that can actually pass a Turing Test by presenting spectators with something indistinguishable from what it is trying to simulate.\n\nLike its text counterpart, each voice font can supply a different experience and provide a selection for different purposes. The simplest one is to select a voice font from a group in order to get the clearest one, or to choose the one with a speed that is appropriate for different settings.\n\nFor people who are hard of hearing in the upper range of the hearing spectrum, for example, selecting a voice that uses a lower pitch will deliver deeper sounds.\n\nAnother use for voice fonts is in electronic music. A commonly available set of synthetic voices from Macintosh computers can be used to enhance the mood of certain music pieces that need a voice but where the composer feels that providing a human voice is not in their interests. Here, male voices can be combined in a choir to provide the tenor and bass for a particular piece, and female voices can be added to fill in other parts of the ensemble—resulting in a choir that consists of speech synthesis rather than human singers, or to utilize a female voice when none are available.\n\nCertain Macintosh clients of instant messaging services such as AOL Instant Messenger have had the option of reading incoming messages using the system's voice fonts. When message receiver has stepped away from the computer, or temporarily put away the part of the screen showing the incoming text, the computer reads the message out loud. This allows the user to continue with their other tasks without needing to view the incoming text.\n\n\n\n"}
