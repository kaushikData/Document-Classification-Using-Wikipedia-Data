Commissioned for the pioneering Internet project \"24 Hours in Cyberspace\", it was written by John Perry Barlow, a founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and published online on February 8, 1996, from Davos, Switzerland. It was written primarily in response to the passing into law of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 in the United States. In 2014, the Department of Records recorded and released audio and video content of Barlow reading the Declaration.\n\nThe declaration sets out, in sixteen short paragraphs, a rebuttal to government of the Internet by any outside force, specifically the United States. It states that the United States did not have the consent of the governed to apply laws to the Internet, and that the Internet was outside any country's borders. Instead, the Internet was developing its own social contracts to determine how to handle its problems, based on the golden rule. It does this in language evocative of the United States Declaration of Independence and obliquely cites it in its final paragraphs. Although the paper mentions the Telecommunications Act, it also accuses China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, and Italy of stifling the Internet.\n\nAt the time the paper was written, Barlow had already written extensively on the Internet and its social and legal phenomena, as well as being a founding member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The work he was known best for previously, \"The Economy of Ideas\", published March 1994 in \"Wired\" magazine, also made allusions to Thomas Jefferson and some of the ideas he would write about in his declaration.\n\nBecause of its subject matter, Barlow's work quickly became famous and widely distributed on the Internet. Within three months, an estimated 5,000 websites had copies of the declaration. At nine months, that number was estimated to be 40,000. To approach Barlow's vision of a self-governing Internet, a virtual magistrate was set up by the Cyberspace Law Institute, now hosted by the Chicago-Kent College of Law. Magistrates would be appointed by the institute and other legal groups to solve online disputes. The declaration has been criticized for internal inconsistencies. The declaration's assertion that 'cyberspace' is a place removed from the physical world has also been challenges by people who point to the fact that the internet is always linked to its underlying geography.\n\nOutside the Internet, the response was less positive. Larry Irving, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce, said that a lack of safeguards would \"slow down the growth of what is likely to be a major boon for consumers and business\". In the online magazine \"HotWired\", one columnist referred to his document as simply \"hogwash\".\n\nBy 2002 the number of sites copying the declaration was estimated to have dropped to 20,000. In 2004, Barlow reflected on his 1990s work, specifically regarding his optimism. His response was that \"we all get older and smarter\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2411672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2411672", "title": "Abomination of desolation", "text": "Abomination of desolation\n\nThe abomination of desolation, abomination that makes desolate, or desolating sacrilege (Hebrew: , \"ha-shikkuts meshomem\") is a term found in the Book of Daniel which means literally \"an abomination that desolates\" or \"an abomination that appalls\".\n\nThe word \"abomination\" is described as a \"detestable act\" or \"detestable thing\" and in both biblical and rabbinic Hebrew, is a familiar term for an idol, or pertains to idolatrous worship, and therefore may well have the same application in Daniel, which should accordingly be rendered, in agreement with \"motionless abomination\" or, also, \"appalling abomination\". Some scholars—Hoffmann, Nestle, Bevan, and others—suggest that as a designation for Jupiter it is simply an intentional perversion of his usual appellation \"Baal Shamem\" (\"lord of heaven\") is quite plausible, as attested by the perversion of Beelzebub into \"Βεελζεβούλ\" (Greek version) in , as well as the express injunction found in Tosef., 'Ab. Zarah, vi. (vii) and Babli 'Ab. Zarah, 46a that the names of idols may be pronounced only in a distorted or abbreviated form.\n\nThe phrase \"abomination of desolation\" ( \"ha-šiqqūṣ məšōmêm\") is found in three places in the Book of Daniel, all within the literary context of apocalyptic visions.\n\nIn the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark, the term (Greek τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως, \"to bdelygma tēs erēmōseōs\") is used by Jesus in the Olivet discourse. In the Matthean account, Jesus is presented as quoting Daniel explicitly. In the Gospel of Mark, the phrase \"spoken of by Daniel the prophet\" is absent in the Codex Sinaiticus.\n\nIn Luke's version of Jesus' warning, the abomination is not mentioned, and the sign that it is time to flee Jerusalem is explicitly said to be that Jerusalem would be surrounded by armies.\n\nAccording to Roman historian Cassius Dio, after the Temple was destroyed in 70 AD the worship overseen by the High Priest ceased. The Temple Mount was covered over with rubble and a pagan temple dedicated to Jupiter was built when Hadrian became Caesar (117 - 138 AD). Hadrian installed on the mount two statues: one of Jupiter and another of himself; this was seen by the Jews as idolatry. In addition, Hadrian expelled the Jews from Jerusalem altogether, only allowing them into the city on the fast of Tisha B'av (the ninth day of the lunar month of Av), a day of mourning for the destruction of the First and the Second Jewish Temples. This appears to have caused a second Jewish revolt with the intent of recapturing Jerusalem and restoring the Temple. In response, Rome sent six full legions with auxiliaries and elements from up to six additional legions, which finally managed to crush the revolt. The temple appears to have been rebuilt during the early Umayyad period as the al-Aqsa Mosque, which stands on the site today. \n\nThere is a rabbinical consensus that the expression refers to the 168 BC desecration of the Second Temple by the erection of a Zeus statue in its sacred precincts by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (the flashpoint of the Maccabean Revolt). Some rabbis, however, see in it an allusion to Manasseh, who was reported to have set up \"a carved image ... in the house of God\".\n\nChurch Father Augustine of Hippo (379) states, \"For Luke very clearly bears witness that the prophecy of Daniel was fulfilled when Jerusalem was overthrown.\" (vol. 6, p. 170)\n\nJohn Chrysostom understood this to refer to the armies that surrounded Jerusalem and the factions fighting within it which preceded the destruction of the city.\n\nJohn Calvin rejects the rabbinical view and wrote \"In consequence of the obscurity of this passage it has been twisted in a variety of ways. At the end of the ninth chapter I have shewn the impossibility of its referring to the profanation of the Temple which occurred under the tyranny of Antiochus. On this occasion the angel bears witness to such a complete destruction of the Temple, as to leave no room for the hope of its repair and restoration. Then the circumstances of the time convinces us of this. For he then said, Christ shall confirm the covenant with many for one week, and shall cause the sacrifices and oblation to cease. Afterwards, the abomination that stupifieth shall be added, and desolation or stupor, and then death will distill, says he, upon the astonished or stupefied one. The angel, therefore, there treats of the perpetual devastation of the Temple. So in this passage, without doubt;, he treats of the period after the destruction of the Temple; there could be no hope of restoration, as the law with all its ceremonies would then arrive at its termination\" (Commentary on Daniel, vol. 2)\n\nJohn Wesley (1754) also rejects the rabbinical view and wrote, \"When ye shall see the abomination of desolation - Daniel's term is, 'The abomination that maketh desolate' (xi. 31); that is, the standards of the desolating legions, on which they bear the abominable images of their idols. Standing in the holy place - Not only the temple, and the mountain on which it stood, but the whole city of Jerusalem, and several furlongs of land round about it, were accounted holy; particularly the mountain on which our Lord now sat, and on which the Romans afterward planted their ensigns.\" \n\nSome claim the 1 Maccabees usage of the term pointing to an event prior to the prophecy given by Christ, in the actions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in the mid-2nd century BC. Specifically, he set up an altar, probably to Zeus or Baal Shamem, in the Second Temple in Jerusalem and sacrificed swine on it around the year 168 BC. Many modern scholars believe that Daniel 9:27, 11:31 and 12:11 are examples of \"vaticinium ex eventu\" (prophecies after the event) relating to Antiochus.\n\nMost modern scholars have concluded that Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14 are prophecies after the event about the siege of Jerusalem in AD 70 by the Roman general Titus, after the First Jewish Revolt, and subsequent destruction of the Jewish Temple.\n\nSome scholars, including Hermann Detering, see these verses as a \"vaticinium ex eventu\" about Emperor Hadrian's attempt to install the statue of Jupiter Capitolinus on the site of the ruined Jewish Temple in Jerusalem leading to the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132-135 AD.\n\nPreterists believe that Jesus quoted this prophecy in Mark 13:14 as referring to an event in his 1st century disciples' immediate future, such as the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD.\n\nOne commentator relates the prophecy to the actions of Caligula c. 40 AD when he ordered that a golden statue depicting himself as Zeus incarnate be set up in the Temple in Jerusalem. This prospect however, never came to fruition since he was assassinated in 41 AD along with his wife and daughter.\n\nSome, such as Peter Bolt, head of New Testament at Moore Theological College, claim that the abomination of desolation in Mark 13 refers to the crucifixion of the Son of God; in other words, Jesus is referring to his own impending death.\n\nIn his book, Discourses in Matthew, Lutheran theologian and professor of Systematic Theology and New Testament at Concordia Theological Seminary, Dr. David. P. Scaer, states,\n\nInterpreters with a futurist perspective think that Jesus' prophecy deals with a literal, end-times False Prophet. Futurists consider the abomination of desolation prophecy of Daniel mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14 to refer to an event in the future, when there appears \"the man of lawlessness\".\n\nPremillennialist futurists like Arthur Pink in his work \"The Antichrist\" attribute vast portions within the Old and New Testament to this future figure that will rise to global prominence politically, economically and militarily by setting up a governmental structure possessing sweeping powers over worship and the affairs of humanity.\n\nMethodist theologian Adam Clarke and Anglican bishop Thomas Newton interpret the abomination of desolation as a proverbial phrase that could include multiple events \"substituted in the place of, or set up in opposition to, the ordinances of God, his worship, his truth, etc.\" This allows for some or all of the examples in the following (incomplete) list to be viewed as partial fulfillments of this prophecy simultaneously:\n\n\nThe Joseph Smith–Matthew states (in verse 12) that the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel is the destruction of Jerusalem (first in AD 70). Later (in verse 32) it states that the abomination of desolation will be fulfilled again when at the end times, when Jerusalem is subject to much destruction before the Second Coming of Christ.\n\n\n"}

He was married to vicar's daughter Sigrid Marie Wexelsen (1866–1960) from August 1890.\n\nEriksen finished his secondary education at Kristiania Cathedral School in 1883. He then studied theology, graduating with the cand.theol. degree in theology in 1888. After working one year as a teacher in Ålesund he was appointer vicar in Karlsøy in 1891, and held this position until 1910, when he became vicar in Vålerengen Church. While being a priest he wrote his doctoral thesis, titled \"Vilje. En psykologisk afhandling\". He was founder and first editor of the newspaper \"Nordlys\" from 1902, and edited \"Nordlys\" until 1911. In 1913 he founded the publication \"Dagens Liv\", and edited it, but it soon became defunct. He published a popular book on the history of religion, \"Religionsbilleder og kulturskildringer\", in 1901, and a book on jurisprudence for ordinary people, \"Lovbok for folket\", in 1903.\n\nHe also became involved in politics, was elected mayor of Karlsøy for the Liberal Party in 1898, and re-elected in 1901 and 1904. He was a failed candidate for the 1900 general election; although his party swept the vote in Karlsøy, this was not enough to win the constituency Tromsø Amt. In 1903 he was elected to the Parliament of Norway, representing the Norwegian Labour Party. This was the first time members of the organized labour movement were represented in Parliament. The Labour Party went from 0 to 4 seats after the 1903 election, all representatives of Northern Norway. In addition to Lind Johansen, they were Meyer Foshaug, John Lind Johansen and Jørg Berge; also, Adam Egede-Nissen was elected on the Liberal Party ballot. He was re-elected to Parliament in 1906 and in 1909 for the constituency Tromsøsundet. He became known as one of the greatest speakers at the Parliament during this period, and his nickname \"Karlsøypresten\" became a well-known concept among the general public.\n\nHe was awarded the Medal for Outstanding Civic Service for his role as mediator in the 1911 lockout. Eriksen did not want to subordinate himself to the party discipline, and was eventually expelled from the Labour Party in 1912. Contributing to his downfall was his actions in the position as chairman of the society Riksmålsforbundet from 1911 to 1912. From then he was not politically active, but wrote numerous newspaper articles on cultural topics.\n\n"}
{"id": "25641120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25641120", "title": "American Sign Language literature", "text": "American Sign Language literature\n\nAmerican Sign Language literature (or ASL literature) refers to stories, poetry, dramatic productions, folk tales, and songs in American Sign Language. ASL literature can denote works translated from other literatures into ASL, like Patrick Graybill's translation of the poem \"Not Waving, but Drowning\", or more often, works composed originally in ASL itself. Other notable performers of ASL literature include Ben Bahan, Ella Mae Lentz, Sam Supalla, and Clayton Valli.\n\nEvery spoken language used today originated in a pre-written, or oral form. Because no widely accepted method has yet developed for recording American Sign Language in writing, it persists as a purely \"visual\" language. Only with the advent of film technology in the early 20th century could ASL be recorded, preserved, and distributed. The earliest example of recorded signing is a National Association of the Deaf compilation from between 1910 and 1920, containing various types of ASL discourse, including lectures, poems, stories, and songs.\n\nSince the first films of ASL lectures in the early twentieth century, more ASL performances were gradually recorded, which has affected the tradition. Today, a wide variety of ASL works is documented on video, and deaf performers continue to perform ASL stories, poems, and other works live to enthusiastic audiences at festivals, university events, clubs, and social gatherings. Each year, Gallaudet University, Deaf West Theater, and other deaf groups mount theatrical productions in ASL. Furthermore, many talented storytellers and poets perform works that are never recorded; video captures only a small percentage of ASL literature. The prevalence of digital video technology has allowed more signers to record their own ASL productions more easily and share them with more people than ever before. YouTube, Facebook, and Apple's Photo Booth have all contributed to wider exposure of original ASL creations.\n\nASL literary works often feature creative uses of signs, handshapes, facial expressions, and classifiers. Different performers have developed recognizably different styles and themes.\n\nOne common type of ASL literature is the \"ABC\" poem, performed by young children and adult ASL poets alike. This type of poem is characterized by the use of a series of handshapes that follows the order of the manual alphabet. There are a huge variety of signs that use each handshape in the alphabet, but poems will frequently use ASL classifiers (see American Sign Language grammar) that provide the poet much more room to exercise his own creativity. A closely related form of poetry is the handshape poem, in which an ASL poet performs a poem or narrative using a limited variety of handshapes. This constricts the poet in form, much as rhyme or meter does in written poetry, and requires a precise use of motion and non-manual expression. In \"Signing the Body Poetic\", the line of an ASL poem is designated by the fluidity of the transition between the 5 parameters. The line is also determined by the balance of articulation between hands. \n\nThe most prevalent type of ASL literature, however, is ASL storytelling. Storytelling transcends basic communication, incorporating techniques such as the \"visual vernacular\", as well as a feel for theatrical performance that Ben Bahan refers to as \"smooth signing\". Storytelling has served as a method of historical preservation, a mark of cultural identity, and most importantly, a common form of entertainment. Just as novelists perfect the art of storytelling through the medium of the written word, Deaf storytellers develop their own distinctive styles and techniques. In a culture that has not always been able to access the same forms of entertainment as hearing culture, such as movies or music, the Deaf have become fiercely proud of their storytellers. \n\nThe National Theatre of the Deaf originated in 1967 and performs both classic and original works in American Sign Language.\n\n\n\n"}

The books are rotated vertically similar to the motion of a water wheel, as opposed to rotating on a flat table surface. The design for the bookwheel originally appeared in a 16th-century illustration by Agostino Ramelli, at a time when large books posed practical problems for readers. Ramelli's design influenced other engineers and, though now obsolete, inspires modern artists and historians.\n\nThe bookwheel, in its most commonly seen form, was invented by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented as one of the 195 designs in \"Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli\" (\"The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli\"). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.\n\nTo what extent bookwheels were appreciated for their convenience versus their aesthetic qualities remains a matter of speculation according to modern American engineer Henry Petroski. Ramelli himself described the bookwheel as a \"beautiful and ingenious machine, very useful and convenient for anybody who takes pleasure in study, especially for those who are indisposed and tormented by gout.\" Ramelli's reference to gout, a condition that impairs mobility, demonstrates the appeal of a device that allows access to several books while seated. However, Petroski notes that Ramelli's illustration lacks space for writing and other scholarly work, and that the \"fanciful wheel\" may not have been appropriate for any activity beyond reading.\n\nWhile the design of the bookwheel is commonly credited to Ramelli, some historians dispute that he was the first to invent such a device. Joseph Needham, a historian of Chinese technology, stated that revolving bookcases, though not vertically oriented, had their origins in China \"perhaps a thousand years before Ramelli's design was taken there.\"\n\nThe bookwheel was an early attempt to solve the problem of managing increasingly numerous printed works, which were typically large and heavy in Ramelli's time. It has been called one of the earliest \"information retrieval\" devices, and has been considered a precursor to modern technologies, such as hypertext and e-readers, that allow readers to store and cross-reference large amounts of information. Other inventors, such as French inventor Nicolas Grollier de Servière (1596–1689), proposed their own variations on Ramelli's design.\n\nOf the dozens of bookwheels built in the 17th and 18th centuries, 14 are extant: in Ghent, Hamburg, Klosterneuburg, Krakau, Lambach, Leiden, Naples (2), Paris, Prague (2), Puebla City, Wernigerode and in Wolfenbüttel.\n\nIn contemporary times, the bookwheel is valued for its historical importance, decorative appeal, and symbolic significance. Ramelli's design has been recreated by artists such as Daniel Libeskind, and inspired the name of the Smithsonian Library's blog \"Turning the Book Wheel\".\n\n\n"}

The chief mate is customarily a watchstander and is in charge of the ship's cargo and deck crew. The actual title used will vary by ship's employment, by type of ship, by nationality, and by trade. Informally, the Chief Mate will often simply be called \"The Mate\". The term \"Chief Mate\" is not usually used in the Commonwealth, although Chief Officer and First Mate are.\n\nThe chief mate is responsible to the Captain for the safety and security of the ship. Responsibilities include the crew's welfare and training in areas such as safety, firefighting, search and rescue.\n\nThe Chief Mate, who is the second in command of the vessel, is often equated, in corporate terms, to a senior manager for the operations on board, as the Mate is in charge of a number of departmental functions. In modern cargo vessels, the Mate holds appointments like Head of Deck Department, Head of Cargo/ Stowage Operations, Head of Safety/ Fire Fighting, Head of On-Board Security (Ship Security Officer), Head of Environment and Quality, and so forth.\n\nAs cargo officer, a chief mate oversees the loading, stowage, securing and unloading of cargoes. Moreover, the chief mate is accountable for the care of cargo during the voyage. This includes a general responsibility for the ship's stability and special care for cargoes that are dangerous, hazardous or harmful.\n\nEven under the best of conditions, a ship is balanced precariously upon the water and is subject to a number of forces, such as wind, swells, and storms, which could capsize it. The cargo officer uses tools like ballasting and load balancing to optimize the ship's performance for the expected type of environment.\n\nTraditionally, the chief mate stands a \"4-8\" watch: from 4 AM until 8 AM and 4 PM until 8 PM., in port and at sea, the chief mate is responsible to the captain for keeping the ship, crew, and cargo safe. On watch, the mate must enforce all applicable regulations, such as the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and pollution regulations. In port, the watch focuses on duties such as cargo operations, fire and security watches, monitoring communications and the anchor or mooring lines.\n\nIMO regulations require the officer be fluent in English. This is required for a number of reasons, such as ability to use nautical charts and nautical publications, to understand weather and safety messages, communicate with other ships and coast stations, and to be able to work with a multi-lingual crew.\n\nAt sea, the mate on watch has three fundamental duties: navigate the ship, safely avoid traffic, and respond to any emergencies that may arise. Mates generally stand watch with able seamen who act as helmsman and lookout. The helmsman executes turns and the lookout reports dangers such as approaching ships. These roles are often combined to a single helmsman/lookout and, under some circumstances, are eliminated completely. The ability to smartly handle a ship is key to safe watchstanding. A ship's draught, trim, speed and under-keel clearance all affect its turning radius and stopping distance. Other factors include the effects of wind and current, squat, shallow water and similar effects. Shiphandling is key when the need arises to rescue a man overboard, to anchor, or to moor the ship.\n\nThe officer must also be able to transmit and receive signals by Morse light and to use the International Code of Signals.\n\nCelestial, terrestrial, electronic, and coastal navigation techniques are used to fix a ship's position on a navigational chart. The officer directs the helmsman to keep to track, accounting for effects of winds, tides, currents and estimated speed. The officer uses supplemental information from nautical publications, such as Sailing Directions, tide tables, Notices to Mariners, and radio navigational warnings to keep the ship clear of danger in transit.\n\nSafety demands the mate be able to quickly solve steering control problems and to calibrate the system for optimum performance. Since magnetic and gyrocompasses show the course to steer, the officer must be able to determine and correct for compass errors.\n\nWeather's profound effect on ships requires the officer be able to interpret and apply meteorological information from all available sources. This requires expertise in weather systems, reporting procedures and recording systems.\n\nThe International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea are a cornerstone of safe watchkeeping. Safety requires that one live these rules and follows the principles of safe watchkeeping. Maximizing bridge teamwork, including the practice of Bridge Resource Management, is an emerging focus in watchkeeping.\n\nThe main purpose for Radar and Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA) on a ship's bridge is to move safely among other vessels. These instruments help to accurately judge information about prominent objects in the vicinity, such as:\n\n\nThese factors help the officer apply the COLREGS to safely maneuver in the vicinity of obstructions and other ships.\n\nUnfortunately, radar has a number of limitations, and ARPA inherits those limitations and adds a number of its own. Factors such as rain, high seas, and dense clouds can prevent radar from detecting other vessels. Further, dense traffic and course and speed changes can confuse ARPA units. Finally, human errors such as inaccurate speed inputs and confusion between true and relative vectors add to the limitations of the radar/ARPA suite.\n\nUnder the best conditions, the radar operator must be able to optimize system settings and detect divergences between an ARPA system and actual conditions. Information obtained from radar and ARPA must be treated with scrutiny: over reliance on these systems has sunk ships. The officer must understand system performance, limitations and accuracy, tracking capabilities and limitations, and processing delays, and the use of operational warnings and system tests.\n\nEmergencies can happen at any time. The officer must be equipped to safeguard passengers and crew. The officer must be able to take initial action after a collision or a grounding. Responsibilities include performing damage assessment and control, understanding the procedures for rescuing persons from the sea, assisting ships in distress, and responding to any emergency which may arise in port.\n\nThe Chief Mate is in charge of the firefighting and damage control teams. He is scene leader and reports via radio to the Captain who is in command and coordinates the larger response from the bridge.\n\nThe officer must understand distress signals and know the IMO Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual.\n\nUnderstanding ship's stability, trim, stress, and the basics of ship's construction is a key to keeping a ship seaworthy. The mate must know what to do in cases of flooding and loss of buoyancy. Fire is also a constant concern. Knowing the classes and chemistry of fire, fire-fighting appliances, and systems prepares the officer to act fast in case of fire.\n\nAn officer must be expert in the use of survival craft and rescue boats. Expertise includes the vessels' launching appliances and arrangements, and their equipment including radio life-saving appliances, satellite EPIRBs, SARTs, immersion suits and thermal protective aids. It's important to be expert in the techniques for survival at sea techniques in case it's necessary to abandon ship.\n\nOfficers are trained to perform medical tasks, and follow instructions given by radio or obtained from guides. This training includes what to do in case of common shipboard accidents and illnesses.\n\nOn very large or international passenger ships it is usual for a chief/first officer to hold a master's certificate so that he can take over from the master if necessary. In the same way, a second officer may hold a chief officer's certificate.\n\nTo become a chief mate (unlimited) in the United States, one must first accumulate at least 365 days of service while holding a second mate's license. Then, the candidate must attend approximately 13 weeks of classes or complete the assessments from NMC Policy Letter 04-02 and pass a series of examinations given by the United States Coast Guard. Similarly, one must have worked as a third mate for 365 days to have become a second mate. There are many special cases in license upgrades at the individual level, as licensing regulations change from time to time. A sizable portion of mates still working received their licenses before current laws went into effect.\n\nThere are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate \"sea time\" and take a series of training classes and examinations.\n\nTraining institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (deck curriculum), the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and U.S. Naval Academy with qualification as an underway officer in charge of a navigational watch, any of the state maritime colleges, the Great Lakes Maritime Academy, or a three-year apprentice mate training program approved by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nA seaman may start the process of attaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as able seaman, boatswain, or quartermaster. Then the seaman takes required training courses, and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a Third Mate's license.\n\nA master of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license.\n\nIf approved the applicant must then successfully pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license. \"Hawsepiper\" is an informal maritime industry term used to refer to an officer who began his or her career as an unlicensed merchant seaman and did not attend a traditional maritime college/academy to earn the officer license.\n\nA ship’s hawsepipe is the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the anchor chain passes through. Hawsepiper refers to climbing up the hawsepipe, a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. Hawsepiper is considered a positive term when said respectfully. Many hawsepipers are proud of their background and use the term to describe themselves.\n\nSeveral merchant seamen's unions offer their membership the required training to for career advancement. Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training.\n\nSince the requirements of STCW '95 have been enacted, there have been complaints that the hawsepiper progression path has been made too difficult because of the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements. These critics assert that the newer requirements will eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The concept of a cone is a more abstract notion that subsumes all of these families. A similar notion is the faithful cone, having somewhat relaxed conditions. For example, the context-sensitive languages do not form a cone, but still have the required properties to form a faithful cone.\n\nThe terminology \"cone\" has a French origin. In the American oriented literature one usually speaks of a \"full trio\". The \"trio\" corresponds to the faithful cone.\n\nA cone is a family formula_1 of languages such that formula_1 contains at least one non-empty language, and for any formula_3 over some alphabet formula_4,\n\nThe family of all regular languages is contained in any cone.\n\nIf one restricts the definition to homomorphisms that do not introduce the empty word formula_19 then one speaks of a \"faithful cone\"; the inverse homomorphisms are not restricted. Within the Chomsky hierarchy, the regular languages, the context-free languages, and the recursively enumerable languages are all cones, whereas the context-sensitive languages and the recursive languages are only faithful cones.\n\nA finite state transducer is a finite state automaton that has both input and output. It defines a transduction formula_20, mapping a language formula_21 over the input alphabet into another language formula_22 over the output alphabet. Each of the cone operations (homomorphism, inverse homomorphism, intersection with a regular language) can be implemented using a finite state transducer. And, since finite state transducers are closed under composition, every sequence of cone operations can be performed by a finite state transducer.\n\nConversely, every finite state transduction formula_20 can be decomposed into cone operations. In fact, there exists a normal form for this decomposition, which is commonly known as \"Nivat's Theorem\":\nNamely, each such formula_20 can be effectively decomposed as\nformula_25, where formula_26 are homomorphisms, and formula_15 is a regular language depending only on formula_20.\n\nAltogether, this means that a family of languages is a cone if it is closed under finite state transductions. This is a very powerful set of operations. For instance one easily writes a (nondeterministic) finite state transducer with alphabet formula_29 that removes every second formula_30 in words of even length (and does not change words otherwise). Since the context-free languages form a cone, they are closed under this exotic operation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4013613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4013613", "title": "Coordinative definition", "text": "Coordinative definition\n\nA coordinative definition is a postulate which assigns a partial meaning to the theoretical terms of a scientific theory by correlating the mathematical objects of the \"pure\" or formal/syntactical aspects of a theory with physical objects in the world. The idea was formulated by the logical positivists and arises out of a formalist vision of mathematics as pure symbol manipulation. \n\nIn order to get a grasp on the motivations which inspired the development of the idea of coordinative definitions, it is important to understand the doctrine of formalism as it is conceived in the philosophy of mathematics. For the formalists, mathematics, and particularly geometry, is divided into two parts: the \"pure\" and the \"applied\". The first part consists in an uninterpreted axiomatic system, or syntactic calculus, in which terms such as \"point\", \"straight line\" and \"between\" (the so-called primitive terms) have their meanings assigned to them implicitly by the axioms in which they appear. On the basis of deductive rules eternally specified in advance, pure geometry provides a set of theorems derived in a purely logical manner from the axioms. This part of mathematics is therefore \"a priori\" but devoid of any empirical meaning, not synthetic in the sense of Kant.\n\nIt is only by connecting these primitive terms and theorems with physical objects such as rulers or rays of light that, according to the formalist, pure mathematics becomes applied mathematics and assumes an empirical meaning. The method of correlating the abstract mathematical objects of the pure part of theories with physical objects consists in coordinative definitions. \n\nIt was characteristic of logical positivism to consider a scientific theory to be nothing more than a set of sentences, subdivided into the class of theoretical sentences, the class of observational sentences, and the class of mixed sentences. The first class contains terms which refer to theoretical entities, that is to entities not directly observable such as electrons, atoms and molecules; the second class contains terms which denote quantities or observable entities, and the third class consists of precisely the coordinative definitions which contain both types of terms because they connect the theoretical terms with empirical procedures of measurement or with observable entities. For example, the interpretation of \"the geodesic between two points\" as correspondent to \"the path of a light ray in a vacuum\" provides a coordinative definition. This is very similar to, but distinct from an operational definition. The difference is that coordinative definitions do not \"necessarily\" define theoretical terms in terms of laboratory procedures or experimentation, as operationalism does, but may also define them in terms of observable or empirical \"entities\".\n\nIn any case, such definitions (also called \"bridge laws\" or \"correspondence rules\") were held to serve three important purposes. In the first place, by connecting the uninterpreted formalism with the observation language, they permit the assignment of synthetic content to theories. In the second, according to whether they express a factual or a purely conventional content, they allow for the subdivision of science into two parts: one factual and independent of human conventions, the other non-empirical and conventional. This distinction is reminiscent of Kant's division of knowledge into content and form. Lastly, they allow for the possibility to avoid certain vicious circles that arise with regard to such matters as the measurement of the speed of light in one direction. As has been pointed out by John Norton with regard to Hans Reichenbach's arguments about the nature of geometry: on the one hand, we cannot know if there are universal forces until we know the true geometry of spacetime, but on the other, we cannot know the true geometry of spacetime until we know whether there are universal forces. Such a circle can be broken by way of coordinative definition.(Norton 1992).\n\nFrom the point of view of the logical empiricist, in fact, the question of the \"true geometry\" of spacetime does not arise, given that saving, e.g., Euclidean geometry by introducing universal forces which cause rulers to contract in certain directions, or postulating that such forces are equal to zero, does not mean saving the Euclidean geometry of \"actual\" space, but only changing the definitions of the corresponding terms. There are not really two incompatible theories to choose between, in the case of the true geometry of spacetime, for the empiricist (Euclidean geometry with universal forces not equal to zero, or non-Euclidean geometry with universal forces equal to zero), but only one theory formulated in two different ways, with different meanings to attribute to the fundamental terms on the basis of coordinative definitions. However, given that, according to formalism, interpreted or applied geometry \"does\" have empirical content, the problem is not resolved on the basis of purely conventionalist considerations and it is precisely the coordinative definitions, which bear the burden of finding the correspondences between mathematical and physical objects, which provide the basis for an empirical choice.\n\nThe problem is that coordinative definitions seem to beg the question. Since they are defined in conventional, non-empirical terms, it is difficult to see how they can resolve empirical questions. It would seem that the result of using coordinative definitions is simply to shift the problem of the geometric description of the world, for example, into a need to explain the mysterious \"isomorphic coincidences\" between the conventions given by the definitions and the structure of the physical world.\nEven in the simple case of defining \"the geodesic between two points\" as the empirical phrase \"a ray of light in a vacuum\", the correspondence between mathematical and empirical is left unexplained.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10044662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10044662", "title": "Forkner shorthand", "text": "Forkner shorthand\n\nForkner Shorthand is an alphabetic shorthand created by Hamden L. Forkner and first published in 1955. Its popularity grew through the 1980s as those who needed shorthand every day (such as secretaries) began to favor the easier learning curve of alphabetic systems to the more difficult (but potentially faster) symbol-based ones. Forkner was taught in high-schools and colleges throughout North America along with comparable shorthands such as AlphaHand, Speedwriting, Stenoscript and Personal Shorthand.\n\nForkner is written with a handful of special symbols mixed with simplified versions of cursive longhand letters. A long horizontal stroke replaces \"m\" and a curved line stands for \"ing.\" The letters used are almost exclusively lower-case, written from left to right and joined in a standard cursive hand. Capital letters are used for special purposes; a detached \"T\" stands for the prefix \"trans-\" and the upper-case \"S\" represents \"s\" followed by \"t.\"\n\nThe way Forkner represents vowels may be unique among alphabetic systems. Instead of using only ordinary cursive forms, the vowels a/o/u and short i are reduced to dots and apostrophe-like strokes and ticks, mostly written after the body of word has been made. These vowel marks can be omitted if the writer feels they are unnecessary since many words are legible without their vowels.\n\nOrdinary cursive vowels are reserved for long e, for diphthongs (e.g., \"o\" for \"ow/ou\"), or as affixes (e.g. \"u\" for \"under-\"). The \"long i\" diphthong is written as a dotless cursive i, for example, \"fine\" becomes \"fın.\"\n\nWhile consonants are written phonetically, vowels generally reflect their original spelling. Forkner's symbol for \"a\" might express any of the sounds represented by \"a\" in English words such as \"cat, father, ago, day.\" The \"oo\" sounds in \"too\" and \"book\" are represented by the \"u\" symbol. The short \"e\" sound is simply omitted: \"less\" becomes \"ls.\"\n\nForkner makes use of several standard shorthand features to gain additional speed: brief forms, common abbreviations, and phrasing. Brief forms are essentially shortened versions of frequent words or words potentially encountered in business letters. They are not always immediately transparent to the untrained reader, such as \"Db\" for \"distribute\". The more commonly known abbreviations, like those for the days of the week, are also used in Forkner.\n\nThe shorter brief forms (one or two letters) that follow each other in a sentence are joined together as though they were one word; this is known as phrasing. Those familiar with Gregg or Pitman Shorthand will recognize this feature: operating on the philosophy that the time taken to repeatedly lift the pen between short words is wasted, the words in a group such as \"will you be able\" are compacted into one word. Though it may sound confusing, it is always clear to the transcriber what is meant, both through context and the words most commonly found in phrases, such as \"all\" (\"l\"), \"of\" (\"v\"), \"the\" (–), \"please\" (\"p\"), \"be\" (\"b\"), etc.\n\nPunctuation is fairly similar to the ordinary longhand equivalents. A period is a dot and a question mark is simply \"?\" without the dot. New paragraphs are indicated with double diagonal strokes \"//\". Capitalized words, such as names, are indicated by a small check-mark placed under the word.\n\nStudents can begin adding Forkner shortcuts to their longhand writing as soon as they begin studying the system. One experienced shorthand instructor observed, \"Students get instant satisfaction because they can apply it from the beginning.\" This reportedly resulted in fewer students giving up on Forkner compared to other shorthand systems. One teacher told a reporter, \"The highest dropout rate in the Vancouver school system is in traditional shorthand courses, yet I have never had a dropout in Forkner.\"\n\nReports from shorthand instructors indicated results such as the following: an average student can achieve 50 words per minute after a 30-hour course; most of the students who took a 9-month course in high school reached or surpassed a goal of 60 wpm; in an experimental class taught at Chester High School (Pennsylvania), some students were able to write 100 words per minute after three months of intensive training.\n\nForkner shorthand's relative ease of learning was investigated in several academic dissertations and theses.\n\nDr. Forkner was a professor of business education at Columbia University when he began designing and testing his shorthand system. In 1955 he established the Forkner Publishing Company and issued its first book, \"Forkner alphabet shorthand: A scientific high-speed system of writing: the only system of shorthand that combines the best features of symbol systems with easily written longhand letters.\" He promoted his system at teachers' conferences and helped organize some adult education classes.\n\nIn 1963 an experimental class at a Vancouver high school was successful and the school district implemented the course in 10 additional schools in September 1964. Larry Oszust, the instructor of the trial class, told a newspaper that his students had made as much progress in one year of Forkner classes as they would have made in two years of Gregg or Pitman training. From that starting point, Forkner gradually spread through high schools and universities in Canada and the US, competing with other shorthand systems.\n\nIn the 1980s public interest in handwritten shorthand evaporated. Fewer and fewer schools in North America offered shorthand classes. The publication of Forkner-related books concluded in 1991 when Nelson Canada printed the final run of the \"Forkner Shorthand Dictionary.\" Manuals and dictionaries are still readily available on auction and second-hand book sites.\n\n"}

Originally, home movies were made on photographic film in formats that usually limited the movie-maker to about three minutes per roll of costly camera film. The vast majority of amateur film formats lacked audio, shooting silent film. \n\nThe 1970s saw the advent of consumer camcorders that could record an hour or two of video on one relatively inexpensive videocassette which also had audio. This was followed by digital video cameras that recorded to flash memory, and most recently smartphones with video recording capability, made the creation of home movies easier and much more affordable to the average person.\n\nThe technological boundaries between home-movie-making and professional movie-making are becoming increasingly blurred as prosumer equipment often offers features previously only available on professional equipment.\n\nIn recent years, clips from home movies have been available to wider audiences through television series such as \"America's Funniest Home Videos\", in Great Britain \"You've Been Framed!\" and Internet online video-sharing sites such as YouTube. The popularity of the Internet, and wider availability of high-speed connections has provided new ways of sharing home movies, such as video weblogs (vlogs), and video podcasts.\n\nThe development of home movie-making has depended critically on the availability of equipment and media formats (film stock, video tape, etc.) at prices affordable to consumers. The introduction of film formats suitable for amateur hobbyists began early in the history of cinematography.\n\nThe 17.5 mm \"Birtac\" format was patented by Birt Acres in 1898. This format split the standard 35 mm film into two strips half as wide and could be loaded into the camera in daylight. Since the film frames were also half the height of 35 mm frames, the Birtac format used only 25% of the amount of film stock used by 35 mm. The camera doubled as a printer and projector, so equipment costs were also reduced.\n\nIn 1922, the French firm Pathé Frères introduced a new film format 9.5 mm wide which put the sprocket holes between the frames instead of along the sides of the film, allowing the images to occupy nearly the entire width. The resulting frames were nearly as large and clear as with the slightly later 16 mm format, which devoted much of its width to the stabilizing perforations. Used both for making home movies and for showing shortened \"cinema-at-home\" versions of professionally made feature films, it enjoyed popularity for several decades in Europe, including the UK, but was virtually unknown in the US.\n\nOf importance in making motion picture film practical for home use was the manufacturing option of safety film in the 1920s. The nitrate film used by professionals required caution in handling and projection because it is highly flammable. Old nitrate film in poor condition has even been known to spontaneously catch fire if stored improperly.\n\nThe 16 mm format, which used only safety film, was introduced by Eastman Kodak in 1923 and became a standard in the non-professional market. Although 16 mm had the advantage that users were not tied to one equipment manufacturer, and there were obvious cost advantages compared to standard 35 mm, the advent of an even smaller and cheaper format ultimately relegated 16 mm to professional users, particularly in the educational market.\n\nIn 1932, Kodak introduced another new format, 8 mm, now called \"Standard 8\" or \"Regular 8\", which put four frames into the area occupied by one standard 16 mm frame. The film usually came in 16 mm wide \"Double 8\" form, which ran through the camera in two passes (one in each direction) and was slit in half after processing. The \"Straight 8\" variant came already cut to 8 mm width. In either case, the amount of film stock used per frame was again reduced by 75%. This finally brought home movies within the reach of the average family. The smaller format also made possible smaller and more portable cameras and projectors.\n\nThe introduction of Kodachrome color reversal film for 16 mm in 1935, and for 8 mm in 1936, facilitated home color cinematography. The availability of reversal film, both black-and-white and Kodachrome, was very important to the economics of home movie-making because it avoided the expense of separate negatives and positive prints.\n\nThe original 8 mm format was largely superseded within a few years of Kodak's 1965 introduction of Super 8 film. The Super 8 format used the same film width as standard 8 mm, but the perforations were smaller, making room for larger frames that yielded a clearer image. In addition, Super 8 film came in cartridges for easier loading into the camera. High-end Super 8 also could be purchased with a magnetic audio track, allowing for synchronized sound home movies. Single-8, a competing product from Fujifilm, was also introduced in 1965. It used the same new format as Super 8 but on a thinner polyester base and in a different type of camera cartridge.\n\nThe introduction of the Beta VCR in 1975 and VHS in 1976 heralded a revolution in the making of home movies. Videocassettes were extremely inexpensive compared to film and they could even be erased. This had the effect of greatly increasing the hours of footage of most family video libraries. It took a few years before consumer video cameras and portable VCRs were introduced, and later combined to create camcorders, but by that time, many consumers already had the playback equipment in their homes.\n\nPortability and small size of digital home movie equipment, such as camera phones and PDAs with video capabilities, has led to the banning of such devices from various places, due to privacy and security concerns.\n\nPornographic movies of celebrities have been rumoured to exist for many years, but the ease of creating home movies on video has resulted in several celebrity sex tapes becoming available to the public, often without the permission of participants. The honeymoon video of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee from 1998 was the first highly publicized example.\n\nPortability of digital equipment helps fuel other controversies as well, such as the incident on November 17, 2006 in which comedian Michael Richards got into a racist war of words with an audience member during his comedy club act. Large parts of the incident were captured on the camera phone of another audience member and broadcast widely.\n\nHome movies have played important roles in controversial criminal investigations. The prime example is the Zapruder film of the 1963 assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, accidentally captured on Kodachrome film with an 8 mm home movie camera. The film became crucial evidence for the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination. At first, only black-and-white enlargements of individual film frames were published, and the most gruesome frame was withheld. The public did not actually see the images in motion for many years. The first showing on network television occurred in 1975.\n\n\n"}

The teacher uses the interactive writing session to model reading and writing strategies as he or she engages children in creating text.\n\nInteractive writing was also included by Fountas & Pinnell as part of their balanced literacy framework. Similar to shared writing, interactive writing allows a teacher and students to literally \"share the pen\" to create a joint sentence or message. Typically used in the primary grades, interactive writing is a powerful instructional medium for teaching phonics, spelling principles, rimes, writing conventions, and other key early writing skills. This form of interactive writing is thoroughly explained and detailed in the book \"Interactive Writing: How Language & Literacy Come Together, K-2\" by Andrea McCarrier, Gay Su Pinnell, and Irene Fountas. \n\nOthers have described interactive writing differently as a method used in literacy teaching, especially for young children, whereby the students have the opportunity to practice their reading, studying and writing skills in a safe and creative environment. \n\nIn this method the teacher(s) and students write to each other, by means of letters, dialogue journals or a message board. The students are free to choose the topic and the length of their writings. The teachers respond without correcting or criticising the spelling, grammar or writing style, but rather modelling more appropriate forms of writing.\n\nThe aim of this method is to allow children to see literacy as something meaningful and enjoyable, rather than a mind-numbing school activity. The focus is on fluency rather than accuracy. The principle behind it is 'write to learn, not learn to write'. As such it relates to the learner-centered whole language approach.\n\nThe interactive writing method has been described in books such as:\n\nPeyton, Joy Kreeft (ed.)

On June 5, 1710, he was admitted to the Holy Orders by the Bishop of London, Henry Compton and appointed to the Mission at Dover then part of the Province of Pennsylvania and known as \"Dover Hundred\".\n\nIn 1711, he traveled to New York and was apparently disturbed by what he observed in the churches there. In June 1712, he returned to England and described the state of the Church of England in New York and New Jersey as unacceptable, and implicating Governor Robert Hunter. While Hunter wrote a written rebuttal to this assessment, it served to raise Henderson's stature.\n\nIn December 1712, Henderson returned to the new world after being appointed to a Mission at \"Patuxent Hundreds\" (without a parish).\n\nJacob Henrderson's first wife Mary (surname unknown) was the third and final wife of Mareen Duvall who died in 1694 and she administered his substantial estate. Duvall had purchased sizeable tracts of land, including \"Catton,\" later known as Belair as well as owning Middle Plantation in Davidsonville, Maryland.\n\nIn 1696, she married Henry Ridgely. In 1700, Ridgely purchased an additional adjacent to \"Catton\" called \"Enfield Chase\" Upon Ridgely's death in 1710, his third wife, now twice widowed, was executrix of the will and received those properties. Mary had previously inherited Middle Plantation in Davidsonville, Maryland when her first husband, Mareen Duvall died in 1694.\n\nMary married Henderson in 1713, quickly establishing the man as a wealthy landowner.\n\nIn 1713, St. Anne's Parish in Annapolis, Maryland had become vacant and Henderson was asked to serve there as well, despite living about away. He served there for a year.\n\nThat same year, he and his wife built a small chapel near their residence at Belair, which was known as Henderson's Chapel or Forest Chapel.\n</ref>\n\nIt is not clear if Rev. Johnathan White died in 1717 or was removed from the position as Rector of Queen Anne Parish. On December 17, 1717, Reverend Jacob Henderson was appointed as rector of Queen Anne Parish.\n\nIn 1723, the Bishop of London, Dr. John Robinson died, and his successor, Dr. Edmund Gibson chose not to renew Henderson's appointment to the Mission. Henderson then focused exclusively on the Parish.\n\nIn 1729, Henderson traveled to England for 18 months to discuss the difficulties he found in the Colonies. When he returned, he had been appointed to the overall Mission of the Colony. The clergy welcomed his return, but the Laity were bitterly opposed.\n\nHe then convened the Conventions of the Clergy on both the western and eastern shores of the Province. Over the next several years, he focused on the issue of discipline and profligacy among the clergy. This met with a great deal of resistance and by 1734, he resigned his appointment, being the last representative of the Bishop in the Colony.\n\nOn 19 January 1735/6, Henderson's wife Mary was buried, her death date being unknown. She was buried in Henderson's Chapel. In 1737, Henderson gave the chapel and of land for the use of Queen Anne's Parish called \"the Glebe whereon there is a Chapple now standing.\" Almost 100 years later, in 1836 Henderson's Chapel became an independent congregation, Holy Trinity Episcopal Church.\n\nAfter the death of his first wife Mary, Jacob Henderson secondly married Mary (Stanton) on 2 November 1740. who at the time was the widow of Robert Tyler. She was the widow successively of a Mr. Dodd and of Robert Tyler, whom she had married on 12 June 1718 as Mary [the widow] Dodd.\n\nBy this time, Henderson had become good friends with Provincial Governor Samuel Ogle. On March 30, 1737 for the sum of £500, Henderson sold three parcels of land to Ogle for him to build his Governor's estate.\n\nOn July 6, 1737, Ogle granted Henderson leave of absence from the Province for 18 months to return to England. During this leave, Henderson was elected to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and returned to Maryland in May 1739. Nine years later, in August 1748, Ogle granted Henderson another leave of 18 months for England. Henderson returned for the final time in April 1750.\n\nHenderson died on August 27, 1751 after 34 years of service at St. Barnabas and Queen Anne. After specific bequests to family members and friends, he bequeathed the residue to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The inventory of his estate was valued at 1423 pounds, 8 shillings, 8 pence. An additional inventory added another 41 pounds, 10 shillings, 9 pence. The distribution to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was made in two payments. One was for 62 pounds, 17 shillings, 5 pence. The second was for 43 pounds, 4 shillings, and 10 pence. His will had been written on 4 August 1751 and probated on 26 October 1751. His wife Mary (née Stanton) wrote her will on 2 October 1761 and was probated on 18 February 1762 in Prince George's County, Maryland. In her will she styled herself as \"widow of The Rivirend Mr. Jacob Henderson, late of Prince George's Co. decd.\" Among her bequests were ones to her \"son-in-law\" [step-son] Robert Tyler and to Daniel Stanton, son of my brother Daniel Stanton (my sd. nephew lately living in Philadelphia).\n\n"}

Later on, after moving to Chirawa he studied till matriculation.\n\nHe learned his business from his elder brother and played a major role in establishing Dalmia Industries and later founded Dalmia Cements in 1935, which is now run by his sons and grandsons.\n\nIn the year 1932–33 Ramkrishna along with a businessman from Bihar Nirmalkumar Jain started a sugar mill, Jaidayal was appointed to look after the mill, with his keen interest and dedication he got the mill commissioned within short span of 1 year. Within a year one more sugar mill, Rohtas Industries Ltd was started near Dehri-on-sone at Dalmianagar. Jaidayal supported his elder brother in all his ventures and showed immense interest in the business. Later on, Dehri-on-sone was named .\n\nIn few years Ramkrishna and Jaidayal established six cement factories in, Dandot, Dalmiapuram, Rajgangpur, Jind and one more factory at Shantinagar, Karachi. Jaidayal played a major role in getting the machinery from Europe. He imported improved technology, which not only make his competitor's technology obsolete, he also forced Danish to reduce their price of exporting Wet Process Technology in India.\n\nWith wide interest in machinery, Jaidayal Dalmia played major role in technical functions of all the factories in Dalmianagar and other plants as well. Soon after establishing the Rajgangpur factory called Orissa Cements. Jaidayal later started fire bricks refractory in Rourkela in the year 1954.\n\nRamkrishna Dalmia ventured in banking sector and started Bharat Bank with branches at many places in India. He also entered in Aviation business and acquired interests in Bharat Insurance Company and controlling interests in Punjab National Bank. In the automotive sphere, one company of the Group, Allen Berry & Co. Limited, purchased the entire lot of American surplus disposal vehicles, numbering about 50,000, after World War II. This company ran vast workshops in various parts of India till the 1950s when it was disbanded. Knowing that media played an extremely major part in the development of the nation, he acquired Times of India and started news paper in Hindi & Bengali as well. He purchased Govan Bros. and ventured in Chemicals too. At the time, the Dalmia companies together ranked third among India's major industrial groups after the Tatas and the Birlas.\n\nShortly after the independence, the Dalmia empire was divided among Ramkrishna Dalmia, Jaidayal Dalmia and Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain, son-in-law of Ramkrishna. Dalmianagar and publishing co. Bennett, Coleman & Co.

{"id": "53483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53483", "title": "Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien", "text": "Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien\n\nThe philologist and author J. R. R. Tolkien created a number of constructed languages, including languages devised for fictional settings. Inventing languages (called \"glossopoeia\" by Tolkien, from Greek γλώσσα glôssa, \"language, tongue\" and ποιῶ poiô, \"to make\" paralleling his idea of \"mythopoeia\" or myth-making) was a lifelong occupation for Tolkien, starting in his teens.\nAn early project of Tolkien was the reconstruction of an unrecorded early Germanic language which might have been spoken by the people of \"Beowulf\" in the Germanic heroic age.\n\nThe most-developed project of Tolkien was his Elvish languages. He first started \nconstructing an \"Elvin tongue\" in while he was at the King Edward's School, Birmingham. He later called it Quenya (), and he continued actively developing the history and grammar of his Elvish languages until his death in 1973.\n\nIn 1931, he held a lecture about his passion for constructed languages, titled \"A Secret Vice\". Here he contrasts his project of artistic languages constructed for aesthetic pleasure with the pragmatism of international auxiliary languages. The lecture also discusses Tolkien's views on phonaesthetics, citing Greek, Finnish, and Welsh as examples of \"languages which have a very characteristic and in their different ways beautiful word-form\".\n\nTolkien's glossopoeia has two temporal dimensions: the internal (fictional) timeline of events described in \"The Silmarillion\" and other writings, and the external timeline of Tolkien's own life during which he often revised and refined his languages and their fictional history.\n\nTolkien was a professional philologist of ancient Germanic languages, specialising in Old English. He was also interested in many languages outside his field, and developed a particular love for the Finnish language. He described the finding of a Finnish grammar book as \"like discovering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before\".\n\nGlossopoeia was Tolkien's hobby for most of his life. At a little over 13, he helped construct a sound substitution cypher known as Nevbosh, 'new nonsense', which grew to include some elements of actual invented language. Notably, Tolkien claimed that this was not his first effort in invented languages. Shortly thereafter, he developed a true invented language called Naffarin which contained elements that would survive into his later languages, which he continued to work on until his death more than 65 years later. Language invention had always been tightly connected to the mythology that Tolkien developed, as he found that a language could not be complete without the history of the people who spoke it, just as these people could never be fully realistic if imagined only through English and as speaking English. Tolkien therefore took the stance of a translator and adaptor rather than that of the original author of his works.\n\nTolkien was of the opinion that the invention of an artistic language in order to be convincing and pleasing must include not only the language's historical development, but also the history of its speakers, and especially the mythology associated with both the language and the speakers. It was this idea that an \"Elvish language\" must be associated with a complex history and mythology of the Elves that was at the core of the development of Tolkien's legendarium.\n\nTolkien wrote in one of his letters: \"what I think is a primary 'fact' about my work, that it is all of a piece, and fundamentally linguistic in inspiration. ... It is not a 'hobby', in the sense of something quite different from one's work, taken up as a relief-outlet. The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in ‘Elvish’. But, of course, such a work as \"The Lord of the Rings\" has been edited and only as much 'language' has been left in as I thought would be stomached by readers. (I now find that many would have liked more.) ... It is to me, anyway, largely an essay in 'linguistic aesthetic', as I sometimes say to people who ask me 'what is it all about'.\"\n\nWhile the Elvish languages remained at the center of Tolkien's attention, the requirements of the narratives associated with Middle-earth also necessitated the development at least superficially of the languages of other races, especially of Dwarves and Men, but also the Black Speech designed by Sauron, the main antagonist in \"The Lord of the Rings\". This latter language was designed to be the ostensible antithesis of the ideal of an artistic language pursued with the development of Quenya, the Black Speech representing a dystopian parody of an international auxiliary language just as Sauron's rule over the Orcs is a dystopian parody of a totalitarian state.\n\nThe Elvish language family is a group of languages related by descent from a common ancestor, called the proto-language. Tolkien constructed the family from around 1910, working on it up to his death in 1973. He constructed the grammar and vocabulary of at least fifteen languages and dialects in roughly periods:\n\nAlthough the Elvish languages Sindarin and Quenya are the most famous and the most developed of the languages that Tolkien invented for his Secondary World, they are by no means the only ones. They belong to a family of Elvish languages, that originate in Common Eldarin, the language common to all Eldar, which in turn originates in Primitive Quendian, the common root of Eldarin and Avarin languages.\n\nFinnish morphology (particularly its rich system of inflection) in part gave rise to Quenya. Another of Tolkien's favourites was Welsh, and features of Welsh phonology found their way into Sindarin. Very few words were borrowed from existing languages, so that attempts to match a source to a particular Elvish word or name in works published during his lifetime are often very dubious.\n\nTolkien had worked out much of the etymological background of his Elvish languages during the 1930s (collected in the form of \"The Etymologies\"). \nIn 1937, he wrote the \"Lhammas\", a linguistic treatise addressing the relationship of not just the Elvish languages, but of all languages spoken in Middle-earth during the First Age. \nThe text purports to be a translation of an Elvish work, written by one Pengolodh, whose historical works are presented as being the main source of the narratives in \"The Silmarillion\" concerning the First Age.\n\nThe \"Lhammas\" exists in two versions, the shorter one being called the \"Lammasathen\". The main linguistic thesis in this text is that the languages of Middle-earth are all descended from the language of the Valar (the \"gods\"), Valarin, and divided into three branches:\n\nTolkien later revised this internal history to the effect that the Elves\nhad been capable of inventing language on their own, before coming into contact with Valarin (see Primitive Quendian).\n\nWhen working on \"The Lord of the Rings\" during the 1940s, Tolkien invested great effort into detailing the linguistics of Middle-earth.\n\nAs \"The Lord of the Rings\" was intended to represent as a sequel to \"The Hobbit\", which had not originally been intended to form part of the legendarium and used Old Norse names for the Dwarves, Tolkien came up with a literary device of real languages \"translating\" fictional languages. \nThis meant that a considerable number of additional constructed languages were envisaged, but none of them became as well developed as the family of Elvish languages.\nIn the \"Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien adopted the literary device of claiming to have translated the original Sôval Phârë speech (or Westron as he called it) into English. This device of rendering an \"imaginary\" language with a \"real\" one was carried further:\nthus mapping the genetic relation of his fictional languages on the existing historical relations of the Germanic languages. Furthermore, to parallel the Celtic substratum in England, he used Old Welsh names to render the Dunlendish names of Buckland Hobbits (e.g., Meriadoc for Kalimac).\n\nIn addition to that, there is a separate language family that is spoken by Men, the most prominent member of which was Westron (derived from the Númenórean speech Adûnaic), the \"Common speech\" of the peoples of \"The Lord of the Rings\". Most Mannish tongues showed influences by Elvish, as well as some Dwarvish influences. Several independent languages were drafted as well, an example being Khuzdul, the language of the Dwarves. Other languages are Valarin (the tongue of the Valar), and the Black Speech created by Sauron in the Second Age.\n\nBecause of the device Modern English representing Westron, there was no necessity to actually work out the details of Westron grammar or vocabulary in any detail, but Tolkien does give some examples of Westron words in Appendix F to \"The Lord of the Rings\", where he also summarizes its origin and role as \"lingua franca\" in Middle-earth:\n\nOther \"Mannish\" languages envisaged for the setting of \"The Lord of the Rings\", but barely developed in terms of grammar or vocabulary, include Haladin, Dunlendish, Drûg, Haradrim, and Easterling.\n\nSome samples of the language of the Dwarves, called Khuzdul, are also found in \"The Lord of the Rings\". The situation here is a little different from the \"Mannish\" languages: As \"Khuzdul\" was kept secret by the Dwarves and never used in the presence of outsiders (not even Dwarvish given names), it was not \"translated\" by any real-life historical language, and such limited examples as there are in the text are given in the \"original\". \nKhuzdul was designed to have a \"Semitic\" affinity, with a system of triconsonantal roots and other parallels especially to Hebrew, just as some aspects of the Dwarves and the Jews are intentional.\n\nTolkien devised Adûnaic (or Númenórean), the language spoken in Númenor, shortly after World War II, and thus at about the time he completed \"The Lord of the Rings\", but before he wrote the linguistic \nbackground information of the Appendices.\nAdûnaic is intended as the language from which Westron (also called \"Adûni\") is derived.\nThis added a depth of historical development to the Mannish languages.\nAdûnaic was intended to have a \"faintly Semitic flavour\".\nIts development began with \"The Notion Club Papers\" (written in 1945). It is there that the most extensive sample of the language is found, revealed to one of the (modern-day) protagonists, Lowdham, of that story in a visionary dream of Atlantis. Its grammar is sketched in the unfinished \"Lowdham's Report on the Adunaic Language\".\nTolkien remained undecided whether the language of the Men of Númenor should be derived from the original Mannish language (as in Adûnaic), or if it should be derived from \"the Elvish Noldorin\" (i.e. Quenya) instead.\nIn \"The Lost Road and Other Writings\" it is implied that \nthe Númenóreans spoke Quenya, and that Sauron, hating all things Elvish, taught the Númenóreans the old Mannish tongue they themselves had forgotten.\n\nBeing a skilled penman, Tolkien not only invented many languages but also scripts. Some of his scripts were designed for use with his constructed languages, others for more practical ends: to be used in his personal diary, and one especially for English, the \"New English Alphabet\".\n\nThe following is a list of scripts in chronological order:\n\nThe first published monograph dedicated to the Elvish languages was \"An Introduction to Elvish\" (1978) edited by Jim Allan (published by Bran's Head Books). It is composed of articles written before the publication of \"The Silmarillion\".\n\nWith the publication of much linguistic material during the 1990s, especially in the \"History of Middle-earth\" series, \nand the \"Vinyar Tengwar\" and \"Parma Eldalamberon\" material published at an increasing rate during the early 2000s from the stock of linguistic material in the possession of the appointed team of editors (some 3000 pages according to them),\nthe subject of Tolkien's constructed languages has become much more accessible.\n\nDavid Salo wrote \"A Gateway to Sindarin: A Grammar of an Elvish Language from J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings\" (University of Utah Press, 2007). Elizabeth Solopova, \"Languages, Myth and History: An Introduction to the Linguistic and Literary Background of J. R. R. Tolkien's Fiction\" (New York City: North Landing Books, 2009) gives an overview of the linguistic traits of the various languages invented by Tolkien and the history of their creation.\n\nA few fanzines were dedicated to the subject, like \"Tyalië Tyelelliéva\" published by Lisa Star, and \"Quettar\", the Bulletin of the Linguistic Fellowship of The Tolkien Society, published by Julian C. Bradfield. \"Tengwestië\" is an online publication of the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship.\n\nInternet mailing lists and forums dedicated to Tolkien's constructed languages include Tolklang, Elfling and Lambengolmor.\n\nSince 2005, there has been an International Conference on J.R.R. Tolkien's Invented Languages, part of a series of biennial conferences at changing locations. They are open to everyone with a serious interest in Tolkien's invented languages. Attendees are encouraged to prepare, bring, and deliver a paper on any aspect of Tolkien's languages. At a past conference, held in Valencia in 2011, Helge K. Fauskanger presented a piece on Tolkien's use of \"mor\" as a syllable to denote evil.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "915027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=915027", "title": "Linguistic determinism", "text": "Linguistic determinism\n\nLinguistic determinism is the idea that language and its structures limit and determine human knowledge or thought, as well as thought processes such as categorization, memory, and perception. The term implies that people who speak different languages as their mother tongues have different thought processes. \n\nLinguistic determinism is the \"strong\" form of linguistic relativity (popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), which argues that individuals experience the world based on the structure of the language they habitually use. \n\nThough it played a considerable role historically, linguistic determinism is now discredited among mainstream linguists.\n\nThe principle of linguistic relativity (or, in other words, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis) in its strong deterministic form first found its clear expression in writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf. \n\nThe term \"Sapir–Whorf hypothesis” is considered a misnomer by linguists and academics, because Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf never co-authored any works (although they did work together, Sapir being Whorf’s mentor), and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later invention; Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often in their writings their views of this relativity principle are phrased in stronger or weaker terms. The two linguists were nevertheless among the first to formulate the principle of linguistic relativity.\n\nSapir exercised the idea that language is essential to understanding one’s worldview and that difference in language implies a difference in social reality. Though he never directly explored how language affects thought, significant traces of the linguistic relativity principle underlie his perception of language.\n\nWhorf took further and reformulated Sapir’s thought in his essay “Science and Linguistics”. His take on linguistic relativity was more radical: in Whorf’s view, the relationship between language and culture was a deterministic one and language played a crucial role in our perception of reality. Language is what gives the thought its expression and thus shapes it; in other words, thinking is determined by language. In \"Science and Linguistics\" Whorf stated that:\n\nAccording to Whorf, formulation of ideas and thoughts is not a rational independent process but is determined by particular grammar and vocabulary of the language in which these ideas are expressed. The world around is organized and made sense of by us through language.\n\nWhorf’s conclusion was largely based upon a close examination and extensive study of the Hopi Indian language. During earlier years, Whorf published a number of essays in which he analyzed various linguistic aspects of Hopi. For example, a work called “An American Indian model of the universe” (1936) explores the implications of the Hopi verb system with regard to conception of space and time. \n\nIn the course of his research, Whorf noticed that Hopi and some other languages (Hebrew, Aztec and Maya) were built on a different plan from that of English and many other languages which he called SAE (Standard Average European) languages. He discovered a number of significant features differentiating Hopi from SAE languages that led him to the idea of linguistic determinism.\n\nFor example, Hopi is a ‘timeless’ language, whose verbal system lacks tenses. Its assessment of time is different from SAE linear temporal view of past, present and future and varies with each observer:\n\nHopi time is non-dimensional and cannot be counted or measured in a way SAE languages measure it, i.e. the Hopi will not say “I stayed six days,” but “I left on the sixth day.” What is crucial in their perception of time is whether an event can be warranted to have occurred, or to be occurring, or to be expected to occur. Hopi grammatical categories signify view of the world as an ongoing process, where time is not divided into fixed segments so that certain things recur, e.g. minutes, evenings, or days. The linguistic structure of SAE languages, on the other hand, gives its speakers more fixed, objectified and measurable understanding of time and space, where they distinguish between countable and uncountable objects and view time as a linear sequence of past, present, and future. \n\nWhorf argues that this and numerous other differences imply a different way of thinking. Since thought is expressed and transmitted through language, it follows that a differently structured language must shape thought along its lines, thus influencing perception. Consequently, a Hopi speaker who perceives the world through the medium of his language must see reality through the patterns laid down by its linguistic structure. \n\nOther studies supporting the principle of linguistic determinism have shown that people find it easier to recognize and remember shades of colors for which they have a specific name. For example, there are two words in Russian for different shades of blue, and Russian-speakers are faster at discriminating between the shades than are English-speakers.\n\nLinguistic determinism can also be evident in situations where the means of drawing attention to a certain aspect of an experience is language. For example, in French, Spanish or Russian there are two ways to address a person because those languages have two second person pronouns – singular and plural. The choice of the pronoun depends on the relationship between the two people (formal or informal) and the degree of familiarity between them. In this respect, the speaker of any of those languages is always thinking about the relationship when addressing another person and therefore unable to separate those two processes.\n\nAnother example is the Daniel Everett study analyzing conception of numbers in the Brazilian Pirahã people. These individuals could not conceive numbers beyond 'one' and 'two', for which there are no actual terms in their language. After this all numbers are grouped under the term 'many.' Even after being taught in the Portuguese language for eight months, not one individual could count to ten.\n\nHowever, linguistic determinism has been widely criticized for its absolutism and refuted by linguists. For instance, Michael Frank et. al continued Daniel Everett’s research and ran further experiments on the Pirahã published in \"Numbers as a cognitive technology,\" and found that Everett was wrong, the Pirahã did not have words for \"one,\" or \"two,\" but instead had words for \"small,\" \"somewhat larger,\" and \"many.\" \n\nAnother argument against the principle of linguistic determinism is that humans are able to perceive objects and events that have no corresponding words in our mental lexicon, even if existing linguistic representations would make the perception easier. Opponents of the theory maintain that thought exists prior to any conception of language. Steven Pinker's theory embodies this idea. He proposed that all individuals are first capable of a \"universal mentalese\", of which all thought is composed prior to its linguistic form. Language then enables us to articulate these already existing thoughts into words and linguistic concepts.\n\nFor example, one may perceive different colors even while missing a particular word for each shade, like New Guinea aborigines can distinguish between the colors green and blue even though they have only one lexical entry to describe both colors. In communities where language does not exist to describe color it does not mean the concept is void – rather the community may have a description or unique phrase to determine the concept. Everett describes his research into the Pirahã tribe who use language to describe color concepts in a different way to English speakers: “[…] each word for color in Pirahã was actually a phrase. For example, biísai did not mean simply ‘red’. It was a phrase that meant ‘it is like blood’.” \n\nThus, in its strong version ‘Whorfian hypothesis’ of linguistic determination of cognition has been refuted. In its weaker form, however, the proposal that language influences our thinking has frequently been discussed and studied.\n\nLinguistic determinism is a partial assumption behind a number of recent developments in rhetoric and literary theory. For example, French philosopher Jacques Derrida's dissected the terms of \"paradigmatic\" hierarchies (in language structures, some words exist only with antonyms, such as light/dark, and others exist only with relation to other terms, such as father/son and mother/daughter; Derrida targeted the latter). He believed that if one breaks apart the hidden hierarchies in language terms, one can open up a \"lacuna\" in understanding, an \"aporia,\" and free the mind of the reader/critic. Similarly, Michel Foucault's New Historicism theory posits that there is a quasi-linguistic structure present in any age, a metaphor around which all things that can be understood are organized. This \"episteme\" determines the questions that people can ask and the answers they can receive. The episteme changes historically: as material conditions change, so the mental tropes change, and vice versa. When ages move into new epistemes, the science, religion, and art of the past age look absurd. Some Neo-Marxist historians have similarly looked at culture as permanently encoded in a language that changes with the material conditions. As the environment changes, so too do the language constructs.\n\nThe possibility of linguistic determinism has been explored by a variety of authors, mostly in science fiction. There exist some languages, like Loglan, Ithkuil and Toki Pona for instance, which have been constructed for the purpose of testing the assumption. However, no formal tests appear to have been done.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19968159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19968159", "title": "Louisiana French", "text": "Louisiana French\n\nLouisiana French (, Louisiana Creole: \"françé la lwizyàn\") refers to the complex of dialects and varieties of the French language spoken traditionally in colonial Lower Louisiana. As of today Louisiana French is primarily used in the U.S. state of Louisiana, specifically in the southern parishes, though substantial minorities exist in southeast Texas as well. Over the centuries, the language has incorporated some words of African, Spanish, Native American and English origin, sometimes giving it linguistic features found only in Louisiana, but it remains mutually intelligible with other forms of the French language. Figures from the United States Census record that roughly 3.5% of Louisianans over the age of 5 report speaking French or a French-based creole at home. Distribution of these speakers is uneven, however, with the majority residing in the south-central region known as Acadiana. Some of the Acadiana parishes register francophone populations of 10% or more of the total, with a select few (such as Vermilion, Evangeline and St. Martin Parishes) exceeding 15%.\n\nThe language is spoken across ethnic and racial lines by people who identify as Cajun or Louisiana Creole as well as Chitimacha, Houma, Biloxi, Tunica, Choctaw, Acadian, and French among others. For these reasons, as well as the relatively small influence Acadian French has had on the language, the label Louisiana French or Louisiana Regional French is generally regarded as more accurate and inclusive than \"Cajun French\" and is preferred term by linguists and anthropologists. However, \"Cajun French\" is commonly used in lay discourse by speakers of the language and other inhabitants of Louisiana.\n\nLouisiana French should further not be confused with Louisiana Creole, a distinct French-based creole language indigenous to Louisiana and spoken across racial lines. In Louisiana, language labels are often conflated with ethnic labels. For example, a speaker who identifies as Cajun may call their language \"Cajun French\", though linguists would identify it as Louisiana Creole.\n\nParishes in which the dialect is still found include but are not limited to Acadia, Ascension, Assumption, Avoyelles, Cameron, Evangeline, Iberia, Jefferson Davis, Lafayette, Lafourche, St. Martin, St. Mary, Terrebonne, Pointe Coupée, Vermillion, and other parishes of southern Louisiana.\n\nStarting in the second half of the 17th century, several trading posts were established in Lower Louisiana () eventually giving way to greater French colonial aspirations with the turn of the century. French immigration was at its peak during the 17th and 18th centuries which firmly established the Creole culture and language there. One important distinction to make is that the term \"créole\" at the time was consistently used to signify native, or \"locally-born\" in contrast to \"foreign-born\". In general the core of the population was rather diverse, coming from all over the French colonial empire namely Canada, France, and the French West Indies.Eventually, with the consistent relations built between the Native American tribes and francophones, new vocabulary was adopted into the colonial language. For example, something of a \"French-Choctaw patois\" is said to have developed primarily among Louisiana's Afro-French population and \"métis\" Creoles with a large portion of its vocabulary said to be of Native American origin. Prior to the late arrival of the Acadian people in Louisiana, the French of Louisiana had already begun to undergo changes as noted by Captain Jean-Bernard Bossu who traveled with and witnessed Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne speaking this \"common language.\" This unusual blend of French was also noticed by Pierre-Clement de Laussat during a lunch visit with the Creole-French Canterelle family. Upon the arrival of their Houma relatives, the family began conversing in \"French and Choctaw.\" Additional witness to this variety of French comes from J.F.H. Claiborne, a cousin of Louisiana's first American Governor, who also noted the \"unusual patois of provincial French and Choctaw.\"\n\nStarting in 1755, large populations of the French-speaking Acadians began to arrive en masse along the Mississippi River as well as eventually arriving all the way to south to the modern-day state of Louisiana following the Great Upheveal. In 1762, France relinquished their territorial claims to Spain just as Acadians had begun to arrive; despite this, Spanish Governor Bernardo de Gálvez, permitted the Acadians to continue to speak their language as well as observe their other cultural practices. The original Acadian community was composed mainly of farmers and fishermen who were able to provide their children with a reasonable amount of schooling. However, the hardships after being exiled from Nova Scotia, along with the difficult process of resettlement in Louisiana and the ensuing poverty made it difficult to establish schools in the early stages of the community’s development. Eventually schools were established, as private academies whose faculty had recently arrived in Louisiana from France or who had been educated in France. Children were usually able to attend the schools only long enough to learn counting and reading. At the time, a standard part of a child’s education in the Cajun community was also the Catholic catechism, which was taught in French by an older member of the community. The educational system did not allow for much contact with Standard French. It has often been said that Acadian French has had a large impact on the development of Louisiana French but this has generally been over-estimated.\n\nFrench immigration continued in the 19th century until the start of the American Civil War, bringing large numbers of francophones speaking something more similar to today's Metropolitan French to Louisiana. Over time, through contact between different ethnic groups the various dialects converged to produce what we know as Louisiana French.\n\nThe strong influence of English-language education on the francophone community began following the American Civil War, when laws that had protected the rights of French speakers were abolished. Public schools that attempted to force francophones to learn English were established in Louisiana. Parents viewed the practice of teaching their children English as the intrusion of a foreign culture, and many refused to send their children to school. When the government required them to do so, they selected private French Catholic schools in which class was conducted in French. The French schools worked to emphasize Standard French, which they considered to be the prestige dialect. When the government required all schools, public and parochial, to teach in English, new teachers, who could not speak French, were hired. Children could not understand their teachers and generally ignored them by continuing to speak French. Eventually, children became punished for speaking French on school grounds.\n\nThe punishment system seems to have been responsible for much of the decay that Louisiana French experienced in the 20th century since, in turn, people who could not speak English were perceived as uneducated. Therefore, parents became hesitant to teach French to their children, hoping that the children would have a better life in an English-speaking nation. As of 2011, there are an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people in Louisiana who speak French. By comparison, there were an estimated one million native French-speakers in Louisiana in about 1968. The dialect is now at risk of extinction as children are no longer taught it formally in schools.\n\nMany question whether the Louisiana French language will survive another generation. Some residents of Acadiana are bilingual though, having learned French at home and English in school. Currently, Louisiana French is considered an endangered language.\n\nMarilyn J. Conwell of Pennsylvania State University conducted a study of Louisiana French in 1959 and published \"probably the first complete study of a Louisiana French dialect,\" \"Louisiana French Grammar\", in 1963. Conwell focused on the French spoken in Lafayette, Louisiana, and evaluated what was then its current status. Conwell pointed out that the gradual decline of French made it \"relatively common\" to find \"grand-parents who speak only French, parents who speak both French and English, children who speak English and understand French, and grand-children who speak and understand only English.\" The decision to teach French to children was well-received since grandparents hoped for better opportunities for communicating with their grandchildren.\n\nThe Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) was established in 1968 to promote the preservation of French language and culture in Louisiana. In addition to this, some Louisiana universities, such as Louisiana State University, offer courses in \"Cajun French\" in the hopes of preserving the language.\n\nThe Louisiana state legislature has greatly shifted its stance on the status of French. Since the passage of Legislative Act No. 409 in 1968, the Louisiana governor is granted the authorization \"to establish the Council for the Development of Louisiana-French\" and that the agency is to consist of no more than fifty members, including a chairman. The name was soon changed to CODOFIL and was granted the power to \"do anything possible and necessary to encourage the development, usage and preservation of French as it exists in Louisiana.\n\nIn 1984, Jules O. Daigle, a Roman Catholic priest, published \"A Dictionary of the Cajun Language\" the first dictionary devoted to \"Cajun French.\" Once considered an authority on the language, it is not exhaustive; it omits alternate spellings and synonyms that Father Daigle deemed \"perversions\" of the language but are nonetheless popular among so-called Louisiana French speakers and writers. Though remaining useful today, Daigle's dictionary has been superseded by the \"Dictionary of Louisiana French\" (2010), edited by Albert Valdman and other authorities on the language.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, various signage, packaging, and documentation in French became present throughout the state. State and local tourism bureau commissions were influential in convincing city, parish and state officials to produce bilingual signage and documentation. French and English bilingual signage is, therefore, usually confined to the old districts of cities, like the French Quarter in New Orleans, downtown Lafayette and New Iberia (trilingual with Spanish), St. Martinville, Breaux Bridge, as well as several other cities. Locals continue to refer to the place names in English and for postal services, English is generally preferred. To meet the demands of a growing francophone tourist market, tourism bureaus and commissions throughout the state, particularly in southern Louisiana, have information on tourist sites in both French and English as well as in other major languages spoken by tourists.\n\nMany young adults are learning enough French to understand French music lyrics. Also, there is now a trend to use French language websites to learn the dialect. Culinary words and terms of endearment such as \"cher\" (dear) and \"nonc\" (uncle) are still heard among otherwise English-speaking Louisianians.\n\nAn article written online by the Université Laval argues that the state of Louisiana's shift, from an anti-French stance to one of soft promotion has been of great importance to the survival of the language. The article states that it is advantageous to invigorate the revival of the language, to better cherish the state's rich heritage, and to protect a francophone minority that has suffered greatly from negligence by political and religious leaders. Furthermore, the university's article claims that it is CODOFIL rather than the state itself which sets language policy; the only political stance the state of Louisiana makes is that of noninterference. All of this culminates in the fact that outside the extremely southern portions of the state, French remains a secondary language that retains heavy cultural and identity values.\n\nAccording to Jacques Henry, former executive director of CODOFIL, much progress has been made for francophones and that the future of French in Louisiana is not merely a symbolic one. According to statistics gathered by CODOFIL, the past twenty years has seen widespread acceptance of French-immersion programs. He goes further to write that the official recognition, appreciation by parents, and inclusion of French in schools reflects growing regard of the language. Ultimately the survival of French in Louisiana can only be guaranteed by Louisianan parents and politicians, but that there is still hope.\n\nSimilarly, the state legislature passed the Louisiana French Language Services Act in 2011 with particular mention to cultural tourism, local culture, and heritage. The bill sets forth that each branch of the state government shall take necessary action to identify employees who are proficient in French. Each branch of the state government is to take necessary steps in producing services in the French language for both locals and visitors. This bill is, however, an unfunded state mandate. The legislative act was drafted and presented by francophone and francophile senators and representatives as it asserts that the French language is vital to the economy of the state.\n\nReliable counts of speakers of Louisiana French are difficult to obtain as distinct from other varieties of French. However, the vast majority of native residents of Louisiana and east and southeast Texas who speak French are likely speakers of Louisiana French.\n\nIn Louisiana, , the population of French speakers was approximately 115,183. These populations are concentrated most heavily in the southern, coastal parishes.\n\nIn Texas, , the French-speaking population was 55,773, though many of these were likely immigrants from France and other locations, living in the urban areas. Nevertheless, in the rural eastern/southeastern Texas counties of Orange, Jefferson, Chambers, Newton, Jasper, Tyler, Liberty, and Hardin alone—areas where it can be reasonably presumed that almost all French speakers are Louisiana French speakers—the total French-speaking population was composed of 3,400 individuals. It is likely a substantial portion of the 14,493 speakers in Houston's Harris county are also Louisiana French speakers. With this is mind, a marked decline in the number of French speakers in Texas has been noticed in the last half of the twentieth century. For example, at one point the French-speaking population of Jefferson County was 24,049 as compared to the mere 1,922 today. Likewise, in Harris County the French-speaking population has shifted from 26,796 to 14,493 individuals.\n\nLouisiana French-speaking populations can also be found in southern Mississippi and Alabama, as well as pockets in other parts of the United States.\n\nDespite ample time for Louisiana French to diverge, the basic grammatical core of the language remains similar or the same as Standard French. Even so, it can be expected that the language would begin to diverge due to the various influences of neighboring languages, changing francophone demographics, and unstable opportunities for education. Furthermore, Louisiana French lacks any official regulating body unlike that of Standard French or Quebec French to take part in standardizing the language.\n\n<br>\n<br>\nImmediately some distinct characteristics of Louisiana French can be gleaned from its personal pronouns. For example, the traditional third-person singular feminine pronoun \"elle\" of Standard French is present but also there is the alternative of \"alle\" which is chosen by some authors since it more closely approximates speakers' pronunciation. Also, use of the pronoun \"ils\" has supplanted the third-person feminine pronoun \"elles\" as it is used to refer to both masculine and feminine subjects. Similarly, all of the other third-person plural pronouns are neutral. The usage of \"-autres\" with plural pronouns is widespread in the language.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the use of some of the indicative verb tenses in Louisiana French, take the example of \"manger\" meaning to eat:\n\nSome minor simplification of tenses is exhibited in the conjugation of the verb \"manger\", namely of the plural first and second person conjugations which are inflected identically to the third person singular. Not only this, but the inflection of the third person plural verb form has diverged between the form identical to Standard French and the use of \"-ont\" in for all verbs.\n\nThe elision that is common in many aspects of French is accelerated in Louisiana French with the schwa in \"je\" often omitted regardless of the presence of a following vowel as well as the regular use of \"t'es (tu es) and t'as (tu as)\" as opposed to such avoidance in Standard French.\n\nThe present progressive tense of Louisiana French initially appears alien as compared to Standard French but \"après/apé\" possesses the same function signified by \"en train de\".\n\nUnlike Standard French, Louisiana French avoids article-preposition contractions involving the prepositions \"de,\" or \"des\":\n\n\nPlace names in Louisiana French usually differ from those in Standard French. For instance, locales named for American Indian tribes usually use the plural article \"les\" instead of the masculine or feminine singular articles \"le\" or \"la\". Likewise, the contraction \"aux\" (\"à\" and \"les\") is used with such locations. This trend seems to vary by region since in Pierre Part and Lafayette elderly francophones have often been heard to say \"la Californie, le Texas, la Floride\". In informal Louisiana French, most US states and countries are pronounced as in English and therefore require no article but in formal Louisiana French, prefixed articles are absent: \"Californie, Texas, Floride, Belgique, Liban\", etc\nCode-switching occurs frequently in Louisiana French but this is typical for many language contact situations. Code-switching was once viewed as a sign of poor education, but it is now understood to be an indication of proficiency in the two different languages that a speaker uses. Fluent Louisiana French speakers frequently alternate from French to English, but less proficient speakers will usually not.\n\nFrom a lexical perspective, Louisiana French differs little from other varieties of French spoken in the world. However, due to the unique history and development of the language, Louisiana French has many words that are unique to it or to select French varieties.\n\nFrancophones and creolophones have worked side-by-side, lived among one another, and have enjoyed local festivities together throughout the history of the state. As a result, in regions where both Louisiana French and Louisiana Creole are or used to be spoken, the inhabitants of the region often code-switch, beginning the sentence in one language and completing it in another.\n\nTaxonomies for classing Louisiana French have changed over time. Until the 1960s and 1970s, Louisianans themselves, when speaking in French, referred to their language as \"français\" or \"créole\". In English, they referred to their language as \"Creole French\" and \"French\" simultaneously.\n\nIn 1968, Lafayette native James Domengeaux, a US Representative, created the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), whose mission was to oversee the promotion, visibility, and expansion of French language usage in Louisiana. His mission was clear: (re)create a European French bastion in Louisiana by making all Louisianans bilingual in International French and English. To accomplish his goals, he teamed up with political leaders in Canada and France, including former French President Georges Pompidou. He found Louisiana French too limiting, so he imported francophone teachers from Europe, Canada and the Caribbean to teach normative French in Louisiana schools. His penchant for International French caused him to lose support in Louisiana: most Louisianans, if they were going to have French in Louisiana schools, wanted Louisiana French, not \"Parisian French.\"\n\nSimultaneously, an ethnic movement took root in southern Louisiana led by Acadian-Creoles like James Donald Faulk, Dudley Joseph Leblanc and Jules O. Daigle. Faulk, a French teacher in Crowley, Louisiana, introduced using the term \"Cajun French\" for Acadian-Creoles and French Creoles who identified as Cajun, for which he created a curriculum guide for institutionalizing the language in schools in 1977. Roman Catholic Priest Jules O. Daigle, who in 1984 published his \"Dictionary of the Cajun Language\", followed him. \"Cajun French\" is intended to imply the French spoken in Louisiana by descendants of Acadians, an ethnic qualifier rather than a linguistic relationship.\n\nIn 2009, Iberia Parish native and activist Christophe Landry introduced three terms representing lexical differences based on Louisiana topography: Provincial Louisiana French (PLF), Fluvial Louisiana French (FLF), and Urban Louisiana French (ULF). That same year, the \"Dictionary of Louisiana of Louisiana French: As Spoken in Cajun, Creole, and American Indian Communities\", was published. It was edited by a coalition of linguists and other activists. The title clearly suggests that the ethno-racial identities are mapped onto the languages, but the language, at least linguistically, remains shared across those ethno-racial lines.\n\nDue to present ethnic movements and internal subdivisions among the population, some of the state's inhabitants insist are ancestral varieties. As a result, it is not odd to hear the language referred to as Canadian French, Acadian French, Broken French, Old French, Creole French, Cajun French, and so on. Still other Louisiana francophones will simply refer to their language as French, without qualifiers. Internally, two broad distinctions will be made: informal Louisiana French and formal Louisiana French.\n\nProbably the widely used variety of the language, informal Louisiana French has its roots in agrarian Louisiana, but it is now also found in urban centers because of urbanization beginning in the 20th century. Historically, along the prairies of southwest Louisiana, francophone Louisianans were cattle grazers as well as rice and cotton farmers. Along the bayous and the Louisiana littoral, sugar cane cultivation dominated and in many parishes today, sugar cultivation remains an important source of economy. Informal Louisiana French can at least be divided further into three core varieties: Fluvial, Provincial, and Bayou Lafourche Louisiana French.\n\nThe phonology of these varieties, apart from some minor distinctions, are rather similar and distinct in comparison to the international francophone community. A key feature of the dialect would likely be the pronunciation of the letter \"r\" as an alveolar consonant rather than a uvular consonant like in Standard French. Vowels are commonly omitted from the beginning and end of for words: \"\"américain\" → méricain\" or \"\"espérer → spérer\".\" Likewise, the letter \"é\" preceding \"o\" frequently erodes in the spoken informal varieties: \"\"léonide\" → \"lonide\" or \"cléophas\" → \"clophas\".\" The nasality and pitch of the language is akin to that associated with provincial speech in Québec. In terms of nasality, Louisiana French is similar to French spoken in Brussels and Dakar, Senegal. The pitch of Provincial Louisiana French and Provincial Quebec French share a predominantly agricultural history, close contact with Amerindian groups and relative isolation from urbanized populations.\n\nParticular mention should be made to the francophones of Bayou Lafourche, who speak a linguistic feature that is absent everywhere else in Louisiana. Some francophones along Bayou Lafourche pronounce the letters \"g\" and \"j\" as an voiceless glottal fricative, but others pronounce the two letters in the manner of most other francophones.\n\nTwo theories exist to explain the feature:\n\n\nThe Louisiana Creole spoken in Lafourche Parish in and around Kraemer, Choctaw, and Chackbay contains the letters \"g\" and \"j\", but they are voiced as they are in all other varieties of Louisiana and French spoken elsewhere.\n\nThis variety is known for its use in all administrative and ecclesiastic documents, speeches and in literary publications. Also known as Urban Louisiana French, Colonial French, or Plantation Society French, it is spoken primarily in the urban business centers of the state. Because those regions have historically been centers of trade and commerce with contact French speakers from Europe, it is regarded as a more conservative variety of the language. Areas where this formal variety can be heard include New Orleans, Baton Rouge, St. Martinville, and other once important francophone business centers in the state. Generally formal Louisiana French is maintained along strict class lines.\n\nThe phonology of formal Louisiana French shares much in common with Standard French to various degrees depending upon the speaker. As an example, speakers can be heard pronouncing \"r\" as a uvular constant as opposed to an alveolar. Furthermore, the pronunciation and intonation of this variety can vary from European to the North American varieties of French. Use of the pronouns \"nous\" and \"vous\" are far more prevalent in the register as \"nous\" has been supplanted by \"on\" in the informal varieties.\n\nMedicine men and women, or healers (), are still found throughout the state. During their rituals for healing, they use secret French prayers to God or saints for a speedy recovery. These healers are mostly Catholic and do not expect compensation or even thanks, as it is said that then, the cure will not work.\n\nLouisiana French has been the traditional language for singing music now referred to as Cajun, zydeco, and Louisiana French rock. As of today, Old French music, Creole stomp, and Louisiana French rock remain the only three genres of music in Louisiana using French instead of English. Most \"Cajun\" artists have expressions and phrases in French in songs, predominantly sung in English.\n\n\nToday one can find many local groups dedicated to practicing Louisiana French regularly, usually over a meal with other interested parties. Many of said groups can be found through the Cajun French Virtual Table Française:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of autumn 2011, Louisiana has French-language total immersion or bilingual French and English immersion in ten parishes: Calcasieu, Acadia, St. Landry, St. Martin, Iberia, Lafayette, Assumption, East Baton Rouge, Jefferson and Orleans. The curriculum in both the total French-language immersion as well as in the bilingual program follows the same standards as all other schools in the parish and state.\n\nThe Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL) recruits teachers locally and globally each year. Additionally, Les Amis de l'Immersion, Inc. is the parent-teacher organization for students in French immersion in the state which organizes summer camps, fundraisers and outreach for teachers, parents and students in the program.\n\nThe Consortium of Louisiana Universities and Colleges unites representatives of French programs in Louisiana universities and colleges, and organizes post-secondary level francophone scholastic exchanges and provide support for university students studying French language and linguistics in Louisiana:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It also co-produces several anime series, including \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"\", \"\" and \"Eon Kid\", usually through financial contributions toward production costs.\n\nThe American branch was established in 1991 following the acquisition of the UK rights to \"Akira\", by Laurence Guinness, who was the Head of Acquisition and Development at Island World Communications. Andy Frain, was the Managing Director of Island World Communications; a loss-making subsidiary at the time of Chris Blackwell and John Heyman's Island World Group.\n\nManga has also played a part in dubbing anime, when it is not sub-licensing a production that has already been licensed by another company (e.g., \"Akira\", licensed and redubbed by Geneon in 2001, \"Bounty Dog\", and \"\"). It is also the designated home video distributor for the \"Pokémon\" franchise in the UK, including some of the movies apart from the ones distributed by Miramax (among them \"\").\n\nDespite its name, the company's principal business is the distribution of anime rather than manga, although they have published some manga, such as \"Crying Freeman\", in the United Kingdom under the Manga Books imprint.\n\nSince 2005, Manga Entertainment UK has operated independently from its American branch, even though both companies were still owned by IDT Entertainment and later Starz Media. In 2011, the American branch ceased licensing new products after the release of Redline and went dormant. In 2015, the U.K branch would be bought from Starz Media alongside its parent Anchor Bay UK to managing director Colin Lomax. Anchor Bay UK was renamed to Platform Entertainment and went on to have exclusive rights to the Manga Entertainment branding and catalog in the UK and Ireland. Currently, Manga Entertainment UK have licensing and distribution deals with Funimation, Sentai Filmworks and Viz Media. Unlike previous licensing agreements, however, they do not bring titles from Funimation, Sentai, and Viz to Australia under their brand as Manga's Australian distributor; Madman Entertainment has the licenses from these companies.\n\nIn December 2016, Platform Entertainment would be bought by Kaleidoscope Film Distribution, who split Manga UK off to become a separate entity.\n\nIn 2017, Lionsgate Home Entertainment, the new owner of the dormant US branch, relaunched the Manga.com website and Facebook page, and planning a re-launch in the near future. Lionsgate currently licenses the Manga Entertainment brand-name from the now non-related UK branch.\n\nManga Entertainment expanded into Australia in late 1993 when Manga's main headquarters were still based in London. Although initially Manga's titles were to be released in Australia by PolyGram who owned Island and Manga, they decided to sub-license their properties to Siren Entertainment. In late 1996, Manga Entertainment UK gave the sub-distribution license to the newly founded Madman Entertainment who in turn were distributed by Siren. This meant that both Siren and Madman has equal rights to Manga's properties.\n\nIn 1997, PolyGram Australia gained the rights to some of Manga's more recent additions to its catalogue. This included \"Lupin the Third\" properties, except \"The Castle of Cagliostro\", and \"Violence Jack\". \"Violence Jack: Evil Town\" was banned in Australia, even when PolyGram submitted the UK cut to the Australian Government for classification. The other two OVAs in the series submitted were the uncut dubbed versions that were released in the USA by Critical Mass, however due to \"Evil Town\"s banning, PolyGram scrapped the release of \"Violence Jack\" in Australia. PolyGram already had the UK cut of \"Evil Town\" in circulation despite its banning.\n\nIn late 1996, Madman Entertainment was founded by former employees of Siren. They were given exclusive sub-license rights to Manga UK's catalogue, including Part 4 of \"Macross Plus\", which was released in 1997. Despite this, Madman did not take on some titles, e.g. \"RG Veda\" and \"Shadow Skill\", and let PolyGram Australia distribute them.\n\nSiren decided to license \"Street Fighter II V\" from Manga USA in 1997 and released the series without input from Madman, as Madman also had an exclusive licensing deal with ADV Films, who had licensed \"Street Fighter II V\" in the UK and re-dubbed it. This property was taken over by Madman in 1999. In this same time period Manga Entertainment had licensed \"Voltron\" exclusively for the Australian market and was released by Siren instead of Polygram Australia.\n\nIn 1998, after Manga was purchased by former Island CEO Chris Blackwell, Madman Entertainment was given the rights to the entire Manga catalogue from Manga's UK and USA subsidiaries except \"Street Fighter II V\", which was still licensed by Siren. Manga Entertainment has since had a special relationship with Madman Entertainment and Manga was credited by many as the major force behind turning Anime into mainstream entertainment in Australia during the 1990s and early 2000s. Manga's latest DVD and Blu-ray masters are encoded and provided by Madman Entertainment because of Madman's extremely large and modern DVD and Blu-ray authoring division.\n\nIn 1999, Siren relinquished its licensing deal with Manga UK and its separate deal for \"SFII: V\" from Manga USA as Madman had become big enough for Siren to make the same amount of profit distributing for them as it was when it was the sole distributor of Manga products in Australia.\n\nIn 2001, Siren Entertainment restructured itself and split the company into 2 separate entities: Siren Visual and The AV Channel. Madman's founders who were former employees of the company and owned shares of Siren decided to take The AV Channel and turn it into Madman's distribution arm which was absorbed into Madman in 2008.\n\nMadman Entertainment in the mid 2000s decided to align itself with Manga USA, but since the dawn of Blu-ray and Manga USA turning into an online and television distributor of anime, Madman has re-aligned itself with Manga UK. Both companies funded and co-produced the PAL region dub of \"\" and co-produce DVDs and Blu-rays. Madman provides Manga UK with PAL DVD and some Blu-ray masters due to Madman's larger and more sophisticated authoring division. Manga and Madman co-license properties such as the \"Rebuild of Evangelion\" movies, \"\" & the \"Ghost In The Shell\" franchise among others.\n\nIn January 2007, the company's United Kingdom division began releasing a fortnightly magazine aimed at promoting both the company itself through the use of some of its more revered titles. Issue one, for example, used \"Ghost in the Shell\". The magazine had published 102 issues. The company also has an official website for the UK division, as well as an online shop. After the take over by Lionsgate for the American branch, the UK branch of Manga Entertainment still exists to this day, running independently distributing DVD's and Blu-ray titles for the UK market, acquiring licenses from various companies.\n\nIt was announced in October 2011 that Microsoft formed partnerships with over 50 content providers worldwide, including Manga Entertainment. This feature was to be available at no extra cost to US subscribers after the new Xbox dashboard update due sometime in December 2011.\n"}

Masonry veneer can have an air space behind it and is technically called \"anchored veneer\". A masonry veneer attached directly to the backing is called \"adhered veneer\". The innermost element is usually structural wall, and may consist of concrete masonry (often called a Cavity wall where inner and outer layers are both structural), concrete, wood or metal frame. \n\nBecause brick itself isn't waterproof, the airspace also functions as a drainage plane, allowing any water that has penetrated the veneer to drain to the bottom of the air space, where it encounters flashing (weatherproofing) and is directed to the outside through weep holes, rather than entering the building. \n\nOther advantages of a masonry veneer include:\n\nBecause the masonry veneer is non-structural, it must be tied back to the building structure to prevent movement under wind and earthquake loads. Brick ties are used for this purpose, and may take the form of corrugated metal straps nailed or screwed to the structural framing, or as wire extensions to horizontal joint reinforcement in a fully masonry veneer or cavity wall. Although the veneer is vertically self-supporting, shelf angles are often used in multi-story buildings, typically at floor edges, to provide a horizontal expansion joint that allows expansion of the brick and potential shrinkage of the frame. In multi-story buildings, such a system may be called a curtain wall. Adhered masonry veneer is bonded to the backing so it does not typically need a shelf angle.\n\nMasonry veneers can be made of brick, concrete, natural stone or manufactured stone product. Typically, masonry refers to individual units that are placed in a mortar bed, making a distinction with panelized products.\n\nA variant on masonry veneer is the rain screen veneer. Rain screens are ventilated at the top and bottom of the cavity to prevent wind-driven rain from being driven into the building by unbalanced pressure. Such systems are typically encountered in areas where blowing rain is a significant concern.\n\nMasonry has high thermal mass, so masonry is slower to heat up, and can continue to release heat long into the night; without insulation half of that heat will be released into the building. Masonry with a dark external surface absorbs more heat than with a lighter external surface, especially if exposed to sunlight. Reverse masonry veneer walls have the brickwork inside and the lightweight frame and cladding outside; this has the advantage of providing the thermal mass on the inside of a building.\n\nMasonry itself provides very little insulation, however: \nDifferent configurations of such foil(s), air-space(s), and/or insulating material(s) can perform significantly better at excluding heat during summer and/or retaining heat during winter; these configurations often perform in counter-intuitive ways. Because of the enormous long-term potential for reducing energy requirements and improving occupant comfort, building designers should consult engineers or adopt configurations with known performances.\n\n"}

{"id": "532189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=532189", "title": "Nearshoring", "text": "Nearshoring\n\nNearshoring is the outsourcing of business processes, especially information technology processes, to companies in a nearby country, often sharing a border with the target country. Both parties expect to benefit from one or more of the following dimensions of proximity: geographic, temporal (time zone), cultural, social, linguistic, economic, political, or historical linkages.\nThe service work that is being sourced may be a business process or software development.\n\nNearshoring is a type of outsourcing where a given company seeks a development partner in a different country or region. However, what distinguishes nearshoring from other types of outsourcing is the fact that the development partner is still in close proximity. Since companies are usually in the same time zone, this facilitates communication and allows for frequent visits.\n\nNearshoring is a derivative of the business term offshoring.\n\nOffshoring involves shifting work to a foreign, distant organization in order to reduce production costs. Offshoring is subject to several different constraints, however, such as time lag between the parties, differences in local employment laws and practices, and oversight. A Western European IT company, say, might outsource software writing to a company in India, which specialises in such work, to take advantage of low cost, and skilled labour with a common language, but the distance between the two means reduced face contact, therefore less control of the project, and greater vulnerability to threats such as intellectual property theft and fraud.\n\nIn contrast, nearshoring means that the business has shifted work to a lower cost organization, but within its own region, broadly defined. \n\nIn Europe, nearshoring relationships are between clients in larger European economies and various providers in smaller European nations. Major centers are in Spain, Czech Republic, Hungary, Portugal, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Belarus and the Baltic. There are also nearshore centers in larger markets, such as Russia and Ukraine. These destinations are attractive because they are low-cost, have skilled labor forces, and a less stringent regulatory environment, but crucially they allow for more day to day physical oversight. They also have strong cultural ties to the major economic centers in Europe. For example, Bulgaria is now considered to be a viable outsourcing destination for such companies as German software company SAP, where labor costs are low, and the skills available, but which is also closer to home. In 2009, the Central-Eastern European Outsourcing Association (CEEOA) published research estimating that the Eastern European region has over 95,000 IT specialists involved in the industry, working for close to 5000 companies. \n\nIn the USA, American clients nearshore to Canada and Mexico, or both, as well as to many other nations in Central and South America, like Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica or El Salvador, and the Caribbean, to the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Jamaica, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nA popular type of nearshoring is in software development, with the main benefit being many skilled developers available at low cost. Call centers, shared services centers, and BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) are also common choices for nearshoring, as the value of offshore outsourcing hotbeds like Philippines lowers. \n\nThe complexity of offshoring stems from different languages and cultures, long distances and different time zones, spending more time and effort on establishing trust and long-term relationships, overriding communication barriers and activities of that kind. Many nearshore providers attempted to circumvent communication and project management barriers by developing new ways to align organizations. As a result, concepts such as remote insourcing were created to give clients more control in managing their own projects. Despite recent developments, nearshoring does not necessarily overcome all of the barriers, but the proximity allows more flexibility to align organizations. \n\nNearshoring has become a differentiator for those nations and providers who wish to set themselves apart from sourcing centers in Asia, especially the dominant India, which itself is seeing a sharp decline in BPO job growth.\n\nThe English language is the cornerstone of any Nearshore BPO or IT services operation, and has become a sought-after skill as companies strive to capture a larger chunk of the US market. With the triple helix of university, industry, and government all collaborating to develop the language further, the hunt for skilled, English-speaking talent is slowly becoming easier.\n\n"}

In general, Leggett's attempt is to \"indirectly\" observe superposition at the macroscopic level by \"extending\" current microscopic quantum physics to the macroscopic level. \n\nIn contrast, Gomatam is attempting to develop MQM \"independent of the application of the Schrödinger equation to the micro regime\", in such a manner that quantum superposition can be \"directly\" observed at the macroscopic level. This involves introducing a new notion of macroscopic objects as quantum \"kinds\", instead of classical \"objects\". In this regard, he is also developing two further new ideas within physics: the ontology of \"Objective, Semantic Information\" (OSI) and corresponding \"Relational Properties\" (RPs).\n\nAs part of developing his version of MQM, Gomatam has related interests in exotic manifolds, semantic information processing, quantum computation, and philosophy of ordinary language.\n\n\n\n"}

ROILA is being developed by the Department of Industrial Design at Eindhoven University of Technology. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the user, and optimized for efficient recognition by robots. ROILA has a syntax that allows it to be useful for many different kinds of robots, including the Roomba, and Lego Mindstorms NXT. ROILA is free for anybody to use and to contribute to, as the team has released all documentation and tools under a Creative Commons license.\n\nROILA was developed due to the need for a unified language for humans to speak to robots. The designers performed research into the ability of robots to recognize and interpret natural languages. They discovered that natural languages can be very confusing for robots to interpret sometimes, due to elements such as homophones and tenses. Based on this research, the team set out to create a genetic algorithm that would generate an artificial vocabulary in a way that would be easy for a human to pronounce. The algorithm used the most common phonemes from the most popular natural languages and created easy to pronounce words. The team took the results of this algorithm and formed the ROILA vocabulary.\n\nROILA has an isolating grammar, meaning that it doesn't have suffixes or prefixes added to words to change their meanings. Instead, these changes are constructed by adding word markers that specify what the changes are, such as the tense of the previous verb. For example, in English the suffix “ed” is added to a word to show that it is in the past tense, but in ROILA the marker word “jifi” is placed after the verb.\n\nBelow is the list of all letters and sounds used in ROILA:\nThe vocabulary of ROILA was generated by an algorithm designed to create a vocabulary with the least confusion amongst words. Each word generated by this algorithm was assigned a basic meaning, as taken from Basic English. The words from Basic English that are used the most frequently are assigned to the shortest ROILA words generated by the algorithm. A short list of words in ROILA is included below, along with their English meaning.\nROILA was designed to have a regular grammar, with no exceptions to anything. All rules apply to all words in a part of speech. Due to the simple isolating type grammar of ROILA whole word markers are added following parts of speech to show the grammatical category. For example, a word marker placed after a verb type would apply a tense, while a word marker applied after a noun type would apply plurality. ROILA has five parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and pronouns. The only pronouns are I, you, he, and she. Sentences follow a subject–verb–object word order.\n\nThe following examples attempt to show what the syntax of the language looks like in various uses.\nROILA is currently only available for the Lego Mindstorms NXT. It uses the CMU Sphinx speech recognition library to interpret spoken commands to the NXT, and transform them into ROILA commands.\n"}

She is mainly known for her figurines and reliefs.\n\nMilles was born Ruth Anna Maria Anderson on Örby Manor in Vallentuna near Stockholm, Sweden. She was the daughter of Chief Verifier of the brännvin manufacturing in Sweden, Emil Anderson (1843–1910), called \"Mille\". She had two siblings when her mother died in childbirth and gained three half siblings after her father remarried. Her brother was the sculptor Carl Milles (1875–1955) and her half brother Evert Milles (1885–1960) was an architect. Unlike her brother Carl, Milles was a college educated artist. She studied at the \"Tekniska Skolan\" (the Technical School), predecessor to the Konstfack University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm in 1892–93, after which she went on to the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1894–98, where she was considered talented enough to skip a year. She would also visit the Theosophical Society which became influential for her future works.\n\nIn the autumn of 1898, Milles left for Paris, approximately a year after her brother Carl had moved there. She studied at the Académie Colarossi and École des Beaux-Arts, and used Paris as base for journeys through France and Germany. Milles and her brother spent much time together in Paris where they collaborated, artistically and economically, in a joint company they started. Among other things, the company sold small bronze figurines, depicting children and characters from fairy tales made by her. She spent the summers in the fishing village Briac in Bretagne where she would draw inspiration from the local fishers' life for her sculptures. Her sculptures were made in an early Impressionistic style. While in France, she and her brother changed their surname to Milles after their father's nickname. In 1902, she received an honorary award at the Salon in Paris. The next year she fell ill with tuberculosis. She travelled back to Sweden and settled down in Islinge on Lidingö, where she set up a studio which she sometimes shared with the wife of her brother Carl, Olga Milles.\n\nMilles got many commissions from cultural institutions in Stockholm, among them the Royal Dramatic Theatre for medallions and busts of the singer Jenny Lind and the actor Georg Dahlqvist. In 1904–16, she participated in a number of international exhibitions like in St. Louis (1905) and Buenos Aires (1910), where she received silver medals for her work, Rome (1911), the world's fair in San Francisco (1915) and the Swedish art exhibition in Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition, Denmark (1916). However, her failing health forced her to abandon her sculpturing and she turned first to painting and later to writing instead. She also made illustrations for books, her own and those of other writers.\n\nIn 1932, she moved to Rome. Her health deteriorated, among other things she contracted gangrene and had one of her legs amputated. Milles died in Rome in 1941 and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome.\n\nMilles is represented in the Nationalmuseum and the Thielska Galleriet. There is also a bust and a painting by her in the home (\"Strand\" by lake Vättern) of Ellen Key.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4349962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4349962", "title": "Source–filter model", "text": "Source–filter model\n\nThe source–filter model models speech as a combination of a sound source, such as the vocal cords, and a linear acoustic filter, the vocal tract (and radiation characteristic). An important assumption that is often made in the use of the source-filter model is the independence of source and filter. In such cases, the model should more accurately be referred to as the \"independent source-filter model\".\n\nWhile only an approximation, the model is widely used in a number of applications because of its relative simplicity. To varying degrees, different phonemes can be distinguished by the properties of their source(s) and their spectral shape. Voiced sounds (e.g., vowels) have (at least) a source due to (mostly) periodic glottal excitation, which can be approximated by an impulse train in the time domain and by harmonics in the frequency domain, and a filter that depends on, e.g., tongue position and lip protrusion. On the other hand, fricatives have (at least) a source due to turbulent noise produced at a constriction in the oral cavity (e.g., the sounds represented orthographically by \"s\" and \"f\"). So called \"voiced fricatives\" (such as \"z\" and \"v\") have two sources - one at the glottis and one at the supra-glottal constriction.\n\nThe source-filter model is used in both speech synthesis and speech analysis, and is related to linear prediction. The development of the model is due, in large part, to the early work of Gunnar Fant, although others, notably Ken Stevens, have also contributed substantially to the models underlying acoustic analysis of speech and speech synthesis.\n\nIn implementation of the source-filter model of speech production, the sound source, or excitation signal, is often modelled as a periodic impulse train, for voiced speech, or white noise for unvoiced speech. The vocal tract filter is, in the simplest case, approximated by an all-pole filter, where the coefficients are obtained by performing linear prediction to minimize the mean-squared error in the speech signal to be reproduced. Convolution of the excitation signal with the filter response then produces the synthesised speech.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12689044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12689044", "title": "Speech-to-text reporter", "text": "Speech-to-text reporter\n\nA speech-to-text reporter (STTR), also known as a captioner, is a person who listens to what is being said and inputs it, word for word (verbatim), using an electronic shorthand keyboard or speech recognition software and a CAT software system. Their keyboard or speech recognition software is linked to a computer, which converts this information to properly spelled words. The reproduced text could then be read by deaf or hard-of-hearing people.\n\nThe latest in speech-to-text reporters are called Voice writers. Voicewriting is a method used for court reporting, and it is also used by some medical transcriptionists. Using the voicewriting method, a court reporter speaks directly into a stenomask or voice silencer—a hand-held mask containing one or two microphones and voice-dampening materials. A voice writing system consists of a stenomask, an external sound digitizer, a laptop, speech recognition software, and CAT software. A foot pedal can plug into a computer's USB port.\n\nA real-time voice writer's words go through the mask's cable to an external USB digital signal processor, From there the words go into the computer's speech recognition engine, for conversion into streaming text. The reporter can send the streamed text to a) the Internet; b) a computer file; c) a television station for subtitling; d) to an end-user who is reading the captions via their laptop, tablet, smart phone, or e) software which formats the results in a way most familiar to judges, attorneys, or subtitling consumers.\n\nVoice writers enjoy very high accuracy rates, based upon pure physiology. The route taken by a person's words goes from the mouth to the reporter's ear, brain, and \"inner\" voice. This form of repetition is naturally effortless; it is what we all do in our daily conversation, as we listen to a person speak, or when we read a book. So the most natural extension of this process is to psychologically switch the repetition mechanism from \"inner voice\" to the physiological \"spoken voice.\" Therefore, we minimize the introduction of cognitive overhead in our task of routing the spoken word to its permanent destination as printed words. This streamlined process allows voice writers to achieve excellent performance for many continuous hours and greater than 98 percent accuracy at speeds as high as 350 words per minute.\n\nVoice writers produce the same products as their stenotype colleagues, including transcripts in all electronic and printed formats. Realtime verbatim reporters connect their laptops to captioning equipment, real-time viewer programs, and provide attorneys or other clients with computer files at the end of the sessions. Only the physical way of capturing speakers' words differentiates voice writing from other methods of court reporting. Every other aspect of this profession is the same, with the exception of the time required to learn the skill, which is much shorter with voice writing.\n\nOther ways of producing speech-to-text: There are two types of keyboard used in the UK: the Palantype system and the Stenograph system. Hence STTRs are also sometimes referred to as palantypists and stenographers. Unlike a QWERTY keyboard, not every letter in a word is pressed, but several keys will be pressed at once which represent whole words, phrases or shortforms. Specially designed computer software will then convert these phonetic chords back into English which can then be displayed for someone to read.\n\nThe computer software can use a pre-programmed vocabulary specific to the context, information that matches syllable clusters to written forms, and may suggest alternative captions from which the STTR chooses. Errors occur from the STTR mishearing the words and from the need for the STTR to make a decision before an ambiguous statement is made clear by what is said next.\n\nThe professional association for STTRs is the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters. The Council for Advanced Communication with Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for the Deaf also give more information about STTRs.\n\nEvery word that is spoken will appear on the screen in an accessible format, although one can request a change in the color and font size. As well as every word spoken, the words \"NEW SPEAKER:\" will typically appear to denote when the speaker changes. If one sends the STTR (voice writer/palantypist/stenographer) the names of people attending the conference or meeting before the event, they, too, can be programmed into the computer, making it easier for one to recognize who is speaking. Other phrases, in curly brackets, may also appear, such as {laughter} or {applause}, to denote relevant events.\n\nOccasional mondegreen errors may be seen in closed-captions when the computer software fails to distinguish where a word break occurs in the syllable stream. For example, a news report of a \"grand parade\" might be captioned as a \"grandpa raid\". Mondegreens in this context arise from the need for captions to keep up with the fast pace of live television broadcasts.\n\nMany STTRs began their careers as court reporters. In the courts, the system was used to record proceedings and provide transcripts when requested. The skills developed in this area have also made them invaluable in the field of communication with deaf people, as they are used to producing work with an extremely high degree of accuracy and acting with complete discretion at all times. An STTR expects to reach consistent levels of accuracy of 98.5% and above.\n\nIn order to become an STTR one needs extensive training, typically two years, if a Palantype/Stenograph and the associated software, plus at least a further two years of practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience.\n\nIf becoming a voice writing STTR, the training is somewhat shorter, though nevertheless, just as strenuous. Two years to learn the art of voice writing includes the associated software and required practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience.\n\nOnly then is one ready to undertake the USA and/or UK Examinations for Certification. In the USA, NVRA and NCRA offer certifications that demonstrate the necessary training.\n\nThere are many levels of certification. NVRA certifies voice writers as court reporters, realtime reporters, CART providers, and broadcast captioners. Beyond any licensing considerations, NVRA certification clearly demonstrates that the voice writer has attained a level of professionalism and skill well above that of others in the field.\n\nThe NVRA certification testing program is available to all members. Tests are held at regular intervals throughout the year in various locations across the country.\n\nIn the UK, Unitised CACDP Examinations and membership with the CACDP Register, confirms that one has reached the required minimum standard. The majority of Registered STTRs are also Members of the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters.\n\n\n"}

After a brief introduction about the Klingon culture and also how the book has been written, the pronunciation of the Klingon letters is described. Instead of using phonetic symbols, the letters of the Latin alphabet are used, some of them written in upper case to distinguish special pronunciations. For instance q and Q are different sounds, and the combination ng is considered as one single letter. The largest part of the book is a description of the grammar, including briefly described rules sorted by type of words, accompanied by a few examples for each grammatical topic. The last part of the book contains a list of vocabulary with roughly 1,500 words, followed by a list of useful phrases.

{"id": "699422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=699422", "title": "Timber framing", "text": "Timber framing\n\nTimber framing and \"post-and-beam\" construction are traditional methods of building with heavy timbers, creating structures using squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs. It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered, and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect. The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany. Timber framed houses are spread all over the country.\n\nThe method comes from working directly from logs and tree rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber. Hewing this with broadaxes, adzes, and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers (brace and bit) and other woodworking tools, artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building. \n\nSince this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details.\n\nA simple timber frame made of straight vertical and horizontal pieces with a common rafter roof without purlins. The term \"box frame\" is not well defined and has been used for any kind of framing (with the usual exception of cruck framing). The distinction presented here is that the roof load is carried by the exterior walls. Purlins are also found even in plain timber frames.\n\nA cruck is a pair of crooked or curved timbers which form a bent (U.S.) or crossframe (UK); the individual timbers are each called a blade. More than 4,000 cruck frame buildings have been recorded in the UK. Several types of cruck frames are used; more information follows in English style below and at the main article Cruck.\n\n\nAisled frames have one or more rows of interior posts. These interior posts typically carry more structural load than the posts in the exterior walls. This is the same concept of the aisle in church buildings, sometimes called a hall church, where the center aisle is technically called a nave. However, a nave is often called an aisle, and three-aisled barns are common in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Germany. Aisled buildings are wider than the simpler box-framed or cruck-framed buildings, and typically have purlins supporting the rafters. In northern Germany, this construction is known as variations of a\" Ständerhaus\". \n\nHalf-timbering refers to a structure with a frame of load-bearing timber, creating spaces between the timbers called panels (in German \"Gefach\" or \"Fächer\"), which are then filled-in with some kind of nonstructural material known as infill. The frame is often left exposed on the exterior of the building.\n\nThe earliest known type of infill, called \"opus craticum\" by the Romans, was a wattle and daub type construction. \"Opus craticum\" is now confusingly applied to a Roman stone/mortar infill as well. Similar methods to wattle and daub were also used and known by various names, such as clam staff and daub, cat-and-clay, or \"torchis\" (French), to name only three.\n\nWattle and daub was the most common infill in ancient times. The sticks were not always technically wattlework (woven), but also individual sticks installed vertically, horizontally, or at an angle into holes or grooves in the framing. The coating of daub has many recipes, but generally was a mixture of clay and chalk with a binder such as grass or straw and water or urine. When the manufacturing of bricks increased, brick infill replaced the less durable infills and became more common. Stone laid in mortar as an infill was used in areas where stone rubble and mortar were available.\n\nOther infills include \"bousillage\", fired brick, unfired brick such as adobe or mudbrick, stones sometimes called \"pierrotage\", planks as in the German \"standerbohlenbau\", timbers as in \"standerblockbau\", or rarely cob without any wooden support. The wall surfaces on the interior were often “ceiled” with wainscoting and plastered for warmth and appearance.\n\nBrick infill sometimes called nogging became the standard infill after the manufacturing of bricks made them more available and less expensive. Half-timbered walls may be covered by siding materials including plaster, weatherboarding, tiles, or slate shingles.\n\nThe infill may be covered by other materials, including weatherboarding or tiles. or left exposed. When left exposed, both the framing and infill were sometimes done in a decorative manner. Germany is famous for its decorative half-timbering and the figures sometimes have names and meanings. The decorative manner of half-timbering is promoted in Germany by the German Timber-Frame Road, several planned routes people can drive to see notable examples of \"Fachwerk\" buildings.\n\nGallery of infill types:\nGallery of some named figures and decorations:\nThe collection of elements in half timbering are sometimes given specific names:\nThe term half-timbering is not as old as the German name \"Fachwerk\" or the French name \"colombage\", but it is the standard English name for this style. One of the first people to publish the term \"half-timbered\" was Mary Martha Sherwood (1775–1851), who employed it in her book, \"The Lady of the Manor\", published in several volumes from 1823 to 1829. She uses the term picturesquely: \"...passing through a gate in a quickset hedge, we arrived at the porch of an old half-timbered cottage, where an aged man and woman received us.\" By 1842, half-timbered had found its way into \"The Encyclopedia of Architecture\" by Joseph Gwilt (1784–1863). This juxtaposition of exposed timbered beams and infilled spaces created the distinctive \"half-timbered\", or occasionally termed, \"Tudor\" style, or \"black-and-white\".\n\nThe most ancient known half-timbered building is called the House of \"opus craticum\". It was buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD in Herculaneum, Italy. \"Opus craticum\" was mentioned by Vitruvius in his books on architecture as a timber frame with wattlework infill. However, the same term is used to describe timber frames with an infill of stone rubble laid in mortar the Romans called \"opus incertum\".\n\nA less common meaning of the term \"half-timbered\" is found in the fourth edition of John Henry Parker's \"Classic Dictionary of Architecture\" (1873) which distinguishes full-timbered houses from half-timbered, with half-timber houses having a ground floor in stone or logs such as the Kluge House which was a log cabin with a timber-framed second floor.\n\nTraditional timber framing is the method of creating framed structures of heavy timber jointed together with various joints, commonly and originally with lap jointing, and then later pegged mortise and tenon joints. Diagonal bracing is used to prevent \"racking\", or movement of structural vertical beams or posts.\n\nOriginally, German (and other) master carpenters would peg the joints with allowance of about an inch (25 mm), enough room for the wood to move as it 'seasoned', then cut the pegs, and drive the beam home fully into its socket.\n\nTo cope with variable sizes and shapes of hewn (by adze or axe) and sawn timbers, two main carpentry methods were employed: scribe carpentry and square rule carpentry.\n\nScribing or coping was used throughout Europe, especially from the 12th century to the 19th century, and subsequently imported to North America, where it was common into the early 19th century. In a scribe frame, timber sockets are fashioned or \"tailor-made\" to fit their corresponding timbers; thus, each timber piece must be numbered (or \"scribed\").\n\nSquare-rule carpentry was developed in New England in the 18th century. It used housed joints in main timbers to allow for interchangeable braces and girts. Today, standardized timber sizing means that timber framing can be incorporated into mass-production methods as per the joinery industry, especially where timber is cut by precision computer numerical control machinery.\n\nA jetty is an upper floor which sometimes historically used a structural horizontal beam, supported on cantilevers, called a bressummer or 'jetty bressummer' to bear the weight of the new wall, projecting outward from the preceding floor or storey.\n\nIn the city of York in the United Kingdom, the famous street known as The Shambles exemplifies this, where jettied houses seem to almost touch above the street.\n\nHistorically, the timbers would have been hewn square using a felling axe and then surface-finished with a broadaxe. If required, smaller timbers were ripsawn from the hewn baulks using pitsaws or frame saws. Today, timbers are more commonly bandsawn, and the timbers may sometimes be machine-planed on all four sides.\n\nThe vertical timbers include:\n\nThe horizontal timbers include:\n\nWhen jettying, horizontal elements can include:\n\nThe sloping timbers include:\n\nThere were two different systems of the position of posts and studs:\n\nRidge-post framing is a structurally simple and ancient post and lintel framing where the posts extend all the way to the ridge beams. Germans call this \"\" or \"Hochstud\".\n\nIn the United States and Canada, timber-frame construction has been revived since the 1970s, and is now experiencing a thriving renaissance of the ancient skills. This is largely due to such practitioners as Steve Chappell, Jack Sobon, and Tedd Benson, who studied old plans and techniques and revived a long-neglected technique. Once a handcrafted skill passed down, timber-frame construction has now been modernized with the help of modern industrial tools such as CNC machines.These machines and mass-production techniques have assisted growth and made for more affordable frames and shorter lead-times for projects.\n\nTimber-framed structures differ from conventional wood-framed buildings in several ways. Timber framing uses fewer, larger wooden members, commonly timbers in the range of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in), while common wood framing uses many more timbers with dimensions usually in the 5- to 25-cm (2- to 10-in) range. The methods of fastening the frame members also differ. In conventional framing, the members are joined using nails or other mechanical fasteners, whereas timber framing uses the traditional mortise and tenon or more complex joints that are usually fastened using only wooden pegs. Modern complex structures and timber trusses often incorporate steel joinery such as gusset plates, for both structural and architectural purposes.\n\nRecently, it has become common practice to enclose the timber structure entirely in manufactured panels such as structural insulated panels (SIPs). Although the timbers can only be seen from inside the building when so enclosed, construction is less complex and insulation is greater than in traditional timber building. SIPs are \"an insulating foam core sandwiched between two structural facings, typically oriented strand board\" according to the Structural Insulated Panel Association. SIPs reduce dependency on bracing and auxiliary members, because the panels span considerable distances and add rigidity to the basic timber frame.\n\nAn alternate construction method is with concrete flooring with extensive use of glass. This allows a very solid construction combined with open architecture. Some firms have specialized in industrial prefabrication of such residential and light commercial structures such as Huf Haus as low-energy houses or – dependent on location – zero-energy buildings.\n\nStraw-bale construction is another alternative where straw bales are stacked for nonload-bearing infill with various finishes applied to the interior and exterior such as stucco and plaster. This appeals to the traditionalist and the environmentalist as this is using \"found\" materials to build.\n\nMudbricks also called adobe are sometimes used to fill in timber-frame structures. They can be made on site and offer exceptional fire resistance. Such buildings must be designed to accommodate the poor thermal insulating properties of mudbrick, however, and usually have deep eaves or a veranda on four sides for weather protection.\n\nThe techniques used in timber framing date back to Neolithic times, and have been used in many parts of the world during various periods such as ancient Japan, continental Europe, and Neolithic Denmark, England, France, Germany, Spain, parts of the Roman Empire, and Scotland. The timber-framing technique has historically been popular in climate zones which favour deciduous hardwood trees, such as oak. Its most northernmost areas are Baltic countries and southern Sweden. Timber framing is rare in Russia, Finland, northern Sweden, and Norway, where tall and straight lumber, such as pine and spruce, is readily available and log houses were favored, instead.\n\nHalf-timbered construction in the Northern European vernacular building style is characteristic of medieval and early modern Denmark, England, Germany, and parts of France and Switzerland, where timber was in good supply yet stone and associated skills to dress the stonework were in short supply. In half-timbered construction, timbers that were riven (split) in half provided the complete skeletal framing of the building.\n\nEurope is full of timber-framed structures dating back hundreds of years, including manors, castles, homes, and inns, whose architecture and techniques of construction have evolved over the centuries. In Asia, timber-framed structures are found, many of them temples that have stood for centuries.\n\nSome Roman carpentry preserved in anoxic layers of clay at Romano-British villa sites demonstrate that sophisticated Roman carpentry had all the necessary techniques for this construction. The earliest surviving (French) half-timbered buildings date from the 12th century.\n\nImportant resources for the study and appreciation of historic building methods are open-air museums.\n\nThe topping out ceremony is a builders' rite, an ancient tradition thought to have originated in Scandinavia by 700 AD. In the U.S., a bough or small tree is attached to the peak of the timber frame after the frame is complete as a celebration. Historically, it was common for the master carpenter to give a speech, make a toast, and then break the glass. In Northern Europe, a wreath made for the occasion is more commonly used rather than a bough. In Japan, the \"ridge raising\" is a religious ceremony called the \"jotoshiki\". In Germany, it is called the \"\".\n\nCarpenters' marks is a general term for markings left on the timbers of wooden buildings during construction.\n\nMany historic hand tools used by timber framers for thousands of years have similarities, but vary in shape. Electrically powered tools first became available in the 1920s in the U.S. and continue to evolve. See the list of timber framing tools for basic descriptions and images of unusual tools (The list is incomplete at this time).\n\nSome of the earliest known timber houses in Europe have been found in Great Britain, dating to Neolithic times; Balbridie and Fengate are some of the rare examples of these constructions.\n\nMolded plaster ornamentation, pargetting further enriched some English Tudor architecture houses. Half-timbering is characteristic of English vernacular architecture in East Anglia, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Cheshire, where one of the most elaborate surviving English examples of half-timbered construction is Little Moreton Hall.\n\nIn South Yorkshire, the oldest timber house in Sheffield, the \"Bishops' House\" (c. 1500), shows traditional half-timbered construction.\n\nIn the Weald of Kent and Sussex, the half-timbered structure of the Wealden hall house, consisted of an open hall with bays on either side and often jettied upper floors.\n\nHalf-timbered construction traveled with British colonists to North America in the early 17th century but was soon abandoned in New England and the mid-Atlantic colonies for clapboard facings (an East Anglia tradition). The original English colonial settlements, such as Plymouth, Massachusetts and Jamestown, Virginia had timber-framed buildings, rather than the log cabins often associated with the American frontier. Living history programs demonstrating the building technique are available at both these locations.\n\nMany of the surviving streets lined with almost-touching houses are known as The Shambles, and are very popular tourist attractions.\n\n\"For Timber-framed houses in Wales see:\" Architecture of Wales\n\nHistoric timber frame construction in England (and the rest of the United Kingdom) showed regional variation which has been divided into the \"eastern school\", the \"western school\", and the \"northern school\", although the characteristic types of framing in these schools can be found in the other regions (except the northern school). A characteristic of the eastern school is close studding which is a half-timbering style of many studs spaced about the width of the studs apart (for example six inch studs spaced six inches apart) until the middle of the 16th century and sometimes wider spacing after that time. Close studding was an elite style found mostly on expensive buildings. A principal style of the western school is the use of square panels of roughly equal size and decorative framing utilizing many shapes such as lozenges, stars, crosses, quatrefoils, , and many other shapes. The northern school sometimes used posts which landed on the foundation rather than on a sill beam, the sill joining to the sides of the posts and called an interrupted sill. Another northern style was to use close studding but in a herring-bone or chevron pattern.\n\nAs houses were modified to cope with changing demands there sometimes were a combination of styles within a single timber frame construction. The major types of historic framing in England are 'cruck frame', box frame, and aisled construction. From the box frame, more complex framed buildings such as the Wealden House and Jettied house developed.\n\nThe cruck frame design is among the earliest, and was in use by the early 13th century, with its use continuing to the present day, although rarely after the 18th century. Since the 18th century however, many existing cruck structures have been modified, with the original cruck framework becoming hidden. Aisled barns are of two or three aisled types, the oldest surviving aisled barn being the barley barn at Cressing Temple dated to 1205–35.\n\nJettying was introduced in the 13th century and continued to be used through the 16th century.\n\nGenerally speaking, the size of timbers used in construction, and the quality of the workmanship reflect the wealth and status of their owners. Small cottages often used quite small cross-section timbers which would have been deemed unsuitable by others. Some of these small cottages also have a very 'home-made' - even temporary - appearance. Many such example can be found in the English shires. Equally, some relatively small buildings can be seen to incorporate substantial timbers and excellent craftsmanship, reflecting the relative wealth and status of their original owners. Important resources for the study of historic building methods in the UK are open-air museums.\n\nElaborately half-timbered houses of the 13th through 18th centuries still remain in Bourges, Troyes, Rouen, Thiers, Dinan, Rennes, and many other cities, except in Provence and Corsica. Timber framing in French is known colloquially as \"pan de bois\" and half-timbering as \"colombage\". Alsace is the region with the most timbered houses in France. But most of these were built when Alsace was part of Germany. The German architecture is spread all over Alsace and old signs in the German language can still be found in front of the houses. \n\nThe \"Normandy tradition\" features two techniques: frameworks were built of four evenly spaced regularly hewn timbers set into the ground (\"poteau en terre\") or into a continuous wooden sill (\"poteau de sole\") and mortised at the top into the plate. The openings were filled with many materials including mud and straw, wattle and daub, or horsehair and gypsum.\n\nGermany has several styles of timber framing, but probably the greatest number of half-timbered buildings in the world are to be found in Germany and in Alsace (France). There are many small towns which escaped both war damage and modernisation and consist mainly, or even entirely, of half-timbered houses.\n\nThe German Timber-Frame Road (\"Deutsche Fachwerkstraße\") is a tourist route that connects towns with remarkable \"fachwerk\". It is more than long, crossing Germany through the states of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Hesse, Thuringia, Bavaria, and Baden-Württemberg.\n\nSome of the more prominent towns (among many) include: Quedlinburg, a UNESCO-listed town, which has over 1200 half-timbered houses spanning five centuries; Goslar, another UNESCO-listed town; Hanau-Steinheim (home of the Brothers Grimm); Bad Urach; Eppingen (\"Romance city\" with a half-timbered church dating from 1320); Mosbach; Vaihingen an der Enz and nearby UNESCO-listed Maulbronn Abbey; Schorndorf (birthplace of Gottlieb Daimler); Calw; Celle; and Biberach an der Riß with both the largest medieval complex, the \"Holy Spirit Hospital\" and one of Southern Germany's oldest buildings, now the Braith-Mali-Museum, dated to 1318.\n\nGerman \"fachwerk\" building styles are extremely varied with a huge number of carpentry techniques which are highly regionalized. German planning laws for the preservation of buildings and regional architecture preservation dictate that a half-timbered house must be authentic to regional or even city-specific designs before being accepted.\n\nA brief overview of styles follows, as a full inclusion of all styles is impossible.\n\nIn general the northern states have \"fachwerk\" very similar to that of the nearby Netherlands and England while the more southerly states (most notably Bavaria and Switzerland) have more decoration using timber because of greater forest reserves in those areas. During the 19th century, a form of decorative timber-framing called \"bundwerk\" became popular in Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol.\n\nThe German \"fachwerkhaus\" usually has a foundation of stone, or sometimes brick, perhaps up to several feet (a couple of metres) high, which the timber framework is mortised into or, more rarely, supports an irregular wooden sill.\n\nThe three main forms may be divided geographically:\n\nThe most characteristic feature is the spacing between the posts and the high placement of windows. Panels are enclosed by a sill, posts, and a plate, and are crossed by two rails between which the windows are placed—like \"two eyes peering out\".\n\nIn addition there is a myriad of regional scrollwork and fretwork designs of the non-loadbearing large timbers (braces) peculiar to particularly wealthy towns or cities.\n\nA unique type of timber-frame house can be found in the region where the borders of Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland meet - it is called the Upper Lusatian house (Umgebindehaus, translates as \"round-framed house\"). This type has a timber frame surrounding a log structure on part of the ground floor.\n\nSeveral half-timbered houses can be found in Northern Italy, especially in Piedmont, Lombardy, in the city of Bologna, in Sardinia in the Barbagia region and in the Iglesiente mining region.\n\nThe Slavic tradition of vernacular architecture is rather log building. Most half-timbered houses have been built in regions that once belonged to Germany, had a lot of German immigrants or significant German cultural influence. As these regions were at some point parts of Prussia, half-timbered walls are called \"mur pruski\". The Slovincians, an autochthone Slavic group in the Prussian province of Pomerania also built half-timbered houses. A distinctive type of house associated with mostly Mennonite immigrant groups from Frisia and the Netherlands, known as the Olędrzy, is called an arcade house (\"dom podcieniowy\").\n\nThe Umgebindehaus rural housing tradition of south Saxony (Germany) is also found in the neighboring areas of Poland (the Silesian region) and the north of Czech Republic.\n\nAnother world-class type of wooden building Poland shares with some neighboring countries are its wooden church buildings.\n\nThe Spanish generally follow the Mediterranean forms of architecture with stone walls and shallow roof pitch. Timber framing is often of the post and lintel style. Castile and León and the Basque Country have the most representative examples of the use of timber framing in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nMost traditional Basque buildings with half-timbering elements are detached farm houses (in Basque: baserriak). Their upper floors were built with jettied box frames in close studding. In the oldest farmsteads and, if existing, in the third floor the walls were sometimes covered with vertical weatherboards. Big holes were left in the gable of the main façade for ventilation. The wooden beams were painted over, mostly in dark red. The vacancies were filled in with wattle and daub or rubble laid in a clay mortar and then plastered over with white chalk or nogged with bricks. Although the entire supporting structure is made of wood, the timbering is only visible on the main façade, which is generally oriented to the southeast.\n\nAlthough the typical Basque house is now mostly associated with half-timbering, the outer walls and the fire-walls were built in masonry (rubble stone, bricks or, ideally, ashlars) whenever it could be afforded. Timber was a sign of poverty. Oak-wood was cheaper than masonry: that is why, when the money was running out, the upper floor walls were mostly built timbered. Extant baserriak with half-timbered upper-floor façades were built from the 15th to 19th centuries and are found in all Basque regions with oceanic climate, except in Zuberoa (Soule), but are concentrated in Lapurdi (Labourd).\n\nSome medieval Basque tower houses (dorretxeak) feature an overhanged upper floor in half-timbering.\n\nTo a lesser extent timbered houses are also found in villages and towns as row houses, as the photo from the Uztaritz village shows.\n\nCurrently, it has again become popular to build houses resembling old Basque farmsteads, with more or less respect for the principles of traditional half-timbered building.\n\nSwitzerland has many styles of timber framing which overlap with its neighboring countries.\n\nNowadays, timber framing is primarily found in the provinces of Limburg, Liège, and Luxemburg. In urban areas, the ground floor was formerly built in stone and the upper floors in timber framing. Also, as timber framing was seen as a cheaper way of building, often the visible structures of noble houses were in stone and bricks, and the invisible or lateral walls in timber framing. The open-air museums of Bokrijk and Saint-Hubert (Fourneau Saint-Michel) show many examples of Belgian timber framing. Many post-and-beam houses can be found in cities and villages, but, unlike France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, there are few fully timber framed cityscapes.\n\nThe Swedish mostly built log houses but they do have traditions of several types of timber framing: Some of the following links are written in Swedish. Most of the half-timbered houses in Sweden were built during the Danish time and are located in what until 1658 used to be Danish territory in southern Sweden, primarily in the province Skåne and secondarily in Blekinge and Halland. In Swedish half-timber is known as \"korsvirke\".\n\nNorway has at least two significant types of timber framed structures: 1) The stave church and 2) grindverk. The term \"stave\" (= post or pole) indicates that a \"stave church\" essentially means a framed church, a distinction made in a region where log building is common. All but one surviving stave churches are in Norway, one in Sweden. Replicas of stave churches and other Norwegian building types have been reproduced elsewhere, e.g. at the Scandinavian Heritage Park in North Dakota, United States.\n\n\"Grindverk\" translates as \"trestle\" construction, consisting of a series of transversal frames of two posts and a connecting beam, supporting two parallel wall plates bearing the rafters. Unlike other types of timber framing in Europe, the trestle frame construction uses no mortise and tenon joints. Archaeological excavations have uncovered similar wooden joints from more than 3,000 years ago, suggesting that this type of framing is an ancient unbroken tradition. Grindverk buildings are only found on part of the western coast of Norway, and most of them are boathouses and barns. There is currently no article in English Wikipedia about grindverk framing, but see Norwegian Wikipedia:\n\nThe Netherlands is often overlooked for its timbered houses, yet many exist, including windmills. It was in North Holland where the import of cheaper timber, combined with the Dutch innovation of windmill-powered sawmills, allowed economically viable widespread use of protective wood covering over framework. In the late 17th century the Dutch introduced vertical cladding also known in Eastern England as clasp board and in western England as weatherboard, then as more wood was available more cheaply, horizontal cladding in the 17th century. Perhaps owing to economic considerations, vertical cladding returned to fashion. Dutch wall framing is virtually always built in bents and the three basic types of roof framing are the rafter roof, purlin roof, and ridge-post roof.\n\nMost \"haft-timbered\" houses existing in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas were built by German settlers. Old Salem North Carolina has fine examples of German fachwerk buildings. Many are still present in Colonia Tovar (Venezuela), Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), where Germans settled. Later, they chose more suitable building materials for local conditions (most likely because of the great problem of tropical termites.)\n\nIn the historical region of North America known as New France, colombage pierroté, also called \"maçonnerie entre poteaux\", half-timbered construction with the infill between the posts and studs of stone rubble and lime plaster or bousillage and simply called \"colombage\" in France. Colombage was used from the earliest settlement until the 18th century but was known as \"bousillage entre poteaus sur solle\" in Lower Louisiana. The style had its origins in Normandy, and was brought to Canada by very early Norman settlers. The Men's House at Lower Fort Garry is a good example. The exterior walls of such buildings were often covered over with clapboards to protect the infill from erosion. Naturally, this required frequent maintenance, and the style was abandoned as a building method in the 18th century in Québec. For the same reasons, half-timbering in New England, which was originally employed by the English settlers, fell out of favour soon after the colonies had become established.\n\nOther variations of half-timbering are \"colombage à teurques\" (torchis), straw coated with mud and hung over horizontal staves (or otherwise held in place), colombage an eclisses, and colombage a lattes.\n\nPoteaux-en-terre (posts in ground) is a type of timber framing with the many vertical posts or studs buried in the ground called post in ground or \"earthfast\" construction. The tops of the posts are joined to a beam and the spaces between are filled in with natural materials called bousillage or pierrotage.\n\nPoteaux-sur-sol (posts on a sill) is a general term for any kind of framing on a sill. However, sometimes it specifically refers to \"vertical log construction\" like poteaux-en-terre placed on sills with the spaces between the timbers infilled.\n\nPiece-sur-piece also known as Post-and-plank style or \"corner post construction\" (and many other names) in which wood is used both for the frame and horizontal infill; for this reason it may be incorrect to call it \"half-timbering\". It is sometimes a blend of framing and log building with two styles: the horizontal pieces fit into groves in the posts and can slide up and down or the horizontal pieces fit into individual mortises in the posts and are pegged and the gaps between the pieces chinked (filled in with stones or chips of wood covered with mud or moss briefly discussed in Log cabin.)\n\nThis technique of a timber frame walls filled in with horizontal planks or logs proved better suited to the harsh climates of Québec and Acadia, which at the same time had abundant wood. It became very popular throughout New France, as far afield as southern Louisiana. The Hudson's Bay Company used this technique for many of its trading posts, and this style of framing becoming known as Hudson Bay style or Hudson Bay corners. Also used by the Red River Colony this style also became known as \"Red River Framing\". “The support of horizontal timbers by corner posts is an old form of construction in Europe. It was apparently carried across much of the continent from Silesia by the Lausitz urnfield culture in the late Bronze Age.” Similar building techniques are apparently not found in France but exist in Germany and Switzerland known as Bohlenstanderbau when planks are used or blockstanderbau when beams are used as the infill. In Sweden known as sleppvegg or skiftesverk and in Denmark as bulhus.\n\nA particularly interesting example in the U.S. is the Golden Plough Tavern (c. 1741), York, York County, PA, which has the ground level of corner-post construction with the second floor of fachwerk (half timbered) and was built for a German with other Germanic features.\n\nSettlers in New France also built horizontal log, brick, and stone buildings.\n\nCharacteristics of traditional timber framing in the parts of the U.S. formerly known as New Netherland are H-framing also known as dropped-tie framing in the U.S. and the similar anchor beam framing as found in the New World Dutch barn.\n\nSome time periods/regions within New England contain certain framing elements such as common purlin roofs, five sided ridge beams, plank-frame construction and plank-wall construction. The English barn always contains an \"English tying joint\" and the later New England style barn were built using bents.\n\nJapanese timber framing is believed to be descended from Chinese framing (see Ancient Chinese wooden architecture). Asian framing is significantly different from western framing, with its predominant use of post and lintel framing and an almost complete lack of diagonal bracing.\n\nWhen half-timbering regained popularity in Britain after 1860 in the various revival styles, such as the Queen Anne style houses by Richard Norman Shaw and others, it was often used to evoke a \"Tudor\" atmosphere (\"see Tudorbethan\"), though in Tudor times half-timbering had begun to look rustic and was increasingly limited to village houses (\"illustration, above left\").\n\nIn 1912, Allen W. Jackson published \"The Half-Timber House: Its Origin, Design, Modern Plan, and Construction,\" and rambling half-timbered beach houses appeared on dune-front properties in Rhode Island or under palm-lined drives of Beverly Hills. During the 1920s increasingly minimal gestures towards some half-timbering in commercial speculative house-building saw the fashion diminish.\n\nIn the revival styles, such as Tudorbethan (Mock Tudor), the half-timbered appearance is superimposed on the brickwork or other material as an outside decorative façade rather than forming the main frame that supports the structure.\n\nThe style was used in many of the homes built in Lake Mohawk, New Jersey as well as all of the clubhouse, shops, and marina.\n\nFor information about \"roundwood framing\" see the book Roundwood Timber Framing:Building Naturally Using Local Resources by Ben Law (East Meon, Hampshire: Permanent Publications; 2010. )\n\nThe use of timber framing in buildings offers various aesthetic and structural benefits, as the timber frame lends itself to open plan designs and allows for complete enclosure in effective insulation for energy efficiency. In modern construction, a timber-frame structure offers many benefits:\n\nIn North America, heavy timber construction is classified Building Code Type IV: a special class reserved for timber framing which recognizes the inherent fire resistance of large timber and its ability to retain structural capacity in fire situations. In many cases this classification can eliminate the need and expense of fire sprinklers in public buildings.\n\nIn terms of the traditional half-timber or \"fachwerkhaus\" there are maybe more disadvantages than advantages today. Such houses are notoriously expensive to maintain let alone renovate and restore, most commonly owing to local regulations that do not allow divergence from the original, modification or incorporation of modern materials.\nAdditionally, in such nations as Germany, where energy efficiency is highly regulated, the renovated building may be required to meet modern energy efficiencies, if it is to be used as a residential or commercial structure (museums and significant historic buildings have no semi-permanent habitade exempt). Many framework houses of significance are treated merely to preserve, rather than render inhabitable — most especially as the required heavy insecticidal fumigation is highly poisonous.\n\nIn some cases, it is more economical to build anew using authentic techniques and correct period materials than restore. One major problem with older structures is the phenomenon known as \"mechano-sorptive creep\" or slanting: where wood beams absorb moisture whilst under compression or tension strains and deform, shift position or both. This is a major structural issue as the house may deviate several degrees from perpendicular to its foundations (in the x-axis, y-axis, and even z-axis) and thus be unsafe and unstable or so out of square it is extremely costly to remedy.\n\nA summary of problems with \"Fachwerkhäuser\" or half-timbered houses includes the following, though many can be avoided by thoughtful design and application of suitable paints and surface treatments and routine maintenance. Often, though when dealing with a structure of a century or more old, it is too late.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32321", "title": "Universal Networking Language", "text": "Universal Networking Language\n\nUniversal Networking Language (UNL) is a declarative formal language specifically designed to represent semantic data extracted from natural language texts. It can be used as a pivot language in interlingual machine translation systems or as a knowledge representation language in information retrieval applications. \n\nUNL is designed to establish a simple foundation for representing the most central aspects of information and meaning in a machine- and human-language-independent form. As a language-independent formalism, UNL aims to code, store, disseminate and retrieve information independently of the original language in which it was expressed. In this sense, UNL seeks to provide tools for overcoming the language barrier in a systematic way.\n\nAt first glance, UNL seems to be a kind of interlingua, into which source texts are converted before being translated into target languages. It can, in fact, be used for this purpose, and very efficiently, too. However, its real strength is knowledge representation and its primary objective is to provide an infrastructure for handling knowledge that already exists or can exist in any given language.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to note that at present it would be foolish to claim to represent the “full” meaning of any word, sentence, or text for any language. Subtleties of intention and interpretation make the “full meaning,” however we might conceive it, too variable and subjective for any systematic treatment. Thus UNL avoids the pitfalls of trying to represent the “full meaning” of sentences or texts, targeting instead the “core” or “consensual” meaning most often attributed to them. In this sense, much of the subtlety of poetry, metaphor, figurative language, innuendo, and other complex, indirect communicative behaviors is beyond the current scope and goals of UNL. Instead, UNL targets direct communicative behavior and literal meaning as a tangible, concrete basis for most human communication in practical, day-to-day settings.\n\nIn the UNL approach, information conveyed by natural language is represented sentence by sentence as a hypergraph composed of a set of directed binary labeled links (referred to as relations) between nodes or hypernodes (the Universal Words, or simply UWs), which stand for concepts. UWs can also be annotated with attributes representing context information. \n\nAs an example, the English sentence ‘The sky was blue?!’ can be represented in UNL as follows:\n\nIn the example above, \"sky(icl>natural world)\" and \"blue(icl>color)\", which represent individual concepts, are UWs; \"aoj\" (= attribute of an object) is a directed binary semantic relation linking the two UWs; and \"@def\", \"@interrogative\", \"@past\", \"@exclamation\" and \"@entry\" are attributes modifying UWs.\n\nUWs are intended to represent universal concepts, but are expressed in English words or in any other natural language in order to be humanly readable. They consist of a \"headword\" (the UW root) and a \"constraint list\" (the UW suffix between parentheses), where the constraints are used to disambiguate the general concept conveyed by the headword. The set of UWs is organized in the UNL Ontology, in which high-level concepts are related to lower-level ones through the relations \"icl\" (= is a kind of), \"iof\" (= is an instance of) and \"equ\" (= is equal to). \n\nRelations are intended to represent semantic links between words in every existing language. They can be ontological (such as \"icl\" and \"iof,\" referred to above), logical (such as \"and\" and \"or\"), and thematic (such as \"agt\" = agent, \"ins\" = instrument, \"tim\" = time, \"plc\" = place, etc.). There are currently 46 relations in the UNL Specs. They jointly define the UNL syntax.\n\nAttributes represent information that cannot be conveyed by UWs and relations. Normally, they represent information concerning time (\"@past\", \"@future\", etc.), reference (\"@def\", \"@indef\", etc.), modality (\"@can\", \"@must\", etc.), focus (\"@topic\", \"@focus\", etc.), and so on.\n\nWithin the UNL Program, the process of representing natural language sentences in UNL graphs is called UNLization, and the process of generating natural language sentences out of UNL graphs is called NLization. UNLization, which involves natural language analysis and understanding, is intended to be carried out semi-automatically (i.e., by humans with computer aids); and NLization is intended to be carried out fully automatically.\n\nThe UNL Programme started in 1996, as an initiative of the Institute of Advanced Studies of the United Nations University in Tokyo, Japan. In January 2001, the United Nations University set up an autonomous organization, the UNDL Foundation, to be responsible for the development and management of the UNL Programme. The Foundation, a non-profit international organisation, has an independent identity from the United Nations University, although it has special links with the UN. It inherited from the UNU/IAS the mandate of implementing the UNL Programme so that it can fulfil its mission.\n\nThe Programme has already crossed important milestones. The overall architecture of the UNL System has been developed with a set of basic software and tools necessary for its functioning. These are being tested and improved. A vast amount of linguistic resources from the various native languages already under development, as well as from the UNL expression, has been accumulated in the last few years. Moreover, the technical infrastructure for expanding these resources is already in place, thus facilitating the participation of many more languages in the UNL system from now on. A growing number of scientific papers and academic dissertations on the UNL are being published every year. \n\nThe most visible accomplishment so far is the recognition by the Patent Co-operation Treaty (PCT) of the innovative character and industrial applicability of the UNL, which was obtained in May 2002 through the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). Acquiring the patents (US patents 6,704,700 and 7,107,206) for the UNL is a completely novel achievement within the United Nations.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2215518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2215518", "title": "Vorort", "text": "Vorort\n\n'Vorort' (plural: \"Vororte\") is a German term that could be considered roughly equivalent to a suburb. Vororte usually have their own business centre. They are the remainders of formerly separate neighbour towns, or have been founded as satellite towns. The term is contrasted with \"Vorstadt\", which describes a more densely populated area grown at the outline of a city centre.\n\nIn Swiss history, \"Vorort\" referred to the temporary \"presidency\" of a canton or the cantonal capital. During the Old Swiss Confederacy, the canton or city that convened the Tagsatzung and chaired it was called the \"Vorort\". In the 15th century, the city of Zürich became the \"de facto\" Vorort of the Confederacy. Since the Reformation in Switzerland, Lucerne became the Vorort of the Catholic cantons. With the 1798 establishment of the Helvetic Republic the Vororte were abolished and instead Aarau was made capital city, then Lucerne, then Bern. After the Act of Mediation, the \"Vorort of Switzerland\" would rotate each year between the capital of Aarau and the cities of Zürich, Bern, Lucerne, Fribourg, Solothurn and Basel. In 1815, the choice of Vororte was restricted to Zürich, Bern and Lucerne, who in turn served as biennial seat of government until 1847. In 1848, Bern became the permanent seat of the Swiss Federal Government and thus the \"de facto\" capital of Switzerland.\n\nIn Vienna, the historical terms \"Vorstädte\" and \"Vororte\" have very specific meanings. The \"Vorstädte\" were located outside the city walls, but within the \"Linienwall\", a second ring of fortifications outside the city. The city walls were located in the place of the modern Ringstraße, while the \"Linienwall\" has been removed to give way to the \"Gürtel\" (both being rings of streets around the central city). All of the historical municipalities were merged into Vienna during the late 19th century. The former \"Vororte\", which have in large parts become as urban as the \"Vorstädte\", now make up Vienna's so-called outer districts (10th to 19th and 21st to 23rd district).\n"}
