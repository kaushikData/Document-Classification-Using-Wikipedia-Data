{"id": "599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=599", "title": "Afroasiatic languages", "text": "Afroasiatic languages\n\nAfroasiatic (Afro-Asiatic), also known as Afrasian and in older sources as Hamito-Semitic (Chamito-Semitic) or Semito-Hamitic, is a large language family of about 300 languages. It includes languages spoken predominantly in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel.\n\nAfroasiatic languages have over 495 million native speakers, the fourth largest number of any language family (after Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan and Niger–Congo). The phylum has six branches: Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, Egyptian, Omotic and Semitic. \n\nBy far the most widely spoken Afroasiatic language or dialect continuum is Arabic. A de facto group of distinct language varieties within the Semitic branch, the languages that evolved from Proto-Arabic have around 313 million native speakers, concentrated primarily in West Asia and North Africa.\n\nOther widely spoken Afroasiatic languages include:\nIn addition to languages spoken today, Afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages, such as Ancient Egyptian, which forms a distinct branch of the family, and Akkadian, Biblical Hebrew and Old Aramaic, all of which are from the Semitic branch. \n\nThe original homeland of the Afroasiatic family, and when the parent language (i.e. Proto-Afroasiatic) was spoken, are yet to be agreed upon by historical linguists. Proposed locations include North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Eastern Sahara and the Levant (see below).\n\nDuring the early 1800s, linguists grouped the Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian languages within a \"Hamitic\" phylum, in acknowledgement of these languages' genetic relation with each other and with those in the Semitic phylum. The terms \"Hamitic\" and \"Semitic\" were etymologically derived from the Book of Genesis, which describes various Biblical tribes descended from Ham and Shem, two sons of Noah. By the 1860s, the main constituent elements within the broader Afroasiatic family had been worked out.\n\nFriedrich Müller introduced the name \"Hamito-Semitic\" for the entire family in his \"Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft\" (1876). Maurice Delafosse (1914) later coined the term \"Afroasiatic\" (often now spelled \"Afro-Asiatic\"). However, it did not come into general use until Joseph Greenberg (1950) formally proposed its adoption. In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic spanned the continents of both Africa and Asia.\n\nIndividual scholars have also called the family \"Erythraean\" (Tucker 1966) and \"Lisramic\" (Hodge 1972). In lieu of \"Hamito-Semitic\", the Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term \"Afrasian\", meaning \"half African, half Asiatic\", in reference to the geographic distribution of the family's constituent languages.\n\nThe term \"Hamito-Semitic\" remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries.\n\nScholars generally treat the Afroasiatic language family as including the following branches:\n\nAlthough there is general agreement on these six families, linguists who study Afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement, in particular:\n\nIn the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret in Algeria was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic.\n\nIn the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships. In 1844, Theodor Benfey suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter \"Ethiopic\"). In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.\n\nFriedrich Müller named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his \"Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft\" (\"Outline of Linguistics\"), and defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a \"Hamitic\" group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group. It was the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius (1810–1884) who restricted Hamitic to the non-Semitic languages in Africa, which are characterized by a grammatical gender system. This \"Hamitic language group\" was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient Egyptian language, the Berber languages, the Cushitic languages, the Beja language, and the Chadic languages. Unlike Müller, Lepsius considered that Hausa and Nama were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.\n\nIn 1912, Carl Meinhof published \"Die Sprachen der Hamiten\" (\"The Languages of the Hamites\"), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the Fula, Maasai, Bari, Nandi, Sandawe and Hadza languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s. Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that \"speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'.\" However, in the case of the so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a \"fallacious theory of language mixture.\" Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub \"Nilo-Hamitic\" were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.\n\nLeo Reinisch (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. Marcel Cohen (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct \"Hamitic\" subgroup, and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, Joseph Greenberg's 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of \"Hamitic\" as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate \"Nilo-Hamitic\" language category in particular, Greenberg was \"returning to a view widely held a half century earlier.\" He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings. He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.\n\nGreenberg's model was fully developed in his book \"The Languages of Africa\" (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably Nilo-Saharan. Following Isaac Schapera and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the Khoekhoe language as a member of the Khoisan languages, a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of click sounds. To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian Hadza and Sandawe, though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages consider them to be linguistic isolates. Despite this, Greenberg's classification remains a starting point for modern work of many languages spoken in Africa, and the Hamitic category (and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic) has no part in this.\n\nSince the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages (Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian) have not been shown to form an exclusive (monophyletic) phylogenetic unit of their own, separate from other Afroasiatic languages, linguists no longer use the term in this sense. Each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family.\n\nIn 1969, Harold Fleming proposed that what had previously been known as Western Cushitic is an independent branch of Afroasiatic, suggesting for it the new name Omotic. This proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance.\n\nSeveral scholars, including Harold Fleming and Robert Hetzron, have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic.\n\n\"Glottolog\" does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of Omotic has been established, nor that of Ongota or the unclassified Kujarge. It therefore splits off the following groups as small families: South Omotic, Mao, Dizoid, Gonga–Gimojan (North Omotic apart from the preceding), Ongota, Kujarge.\n\nLittle agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of Afroasiatic: Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic. However, Christopher Ehret (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.\n\nOtherwise:\n\nAfroasiatic is one of the four major language families spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book \"The Languages of Africa\" (1963). It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nThere are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:\n\nThe earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an Ancient Egyptian inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago). Symbols on Gerzean (Naqada II) pottery resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from Proto-Afroasiatic (Trombetti 1905: 1–2), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to Igor M. Diakonoff (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 10,000 BC. Christopher Ehret (2002: 35–36) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than those associated with other proto-languages.\n\nThe term Afroasiatic Urheimat (\"Urheimat\" meaning \"original homeland\" in German) refers to the hypothetical place where Proto-Afroasiatic language speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of the Sahel. Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the Sahara pump operating over the last 10,000 years.\n\nThere is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed. The main theories of Urheimat are the Levant, the Eastern Sahara, North Africa and the Horn of Africa.\n\nH. Ekkehard Wolff proposes that Proto-Afroasiatic arose in the Fertile Crescent between 15,000 and 9,000 years BC during the Neolithic revolution, then migrated to Africa around 8,000 BC to develop into the Egyptian, Chadic, Omotic, Cushitic and Berber branches.\n\nWidespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include:\n\nOne of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see the table at the start of this section), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /ʔ t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.\n\nAccording to Ehret (1996), tonal languages appear in the Omotic and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic, as well as in certain Cushitic languages. The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches generally do not use tones phonemically.\n\nThe following are some examples of Afroasiatic cognates, including ten pronouns, three nouns, and three verbs.\n\nThere are two etymological dictionaries of Afroasiatic, one by Christopher Ehret, and one by Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova. The two dictionaries disagree on almost everything. The following table contains the thirty roots or so (out of thousands) that represent a fragile consensus of present research:\n\nSome of the main sources for Afroasiatic etymologies include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "371133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371133", "title": "Cocacolonization", "text": "Cocacolonization\n\nCocacolonization (alternatively coca-colonization) refers to the globalization of American culture (also referred as to as Americanization) pushed through popular American products such as soft drink maker Coca-Cola. It is a portmanteau of the name of the multinational soft drink maker and \"colonization\": a process of change that happens everywhere the culture of capitalism takes root.\n\nThe term was first documented in 1949 in France, where the French Communist Party strongly opposed the further expansion of Coca-Cola. In 1948, the finance ministry stood against Coke on the grounds that its operation would bring no capital to help with French recovery, and was likely to drain profits back to the parent company in the United States. The French Communist Party also warned that the Coke distribution system would double as an espionage network.\n\nIn World War II and the Cold War, many outside of the United States associated Coca-Cola with American culture. With ties to the culture of the United States, select Europeans rejected attempts to cocacolonize their nations. It represented an invasion of their nationalistic identities. In Europe, Coca-Cola was not just a carbonated refreshment, but bottled America. By the end of the Cold War, American ideals were spread across the world by Coke and in certain cases, to combat Communism.\n\nCocacolonization as a historical concept gained visibility in the European Americanization debate with the 1994 publication of 's book, \"Coca-Colonization and the Cold War: The Cultural Mission of the United States in Austria After the Second World War\". Wagnleitner used cocacolonization to embody the premise of his book: America attempted cultural imperialism by expanding American ideals through the spread of consumer goods such as Coca-Cola and Levi jeans and through cultural symbols like Rock and roll and Marlon Brando's black leather jacket, as well as through the promotion of democracy in Europe.\n\nThe expression is also used in medical literature, to describe the lifestyle changes and the associated increase of incidence of characteristic chronic diseases, e.g. type 2 diabetes.\n\nCocacolonization began at the beginning of World War II and still exists as of 2015. Over time, some countries resisted the American soft drink while others openly accepted it. To all, it represented America and her culture and at a majority of major historical events during the twentieth century, Coke was in attendance.\n\n“Although the brand dates back to the late 1880s, the basic brand proposition - Coca-Cola satisfies, Coca-Cola is a delightful, refreshing beverage - has remained virtually unchanged, as has the brand name and its distinctive logo.” The image of the Coca-Cola continues today: “The brand is seen as traditional, patriotic, friendly, and American.”\n\nWhen war broke out and American troops were sent overseas, the Coca-Cola company vowed that any American in uniform should be able to get a Coke for five cents wherever they were. As a result, the company built bottling stations in the Pacific and on the Western front.\n\nGermans recognized Coke to be a \"Jewish-American\" drink. In response, the Nazi regime only allowed Coke in the country if it displayed a swastika on the bottle, which it did. In the Soviet Union, war hero Marshal Georgi Zhukov loved the drink, but Soviet leader Joseph Stalin viewed it as an American imperialist symbol. As a solution, Coca-Cola developed a clear version of the drink bottled with a white cap and red star to not appear like the well-known American drink.\n\nOn the Pacific front of the war, Coke had a tough time reaching the troops. To address the issue, the company created portable soda fountains that were distributed throughout the islands on the Pacific Ocean. Asian countries experienced Coca-Cola. According to the company, the drink spread throughout the islands because, \"Coke symbolized the American way of life.\"\n\nThroughout the war, Coke dispersed ads for their soda all over the world. The majority of the ads displayed an American soldier drinking a soda with the natives of that country. If the ad was in a country outside of the United States, it was written in the native language of that country. Popular ads had positive images of Americans with Coke in New Zealand, Russia, the Philippines, Newfoundland, Italy, England, and in Poland. According to Coca-Cola, \"From the jungles of the Admiral Islands to the officer clubs in the Riviera,\" Coke and America was there.\n\nThe end of World War II marked widespread cocacolonization of Europe and Asia. In 1947, Coca-Cola bottling operations began in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg; then Switzerland, Italy, and France by 1949. Author Mark Gordon said, \"American ideals were now being pushed on Europeans every time they sipped a bottle of Coke.\" By the early 1950s, there were 63 bottling plants expanding across three continents including the countries of: Egypt, Iceland, Iran, West Africa, and New Guinea. Many US companies benefitted from expansion into Europe, including Coca-Cola. Through these foreign endeavours, the US was able to informally create a business and corporate empire via the expansion of several US companies.\n\nBy the time of the Cold War, Coke met resistance in some countries. Italians kept from indulging in the soda. Austrians recognized the expansion of the company as an attempt to spread American culture and ideals overseas. In France, French communists spread awareness about Coca-Cola. They coined the term cocacolonization because they saw the spread of Coke in their country as an attempt to make it an American colony. When the company attempted to open a bottling plant in the country, French Communists threatened to barricade Paris to keep Coke out. To the French, the company represented Capitalist America.\n\nAt the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of Communism in Germany in November 1989, Coca-Cola handed out sodas.\n\nMedical experts use the term cocacolonization in their medical journals representing the spread of unhealthy American foods overseas.\n\nA significant shift in nutrition has occurred. Developed nations export processed foods that are high in saturated fats to developing nations, causing a change from previous methods of survival such as hunting and gathering.\n\nCocacolonization has been linked to the spike in Type 2 Diabetes , obesity, and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases because of the connection between economic situation and low costs of high fat foods.\n\nDue to an increase in tourism in their area, the Mayan tribe in the Yucatán Peninsula experienced a decline in health because they were introduced to unhealthy American foods. They became increasingly dependent on the foods. Similarly, the Tz'utujill tribe in Guatemala was also introduced to the same food and encountered the same decline in health lead. Worldwide, type 2 diabetes spread and steadily increased over the past 20 years. The explanation for their decline in health: cocacolonization.\n\nAs of 2015, Coca-Cola has been distributed to over 200 countries worldwide. A few of the many countries consist of China, Guatemala, Papua New Guinea, Mexico, Russia, Canada, United Kingdom, Algeria, and Libya. According to the company, \"Coca-Cola is the second-most understood term in the world behind \"okay.\"\n\nCoca-Cola as a product has stretched across international borders to create a brand. “In much political, academic and conversational rhetoric the term Coca-Cola comes to stand, not just for a particular soft drink, but also for the problematic nature of commodities in general. It is a meta-commodity. … It may stand for commodities or capitalism, but equally Imperialism or Americanization.” Cocacolonization as referring to the spread of American culture and/or brands; Coca-Cola is an example of the widespread infrastructure of westernized capitalism and consumerism.\n\nCoca-Cola operates via franchises, therefore for areas to benefit from its production local bottling plants are required. Trinidad obtained the franchise in 1939, so in Trinidad Coke was bottled by the firm of Cannings - which like other older colonial firms was taken over, in Cannings case in 1975.\n\nIn Trinidad sweet drinks are not viewed as luxury items but instead as everyday items of the common man. In relation to Coca-Cola, “the centrality of the black sweet drink to Trinidadian drinking is above all summed up in the notion of a “rum and Coke” as the core alcoholic drink for most people of the island.” Having a common drink that requires the existence of an exact sweet drink emphasizes its hold on the local environment.\n\n\n"}

They have brought with them a Southern Russian dialect of their communities of origin, which over the following decades underwent some changes under the influence of the Canadian English environment and the speech of the Ukrainian settlers in Saskatchewan.\n\nOver several generations, this dialect has been mostly lost, as the modern descendants of the original Doukhobor migrants to Canada are typically native English speakers, and when they do speak Russian, it is typically a fairly standard variety of it.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that the formative period for the speech of the Doukhobors was the first four decades of the 19th century. It was in 1802 that the Doukhobors, as well as the members of Russia's other dissenter Christian groups, were encouraged to migrate to the Molochna River region, around Melitopol near Ukraine's Sea of Azov coast. Over the next 10–20 years, the Doukhobor, Molokan, and other settlers, speaking a variety of mostly Southern Russian dialects arrived to the Molochna from several provinces located, primarily, in what is today eastern Ukraine and south-central Russia. In the settlers' villages an opportunity thus arose for the formation of a certain dialect koiné, based on Southern Russian and Eastern Ukrainian dialects.\n\nStarting in 1841, the Doukhobors (as well as Molokans and certain other dissenters) were resettled from southern Ukraine to Transcaucasia, where they founded a number of villages surrounded by mostly non-Russian speaking neighbors (primarily Azerbaijanis in Elisabethpol Governorate, Armenians in Tiflis Governorate, and likely a mix of both in the later (post-1878) settlements in Kars Oblast). These conditions allowed the dialect to develop in comparative isolation from the \"mainstream\" Russian.\n\nWith the migration of some 7,500 Doukhbors from Transcaucasia to Saskatchewan in 1899, and some smaller latecomer groups (both from Transcaucasia and from places of exile in Siberia and elsewhere), the dialect spoken in the Doukhobor villages of Transcaucasia was brought to the plains of Canada. From that point on it experienced influence from the English language of Canada and, during the years of Doukhobor stay in Saskatchewan, the speech of Doukhobor's Ukrainian neighbors.\n\nA split in the Doukhobor community resulted in a large number of Doukhobors moving from Saskatchewan to south-eastern British Columbia around 1910. Those who moved (the so-called \"Community Doukhobors\" – followers of Peter Verigin's Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood – continued living a communal lifestyle for several more decades, and had a better chance to preserve the Russian language than the \"Independent Doukhobors\", who stayed in Saskatchewan as individual farmers.\n\nBy the 1970s, as most Russia-born members of the community died, English became the first language of the great majority of Canadian Doukhobors. Their English speech is not noticeably different from that of other English-speaking Canadians of their provinces. Russian still remains in use, at least for religious use among those who do practise the Doukhobor religion. However, practising Doukhobors are a shrinking group, with only some 3,800 persons in Canada identifying themselves as members of the Doukhobor religion as of the Canada 2001 Census.\n\nAccording to Gunter Schaarschmidt's survey article (\"Four norms...\"), research into the Russian spoken by Canada's Doukhobors has not been extensive. However, a number of articles, mostly published in the 1960s and 1970s, noted a variety of features in Doukhobors' Russian speech that were indeed characteristic of Southern, and in some cases Central Russian dialects, e.g. use of the Southern [h] where Standard Russian has [g].\n\nFeatures characteristic of a number of locales in the East Slavic language space were noted as well, reflecting perhaps the heterogeneous origin of the Doukhobors' settlements in Molochna River after 1800, e.g., similarly to Belarusians, Doukhobor speakers don't palatalize [r] in \"редко\" (\"redko\", 'seldom'). Remarkable was the dropping of the final -t in the 3rd person singular form of verbs. This can be considered a Ukrainian feature, and it is also attested in some Russian dialects spoken in Southern Ukraine (e.g., Nikolaev, not too far from the Doukhobors' old homeland on the Molochna).\n\nAs with other immigrant groups, the Russian speech of the Doukhobors uses English loanwords for some concepts that they had not encountered until moving to Canada.\n\n\n\n"}

Echo suppressors were developed in the 1950s in response to the first use of satellites for telecommunications, but they have since been largely supplanted by better performing echo cancellers.\n\nEcho suppression and cancellation methods are commonly called acoustic echo suppression (AES) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), and more rarely line echo cancellation (LEC). In some cases, these terms are more precise, as there are various types and causes of echo with unique characteristics, including acoustic echo (sounds from a loudspeaker being reflected and recorded by a microphone, which can vary substantially over time) and line echo (electrical impulses caused by, e.g., coupling between the sending and receiving wires, impedance mismatches, electrical reflections, etc., which varies much less than acoustic echo). In practice, however, the same techniques are used to treat all types of echo, so an acoustic echo canceller can cancel line echo as well as acoustic echo. \"AEC\" in particular is commonly used to refer to echo cancelers in general, regardless of whether they were intended for acoustic echo, line echo, or both.\n\nAlthough echo suppressors and echo cancellers have similar goals—preventing a speaking individual from hearing an echo of their own voice—the methods they use are different:\n\nITU standards G.168 and P.340 describe requirements and tests for echo cancellers in digital and PSTN applications, respectively.\n\nIn telephony, echo is the reflected copy of one's voice heard some time later. If the delay is fairly significant (more than a few hundred milliseconds), it is considered annoying. If the delay is very small (10s of milliseconds or less), the phenomenon is called sidetone. If the delay is slightly longer, around 50 milliseconds, humans cannot hear the echo as a distinct sound, but instead hear a chorus effect.\n\nIn the earlier days of telecommunications, echo suppression was used to reduce the objectionable nature of echos to human users. One person speaks while the other listens, and they speak back and forth. An echo suppressor attempts to determine which is the primary direction and allows that channel to go forward. In the reverse channel, it places attenuation to block or \"suppress\" any signal on the assumption that the signal is echo. Although the suppressor effectively deals with echo, this approach leads to several problems which may be frustrating for both parties to a call.\n\nIn response to this, AT&T Bell Labs developed echo canceler theory in the early 1960s, which then resulted in laboratory echo cancelers in the late 1960s and commercial echo cancelers in the 1980s.\n\nThe concept of an echo canceller is to synthesize an estimate of the echo from the talker's signal, and subtract that synthesis from the return path instead of switching attenuation into/out of the path. This technique requires adaptive signal processing to generate a signal accurate enough to effectively cancel the echo, where the echo can differ from the original due to various kinds of degradation along the way.\n\nRapid advances in the implementation of digital signal processing allowed echo cancellers to be made smaller and more cost-effective. In the 1990s, echo cancellers were implemented within voice switches for the first time (in the Northern Telecom DMS-250) rather than as standalone devices. The integration of echo cancellation directly into the switch meant that echo cancellers could be reliably turned on or off on a call-by-call basis, removing the need for separate trunk groups for voice and data calls. Today's telephony technology often employs echo cancellers in small or handheld communications devices via a software voice engine, which provides cancellation of either acoustic echo or the residual echo introduced by a far-end PSTN gateway system; such systems typically cancel echo reflections with up to 64 milliseconds delay.\n\nSince invention at AT&T Bell Labs echo cancellation algorithms have been improved and honed. Like all echo cancelling processes, these first algorithms were designed to anticipate the signal which would inevitably re-enter the transmission path, and cancel it out.\n\nThe acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) process works as follows:\n\n\nThe primary challenge for an echo canceller is determining the nature of the filtering to be applied to the far-end signal such that it resembles the resultant near-end signal. The filter is essentially a model of speaker, microphone and the room's acoustical attributes. Echo cancellers must be adaptive because the characteristics of the near-end's speaker and microphone are generally not known in advance. The acoustical attributes of the near-end's room are also not generally known in advance, and may change (e.g., if the microphone is moved relative to the speaker, or if individuals walk around the room causing changes in the acoustic reflections). By using the far-end signal as the stimulus, modern systems use an adaptive filter and can 'converge' from nothing to 55 dB of cancellation in around 200 ms.\n\nUntil recently echo cancellation only needed to apply to the voice bandwidth of telephone circuits. PSTN calls transmit frequencies between 300 Hz and 3 kHz, the range required for human speech intelligibility. Videoconferencing is one area where full bandwidth audio is transceived. In this case, specialised products are employed to perform echo cancellation.\n\nEcho suppression may have the side-effect of removing valid signals from the transmission. This can cause audible signal loss that is called \"clipping\" in telephony, but the effect is more like a \"squelch\" than amplitude clipping. In an ideal situation then, echo cancellation alone will be used. However this is insufficient in many applications, notably software phones on networks with long delay and meager throughput. Here, echo cancellation and suppression can work in conjunction to achieve acceptable performance.\n\nEcho is measured as (ERL). This is the difference in signal strength between the original far-end signal and the echo of that signal transmitted as the output of the near-end, expressed in decibels. In other words, ERL is the amount of signal loss applied to the original far-end signal that returns as echo. High values mean the echo is very weak, while low or negative values mean the echo is very strong (negative values would mean the echo is stronger than the original signal which was put in, which if left unchecked would cause feedback).\n\nThe performance of an echo canceller is measured in \"echo return loss enhancement\" (ERLE), which is the amount of additional signal loss applied by the echo canceller. Most echo cancellers are able to apply 18 to 35 dB ERLE.\n\nThe total signal loss of the echo (ACOM) is the sum of the ERL and ERLE.\n\nVoice messaging and voice response systems which accept speech for caller input use echo cancellation while speech prompts are played to prevent the systems own speech recognition from falsely recognizing the echoed prompts.\n\nExamples of echo are found in everyday surroundings such as:\n\nIn most of these cases, direct sound from the loudspeaker (not the person at the far end, otherwise referred to as the Talker) enters the microphone almost unaltered. The difficulties in cancelling echo stem from the alteration of the original sound by the ambient space. These changes can include certain frequencies being absorbed by soft furnishings, and reflection of different frequencies at varying strength.\n\nIn modern times, the main use of an AES (over an AEC) lies in the VoIP sector. This is primarily because AECs require a fast processor, usually in the form of a digital signal processor (DSP). For the PC market, and especially for the embedded VoIP market, this cost in MHz comes at a premium. This said, many (embedded) VoIP solutions do have a fully functional AEC.\n\nEcho control on voice-frequency data calls that use dial-up modems may cause data corruption. Some telephone devices disable echo suppression or echo cancellation when they detect the 2100 or 2225 Hz \"answer\" tones associated with such calls, in accordance with ITU-T recommendation G.164 or G.165.\n\nIn the 1990s most echo cancellation was done inside modems of type v.32 and later. In voiceband modems this allowed using the same frequencies in both directions simultaneously, greatly increasing the data rate. As part of connection negotiation, each modem sent line probe signals, measured the echoes, and set up its delay lines. Echoes in this case did not include long echoes caused by acoustic coupling, but did include short echoes caused by impedance mismatches in the 2-wire local loop to the telephone exchange.\n\nAfter the turn of the century, DSL modems also made extensive use of automated echo cancellation. Though they used separate incoming and outgoing frequencies, these frequencies were beyond the voiceband for which the cables were designed, and often suffered attenuation distortion due to bridge taps and incomplete impedance matching. Deep, narrow frequency gaps often resulted, that could not be made usable by echo cancellation. These were detected and mapped out during connection negotiation.\n\n\n"}

This includes constructing walls, floors and ceilings, and inserting cables for electrical supply and pipes for water supply.\n\nSome argue that First Fix starts after the shell of the building is complete, and ends when the walls are plastered. Here is a list, in no particular order, of the elements of First Fix.\n\nThe list is not exhaustive. \n\n\"Second fix\" comprises all the work after the plastering of a finished house. Electrical fixtures are connected to the cables, sinks and baths connected to the pipes, and doors fitted into doorframes. Second fix work requires a neater finish than first fix.\n\nThe division of work is a convenient description because electricians, plumbers and carpenters will probably have to make two separate visits to one property under construction, at separate times. Project managers can report \"first fix complete\" or \"second fix 50% done\" and others can understand.\n\nSome construction companies specialise in first fix work or second fix work, but most do both.\n\nIn North America, terms such as roughing in and finishing or rough-in and finish work are often heard, referring to similar concepts. Another related set of terms is outside work and inside work (the building is closed to the weather when the latter occurs). Carpenters speak of rough work and trim work (or framing versus trimming), and other fields have analogues, such as machining (roughing versus finishing cuts) and communications (rough draft versus revised draft).\n\nElectrical installations can be further divided into first, second and third fixes:\n\n\nAs modern society's reliance on technology increases, the need to properly house sensitive electronic equipment becomes a greater concern. The installation of this equipment takes place in the \"third fix\" segment of a construction project. It is especially important that installation of sensitive electronic equipment be installed only when a construction site is dust-controlled and prepared for what would be considered \"dust free\" conditions. For example, for the modern computer server room, equipment would be installed only when dust and atmospheric conditions are minimized and controlled. Similar to the atmospheric needs of medical and scientific research laboratories, the production sensitive computer chip technology is undertaken in a cleanroom atmosphere where low levels of environmental pollutants such as dust and airborne microbes are controlled and most preferably eliminated.\n\nThe UK national building specifications, British Standard 5295:1989, specifically addresses \"clean room\" environments serving electronics manufacturers, as well as the pharmaceutical industry (the Pharmaceutical Industry has, for some time, worked to the ISO standard 14644 which is subtly different). Standard 5295:1989 specifically pertains to constructed interior spaces where higher than normal environmental standards must be maintained, in order to control particulate contamination, temperature and humidity. It is only at the third fix stage, when building site conditions are rendered virtually \"dust free\", so as to minimize the introduction, generation and retention of particles which may contaminate equipment serving the electronics and pharmaceuticals manufacturing process, that the build-out of \"clean room\" spaces can commence.\n"}

Of the relatively small number of dramas that are extant in manuscript, the majority are from the (1625–1660) rather than the Elizabethan and Jacobean era (1558–1625), and most are fair copies of plays by professional scribes like Ralph Crane.\n\nIn a rare direct reference to foul papers and fair copies, Robert Daborne mentions both in a November 1613 letter to theatrical manager Philip Henslowe: \"I send you the foul sheet and the fair I was writing\" – which appears to indicate that Daborne prepared a fair copy of his working drafts as he wrote.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25008327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25008327", "title": "Interslavic language", "text": "Interslavic language\n\nInterslavic is a zonal constructed language based on the Slavic languages. Its purpose is to facilitate communication between representatives of different Slavic nations, as well as to allow people who do not know any Slavic language to communicate with Slavs. For the latter, it can fulfill an educational role as well.\n\nInterslavic can be classified as a semi-constructed language. It is essentially a modern continuation of Old Church Slavonic, but also draws on the various improvised language forms Slavs have been using for centuries to communicate with Slavs of other nationalities, for example in multi-Slavic environments and on the Internet, providing them with a scientific base. Thus, both grammar and vocabulary are based on the commonalities between the Slavic languages, and non-Slavic elements are avoided. Its main focus lies on instant understandability rather than easy learning, a balance typical for naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) languages.\n\nThe language has a long history, predating constructed languages like Volapük and Esperanto by centuries: the oldest description, written by the Croatian priest Juraj Križanić, goes back to the years 1659–1666. In its current form, Interslavic was created in 2006 under the name Slovianski. In 2011, Slovianski underwent a thorough reform and merged with two other projects, simultaneously changing its name to \"Interslavic\", a name that was first proposed by the Czech Ignac Hošek in 1908.\n\nInterslavic can be written using the Latin and the Cyrillic alphabets.\n\nThe history of the Interslavic or Pan-Slavic language is closely connected with Pan-Slavism, an ideology that endeavors cultural and political unification of all Slavs, based on the conception that all Slavic people are part of a single Slavic nation. Along with this belief came also the need for a Slavic umbrella language. A strong candidate for that position was Russian, the language of the largest (and during most of the 19th century the only) Slavic state and also mother tongue of more than half of the Slavs. This option enjoyed most of its popularity in Russia itself, but was also favoured by Pan-Slavists abroad, for example the Slovak Ľudovít Štúr. Others believed that Old Church Slavonic was a better and also more neutral solution. In previous centuries, this language had served as an administrative language in a large part of the Slavic world, and it was still used on a large scale in Orthodox liturgy, where it played a role similar to Latin in the West. Old Church Slavonic had the additional advantage of being very similar to the common ancestor of the Slavic languages, Proto-Slavic. However, Old Church Slavonic had several practical disadvantages as well: it was written in a highly archaic form of Cyrillic, grammar was complex and its vocabulary was characterized by many obsolete words as well as the absence of words for modern concepts. Hence, early examples of Pan-Slavic language projects were aimed at modernizing Old Church Slavonic and adapting it to the needs of everyday communication.\n\nThe first Interslavic grammar, \"Gramatíčno izkâzanje ob rúskom jezíku\" by the Croatian priest Juraj Križanić, was written in 1665. He referred to the language as Ruski, but in reality it was mostly based on a mixture of the Russian edition of Church Slavonic and his own Ikavian Čakavian dialect of Croatian. Križanić used it not only for this grammar, but also in other works, including the treatise \"Politika\" (1663–1666). According to an analysis of the Dutch Slavist Tom Ekman, 59% of the words used in \"Politika\" are of common Slavic descent, 10% come from Russian and Church Slavonic, 9% from Croatian and 2.5% from Polish.\n\nIt should be noted that Križanić was not the first who attempted writing in a language understandable to all Slavs. In 1583 another Croatian priest, Šime Budinić, had translated the \"Summa Doctrinae Christanae\" by Petrus Canisius into \"Slovignsky\", in which he used both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.\n\nAfter Križanić, numerous other efforts have been made to create an umbrella language for the speakers of Slavic languages. A notable example is Universalis Lingua Slavica by the Slovak attorney Ján Herkeľ (1786–1853), published in Latin and in Slovak in 1826. Unlike Križanić' project, this project was closer to the West Slavic languages.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century Pan-Slavic language projects were mostly the domain of Slovenes and Croats. In this era of awakening national consciousness, the Russians were the only Slavs who had their own state; other Slavic peoples inhabited large, mostly non-Slavic states, and clear borders between the various nations were mostly lacking. Among the numerous efforts at creating written standards for the South Slavic languages there were also efforts at establishing a common South Slavic language, Illyrian, that might also serve as a literary language for all Slavs in the future. Of special importance is the work of Matija Majar (1809–1892), a Slovenian Austroslavist who later converted to Pan-Slavism. In 1865 he published Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski (\"Mutual Slavic Orthography\"). In this work, he postulated that the best way for Slavs to communicate with other Slavs was taking own language as a starting point and then modifying it in steps. First, he proposed changing the orthography of each individual language into a generic (\"mutual\") Pan-Slavic orthography, subsequently he described a grammar that was based on comparing the five major Slavic languages of his days: Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Polish, Czech and Serbian. Apart from a book about the language itself, Majar also used it for a biography of Cyril and Methodius and for a magazine he published in the years 1873–1875, \"Slavjan\". A fragment in the language can still be seen on the altar of Majar's church in Görtschach. Other Pan-Slavic language projects were published in the same period by the Croatian Matija Ban, the Slovenes Radoslav Razlag and Božidar Raič, as well as the Bulgarian from Macedonia Grigor Parlichev – all based on the idea of combining Old Church Slavonic with elements from the modern South Slavic languages.\n\nAll authors mentioned above were motivated by the belief that all Slavic languages were dialects of one single Slavic language rather than separate languages. They deplored the fact that these dialects had diverged beyond mutual comprehensibility, and the Pan-Slavic language they envisioned was intended to reverse this process. Their long-term objective was that this language would replace the individual Slavic languages. Majar, for example, compared the Pan-Slavic language with standardized languages like Ancient Greek and several modern languages:\n\nConsequently, these authors did not consider their projects constructed languages at all. In most cases they provided grammatical comparisons between the Slavic languages, sometimes but not always offering solutions they labelled as \"Pan-Slavic\". What their projects have in common that they neither have a rigidly prescriptive grammar, nor a separate vocabulary.\n\nIn the early 20th century it had become clear that the divergence of the Slavic languages was irreversible and the concept of a Pan-Slavic literary language was no longer realistic. The Pan-Slavic dream had lost most of its power, and Pan-Slavists had to satisfy themselves with the formation of two multinational Slavic states, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. However, the need for a common language of communication for Slavs was still felt, and due to the influence of constructed languages like Esperanto, efforts were made to create a language that was no longer supposed to replace the individual Slavic languages, but to serve as an additional second language for Interslavic communication.\n\nIn the same period, the nexus of Interslavic activity shifted to the North, especially to the Czech lands. In 1907 the Czech dialectologist Ignac Hošek (1852–1919) published a grammar of Neuslavisch, a proposal for a common literary language for all Slavs within the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Five years later another Czech, Josef Konečný, published Slavina, a \"Slavic Esperanto\", which however had very little in common with Esperanto, but instead was mostly based on Czech. Whereas these two projects were naturalistic, the same cannot be said about two other projects by Czech authors, Slovanština by Edmund Kolkop and Slavski jezik by Bohumil Holý. Both projects, published in 1912 and 1920 respectively, show a clear tendency towards simplification, for example by eliminating grammatical gender and cases, and schematicism. \n\nDuring the 1950s the Czech poet and former Esperantist Ladislav Podmele (1920–2000), also known under his pseudonym \"Jiří Karen\", worked for several years with a team of prominent interlinguists on an elaborate project, Mežduslavjanski jezik (\"Interslavic language\"). Among other things, they wrote a grammar, an Esperanto–Interslavic word list, a dictionary, a course and a textbook. Although none of those were ever published, the project gained some attention of linguists from various countries. Probably due to the political reality of those days, this language was primarily based on Russian.\n\nAlthough Pan-Slavism has not played a role of any significance since the collapse of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, globalization and new media like the Internet have led to a renewed interest in a language that would be understandable for all Slavs alike. Older projects were largely forgotten, but as it became relatively easy for authors of new projects to publish their work, several new projects emerged. Most of them originated from Slavic émigrée circles. During the first years of the 21st century, especially Slovio of the Slovak Mark Hučko acquired some fame. Unlike most previous projects it was not a naturalistic, but a schematic language, its grammar being based largely on Esperanto. Slovio was not only intended to serve as an auxiliary language for Slavs, but also for use on a global scale like Esperanto. For that reason it gained little acceptance among Slavs: a high degree of simplification, characteristic for most international auxiliary languages, makes it easier to learn for non-Slavs, but widens the distance with the natural Slavic languages and gives the language an overly synthetic character, which by many is considered a disadvantage.\n\nIn March 2006, the Slovianski project was started by a group of people from different countries, who felt the need for a simple and neutral Slavic language that the Slavs could understand without prior learning. The language they envisioned should be naturalistic and only consist of material existing in all or most Slavic languages, without any artificial additions. Initially, Slovianski was being developed in two different variants: a naturalistic version known as Slovianski-N (initiated by Jan van Steenbergen and further developed by Igor Polyakov), and a more simplified version known as Slovianski-P (initiated by Ondrej Rečnik and further developed by Gabriel Svoboda). The difference was that Slovianski-N had six grammatical cases, while Slovianski-P—like English, Bulgarian and Macedonian—used prepositions instead. Apart from these two variants (N stands for \"naturalism\", P for \"pidgin\" or \"prosti\" \"simple\"), a schematic version, Slovianski-S, has been experimented with as well, but was abandoned in an early stage of the project. In 2009 it was decided that only the naturalistic version would be continued under the name Slovianski. Although Slovianski had three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), six cases and full conjugation of verbs—features usually avoided in international auxiliary languages—a high level of simplification was achieved by means of simple, unambiguous endings and irregularity being kept to a minimum.\n\nSlovianski was mostly used in Internet traffic and in a news letter, \"Slovianska Gazeta\". In February and March 2010 there was much publicity about Slovianski after articles had been dedicated to it on the Polish internet portal \"Interia.pl\" and the Serbian newspaper \"Večernje Novosti\". Shortly thereafter, articles about Slovianski appeared in the Slovak newspaper \"Pravda\", on the news site of the Czech broadcasting station ČT24, in the Serbian blogosphere and the Serbian edition of \"Reader's Digest\", as well as other newspapers and internet portals in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Ukraine.\nSlovianski has played a role in the development of other, related projects as well. Rozumio (2008) and Slovioski (2009) were both efforts to build a bridge between Slovianski and Slovio. Originally, Slovioski, developed by Polish-American Steeven Radzikowski, was merely intended to reform Slovio, but gradually it developed into a separate language. Like Slovianski, it was a collaborative project that existed in two variants: a \"full\" and a simplified version. In January 2010 a new language was published, Neoslavonic (\"Novoslovienskij\", later \"Novoslověnsky\") by the Czech Vojtěch Merunka, based on Old Church Slavonic grammar but using part of Slovianski's vocabulary.\n\nIn 2011, Slovianski, Slovioski and Novoslověnsky merged into one common project under the name Interslavic (\"Medžuslovjanski\"). Slovianski grammar and dictionary were expanded to include all options of Neoslavonic as well, turning it into a more flexible language based on prototypes rather than fixed rules. From that time Slovianski and Neoslavonic have no longer been developed as separate projects, even though their names are still frequently in use as synonyms or \"dialects\" of Interslavic.\n\nIn the same year, the various simplified forms of Slovianski and Slovioski that were meant to meet the needs of beginners and non-Slavs, were reworked into a highly simplified form of Interslavic, Slovianto.\n\nAfter the 2017 CISLa conference, the project of unifying the two standards of Interslavic has been commenced by Merunka and van Steenbergen, with a planned new, singular grammar and orthography. An early example of this endeavor is Merunka and van Steenbergen's joint publication on Slavic cultural diplomacy, released to coincide with the conference.\n\nInterslavic has an active community, including an Internet forum with around 460 members and two Facebook groups with more than 1294 and 907 members respectively, Furthermore, the project has two online news portals , an expert journal focusing on issues of Slavic peoples in the wider sociocultural context of current times and a wiki united with a collection of texts and materials in Interslavic language somewhat similar to Wikisource.\n\nThe number of people who speak Interslavic is difficult to establish; the lack of demographic data is a common problem among constructed languages, so that estimates are always rough. The Bulgarian author G. Iliev mentions a number of \"several hundreds of speakers\" in 2012, the language's Facebook page mentions 4600 speakers.\n\nIn June 2017 an international conference took place in the Czech town of Staré Město near Uherské Hradiště, which was dedicated to Interslavic. The presentations were either held in Interslavic or translated into Interslavic. A second conference took place in 2018.\n\nOne of the main principles of Interslavic is that it can be written on any Slavic keyboard. The border between Latin and Cyrillic runs through the middle of Slavic territory, and therefore both alphabets can be used. Because of the differences between for example the Polish alphabet and other Latin alphabets, as well as between Serbian/Macedonian Cyrillic and other forms of Cyrillic, Interslavic has no official orthography, but uses a prototype orthography instead, which means that many phonemes can be written and pronounced in various ways. For example, the distinction between hard and soft consonants (t vs. ť, r vs. ŕ, etc.), characteristic for the West and East Slavic languages, is optional both in speaking and in writing. Because Interslavic is not an ethnic language, there are no hard and fast rules regarding accentuation either.\n\nWhat all varieties of Interslavic have in common is the following basic set of phonemes that can be found in all Slavic languages:\n\nApart from the basic alphabet above, other characters are used as well, usually carrying a diacritic, convey additional etymological information and linking directly to Proto-Slavic and Old Church Slavonic. Their usage is not mandatory. The purpose of these characters is threefold:\n\nLastly, the following ligatures can also be encountered in Interslavic:\n\nThe consonants ľ, ń, ŕ, ť, ď, ś and ź are softened or palatalized counterparts of l, n, r, t, d, s and z. The latter may also be pronounced like their softened/palatalized equivalents before i, ě, ę and possibly before e. This pronunciation is not mandatory, though: they may as well be written and pronounced hard.\n\nSoft consonants are normally represented by an acute or a haček, but other ways of writing are possible as well: nj, n’, etc. To avoid texts from becoming heavy on diacritics, it is recommended that before a vowel, soft consonants are written as a hard consonant followed by a j: nom. \"koń\", gen. \"konja\" (instead of \"końa\"). In the most recent revision of the language as of March 28th, 2018 - the recommended standard for writing the [ɲ] sound is nj at all times, even with no adjacent vowels. The letter ń is to be optionally used exclusively when j follows the [ɲ] phoneme and the two sounds are meant to be pronounced separately, such as in the suffix \"-ńje\", which is a common ending to the present participle form of many verbs.\n\nInterslavic grammar is based on the greatest common denominator of that of the natural Slavic languages, and partly also a simplification thereof. It consists of elements that can be encountered in all or at least most of them.\n\nInterslavic is an inflecting language. Nouns can have three genders, two numbers (singular and plural), as well as six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental and locative). Since several Slavic languages also have a vocative, it is usually displayed in tables as well, even though strictly speaking the vocative is not a case. It occurs only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns.\n\nThere is no article. The complicated system of noun classes in Slavic has been reduced to four or five declensions:\n\nAdjectives are always regular. They agree with the noun they modify in gender, case and number, and are usually placed before it. In the column with the masculine forms, the first relates to animate nouns, the second to inanimate nouns. A distinction is made between hard and soft stems, for example: \"dobry\" \"good\" and \"svěži\" \"fresh\":\n\nSome writers do not distinguish between hard and soft adjectives. One can write \"dobrego\" instead of \"dobrogo\", \"svěžogo\" instead of \"svěžego\".\n\nThe comparative is formed with the ending -(ěj)ši: \"slabši \"weaker\", \"pòlnějši \"fuller\". The superlative is formed by adding the prefix naj- to the comparative: najslabši \"weakest\". Comparatives can also be formed with the adverbs \"bolje\" or \"vyše\" \"more\", superlatives with the adverbs \"najbolje\" or \"najvyše\" \"most\".\n\nAn adjective can be turned into an adverb with the ending -o: \"dobro \"well\", \"svěžo\" \"freshly\". Comparatives and superlatives can be adverbialized with the ending -ěje: \"slaběje \"weaker\".\n\nThe personal pronouns are: ja \"I\", ty \"you, thou\", on \"he\", ona \"she\", ono \"it\", my \"we\", vy \"you\" (pl.), oni \"they\". When a personal pronoun of the third person is preceded by a preposition, n- is placed before it.\n\nOther pronouns are inflected as adjectives:\n\nThe cardinal numbers 1–10 are: 1 – jedin/jedna/jedno, 2 – dva/dvě, 3 – tri, 4 – četyri, 5 – pęť, 6 – šesť, 7 – sedm, 8 – osm, 9 – devęť, 10 – desęť.\n\nHigher numbers are formed by adding -nadsęť for the numbers 11–19, -desęt for the tens, -sto for the hundreds. Sometimes (but not always) the latter is inflected: \"dvasto/tristo/pęťsto\" and \"dvěstě/trista/pęťsòt\" are both correct.\n\nThe inflection of the cardinal numerals is shown in the following table. The numbers 5–99 are inflected either as nouns of the \"kosť\" type or as soft adjectives.\n\nOrdinal numbers are formed by adding the adjective ending -y to the cardinal numbers, except in the case of \"pŕvy\" \"first\", \"drugi/vtory\" \"second\", \"tretji\" \"third\", \"četvŕty\" \"fourth\", \"stoty/sòtny\" \"hundredth\", \"tysęčny\" \"thousandth\".\n\nFractions are formed by adding the suffix -ina to ordinal numbers: \"tretjina\" \"(one) third\", \"četvŕtina\" \"quarter\", etc. The only exception is \"pol\" (\"polovina, polovica\") \"half\".\n\nInterslavic has other categories of numerals as well:\n\nLike all Slavic languages, Interslavic verbs have grammatical aspect. A perfective verb indicates an action that has been or will be completed and therefore emphasizes the result of the action rather than its course. On the other hand, an imperfective verb focuses on the course or duration of the action, and is also used for expressing habits and repeating patterns.\n\nVerbs without a prefix are usually imperfective. Most imperfective verbs have a perfective counterpart, which in most cases is formed by adding a prefix:\n\"dělati ~ sdělati\" \"to do\"\n\"čistiti ~ izčistiti\" \"to clean\"\n\"pisati ~ napisati\" \"to write\"\nBecause prefixes are also used to change the meaning of a verb, secondary imperfective forms based on perfective verbs with a prefix are needed as well. These verbs are formed regularly:\n\nSome aspect pairs are irregular, for example \"nazvati ~ nazyvati\" \"to name, to call\", \"prijdti ~ prihoditi\" \"to come\", \"podjęti ~ podimati\" \"to undertake\".\n\nThe Slavic languages are notorious for their complicated conjugation patterns. To simply these, Interslavic has a system of two conjugations and two verbal stems. In most cases, knowing the infinitive is enough to establish both stems:\nThere are also mixed and irregular verbs, i.e. verbs with a second stem that cannot be derived regularly from the first stem, for example: \"pisati\" \"to write\" > \"piš-\", \"spati\" \"to sleep\" > \"sp-i-\", \"zvati\" \"to call\" > \"zov-\", \"htěti\" \"to want\" > \"hoć-\". In these cases both stem have to be learned separately.\n\nThe various moods and tenses are formed by means of the following endings:\n\nThe forms with -l- in the past tense and the conditional are actually participles known as the \"L-participle\". The remaining participles are formed as follows:\n\nThe \"verbal noun\" is based on the past passive participle, replacing the ending -ny/-ty with -nje/-.\n\nWhenever the stem of a verbs of the second conjugation ends in s, z, t, d, st or zd, an ending starting -j causes the following mutations:\n\nBecause Interslavic is not a highly formalized language, a lot of variation occurs between various forms. Often used are the following alternative forms:\n\nA few verbs have an irregular conjugation:\n\nWords in Interslavic are based on comparison of the vocabulary of the modern Slavic languages. For this purpose, the latter are subdivided into six groups:\nThese groups are treated equally. Interslavic vocabulary has been compiled in such way that words are understandable to a maximum number of Slavic speakers. The form in which a chosen word is adopted depends not only on its frequency in the modern Slavic languages, but also on the inner logic of Interslavic, as well as its form in Proto-Slavic: to ensure coherence, a system of regular derivation is applied.\n\nThe Pater Noster:\n\n\n\n"}

The same specifications are to be used for both small and large lexicons, for both simple and complex lexicons, for both written and spoken lexical representations. The descriptions range from morphology, syntax, computational semantics to computer-assisted translation. The covered languages are not restricted to European languages but cover all natural languages. The range of targeted NLP applications is not restricted. LMF is able to represent most lexicons, including WordNet, EDR and PAROLE lexicons.\n\nIn the past, lexicon standardization has been studied and developed by a series of projects like GENELEX, EDR, EAGLES, MULTEXT, PAROLE, SIMPLE and ISLE. Then, the ISO/TC37 National delegations decided to address standards dedicated to NLP and lexicon representation.\nThe work on LMF started in Summer 2003 by a new work item proposal issued by the US delegation. In Fall 2003, the French delegation issued a technical proposition for a data model dedicated to NLP lexicons. In early 2004, the ISO/TC37 committee decided to form a common ISO project with Nicoletta Calzolari (CNR-ILC Italy) as convenor and Gil Francopoulo (Tagmatica France) and Monte George (ANSI USA) as editors.\nThe first step in developing LMF was to design an overall framework based on the general features of existing lexicons and to develop a consistent terminology to describe the components of those lexicons. The next step was the actual design of a comprehensive model that best represented all of the lexicons in detail. A large panel of 60 experts contributed a wide range of requirements for LMF that covered many types of NLP lexicons. The editors of LMF worked closely with the panel of experts to identify the best solutions and reach a consensus on the design of LMF. Special attention was paid to the morphology in order to provide powerful mechanisms for handling problems in several languages that were known as difficult to handle. 13 versions have been written, dispatched (to the National nominated experts), commented and discussed during various ISO technical meetings. After five years of work, including numerous face-to-face meetings and e-mail exchanges, the editors arrived at a coherent UML model. In conclusion, LMF should be considered a synthesis of the state of the art in NLP lexicon field.\n\nThe ISO number is 24613. The LMF specification has been published officially as an International Standard on 17 November 2008.\n\nThe ISO/TC37 standards are currently elaborated as high level specifications and deal with word segmentation (ISO 24614), annotations (ISO 24611 a.k.a. MAF, ISO 24612 a.k.a. LAF, ISO 24615 a.k.a. SynAF, and ISO 24617-1 a.k.a. SemAF/Time), feature structures (ISO 24610), multimedia containers (ISO 24616 a.k.a. MLIF), and lexicons (ISO 24613).\nThese standards are based on low level specifications dedicated to constants, namely data categories (revision of ISO 12620), language codes (ISO 639), scripts codes (ISO 15924), country codes (ISO 3166) and Unicode (ISO 10646).\n\nThe two level organization forms a coherent family of standards with the following common and simple rules:\n\nThe linguistics constants like /feminine/ or /transitive/ are not defined within LMF but are recorded in the Data Category Registry (DCR) that is maintained as a global resource by ISO/TC37 in compliance with ISO/IEC 11179-3:2003. And these constants are used to adorn the high level structural elements.\n\nThe LMF specification complies with the modeling principles of Unified Modeling Language (UML) as defined by Object Management Group (OMG). The structure is specified by means of UML class diagrams. The examples are presented by means of UML instance (or object) diagrams.\n\nAn XML DTD is given in an annex of the LMF document.\n\nLMF is composed of the following components:\n\nThe extensions are specifically dedicated to morphology, MRD, NLP syntax, NLP semantics, NLP multilingual notations, NLP morphological patterns, multiword expression patterns, and constraint expression patterns.\n\nIn the following example, the lexical entry is associated with a lemma \"clergyman\" and two inflected forms \"clergyman\" and \"clergymen\". The language coding is set for the whole lexical resource. The language value is set for the whole lexicon as shown in the following UML instance diagram.\n\nThe elements \"Lexical Resource\", \"Global Information\", \"Lexicon\", \"Lexical Entry\", \"Lemma\", and \"Word Form\" define the structure of the lexicon. They are specified within the LMF document.\nOn the contrary, \"languageCoding\", \"language\", \"partOfSpeech\", \"commonNoun\", \"writtenForm\", \"grammaticalNumber\", \"singular\", \"plural\" are data categories that are taken from the Data Category Registry. These marks adorn the structure. The values \"ISO 639-3\", \"clergyman\", \"clergymen\" are plain character strings. The value \"eng\" is taken from the list of languages as defined by ISO 639-3.\n\nWith some additional information like \"dtdVersion\" and \"feat\", the same data can be expressed by the following XML fragment:\n\nThis example is rather simple, while LMF can represent much more complex linguistic descriptions the XML tagging is correspondingly complex.\n\nThe first publication about the LMF specification as it has been ratified by ISO (this paper became (in 2015) the 9th most cited paper within the Language Resources and Evaluation conferences from LREC papers):\n\nAbout semantic representation:\n\nAbout African languages:\n\nAbout Asian languages:\n\nAbout European languages:\n\nAbout Semitic languages:\n\nThere is a book published in 2013: \"LMF Lexical Markup Framework\" which is entirely dedicated to LMF. The first chapter deals with the history of lexicon models, the second chapter is a formal presentation of the data model and the third one deals with the relation with the data categories of the ISO-DCR. The other 14 chapters deal with a lexicon or a system, either in the civil or military domain, either within scientific research labs or for industrial applications. These are Wordnet-LMF, Prolmf, DUELME, UBY-LMF, LG-LMF, RELISH, GlobalAtlas (or Global Atlas) and Wordscape.\n\n\n\n"}

The area occupied by speakers of these languages includes Polynesia, as well as much of Melanesia and Micronesia.\n\nThough covering a vast area, Oceanic languages are spoken by only two million people. The largest individual Oceanic languages are Eastern Fijian with over 600,000 speakers, and Samoan with an estimated 400,000 speakers. The Kiribati (Gilbertese), Tongan, Tahitian, Māori, Western Fijian and Kuanua (Tolai) languages each have over 100,000 speakers.\n\nThe common ancestor which is reconstructed for this group of languages is called Proto-Oceanic (abbr. \"POc\").\n\nThe Oceanic languages were first shown to be a language family by Sidney Herbert Ray in 1896 and, besides Malayo-Polynesian, they are the only established large branch of Austronesian languages. Grammatically, they have been strongly influenced by the Papuan languages of northern New Guinea, but they retain a remarkably large amount of Austronesian vocabulary.\n\nAccording to Lynch, Ross, & Crowley (2002), Oceanic languages often form linkages with each other. Linkages are formed when languages emerged historically from an earlier dialect continuum. The linguistic innovations shared by adjacent languages define a chain of intersecting subgroups (a \"linkage\"), for which no distinct proto-language can be reconstructed.\n\nLynch, Ross, & Crowley (2002) propose three primary groups of Oceanic languages:\n\n\nThe \"residues\" (as they are called by Lynch, Ross, & Crowley), which do not fit into the three groups above, but are still classified as Oceanic are:\n\nRoss & Næss (2007) removed Utupua–Vanikoro, from Central–Eastern Oceanic, to a new primary branch of Oceanic:\n\n\nBlench (2014) considers Utupua and Vanikoro to be two separate branches that are both non-Austronesian.\n\nRoger Blench (2014) argues that many Oceanic languages are in fact non-Austronesian (or \"Papuan\", which is a geographic rather genetic grouping), including Utupua and Vanikoro. Blench doubts that Utupua and Vanikoro are closely related, and thus should not be grouped together. Since each of the three Utupua and three Vanikoro languages are highly distinct from each other, Blench doubts that these languages had diversified on the islands of Utupua and Vanikoro, but had rather migrated to the islands from elsewhere. According to Blench, historically this was due to the Lapita demographic expansion consisting of both Austronesian and non-Austronesian settlers migrating from the Lapita homeland in the Bismarck Archipelago to various islands further to the east.\n\nOther languages traditionally classified as Oceanic that Blench (2014) suspects are in fact non-Austronesian include the Kaulong language of West New Britain, which has a Proto-Malayo-Polynesian vocabulary retention rate of only 5%, and languages of the Loyalty Islands that are spoken just to the north of New Caledonia.\n\nBlench (2014) proposes that languages classified as:\n\nWord order in Oceanic languages is highly diverse, and is distributed in the following geographic regions (Lynch, Ross, & Crowley 2002:49).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3768494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3768494", "title": "Ojibwe phonology", "text": "Ojibwe phonology\n\nThe phonology of the Ojibwe language (also Ojibwa, Ojibway, or Chippewa, and most commonly referred to in the language as Anishinaabemowin) varies from dialect to dialect, but all varieties share common features. Ojibwe is an indigenous language of the Algonquian language family spoken in Canada and the United States in the areas surrounding the Great Lakes, and westward onto the northern plains in both countries, as well as in northeastern Ontario and northwestern Quebec. The article on Ojibwe dialects discusses linguistic variation in more detail, and contains links to separate articles on each dialect. There is no standard language and no dialect that is accepted as representing a standard. Ojibwe words in this article are written in the practical orthography commonly known as the Double vowel system.\n\nOjibwe dialects have the same phonological inventory of vowels and consonants with minor variations, but some dialects differ considerably along a number of phonological parameters. For example, the Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe dialects have changed relative to other dialects by adding a process of vowel syncope that deletes short vowels in specified positions within a word.\n\nThis article primarily uses examples from the Southwestern Ojibwe dialect spoken in Minnesota and Wisconsin, sometimes also known as \"Ojibwemowin\".\n\nOjibwe dialects tend to have 29 phonemes: 11 vowels (seven oral and four nasal) and 18 consonants.\n\nAll dialects of Ojibwe have seven oral vowels. Vowel length is phonologically contrastive, hence phonemic. Although the long and short vowels are phonetically distinguished by vowel quality, recognition of vowel length in phonological representations is required, as the distinction between long and short vowels is essential for the operation of the metrical rule of vowel syncope that characterizes the Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe dialects, as well as for the rules that determine word stress. There are three short vowels, ; and three corresponding long vowels, , in addition to a fourth long vowel , which lacks a corresponding short vowel. The short vowel /i/ typically has phonetic values centering on ; typically has values centering on ; and typically has values centering on . Long is pronounced for many speakers, and is for many .\nbut more generally as\n\nOjibwe has a series of three short oral vowels and four long ones. The two series are characterized by both length and quality differences. The short vowels are (roughly the vowels in American English \"bit\", \"bot\", and \"but\", respectively) and the long vowels are (roughly as in American English \"beet\", \"boat\", \"ball\", and \"bay\" respectively). In the Minnesota variety of Southwestern Ojibwe language, varies between and and varies between and . also may be pronounced and as .\n\nOjibwe has nasal vowels; some arise predictably by rule in all analyses, and other long nasal vowels are of uncertain phonological status. The latter have been analysed both as underlying phonemes, and also as predictable, that is derived by the operation of phonological rules from sequences of a long vowel followed by and another segment, typically .\n\nThe long nasal vowels are \"iinh\" (), \"enh\" (), \"aanh\" (), and \"oonh\" (). They most commonly occur in the final syllable of nouns with diminutive suffixes or words with a diminutive connotation. In the Ottawa dialect long nasal \"aanh\" () occurs as well as in the suffix \"(y)aanh\" ([-() marking the first person (conjunct) animate intransitive. Typical examples from Southwestern Ojibwe include: \"-iijikiwenh-\" ('brother'), \"-noshenh-\" ('cross-aunt'), \"-oozhishenh-\" ('grandchild') \"bineshiinh\" ('bird'), \"asabikeshiinh\" ('spider'), and \"awesiinh\" ('wild animal').\n\nOrthographically the long vowel is followed by word-final to indicate that the vowel is nasal; while is a common indicator of nasality in many languages such as French, the use of is an orthographic convention and does not correspond to an independent sound.\n\nOne analysis of the Ottawa dialect treats the long nasal vowels as phonemic, while another treats them as derived from sequences of long vowel followed by and underlying ; the latter sound is converted to or deleted. Other discussions of the issue in Ottawa are silent on the issue.\n\nA study of the Southwestern Ojibwe (Chippewa) dialect spoken in Minnesota describes the status of the analogous vowels as unclear, noting that while the distribution of the long nasal vowels is restricted, there is a minimal pair distinguished only by the nasality of the vowel: \"giiwe\" ('he goes home') and \"giiwenh\" ('so the story goes').\n\nNasalized allophones of the short vowels also exist. The nasal allophones of oral vowels are derived from a short vowel followed by a nasal+fricative cluster (for example, \"imbanz\", 'I'm singed') is ). For many speakers, the nasal allophones appear not only before nasal+fricative clusters, but also before all fricatives, particularly if the vowel is preceded by another nasal. E.g., for some speakers, \"waabooz\", ('rabbit') is pronounced , and for many, \"mooz\", ('moose') is pronounced .\n\nThe \"voiced/voiceless\" obstruent pairs of Ojibwe vary in their realization depending on the dialect. In many dialects, they are described as having a \"lenis/fortis\" contrast. In this analysis, all obstruents are considered voiceless. The fortis consonants are characterised by being pronounced more strongly and are longer in duration. They often are aspirated or preaspirated. The lenis consonants are often voiced, especially between vowels, although they often tend to be voiceless at the end of words. They are pronounced less strongly and are shorter in duration, compared to the fortis ones. In some communities, the lenis/fortis distinction has been replaced with a pure voiced/voiceless one.\n\nIn some dialects of Saulteaux (Plains Ojibwe), the sounds of and have merged with and respectively. This means that, for example, Southwestern Ojibwe \"wazhashk\", ('muskrat') is pronounced the same as \"wazask\" in some dialects of Saulteaux. This merging creates additional consonant clusters of and in addition to common in all Anishinaabe dialects.\n\nThe glottal fricative occurs infrequently in most dialects, only appearing in a handful of expressive words and interjections, but in a few dialects it has taken the place of .\n\nOjibwe in general permits relatively few consonant clusters, and most are only found word-medially. The permissible ones are -\"sk\"-, -\"shp\"-, -\"sht\"-, -\"shk\"- (which can also appear word-finally), -\"mb\"-, -\"nd\"- (which can also appear word-finally),-\"ng\"- (also word-finally), -\"nj\"- (also word-finally), -\"nz\"-, -\"nzh\"- (also word-finally) and -\"ns\"- (also word-finally). Furthermore, any consonant (except \"w\", \"h\", or \"y\") and some clusters can be followed by \"w\" (although not word-finally). Many dialects, however, permit far more clusters as a result of vowel syncope.\n\nOjibwe divides words into metrical \"feet.\" Counting from the beginning of the word, each group of two syllables constitutes a foot; the first syllable in a foot is weak, the second strong. However, long vowels and vowels in the last syllable of a word are always strong, so if they occur in the weak slot of a foot, then they form a separate one-syllable foot, and counting resumes starting with the following vowel. The final syllable of a word is always strong as well. For example, the word \"bebezhigooganzhii\" ('horse') is divided into feet as (be)(be)(zhi-goo)(gan-zhii). The strong syllables all receive at least secondary stress. The rules that determine which syllable receives the primary stress are quite complex and many words are irregular. In general, though, the strong syllable in the third foot from the end of a word receives the primary stress.\n\nA defining characteristic of several of the more eastern dialects is that they exhibit a great deal of vowel syncope, the deletion of vowels in certain positions within a word. In some dialects (primarily Odawa and Eastern Ojibwe), all unstressed vowels are lost (see above for a discussion of Ojibwe stress). In other dialects (such as some dialects of Central Ojibwe), short vowels in initial syllables are lost, but not in other unstressed syllables. For example, the word \"oshkinawe\" ('young man') of Algonquin and Southwestern Ojibwe (stress: \"oshkinawe\") is \"shkinawe\" in some dialects of Central Ojibwe and \"shkinwe\" in Eastern Ojibwe and Odawa. Regular, pervasive syncope is a comparatively recent development, arising in the past eighty years or so.\n\nA common morphophonemic variation occurs in some verbs whose roots end in -\"n\". When the root is followed by certain suffixes beginning with \"i\" or when it is word-final, the root-final -\"n\" changes to -\"zh\" (e.g., -\"miin\"-, 'to give something to someone' but \"gimiizhim\", 'you guys give it to me'). In Ojibwe linguistics, this is indicated when writing the root with the symbol (so the root 'to give something to someone' would be written ).

Postmodern branding is more about understanding and leveraging technology, space and mindset of the moment to create an enriched user experience. \n<br><br>\nIdris Mootee cites in, “Branding in the Post-Modern Culture When Consumer Transcends the State of Being the Subject in a Society” that brands are becoming more and more important in this day of age. When looking at how the media ecosystem has evolved with the developments of Twitter, Facebook, mobile codes and video, a marketer can see that the brand “exists beyond the ads and the products”. As a result brands have found new ways to enter the home and places in the consumers life. This newly developed entryway and space usually takes the form of branded content, branded entertainment, branded utilities, and most importantly brand personification (which occurs when the brand is treated and engaged with as one would engage with a physical person. i.e. make appointments with, talk to, touching, etc.).\n<br><br>\nThese are behaviors predominantly found in the daily life of the postmodern consumer. Watching scheduled TV programs, utilizing and interacting with voice recognition services like Siri are examples of how branded content and utilities are becoming more predominate within our current culture. Although some examples are eroding away like scheduled TV viewing (according to JD Power and Associates roughly 45% of cable TV service customer have a DVR subscription, which is up from 38% in 2010), others are introduces with remarkable interfaces and user engagement protocols. Mobile applications like Siri allow users interact with their phone at treat it like a personal assistant.\n<br><br>\nSuccessful branding within the postmodern society rely more on the developments of brand personality. Developing brand personality sets the stage in identifying deeper meaning around “How it, the brand, works.” The formation of studying and defining a brand in this manner hinges on the trait theory of psychology. According to this theory, inherent traits (habitual patterns, thoughts and emotions) are perceived to remain relatively stable over time. Holding inherent traits constant while manipulating environmental cues and situational stimuli, natural personalities emerge. When applied to marketing, this process is called a brand-trait observational research study. By performing such studies a brand is able to extract “marketable” personalities; thus creating “livable brand personas”. These personas are then used to help brands live better and more fluently within social destinations, communities and strategist around technical road maps, developments and customer interactions. \n\n"}
{"id": "45637458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45637458", "title": "Power of Women", "text": "Power of Women\n\nThe \"Power of Women\" (\"Weibermacht\" in German) is a medieval and Renaissance artistic and literary topos, showing \"heroic or wise men dominated by women\", presenting \"an admonitory and often humorous inversion of the male-dominated sexual hierarchy\". It was defined by Susan L. Smith as \"the representational practice of bringing together at least two, but usually more, well-known figures from the Bible, ancient history, or romance to exemplify a cluster of interrelated themes that include the wiles of women, the power of love, and the trials of marriage\". Smith argues that the topos is not simply a \"straightforward manifestation of medieval antifeminism\"; rather, it is \"a site of contest through which conflicting ideas about gender roles could be expressed\".\n\nSmith argues the topos originates in classical literature and finds it in medieval texts such as \"Aucassin et Nicolette\", \"The Consolation of Philosophy\", the \"Roman de la Rose\", and the \"Canterbury Tales\". The topos was attacked by Christine de Pizan around 1400, who argued that if women wrote these accounts their interpretations would be different from those of men.\n\nIn the visual arts, images are found in various media, mainly from the 14th century onwards, and becoming increasingly popular in the 15th century. By then the frequently recurring subjects include Judith beheading Holofernes, Phyllis riding Aristotle, Samson and Delilah, Salome and her mother Herodias, Jael killing Sisera, Bathsheba bathing in sight of David, the idolatry of Solomon, Virgil in his basket, as well as many depictions of witches, and genre images of wives dominating their husbands. The last group came to be called the battle for the trousers. Joseph and Potiphar's wife and Lot and his Daughters were somewhat late joiners to the group, but increasingly popular later on. Tomyris, the Scythian queen who defeated Cyrus the Great and abused his corpse, was painted by Rubens and several Italians.\n\nThese scenes, mostly shown in consistent compositions involving just two persons and visually distinctive actions, were easily recognisable and seem to have also been represented dramatically in entertainments of various sorts, whether as short scenes or tableaux vivants. It is not clear who first coined the term \"Weibermacht\", but it had evidently gained currency in the sixteenth century Northern Renaissance in Germany and the Low Countries.\n\nIn early images from the Gothic period genre subjects or \"classical\" ones such as \"Phyllis Riding Aristotle\" and \"Virgil in his Basket\", in fact both medieval legendary accretions, were more popular than the biblical ones predominating later. They often appear on the same pieces as the Assault on the Castle of Love, as on a casket in Baltimore. This and similar subjects of courtly love mostly survive on ivory objects for female use, such as caskets or mirror-cases. It shows ladies defending a castle against men, generally unsuccessfully. These images are essentially light-hearted romantic fantasy given a comic treatment; such scenes were sometimes staged as light relief at tournaments.\n\nThe Power of Women theme is especially popular in Northern Renaissance art from the sixteenth century, which depicts \"images drawn from historical, mythological, and biblical sources that illustrate women's power over men, specifically as a result of their sexual attractiveness\". Several of the stories involve the killing of the male, and this and their religious context effectively remove much of the comic potential of the group, but by no means the erotic possibilites exploited by many artists.\n\nThe question of the attitudes shown towards violence by women in the cause of virtue is perhaps best seen in the figure of Jael, whose killing of Sisera by hammering a tent peg into his head makes an especially graphic image. According to some feminist critics, depictions of her turned hostile in the Renaissance, and like Judith she is certainly grouped with \"bad\" figures such as Herodias and Delilah. Yet she was included, with Judith and Esther, as one of Hans Burgkmair's \"Drei Gut Judin\" (\"Three Good Jewesses\") trio of Biblical heroines in his \"Eighteen Worthies\", adding nine women to the traditional male Nine Worthies.\n\nThe Power of Women subjects are seen in painting and other media, but prints were their special home. Lucas van Leyden made two sets of woodcuts known as \"The Large and Small Power of Women\". The subjects featured include Adam and Eve, Samson and Delilah, King Solomon, Herod and Herodias, Jael and Sisera, and, less usually, Jezebel and King Ahab. The woodcuts have somewhat static compositions, and it has been suggested that they draw from tableaux vivants of the scenes. Another set by Hans Burgkmair (1519) is known as the \"Liebestorheiten\" or \"Follies of Love\". At the same time there was also an interest, often among the same artists, in women from similar settings who were powerless, or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as Susanna, Dido of Carthage, Lucretia, and Verginia. The story of Esther lay somewhere between these two extremes.\n\nThe Little Masters were among those artists greatly interested in both groups. The treatment of both groups, especially in prints, was often frankly erotic, and these groups took their place alongside female saints and lovers both mythological and realistic in the common treatments of women in art. Interest in such themes spread to Italy, affecting Venice first, and the subjects became common in Late Renaissance Italian painting, and even more so during the Baroque, perhaps culminating in the work of Artemisia Gentileschi, who painted nearly all the biblical Power of Women subjects, most more than once. While her choice of subjects is assumed to be driven by her difficult life, Cristofano Allori's best known work, \"Judith with the Head of Holofernes\", uses as models his former mistress for Judith, with her mother as the maid, and a self-portrait for the head of Holofernes.\n\nIn Northern painting, the Cranachs were the first artists to paint the subjects often. In 1513 Lucas Cranach the Elder decorated the nuptial bed of John, Elector of Saxony with a set of scenes including \"The Idolatry of Solomon\" as well as \"Hercules and Omphale\" (see below) and the \"Judgement of Paris\". The respective sons of the patron and artist, John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and Lucas Cranach the Younger, generated another set of paintings, now in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister. The possibility has been raised that some of the Cranach workshop's many \"Judith\"s are portraits of ladies at the Saxon court; some other paintings of Jael certainly are portraits.\n\nSeveral of these subjects contain a part-comical element of role reversal in a society that was essentially patriarchal, above all the \"quintessential image from the Power of Women topos, \"Phyllis Riding Aristotle\".\" The story of Phyllis and Aristotle dates from the early 13th century (when the \"Lai d'Aristote\" was written) and became the subject of popular poems, plays and moralizing sermons. The theme was first analysed by Natalie Zemon Davis in 1975, who concluded that the \"overall functions\" of these reversals was that \"they afforded an expression of, and an outlet for, conflicts about authority within the system; and they also provided occasions by which the authoritarian current in family, workshop, and political life could be moderated by the laughter of disorder and paradoxical play. Accordingly they served to reinforce hierarchical structure\". The role reversal subject of Hercules and Omphale did not fit the main Power of Women trope, as Hercules' period serving Omphale was not caused by interaction between them, and they later married. It became popular from the 16th century, and the Cranach family painted many versions showing Omphale and her ladies dressing Hercules in drag.\n\n\"Phyllis Riding Aristotle\" was painted on the walls of several German town halls, though the design Albrecht Dürer made for Nuremberg, as part of a Power of Women cycle, was never carried out. Some sets of prints have ornamental borders that suggest they were intended to be pasted to walls, as many larger prints were. While many of the smaller prints were probably mostly seen by male collectors and their friends, these paintings and wall-mounted prints \"must have been intended to entertain or amuse both men and women\". Some of the Florentine Otto prints, essentially designed for a female audience, show women triumphing over men, though most show pacific scenes of lovers.\n\nOther large prints intended for walls, where Power of Women subjects are especially common, adopt a different type of composition from the small prints with a few figures, showing large and well-populated panoramic scenes where the key figures can be hard to pick out. \"David and Bathsheba\" or Salome's story are set amid wide townscapes, and Judith kills Holofernes in a corner of a huge battle scene in front of a walled city.\n\nThe association of witchcraft specifically and almost exclusively with women was a novelty of the late 15th century, for which the book \"Malleus Maleficarum\" (1486) remains an emblem, though its significance has been questioned. The interpretation of the many images of witches has been the subject of considerable scholarly interest in recent decades, and many differing interpretations have been put forward. As well as allowing scope for imaginative fantasy, an erotic element is clear, above all in the work of Hans Baldung Grien, the artist most associated with the subject. The seriousness with which either the artist or their audience took the reality of witchcraft has been questioned; to some extent these seem to have been the horror movies of their day. The Witch of Endor was a previously obscure subject that allowed the combination of biblical and witchcraft interest.\n\n\n\n"}

They looked to golden age Latin literature, and especially to Cicero in prose and Virgil in poetry, as the arbiters of Latin style. They abandoned the use of the sequence and other accentual forms of metre, and sought instead to revive the Greek formats that were used in Latin poetry during the Roman period. The humanists condemned the large body of medieval Latin literature as \"Gothic\"—for them, a term of abuse—and believed instead that only ancient Latin from the Roman period was \"real Latin\".\n\nSome 16th-century Ciceronian humanists also sought to purge written Latin of medieval developments in its orthography. They insisted, for example, that \"ae\" be written out in full wherever it occurred in classical Latin; medieval scribes often wrote \"e\" instead of \"ae\". They were much more zealous than medieval Latin writers that \"t\" and \"c\" be distinguished; because the effects of palatalization made them homophones, medieval scribes often wrote, for example, \"eciam\" for \"etiam\". Their reforms even affected handwriting; Humanists usually wrote Latin in a humanist minuscule script derived from Carolingian minuscule, the ultimate ancestor of most contemporary lower-case typefaces, avoiding the black-letter scripts used in the Middle Ages. This sort of writing was particularly vigilant in edited works, so that international colleagues could read them more easily, while in their own handwritten documents the Latin is usually written as it is pronounced in the vernacular. Therefore, the first generations of humanists did not dedicate much care to the orthography till the late sixteenth and seventeenth century. Erasmus proposed that the then-traditional pronunciations of Latin be abolished in favour of his reconstructed version of classical Latin pronunciation, even though one can deduce from his works that he himself used the ecclesiastical pronunciation.\n\nThe humanist plan to remake Latin was largely successful, at least in education. Schools taught the humanistic spellings, and encouraged the study of the texts selected by the humanists, to the large exclusion of later Latin literature. On the other hand, while humanist Latin was an elegant literary language, it became much harder to write books about law, medicine, science or contemporary politics in Latin while observing all of the Humanists' norms about vocabulary purging and classical usage.\n\nRenaissance Latin gradually developed into the New Latin of the 16th–19th centuries, used as the language of choice for authors discussing subjects considered sufficiently important to merit an international (i.e., pan-European) audience.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "155129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155129", "title": "Russenorsk", "text": "Russenorsk\n\nRussenorsk (; , ; ) is an extinct dual-source pidgin language formerly used in the Arctic, which combined elements of Russian and Norwegian, and which was created by Russian traders and Norwegian fishermen from northern Norway and the Russian Kola Peninsula. It was used extensively in Northern Norway for about 150 years in the Pomor trade. Russenorsk is important as a test case for theories concerning pidgin languages since it was used far away from most of the other documented pidgins of the world.\n\nAs is common in the development of pidgins and trade languages, the interaction of fishermen and traders with no common language necessitated the creation of some minimal form of communication. Like all pidgins, Russenorsk had a rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary, mostly composed of words essential to Arctic fishing and trade (fish, weather, etc.) and did not particularly deal with unrelated issues (music, politics, etc.).\n\nBarter existed between Russians and Norwegians for 150 years in Troms and Finnmark counties. This barter was supported by the Norwegian government, and King Christian VII conferred city status to several settlements, such as Tromsø, to facilitate it. Norwegians mainly traded fish for flour and wheat from Russians. The trading went on throughout the sunny months of the year and was beneficial to both sides; Norwegians had access to cheap fish in the summer, whilst Russians had surplus wheat. Traders came from the areas near Murmansk and the White Sea, most often to Vardø, Hammerfest, and Tromsø, sometimes reaching as far south as Lofoten.\n\nThe earliest recorded instance of Russenorsk was in 1785. It is one of the most studied northern pidgins; many linguists, for example, Olaf Broch, studied it. Unlike equatorial pidgins, it was formed from only two languages: Norwegian and Russian. Furthermore, these languages are not from the same branch of Indo-European languages. Also unlike equatorial pidgins, Russenorsk was formed from one social class.\n\nUntil 1850, Russenorsk was socially acceptable for all social classes. In 1850, Russenorsk became more limited to Norwegian fishermen, whereas Norwegian traders spent more time in Russia, often formally studying the language to the extent that they could communicate in rudimentary Russian. This caused Russenorsk to lose some of its prestige.\n\nIn 1917, Finland's declaration of independence from Russia caused the Russian-Norwegian border to decrease significantly. In 1919, the border disappeared completely. Furthermore, the Soviet Union limited international contact significantly, decreasing the need for the common language between Norwegians and Russians. The last such Norwegian-Russian trade occurred in 1923.\n\nRussenorsk uses many of the phonemes mutual to Norwegian and Russian, altering phonemes only used in one.\n\nOne of the characteristics differentiating the pidgin from jargon is its grammar. Russenorsk is mainly influenced by Norwegian grammar, leading some to conclude that it is a variant of Norwegian with some Russian influence.\n\nThere are no clear verb conjugations. The main indication of a verb is the suffix \"-om\", for example, \"kapitan på kajuta slipom\" (the captain is asleep in his cabin). Nominative nouns usually end with \"-a\". Conjunctions used to make compound sentences or dependent clauses are \"ja\", \"i\", and \"jes\". \"Kak\" is used as an interrogative word. The general word order is SVO, with some alterations for questions and sentences with adverbs.\n\n\"På\" is used as the only preposition for the oblique case:\n\nCorpora of Russenorsk consist of lists of individual words and phrases as well as records of dialogues compiled by linguists such as Just Knut Qvigstad. The corpora include c. 400 words, about half of those only appear once in the records (so-called hapax legomena).\n\nThe origin of its vocabulary is generally held to be approximately 40% Russian and 50% Norwegian, with the remaining 10% from Dutch, Low German, French, English, Sami, and Swedish. \n\nMany words in Russenorsk have a synonym from the other primary language.\nSome words can be etymologically traced to both Norwegian and Russian, for example, \"vin\" (Norwegian) and вино (Russian). Some words have an unclear etymology, for example, \"tovara\" or \"vara\" can come from Russian, Swedish, or Finnish.\n\nSome Russenorsk words survive in the dialect of Vardø:\n\nRussenorsk does not have extensive morphology, but has some unique characteristics. The ending \"-om\" does not come from Russian nor Norwegian, but it may come from Solombala English. The ending \"-mann\", from Norwegian, is used to indicate nationality or profession, for example \"russmann\" (Russian), \"burmann\" (Norwegian), or \"kukmann\" (trader). Other morphological features are reduplication, such as \"morra-morradag\" (after tomorrow), and compounding, such as \"kua\" (cow) and \"sjorta\" (shirt) to \"kuasjorta\" (cowhide).\n\nOne characteristic syntactical attribute of Russenorsk is the tendency to move the verb to the final position when the sentence has adverbs. This is found in neither Russian nor Norwegian. Another is that the negator (\"ikke\", \"njet\") precedes the verb, but can be separated from the verb. This is unlike negation in either Russian or Norwegian, but it may have come from Finnish, in which this syntax was probable.\n\nA lack of metalinguistic awareness amongst Russenorsk speakers may have led them to believe they were speaking the language of their interlocutor; that is, that Russians believed they were speaking Norwegian and vice versa.\n\n marks Russian origin, marks Norwegian.\n\n\n"}

The analysis has been criticised by linguists and others.\nOne important ingredient in Freud's analysis was the North-Italian village Trafoi where he received the message of the suicide of one of his patients, struggling with sexual problems. Without Trafoi the substitute Boltraffio rhyming to it would be incomprehensible. Freud links Trafoi to the theme 'death and sexuality', a theme preceding the word finding problem in a conversation Freud had during a trip by train through Bosnia-Herzegowina.\nThe second important ingredient in Freud's analysis is the extraction of an Italian word \"signor\" from the forgotten name Signorelli. \"Herr\", the German counterpart of \"Signor\", is then linked to Herzegowina and the word \"Herr\" occurring, as Freud tells us, in the conversation.\n\nFreud denies the relevance of the content of the frescos. Nevertheless, psychoanalysts have pursued their investigations particularly into this direction, finding however no new explanation of the parapraxis. Jacques Lacan suggested that the parapraxis may be an act of self-forgetting.\n\nThe first critique to Freud came from Emil Kraepelin, who in a postscript to his 1906 monograph on language disturbances in dreams, relates a dream involving Trafoi. The dream centers around a neologism \"Trafei\", which Kraepelin links to Trafoi. The dream may be seen as an implicit critique on Freud's analysis. Italian \"trofei\" is associated to \"Trafei\" in the same way as Trafoi (cf. van Ooijen, 1996) and clarifies Kraepelin's dream. The meaning of \"trofei\" reads in German \"Siegeszeichen\" (victory-signs) and this German word together with Latin \"signum\" clearly links to Freud's first name (Engels, 2006, p. 22-24).\n\nIn \"The Freudian Slip\" Sebastiano Timpanaro discusses Freud's analysis in chapter 6 \"Love and Death at Orvieto.\" (p. 63-81). He in fact doubts, that the name Boltraffio would have played a major role during the parapraxis, as he states: \"Boltraffio is a \"Schlimbesserung\" [that is a substitute worse than another substitute]\" and adds \"the correction goes astray because of incapacity to localize the fault.\"(p. 71). He calls Botticelli an \"involuntary banalization\" and Boltraffio \"a semi-conscious disimproved correction.\"(p. 75). As to the Signor-element in Freud's analysis he puts: \"The immediate equivalence Signore= Herr is one thing, the extraction of \"signor\" from Signorelli and of \"Her(r)\" from Herzegowina is another.\"\n\nPeter Swales (2003) investigated the historical data and states that Freud probably visited an exposition of Italian masters in Bergamo mid-September 1898, showing paintings of Signorelli, Botticelli and Boltraffio one next to the other. In his view the paintings at the exposition were the source of the substitute names in the parapraxis. Swales dwells largely on the three paintings. The association of the name Boltraffio to the name Da Vinci, another hypothesis formulated by Swales (because Freud might have seen the statue of Boltraffio at the bottom of the Da Vinci monument on \"Piazza della Scala\" in Milan some days before his visit to Bergamo), is not further pursued by Swales. Although Freud visited Trafoi on the 8th of August 1898, Swales doubts whether Freud received a message on the suicide of one of his patients.\n\nFreud in his analysis did not use the fact that he remembered very well a picture of the painter in the lower left corner of one of the frescos. The picture, sort of a signature, was thus a third substitute to the forgotten name Signorelli. The \"signature\" can be interpreted as a reference to the Latin verb \"signare\" and this word, instead of Freud's \"signore\", then leads to a simple analysis of the Signorelli parapraxis (Engels, 2006, p. 66-69). There seems to be no more need for the Bosnia-Hercegovina associations (\"Bo\" and \"Herr\") Freud himself introduced. In the alternative to Freud's analysis the suicide message in Trafoi remains an important point to understand the parapraxis (this message being a blow to Freud's self-esteem). The occurrence of the Signorelli parapraxis \"during\" Freud's trip from Ragusa to Trebinje (in Herzegowina) is not questioned, as was done by Swales. \n\n\n\n\n"}

Its original purpose was to describe and propose the ideal standard for poets writing in the Scottish tradition, a tradition which includes James' direct ancestor, James I (1394-1437).\n\nJames VI, as a young poet-king, was both the head and patron of the Castalian Band, a fairly loose circle of court poets which he both established and composed with as peers in the 1580s and early 1590s. It is certain that the treatise was intended to set the aesthetic standard for the writing he wished to advocate. The Castalian poets included Alexander Montgomerie, William Fowler, William Alexander, John Stewart and Alexander Hume and others variously. James' patronage as Scottish king also attracted poets from Northern England, such as Thomas Hudson.\n\nLike most of James' writing, Reulis and Cautelis (\"Rules and Cautions\") was written in his first language, Middle Scots. Because of its subject, it was one of the few manuscripts by the King that was not anglicised by his London publisher Thomas Waldegrave for publication in England.\n\n\n"}

Within an ordinance is a list of land use designations commonly known as zoning. Each different type of zone has its own set of allowed uses. These are known as by-right uses. Then there is an extra set of uses known as special uses. To build a use that is listed as a special use, a special use permit (or \"conditional use permit\") must be obtained.\n\nAn example of a \"special use permit\" may be found in a church applying for one to construct a church building in a residential neighborhood. Although the church building is not a residential building, the zoning law may allow for churches in the residential neighborhood if the local zoning authority may review the impact on the neighborhood. This process grants discretion to the local zoning authority to ensure that an acceptable land use does not disrupt the zoning scheme because of its particular location.\n\nThe Standard State Zoning Enabling Act allows special use permits based upon a finding of compatibility with surrounding areas and with developments already permitted under the general provisions of the ordinance.\n\nIf the local zoning authority grants a special-use permit that exceeds the discretion allowed to it, then an incidence of spot zoning may arise. Such discretion then may be attacked as \"ultra vires\", and the special-use permit overturned as an unconstitutional violation of equal protection.\n\nSpecial land-use permits are also issued by the U.S. Forest Service for the operation of ski areas and other recreational facilities in national forests. Special-use permits have also been issued for other purposes, such as in Alaska during the summer of 2015, when special fishing permits were issued to feed firefighters who had difficulty receiving supplies via land routes due to the forest fires that they were fighting in remote areas.\n\nIn broadcasting, a restricted service licence (UK) or special temporary authority (US) may be issued by a broadcasting authority for temporary changes or set-ups for a radio station or television station. This may be for a temporary LPFM station for a special event (an RSL), or for an unexpected situation such as having to operate at low power from an emergency radio antenna or radio tower after a disaster or major equipment failure (STA).\n\n"}

He was one of the most celebrated \"Progressive\" left-wing 20th century poets of the Hindi language and was known for romanticism in his poems which were inspired by nature, people and beauty within.\n\nPant was born in Kausani village, Bageshwar District in what is now the state of Uttarakhand, into an educated middle-class Brahmin family. His mother died a few hours after childbirth, and it appears he did not seek affection from his grandmother, father, or older brother, which later influenced his writing. His father served as the manager of a local tea garden, and was also a landholder, so Pant was never in want financially growing up. He grew up in the same village and always cherished a love for the beauty and flavor of rural India, which is evident in all his major works.\n\nPant enrolled in Queens College in Banaras in 1918. There he began reading the works of Sarojini Naidu and Rabindranath Tagore, as well as English Romantic poets. These figures would all have a powerful influence on his writing. In 1919 he moved to Allahabad to study at Muir College. As an anti-British gesture he only attended for two years. He then focused more on poetry, publishing \"Pallav\" in 1926. This collection established him as a literary giant of the Hindi renaissance that had begun with Jaishankar Prasad. In the introduction to the book, Pant expressed dissatisfaction that Hindi speakers \"think in one language and express themselves in another.\" He felt that Braj was out of date and sought to help usher in a new national language.\n\nPant moved to Kalakankar in 1931. For nine years he lived an secluded life close to nature. Simultaneously he grew enamored with the works and thinking of Karl Marx and Mahatma Gandhi, dedicating several verses to them in the poetry he produced during this time. Pant went to Russia after being invited by Russian government under the impression that his poetic and intellectual prowess was being recognized while he became a tool for Russian propaganda. He was particularly chosen for his creation \"Rhapsody to Lenin\" in Hindi. The bureaucrats would get them drunk and after about fifteen days the alcohol would be withdrawn as the withdrawal would leave the subjects in a shaky position and the government would then pressure them in giving favorable statements to USSR or recruit them as informants. No guests were ever allowed in USSR without being specially selected for similar purposes. Pant returned to Almora in 1941 where he attended drama classes at the Uday Shankar Cultural Centre. He also read Aurobindo's \"The Life Divine\", which heavily influenced him. Three years later he moved to Madras and then to Pondicherry, attending Aurobindo's ashram. In 1946 he returned to Allahabad to resume his role among the country's other leading writers.\n\nHe is considered one of the major poets of the \"Chhayavaadi\" school of Hindi literature. Pant mostly wrote in Sanskritized Hindi. Pant authored twenty-eight published works including poetry, verse plays and essays.\n\nApart from \"Chhayavaadi\" poems, Pant also wrote progressive, socialist and humanist poems.\nphilosophical (influenced by Sri Aurobindo). Pant eventually moved beyond this style. As the late scholar and translator of Pant, David Rubin, writes, \"In the early forties the new psychological and experimental \"schools\" were emerging. It was typical of both Nirala and Pant that they themselves anticipated these trends and, by the time the new approaches were in vogue, they had already moved on to newer areas of experimentation.\"\n\nIn 1968, Pant became the first Hindi poet to receive the Jnanpith Award, considered to be India's highest accolade for literature. This was awarded to him for a collection of his most famous poems titled \"Chidambara\". Pant received the \"Sahitya Academy\" award, given by India's Academy of Letters, for \"Kala Aur Budhdha Chand\".\n\nThe Indian Government honored him with Padma Bhushan in 1961.\n\nSumitra Nandan Pant composed the Kulgeet of the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee \"Jayati Jayati Vidya Sansthan\".\n\nPant died on 28 December 1977, at Allahabad (Prayagraj), Uttar Pradesh, India. His childhood house in Kausani has been converted into a museum. This museum displays his daily use articles, drafts of his poems, letters, his awards, etc.\n"}

{"id": "19651530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19651530", "title": "Österreichisches Wörterbuch", "text": "Österreichisches Wörterbuch\n\nThe Österreichisches Wörterbuch (English: Austrian Dictionary), abbreviated ÖWB, is the official dictionary of the German language in the Republic of Austria. It is edited by a group of linguists under the authority of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture (\"Bundesministerium für Unterricht, Kunst und Kultur\"). It is the Austrian counterpart to the German \"Duden\" and contains a number of terms unique to Austrian German or that are more frequently used or differently pronounced there. A considerable amount of this \"Austrian\" vocabulary is also common in Southern Germany, especially Bavaria, and some of it is used in Switzerland as well. The most recent edition is the 43rd from 2017. Since the 39th edition from 2001 the orthography of the \"ÖWB\" was adjusted to the German spelling reform of 1996. This dictionary is also in official use in the Italian province of South Tyrol.\n\nThe first edition of the Austrian Dictionary was edited in 1951 on an initiative from the then Austrian minister of education Felix Hurdes. It replaced the old \"\"Regeln für die deutsche Rechtschreibung nebst Wörterbuch\", a standard work for the German orthography that dated back to pre-World War I times (1879 and 1902). The first edition had 276 pages and around 20.000 entries and was designed for use in the Austrian educational system.\n\nAt that time, only six years after World War II, Austria was still under allied administration and the Austrian civilian government tried to cut political ties to Germany, including cultural and linguistic reminiscences to the former Nazi regime. The creation of the Austrian dictionary has to be assessed under these circumstances. The annexation of Austria into Greater Germany in 1938 had also brought a unified official standard form of the German language, that was now revised by referring to pre-war Austrian standards and by including local vocabulary originating from Austro-Bavarian dialects, especially but not exclusively typical Viennese terms.\n\nThe Austrian dictionary hence defined the Austrian form of Standard German, making it official and obligatory for use in schools and in public administration. For private persons, the business correspondence of companies, publishing houses and newspapers it remained an orthographic recommendation.\n\nSince then it was republished and expanded in numerous editions, that were each published in three different versions: a reduced version for primary schools (\"Volksschule\"), a medium sized version for high schools (\"Hauptschule, Gymnasium\") and a full version for the general public. The 35th edition from 1979 was considerably expanded in the listed vocabulary and with the 39th edition from 2001 the reformed German orthography was adopted. This new standardized orthography, that was determined by an international group of experts from Germany, Switzerland and Austria, lead to considerable debates and refusal in Austria. Most newspapers switched to the reformed orthography but some later revoked their decisions and now use either the old version or a separate in-house orthography (\"Hausrechtschreibung\").\n\nThe Austrian dictionary remained with the reformed orthography, only at terms that are differently pronounced in Austria, the orthography differs from the German standard. Nevertheless the ÖWB still includes a considerable amount of unique vocabulary, that was even expanded in the newest 40th edition.\n\nThe full version of the 2006 40th edition contains around 80,000 terms on 1,008 pages. The school version is 864 pages, and the small version has 20,000 terms. The authors of this edition were the linguists Otto Back, Erich Benedikt, Karl Blüml, Jakob Ebner and Hermann Möcker from the institute of Austrian studies (\"Institut für Österreichkunde\"), as well as the dialectogists Maria Hornung, Professor Heinz Dieter Pohl from the University of Klagenfurt and Emeritus professor Herbert Tatzreiter from the University of Vienna.\n\nAbout 3,000 new terms were added to the 39th edition, among them Austrian neologisms such as „\"E-Card\"“ for the Austrian social security card, „\"Hacklerregelung\"“, a legal term for a special retirement law, and „\"Pensionsharmonisierung\"“. From the colloquial vocabulary new terms were added such as „\"Altenbetreuer\"“ (geriatric nurse), „\"anzipfen\"“ (to get fed up), „\"ablösefrei\"“ (without transfer fee), „\"Audiobook\"“, „\"Afro-Look\"“ und „\"Alkopops\"“ (soft drink with liquor). New technological terms were also added, like: „\"skypen\"“, „\"VoIP\"“, „\"Blog\"“, „\"Linux\"“ and even „\"Wikipedia\"“.\n\nNew terms might differ from their counterparts in Germany. The Austrian dictionary now sets the term „\"smsen\"“ (to text message, pronounced as-am-as-an) as standard, whereas the Duden uses „\"simsen\"“, both derived from the English abbreviation „\"SMS\"“ for \"short message service\"\".\n\nNumerous outdated word were removed from the 40th edition, either because their reference in the real world ceased to exist or because they became out of fashion. Examples are „\"Absperrkommando\"“, „\"affengeil\"“ und „\"Arbeitermittelschule\"“. However the terms „\"Schilling\"“ and „\"Gendarmerie\"“ are listed, although their signifiants no longer exist. Still included are some typical dialect terms, that continue to be used in the written language, such as the Carinthian „\"Strankerl\"“ (common beans) or the word „\"Zöger\"“ bzw. „\"Zeger\"“ for a wicker basket.\n\nOther typically Austrian words in the dictionary are for example: „\"Dulliähstimmung\"“ (drunkenness), „\"Greißler\"“ (grocery shop), „\"Gwirkst\"“ (complicated situation), „\"Jausengegner\"“ (easy opponent in sports), „\"Käsekrainer\"“ (a Kranjska klobasa), „\"klass\"“ (terrific), „\"Outwachler\"“ (a linesman), „\"Pfusch\"“ (moonlighting), „\"pipifein\"“ (fine), „\"Roadpricing\"“, „\"Stockerlplatz\"“ (a medal rank in sports), „\"Szenebeisl\"“ (a hip nightclub), „\"tschechern\"“ (to booze), „\"zach\"“ (chewy, tough) and „\"zerknautschen\"“ (to crumple).\n\nSome parents protested against the 39th edition, arguing that there were too many \"dirty words\" listed, some of which have subsequently been removed from the school version of the 40th edition.\n\nThe objective of the Austrian dictionary has never been to do classical language planning, but to do a re-codification of the form of the German language used in Austria. New terms were only included to the dictionary, when they had already been in considerable use in newspapers and contemporary literature.\n\nAlthough the dictionary was originally designed to promote Austrianism and language patriotism, throughout the years the dictionary commission followed a moderate policy of contrastive linguistics and tried to avoid language secessionism. Nevertheless in the case of conflicting definitions the Austrian dictionary overrules the Duden and remains the sole source for defining the Austrian standard. In post-World War II Austria the German Duden never had any legal authority, although informally it is also widely in use as a work of reference.\n\n\n\n"}
