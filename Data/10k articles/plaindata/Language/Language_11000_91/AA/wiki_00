{"id": "468550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=468550", "title": "Anglicism", "text": "Anglicism\n\nAn Anglicism is a word or construction borrowed from English into another language.\n\nWith the rise in Anglophone media and global spread of British and American cultures in the 20th and 21st centuries, many English terms have entered popular usage in other tongues. Technology-related English words like \"internet\" and \"computer\" are particularly common across the globe, as there are no pre-existing words for them. English words are sometimes imported verbatim, and sometimes adapted to the importing language in a process similar to anglicisation. In languages with non-Latin alphabets, these borrowed words can be written in the Latin alphabet anyway, resulting in a text made up of a mixture of scripts; other times they are transliterated. Transliteration of English and other foreign words into Japanese generally uses the katakana script.\n\nIn some countries such anglicisation is seen as relatively benign, and the use of English words may even take on a \"chic\" aspect. In Japan, marketing products for the domestic market often involves using English or pseudo-English brand names and slogans. In other countries, anglicisation is seen much more negatively, and there are efforts by public-interest groups and governments to reverse the trend; for example, the Académie française in France insists on the use of French neologisms to describe technological inventions in place of imported English terms.\n\nIt is also important to note that while Anglicism is fundamentally rooted in the word English, the process does not necessarily denote anglicisms from England. It can also involve terms or words from all varieties of English so that it becomes necessary to use the term Americanism for the loan words originating from the United States.\n\nA number of scholars agree that in order for Anglicism to take place, adaptation must first occur such as in the case of the integration of a great number of Anglicisms in Europe. Fischer said that it is similar to neologism in the sense that it completes several phases of integration, which include: 1) the beginning, when it is still new and not known to many speakers; 2) the phase where it begins to spread and take part in the process of institutionalization; and, 3) the word becomes part of the common core of the language. There are experts who propose a more detailed framework such as the model of Anglicism adaptation that transpires on four levels: orthographic, phonological, morphological, and semantic.\n\nThese are English terms, expressions, or concepts that have been absorbed into the Chinese language, including any of its varieties, and should not be confused with Chinglish, the variety of the English language used by native Chinese speakers.\n\nThe origins of Chinese anglicisms vary, one of the most common being those obtained by phonetic borrowing. For example, a \"bus\" (, in Mainland China or Taiwan) is usually called in Hong Kong and Macao because its Cantonese pronunciation is similar to its English counterpart. Another type of anglicism is syntactic anglicism, when a sentence is rendered following the English word order instead of the standard Chinese word order; for example, the word for \"network\" is or , where can be translated as \"net\".\nA distinction is made between well-established English borrowings into French, and other words and structures regarded as incorrect. The term \"anglicisme\" is often pejorative, carries a large amount of political weight, and frequently denotes an excessive use of English in the French language.\n\nThere are many words in French of English origin whose English roots are unknown or unrecognized due to lack of salience or length of time since borrowing (ex: \"gouvernement\"), as well as other words which are seen as English but that are well accepted as part of French (ex: \"parking\", \"week-end\"). Other examples include \"clown\" (pronounced \"kloon\"), \"square\" (meaning \"public square\") or \"spleen\" (meaning \"melancholy\" rather than the organ). These are not considered Anglicisms but are fully accepted as French words by the Académie française.\n\nOccasionally governments and linguistic institutions of both Quebec and France have undertaken strenuous efforts to eradicate Anglicisms, often by suggesting French replacements with French phonology and morphology. Although efforts in Quebec have been met with some success (ex: \"fin de semaine\" for week-end), attempts by the Académie française have largely been unsuccessful. Sociolinguists have attributed these failures to the general inability of linguistic institutions to enforce a linguistic norm. The Académie française regularly updates a list of prescribed linguistic norms, many of which include using suggested French replacements instead of anglicisms (ex: \"mot-dièse\" for \"hashtag\").\n\nReplacements have taken many different forms. For example, in Quebec the portmanteau word \"clavardage\" is increasingly gaining acceptance. This neologism is a word coined from the words \"clavier\" (\"keyboard\") and \"bavardage\" (\"chat\"). Other replacements have various forms created by the academy and Quebecois linguistic institutions.\n\nQuebec French and European French tend to have entirely different Anglicisms for historical reasons. Quebec French acquired its Anglicisms in a gradual process of linguistic borrowing resulting from linguistic contact with English speakers for two and a half centuries since the Battle of the Plains of Abraham of 1759. European French, on the other hand, mostly adopted its Anglicisms in recent decades due to the post-Second World War international dominance of English, or the rise of English as a lingua franca. Due to the differences between in English borrowings in Canada and France, the people of Quebec and France often consider each other's anglicisms to be incorrect or humorous while considering their own to be perfectly normal.\n\nAn example of a European French Anglicism not used in Quebec:\nAn example of a Quebec French Anglicism not used in France;\n\nFurthermore, the social meaning and acceptance of anglicisms differs from country to country due to the differences in the historical relationship to French. In Quebec, anglicisms are never used in formal documentation (government papers, instruction sheets) and very rarely used in informal writing (magazines, journals). In 1993, the French passed the legislation Loi Toubon which forbids the use of anglicisms (or those from other languages) in common publications. In both countries, wherever the use of an Anglicism is unavoidable, it is often written in italics or in quotations.\n\nThere are a number of different varieties of anglicisms which are largely differentiated on the way in which they entered the language. One type of anglicism is a calque, or a direct translation from English. For example, the valediction \"Sincèrement vôtre\" is regarded as an anglicism since it is a direct translation of the English \"Sincerely yours.\" Other anglicisms include the wholesale adoption of the English term such as \"business\" or \"start-up\". Additionally, some English words in French may not have the same meaning as those words in English. One example is the word \"golf\" which has an increased semantic field, referring to not just the game of golf but also a golf course as in \"on va aller au golf\" (trans: we're going to the golf course).\n\nIt must be noted that anglicism is a political term and does not necessarily indicate the etymology or history of the word itself. Rather, it indicates the common attitudes and perceptions about the (theoretically English) history of the word. For example, because English itself borrowed a great amount of French vocabulary after the Norman Conquest, some anglicisms are actually Old French words that dropped from usage in French over the centuries but were preserved in English and have now come full circle back into French. For instance, one attested origin of the verb \"to flirt\" cites influence from the Old French expression \"conter fleurette\", which means \"to (try to) seduce\". (Other possible origins for the word include \"flit\", E. Frisian \"flirt\" (a flick or light stroke) and E. Frisian \"flirtje\" (a giddy girl)). This expression is no longer used in French, but the English Gallicism \"to flirt\" has now returned to French and is considered an anglicism, despite its likely French origins.\n\nDenglisch (German spelling) or Denglish (English spelling) is a portmanteau of \"Deutsch\" and \"Englisch\" (the German words for the German and English languages). The term is used in all German-speaking countries to refer to the increasingly strong influx of English or pseudo-English vocabulary into German. Denglish is also used to refer to incorrect English that is influenced by German.\nTo some extent, the influence of English on German can be from normal language contact. The term Denglisch is however mostly reserved for forced, excessive exercises in anglicization, or pseudo-anglicization, of the German language.\n\nThe first anglicisisms in the written sources of Latvian appear at the end of the 18th century, however, up until the middle 1970s they were barely researched as their number remained low and since they mostly appeared in the terminology of sports and engineering. The direct contact between Latvian and English at that time was very limited, thus most of the anglicisms entered Latvian through German or Russian. Ever since Latvia regained its independence, there has been an influx of anglicisms into the Latvian language due to the fact that media in English is more accessible than ever.\n\nSporadic linguistic contacts between Polish and English-speaking areas have been noted at least since the 15th century. However, most early Anglicisms in Polish were mostly limited to names for places in Great Britain and the Americas. The first proper Anglicisms were also related to geography and were recorded in an 18th-century work \"Geografia, czyli opisanie naturalne, historyczne i praktyczne krajów we czterech częściach się zawierające\" by Franciszek Siarczyński. By the end of that century there were at least 21 lexemes of English provenance in Polish usage. The 1859 dictionary of foreign words by Michał Amszejewicz contains roughly 100 Anglicisms, the so-called Vilnian dictionary of 1861 contains roughly 180 of such words. The Anglicisms recorded in the 19th century were in large part words related to social, political, legal and economic concepts used in English society and lacking corresponding institutions in contemporary Poland. Another group were naval, sports-related and technical terms.\n\nTypically new words were initially being written in their original form, especially when they were used to describe English or American contexts. Such was the case of the word \"budget\", first recorded as such in 1792 in relation to English economy, but soon also used in Polish context. With time the word was assimilated and remains in modern Polish dictionaries, written as \"budżet\". Early 19th century Dictionary of the Polish Language by Samuel Linde includes the following Anglicisms: foksal (after London's suburb of Vauxhall; meaning an evening garden party in contemporary Polish), galon, klub, kwakier, piknik, poncz, rum and porter.\n\nThe assimilation of new English words into Polish sped up in the 20th century and gradually English replaced Czech, German, French, Italian and other languages as the primary source of new imports into the Polish language. At the turn of the century there were roughly 250 English words in use, by 1961 the number of English lexemes in Polish rose to over 700, breaking 1000 lexemes in the 1980s and at least 1600 in 1994.\n\nBorrowings from English language used in modern Polish fall into a number of thematic categories:\n\nTake note, that some of the borrowed words already have Polish equivalents and therefore are not recognized by all language users:\n\"menadżer\" (manager) instead of \"kierownik\"\n\"quad\" (quad bike) instead of \"czterokołowiec\"\n\"monitoring\" (CCTV) instead of \"nadzór\", \"dozór\"\n\"W czym mogę pomóc\" (English: How can I help you) instead of \"Czym mogę służyć\" (English: How can I serve you).\n\nIn addition to lexical borrowings, there is also a number of calques in everyday use.\n\nUnder Benito Mussolini, efforts were made to purify Italian of Anglicisms and other foreign words. Today, Italian is one of the most receptive languages for anglicisms.\n\nThe Hispanisation of English words is fairly common in the United States and even in Latin America. In Spain, the adoption of English words is extremely common in the spheres of business and information technology, although it is usually frowned upon by purists.\n\nThere are a lot of Anglicisms in Ukrainian language which are from many sides of human life.\n\n\"Техніка:\" блюмінг (blooming), бульдозер (bulldozer), буфер (buffer), грейдер (grader), диспетчер (dispatcher), дисплей (display), ескалатор (escalator), каупер (cowper stove), комбайн (combine), комп'ютер (computer), конвеєр (conveyor), крекінг (cracking), принтер (printer), радар (radar), слябінг (slabbing), сейф (safe), телетайп (teletype), тендер (tender), трактор (tractor), трамвай (tramway), тунель (tunnel), файл (file), фільм (film), хонінгування (honing).\n\n\"Мореплавство, військова справа:\" браунінг (Browning), бункер (bunker), ватерлінія (waterline), снайпер (sniper), танк (tank), танкер (tanker), траулер (trawler), шквал (squall), шрапнель (shrapnel), шхуна (schooner), яхта (yacht).\n\n\"Політика (politics), економіка (economy), торгівля:\" банкнота (banknote), бізнес (business), блеф (bluff), блокада (blockade), бойкот (boycott), бос (boss), бюджет (budget), гангстер (gangster), демпінг (dumping), долар (dollar), інтерв'ю (interview), лідер (leader), локаут (lockout), маркетинг (marketing), менеджер (manager), менеджмент (management), мітинг (meeting), рекет (racket), трест (trust), чек (check).\n\n\"Спорт (sport):\" аут (out), бокс (box), боксер (boxer), ватерполо (waterpolo), волейбол (volleyball), гол (goal), голкіпер (goalkeeper), матч (match), жокей (jockey), нокаут (knockout), раунд (round), рекорд (record), спаринг (sparring), спорт (sport), спортсмен (sportsman), старт (start), теніс (tennis), трек (track), тренер (trainer), фініш (finish), форвард (forward), футбол (football), хокей (hockey).\n\n\"Одяг, тканини:\" вельвет (velvet), джемпер (jumper), піжама (pyjama), плед (plaid), плюш (plush), смокінг (smoking jacket/tuxedo).\n\n\"Їжа, напої:\" біфштекс (beef steak), кекс (cakes), пудинг (pudding), пунш (punch), ром (rum), ростбіф (roast beef), сандвіч (sandwich).\n\n\"Культура (culture):\" гумор (humor), джаз (jazz), клоун (clown), клуб (club), комфорт (comfort), памфлет (pamphlet), сквер (square), тент (tent), фокстрот (foxtrot), фольклор (folklore), хол (hall).\n\nThe Anglicisms can be divided to four types: direct phonetic imitation, lexical and grammatical calques, and contamination of orthography. Official language (as given by the Language Planning Office) deprecates Anglicisms, and for the most part, native constructions are sufficient even in spoken language. Nevertheless, some Anglicisms creep in.\n\nComputer jargon is generally full of direct imitation, e.g. \"svappi\" \"swap\". Other jargons with abundant Anglicisms are pop music, scifi, gaming, fashion, automobile and to some extent scientific jargon. This is regarded a sign of overspecialization, if used outside the context of the jargon. Generally, direct imitation is not as common, but there are examples. For example, the word \"sexy\" [seksy], pronounced with an Y unlike in English [seksi], might be used as an adjective. This is teenager-specific.\n\nLexical calques take an English expression, like \"killer application\", and produce \"tappajasovellus\", which does mean \"an application that kills\" just as in English. You will need to know the equivalent English term to understand this.\n\nSome speakers, especially those in frequent contact with the English language have created a grammatical calque of the English \"you\"-impersonal. The English impersonal utilizes the second person pronoun \"you\", e.g. \"You can't live if you don't eat\". Here, the word \"you\" does not refer explicitly to the listener, but signifies a general statement. The same example is rendered in Finnish as \"Syömättä ei elä\", where a separate grammatical impersonal (also known as \"passiivi\") is used. When translated word-by-word, \"Sä et elä jos sä et syö\", it will refer directly to the listener. Here the contraction \"sä\" of spoken language is used instead of the \"sinä\" of spoken language. Then, \"you\" will need to understand that it is an Anglicism, or \"you\" can be offended by the commanding \"You there!\" tone produced. (There are also native examples of the same construction, so the origin of this piece of grammar may not always be English.)\n\nAn English orthographical convention is that compound words are written separately, whereas in Finnish, compound words are written together, using a hyphen with acronyms and numbers. In Finnish, \"prosessitekniikka\" and \"Intel 80286 -prosessori\" would be correct, but \"process engineering\" or \"Intel 80286 processor\" would not. Failure to join the words or omitting the hyphen can be either an honest mistake, or contamination from English.\n\nAnother orthographical convention is that English words tend to be written as the originals. For example, the computer jargon term from \"to chat\" is written as \"chattailla\" (chat + frequentative), even if it is pronounced \"sättäillä\". The forms \"chattäillä\" or \"chättäillä\" are used, too. Sometimes, it is even standard language, e.g. \"sherry\" , instead of according to English pronunciation \"šeri\" .\n\nOther definitions of Anglicism include: a word or construction peculiar to English; a word or phrase that is peculiar to British English; or English syntax, grammar, or meaning transposed in another language resulting in incorrect language use or incorrect translation.\n\nIn the context of Interlingua, an Anglicism is a uniquely English expression used when speaking or writing Interlingua. Many English expressions have penetrated into a wide variety of languages, making them good Interlingua expressions. Novice speakers sometimes assume that an English expression is correct Interlingua when in fact it is not sufficiently international. For example, a novice may use \"Lassa nos considerar le optiones\" to mean 'Let's consider the options', as in English. In Interlingua, however, this expression means 'Permit us to consider the options'. A more international expression is \"Que nos considera le optiones\", literally 'That we consider the options'.\n\n\n"}

She serves as the Josephine Knotts Knowles Professor in Human Biology at Stanford University and has been described as \"the leading researcher in infant-directed speech\".\nFernald received a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Oregon in 1982, where she studied under the mentorship of Patricia K. Kuhl. As well as her position as a psychology professor, Fernald has taken an administrative role at Stanford as Vice Provost for Faculty Development. She also serves on the advisory board for a California-based company VersaMe which focuses on early childhood education and was partially inspired by Fernald's research. Her husband, Russell Fernald, is the Benjamin Scott Crocker Professor in Human Biology at Stanford.\nFernald specializes in children's language development, investigating the development of speed and efficiency in children's early comprehension in relation to their emerging lexical and grammatical competence. Recently, she has also begun to study language development in bilingual Spanish-English speaking children and children who are learning Spanish in addition to English. \nHer research has shown that infants prefer baby talk to adult speech and that it plays an important role in their language development, and that baby talk has universal features that span multiple cultures and languages. She has also studied the effects of television on infants, showing that young TV viewers echo the emotional responses of the actors they see.\n\nOne of the studies Fernald focused on was the effect of Socioeconomic Status on language processing skills and vocabulary. Socioeconomic status in this study were based upon the education level of each parents, occupation of each parent, and income. She focused on children between the ages of eighteen months to twenty-four months. In the beginning of her study, she found that at the start the children did not seem to have a difference in skills and vocabulary, but at twenty-four months they had an approximate six month gap. Her research contributed to the debates during the Civil Rights Movement, when the question was raised of if there was truly inequalities in education between Black and White schools. In her research she found that socioeconomic status does affect the way that children develop language, these factors include: childcare and amount of time spent with the child. In Fernald’s research, she found that Socioeconomic status does matter, but the quantity and quality of interactions with children. Fernald’s research contributed to language acquisition and also helped illustrate that there are many factors that go into how a child develops their repertoire in vocabulary.\n\nAnne Fernald and Adriana Weisleder produced the current study to answer the question: “Is early experience with language linked to the development of efficiency in language processing, and if so, differences in processing efficiency mediate the well established relation between early language experience and later vocabulary knowledge?” To answer these questions, Weisleder and Fernald gathered 29 Spanish-learning infants who were all typically developing according to their parents. The families that participated consisted of low-income Latino families. Fernald made audio recordings of the infants throughout the child's typical days and their interaction with their parents. The parents of were also asked to keep a log of their children which contained recordings of their interactions as well. Regarding measures of expressive vocabulary, parents collected productive vocabulary scores. Language processing efficiency was measured by presenting infants with pairs of images while hearing sentences containing one of the words. The children were also tested on child-directed speech, which is a change in tone of voice when speaking to a child the. Fernald discovered that a variety of adult-speech was found to be accessible to children in the low-income families. A main point to be aware of includes the variation between low-income Spanish speaking families and child-directed speech and its predicted effects on vocabulary. Also, learned vocabulary occurred only when speech was directed at the infant rather than in an an adult conversation. These findings conclude that the efficiency of speech processing does facilitate child directed speech and its relation to vocabulary.\n\nFernald also studied to see if the pitch and tone in adults voices when talking to infants makes a difference when it comes to intent of the communication. Several different tests were used to determine whether or not what she was researching had any validity to it at all. The tests started out by using 80 participants, 20 mothers and 20 fathers of children between 10-14 months old and then 20 female and 20 male college students that had no direct experience with infants or kids past the age of 5. Fernald's tests had 5 natural samples of infant and adult directed speech recorded from mothers of 12 month old kids in 5 standardized interactional contexts: Attention-bid, Approval, Prohibition, Comfort, and Game/telephone. They then got 25 infant directed and 25 adult directed vocalizations that were electronically filtered to eliminate linguistic content. They then had the 80 subjects listen to these content filtered speech acts and tried to identify the intent of the speaker by only using the “prosodic” information or the pitch and tone. The subjects were able to tell the intent of the infant directed speech way more frequently than that of adult directed speech. What this was able to show is that the pitch of infant directed speech is more informative than adult directed speech and this is beneficial for preverbal infants. Fernald was ultimately able to contribute more information on how the patterns of child directed speech are beneficial to children's understanding of speech intent.\n\nOne of Fernald's studies analyze how infants perceive different emotions through television. One simulation included, infants observing actors on a tv express negative and positive emotions when playing with certain toys. This study answered the question of whether a 10-12 month old baby will emote the same reactions towards a toy as the actors seen on a televised series did and if it will dictate the same emotion towards a toy. Once the infants were done watching they were then presented with the same objects and had 30 seconds to encode and react. When the infant was presented with the toy that the actor had negative emotions towards, the infant associated the same toy with negative emotions as well and resulted in the infant disengaging. This same procedure was done again but with the toy that the actor reacted positively to and again the baby corresponded the positive emotions with the toy and reacted positively towards within the 30 seconds. This simulation proves Fernald’s question to be true. She found that infants are able to interpret and encode the same emotions that are displayed on a televised screen. This is just one of the many ways an infant picks up on social-referencing. Social referencing is the process in which a child relies on social cues in a certain context to relay the correct reaction. This method efficiently examines if and how an infant encodes certain emotions towards certain objects from a stranger on television.\n\n"}

All four Gospels in one volume were published in Kazan by Pravoslavnoe Missionerskoe Obshchestvo in 1901. This may be related to the edition of Mark previously published in Kazan, or could be the same as I. Katerinski's translation, listed in \"Book of a Thousand Tongues\" as Kirghiz.\n\nMildred Cable's biography of George Hunter just says \"a Qazaq speaking Russian\". This version is printed in a Cyrillic script, slightly different from what Qazaqs use today; this script has a lot of Russian/Greek words in it, and uses Russian/Greek names, instead of Qazaq/Islamic ones. The 1901 work was republished in 1972 by the Institute for Bible Translation in Stockholm, Sweden. \n\nGeorge W. Hunter of the China Inland Mission was aware of the Kazan 1901 translation, and after much prayer that he would be able to get a copy of it, a man approached him in the bazaar offering to exchange it (a book he could not read) for one that he could. Hunter revised these translations and transliterated them into Arabic. He also translated Genesis and Acts.\n\nActs, Mark, and a tentative edition of Matthew was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society/China Inland Mission in \"Tihwafu\" (Ürümqi) in 1917. A 2nd edition, (new ed. of the 1917 translation by G. W. Hunter) of Mark was published in Shanghai in 1918. A 2nd edition (new ed. of the 1917 translation by G. W. Hunter) of Acts was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in Shanghai in 1919. All four Gospels were published again by the British and Foreign Bible Society in Shanghai in 1927, and again in 1928. The Shanghai BFBS also published Genesis in 1931. There may have also been other parts of the Bible translated by G. W. Hunter, but they are lost, as is record of them.\n\nA modern translation of the entire Kazak Bible was published by Yeni Yaşam Yayınları in 2010 in Istanbul.\n\nIn 2011, Jehovah's Witnesses published \"Мәсіхшілердің грек жазбалары. Жаңа дүние аудармасы\" (\"New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures\") in Kazakh; the complete \"New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures\" in Kazakh was released in September 2014.\n\nIn 2015 the Kazakh Bible Society published a new translation of the Bible in two variants: a study Bible and a plain text Bible. \n\n"}

{"id": "434805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=434805", "title": "Eloquence", "text": "Eloquence\n\nEloquence (from French \"eloquence\" from Latin \"eloquentia\") is fluent, forcible, elegant or persuasive speaking. It is primarily the power of expressing strong emotions in striking and appropriate language, thereby producing conviction or persuasion. The term is also used for writing in a fluent style.\n\nThe concept of eloquence dates to the ancient Greeks, Calliope (one of the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne) being the Muse of epic poetry and eloquence. The Greek god Hermes was patron of eloquence.\nCicero is considered as one of the most eloquent orators of Antiquity. Fr. Louis Bourdaloue is regarded as one of the founders of French eloquence.\nEloquence derives from the Latin roots: \"ē\" (a shortened form of the preposition \"ex\"), meaning \"out (of)\", and \"loqui\", a deponent verb meaning \"to speak\". Thus, being eloquent is having the ability to project words fluidly out of the mouth and the ability to understand and command the language in such a way that one employs a graceful style coupled with the power of persuasion, or just being extremely graceful in the interpretation of communication. \nPetrarch (Fracesco Petrarca), in his study program of the classics and antiquity (Italian Renaissance) focused attention on language and communication. After mastering language, the goal was to reach a \"level of eloquence\", to be able to present gracefully, combine thought and reason in a powerful way, so as to persuade others to a point of view. Petrarch encouraged students to imitate the ancient writers, from a language perspective, combining clear and correct speech with moral thought. The Renaissance humanists focused on the correlation of speech and political principles as a powerful tool to present and persuade others to particular concepts. At the core of presentations was the use of graceful style, clear concise grammar and usage, and over time the insertion of rational and emotional arguments.\n\nIn modern times, colloquial speech entered into presentation styles deemed eloquent.\n\nEloquence is both a natural talent and improved by knowledge of language, study of a specific subject to be addressed, philosophy, rationale and ability to form a persuasive set of tenets within a presentation.\n\n\"True eloquence,\" Oliver Goldsmith says, \"Does not consist ... in saying great things in a sublime style, but in a simple style; for there is, properly speaking, no such thing as a sublime style, the sublimity lies only in the things; and when they are not so, the language may be turgid, affected, metaphorical, but not affecting.\"\n\nPoliticians are often termed eloquent. Marcus Antonius, c. 83–30 BCE, Roman politician and soldier gave one of the most memorable speeches in history, dramatized by William Shakespeare in the play Julius Caesar; Shakespeare used Antonius's famous opening line \"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears\".\n\nMany famous political leaders, from Pericles to Winston Churchill, and dictators such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, rose to prominence in large part due to their eloquence. In the Iranian Revolution, Ruhollah Khomeini came to power in part through the eloquence of his speeches, smuggled into the country on audio cassettes while he was still in exile. . In recent times, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi can also be termed as eloquent., \n\n\n\n"}

The stories may be edited for consistency, and sometimes new connecting material, such as a frame story or other interstitial narration, is written for the new work. The term was coined by the science fiction writer A. E. van Vogt, who published several fix-ups of his own, including \"The Voyage of the Space Beagle\", but the practice (if not the term) exists outside of science fiction. The use of the term in science fiction criticism was popularised by the first (1979) edition of the \"Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\", edited by Peter Nicholls, which credited Van Vogt with the creation of the term.\nThe name comes from the modifications that the author needs to make in the original texts to make them fit together as though they were a novel. Foreshadowing of events from the later stories may be jammed into an early chapter of the fix-up, and character development may be interleaved throughout the book. Contradictions and inconsistencies between episodes are usually worked out.\n\nSome fix-ups in their final form are more of a short story cycle or composite novel rather than a traditional novel with a single main plotline. Examples are Ray Bradbury's \"The Martian Chronicles\" and Isaac Asimov's \"I, Robot\", both of which read as a series of short stories which may share plot threads and characters but which still act as self-contained stories. By contrast, van Vogt's \"The Weapon Shops of Isher\" is structured like a continuous novel although it incorporates material from three previous Van Vogt short stories.\n\nFix-ups became an accepted practice in the 1950s, when science fiction and fantasy—once published only in magazines—began appearing in book form. Large book publishers like Doubleday and Simon & Schuster entered the market, greatly increasing demand for fiction. Authors created new manuscripts from old stories to sell to publishers. Algis Budrys in 1965 described fixups as a consequence of the lack of good supply during the \"bad years for quality\" of the mid-1950s, although citing \"The Martian Chronicles\" and Clifford D. Simak's \"City\" as among exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

He is believed to have been born in the early part of 8th century. He was the Chief Disciple of the Sri Sivaratna Giri Swamigal and one of the leaders (Peetathipathis) of the Jyotir Math, one of the four Maths established by Adi Sankara. This lineage of Peetathipathis is also called the 'Giri' Paramparai, as seen from the Peetathipathis' name which ends with 'Giri'. Gnanananda is a Mahayogi, Siddha Purusha, Himalayan sage and Indian philosopher. He believed in Advaita Vedanta because of his lineage. He had a number of disciples including Vidyananda, Triveni and Dasagiri. He gave sanyasa to Haridhos Giriof Adi Shankara. He also made him chief disciple at Gnananda Tapovanam circa 1960s commanding him to spread nama sankirtana through the world. Swami had a number of accomplished disciples through his abnormally long tenure- Bramanamda who took samadhi at Puskar, Achutadasa of Polur. He loved obsurity. He changed identity to avoid being recognised .\n\nSources report his birth as early 19th century in the village Mangalapuri in North Kanara District of Karnataka. to an orthodox Brahmin couple, Venkoba Ganapati and SriMathi Sakku Bai. He was named \"Subramanyam\" at birth, and left his home at a very early age. His birthday is celebrated on the birth star of \"Kritika\" in January (the Tamil month of \"Thai\").\n\nSivaratna Giri Swami accepted Subramanyam as his disciple and named him \"Pragnana Brahmachari\". Sivaratna Giri initiated Gnanananda in the traditional manner into the \"Giri\" order of Jyotir Mutt and gave him the monastic name of \"Sri Gnanananda Giri\". Sivaratna Gnanananda adorned the 6th lineage of Peetam of Jagadguru Totakacharya for some time. However he nominated one Ananda Giri in his place and retired to the height of the Himalayas for penance. Gnananda spent many years at the sacred spot of Gangotri and icy caves of the Himalayas in intense \"tapas\". He travelled extensively on foot, spanning the whole India and Tibet, Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka and Malaya. He met many holy men over the course of his pilgrimage.\n\nGnanananda returned to India and established an ashram at Attayampatti in Salem and then at Siddhalingamadam near Villupuram. The most famous ashram, named \"Sri Gnanananda Tapovanam\", is situated two miles away from Tirukkoyilur. Gnanananda built temples for the deities of Gnanaganesa, Gnanaskandan, Gananapurisa, Gnanambika, Mahalaksmi, Gnana Venugopala, Gnana Bhairavar and Gnana AnjaneyanShiva in Tapovanam. Another ashram was constructed in Yercaud, a hill station near Salem. It was called \"Pranavanilayam\". This was a retreat for contemplatives. Giri wanted to develop it as a centre for comparative religion. In contrast to Tapovanam, no rituals were permitted in Yercaud. The central emphasis was on meditation and dhyana.\n\nGiri taught a number of paths based on the aptitude of his disciples. Therefore, some of disciples are conversant in the \"path of knowledge\" (jñāna-marga) while others are the \"path of works\" (karma-marga) and still others follow the \"path of faith\" (bhakti-marga). His senior monastic disciple Vidyananda Giri was a profound scholar and linguist and brought out Tamil translations of Shankara's commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads. He also made available Tamil versions of famous Advaitic texts like \"Sanatsujatiyam\". He trained followers in Advaitic Nidhidhyasana. Another of his lineage, Satyananda was associated with Franklin Merrell-Wolff and taught his method of \"introceptive knowledge\".\n\nGiri realised that the path of Vichara and Nidhidhyasana was confined to a few philosophically advanced aspirants. For devotees at a lesser level, he advocated stuti, japa and nama sankirtan.\nHe was well versed in all the modes of Bhajana Sampradaya and he held that Hari Bhajana for ordinary devotees was the easiest way to attain \"Moksha\".\nHe had chosen Haridas Giri propagated the importance of Namasankeetanam.\nGnanananda had initiated (given sanyasa) to Hari, the son of Nat Anna Rao. The boy later became known as \"Swami Haridhos Giri\" on being initiated in sanyasa. Haridhos carried his guru's (Gnianananda's) sandals (Paadhuka) with him to all the holy places he went to. He also visited many holy places with his Guru Paadhuka to propagate the importance of singing god's praises (\"NamaSankeerthanam\") as instructed by his guru. As part of spreading the cult of Namasankeerthanam, Giri established Mandalis and Samajams in various countries.\n\nSadguru has indicated to his devotees that he will attain samadhi in a few days. Accordingly, Sadguru Sri Gnananadhagiri Swamigal went into permanent samadhi status on 7 January 1974 around 3:30 a.m. His devotees waited for three days in the hope that Swami will come out of his Samadhi status. After consulting Kanchi Mahaswaamigal and Poondi Mahan who confirmed that Sadguru Swami Gnanananda Giri Swamigal has attained \"NIRVIKALPA SAMADHI\" his body was put inside a pit on 10 January 1974 around 6:30 pm and the present adhistanam was constructed.\n\n"}

{"id": "471293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=471293", "title": "Haitian Creole", "text": "Haitian Creole\n\nHaitian Creole (; , ; ) is a French-based creole language spoken by 10–12million people worldwide, and the only language of most Haitians. It is a creole language based largely on 18th century French with influences from Portuguese, Spanish, English, Taíno, and West African languages. Haitian Creole emerged from contact between French settlers and African slaves during the Atlantic slave trade in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). Haitians are the largest creole-speaking community in the world.\n\nThe usage of and education in Haitian Creole—which is not mutually intelligible with French—has been contentious since at least the 19thcentury: where some Haitians saw French as a legacy of colonialism, Creole was maligned by francophone elites as a miseducated or poor person’s French. Until the late 20thcentury, Haitian presidents spoke only French to their fellow citizens, and until the 2000s, all instruction at Haitian elementary schools was in French, a foreign language to most of the students.\nThe word \"creole\" is of Latin origin via a Portuguese term that means \"a person (especially a servant) raised in one's house\". It first referred to Europeans born and raised in overseas colonies, but later was used to refer to the language as well.\n\nHaitian Creole contains elements from both the Romance group of Indo-European languages through its superstratum French language, as well as African languages. There are many theories on the formation of the Haitian Creole language.\n\nOne theory estimates that Haitian Creole developed between 1680 and 1740. During the 16th and 17th centuries, French and Spanish colonizers produced tobacco, cotton, and sugar on the island. Throughout this period, the population was made up of roughly equal numbers of \"engagés\" (employed whites), \"gens de couleur\" and slaves. Singler estimates the economy shifted into sugar production in 1690, just prior to the official formation of the French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1697. The sugar crops required a much larger labor force which lead to an increase in slave importation. In the 18th century an estimated 800,000 West-African individuals were enslaved and brought to Saint-Domingue. As the slave population increased, interactions between French-speaking colonists and slaves decreased.  \n\nMany African slaves in French ownership were from the Niger-Congo territory and particularly from Kwa languages such as Gbe and the Central Tano languages and Bantu languages. Singler suggests that the number of Bantu speakers decreased while the number of Kwa speakers increased, with Gbe being the most dominant group. The first fifty years of 's sugar boom coincided with the Gbe predominance in the French Caribbean. During the time Singler places the evolution of the language, the Gbe population was 50% of the imported slave population.\n\nIn contrast to the African languages, a type of classical French (\"\") and (Norman, and dialects, Gallo and Picard) were spoken during the 17th and 18th centuries in , as well as in New France and French West Africa. Slaves who seldom could communicate with fellow slaves would try to learn French. With the constant importation of slaves, the language gradually became formalized and became a distinct tongue to French. The language was also picked up by the whites and became used by all those born in what is now Haiti.\n\nHaitian Creole and French have similar pronunciations and share many lexical items. In fact, over 90% of the Haitian Creole vocabulary is of French origin. However, many cognate terms actually have different meanings. For example, as Valdman mentions in \"Haitian Creole: Structure, Variation, Status, Origin\", the word for \"frequent\" in French is ; however, its cognate in Haitian Creole means 'insolent, rude, and impertinent' and usually refers to people. In addition, the grammars of Haitian Creole and French are significantly different. For example, in Haitian Creole, verbs are not conjugated as they are in French.\n\nBoth Haitian Creole and French have also experienced semantic change; words that had a single meaning in the have changed or have been replaced in both languages. For example, \"\" (\"What is your name?\") corresponds to the French \"\" Although the average French speaker would not understand this phrase, every word in it is in fact of French origin: \"what\"; \"manner\"; \"you\", and \"to call\", but the verb has been replaced by in modern French.\n\nLefebvre proposed the theory of relexification, arguing that the process of relexification (the replacement of the phonological representation of a substratum lexical item with the phonological representation of a superstratum lexical item, so that the Haitian creole lexical item looks like French, but works like the substratum language(s)) was central in the development of Haitian Creole.\n\nThe Fon language, a modern Gbe language native to Benin, Nigeria and Togo in West Africa, is often used to compare grammatical structure between Haitian Creole and to relexify it with vocabulary from French:\n\nHaitian Creole developed in the 17th and 18th centuries on the western third of Hispaniola in a setting that mixed native speakers of various Niger–Congo languages with French colonizers. In the early 1940s under President , attempts were made to standardize the language. American linguistic expert Frank Laubach and Irish Methodist missionary H. Ormonde McConnell developed a standardized Haitian Creole orthography. Although some regarded the orthography highly, it was generally not well received. Its orthography was standardized in 1979. That same year Haitian Creole was elevated in status by the Act of 18 September 1979. The established an official orthography for Creole, and slight modifications were made over the next two decades. For example, the is no longer used, nor is the apostrophe. The only accent mark retained is the grave accent in and .\n\nThe Constitution of 1987 upgraded Haitian Creole to a national language alongside French. It classified French as the or \"language of instruction\", and Creole was classified as an or a \"tool of education\". The Constitution of 1987 names both Haitian Creole and French as the official languages, but recognizes Haitian Creole as the only language that all Haitians hold in common.\n\nEven without government recognition, by the end of the 1800s, there were already literary texts written in Haitian Creole such as 's and 's . was another influential author of Haitian Creole work. Since the 1980s, many educators, writers, and activists have written literature in Haitian Creole. In 2001, \"Open Gate: An Anthology of Haitian Creole Poetry\" was published. It was the first time a collection of Haitian Creole poetry was published in both Haitian Creole and English. On 28 October 2004, the Haitian daily first published an entire edition in Haitian Creole in observance of the country's newly instated \"Creole Day\".\n\n\nAlthough both French and Haitian Creole are official languages in Haiti, French is often considered the high language and Haitian Creole as the low language in the diglossic relationship of these two languages in society. That is to say, for the minority of Haitian population that is bilingual, the use of these two languages largely depends on the social context: French is more used in public, especially in formal situation, whereas Haitian Creole is more used in a daily basis and is often heard in ordinary conversation.\n\nThere is a large population in Haiti that speaks only Haitian Creole, whether under formal or informal conditions:\n\nIn most schools, French is still the preferred language for teaching. Generally speaking, Haitian Creole is more used in public schools, as that is where most children of ordinary families who often only speak Haitian Creole go to school.\n\nHistorically, the education system has been French-dominant. Except the children of elites, many had to drop out of school because learning French was very challenging to them and they had a hard time to follow up. The Bernard Reform of 1978 tried to introduce Haitian Creole as the teaching language in the first four years of primary school; however, the reform overall was not very successful. As a result, the use of Haitian Creole has grown but in a very limited way. After the earthquake in 2010, basic education became free and more accessible to the monolingual masses. The government is still trying to expand the use of Haitian Creole and improve the school system.\n\nHaitian Creole has a phonemic orthography with highly regular spelling, except for proper nouns and foreign words. According to the official standardized orthography, Haitian Creole is composed of the following 32 symbols: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . The letters and are always associated with another letter (in the multigraphs , , , and ). The Haitian Creole alphabet has no or ; when is used in loanwords and proper nouns, it represents the sounds , , or .\n\nThe first technical orthography for Haitian Creole was developed in 1940 by H.Ormonde McConnell. It was later revised with the help of Frank Laubach, resulting in the creation of what is known as the McConnell–Laubach orthography.\n\nThe McConnell–Laubach orthography received substantial criticism from members of the Haitian elite. Haitian scholar Charles Pressoir critiqued the McConnell–Laubach orthography for its lack of codified front rounded vowels, which are typically used only by francophone elites. Another criticism was of the broad use of the letters , , and , which Pressoir argued looked \"too American\". This criticism of the \"American look\" of the orthography was shared by many educated Haitians, who also criticized its association with Protestantism. The last of Pressoir's criticisms was that \"the use of the circumflex to mark nasalized vowels\" treated nasal sounds differently from the way they are represented in French, which he feared would inhibit the learning of French.\n\nThe creation of the orthography was essentially an articulation of the language ideologies of those involved and brought out political and social tensions between competing groups. A large portion of this tension lay in the ideology held by many that the French language is superior, which led to resentment of the language by some Haitians and an admiration for it from others. This orthographical controversy boiled down to an attempt to unify a conception of Haitian national identity. Where and seemed too Anglo-Saxon and American imperialistic, and were symbolic of French colonialism.\n\nWhen Haiti was still a colony of France, edicts by the French government were often written in a French-lexicon creole and read aloud to the slave population. The first written text of Haitian Creole was composed in the French-lexicon in a poem called \"Lisette quitté la plaine\" in 1757 by Duvivier de la Mahautière, a White Creole planter.\n\nBefore Haitian Creole orthography was standardized in the late 20th century, spelling varied, but was based on subjecting spoken HaitianCreole to written French, a language whose spelling has not matched its pronunciation since at least the 16thcentury. Unlike the phonetic orthography, French orthography of HaitianCreole is not standardized and varies according to the writer; some use exact French spelling, others adjust the spelling of certain words to represent pronunciation of the cognate in HaitianCreole, removing the silent letters. For example: ( \"He goes to work in the morning\") could be transcribed as:\n\nHaitian Creole grammar is highly analytical: for example, verbs are not inflected for tense or person, and there is no grammatical gender, which means that adjectives and articles are not inflected according to the noun. The primary word order is subject–verb–object as it is in French and English.\n\nMany grammatical features, particularly the pluralization of nouns and indication of possession, are indicated by appending certain markers, like \"yo\", to the main word. There has been a debate going on for some years as to whether these markers are affixes or clitics, and if punctuation such as the hyphen should be used to connect them to the word.\n\nAlthough the language's vocabulary has many words related to their French-language cognates, its sentence structure is like that of the West African Fon language.\n\nThere are six pronouns: first, second, and third person, each in both singular, and plural; all are of French etymological origin. There is no difference between direct and indirect objects.\n\nDefinite nouns are made plural when followed by the word ; indefinite plural nouns are unmarked.\n\nPossession is indicated by placing the possessor or possessive pronoun after the item possessed. In northern Haiti, or is placed before the possessive pronoun.\n\nPossession does not indicate definiteness (\"my friend\" as opposed to \"a friend of mine\"), and possessive constructions are often followed by a definite article.\n\nThe language has two indefinite articles, \"on\" and \"yon\" (pronounced and ) which correspond to French \"un\" and \"une\". \"Yon\" is derived from the French . Both are used only with singular nouns, and are placed before the noun:\n\nIn Haitian Creole, there are five definite articles, and they are placed after the nouns they modify. The final syllable of the preceding word determines which is used with which nouns. If the last sound is an oral consonant and is preceded by an oral vowel, it becomes \"la\":\n\nIf the last sound is an oral consonant and is preceded by a nasal vowel, it becomes \"lan\":\n\nIf the last sound is an oral vowel and is preceded by an oral consonant, it becomes \"a\":\n\nIf a word ends in \"mi\", \"mou\", \"ni\", \"nou\", or a nasal vowel, it becomes \"an\":\n\nIf the last sound is a nasal consonant, it becomes \"nan\", but may also be \"lan\":\n\nThere is a single word \"sa\" that corresponds to English \"this\" and to \"that\" (and to French \"ce\", \"ceci\", \"cela\", and \"ça\"). As in English, it may be used as a demonstrative, except that it is placed after the noun that it qualifies. It is often followed by \"a\" or \"yo\" (in order to mark number): \"sa a\" (\"this here\" or \"that there\"):\n\nAs in English, it may also be used as a pronoun, replacing a noun:\n\nMany verbs in Haitian Creole are the same spoken words as the French infinitive, but there is no conjugation in the language; the verbs have one form only, and changes in tense, mood, and aspect are indicated by the use of markers:\n\nThe concept expressed in English by the verb \"tobe\" is expressed in Haitian Creole by three words, , , and sometimes .\n\nThe verb (pronounced similarly to the English word \"say\") is used to link a subject with a predicate nominative:\n\nThe subject or can sometimes be omitted with :\n\nTo express \"I want to be\", usually (\"tobecome\") is used instead of .\n\nHaitian Creole has stative verbs, which means that the verb \"tobe\" is notovert when followed by an adjective. Therefore, means both \"sick\" and \"\":\n\nThe verb \"to have\" is \"genyen\", often shortened to \"gen\".\n\nThe verb \"genyen\" (or \"gen\") also means \"there is\" or \"there are\":\n\nThe Haitian Creole word for \"to know\" and \"to know how\" is , which is often shortened to .\n\n\"Fè\" means \"do\" or \"make\". It has a broad range of meanings, as it is one of the most common verbs used in idiomatic phrases.\n\nThe verb \"kapab\" (or shortened to \"ka\", \"kap\" or \"kab\") means \"to be able to (do something)\". It refers to both \"capability\" and \"availability\":\n\nThere is no conjugation in Haitian Creole. In the present non-progressive tense, one just uses the basic verb form for stative verbs:\n\nWhen the basic form of action verbs is used without any verb markers, it is generally understood as referring to the past:\n\n\"Manje\" means both \"food\" and \"to eat\", as \"manger\" does in Canadian French; \"m ap manje bon manje\" means \"I am eating good food\".\n\nFor other tenses, special \"tense marker\" words are placed before the verb. The basic ones are:\n\nSimple past or past perfect:\n\nPast progressive:\n\nPresent progressive:\n\nFor the present progressive, it is customary, though not necessary, to add \"\" (\"rightnow\"):\n\nAlso, \"ap manje\" can mean \"will eat\" depending on the context of the sentence:\n\nNear or definite future:\n\nFuture:\n\nOther examples:\n\nRecent past markers include \"fèk\" and \"sòt\" (both mean \"just\" or \"just now\" and are often used together):\n\nA verb mood marker is \"ta\", corresponding to English \"would\" and equivalent to the French conditional tense:\n\nThe word \"pa\" comes before a verb and any tense markers to negate it:\n\nMost of the lexicon of Creole is derived from French, with significant changes in pronunciation and morphology; often the French definite article was retained as part of the noun. For example, the French definite article \"la\" in \"la lune\" (\"the moon\") was incorporated into the Creole noun for moon: \"lalin\". However, the language also inherited many words of different origins, among them Wolof, Fon, Kongo, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Taino and Arabic.\n\nHaitian Creole creates and borrows new words to describe new or old concepts and realities. Examples of this are \"fè bak\" which was borrowed from English and means \"to move backwards\" (the original word derived from French is \"rekile\" from \"reculer\"), and also from English, \"napkin\", which is being used as well as \"tòchon\", from the French \"torchon\".\n\nDespite \"nèg\" and \"blan\" having similar words in French (\"nègre\", a pejorative to refer to black people, and \"blanc\", meaning white, or white person), the meanings they carry in French do not apply in Haitian Creole. \"Nèg\" means \"person\", regardless of skin color (like \"guy\" or \"dude\" in American English). The word \"blan\" generally means \"foreigner\" or \"not from Haiti\". Thus, a non-black Haitian man would be called \"nèg\", while a black person from the US could be referred to as \"blan\".\n\nEtymologically, the word \"nèg\" is derived from the French \"nègre\" and is cognate with the Spanish \"negro\" (\"black\", both the color and the people).\n\nThere are many other Haitian Creole terms for specific tones of skin including \"grimo\", \"bren\", \"roz\", and \"mawon\". Some Haitians consider such labels as offensive because of their association with color discrimination and the Haitian class system, while others use the terms freely.\n\nProverbs play a central role in traditional Haitian culture and Haitian Creole speakers make frequent use of them as well as of other metaphors.\n\nHaitian Creole is used widely among Haitians who have relocated to other countries, particularly the United States and Canada. Some of the larger Creole-speaking populations are found in Montreal, Quebec (where French is the first official language), New York City, Boston, and Central and South Florida (Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach). To reach out to the large Haitian population, government agencies have produced various public service announcements, school-parent communications, and other materials in Haitian Creole. For instance, Miami-Dade County in Florida sends out paper communications in Haitian Creole in addition to English and Spanish. In the Boston area, the Boston subway system and area hospitals and medical offices post announcements in Haitian Creole as well as English. North America's only Creole-language television network is HBN, based in Miami. These areas also each have more than half a dozen Creole-language AM radio stations.\n\nHaitian Creole and Haitian culture are taught in many colleges in the United States and the Bahamas. York College at the City University of New York features a minor in Haitian Creole. Indiana University has a Creole Institute founded by Albert Valdman where Haitian Creole, among other facets of Haiti, are studied and researched. The University of Kansas, Lawrence has an Institute of Haitian studies, founded by Bryant Freeman. Additionally, the University of Massachusetts Boston, Florida International University, and University of Florida offer seminars and courses annually at their Haitian Creole Summer Institute. Brown University, University of Miami, and Duke University also offer Haitian Creole classes, and Columbia University and NYU have jointly offered a course since 2015. The University of Chicago began offering Creole courses in 2010.\n\n, the New York City Department of Education counted 2,838 Haitian Creole-speaking English-language learners (ELLs) in the city's K–12 schools, making it the seventh most common home language of ELLs citywide and the fifth most common home language of Brooklyn ELLs. Because of the large population of Haitian Creole-speaking students within NYC schools, various organizations have been established to respond to the needs of these students. For example, Flanbwayan and Gran Chimen Sant Kiltirèl, both located in Brooklyn, New York, aim to promote education and Haitian culture through advocacy, literacy projects, and cultural/artistic endeavors.\n\nHaitian Creole is the second most spoken language in Cuba after Spanish, where over 300,000 Haitian immigrants speak it. It is recognized as a minority language in Cuba and a considerable number of Cubans speak it fluently. Most of these speakers have never been to Haiti and do not possess Haitian ancestry, but merely learned it in their communities. In addition, there is a Haitian Creole radio station operating in Havana.\n\n, the language was also spoken by over 450,000 Haitians who reside in the neighboring Dominican Republic, although the locals do not speak it. However, some estimates suggest that there are over a million speakers due to a huge population of undocumented immigrants from Haiti.\n\nAs of 2009, up to 80,000 Haitians were estimated residing in the Bahamas, where about 20,000 speak Haitian Creole. It is the third most‑spoken language after English and Bahamian Creole.\n\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, international aid workers desperately needed translation tools for communicating in Haitian Creole. Furthermore, international organizations had little idea whom to contact as translators. As an emergency measure, Carnegie Mellon University released data for its own research into the public domain. Microsoft Research and Google Translate implemented alpha version machine translators based on the Carnegie Mellon data.\n\nSeveral smartphone apps have been released, including learning with flashcards by Byki and two medical dictionaries, one by Educa Vision and a second by Ultralingua, the latter of which includes an audio phrase book and a section on cultural anthropology.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "985458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=985458", "title": "Inupiaq language", "text": "Inupiaq language\n\nInupiaq , Inupiat , Inupiatun or Alaskan Inuit, is a group of dialects of the Inuit languages, spoken by the Iñupiat people in northern and northwestern Alaska, and part of the Northwest Territories. The Inupiat language is a member of the Inuit-Yupik-Unangan language family, and is closely related to Inuit languages of Canada and Greenland. There are roughly 2,000 speakers. It is considered a threatened language with most speakers at or above the age of 40. Iñupiaq is an official language of the State of Alaska.\n\nThe name is also rendered as Inupiatun, Iñupiatun, Iñupiaq, Inyupiaq, Inyupiat, Inyupeat, Inyupik, and Inupik.\n\nThe main varieties of the Iñupiaq language are Northern Alaskan Iñupiaq and Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq.\n\nThe Iñupiaq language has been in decline since contact with English in the late 19th century. American colonization and the legacy of boarding schools have created a situation today where a small minority of Inupiat speak the Iñupiaq language. There is, however, revitalization work underway today in several communities.\n\nThe Iñupiaq language is an Inuit-Yupik-Unangan language, also known as Eskimo-Aleut, has been spoken in the northern regions of Alaska for as many as 5,000 years. Between 1,000 and 800 years ago, Inuit peoples migrated east from Alaska to Canada and Greenland, eventually occupying the entire Arctic coast and much of the surrounding inland areas. The Iñupiaq dialects are the most conservative forms of the Inuit language, with less linguistic change than the other Inuit languages.\n\nIn the mid to late 19th century, Russian, British, and American colonizers would make contact with Inupiat people. In 1885, the American territorial government appointed Rev. Sheldon Jackson as General Agent of Education. Under his administration, Inupiat people (and all Alaska Natives) were educated in English-only environments, forbidding the use of Iñupiaq and other indigenous languages of Alaska. After decades of English-only education, with strict punishment if heard speaking Iñupiaq, after the 1970s, most Inupiat did not pass the Iñupiaq language onto their children, for fear of them being punished for speaking their language.\n\nIn 1972, the Alaska Legislature passed legislation mandating that if \"a [school is attended] by at least 15 pupils whose primary language is other than English, [then the school] shall have at least one teacher who is fluent in the native language\".\n\nToday, the University of Alaska Fairbanks offers bachelor's degrees in Iñupiaq language and culture, while a preschool/kindergarten-level Iñupiaq immersion school named Nikaitchuat Ilisaġviat teaches grades PreK-1st grade in Kotzebue.\n\nIn 2014, Iñupiaq became an official language of the State of Alaska, alongside English and nineteen other indigenous languages.\n\nThere are four main dialect divisions and these can be organized within two larger dialect collections:\nSeward Peninsula Iñupiaq is spoken on the Seward Peninsula. \nNorthern Alaskan Iñupiaq is spoken from the Northwest Arctic and North Slope regions of Alaska to the Mackenzie Delta in Northwest Territories, Canada. \n\nExtra Geographical Information:\n\nBering Strait Dialect:\n\nThe native population of the Big Diomede Island was moved to the Siberian mainland after World War II. The following generation of the population spoke Central Siberian Yupik or Russian. The entire population of King Island moved to Nome in the early 1960s. The Bering Strait dialect might also be spoken in Teller on the Seward Peninsula.\n\nQawiaraq Dialect:\n\nA dialect of Qawiaraq is spoken in Nome. A dialect of Qawariaq may be also be spoken in Koyuk, Mary's Igloo, Council, and Elim. The Teller sub-dialect may be spoken in Unalakleet.\n\nMalimiutun Dialect:\n\nBoth sub-dialects can be found in Buckland, Koyuk, Shaktoolik, and Unalakleet. A dialect of Malimiutun may be spoken in Deering, Kiana, Noorvik, Shungnak, and Ambler. The Malimiutun sub-dialects have also been classified as \"Southern Malimiut\" (found in Koyuk, Shaktoolik, and Unalakleet) and \"Northern Malimiut\" found in \"other villages\".\n\nNorth Slope Dialect:\n\nCommon North Slope is \"a mix of the various speech forms formerly used in the area\". The Point Barrow Dialect was \"spoken only by a few elders\" in 2010. A dialect of North Slope is also spoken in Kivalina, Point Lay, Wainwright, Atqasuk, Utqiagvik, Nuiqsut, and Barter Island.\n\nIñupiaq dialects differ widely between consonants used. However, consonant clusters are always limited to exactly two consonants in a row. A word may not begin nor end with a consonant cluster.\n\nAll Iñupiaq dialects have three basic vowels: \"a, i\", and \"u\". It is unclear how these sounds are exactly pronounced and which, if any, allophones exist. All three vowels can be duplicated: \"aa\", \"ii\", \"uu\". It is likewise unclear how these vowels are pronounced, though this most likely signifies that the vowels are pronounced longer. The following diphthongs can be found: ai, ia, au, ua, iu, ui. A vowel cluster consists of exactly two vowels, no more than two vowels can appear together.\n\nThe Bering strait dialect preserves the fourth proto-Eskimo vowel \"e\", pronounced /ə/ in proto-Eskimo . In the other dialects, the proto-Eskimo \"e\" merged with the closed front vowel \"i\". The merged \"i\" is referred to as the strong \"i\", and causes palatalization when proceeding consonant clusters in the North Slope dialect (see section on palatalization below). The other \"i\" is referred to as the weak \"i\". The weak and strong \"i\" are not differentiated in orthography, therefore it is impossible to tell which \"i\" will cause palatalization \"short of looking at other processes which depend on the distinction between two i's or else examining data from other Eskimo languages\". However, it can be assumed that, within a word, if a palatal consonant is preceded by an \"i\", the \"i\" is strong. If an alveolar consonant is preceded by an \"i\", the \"i\" is weak.\n\nA word may only begin with a stop (excluding palatal stops), s, y, m, n, or a vowel—with the exception of foreign loan words, proper names, and exclamations. This applies to both the Seward Peninsula dialects (using the Little Diomede Island sub-dialect as a representative example) and the North Slope dialects. The only exception is Uummarmiutun, which can have a word begin with an /h/. For example the word for \"ear\" in North Slope and Little Diomede Island dialects is \"siun\" whereas in Uummarmiutun it is \"hiun\".\n\nA word may end in any nasal sound (except for the /ɴ/ found in North Slope), in the stops t, k, q, or in a vowel. In the North Slope dialect if a word ends with an m, and the next word begins with a stop, the m is pronounced /p/. For Example: aġnam tupiŋa is read /aʁnap tupiŋa/ (IPA for vowels may be incorrect).\n\nVery little information of the prosody of Iñupiaq can be found. However, \"fundamental frequency (Hz), intensity (dB), loudness (sones), and spectral tilt (phons - dB) may be important\" in Malimiutun. Likewise, \"duration is not likely to be important in Malimiut Iñupiaq stress/syllable prominence\".\n\nPlease note, all ambiguities listed below exist because sources are inconsistent in reporting phonology. The phonological inventory was pieced together using multiple sources. Any discrepancies between the sources are marked as ambiguities. Ambiguities do not represent dialectal differentiation or different allophones.\n\nThe voiceless stops /p/ /t/ /k/ and /q/ are not aspirated. This may or may not be true for other dialects as well.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The sound might actually be the sound . The sound might not exist. Recent learners of the language, and heritage speakers are replacing the sound (written in Iñupiaq as \"r\") with the American English /ɹ/ sound.\n\n/c/ is derived from a palatalized and unreleased /t/.\n\nTwo consonants cannot appear together unless they share the manner of articulation (in this case treating the lateral and approximate consonants as fricatives). The only exception to this rule is having a voiced fricative consonant appear with a nasal consonant. Since all stops in North Slope are voiceless, a lot of needed assimilation arises from having to assimilate a voiceless stop to a voiced consonant.\n\nThis process is realized by assimilating the first consonant in the cluster to a consonant that: 1) has the same (or closest possible) area of articulation as the consonant being assimilated; and 2) has the same manner of articulation as the second consonant that it is assimilating to. If the second consonant is a lateral or approximate, the first consonant will assimilate to a lateral or approximate if possible. If not the first consonant will assimilate to a fricative. Therefore:\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The sound /ɴ/ is not represented in the orthography. Therefore the spelling ġn can be pronounced as /ʁn/ or /ɴn/. In both examples 1 and 2, since voiced fricatives can appear with nasal consonants, both consonant clusters are possible.kiiii\n\nThe stops /t̚ / and /t/ do not have a corresponding voiced fricative, therefore they will assimilate to the closest possible area of articulation. In this case, the /t̚ / will assimilate to the voiced approximant /j/. The /t/ will assimilate into a . Therefore:\nIn the case of the second consonant being a lateral, the lateral will again be treated as a fricative. Therefore:\n\nSince voiced fricatives can appear with nasal consonants, both consonant clusters are possible.\n\nThe sounds and are not represented in the orthography (unless they occur alone between vowels). Therefore, like the /ɴn/ example shown above, assimilation still occurs while the spelling remains the same. Therefore:\nThese general features of assimilation are not shared with Uummarmiut, Malimiutun, or the Seward Peninsula dialects. Malimiutun and the Seward Peninsula dialects \"preserve[] voiceless stops (k, p, q, t) when they are etymological (i.e. when they belong to the original word-base)\". Compare:\nThe following patterns of palatalization can occur in North Slope Iñupiaq: /t/ → /t̚ / or /s/; → ; → ; and /n/ → . Palatalization only occurs when one of these four alveolars is proceeded by a strong \"i\". Compare:\nPlease note that the sound /it̚ / does not have its own letter, and is simply spelled with a T t. The IPA transcription of the above vowels may be incorrect.\n\nIf a t that proceeds a vowel is palatalized, it will become an /s/. The strong \"i\" affects the entire consonant cluster, palatalizing all consonants that can be palatalized within the cluster. Therefore:\nNote in the first example, due to the nature of the suffix, the /q/ is dropped. Like the first set of examples, the IPA transcriptions of above vowels may be incorrect.\n\nIf a strong \"i\" precedes geminate consonant, the entire elongated consonant becomes palatalized. For Example: niġḷḷaturuq and tikiññiaqtuq.\n\nThe strong \"i\" can be paired with a vowel. The weak \"i\" on the other hand cannot. The weak i will become an \"a\" if it is paired with another vowel, or if the consonant before the \"i\" becomes geminate. This rule may or may not apply to other dialects. Therefore:\n\nLike the first two sets of examples, the IPA transcriptions of above vowels may be incorrect.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Ambiguities: This sound might exist in the Uummarmiutun sub dialect.\n\nThe /f/ is always found as a geminate.\n\nThe /j/ cannot be geminated, and is always found between vowels or proceeded by /v/. In rare cases it can be found at the beginning of a word.\n\nThe /h/ is never geminate, and can appear as the first letter of the word, between vowels, or preceded by /k/ /ɬ/ or /q/.\n\nThe and are always geminate or preceded by a /t/.\n\nThe can appear between vowels, preceded by consonants /k/ /q/ /t/ or /v/, or it can be followed by , /v/, .\n\nUnlike the other Iñupiaq dialects, the Seward Peninsula dialect has a mid central vowel e (see the beginning of the phonology section for more information).\n\nIn North Slope Iñupiaq, all consonants represented by orthography can be geminated, except for the sounds /s/ /h/ and . Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq (using vocabulary from the Little Diomede Island as a representative sample) likewise can have all consonants represented by orthography appear as geminates, except for /b/ /h/ /w/ /z/ and . Gemination is caused by suffixes being added to a consonant, so that the consonant is found between two vowels.\n\nIñupiaq was first written when explorers first arrived in Alaska and began recording words in the native languages. They wrote by adapting the letters of their own language to writing the sounds they were recording. Spelling was often inconsistent, since the writers invented it as they wrote. Unfamiliar sounds were often confused with other sounds, so that, for example, 'q' was often not distinguished from 'k' and long consonants or vowels were not distinguished from short ones.\n\nAlong with the Alaskan and Siberian Yupik, the Inupiat eventually adopted the Latin script (\"Qaliujaaqpait\") that Moravian missionaries developed in Greenland and Labrador. Native Alaskans also developed a system of pictographs, which, however, died with its creators.\n\nIn 1946, Roy Ahmaogak, an Iñupiaq Presbyterian minister from Utqiagvik, worked with Eugene Nida, a member of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, to develop the current Iñupiaq alphabet based on the Latin script. Although some changes have been made since its origin—most notably the change from 'ḳ' to 'q'—the essential system was accurate and is still in use.\nExtra letter for Kobuk dialect: ' \n\nExtra letters for specific dialects:\n\nDue the number of dialects and complexity of Iñupiaq Morphosyntax, the following section will be discussing Malimiutun morphosyntax as a representative example. Any examples from other dialects will be marked as such.\n\nIñupiaq is a polysynthetic language, meaning that words can be extremely long, consisting of one of three stems (verb stem, noun stem, and demonstrative stem) along with one or more of three endings (postbases, (grammatical) endings, and enclitics). The stem gives meaning to the word, whereas endings give information regarding case, mood, tense, person, plurality, etc. The stem can appear as simple (having no postbases) or complex (having one or more postbases). In Iñupiaq a \"postbase serves somewhat the same functions that adverbs, adjectives, prefixes, and suffixes do in English\" along with marking various types of tenses. There are six word classes in Malimiut Inñupiaq: nouns (see Nominal Morphology), verbs (see Verbal Morphology), adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions, and interjections. All demonstratives are classified as either adverbs or pronouns.\n\nThe Iñupiaq category of number distinguishes singular, dual, and plural. The language works on an Ergative-Absolutive system, where nouns are inflected for number, several cases, and possession. Iñupiaq (Malimiutun) has nine cases, two core cases (ergative and absolutive) and seven oblique cases (instrumental, allative, ablative, locative, perlative, similative and vocative). North Slope Iñupiaq does not have the vocative case. Iñupiaq does not have a category of gender and articles.\n\nIñupiaq Nouns can likewise be classified by Wolf A. Seiler's 7 noun classes. These noun classes are \"based on morphological behavior. [They] ... have no semantic basis but are useful for case formation ... stems of various classes interact with suffixes differently\".\n\nDue to the nature of the morphology, a single case can take on up to 12 endings (ignoring the fact that realization of these endings can change depending on noun class). For example, the possessed ergative ending for a class 1a noun can take on the endings: -ma, mnuk, pta, vich, ptik, -psi, -mi, -mik, -miŋ, -ŋan, -ŋaknik, and ŋata. Therefore only general features will be described below. For an extensive list on case endings, please see Seiler 2012, Appendix 4, 6, and 7.\n\nThe subject of an intransitive sentence or the object of a transitive sentence take on the absolutive case. This case is likewise used to mark the basic form of a noun. Therefore all the singular, dual, and plural absolutive forms serve as stems for the other oblique cases. The following chart is verified of both Malimiutun and North Slope Iñupiaq. \n\nIf the singular absolutive form ends with -n, it has the underlying form of -ti /tə/. This form will show in the absolutive dual and plural forms. Therefore: tiŋmisuun (airplane) → tiŋmisuutik (two airplanes) and tiŋmisuutit (multiple airplanes)Regarding nouns that have an underlying /ə/ (weak i), the \"i\" will change to an \"a\" and the previous consonant will be geminated in the dual form. Therefore:Kamik (boot) → kammak (two boots). If the singular form of the noun ends with -k, the preceding vowel will be elongated. Therefore: savik (knife) → saviik (two knives). On occasion, the consonant preceding the final vowel is also geminated, though exact phonological reasoning is unclear.\n\nThe ergative case is often referred to as the Relative Case in Iñupiaq sources. This case marks the subject of a transitive sentence or a genitive (possessive) noun phrase. For non-possessed noun phrases, the noun is marked only if it is a third person singular. The unmarked nouns leave ambiguity as to who/what is the subject and object. This can be resolved only through context. Possessed noun phrases and noun phrases expressing genitive are marked in ergative for all persons.\n\nThis suffix applies to all singular unpossessed nouns in the ergative case.\n\nPlease note the underlying /tə/ form in the first example. \n\nThis case is also referred to as the Modalis case. This case has a wide range of uses described below:\nSince the ending is the same for both dual and plural, different stems are used. In all the examples the k is assimilated to an ŋ. \n\nThe allative case is also referred to as the Terminalis case. The uses of this case are described below:\n\nAgain, Malimiutun Iñupiaq is used as a representative example in this section. The basic structure of the verb is [(verb) + (derivational suffix) + (inflectional suffix) + (enclitic)], although Lanz (2010) argues that this approach is insufficient since it \"forces one to analyze ... optional ... suffixes\". Every verb has an obligatory inflection for person, number, and mood (all marked by a single suffix), and can have other inflectional suffixes such as tense, aspect, modality, and various suffixes carrying adverbial functions.\n\nTense marking is always optional. The only explicitly marked tense is the future tense. Past and present tense cannot be marked and are always implied. All verbs can be marked through adverbs to show relative time (using words such as \"yesterday\" or \"tomorrow\"). If neither of these markings is present, the verb can imply a past, present, or future tense.\nMarking aspect is optional in Iñupiaq verbs. Both North Slope and Malimiut Iñupiaq have a perfective versus imperfective distinction in aspect, along with other distinctions such as: frequentative (-ataq; \"to repeatedly verb\"), habitual (-suu; \"to always, habitually verb\"), inchoative (-łhiñaaq; \"about to verb\"), and intentional (-saġuma; \"intend to verb\"). The aspect suffix can be found after the verb root and before or within the obligatory person-number-mood suffix.\n\nIñupiaq has the following moods: Indicative, Interrogative, Imperative (positive, negative), Coordinative, and Conditional. Participles are sometimes classified as a mood. \n\nIndicative mood endings can be transitive or intransitive, as seen in the table below.\nNearly all syntactic operations in the Malimiut dialect of Iñiupiaq—and Inuit languages and dialects in general—are carried out via morphological means.\" The language aligns to an ergative-absolutive case system, which is mainly shown through nominal case markings and verb agreement (see above).\n\nThe basic word order is subject-object-verb. However, word order is flexible and both subject and/or object can be omitted. There is a tendency for the subject of a transitive verb (marked by the ergative case) to precede the object of the clause (marked by the absolutive case). There is likewise a tendency for the subject of an intransitive verb (marked by the absolutive case) to precede the verb. The subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a clause (both marked by the absolutive case) are usually found right before the verb. However, \"this is [all] merely a tendency.\" \n\nIñupiaq grammar also includes morphological passive, antipassive, causative and applicative.\n\nNoun incorporation is a common phenomenon in Malimiutun Iñupiaq. The first type of noun incorporation is \"lexical compounding\". Within this subset of noun incorporation, the noun, which represents an instrument, location, or patient in relation to the verb, is attached to the front of the verb stem, creating a new intransitive verb. The second type is \"manipulation of case\". It is argued whether this form of noun incorporation is present as noun incorporation in Iñupiaq, or \"semantically transitive noun incorporation\"—since with this kind of noun incorporation the verb remains transitive. The noun phrase subjects are incorporated not syntactically into the verb but rather as objects marked by the instrumental case. The third type of incorporation, \"manipulation of discourse structure\", is supported by Mithun (1984) and argued against by Lanz (2010). See Lanz's paper for further discussion. The final type of incorporation is \"classificatory noun incorporation\", whereby a \"general [noun] is incorporated into the [verb], while a more specific [noun] narrows the scope\". With this type of incorporation, the external noun can take on external modifiers and, like the other incorporations, the verb becomes intransitive. See \"Nominal Morphology\" (\"Instrumental Case, Usage of Instrumental\" table, row four) on this page for an example.\n\nSwitch-references occur in dependent clauses only with third person subjects. The verb must be marked as reflexive if the third person subject of the dependent clause matches the subject of the main clause (more specifically matrix clause). Compare:\nThis is a sample of the Iñupiaq language of the Kivalina variety from \"Kivalina Reader,\" published in 1975.\nAaŋŋaayiña aniñiqsuq Qikiqtami. Aasii iñuguġuni. Tikiġaġmi Kivaliñiġmiḷu.

Although not designed to study language, similar experiments on non-human primates (labelled the \"Pit of despair\") utilising complete social deprivation resulted in psychosis.\n\nAncient records suggest that this kind of experiment was carried out from time to time. An early record of an experiment of this kind can be found in Herodotus's \"Histories\". According to Herodotus, the Egyptian pharaoh Psamtik I carried out such an experiment, and concluded the Phrygian race must antedate the Egyptians since the child had first spoken something similar to the Phrygian word \"bekos\", meaning \"bread\". However, it is likely that this was a willful interpretation of their babbling.\n\nAn experiment allegedly carried out by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in the 13th century saw young infants raised without human interaction in an attempt to determine if there was a natural language that they might demonstrate once their voices matured. It is claimed he was seeking to discover what language would have been imparted unto Adam and Eve by God.\n\nThe experiments were recorded by the monk Salimbene di Adam in his \"Chronicles\", who wrote that Frederick encouraged \"foster-mothers and nurses to suckle and bathe and wash the children, but in no ways to prattle or speak with them; for he would have learnt whether they would speak the Hebrew language (which he took to have been the first), or Greek, or Latin, or Arabic, or perchance the tongue of their parents of whom they had been born. But he laboured in vain, for the children could not live without clappings of the hands, and gestures, and gladness of countenance, and blandishments.\"\n\nSeveral centuries after Frederick II's experiment, James IV of Scotland was said to have sent two children to be raised by a mute woman isolated on the island of Inchkeith, to determine if language was learned or innate. The children were reported to have spoken good Hebrew, but historians were skeptical of these claims soon after they were made.\nThis experiment was later repeated by the Mughal emperor Akbar, who held that speech arose from hearing, thus children raised without hearing human speech would become mute.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2400606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2400606", "title": "Minibar", "text": "Minibar\n\nA minibar is a small refrigerator, typically an absorption refrigerator, in a luxury hotel room or cruise ship stateroom. The hotel staff fill it with drinks and snacks for the guest to purchase during their stay. It is stocked with a precise inventory of goods, with a price list. The guest is charged for goods consumed when checking out of the hotel. Some newer minibars use infrared or other automated methods of recording purchases. These detect the removal of an item, and charge the guest's credit card right away, even if the item is not consumed. This is done to prevent loss of product, theft and lost revenue. Thus it is generally recommended for guests and their kids not to touch items in the minibar to avoid unwanted charges.\n\nThe minibar is commonly stocked with small bottles of alcoholic beverages, juice, bottled water, and soft drinks. There may also be candy, cookies, crackers, and other small snacks. Prices are generally very high compared to similar items purchased from a store, because the guest is paying for the convenience of immediate access and also the upkeep of the bar. Prices vary, but it is not uncommon for one can of non-alcoholic beverage to cost 6–10 USD. Due to the convenience of room service and the minibar, prices charged to the patron are much higher than the hotel's restaurant or tuck shop. As premium bottled water has become popular with guests since the 2000s, there is \"ambient placement\" of such chargeable products outside the minibar and in the guests' line of vision; for example \"by placing [bottled] water on bedside tables, during the night, people are more likely to grab it than get up to get a glass of water\".\n\nThe world's first minibar was introduced at the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel by manager Robert Arnold in 1974. In the months following its introduction in-room drink sales skyrocketed 500%, and the Hong Kong Hilton's overall annual revenue was boosted by 5%. The following year the Hilton group rolled out the minibar concept across all its hotels.\n\nIn recent years, as minibars become less and less popular with guests, hotels have been eliminating this feature from their rooms. It takes staff considerable time to re-stock the traditional mini-bar inventory and monitor its use precisely, and such manual work is prone to human error. In recent years cunning guests have managed to game the traditional minibar system, such as \"drink the contents of the miniature Scotch bottle and replace them with weak tea. Water will do fine for the vodka. The Toblerone? Slit open the box with care and you can put it back empty\" (known as \"shrinkage\" as this fools both hotel staff and the next set of hotel guests), consume some minibar items before immediately lodging a noise/odor complaint to switch hotel rooms, and disputing the minibar charges at check-out time. Some newer minibars use infrared or other automated methods of recording purchases, detecting the removal of an item and automatically charge the guest's credit card right away, even if the item is not consumed.\n\nTypically the minibar cooling unit was different from standard refrigerators, using absorption technology. An Italian company was the first manufacturer to install a compressor mini-refrigerator in the NASA Space Shuttle in 1982. A compressor refrigeration unit, in addition to a timer\nand a eutectic plate, allow saving more energy, compared to a traditional absorption minibar.\n"}
{"id": "6343902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6343902", "title": "Mobile signature", "text": "Mobile signature\n\nA mobile signature is a digital signature generated either on a mobile phone or on a SIM card on a mobile phone.\n\nThe term first appeared in articles introducing mSign (short for Mobile Electronic Signature Consortium). It was founded in 1999 and comprised 35 member companies. In October 2000, the consortium published an XML-interface defining a protocol allowing service providers to obtain a mobile (digital) signature from a mobile phone subscriber.\n\nIn 2001, mSign gained industry-wide coverage when it came apparent that Brokat (one of the founding companies) also obtained a process patent in Germany for using the mobile phone to generate digital signatures.\n\nThe term was then used by Paul Gibson (G&D) and Romary Dupuis (France Telecom) in their standardisation work at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and published in ETSI Technical Report TR 102 203.\n\nThe ETSI-MSS specifications define a SOAP interface and mobile signature roaming for systems implementing mobile signature services. ETSI TS 102 204, and ETSI TS 102 207.\n\nThe mobile signature can have the legal equivalent of your own wet signature, hence the term \"Mobile Ink\", commercial term coined by Swiss Sicap. Other terms include \"Mobile ID\" by Valimo Wireless, \"Mobile Certificate\" by a circle of trust of 3 Finnish mobile network operators implementing a roaming mobile signature framework Mobiilivarmenne, etc.\n\nAccording to the EU directives for electronic signatures the mobile signature can have the same level of protection as the handwritten signature if all components in the signature creation chain are appropriately certified. The governing standard for the mobile signature creation devices and equivalent of a handwritten signature is described in the Commission Decision 2003/511/EC of 14 July 2003 on the publication of reference numbers of generally recognised standards for electronic signature products in accordance with the Electronic Signatures Directive. If the signature solution is Common Criteria evaluated by an independent party and given the EAL4+ designation, the solution can produce what the EU directive and consequent clarifications are calling a qualified electronic signature. The current standard dates back to the year 2002/2003 and is in the process being renewed and published by the end of 2012. Most, if not all, mobile signature implementations to date generate what the EU Directive is calling advanced electronic signature.\n\nThe most successful mobile signature solutions can be found in Turkey, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland with millions of users.\n\nTechnically the mobile signature is created by a security module when a request for it reaches the device (SIM card) and after introducing the request to the user with a few explanation prompts, the device asks for a secret code that only the correct user should know. Usually, this is in form of a PIN. If the access control secret was entered correctly, the device is approved with access to secret data containing for example RSA private key, which is then used to do the signature or other operations that the request wanted.\n\nThe PKI system associates the public key counterpart of the secret key held at the secure device with a set of attributes contained in a structure called digital certificate. The choice of the registration procedure details during the definition of the attributes included in this digital certificate can be used to produce different levels of identity assurance. Anything from anonymous but specific to high-standard real-word identity. By doing a signature, the secure device owner can claim that identity.\n\nThus, the mobile signature is a unique feature for:\n\nSee .\n\nMobile Ink unites high security and user-friendly access to digital services which require strong authentication and authorization. Subscribers can get mobile signature access to m-banking or corporate applications for example. Mobile Ink is a commercial term associated with the mobile signature solution of Sicap building on Kiuru MSSP platform by Methics Oy.\n\nThe platform allows simultaneous existence of multiple keys and associated identities with distinct registration procedures.\nThis is used for example as a replacement for RSA SecureID dongles with anonymous but specific identity in corporate access applications.\n\nMobile Certificate i.e. Mobiilivarmenne in Finnish is a term used in the Finnish market space to describe the roaming mobile signature solution deployed by the three mobile network operators Elisa, Sonera, and DNA.\n\nThis setup was developed in all three operators co-operation under national Telecom technology coordination group FiCom, and it is world's first system where a fully functional co-operating ETSI TS 102 207 roaming service mesh was established in multi-vendor software environment. Another national feature is that mobile phone numbers are portable across the operators, and thus the phone number prefix does not identify the operator. To make things easy for the Application Providers (see ETSI TS 102 204), they can purchase service from any one of the Acquiring Entity service providers (mobile network operators), and reach all users.\n\nPart of the background was update of national laws allowing digital Person Identity Certificates (for Mobiilivarmenne use) to be issued also by other parties than official registration authorities via Police offices. Another part was co-operation agreement between the operators on the form of the certificates, and certification procedures and practices producing similar certificate contents with similar identity issuance traceability. All of these were reviewed and approved by the Finnish Communication Regulatory Authority which tasks include the oversight of the identity registration services also at government registries.\n\nThe MSSP software vendors in the service mesh are Methics Oy, and Valimo Wireless. Both Finnish companies.\n\nIn Ukraine, Mobile ID project started in 2015, and later declared as one of Government of Ukraine priorities supported by EU. At the beginning of 2018 Ukrainian cell operators are evaluating proposals and testing platforms from different local and foreign developers. Platform selection will be followed up by comprehensive certification process. List of cryptographic information protection tools (and manufacturers), that are legally allowed for use in Ukraine (as of February 19, 2018).\n\n\nMPass \n\nAustria started mobile signature by 2003, as a technology of \"Bürgerkarte\" (which includes electronic signing with SmartCards). It was provided bei mobilkom Austria, but ended in 2007. After a relaunch in 2009, named \"Handy-Signatur\", it is well used, by 2014 over 300.000 people, 5% of the adult inhabitants, own a registered mobile signature. It is controlled by Austrian Government, National Bank and Graz University of Technology. It is based on a TAN sent bei SMS on request and confirmed with a private PIN. According to 1999/93/EG signing by Handy-Signature is completely equivalent to a handwritten autograph.\n\nValimo Wireless, a Gemalto company, was the first company in the world to introduce mobile signature solutions into the market and creating the term Mobile ID. The initial mobile signature solution in Turkey by Turkcell used Valimo technology to implement the very successful mobile signature solution. Currently Valimo Mobile ID is in use in several countries.\n\nMethics Oy is a privately held Finnish technology company with strong expertise on PKI and MSSP services. The Kiuru MSSP product line is used directly and as OEM product by several service and solution providers.\n\nMobile ID platform by Innovation Development HUB LLC is the only electronic identification and mobile signature solution, having already passed State certification in Ukraine. Uses both post-Soviet and European cryptography algorithms, which makes the platform suitable for CIS and EU PKI.\n\nG&D SmartTrust is the original supplier of SIM card embedded WAP browsers with encryption plugins developed in late 1990es, it is called WIB (Wireless Internet Browser.) The WIB technology is licensed by the SmartTrust to many SIM card manufacturers, and the mobile network operators can choose to use cards with WIB capabilities in their normal user base immediately enabling them for use of the MSSP services.\nSmartTrust's MSSP offering is called SmartLicentio.\n\nAuthentication may still be vulnerable to man in the middle attacks and trojan horses, depending on the scheme employed. Schemes like one-time-password-generators and two-factor authentication does not completely solve man in the middle attacks on an open network like the Internet. However, supporting the authentication on the Internet with a parallel closed network like mobile/GSM and a digital signature enabled SIM card is the most secure method today against the man in the middle attack. If application provider provides a detailed explanation of the transaction to be signed both on its Internet site and signing request to mobile operator, the attack can easily be recognized by the individual by comparing both screens. Since mobile operators do not let applications to send signing request for free, normally the cost and technicality of intrusion between the application provider and the mobile operator makes it an improbable attack target. Very least there are trace evidences in multiple places for the attack to have happened.\n\nWhen a mobile user creates their sPIN (signing PIN) and secret key online within the secure SIM card during the registration process, this is known as \"on-board key generation\". This requires a bit more interaction on user's behalf while registering, but on the other hand it makes the security mode interaction process familiar and lets them practice service usage. Also when the user forgets/locks the PIN associated with generated key, it is simple to generate a new key and assign it a new sPIN destroying the previous versions using same process as with original registration, and most importantly: without need for replacement of the SIM card. In these systems there is commonly no secondary signing PIN unblocking code (sPUK) at all, because revelation of such a code has identical requirements for the requesting person's identity verification as was with original person's identity registration.\n\nCompare this with older \"factory generated keys\" model for older technology SIM cards that had insufficient processing power to do on-board key generation. The SIM card factory ran key-generation with special hardware accelerator and stored the key material on card along with initial sPIN and sPUK codes. Sometimes actual generation happened within the SIM card that was running in special manufacturing mode. After the generation the capability of doing it at all was usually disabled by blowing a special control fuse. Delivery of in particular the sPUK codes creates considerable security information logistics problems, which can entirely be avoided with the use of on-board key generation.\n\nTurkcell was the first provider to roll out a mobile signature service with \"On Board Key Generation\" functionality, which enables customers to create their signing and validation key pair, after they get the simcard. In this way GSM operators do not need to distribute signing PINs to customers. Customers can create their sPIN anew, on their own.\n\nIn introduction of the Finnish Mobiilivarmenne service in 2010, only one out of three operators chose to use this on-board key generation capability with user interaction. Cited reasons claimed it to be too hard for the user. Actual experience did show that those without it created easily non-functional registrations without any online indication of the status, while usage of on-board key generation always resulted in positive indication of success when the service became fully functional for the user. Also if a mobile phone version had issues with SIM Application Toolkit protocol, that became evident immediately during a registration process using on-board key generation.\n\n"}

{"id": "74879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74879", "title": "Northeast Caucasian languages", "text": "Northeast Caucasian languages\n\nThe Northeast Caucasian languages, or Nakh-Daghestanian languages, are a language family spoken in the Russian republics of Dagestan, Chechnya and Ingushetia and in northern Azerbaijan as well as in diaspora populations in Western Europe, Turkey and the Middle East. They are occasionally called North Caspian, as opposed to \"North Pontic\" for the Northwest Caucasian languages.\n\nSeveral names have been in use for this family. The most common term, \"Northeast Caucasian,\" contrasts the three established families of the Caucasus language area: \"Northeast Caucasian, Northwest Caucasian\" (Abkhaz–Adyghean), and \"South Caucasian\" (Kartvelian). This may be shortened to \"East Caucasian\". The term \"Nakh(o)-Dagestanian\" can be taken to reflect a primary division of the family into Nakh and Dagestanian branches, a view which is no longer widely accepted, or \"Dagestanian\" can subsume the entire family. The rare term \"North Caspian\" (as in bordering the Caspian Sea) is only used in opposition to the use of \"North Pontic\" (as in bordering the Black Sea) for the Northwest Caucasian languages.\n\nHistorically, Northeast Caucasian phonemic inventories were thought to be significantly smaller than those of the neighboring Northwest Caucasian family. However, more recent research has revealed that many Northeast Caucasian languages are much more phoneme-rich than previously believed, with some languages containing as many as 70 consonants.\n\nIn addition to numerous oral obstruents, many Northeast Caucasian languages also possess a number of back consonants, including uvulars, pharyngeals, and glottal stops and fricatives. Northeast Caucasian phonology is also notable for its use of numerous secondary articulations as contrastive features. Whereas English consonant classes are divided into voiced and voiceless phonemes, Northeast Caucasian languages are known to contrast phones into voiced, voiceless, ejective, and tense variants, which contributes to their large phonemic inventories. Some languages also include palatalization and labialization as contrastive features. Most languages in this family contrast tense and weak consonants. Tense consonants are characterized by the intensiveness of articulation, which naturally leads to a lengthening of these consonants.\n\nIn contrast to the generally large consonant inventories of Northeast Caucasian languages, most languages in the family have relatively few vowels. However, there are some exceptions to this trend, such as Chechen, which has at least twenty-eight vowels, diphthongs, and triphthongs.\n\nThese languages can be characterized by strong suffixal agglutination. Weak tendencies towards inflection may be noted as well. Nouns display covert nominal classification, but partially overt cases of secondary origin can be observed too. The number of noun classes in individual languages range from two to eight. Regarding grammatical number, there may be a distinction between singular and plural, plurality itself may impact the class to which a noun belongs. In some cases, a grammatical collective is seen. Many languages distinguish \"local\" versus \"functional\" cases, and to some degree also \"casus rectus\" versus \"casus obliquus\".\n\nThe inflectional paradigms are often based on partially classifying productive stem extensions (absolutive, and oblique, ergative, and genitive inflection. Localization is mostly conveyed by postpositions, but it can be also partly based on preverbs. Noun phrases exhibit incomplete class agreement, group inflection (on the noun) with partial attributive oblique marking, which may, in turn, carry a partially determining function.\n\nMost Northeast Caucasian languages exhibit an ergative–absolutive morphology. This means that objects of transitive sentences and subjects of intransitive sentences both fall into a single grammatical case known as the absolutive. Subjects of transitive sentences, however, carry a different marking to indicate that they belong to a separate case, known as the ergative. This distinction can be seen in the following two Archi sentences. Note that objects and subjects of intransitive sentences carry no suffix, which is represented by the null suffix, -. Meanwhile, agents of transitive sentences take the ergative suffix, -mu.\n\nBlue is used to mark ergative markers, as well as and transitive agents in the English translations.\n\nRed is used to mark null morphemes, as well as transitive objects and intransitive subjects in the English translations.\n\nNortheast Caucasian languages have between two and eight noun classes. In these languages, nouns are grouped into grammatical categories depending on certain semantic qualities, such as animacy and gender. Each noun class has a corresponding agreement prefix, which can attach to verbs or adjectives of that noun. Prefixes may also have plural forms, used in agreement with a plural noun. The following table shows the noun–adjective agreement paradigm in the Tsez language. Colors are used to emphasize agreement between adjectival prefixes and noun classes.\n\nA long-time classification divided the family into Nakh and Dagestanian branches, whence the term Nakho-Dagestanian. However, attempts at reconstructing the protolanguage suggest that the Nakh languages are no more divergent from Dagestanian than the various branches of Dagestanian are from each other, although this is still not universally accepted. The following outline, based on the work of linguist Bernard Comrie and others, has been adopted by \"Ethnologue.\" An Avar–Andi–Dido branch was abandoned, but has been resurrected as the \"New Type\" languages in Schulze (2009, 2013), and Lak–Dargwa has likewise returned.\n\nPopulation data is from \"Ethnologue\" 16th ed.\n\nSpoken in the Northwest Dagestan highlands and western Dagestan. Avar is the lingua franca for these and the Tsezic languages and is the only literary language.\nSchulze (2009) gives the following family tree for the Avar–Andic languages:\n\nFigures retrieved from Ethnologue.\nThese languages are spoken in the following rayons of Dagestan: Axvax, Botlikh, Buynaksk (Shura), Čarodinsky (Tsurib), Gergebil, Gumbetovsky (Baklul), Gunib, Karabudaxkent, Kazbekovsky (Dylym), Lavaša, Tsumada (Agvali), Untsukul, Xebda, Xunzaq and Zaqatala rayon in Azerbaijan.\n\nSpoken by 492,490 in Dagestan, as well as Azerbaijan, Central Asia, and Ukraine. Dargwa proper is a literary language.\nDargwa is spoken in the following rayons of Dagestan: Aquša, Kaitak, Kayakent, Kubači, Sergokala.\n\nSpoken in Quba rayon of Azerbaijan.\n\nSpoken in the Central Dagestan highlands. Lak is a literary language.\nLak is spoken in two rayons of Dagestan: Kumux and Kuli (Vači).\n\nSpoken in the Southeast Dagestan highlands and in Northern Azerbaijan. The Lezgian language or, as the Lezgian people themselves call it, \"Лезги чlал (lezgi ch'al),\" is the biggest in terms of the number of native speakers of all the languages of the Lezgic group (other languages from this group include Tabasaran, Udi, Tsakhur, and Rutul). They are spoken in the following rayons of Dagestan: Agul, Axty, Derbent (Kvevar), Kasumxur, Kurax, Magaramkent, Rutul, Tabasaran, Usuxčay, Xiv and Quba and Zaqatala in Azerbaijan. \nTabasaran was once thought to be the language with the largest number of grammatical cases at 54, which could, depending on the analysis, instead be the Tsez language with 64. \n\nLezgian and Tabasaran are literary languages.\n\n\nAll figures retrieved from Ethnologue.\n\nSpoken in Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Georgia. Chechen and Ingush are official languages of their respective republics.\n\nSpoken mostly in Southwest Dagestan. None are literary languages. Formerly classified geographically as East Tsezic (Hinukh, Bezta) and West Tsezic (Tsez, Khwarshi, Hunzib), these languages may actually form different subgroupings according to the latest research by Schulze (2009):\n\n\nAll figures except for Khwarshi were retrieved from Ethnologue.\nThese languages are spoken in Tsuntsin and Bežta areas of Dagestan.\n\nSome linguists such as Sergei Starostin think that the Northeast and Northwest Caucasian languages should be joined into a putative North Caucasian family, citing shared vocabulary and typological features as evidence. This proposed family does not usually include the neighboring Kartvelian languages. This hypothesis is not well demonstrated.\n\nSome linguists—notably Igor M. Diakonoff and Starostin—also see similarities between the Northeast Caucasian family and the extinct languages Hurrian and Urartian.\nHurrian was spoken in various parts of the Fertile Crescent in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. Urartian was the language of Urartu, a powerful state that existed between 1000 BC or earlier and 585 BC in the area centered on Lake Van in current Turkey.\n\nThe two extinct languages have been grouped into the Hurro-Urartian family. Diakonoff proposed the name \"Alarodian\" for the union of Hurro-Urartian and Northeast Caucasian.\n\nHowever, the validity of both Alarodian and North Caucasian hypothetical families is rejected or viewed as doubtful by most historical linguists.\n\nThe Proto-Northeast Caucasian language had many terms for agriculture, and Johanna Nichols has suggested that its speakers may have been involved in the development of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent. They had words for concepts such as \"yoke\", as well as fruit trees such as \"apple\" and \"pear\" that suggest agriculture was already well developed when the proto-language broke up.\n\n\n\n"}

It is represented as in the Oromo script (\"Qubee\") though it is pronounced as a in most other dialects.\n\nOromo has five vowels which all contrast long and short vowels. Sometimes there is a change in vowel quality when the vowel is short. Short vowels tend to be more centralized than their counterparts.\n\nThough sometimes diphthongs may occur, there are none that occur in a word's unaltered form.\n</div>\nWhen needed, the conventions for marking tone in written Oromo are as follows:\n\nTones on long vowels are marked on the first vowel symbol.\n\nIn Oromo, the tone-bearing unit is the mora rather than the vowel of the syllable. A long vowel or a diphthong consists of two morae and can bear two tones. Each mora is defined as being of high or low tone. Only one high tone occurs per word and this must be on the final or penultimate mora. Particles do not have a high tone. (These include prepositions, clitic pronouns for subject and object, impersonal subject pronouns and focus markers.) There are therefore three possible \"accentual patterns\" in word roots.\n\nPhonetically there are three tones: high, low and falling. Rules:\n\nThis use of tone may be characterized as pitch accent. It is similar to that in Somali.\n\nStress is connected with tone. The high tone has strong stress; the falling tone has less stress and the low tone has no stress.\n\n\nWhen a vowel occurs in word-initial position, a glottal stop () is inserted before it.\n\nPhonological changes occur at morpheme boundaries (sandhi) for specific grammatical morphemes. There may be assimilation.\n\n\n"}

N. Oak, was an Indian writer, journalist and Indian National Army freedom fighter, notable for his Hindu-centric historical revisionism. Oak's \"Institute for Rewriting Indian History\" issued a quarterly periodical called \"Itihas Patrika\" in the 1980s.\n\nOak's claims, e.g. that Christianity and Islam are both derivatives of Hinduism, or that Vatican City, Kaaba, Westminster Abbey and the Taj Mahal were once Hindu temples to Shiva, and their reception in Indian popular culture have been noted by observers of contemporary Indian society. In addition to this Oak again asserted that the Vatican was allegedly originally a Vedic creation called Vatika and that the Papacy was also originally a Vedic Priesthood. He wrote books in three languages. History books written by him have inspired several court cases to correct the history based on his theories.\n\nOak was born in 1917 at Indore in the erstwhile Princely State of Indore, British India. According to his own account, he completed an M.A. (Agra) and a law degree (LL.B. Mumbai), was an official in the Ministry for Information, and wrote various journalistic pieces. Dozens of blogs and websites refer to him as \"Professor\" P. N. Oak. Before joining the army, he had also worked as an English tutor at Fergusson College in Pune. \n\nLater he joined the army and was posted in Singapore. During World War II, he was at first with the army of the British Raj in British Malaya at the age of 24. He joined the Indian National Army after Singapore fell to the Japanese. He acted as an assistant to Subhas Chandra Bose in the Indian National Army and then as an ADC to General J. R. Bhonsle, chief of the Indian National Army. He also worked as a commentator for the Azad Hind Radio.\n\n\"From 1947 to 1974 his profession has been mainly journalism having worked on the editorial staffs of the Hindustan Times and The Statesman, as a Class I Gazetted officer in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, India; and as editor in the Embassy of the United States' Information Service.\" In 1964, he founded an organisation called \"Institute for Rewriting Indian History\".\n\nHe died on 4 December 2007, at 3.30 am at his Pune residence aged 90.\n\nIntent on rectifying what he believes to be \"biased and distorted versions of India's history produced by the invaders and colonizers\", Oak wrote several books and articles on Indian history and founded an \"Institute for Rewriting Indian History\" in 1964.\nAccording to Oak, modern secular and Marxist historians have fabricated \"idealized versions\" of India's past and drained it of its \"Vedic context and content\". Srinivas Aravamudan noted that Oak's work typically resorts to \"deep punning\" – associating Sanskrit sound-alikes with non-Sanskrit religious terms such as \"Vatican\"=\"vatika\" \"hermitage\", \"Christianity\"=\"Krishna-netti or Chrisn-nity\" \"ethics of Krishna or the way of Krishna\" \"Islam\"=\"ishalayam\" \"temple of God\", \"Abraham\" as an aberration of \"Brahma\", and \"George\" as an aberration of Garg. Based on this, Oak claims that both Christianity and Islam allegedly originated as distortions of \"Vedic\" beliefs.\n\nOak finds some mention in passing as trustworthy in academic literature on the Hindutva wing of Hindu nationalism. Aravamudan (2005) calls him a \"mythistorian\" whose life's work may be summarised by the title of his work \"World Vedic Heritage: A History of Histories, Presenting a Unique Unified Field Theory of History that from the Beginning of Time the World Practised Vedic and Spoke Sanskrit\". \n\nEdwin Bryant in his work on Indo-Aryan theory says \"The various scholars whose work I have examined here are a disparate group. They range from brilliant intellectuals like Aurobindo, to professional scholars like B. B. Lal, to what most academics would consider “crackpots,” like P. N. Oak. 1 The primary feature they share is that they have taken it upon themselves to oppose the theory of Aryan invasions and migrations—hence the label Indigenous Aryanism.\" Giles Tillotson describes Oak's work as a \"startling piece of pseudo-scholarship\".\n\nWhile Oak's theories have been rejected by some, they have found a popular following among others, specially among some members of India's Hindutvas, (N. Ram, editor of \"The Hindu\", calls him a \"Sangh historian\"), Indocentrists and the Hare Krishnas mainly but not only represented by author Stephen Knapp. Art historian Rebecca Brown describes Oak's books as \"revisionist history as subtle as Captain Russell's smirk\" (referring to a character in the Hindi movie \"Lagaan\").\n\nAlthough not anti-government in nature, Oak's book \"Some Blunders in Indian Historical Research\" was banned from the Parliament's library by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha (lower House) as noted in news archives.\nThere are also other claims of government suppression, e.g. \"Allegedly, Indira Gandhi's government tried to ban [Oak's book on Taj Mahal] and some would say the Indian government has been politically motivated in suppressing this theory\".\n\nOak claims that Christianity was originally a Vedic religion following Krishna and claims that Christianity was originally known by either the names Chrisn-nity or Krishna-neeti (with Oak alleging these meant \"The way of Krishna\" or \"The Justice of Lord Krishna\") these generally follow in line with Oak's other theories and claims that the Vatican was allegedly originally called Vatika and that the Papacy was originally a \"Vedic Priesthood\" until Constantine the Great around 312 A.D killed the \"Vedic pontiff\" and installed in his place a representative of the tiny Christian sect. Specifically, Oak's followers make the following claims about what they claim as alleged Krishna-neeti. \"Jesus went to India between ages 13 and 30 to learn Krishna-neeti (Christianity) from sages.\"\n\nIn his book \"Taj Mahal: The True Story\", Oak claims that the Taj Mahal was originally a Shiva temple and a Rajput palace named \"Tejo Mahalaya\" seized by Shah Jahan and adopted as a tomb. He argues that may be this temple was built by Indian King Jai Singh I. He says that Mahal is a word to describe a royal palace and not a tomb and after seizure by Shah Jahan, the name was changed to Taj Mahal.\n\nThe Taj, Oak says, is a \"typical illustration of how all historic buildings and townships from Kashmir to Cape Comorin though of Hindu origin have been ascribed to this or that Muslim ruler or courtier\". He goes on to propose Hindu origins for the tombs of Humayun, Akbar and I'timād-ud-Daulah and \"all historic buildings\" in India as well as Vatican City, the Kaaba and Stonehenge.\n\nOak says that well-known western authorities on architecture including Ernest Binfield Havell, Mrs. Kenoyer and William Wilson Hunter have written that the Taj Mahal is built in the Hindu temple style, asserting that Havel says the plan of the ancient Hindu temple of Java, the Prambanan, is identical with that of the Taj Mahal. Also, he argues out that the octagonal shape of the Taj Mahal has a special Hindu significance, because Hindus alone have special names for the eight directions and the celestial guards assigned to them. He argues that the finial of the Taj Mahal is a trishula with a Kalasha, holding two bent mango leaves and a coconut, which is a sacred Hindu motif.\n\nOak claims that Hindu ornaments and symbols were effaced from the Taj, whose sealed chambers hold the remnants, including a lingam, of the original temple, and that Mumtaz Mahal was not buried at her cenotaph.\n\nIn support of these claims, Oak presents radiocarbon dating results of the wood from the riverside doorway of the Taj, quotes from European travellers' accounts and the Taj's Hindu architectural features. Oak further alleges that eyewitness accounts of the Taj Mahal's construction as well as Shah Jahan's construction orders and voluminous financial records are elaborate frauds meant to hide its Hindu origin.\n\nOak petitioned the Indian parliament demanding that the Taj be declared a Hindu monument and that cenotaphs and sealed apartments be opened to determine whether lingams or other remains were hidden in them. According to Oak, the government of India's refusal to allow him unfettered access amounts to a conspiracy against Hinduism. The Indian government has maintained that out of respect for the dead, unnecessary openings of cenotaphs and sealed rooms cannot be allowed.\n\nOak's denial of Islamic architecture in India has been described as one of the \"more extreme manifestations of anti-Muslim sentiment\" in Maharashtrian popular culture. K. N. Panikkar locates Oak's work in the Hindutva movement's attempt to foster a communal understanding of Indian history. Tapan Raychaudhuri has referred to him as \"a 'historian' much respected by the Sangh Parivar.\"\n\nIn 2000 India's Supreme Court dismissed Oak's petition to declare that a Hindu king had built the Taj Mahal by saying he had a \"bee in his bonnet\" about the Taj. Till date, as of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by Oak's theory. In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.\n\nGiles Tillotson calls Oak's claims as a \"desperate bid to assign a new meaning to the Taj\" and \"pseudo-scholarship\". He states that Oak interprets the statements of \"Padshahnama\" about Shah Jahan's purchase of the land for the Taj from Jai Singh I upon where a mansion built by an ancestor of the Raja earlier existed, to claim that Taj Mahal was a wonder of ancient Hinduism. Tillotoson adds that no evidence is offered by Oak to redate it to thirteen centuries earlier. He adds that the technical know-how to construct structural buildings didn't exist in pre-Mughal India, the only surviving architecture being rock-cut or monolithic. He points that Oak later dropped this claim and claimed it to be from 12th century. He adds that Oak claims Mughals built nothing and only converted Hindu buildings. In relation to similarity with buildings of West Asia, Oak also claims them all to be \"products of Hindu architecture\".\n\nIn a 13-page pamphlet titled \"Was Kaaba a Hindu Temple?\", Oak derives a claim of a \"Vedic past of Arabia\" based on an inscription mentioning the legendary Indian king Vikramāditya that Oak claims was found inside a dish inside the Kaaba. According to Oak, the text of the alleged inscription is taken from the page 315 of an anthology of poetry entitled \"Sayar-ul-Okul\" (\"Se’-arul Oqul\" meaning the \"memorable words\"), compiled in 1742 on the orders of a \"Sultan Salim\" (the actual Sultan at the time being Mahmud I, sultan Selim III lived from 1761 to 1808) from the earlier work of prophet Muhammed's uncle Amr ibn Hishām (poetic name \"Abu al-Ḥakam\" or ابوالحكم meaning the \"Father of wisdom\") who had refused to convert to Islam, and, first modern version published in 1864 in Berlin and a subsequent edition was published in Beirut in 1932. Oak goes on to state that the anthology is kept in the \"Makhtab-e-Sultania Library\" (Galatasaray Mekteb-i Sultani or Galatasaray Imperial School) in Istanbul in Turkey, which is now also known as Galatasaray Lisesi school.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Palenquero is the only Spanish-based creole in Latin America. The ethnic group which speaks this creole consisted of 7,470 people in 2005. Palenquero is spoken in Colombia, in the village of San Basilio de Palenque which is southeast of Cartagena, and in some neighbourhoods of Barranquilla, and has existed for approximately three to four centuries.\n\nThe village was formed by escaped slaves (Maroons) and sometimes Native Americans around 1604 under the leadership of Benkos Biojo. These slaves ran from Cartagena, building their own communities to the south. \n\nSince many slaves had not been subjected to a lot of contact with people of European descent, the \"palenqueros\" spoke Creole languages constructed from the Spanish language and their own African ones.\n\nSpanish speakers are usually unable to understand Palenquero, even though Palenquero borrows many lexical elements from the Spanish language. The people of Palenque tend to speak Spanish to outsiders and Palenquero to specific individuals within their community. The speakers kept this language secret from outsiders on purpose. This language is a powerful identity marker for the speakers. It is a way for the people to differentiate themselves from non-speakers. Those who speak both languages can switch from Palenquero to Spanish, and vice versa, making them two distinct languages and not just a dialectical difference. For a long time, individuals who heard this language being spoken thought of it as \"broken Spanish\".\n\nTen percent of the population under 25 years of age spoke Palenquero in 1998. It is more commonly spoken by the elderly. It's sole substrate is likely the Kikongo language, which is spoken in the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola. Palenquero words like \"\", which means cattle, are found in several Bantu languages.\n\nSimilar to several other creole languages, Palenquero grammar lacks inflectional morphology, meaning that nouns, adjectives, verbs and determiners are almost always invariant.\n\nGrammatical gender is non-existent, and adjectives derived from Spanish default to the masculine form: \"lengua africano\" ‘African language’.\n\nPlurality is marked with the particle \"ma\". (\"for example: ma posá 'houses' \"). This particle is believed to derive from Kikongo, a Bantu language, and is the sole Kikongo-derived inflection present in Palenquero. The younger speakers of Palenquero utilize \"ma\" for plurality more so than the speakers that came before them.\n\nThis particle is usually dropped with cardinal numbers greater than 2: \"ma ndo baka\" ‘two cows’ but \"tresi año\" ‘13 years’.\n\nThere are four copulas in Palenquero: \"e\", \"ta\", \"jue\", and \"senda\". \"E\" roughly corresponds to 'ser' in Spanish and is used for permanent states, and \"ta\" is similar to the Spanish 'estar' in that it used for temporary states and locatives. \"Jue\" is used as a copula for nouns and \"senda\" is only found with predicative nouns and adjectives referring to permanent states.\n\nExamples:\n\nSome 300 words of African origin have been identified in Palenquero, with many believed to originate in the Kikongo language. A comprehensive list and proposed etymologies are provided in Moñino and Schwegler's \"Palenque, Cartagena y Afro-Caribe: historia y lengua\" (2002). Many of the words that come from African origin, include plant, animal, insect and landscape names. Another handful of words are believed to originate from Portuguese (\"for example: mai 'mother'; ten 'has'; ele 'he/she'; bae 'go').\"\n\nSome sample words in Palenque alongside Spanish and English translations include:\nThe Lord's Prayer in Palenque:\n\n"}

Mariano was a Katipunan member. Mariano was the son of Petronilo Mariano and Dionisia Geronimo.\n\nMariano received his high school education at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila (now known as the Ateneo de Manila University) and at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. Mariano studied bookkeeping at the Escuela de Artes y Oficios. Mariano received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the Liceo de Manila (now known as the Manila Central University).\n\nMariano was influenced by José Dizon, a Katipunan leader and typography and stereography shop owner, in joining the Katipunan. Mariano worked for Dizon in the said printing shop. Mariano joined the Filipino revolution in 1896. However, Mariano decided not to fight till the end. In 1898, Mariano became a public servant during the First Philippine Republic, wherein he acted as the right-hand man of Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista. Bautista was the adviser to General Emilio Aguinaldo, the president of the First Philippine Republic. As a patriot, Mariano was one of the founders of the organization known as the Asociacion Pro Patria.\n\nAt a time when the Tagalog Theater was beginning to evolve, Mariano pursued a career as a playwright by writing zarzuelas in the Tagalog language. Mariano became a translator of literary works into the Tagalog language. Apart from being a zarzuela author and translator, Mariano wrote poetry, short stories, dramas, and operettas. Mariano focused on subjects of romance, social conditions, and the hopes of the Filipino people. Mariano used symbolism in his works. Mariano’s works as a playwright were performed at theaters such as the Zorrilla Theater, the Manila Grand Opera House, and the Rizal Theater in Tondo, Manila. Mariano’s play, \"Sampaguita\" (\"Jazmine\"), was shown at the Zorilla Theater in 1901. His one-act drama, \"Ang Pakakak\" (\"The Tuba\"), was presented at the Manila Grand Opera House on 7 July 1913, and his \"Ang Silanganan\" (\"The East\" or \"The Levant\"), another one-act drama, was performed at the Rizal Theater 30 December 1904.\n\nArmed with his experience in printing, Mariano utilized his skills at the Imprenta de Malolos, a printing press located at Barasoain in Malolos, Bulacan. He became the manager of the Imprenta de Malolos. As a journalist, Mariano wrote articles for periodicals such as the \"El Heraldo de la Revolucion\" (The Herald of the Revolution) and the \"Ang Kaibigan ng Bayan\" (The Friend of the Nation). Mariano edited and wrote for other newspapers after the war. The post-war periodicals Mariano had been active in included \"Los Obreros\", \"Ang Paggawa\", \"Katwiran\", \"Lunas ng Bayan\", \"El Renacimiento Filipino\", \"La Vanguardia\", and \"Taliba\".\n\nAs a translator, Mariano translated into the Tagalog language operas such as \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" and the third act of \"La traviata\". Mariano translated José Rizal's novels, namely \"Noli Me Tángere\" and \"El filibusterismo\", from the Spanish originals.\n\nAs a playwright and a journalist, Mariano became a member of literary organizations during his lifetime. Among the organizations Mariano became associated with included the Union de Artistas (Artists Union), the Union de Impresores (Printers' Union), the Buklod na Ginto (Gold Circle), the Aklatang Bayan (National Library), and the Lupong Tagapagpalaganap ng Akademya ng Wikang Tagalog (Board of Spreaders of the Academy of the Tagalog Language).\n\nMariano succumbed to the effects and complications of a neck tumor and died in 1935.\n\nThe following is an enumeration of the plays that Mariano authored:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4283315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4283315", "title": "Phonocentrism", "text": "Phonocentrism\n\nPhonocentrism is the belief that sounds and speech are inherently superior to, or more primary than, written language. Those who espouse phonocentric views maintain that spoken language is the primary and most fundamental method of communication whereas writing is merely a derived method of capturing speech. Many also believe that spoken language is inherently richer and more intuitive than written language. These views also impact perceptions of sign languages – especially in the United States. Oralism is the belief that deaf students should use sounds, speech reading, and primarily English instead of signs in their education. Alexander Graham Bell is a well known proponent for oralism of the deaf – such phonocentristic views are rejected by the Deaf community. Phonocentrism in the context of deafness is referred to as audism.\n\nSome writers have argued that philosophers such as Plato, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Ferdinand de Saussure have promoted phonocentric views. Walter Ong, who has also expressed support for the idea of phonocentrism, has argued that the culture of the United States is particularly non-phonocentric.\n\nSome philosophers and linguists, notably including the philosopher Jacques Derrida, have used the term \"phonocentrism\" to criticize what they see as a disdain for written language. Derrida has argued that phonocentrism developed because the immediacy of speech has been regarded as closer to the presence of subjects than writing. He believed that the binary opposition between speech and writing is a form of logocentrism.\n\nThe philosopher John Searle has argued that Plato expressed some skepticism about the value of writing relative to speech. The rhetorician and philosopher Walter Ong also believes that Plato was phonocentric. He argues that Plato had a clear preference for \"orality over writing.\" However, he notes that Plato's belief in phonocentrism was both contrived and defended textually, and is therefore paradoxical.\n\nRousseau also held views that have since been characterized as phonocentric. He discussed the topic in \"Essay on the Origin of Languages\". He believed that speech was a more natural form of communication than writing, which he viewed as a somewhat parasitic and unhealthy derivation of speech.\n\nThe linguist Leonard Bloomfield has also expressed the belief that spoken languages are the primary form of language, and that written languages should be viewed as derived from them. He argued that \"writing is not language, but merely a way of recording language.\"\n\nSaussure believed that speech should be treated as the primary topic of linguistics. He believed that writing was given too much attention in the field of linguistics. In \"Course in General Linguistics,\" Saussure argued that \"language and writing are two distinct systems of signs.\" He believed that both systems influenced each other, but that writing could obscure language. He argued that writing obscures how pronunciation forms because of its influence on pronunciation. Saussure drew a distinction between phonetic languages and languages such as Chinese in which a single character represents a word. He believed that only phonetic languages cause problems for linguists.\n\nOng has argued that American society is particularly opposed to phonocentrism. He believes that one cause of this is the fact that written documents, such as the United States Constitution, form a key part of American national identity. He also notes that many Americans view the reality of words as defined by dictionaries rather than by vocal speech. He has stated, \"We are so literate in ideology that we think writing comes naturally. We have to remind ourselves from time to time that writing is completely and irremediably artificial.\"\n\nOng believes that writing is necessary for transmitting knowledge in a technological culture. He maintains that speech should be viewed as primary because it is drawn from the unconscious while writing requires conscious attention: \"Speech is structured through the entire fabric of the human person. Writing depends on consciously contrived rules.\" He also states that writing and speech are each privileged in specific ways, and that they depend upon each other for identification and clarity.\n\nDerrida believed that the fields of philosophy, literature, anthropology, and linguistics had become highly phonocentric. He argued that phonocentrism was an important example of what he saw as Western philosophy's logocentrism. He maintained that phonocentrism developed due to the human desire to determine a central means of authentic self-expression. He argued that speech is no better than writing, but is assigned that role by societies that seek to find a transcendental form of expression. This form of expression is said to allow one to better express transcendental truths and to allow one to understand key metaphysical ideas. Derrida believed that phonocentric cultures associate speech with a time before meaning was corrupted by writing. He saw phonocentrism as part of the influence of Romanticism, specifically its belief in a time in which people lived in harmony and unity with nature. Derrida did not believe that there was any ideal state of unity with nature. He also argued that speech suffers from many of the same inherent flaws as writing.\n\nGayatri Chakravorty Spivak has characterized Derrida's opposition to phonocentrism as part of his campaign against \"human egocentricity.\" Derrida points out that the expression of human views is often dominated by the voices of humans. He also noted that writing frees expression from the human voice and is more exterior and stable than speech. He believed that this makes it a more effective carrier of meaning. Randal Holme has argued that Derrida preferred writing because he associated it with \"the construction of meaning and the creation of category.\"\n\nDerrida identified the often perceived difference between the value of speaking versus writing as one of the key binary oppositions of logocentrism. He attempted to deconstruct this opposition by arguing that speech can be seen as derived from writing as easily as writing is seen as derived from speech. He wrote that societies often make determinations that unfairly casts writing as an inferior method of communication and self-expression.\n\nDerrida insisted that the written word has its own value, and is likely not \"the simple 'supplement to the spoken word.'\" In \"Of Grammatology\" he uses this method of analysis to critique the views that Rousseau expressed in \"Essay on the Origin of Languages\". Derrida argued that Rousseau's views were contradictory and often undermined his arguments.\n\nSearle has criticized Derrida's claims of historical opposition to Phonocentrism. Searle believes that many philosophers, including Aristotle, Gottfried Leibniz, Gottlob Frege, and Bertrand Russell, have \"tended to emphasize written language as the more perspicuous vehicle of logical relations.\" He argues that support for ordinary speech over written language only emerged in the 1950s with the advent of Ordinary language philosophy. He also contends that Derrida makes sweeping misinformed claims about the history of writing.\n\nGeoffrey Hartman has also criticized Derrida's accounts of phonocentrism. He has argued that Derrida failed to provide an account of the historical forces that have influenced phonocentric and non-phonocentric cultures. Ong has expressed some agreement with Hartman's critique. Though he describes Derrida's view as \"brilliant and to a degree serviceable,\" he believes that it \"plays with the paradoxes of textuality alone and in historical isolation.\" Though Ong believes that it is impossible to separate writing from its pretext, he contends that \"this does not mean that text can be reduced to orality.\"\n\n\n"}

The saltillo is often spelled with an apostrophe, though it is sometimes spelled (with either pronunciation) , or, when pronounced , . The spelling of the glottal stop with an apostrophe-like character most likely originates from transliterations of the Arabic hamza. It has also been spelled with a grave accent over the preceding vowel in some Nahuatl works, following Horacio Carochi (1645).\n\nThe saltillo represents a phoneme in many other indigenous languages of the Americas and so its presence or absence can change the meaning of a word. However, there is no saltillo in Standard Spanish, so the sound is often imperceptible to Spanish-speakers, and Spanish writers usually did not write it when transcribing Mexican languages: Nahuatl \"in a fire\" and \"he ascends\" were both written \"tleco\".\n\nThe saltillo symbol is also being used in at least one Southeast Asian language, Central Sinama of the Philippines and Malaysia.

In earlier versions of Unicode, saltillo was provisionally represented by such characters as . Typists who are unfamiliar with Unicode frequently use an apostrophe instead, but that can cause problems in computers because apostrophe is a punctuation mark, not a word-building character, and the ambiguous use of apostrophe for two different functions can make automated processing of the text difficult. The Unicode character for saltillo is not included in the Unicode packages found in mobile phones, which also makes typists required to revert to the apostrophe to avoid display issues for mobile users.\n\n\n"}

Semiotics, tied closely to the structuralism pioneered by Ferdinand de Saussure, was extremely influential in the development of literary theory out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.\n\nThe early forms of literary semiotics grew out of formalist approaches to literature, especially Russian formalism, and structuralist linguistics, especially the Prague school. Notable early semiotic authors included Vladimir Propp, Algirdas Julius Greimas, and Viktor Shklovsky. These critics were concerned with a formal analysis of narrative forms which would resemble a literary mathematics, or at least a literary syntax, as far as possible. They proposed various formal notations for narrative components and transformations and attempted a descriptive taxonomy of existing stories along these lines.\n\nPropp's \"Morphology of the Folktale\" (orig. Russian pub. 1928; English trans. 1958) provides an example of the formal and systematic approach. In successive chapters, Propp analyzes the characters, plot events, and other elements of traditional folktales (primarily from Russia and Eastern Europe). For each of these key components he provides a letter designation (with superscripts to designate specific subtypes). He proceeds to analyze individual tales by transposing them into this notation and then to generalize about their structure. For example:\n\nHe then gives the complete structure of this story in one line of notation, the analysis complete and ready to be compared systematically with other tales:\n\nLater semiotic approaches to literature have often been less systematic (or, in some special cases such as Roland Barthes's \"S/Z\", they have been so specifically and exhaustively systematic as to render the possibility of a complete literary semiotics doubtful). As structuralist linguistics gave way to a post-structuralist philosophy of language which denied the scientific ambitions of the general theory of signs, semiotic literary criticism became more playful and less systematic in its ambitions. Still, some authors harbor more scientific ambition for their literary schemata than others. Later authors in the semiotic tradition of literary criticism include Tzvetan Todorov, Mikhail Bakhtin, Roland Barthes, Julia Kristeva, Michael Riffaterre, and Umberto Eco.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4768880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4768880", "title": "Subject–object–verb", "text": "Subject–object–verb\n\nIn linguistic typology, a subject–object–verb (SOV) language is one in which the subject, object, and verb of a sentence always or usually appear in that order. If English were SOV, \"Sam oranges ate\" would be an ordinary sentence, as opposed to the actual Standard English \"Sam ate oranges\".\n\nThe term is often loosely used for ergative languages like Adyghe and Basque that really have agents instead of subjects.\n\nAmong natural languages with a word order preference, SOV is the most common type (followed by subject–verb–object; the two types account for more than 75% of natural languages with a preferred order).\n\nLanguages that have SOV structure include Ainu, Akkadian, Amharic, Armenian, Assamese, Aymara, Azerbaijani, Basque, Bengali, Burmese, Burushaski, Cherokee, Dakota, Dogon languages, Elamite, Ancient Greek, Gujarati, Hajong, Hindi, Hittite, Hopi, Ijoid languages, Itelmen, Japanese, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Korean, Kurdish, Classical Latin, Lakota, Manchu, Mande languages, Marathi, Mongolian, Navajo, Nepali, Newari, Nivkh, Nobiin, Pāli, Pashto, Persian, Punjabi, Quechua, Senufo languages, Seri, Sicilian, Sindhi, Sinhalese, Sunuwar and most other Indo-Iranian languages, Somali and virtually all other Cushitic languages, Sumerian, Tibetan and nearly all other Tibeto-Burman languages, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and all other Dravidian languages, Tigrinya, Turkic languages, Turkish, Urdu, almost all Uto-Aztecan languages, Uzbek, Yukaghir, and virtually all Caucasian languages.\n\nStandard Mandarin is SVO, but for simple sentences with a clear context, word order is flexible enough to allow for SOV or OSV. German and Dutch are considered SVO in conventional typology and SOV in generative grammar. For example, in German, a basic sentence such as \"Ich sage etwas über Karl\" (\"I say something about Karl\") is in SVO word order. When a noun clause marker like \"dass\" or \"wer\" (in English, \"that\" or \"who\" respectively) is used, the verb appears at the end of the sentence for the word order SOV. A possible example in SOV word order would be \"Ich sage, dass Karl einen Gürtel gekauft hat.\" (A literal English translation would be \"I say that Karl a belt bought has.\") This is V2 word order.\n\nA rare example of SOV word order in English is \"I (subject) thee (object) wed (verb)\" in the wedding vow \"With this ring, I thee wed.\"\n\nSOV languages have a strong tendency to use postpositions rather than prepositions, to place auxiliary verbs after the action verb, to place genitive noun phrases before the possessed noun, to place a name before a title or honorific (\"James Uncle\" and \"Johnson Doctor\" rather than \"Uncle James\" and \"Doctor Johnson\") and to have subordinators appear at the end of subordinate clauses. They have a weaker but significant tendency to place demonstrative adjectives before the nouns they modify. Relative clauses preceding the nouns to which they refer usually signals SOV word order, but the reverse does not hold: SOV languages feature prenominal and postnominal relative clauses roughly equally. SOV languages also seem to exhibit a tendency towards using a time–manner–place ordering of adpositional phrases.\n\nIn linguistic typology one can usefully distinguish two types of SOV languages in terms of their type of marking:\n\n\nIn practice, of course, the distinction between these two types is far from sharp. Many SOV languages are substantially double-marking and tend to exhibit properties intermediate between the two idealised types above.\n\nMany languages that have shifted to SVO-word order from the original SOV retain (at least to an extent) the properties, for example the Finnish language (high usage of postpositions etc.)\n\nBasque in short sentences, usually, subject or agent–object–verb; in long sentences, usually, subject or agent-verb-objects):\n\nBurmese is an analytic language.\nGenerally, Chinese varieties all feature SVO word order. However, especially in Standard Mandarin, SOV is tolerated as well. There is even a special structure to form an SOV sentence.\n\nNote that SOV is generally used to emphasize the object, such as in this case, where the apple is a very specific apple.\n\nSOV structure is also widely used in railway contact in order to clarify the objective of the order.\n\nFurthermore, in Standard Mandarin, SOV is used in the passive voice, where the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence, and the subject of the active sentence becomes the object of the passive sentence.\n\nDutch is SOV combined with V2 word order. The non-finite verb (infinitive or participle) remains in final position, but the finite (i.e. inflected) verb is moved to the second position. Simple verbs look like SVO, non-finite verbs (participles, infinitives) and compound verbs follow this pattern:\n\nPure SOV order is found in subordinate clauses:\n\nThe French language usually uses a subject–verb–object structure but places proclitics before the verb when using most pronouns, which is sometimes mistaken for SOV word order.\nThe Georgian language isn't extremely rigid with regards to word order, but is typically either SOV or SVO.\nGerman is SOV combined with V2 word order. The non-finite verb (infinitive or participle) remains in final position, but the finite (i.e. inflected) verb is moved to the second position. Simple verbs look like SVO, compound verbs follow this pattern:\n\nThe word order changes also depending on whether the phrase is a main clause or a dependent clause. In dependent clauses, the word order is always entirely SOV (cf. also Inversion):\n\n're\" is a particle that indicates the accusative case and 'sei' indicates past tense declarative. Here, 'e\" is pronounced as the 'i' in 'girl' and 'ei' is pronounced as the 'ay' in 'say'.\n\nHungarian word order is free, although the meaning slightly changes. Almost all permutations of the following sample are valid, but with stress on different parts of the meaning.\nThe Italian language usually uses a subject–verb–object structure, but when an enclitic pronoun is used, this comes before the verb and the auxiliary.\n\nThe markers が (ga) and を ((w)o) are, respectively, subject and object markers for the words that precede them. Technically, the sentence could be translated a number of ways (\"I open a box\", \"It is I who open the boxes\", etc.), but this does not affect the SOV analysis.\n\nJapanese has some flexibility in word order, so an OSV is also possible. (箱を私が開けます。)\n\nLike German and Dutch the Indo-Aryan language Kashmiri is SOV combined with V2 word order. The non-finite verb (infinitive or participle) remains in final position, but the finite (i.e. inflected) part of the verb appears in second position. Simple verbs look like SVO, whereas auxiliated verbs are discontinuous and adhere to this pattern:\n\nSince Kashmiri is a V2 language if the word \"tsũũţh\" 'apple' comes first then the subject \"kuur\" 'girl' must follow the auxiliary \"chhi\" 'is': \"tsũũţh chhi kuur khyevaan\" [Lit. \"Apples is girl eating.\"]\n\nThe word order changes also depending on whether the phrase is in a main clause or in certain kinds of dependent clause. For instance, in relative clauses, the word order is SOVAux:\n\nLike in Japanese, OSV is possible too. (Кітапті Дастан оқыды.)\n\n'가 (ga)/이 (i)' is a particle that indicates the nominative case. '를 (reul)/을 (eul)' is a particle that indicates the accusative case. '-ㄴ다 (nda)' indicates present tense declarative. The consonant 'ㄹ (l)' in the verb stem (열-) is dropped before the suffix.\n\n※ Here, '나 (na, I (pronoun))' is changed to '내 (nae)' before '가 (ga)'.\n\nClassical Latin was an inflected language and had a very flexible word order and sentence structure, but the most usual word order in formal prose was SOV.\n\nAgain, there are multiple valid translations (such as \"a slave\") that do not affect the overall analysis.\n\n\nPortuguese is an SVO language, but it has some SOV constructs.\n\nIn case of proclisis:\n\n\"Todos aqui te amam\". Literally: \"Everybody here loves you\".\n\n\"Aquilo me entristeceu\". Literally: \"It saddened me\".\n\nWhen using a temporal adverb, optionally with the negative:\n\n\"Nós já [não] os temos\". Literally: \"We already [not] them have\". Meaning: (Positive) \"We already have them\". (Negative) \"We do not have them anymore.\"\n\n\"Nós ainda [não] os temos\". Literally: \"We still [not] them have\". Meaning: (Positive) \"We still have them\". (Negative) \"We have do not them yet.\".\n\nWhen answering the phone:\n\"Sim, sou eu\". Literally: \"Yes, am I\". Meaning: \"Yes, it's I\"\n\nSVO form: \"Sou eu mesmo/mesma\", literally \"It's me [indeed]\".\n\nThere is an infix construction for the future and conditional tenses:\n\n\"Eu fá-lo-ei amanhã\". Literally: \"I do-it-will tomorrow\". Meaning: \"I will do it tomorrow\".\n\nSVO form: \"Eu hei-de fazê-lo amanhã\" or \"eu farei o mesmo amanhã\"\n\nOn composed sentences, it is also allowed the SOV order for the last part in some situations like:\n\n\"Ela não os comeu, mas comi-os eu\". Literally: \"She did not eat them, but ate them I\". Meaning: \"She did not eat them, but I did\".\n\nSVO form: \"Ela não comeu os mesmos, mas eu comi [a eles]\".\n\nRussian is an inflected language and very flexible in word order; it allows all possible word combinations. However, it is generally considered a SVO language.\n\nfor example: Она любит его, любит его oна, любит oна его, and virtually all re-orderings of Russian sentence order are correct although this is often used in different situations to emphasize particular constituents of a sentence. Who loves him? 'she' is the one who loves him (emphatic meaning). In this way any part of the sentence can be emphasized without changing basic meaning (a convenience created by Russian's noun case system)\n\nSaṃskṛtam is an inflected language and very flexible in word order; it allows all possible word combinations. However, it is generally considered a SOV language.\nSomali generally uses the subject–object–verb structure when speaking formally.\nThe Spanish language usually uses a subject–verb–object structure, but when an enclitic pronoun is used, this comes before the verb and the auxiliary. Sometimes, in dual-verb constructions involving the infinitive and the gerund, the enclitic pronoun can be put before both verbs, or attached to the end of the second verb.\n\nThe தான் (tān) and யை (yai) are, respectively, nominative and accusative markers for the subject and object that respectively precede them. The தான் (tān) is optional in the Tamil language. The sentence may literally be translated as 'I [who am] the box [which] open shall.'\n\nThe sentence may also be translated, although less frequently, as பெட்டியை நான் தான் திறப்பேன் (Peṭṭiyai nāṉ tāṉ tiṟappēn), or simply, பெட்டியை திறப்பேன் (Peṭṭiyai tiṟappēn) as Tamil is a null-subject language because the indicative verb at the end of the word indicates the 1st person subject. This follows the object-subject-verb (OSV) pattern.\n\nThe Tigrinya language usually uses a subject–verb–object structure. \nLike all other Turkic languages, Turkish has flexibility in word order, so any order is possible. For example, in addition to the SOV order above, this sentence could also be constructed as OSV (\"Elmayı Yusuf yedi.\"), OVS (\"Elmayı yedi Yusuf.\"), VSO (\"Yedi Yusuf elmayı.\"), VOS (\"Yedi elmayı Yusuf.\"), or SVO (\"Yusuf yedi elmayı.\"), but these other orders carry a connotation of emphasis of importance on either the subject, object, or the verb. The SOV order is the \"default\" one that does not connote particular emphasis on any part of the sentence.\n\nThe marker \"ga\" is a dative case marker for the object that precedes it. \nDue to flexibility in word order in Uzbek, it is possible to transform the sentence into OSV as well (\"Xivaga Anvar ketdi\" / \"It was Anvar who went to Khiva\").\n\n"}

{"id": "27740460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27740460", "title": "Wahgi language", "text": "Wahgi language\n\nWahgi is a Trans–New Guinea language of the Chimbu–Wahgi branch spoken by approximately 100,000 people in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Like other Chimbu languages, Wahgi has some unusual lateral consonants.\n\nThe dental consonants are \"distributed\", with closure along a considerable distance of the vocal tract. This presumably means that they are laminal, and that the alveolar consonants are apical. The dental consonants have palatalized allophones in free variation.\n\nThe description of the (palatalized) dentals suggest they may be alveolo-palatal or something similar. This is further suggested by transitional vowels triggered by , apparently even by its non-palatalized allophone: 'moon', [sic] 'here'.\n\nThe nasal element of the prenasalized consonants is syllabic when not preceded by a vowel, but takes a noncontrastive low tone and is never stressed: 'but', 'we know'. Prenasalized consonants are perceived as single segments word-initially, but as nasal + stop word-medially.\n\nNasals and semivowels have no notable allophony, apart from the optional palatalization of . The other consonants vary markedly, with most variants being positional:\n\nThe southern Kuma dialect has these three laterals, though the alveolar is rather uncommon. (The northern Danga dialect has two laterals, dental fricative and alveolar flap.) The dental and velar laterals assimilate to or before dental and alveolar consonants; the alveolar only to before alveolar consonants. In locational forms with a suffix beginning with /t/, the /t/ is elided following the lateral, so that on the surface Wahgi distinguishes dental vs alveolar lateral fricatives and alveolar lateral fricatives vs flaps.\n\nAll vowels neutralize to in final unstressed closed syllables (disregarding subsequent \"clitics\").\n\nIn rapid speech, unstressed elide between stressed syllables. For example, in rapid speech is pronounced .\n\nWahgi appears to have three word tones rather than phonemic tone on each syllable. At least one syllable will have a phonetic high tone, with the resulting patterns of high, rising and falling on words of one or two syllables, and peaking, rising and falling on words of three to five syllables. Stress also appears to be contrastive, but analysis is difficult.\n\nOn both monosyllabic and disyllabic words, the three tones are realized as high, rising and falling: [HH], [LH] and [HL]. An analysis of two phonemic syllable tones, HIGH and LOW, is complicated by the appearance of all three word tones on monosyllables with final occlusive codas (and phonetically short vowels).\n\nIn polysyllabic words, \n\nOn trisyllables, the patterns LHL, HLL, and LLH are attested. On tetrasyllables are LLHL, LLLH, and LHHL (that is, LMHL, LLMH, LHHL). On pentasyllables, only two patterns have been found, LLHHH and LLHHL (that is, LMHHH and LMHHL).\n\nWords with six to nine syllables are only attested with a single pattern, a peaking tone (LHL) on the first three syllables followed by a falling tone (LH) stretched out over the remaining syllables. For words of six syllables, this is realized as LHLHLL (phonetically LHLHML); for seven, LHLHLLL; for eight, LHLHHLLL; for nine LHLHHLLLL. In each case, the second syllable (the first high tone) is also stressed, and it is not clear if these are actually double-peaking tones or single peaking tones with preceding stress. Regardless, there does not appear to be any phonemic distinction.\n\nThe maximal syllable in Wahgi is CVCC; the minimal syllable is V, which may be any vowel but . Any consonant may occur in the onset except the three laterals. Any consonant may occur in the coda except the semivowels and /ng/.

Gravity acts on the large mass of the collars to provide the downward force needed for the bits to efficiently break rock. To accurately control the amount of force applied to the bit, the driller carefully monitors the surface weight measured while the bit is just off the bottom of the wellbore. Next, the drillstring (and the drill bit), is slowly and carefully lowered until it touches bottom. After that point, as the driller continues to lower the top of the drillstring, more and more weight is applied to the bit, and correspondingly less weight is measured as hanging at the surface. If the surface measurement shows 20,000 pounds [9080 kg] less weight than with the bit off bottom, then there should be 20,000 pounds force on the bit (in a vertical hole).

The ZADs are organized particularly in areas with an ecological or agricultural dimension, notably in the permanent blockade village against an airport in Notre-Dame-des-Landes. However the name has also been used by occupations in urban areas, e.g.: in Rouen, in Décines-Charpieu. One of the movement's first slogans was \"ZADs everywhere\" and though there are no official figures, in early 2016 there were estimated to have been between 10 and 15 ZADs across France.\n\nThe acronym \"ZAD\" is a détournement of \"deferred development area\" (from French: \"zone d'aménagement différé\"). In 2015, the French term \"zadiste\" (English: Zadist) entered the 2016 edition of \"Le Petit Robert\" dictionary as \"a militant occupying a ZAD to oppose a proposed development that would damage the environment.\"\n\nAppearing in France in the early 2010s, the term was first popularized during the opposition to the airport construction project in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, north of Nantes. The ZAD movement has its origins in challenging large infrastructure projects in defense of the environment, local people's right to decide the future of their territories (at the price, if necessary, of conflict with state power) and the rejection of the capitalist economy. In France, the most famous antecedents of the ZAD movement are the Larzac struggle (1971-1981), the protests against the proposed nuclear power plant at Creys-Malville, in Isère (1977), and at Plogoff in the 70s and 80s.\n\nThe ZADs have multiplied in France after the failed eviction of the Notre-Dame-des-Landes commune in the autumn of 2012.
