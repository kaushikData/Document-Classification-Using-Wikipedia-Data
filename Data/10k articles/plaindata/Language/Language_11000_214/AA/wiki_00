{"id": "5671304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5671304", "title": "Arbëresh language", "text": "Arbëresh language\n\nArbëresh (also known as Arbërisht, Arbërishtja or T'arbrisht) is the language spoken by the Arbëreshë people in Italy. It is a dialect of the Albanian language.\n\nArbëresh derives from a medieval variety of Tosk, which was spoken in southern Albania and from which the modern Tosk is also derived. It follows a similar evolutionary pattern to Arvanitika, a similar language spoken in Greece. Arbëresh is spoken in Southern Italy in the regions of Abruzzi, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise, Apulia and Sicily. All the varieties of Arberesh are closely related to each other but are not always entirely mutually intelligible.\n\nArbëresh retains many features of medieval Albanian from the time before the Ottoman invasion of Albania in the 15th century. It also retains some Greek elements, including vocabulary and pronunciation, most of which it shares with its relative Arvanitika. Many of the conservative features of Arberesh were lost in mainstream Albanian Tosk. For example, it has preserved certain syllable-initial consonant clusters which have been simplified in Standard Albanian (cf. Arbëresh \"gluhë\" ('language/tongue'), vs. Standard Albanian ). Arbëresh most resembles the dialect of Albanian spoken in the south-central region of Albania, particularly that of Çam Albanians.\n\nArbëresh was commonly called 'Albanese' (\"Albanian\" in the Italian language) in Italy until the 1990s. Arbëresh speakers used to have only very vague notions about how related or unrelated their language was to Albanian. Until the 1980s Arbëresh was exclusively a spoken language, except for its written form used in the Italo-Albanian Byzantine Church, and Arbëreshë people had no practical connection with the Standard Albanian language used in Albania, as they did not use this form in writing or in media. When a large number of immigrants from Albania began to enter Italy in the 1990s and came into contact with local Arbëreshë communities, the differences and similarities were for the first time made apparent. \n\nSince the 1980s, some efforts have been organized to preserve the cultural and linguistic heritage of the language.\n\nArbëresh has been replaced by local Romance languages and by Italian in several villages, and in others is experiencing contact induced language shift. Many scholars have produced language learning materials for communities, including those by Zef Skirò Di Maxho who has written two books 'Udha e Mbarë' and 'Udhëtimi', both used in schools in the village of Piana degli Albanesi, Sicily, Gaetano Gerbino wrote Fjalori Arbëresh (Arberesh dictionary), others include Giuseppe Schirò Di Modica, Matteo Mandalà, Zef Chiaramonte, and the only book written in English for the U.S. and U.K. Arberesh diaspora is ‘Everyday Arberesh’ by Martin H. Di Maggio (2013).\nWhile the relation between Arbëresh and standard Albanian is close, the two are not 100% mutually intelligible and there are many false friends, for example:\n\nThe varieties of Arberisht largely correspond with the regions where they are spoken, while some settlements have distinctive features that result in greater or lesser degrees of mutual intelligibility.\n\nThe Siculo-Arbëresh variety is spoken exclusively in the Province of Palermo and in three villages; Piana degli Albanesi, Santa Cristina Gela and Contessa Entellina, while the varieties of Piana and Santa Cristina Gela are similar enough to be entirely mutually intelligible, the variety of Contessa Entellina is not entirely inteliglble. Therefore a further dialect within Siculo-Arberesh known as the Palermitan-Arberisht variety can be identified, as well as a Cosenza variety, a Basilicata variety, a Campania variety represented by the speech of one single settlement of Greci. There is also a Molisan-Arbëresh and an Apulio-Arbëresh.\n\nWithin the Cosenza Calabrian varieties of Arbëresh, the dialect of Vaccarizzo Albanese is particularly distinct. Spoken in the villages of Vaccarizzo Albanese and San Giorgio Albanese in Calabria by approximately 3,000 people. Vaccarizzo Albanian has retained many archaic features of both Gheg and Tosk dialects.\n\nSome features of Arbërish distinguish it considerably from standard Albanian. In some cases these are retentions of older pronunciations.\n\n\nThe letter is pronounced as either a schwa or as a near-close near-back unrounded vowel . So the word is pronounced either or depending on the dialect.\n\n\nArbërisht lacks the close front rounded vowel of Albanian, which is replaced by the close front unrounded vowel . For example ('you') becomes \"ti\", and ('enter') becomes \"hini\".\n\nGJ, Q\n\nThe letters and are pronounced as a palatalized voiced velar plosive and a palatalized voiceless velar plosive , rather than a voiced palatal plosive and a voiceless palatal plosive as in standard Albanian. E.g. the word ('all') is pronounced rather than , ('heaven') is pronounced rather than , and ('albanian') is pronounced .\n\nGL, KL\n\nIn some words, Arbëresh has preserved the consonant clusters and . In Standard Albanian these have mostly become the palatal stops \"gj\" and \"q\". E.g. \"glet\" not ('s/he looks like ... '), \"klumësht\" not ('milk'), and \"klisha\" instead of ('church').\n\nH, HJ\n\nThe letter is pronounced as a voiceless velar fricative (a sound also found in Greek: , 'joy'). As such, the Albanian word ('eat') is pronounced , not . Arbëresh additionally has the palatalized counterpart, . Therefore, the word ('throw') is pronounced . The letter combination is present in a few standard Albanian words (without a voiceless velar fricative), but is not treated as a separate letter of the alphabet as it is in Arbëresh.\n\nLL, G\n\nThe letters and are realised as a voiced velar fricative (also found in Greek: , 'milk'). The vast majority of these words originate in Sicilian, but the sound also occurs in words of Albanian origin. Often is replaced by in the Arbëresh orthography. This feature is very strong that it is carried over into the Italian speech of inhabitants of Piana degli Albanesi and Santa Cristina Gela in words such as \"Grazie\", \"Frigorifero\", \"Gallera\", \"Magro\", \"Gamba\" etc. which are realised respectively as , , , , etc. In Piana degli Albanesi the tendency is to treat Italian loanwords differently from Sicilian, which results in the difference between \"llampjun\", pronounced as (from , 'lamp post'), and \"lampadhin\", pronounced as (from Italian ). In the first example, the becomes because it comes from Sicilian, whereas in the process of transference from the Italian \"ampadina\" to Arbëresh \"lampadhin\", the does not change but the becomes .\n\nIn contrast with standard Albanian Arbëresh has retained an archaic system of final devoicing of consonants. The consonants that change when in final position or before another consonant are the voiced stops \"b, d, g, gj\"; the voiced affricates \"x, xh\"; and the voiced fricatives \"dh, ll, v, z, zh\".\n\nExamples:\n\nStress in Arbëresh is usually on the penultimate syllable, as in Italian.\n\nIn Arbëresh the first person present indicative (e.g. \"I work\") is marked by the word ending in \"NJ\", whereas in Albanian this is normally marked by \"J\". So, 'I live' is \"rrónj in Arbëresh and \"rroj in standard Albanian.\nThe present continuous or gerund differs from Standard Albanian; Arbëresh uses the form \"jam'e bënj\" instead of \"po bej\" (I am doing).\n\nMany Arbëresh words appear to be cognate with their corresponding Greek words\n\nExamples:\n\n\nAlongside the Greek component in Arbëresh, there is an extensive vocabulary derived from Sicilian and other southern Italian regional languages. Many of these words have retained their original meanings where Sicilian has given way to Italian in everyday speech amongst the non-Arbëresh Sicilian people.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nAlongside the Sicilian vocabulary element in Siculo-Arbëresh, the language also includes grammatical rules for the incorporation of Sicilian-derived verbs in Arbëresh, which differs from the rules concerning Albanian lexical material.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nIn the past tense this conjugates as follows:\n\n\nThe Arbëresh diminutive and augmentative system is calqued from Sicilian and takes the form of /-ats(-ɛ)/ = Sic. -azz(u/a); for example \"kalac\" (cavallone/big horse), and the diminutive takes the form of /-tʃ-ɛl(-ɛ) from Sic. /-c-edd(u/a); for example \"vajziçele\" (raggazzina/little girl).\n\nThere are many instances in which Arberisht differs greatly from Standard Albanian, for instance:\n\nThere are many elements of Arberesh grammar that differ considerably from Albanian, for example:\n\nThe name Arbërishte is derived from the ethnonym \"Albanoi\", which in turn comes from the toponym \"Arbëria\" (Greek: Άρβανα), which in the Middle Ages referred to a region in what is today Albania (Babiniotis 1998). Its native equivalents (\"Arbërorë, Arbëreshë\" and others) used to be the self-designation of Albanians in general. Both \"Arbëria\" and \"Albania/Albanian\" go further back to name forms attested since antiquity.\n\nWithin the Arbëresh community the language is often referred to as \"Tarbrisht\" or \"Gjegje.\" The origin of the term \"gjegje\" is uncertain, however this does mean \"listen\" in Arbërisht. Gheg is also the name of one of the two major dialects of Albanian as spoken in the Balkans. The name Gheg is derived from the term initially used by the Orthodox Christian population of pre-Ottoman Albania for confessional denotation when referring to their Catholic neighbors who converted to Catholicism to better resist the Orthodox Serbs.\n\nEvery Italo-Albanian person is given a legal Italian name and also a name in Albanian Arbërisht. Quite often the Arbëresh name is merely a translation of the Italian name. Arbëresh surnames are also used amongst villagers but do not carry any legal weight; the Arbëresh surname is called an \"ofiqe\" in Arbërisht. Some Arbëresh 'ofiqe' are 'Butijuni', 'Pafundi' (literally 'without anus', probably with the meaning of 'without end, infinite'), 'Skarpari' (shoemaker from Italian word 'scarpa'), 'Mut', 'Picanarët', 'Balolërat', 'Kashetërat', 'Lopa', 'Bikubiu' etc.\n\nExamples of Italian names and their Arbëresh equivalents:\n\nThe language is not usually written outside of the church and a few highly educated families, but officials are now using the standard Albanian alphabet, which is used on street signs in villages as well as being taught in schools.\n\nArbëresh verbs often differ, somewhat drastically, from their Standard Albanian counterparts.\n\nDemonstrative pronouns replace nouns once they are able to be understood from their context.\n\nShërbesa e Kurorës - The Arbëresh Marriage Ceremony\n\nZoti : \"Gjergji\", do ti të marsh për gruja \"Linën\" çë ë ke këtú te ana, si urdhuron Klisha Shejte, e të qëndrosh lidhur me atë në të mirën si edhé në të ligën gjithë ditët e gjellës tënde?\n\nPriest: Do you George want to take as your wife Lina who is present here according to the instructions of the Holy Church and to be faithful through the good and the bad all of your life?\n\nDhëndërri: O, e dua!\n\nGroom: Yes, I want!\n\nZoti: Bekuar kloft Perëndia jínë nga herë, naní e për gjithëmonë e për jetë të jetëvet.\n\nPriest: blessed be our God for all time, now and always in the centuries of centuries.\n\nPopulli: Amín.\n\nPeople: Amen.\n\nZoti: Në paqe parkalesjëm t'ën Zonë.\n\nPriest: In peace we pray to the Lord.\n\nPopulli: Lipisí, o i Madh'yn'Zot.\n\nPeople: Our Great God, we beseech you.\n\nBekimi të unazavet\n\nZoti: Me këtë unazë shërbëtori i Perëndis, Gjergji, lidhet me shërbëtorën e Perëndis, Lina, në embër të Atit, të Birit e të Shpirtit Shejt.\n\nPriest: The servant of God, George, is tied to the servant of God, Lina, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n\nZoti jep krinjët e këndon Msalmin 127:\nTë limë atá çë i trëmben t'ynë Zoti e çë jecjën te udhët e Tij.\n\nthe priest delivers the candles and intones Psalm 127\nMake happy those who fear the Lord and may they walk in His ways.\n\nLëvdi tij, o i madh'yn'Zot, lëvdi tij.

{"id": "1252237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1252237", "title": "Artists and repertoire", "text": "Artists and repertoire\n\nArtists and repertoire (A&R) is the division of a record label or music publishing company that is responsible for talent scouting and overseeing the artistic development of recording artists and songwriters. It also acts as a liaison between artists and the record label or publishing company; every activity involving artists to the point of album release is generally considered under the purview, and responsibility, of A&R.\n\nThe A&R division of a record label is responsible for finding new recording artists and bringing those artists to the record company. Personnel in the A&R division are expected to understand the current tastes of the market and to be able to find artists that will be commercially successful. For this reason, A&R people are often young and many are musicians, music journalists or record producers.\n\nAn A&R executive is authorized to offer a record contract, often in the form of a \"deal memo\": a short informal document that establishes a business relationship between the recording artist and the record company. The actual contract negotiations will typically be carried out by rival entertainment lawyers hired by the musician's manager and the record company.\n\nA&R executives rely mostly on the word of mouth of trusted associates, critics and business contacts, rather than on unsolicited demo tapes. They also tend to favor the bands that play in the same city as the record label's offices.\n\nThe A&R division of a record label oversees the recording and format process. This includes helping the artist to find the right record producer, scheduling time in a recording studio and advising the artist on all aspects of making a high-quality recording. They work with the artist to choose the best songs (i.e.) to record. For artists who do not write their own music, the A&R person will assist in finding songs and songwriters. A&R executives maintain contact with their counterparts at music publishing companies to get new songs and material from songwriters and producers.\n\nAs the record nears completion, the A&R department works closely with the artist to determine whether the record is acceptable to the record company. This process may include suggesting that new songs need to be written or that some album tracks need to be re-recorded. A key issue is whether the album has a single: a particular track which can be used to market the record on radio.\n\nOnce the record is completed, the A&R department consults with marketing, promotion, the artist and their management to choose one or more singles to help promote the record.\n\nThe tastes of particular A&R executives have influenced the course of music history. A&R man John H. Hammond discovered Billie Holiday, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin and Bruce Springsteen. Hammond's colleagues were initially skeptical of these artists because none of them appeared to be creating \"commercial\" music. Hammond's instincts proved to be correct, and these artists went on to sell hundreds of millions of records. George Daly, Hammond's colleague at Columbia Records, proved the same instinct with bands as varied as outliers as The Tubes and Tool during his career. Geffen Records' Gary Gersh signed the band Nirvana at a time when alternative rock music was not considered commercial. Gersh was able to convince his co-workers to push the record in spite of their misgivings. In cases like these, A&R people have radically changed the direction of popular musical tastes and introduced large numbers of people to new sounds.\n\nThis kind of prescience is, however, the exception rather than the rule. Historically, A&R executives have tended to sign new artists that fit into recent trends and who resemble acts that are currently successful. For example, Columbia Records' A&R man in the 1950s, Mitch Miller, favored traditional pop singers like Guy Mitchell and Patti Page, and rejected early rock-'n'-rollers Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly.\n\nThis \"trend following\" mindset has generated several waves of narrowly defined genres, leading to a perception of triteness, including teen pop (1998–2001), alternative rock (1993–1996), glam metal (1986–1991) and disco (1976–1978). Trend following can be counter-productive, since it has often led to a backlash. Towards the end of the life of each wave, record companies have found themselves faced with enormous losses, as consumers' tastes changed. For example, at the end of the disco boom in 1978, millions of records were returned by record retailers, causing a deep recession in the music business that lasted until 1982, when Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" finally brought the public back into record stores in large numbers.\n\nThe general move towards more conservative and business-minded signings from the 1980s onwards is seen to be symptomatic of an industry where the most powerful figures are no longer music fans or people with musical backgrounds, but business people. Traditionally A&R executives were composers, arrangers and producers – Atlantic Records's heads Jerry Wexler and Ahmet Ertegun were producers and composers respectively – but an A&R with musical ability and knowledge has become a rarity, with Ron Fair and Martin Kierszenbaum being notable recent exceptions. The composer and arranger Richard Niles has said,\n\nWhat you've got now is huge multinational companies where most of their A&R staff are businessmen. They’re people who look at music from the standpoint of marketing, not from the standpoint of music and talent. They will say, \"Go out and get me anything that's popular now.\"\n\nHip hop group Wu-Tang Clan referenced this stereotype of the business-minded A&R executive in their single \"Protect Ya Neck\", metaphorically likening them to \"mountain climbers\".\n\nAccording to Rhythm King Records and Lizard King Records founder Martin Heath, the A&R community in the UK is more integrated than it is in the US, being very London-centric and encompassing a relatively small number of people. \"If scouts are chasing a band, you’ll see the same thirty people in one room. You get a herd mentality in the UK, but also some very diverse signings as well,\" he said in an interview with HitQuarters. Heath believes that in the USA it is more typical for A&R to wait until a band is established – having attracted other offers or achieved a level of sales – before taking action, a technique which often works out as being more expensive.\n\nNew forms of digital distribution have changed the relationship between consumers and the music they choose. Gerd Leonhard and others argue that the wide selection of music on digital services has allowed music consumers to bypass the traditional role of A&R. In the wake of declining record sales, a large number of A&R staffers have been terminated. It is unclear whether A&R executives will shape the future of musical tastes as they have in the past.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "775927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=775927", "title": "Aymaran languages", "text": "Aymaran languages\n\nAymaran (also Jaqi, Aru, Jaqui, Aimara, Haki) is one of the two dominant language families of the central Andes, along with Quechuan.\n\nHardman (1978) proposed the name \"Jaqi\" for the family of languages (1978), Alfredo Torero \"Aru\" 'to speak', and Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino \"Aymaran\", with two branches, Southern (or Altiplano) Aymaran and Central Aymaran (Jaqaru and Kawki). \n\nQuechuan languages, especially those of the south, share a large amount of vocabulary with Aymara, and the languages have often been grouped together as Quechumaran. This proposal is controversial, however; the shared vocabulary may be better explained as intensive borrowing due to long-term contact.\n\nAymaran languages have only three phonemic vowels , which in most varieties of Aymara and Jaqaru are distinguished by length. Length is commonly transcribed using diaereses in Aymara and length diacritics in Jaqaru.\n\nThough Aymaran languages vary in terms of consonant inventories, they have several features in common. Aymara and Jaqaru both contain phonemic stops at labial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular points of articulation. Stops are distinguished by ejective and aspirated features. Both also contain alveolar, palatal, and velar fricatives and several central and lateral approximants.\n\nAymaran languages differ from Quechuan languages in that all verbal and nominal roots must end in a vowel, even in loanwords: Spanish \"habas\" (\"beans\") became Aymara \"hawasa\" and Jaqaru \"háwaša\". That feature is not found in other Andean languages. \n\nLike Quechuan languages, Ayamaran languages are highly agglutinative. However, they differ in that many agglutinative suffixes trigger vowel suppression in the preceding roots. An example is the loss of final vowel in the word \"apa\" (\"to take\"), when it becomes \"ap-su\" (\"to take out\"). \n\nAymaran consists of two languages:\n\nAymara has approximately 2.2 million speakers; 1.7 million in Bolivia, 350,000 in Peru, and the rest in Chile and Argentina. Jaqaru has approximately 725 speakers in central Peru, and Kawki had 9 surviving speakers as of 2005. Kawki is little documented though its relationship with Jaqaru is extremely close. Initially, they were considered by Martha Hardman (on very limited data at the time) to be different languages, but all subsequent fieldwork and research has contradicted that and demonstrated that they are mutually intelligible but divergent dialects of a single language.\n\n\n"}

In the 2010 Belize Census, 25.9% claimed Creole ethnicity and 44.6% claimed to speak Kriol. Possibly as many as 85,000 Creoles have migrated to the United States and may or may not still speak the language. This puts the number at over 150,000. Kriol is the lingua franca of Belize and is the first language of some Garifunas, Mestizos, Maya, and other ethnic groups. It is a second language for most others in the country.\n\nWhen the National Kriol Council began standardizing the orthography for Kriol, it decided to promote the spelling \"Kriol\" only for the language but to continue to use the spelling \"Creole\" to refer to the people in English.\n\nBelize Kriol is derived mainly from English. Its substrate languages are the Native American language Miskito, and the various West African and Bantu languages which were brought into the country by slaves. These include Akan, Efik, Ewe, Fula, Ga, Hausa, Igbo, Kikongo and Wolof.\n\nThere are numerous theories as to how creole languages form. A language emerged from the contact of English landowners and their West African slaves to ensure basic communication. The Baymen first began to settle in the area of Belize City in the 1650s. Decker (2005:3) proposes that the creole spoken in Belize previous to 1786 was probably more like Jamaican than the Belize Kriol of today. By the Convention of London in 1786 the British were supposed to cease all logwood cutting operations along the Caribbean coast of Central America, except for the Belize settlement. Many of the settlers from the Miskito Coast moved to Belize, bringing their Miskito Coast Creole with them. The immigrants outnumbered the Baymen five to one. The local Kriol speech shifted to become something more like the Miskito Coast Creole.\n\nToday, Belize Kriol is the first or second language of the majority of the country's inhabitants. Many of them speak standard English as well, and a rapid process of decreolization is going on. As such, a creole continuum exists and speakers are able to code-switch among various mesolect registers between the most basilect to the acrolect (\"Mid-Atlantic\") varieties. It should be noted that the acrolect, much like the basilect, is rarely heard.\n\nA 1987 travel guide in the \"Chicago Tribune\" newspaper reported that Belize Kriol is “a language that teases but just escapes the comprehension of a native speaker of English.”\n\nEnglish taught in the schools of Belize is based on British English. However, this is often influenced by the teachers' Kriol speech. The 1999 Ministry of Education: School Effectiveness Report (p. 84) notes “Creole is spoken as the first language in most homes.” Kriol is “di stiki stiki paat” that holds Belize together. Belizean people speak English, Kriol, and often Spanish, while learning the English system of writing and reading in schools. It is a slightly different system of communication from the standard forms.\n\nKriol shares phonological similarities with many Caribbean English Creoles as well as to English, its superstrate language. Pidgin languages have a general tendency to simplify the phonology of a language in order to ensure successful communication. Many Creoles keep this tendency after creolization. Kriol is no exception in this point.\n\nKriol uses a high number of nasalized vowels, palatalizes non-labial stops and prenasalizes voiced stops. Consonant clusters are reduced at the end of words and many sylables are reduced to only a consonant and vowel.\n\n1. Like most creole languages, Kriol has a tendency to an open syllabic structure, meaning there are many words ending in vowels. This feature is strengthened by its tendency to delete consonants at the end of words, especially when the preceding vowel is unstressed.\n\n2. Nasalization is phonemic in Kriol, caused by the deletion of final nasal consonants. The nasal feature is kept, even if the consonant has been dropped.\n\n3. Many Kriol speakers tend to palatalize the velar consonants and preceding . Sometimes they also palatalize alveolar consonants, such as , , and .\n\n4. Like all other creoles, Kriol also has a tendency to reduce consonant clusters no matter where they occur. Final consonant clusters are almost always reduced by dropping the second consonant. Initial and medial occurrences are reduced much less consistently.\n\n5. When occurs finally, it is always deleted. When it occurs in the middle of a word, it is often deleted leaving a residual vowel length.\n\n6. Although its superstrate language, English, makes extensive use of dental fricatives (), Belizean Kriol does not use them. It rather employs the alveolar stops and . However, due to the ongoing process of decreolization, some speakers include such dental fricatives in their speech.\n\n7. Unstressed initial vowels are often deleted in Kriol. Sometimes this can lead to a glottal stop instead.\n\n8. Vowels tend to be alternated for the ones used in English, f.i. or (\"boy\") becomes , (\"angry\") becomes and so on.\n\n9. Stress is evenly distributed across syllables, meaning that the prosody of Kriol is different than its lexifier. It is reserved mainly for content words an appears to only have High and Low tones \n\nKriol uses three voiced plosives () and three voiceless plosives(). The voiceless stops can also be aspirated. However, aspiration is not a constant feature, therefore the aspirated and non-aspirated forms are allophonic. The language employs three nasal consonants, (). It makes extensive use of fricatives and, both unvoiced () and voiced (. Its two liquids, and , are articulated alveo-palatally. The tongue is more lax here than in American English, its position is more similar to British English. Kriol's glides , , and are used extensively. Glottal stops occur rarely and inconsistently. Kriol makes use of eleven vowels; nine monophthongs, three diphthongs and schwa . The most frequently occurring diphthong, is used in all regional varieties. Both and can occur, but they are new additions and are viewed as a sign of decreolization. The same is perceived of four of the less productive monophthongs.\n\nUnlike most creoles, Kriol has a standardized orthography.\n\nConsonants: b, ch, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, sh, t, v, w, y, z, zh\nThe symbol choices for lengthened vowels come from ways those vowels are spelled in English, not the International Phonetic Alphabet.\nThere is a dictionary for Kriol with over 5000 entries, including sample sentences for each word.\n\nThe present tense verb is not marked overtly in Kriol. It also does not indicate number or person. As an unmarked verb, it can refer both to present and to perfective. The English past tense marker || at the end of the verbs indicates acrolectal speech. However, there is the possibility to mark past by putting the tense marker || before the verb. Overt marking is rare, however, if the sentence includes a semantic temporal marker, such as \"yestudeh\" (yesterday) or \"laas season\" (last season).\n\nThe future tense is indicated by employing the preverbal marker ' or '. Unlike the marking of past tense, this marking is not optional.\n\nThe preverbal marker ' expresses the progressive aspect in both past and present tense. However, if the past is not marked overtly (lexically or by using '), an unambiguous understanding is only possible in connection to context. ' is always mandatory. In past progressive, it is possible to achieve an unambiguous meaning by combining ' + \"\" + verb.\n\nProgressive action in the future can be expressed by using ' in conjunction with '. The correct combination here would be ' + ' + verb.\n\nKriol does not have a habitual aspect in its own right. Other creoles have a general tendency to merge the habitual with completive, the habitual with progressive, or the habitual with future. Kriol however, does not clearly merge it with anything. Thus, we can only assume that the habitual is expressed through context and not through morphological marking.\n\nThe completive aspect is expressed either without marking, that is, by context only, or by the use of a completive preverbal markers, such as ' or '.\n\nThe conditional mood is expressed through the conditional verbs ', ', and '. The short version, ', is employed only in the present tense; past tense requires the longer forms.\n\nThere is no overt lexical marking of active and passive in Kriol. It is only the emphasis of a sentence which can clarify the meaning, together with context. Emphasis can be strengthened by adding emphatic markers, or through repetition and redundancy.\n\nThere are four forms of \"be\" in Kriol: ', two uses of ', and the absence of a marker. The equative form ' is used as a copula (when the complement of the verb is either a noun or a noun phrase). ' is the locative form which is used when the verb's complement is a prepositional phrase. No overt marking is used when the complement is an adjective. \"\", finally, is used in the progressive aspect.\n\nThe verb \"to go\" is irregular in Kriol, especially when set in the future progressive. It does not use the progressive marker ' but is exchanged by the morpheme and '. In past tense, this is similar: instead of employing ', it uses the lexical item '.\n\nA verb which is used extensively in each conversation is \"\". It can be used like a modal in casual requests, in threats and intentional statements, and, of course, like the standard verb \"to make\".\n\nPlurals are usually formed in Kriol by inserting the obligatory postnomial marker '. Variations of this marker are ' and '. As decreolization is processing, the standard English plural ending ' occurs far more frequently. Sometimes, the \"\" is added to this form, f.i. in \"shoes de\" – shoes.\n\nThe absence of a plural marker occurs rarely.\n\nMany Spanish, Maya, and Garifuna words refer to popular produce and food items:\n\nThe construction of sentences in Kriol is very similar to that in English. It uses a Subject-Verb-Object order (SVO). All declarative and most interrogative sentences follow this pattern, the interrogatives with a changed emphasis. The construction of the phrases follows Standard English in many ways.\n\nLocatives are more frequently used in Kriol and much more productive than in Standard English. The general locative is expressed by the morpheme ' (\"at\" or \"to\"). It is possible to use ' or ' (\"on\") instead. This is an indication of either emphasis or decreolization. Another morpheme which is more specific than ' is ' (\"into\"). It is used in contexts where ' is not strong enough.\n\nTogether with the verb \"look\", however, \"\" is not used and denoted as incorrect. To express \"to look at\", it is wrong to say \"luk da\". The correct version would be \"luk pan\".\n\nIn a noun phrase, Kriol can employ a structure of both noun and pronoun to create emphasis. The ordering then is noun + pronoun + verb (f.i. \"mista filip hi noa di ansa\" – Mr Philip knows the answer).\n\nAdjectives are employed predicatively and attributively. They can be intensified either by the postposed adverb modifier ', by iteration, or by the use of the adverb modifier '. Iteration is here the usual way. Comparatives and superlatives are constructed according to morphosyntactic rules. A comparative is made by adding ' to the stem (\"taal\" – \"taala\" – tall). The morpheme ' is employed to form comparative statements, f.i. \"hî tɑlɑ dan shee\" – He is taller than she. Superlatives are created by adding ' to the stem. In all cases, the use of the definite article ' is obligatory. The copula is present if the superlative is used predicatively. An example could be: \"She dah di taales\" – She is the tallest.\n\nAdverbs are used much as they are in Standard English. In almost all cases, they differ from adjectives not in form but in function. There are, however a few exceptions, such as \"properli\" (properly), \"errli\" (early) or \"po:li\" (poorly). Adverbs can be intensified by reduplication.\n\nMost Kriol conjunctions are very similar to English and employed in the same way. The main difference is that Kriol allows double negation, so that some conjunctions are used differently. Some examples for Kriol conjunctions are: \"an\" (and), \"but\" (but), \"if\" (if), \"o:\" (or) etc.\n\nQuestions usually take the same form in Kriol as they do in Standard English: question word + subject + verb. The \"do-support\" does not occur here either. The rising intonation at the end of the sentence may increase even more if no question word is necessary. Thus, most declarative sentences can become interrogative with the right intonation. \"Which\" has various translations in Kriol. If the speaker means \"which\", he uses ', but he can also use ' for \"which one\".\n\nThe tense/aspect system of Kriol is fundamentally unlike that of English. There are no morphological marked past tense forms corresponding to English -ed -t. There are three preverbial particles: \"mi\" and \"did\" for the past, \"di\" as an \"aspect marker\", and a host of articles to indicate the future (\"(w)a(n)\", \"gwein\", \"gouɲ\"). These are not verbs, they are simply invariant particles which cannot stand alone like the English \"to be\". Their function differs also from the English.\n\nThe progressive category is marked by . Past habitual is marked by or . Present habitual aspect is unmarked but can be indicated by \"always\", \"usually\", etc. (i.e. is absent as a grammatical category). Mufwene (1984) and Gibson and Levy (1984) propose a past-only habitual category marked by as in (\"where we used to live is not as cold as here\") \n\nFor the present tense, an uninflected verb combining with an iterative adverb marks habitual meaning as in (\"Tom always knows when Katy tells/has told about him\").\n\n\nLike many other Caribbean Creoles and have a number of functions, including:\n\nThe pronominal system of Standard English has a four-way distinction of person, number, gender and case. Some varieties of Kriol do not have the gender or case distinction, though most do; but it does distinguish between the second person singular and plural (you).\n\n\nThe question words found in Kriol are:\n\n\n\nContrast of Copula Forms\n\nCopula = helping verb forms of “be”\n\nKriol: Ai da di teecha\n\nEnglish: I am the teacher.\n\nKriol: Yu da di teecha.\n\nEnglish: You are the teacher\n\nKriol: Ih da di teecha.\n\nEnglish: He/She is the teacher.\n\nKriol: Ah da-mi di teecha\n\nEnglish: I was the teacher\n\nKriol: Yu da-mi di teecha\n\nEnglish: You were the teacher.\n\nKriol: She/Ih da-mi di teecha.\n\nEnglish: She/He was the teacher.\n\n\n\n"}

In extreme cases, the idiom may imply that the contest is never-ending. The term is derived from the hunting behavior of domestic cats, which often appear to \"play\" with prey by releasing it after capture. This behavior may arise from an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.\n\nIn colloquial usage, it has often been generalized to mean the advantage constantly shifts between the contestants, leading to an impasse or \"de facto\" stalemate. In classical game theory, cat and mouse classifies as a \"copycat\" archetype whereby there exists no equilibrium, and most importantly, no endgame, its two protagonists, Dot and Ditto, running amok in their game space to infinity, with no endpoint to their game anywhere in site attributable to a defective reward system; conflicting incentives. Theoretical active reading on \"cat and mouse,\" or \"Dot and Ditto\" is ominous in its implication; multiple protagonists, each armed a passive strategy, can remain theoretically locked in total perpetual war indefinitely, wholly unable to rise to a plateau sufficient to intellectualize their plight.\n\n"}

It is sometimes a sexual fantasy of women or men, depicting an exhibitionist or physique worship scenario. CFNM situations can arise in situations where a male disrobes as part of a male striptease, a medical examination, as a figure model for art students, or is forced to remove clothing as a punitive measure. In pornography or erotic writing, CFNM depicts a power exchange where the more traditionally dominant male is objectified, debased, or humiliated by a more traditionally submissive female. As a result, CFNM fiction frequently includes the clothed female taking on the role of a dominatrix over the nude male.\n\nThe opposite of CFNM is clothed male, naked female (CMNF).\n\nIn classical antiquity, the portrayal of nude male form in art (including the exposure of genitals) was considered to be more acceptable than that of the naked female form. By the renaissance, this view had reversed. For example, in Titian's \"treatment of Perseus and Andromeda\" in the mid-1550s, it is Andromeda who is nude—save for the barest wisp of fabric—while Perseus is clothed in armour.\n\nDepictions of nudity were acceptable to the 19th-century French salon culture if the setting was clearly \"classical\", depicting characters in a culture where nudity was commonplace, as in \"Combat de coqs\" (1847) by Jean-Léon Gérôme.\n\nFeminist authors Christina Hoff Sommers and Naomi Wolf have written that women's sexual liberation has led many women to a role reversal, whereby they view men as sex objects, in a manner similar to what they criticize in men's treatment of women.\n\n"}
{"id": "19963916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19963916", "title": "Conviction politics", "text": "Conviction politics\n\nConviction politics is the practice of campaigning based on a politician's own fundamental values or ideas rather than attempting to represent an existing consensus or simply take positions that are popular in polls.\n\nOn the right, the term has been adopted by politicians like Margaret Thatcher, who declared, \"I am not a consensus politician. I am a conviction politician\" in 1979, a few months before her election as prime minister.\n\nThere are a number of arguments for conviction politics. One is that it is more honest; conviction politicians simply say what they believe rather than shading their opinions to be more palatable to their audience. Another is that by voicing strong opinions, they push public debate forward and promote a genuine discussion of political issues. Even if the candidates lose, they will have promoted their particular political ideas and persuaded some voters of their value.\n\nThere are also more instrumental reasons. By arguing forcefully for their positions during the campaign, politicians are more able to pursue the goals once in office. Also, proponents argue that conviction politicians are more likely to win. When he was a candidate, Tom Perriello stated that, \"More often, the deepest connection with another person comes from when I disagree with them and admit it, because at least they know I will tell the truth. While some strategists focus on positioning candidates on issue after issue, I believe most voters focus more on whether the candidate integrity and character on the whole, demonstrated by the conviction to take a stand.\"\n\nUS politician Senator Paul Wellstone, for example, frequently heard voters tell him, \"I don't always agree with you, but I like it that I know where you stand.\" He found that when he announced his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, an unpopular position at the time, he jumped to a five-point lead in the polls.\n\nIn the United States, 87% of voters in one poll said they think politicians are \"pretty much willing to say whatever it takes in order to get themselves elected.\" By saying what they believe and ignoring the polls, conviction politicians distinguish themselves from other politicians.\n\nThatcher, like her contemporary Ronald Reagan in the United States, argued that her leadership should be a time for big, bold changes, grounded in the central principles of her ideology. \"It was not a set of policies cobbled together from minute to minute, begged, borrowed or stolen from other people,\" she said while describing her government. \"It was successful because it was based on clear, firmly-held principles.\" A devout Methodist, she further defended the principles as being grounded in the Christian Bible: \"I believe that by taking together these key elements from the Old and New Testaments, we gain a view of the universe, a proper attitude to work and principles to shape economic and social life. We are told we must work and use our talents to create wealth.\"\n\nHer thinking on the subject was influenced by Keith Joseph, sometimes considered the \"intellectual leader\" of modern British conservatism and the man Thatcher called \"my closest political friend.\" Joseph had developed an intellectual critique of the reigning postwar and Keynesian consensus and criticized the \"consensus politics\" that continued to promote it.\n\nIn 2007, the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown announced he too was \"a conviction politician\" after private talks with Thatcher in a 10 Downing Street visit. He was criticised for the gaffe as being inappropriate for a Labour Party politician to identify with the 81-year-old former Conservative prime minister.\n\nIn the US, Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone was a major proponent of conviction politics from the left, promoting peace, environmental and labor protections, and health care. After Wellstone's death in 2002, his longtime aide and campaign manager, Jeff Blodgett, founded Wellstone Action, which promotes conviction politics through education and training.\n\nVirginia Representative Tom Perriello explicitly ran his successful campaign based on \"conviction politics.\"\n\nThe conviction politics practiced by George W. Bush has been called a \"hard ideology\" with \"religious and chauvinistic underpinnings\" and \"contributed to the call by Muslim fundamentalists to a broader jihad\" that has \"redefined the war on terror and alienated Arab and Muslim public opinion.\"\n\nCritics of Thatcher's conviction politics say it \"burst apart the old consensus\" and has \"fostered dissensus.\"\n\nSome critics have even said that conviction politics, especially in the US, are \"theological politics.\"\n\n"}

Cross-cutting cleavages were originally suggested as a mechanism for political stability, as no group can align all its members along a uniform cleavage-based platform, but rather has to appeal to members of the group that are spread throughout the groups created by other cleavages. \nThe most in-depth discussion of this process is that by Seymour Martin Lipset in his 1960 book \"Political Man\". \n\nStein Rokkan wrote a classic essay on crosscutting cleavages in Norway. \n\nCross-cutting theory was applied to such topics as social order, political violence, voting behaviour, political organization and democratic stability, for example Truman's \"The Governmental Process\", Dahl's \"A Preface to Democratic Theory\", among others. Around the same time, several scholars (including Lipset himself) suggested ways to measure the concept, the best-known being Rae and Taylor's in their 1970 book \"The Analysis of Political Cleavages\". Due to data limitations, these theories were generally left untested for a couple of decades.\n\nDiana Mutz revived the concept in the early 2000s, looking at political participation and democratic theory using survey data in the US and other Western European democracies.\n\nSeveral scholars have written on how cross-cutting cleavages relates to ethnic voting, civil war, ethnic censuses (Lieberman and Singh 2012) and economic growth (Selway 2011). \n\nSelway (2011) suggested a new measure for crosscutting cleavages and published a crossnational dataset on crosscutting cleavages among several dimensions (ethnicity, class, geography and religion).\n\nDesmet, Ortuño-Ortín and Wacziarg (2017), in the \"American Economic Review\", derive and discuss several measures of cross-cuttingness and compute them using data on ethnic identity and cultural values. \n\nSociologists have used the term, especially in the sub-field of Macro Sociology.

{"id": "706816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=706816", "title": "Egyptian Arabic", "text": "Egyptian Arabic\n\nEgyptian Arabic, locally known as the Egyptian colloquial language or Masri, meaning simply \"Egyptian\", is spoken by most contemporary Egyptians.\n\nEgyptian is a North African dialect of the Arabic language which is a Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family. It originated in the Nile Delta in Lower Egypt around the capital Cairo. Egyptian Arabic evolved from the Quranic Arabic which was brought to Egypt during the seventh-century AD Muslim conquest that aimed to spread the Islamic faith among the Egyptians. Egyptian Arabic is very highly influenced by the Egyptian Coptic language which was the native language of the Egyptians prior to the Islamic conquest, and later it had small influences by other languages such as French, Italian, Greek, Turkish and English. The 94 million Egyptians speak a continuum of dialects, among which Cairene is the most prominent. It is also understood across most of the Arabic-speaking countries due to the predominance of Egyptian influence on the region as well as Egyptian media including Egyptian cinema which has had a big influence in the MENA region for more than a century along with the Egyptian music industry, making it the most widely spoken and one of the most widely studied varieties of Arabic.\n\nWhile it is essentially a spoken language, it is encountered in written form in novels, plays, and poems (vernacular literature), as well as in comics, advertising, some newspapers, and transcriptions of popular songs.\nIn most other written media and in television news reporting, Literary Arabic is used. Literary Arabic is a standardized language based on the language of the Quran, that is, Classical Arabic. The Egyptian vernacular is almost universally written in the Arabic alphabet for local consumption, although it is commonly transcribed into Latin letters or in the International Phonetic Alphabet in linguistics text and textbooks aimed at teaching non-native learners. Also, it is written in ASCII Latin alphabet mainly online and in SMSs.\n\nEgyptians call the dialect the Egyptian colloquial language\n( ), Egyptian dialect\nabbreviated: ‎ \"Egyptian\"), or the Modern Egyptian language\n\nThe term Egyptian Arabic is usually used synonymously with Cairene Arabic, which is technically a dialect of Egyptian Arabic. The country's native name, \"Maṣr\", is often used locally to refer to Cairo itself. Like the role played by Parisian French, Cairene Arabic is by far the most dominant dialect in all areas of national life.\n\nThe total number of Egyptian Arabic users in all countries is over 64.5 million, 62.3 million of which are native speakers in Egypt, including several regional dialects. In addition, there are immigrant Egyptian communities in the Middle East, Europe, North America, Latin America, Australia and South East Asia. Among the spoken varieties of Arabic, standard Egyptian Arabic (based on the dialect of the Egyptian capital) is the only one to have become a lingua franca in other parts of the Arabic-speaking world for two main reasons: the proliferation and popularity of Egyptian films and other media in the region since the early 20th century as well as the great number of Egyptian teachers and professors who were instrumental in setting up the education systems of various countries in the Arabian Peninsula and also taught there and in other countries such as Algeria and Libya; although this is changing as Damascus Arabic is taking its rule in the media. Also, many Lebanese artists choose to sing in Egyptian and Lebanese. Standard Egyptian Arabic when used in documents, broadcast media, prepared speeches, and sometimes in liturgical purpose, is Cairene Arabic with loanwords from Modern Standard Arabic origin or code-switching between Cairene Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic.\n\nThe Egyptians slowly adopted the Arabic as a written language following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in the seventh century. Until then, they had spoken either Koine Greek or Egyptian in its Coptic form. A period of Coptic-Arabic bilingualism in Lower Egypt lasted for more than three centuries. The period would last much longer in the south. Arabic may have been already familiar to Egyptians through pre-Islamic trade with Bedouins in the Sinai Peninsula and the easternmost part of the Nile Delta. Egyptian Arabic seems to have begun taking shape in Fustat, the first Islamic capital of Egypt, now part of Cairo.\n\nOne of the earliest linguistic sketches of Egyptian Arabic is a 16th-century document entitled \"\" (, \"The Removal of the Burden from the Language of the People of Egypt\") by Yusuf al-Maghribi (). It contains key information on early Egyptian Arabic and the language situation in Egypt in the Middle Ages. The main purpose of the document was to show that while the Egyptians' vernacular contained many critical \"errors\" vis-à-vis Classical Arabic, according to al-Maghribi, it was also related to Arabic in other respects. With the ongoing Islamization and Arabization of the country, Egyptian Arabic slowly supplanted spoken Coptic. Local chroniclers mention the continued use of Coptic as a spoken language until the 17th century by peasant women in Upper Egypt. Coptic is still the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.\n\nEgyptian Arabic has no official status and is not officially recognized as a language. Modern Standard Arabic, a modernized form of Classical Arabic (also called Qur'anic Arabic), is the official language of Egypt (see diglossia). Interest in the local vernacular began in the 1800s, as the Egyptian national movement for self-determination was taking shape. For many decades to follow, questions about the reform and the modernization of Arabic were hotly debated in Egyptian intellectual circles. Proposals ranged from developing neologisms to replace archaic terminology in Modern Standard Arabic to the simplification of syntactical and morphological rules and the introduction of colloquialisms to even complete \"Egyptianization\" (\"tamṣīr\") by abandoning the so-called Modern Standard Arabic in favor of Masri or Egyptian Arabic.\n\nProponents of language reform in Egypt included Qasim Amin, who also wrote the first Egyptian feminist treatise, former President of the Egyptian University, Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, and noted intellectual Salama Moussa. They adopted a modernist, secular approach and disagreed with the assumption that Arabic was an immutable language because of its association with the Qur'an. The first modern Egyptian novel in which the dialogue was written in the vernacular was Muhammad Husayn Haykal's \"Zaynab\" in 1913. It was inly in 1966 that Mustafa Musharafa's \"Kantara Who Disbelieved\" was released, the first novel to be written entirely in Egyptian Arabic. Other notable novelists, such as Ihsan Abdel Quddous and Yusuf Idris, and poets, such as Salah Jahin, Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi and Ahmed Fouad Negm, helped solidify vernacular literature as a distinct literary genre.\n\nAmongst certain groups within Egypt's elite, Egyptian Arabic enjoyed a brief period of rich literary output. That dwindled with the rise of Egyptian Arab nationalism, which had gained wide popularity in Egypt by the final years of the Muhammad Ali dynasty, as demonstrated vividly by Egypt's involvement in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War under King Farouk of Egypt. The Egyptian revolution of 1952, led by Mohammed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, further enhanced the significance of Arab nationalism, making it a central element of Egyptian state policy. The importance of Modern Standard Arabic was reemphasised in the public sphere by the revolutionary government, and efforts to accord any formal language status to the Egyptian vernacular were ignored. Egyptian Arabic was identified as a mere dialect, one that was not spoken even in all of Egypt, as almost all of Upper Egypt speaks Sa'idi Arabic. Though the revolutionary government heavily sponsored the use of the Egyptian vernacular in films, plays, television programmes, and music, the prerevolutionary use of Modern Standard Arabic in official publications was retained.\n\nLinguistic commentators have noted the multi-faceted approach of the Egyptian revolutionaries towards the Arabic language. Whereas Egypt's first president, Mohammed Naguib exhibited a preference for using Modern Standard Arabic in his public speeches, his successor, Gamal Abdel Nasser was renowned for using the vernacular and for punctuating his speeches with traditional Egyptian words and expressions. Conversely, Modern Standard Arabic was the norm for state news outlets, including newspapers, magazines, television, and radio. That was especially true of Egypt's national broadcasting company, the Arab Radio and Television Union, which was established with the intent of providing content for the entire Arab world, not merely Egypt, hence the need to broadcast in the standard, rather than the vernacular, language. The Voice of the Arabs radio station, in particular, had an audience from across the region, and the use of anything other than Modern Standard Arabic was viewed as eminently incongruous.\n\nAs the status of Egyptian Arabic as opposed to Classical Arabic can have such political and religious implications in Egypt, the question of whether Egyptian Arabic should be considered a \"dialect\" or \"language\" can be a source of debate. In sociolinguistics, Egyptian Arabic can be seen as one of many distinct varieties that, despite arguably being languages on \"abstand\" grounds, are united by a common \"dachsprache\" in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).\n\nDuring the early 1900s many portions of the Bible were published in Egyptian Arabic. These were published by the Nile Mission Press. By 1932 the whole New Testament and some books of the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Psalms and The Prophets) had been published in Egyptian Arabic in Arabic script.\n\nSa‘īdi Arabic is a separate variety from Egyptian Arabic in Ethnologue.com and ISO 639-3 and in other sources, and the two varieties have limited mutual intelligibility. It carries little prestige nationally but continues to be widely spoken, with 19,000,000 speakers, including in the north by rural migrants who have adapted partially to Egyptian Arabic. For example, the Sa‘īdi genitive exponent is usually replaced with Egyptian \"\", but the realization of as is retained. Second-and third-generation migrants are monolingual in Egyptian Arabic but maintain cultural and familial ties to the south.\n\nThe traditional division between Upper and Lower Egypt and their respective differences go back to ancient times. Egyptians today commonly call the people of the north ' () and those of the south ' (). The differences throughout Egypt, however, are more wide-ranging and do not neatly correspond to the simple division. The language shifts from the eastern to the western parts of the Nile Delta, and the varieties spoken from Giza to Minya are further grouped into a Middle Egypt cluster. Despite the differences, there are features distinguishing all the Egyptian Arabic varieties of the Nile Valley from any other varieties of Arabic. Such features include reduction of long vowels in open and unstressed syllables, the postposition of demonstratives and interrogatives, the modal meaning of the imperfect and the integration of the participle.\n\nThe Western Egyptian Bedawi Arabic variety of the western desert differs from all other Arabic varieties in Egypt in that it linguistically is part of Maghrebi Arabic. The same was formerly true of the Egyptian form of Judaeo-Arabic. Northwest Arabian Arabic is also distinct from Egyptian Arabic.\n\nEgyptian Arabic has a phonology that differs slightly from that of other varieties of Arabic and has its own inventory of consonants and vowels.\n\nIn contrast to CA and MSA, nouns are not inflected for case and lack nunation (with the exception of certain fixed phrases in the accusative case, such as , \"thank you\"). As all nouns take their pausal forms, singular words and broken plurals simply lose their case endings. In sound plurals and dual forms, where, in MSA, difference in case is present even in pausal forms, the genitive/accusative form is the one preserved. Fixed expressions in the construct state beginning in \"abu\", often geographic names, retain their \"-u\" in all cases.\n\nA common set of nouns referring to colors, as well as a number of nouns referring to physical defects of various sorts (\"ʔaṣlaʕ\" \"bald\"; \"ʔaṭṛaʃ\" \"deaf\"; \"ʔaxṛas\" \"dumb\"), take a special inflectional pattern, as shown in the table. Note that only a small number of common colors inflect this way: \"ʔaḥmaṛ\" \"red\"; \"ʔazraʔ\" \"blue\"; \"ʔaxḍaṛ\" \"green\"; \"ʔaṣfaṛ\" \"yellow\"; \"ʔabyaḍ\" \"white\"; \"ʔiswid\" \"black\"; \"ʔasmaṛ\" \"brown-skinned, brunette\"; \"ʔaʃʔaṛ\" \"blond(e)\". The remaining colors are invariable, and mostly so-called \"nisba\" adjectives derived from colored objects: \"bunni\" \"brown\" (< \"bunn\" \"coffee powder\"); \"ṛamaadi\" \"gray\" (< \"ṛamaad\" \"ashes\"); \"banafsigi\" \"purple\" (< \"banafsig\" \"violet\"); \"burtuʔaani\" \"orange\" (< \"burtuʔaan\" \"oranges\"); \"zibiibi\" \"maroon\" (< \"zibiib\" \"raisins\"); etc., or of foreign origin: \"beeع\" \"beige\" from the French; \"bamba\" \"pink\" from Turkish \"pembe\".\n\nEgyptian Arabic object pronouns are clitics, in that they attach to the end of a noun, verb or preposition, with the result forming a single phonological word rather than separate words. Clitics can be attached to the following types of words:\n\nWith verbs, indirect object clitic pronouns can be formed using the preposition \"li-\" plus a clitic. Both direct and indirect object clitic pronouns can be attached to a single verb: \"agíib\" \"I bring\", \"agíb-hu\" \"I bring it\", \"agib-húu-lik\" \"I bring it to you\", \"m-agib-hu-lkíi-ʃ\" \"I do not bring it to you\".\n\nVerbs in Arabic are based on a stem made up of three or four consonants. The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes and/or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person and number, in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as causative, intensive, passive or reflexive.\n\nEach particular lexical verb is specified by two stems, one used for the past tense and one used for non-past tenses along with as subjunctive and imperative moods. To the former stem, suffixes are added to mark the verb for person, number and gender, while to the latter stem, a combination of prefixes and suffixes are added. (Very approximately, the prefixes specify the person and the suffixes indicate number and gender.) The third person masculine singular past tense form serves as the \"dictionary form\" used to identify a verb, similar to the infinitive in English. (Arabic has no infinitive.) For example, the verb meaning \"write\" is often specified as \"kátab\", which actually means \"he wrote\". In the paradigms below, a verb will be specified as \"kátab/yíktib\" (where \"kátab\" means \"he wrote\" and \"yíktib\" means \"he writes\"), indicating the past stem (\"katab-\") and non-past stem (\"-ktib-\", obtained by removing the prefix \"yi-\").\n\nThe verb classes in Arabic are formed along two axes. One axis (described as \"form I\", \"form II\", etc.) is used to specify grammatical concepts such as causative, intensive, passive or reflexive, and involves varying the stem form. For example, from the root K-T-B \"write\" is derived form I kátab/yíktib \"write\", form II káttib/yikáttib \"cause to write\", form III ká:tib/yiká:tib \"correspond\", etc. The other axis is determined by the particular consonants making up the root. For example, defective verbs have a W or Y as the last root consonant, which is often reflected in paradigms with an extra final vowel in the stem (e.g. ráma/yírmi \"throw\" from R-M-Y); meanwhile, hollow verbs have a W or Y as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs appear to have only two consonants (e.g. gá:b/yigí:b \"bring\" from G-Y-B).\n\nStrong verbs are those that have no \"weakness\" (e.g. W or Y) in the root consonants.\nEach verb has a given vowel pattern for Past (a or i) and Present (a or i or u). Combinations of each exist.\n\nForm I verbs have a given vowel pattern for past (a or i) and present (a, i or u). Combinations of each exist:\n\nExample: kátab/yíktib \"write\"\n\nNote that, in general, the present indicative is formed from the subjunctive by the addition of \"bi-\" (\"bi-a-\" is elided to \"ba-\"). Similarly, the future is formed from the subjunctive by the addition of \"ḥa-\" (\"ḥa-a-\" is elided to \"ḥa-\"). The \"i\" in \"bi-\" or in the following prefix will be deleted according to the regular rules of vowel syncope:\n\nExample: kátab/yíktib \"write\": non-finite forms\n\nExample: fíhim/yífham \"understand\"\n\nBoldfaced forms fíhm-it and fíhm-u differ from the corresponding forms of katab (kátab-it and kátab-u due to vowel syncope). Note also the syncope in ána fhím-t \"I understood\".\n\nExample: dárris/yidárris \"teach\"\n\nBoldfaced forms indicate the primary differences from the corresponding forms of katab:\n\nExample: sá:fir/yisá:fir \"travel\"\n\nThe primary differences from the corresponding forms of darris (shown in boldface) are:\n\nDefective verbs have a W or Y as the last root consonant.\n\nExample: ráma/yírmi \"throw away\" (i.e. trash, etc.)\n\nThe primary differences from the corresponding forms of katab (shown in boldface) are:\n\nExample: nísi/yínsa \"forget\"\n\nThis verb type is quite similar to the defective verb type ráma/yírmi. The primary differences are:\n\nNote that some other verbs have different stem variations, e.g. míʃi/yímʃi \"walk\" (with \"i\" in both stems) and báʔa/yíbʔa \"become, remain\" (with \"a\" in both stems). The verb láʔa/yilá:ʔi \"find\" is unusual in having a mixture of a form I past and form III present (note also the variations líʔi/yílʔa and láʔa/yílʔa).\n\nVerbs other than form I have consistent stem vowels. All such verbs have \"a\" in the past (hence form stems with \"-é:-\", not \"-í:-\"). Forms V, VI, X and IIq have \"a\" in the present (indicated by boldface below); others have \"i\"; forms VII, VIIt, and VIII have \"i\" in both vowels of the stem (indicated by italics below); form IX verbs, including \"defective\" verbs, behave as regular doubled verbs:\n\nHollow have a W or Y as the middle root consonant. Note that for some forms (e.g. form II and form III), hollow verbs are conjugated as strong verbs (e.g. form II \"ʕáyyin/yiʕáyyin\" \"appoint\" from ʕ-Y-N, form III \"gá:wib/yigá:wib\" \"answer\" from G-W-B).\n\nExample: gá:b/yigí:b \"bring\"\n\nThis verb works much like dárris/yidárris \"teach\". Like all verbs whose stem begins with a single consonant, the prefixes differ in the following way from those of regular and defective form I verbs:\n\nIn addition, the past tense has two stems: gíb- before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and gá:b- elsewhere (third person).\n\nExample: ʃá:f/yiʃú:f \"see\"\n\nThis verb class is identical to verbs such as gá:b/yigí:b except in having stem vowel \"u\" in place of \"i\".\n\nDoubled verbs have the same consonant as middle and last root consonant, e.g. ḥább/yiḥíbb \"love\" from Ḥ-B-B.\n\nExample: ḥább/yiḥíbb \"love\"\n\nThis verb works much like gá:b/yigí:b \"bring\". Like that class, it has two stems in the past, which are ḥabbé:- before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and ḥább- elsewhere (third person). Note that \"é:-\" was borrowed from the defective verbs; the Classical Arabic equivalent form would be *ḥabáb-, e.g. *ḥabáb-t.\n\nOther verbs have \"u\" or \"a\" in the present stem: baṣṣ/yibúṣṣ \"to look\", ṣaḥḥ/yiṣáḥḥ \"be right, be proper\".\n\nAs for the other forms:\n\nAssimilated verbs have W or Y as the first root consonant. Most of these verbs have been regularized in Egyptian Arabic, e.g. wázan/yíwzin \"to weigh\" or wíṣíl/yíwṣal \"to arrive\". Only a couple of irregular verbs remain, e.g. wíʔif/yúʔaf \"stop\" and wíʔiʕ/yúʔaʕ \"fall\" (see below).\n\n\"Doubly weak\" verbs have more than one \"weakness\", typically a W or Y as both the second and third consonants. This term is in fact a misnomer, as such verbs actually behave as normal defective verbs (e.g. káwa/yíkwi \"iron (clothes)\" from K-W-Y, ʔáwwa/yiʔáwwi \"strengthen\" from ʔ-W-Y, dá:wa/yidá:wi \"treat, cure\" from D-W-Y).\n\nThe irregular verbs are as follows:\n\n\nExample: gé/yí:gi \"come\": non-finite forms\n\nIn this section all verb classes and their corresponding stems are listed, excluding the small number of irregular verbs described above. Verb roots are indicated schematically using capital letters to stand for consonants in the root:\nHence, the root F-M-L stands for all three-consonant roots, and F-S-T-L stands for all four-consonant roots. (Traditional Arabic grammar uses F-ʕ-L and F-ʕ-L-L, respectively, but the system used here appears in a number of grammars of spoken Arabic dialects and is probably less confusing for English speakers, since the forms are easier to pronounce than those involving \"ʕ\".)\n\nThe following table lists the prefixes and suffixes to be added to mark tense, person, number and gender, and the stem form to which they are added. The forms involving a vowel-initial suffix, and corresponding stem or , are highlighted in silver. The forms involving a consonant-initial suffix, and corresponding stem , are highlighted in gold. The forms involving a no suffix, and corresponding stem or , are unhighlighted.\n\nThe following table lists the verb classes along with the form of the past and non-past stems, active and passive participles, and verbal noun, in addition to an example verb for each class.\n\nNotes:\n\nOne characteristic of Egyptian syntax which it shares with other North African varieties as well as some southern Levantine dialect areas is in the two-part negative verbal circumfix \n\n\nThe structure can end in a consonant or in a vowel , varying according to the individual or region. The fuller ending is considered rural, and nowadays Cairene speakers usually use the shorter . However, was more common in the past, as attested in old films.\n\nThe negative circumfix often surrounds the entire verbal composite including direct and indirect object pronouns:\nHowever, verbs in the future tense typically instead use the prefix /miʃ/:\nInterrogative sentences can be formed by adding the negation clitic \"(miʃ)\" before the verb:\nAddition of the circumfix can cause complex changes to the verbal cluster, due to the application of the rules of vowel syncope, shortening, lengthening, insertion and elision described above:\n\nIn addition, certain other morphological changes occur:\n\nIn contrast with Classical Arabic, but much like the other varieties of Arabic, Egyptian Arabic prefers subject–verb–object (SVO) word order; CA and to a lesser extent MSA prefer verb–subject–object (VSO). For example, in MSA \"Adel read the book\" would be ' whereas EA would say ' .\n\nAlso in common with other Arabic varieties is the loss of unique agreement in the dual form: while the dual remains productive to some degree in nouns, dual nouns are analyzed as plural for the purpose of agreement with verbs, demonstratives, and adjectives. Thus \"These two Syrian professors are walking to the university\" in MSA (in an SVO sentence for ease of comparison) would be \" \" , which becomes in EA \"\" \",\" .\n\nUnlike most other forms of Arabic, however, Egyptian prefers final placement of question words in interrogative sentences. This is a feature characteristic of the Coptic substratum of Egyptian Arabic.\n\nEgyptian Arabic appears to have retained a significant Coptic substratum in its lexicon, phonology, and syntax. Coptic is the latest stage of the indigenous Egyptian language spoken until the mid-17th century when it was finally completely supplanted among Egyptian Muslims and a majority of Copts by the Egyptian Arabic. Some features that Egyptian Arabic shares with the original ancient Egyptian language include certain prefix and suffix verbal conjugations, certain emphatic and glottalized consonants, as well as a large number of biliteral and triliteral lexical correspondences.\n\nTwo syntactic features that are particular to Egyptian Arabic inherited from Coptic are:\n\n\nAlso since Coptic, like other North African languages, lacked interdental consonants it could possibly have influenced the manifestation of their occurrences in Classical Arabic as their dental counterparts and the emphatic dental respectively. (see consonants)\n\nEgyptian Arabic is used in most social situations, with Modern Standard and Classical Arabic generally being used only in writing and in highly-religious and/or formal situations. However, within Egyptian Arabic, there is a wide range of variation. El-Said Badawi identifies three distinct levels of Egyptian Arabic based chiefly on the quantity of non-Arabic lexical items in the vocabulary: \"ʿĀmmiyyat al-Musaqqafīn\" (Cultured Colloquial or Formal Spoken Arabic), \"ʿĀmmiyyat al-Mutanawwirīn\" (Enlightened or Literate Colloquial), and \"ʿĀmmiyyat al-'Ummiyīn\" (Illiterate Colloquial). Cultured Colloquial/Formal Spoken Arabic is characteristic of the educated classes and is the language of discussion of high-level subjects, but it is still Egyptian Arabic; it is characterized by use of technical terms imported from foreign languages and MSA and closer attention to the pronunciation of certain letters (particularly \"qāf\"). It is relatively standardized and, being closer to the standard, it is understood fairly well across the Arab world. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Illiterate Colloquial, common to rural areas and to working-class neighborhoods in the cities, has an almost-exclusively Arabic vocabulary; the few loanwords generally are very old borrowings (e.g. ', \"shrimp,\" from Italian \"gamberi\", \"shrimp\" (pl.)) or refer to technological items that find no or poor equivalents in Arabic (e.g. ' , television). Enlightened Colloquial (\"ʿĀmmiyyat al-Mutanawwirīn\") is the language of those who have had some schooling and are relatively affluent; loanwords tend to refer to items of popular culture, consumer products and fashions. It is also understood widely in the Arab world, as it is the \"lingua franca\" of Egyptian cinema and television.\n\nIn contrast to MSA and most other varieties of Arabic, Egyptian Arabic has a form of the T-V distinction. In the singular, \"enta\"/\"enti\" is acceptable in most situations, but to address clear social superiors (e.g. older persons, superiors at work, certain government officials), the form \"\", meaning \"Your Grace\" is preferred (compare Spanish \"usted\").\n\nThis use of \"\" is linked to the system of honorifics in daily Egyptian speech. The honorific taken by a given person is determined by their relationship to the speaker and their occupation.\n\nOther honorifics also exist.\n\nIn usage, honorifics are used in the second and third person.\n\nEgyptian Arabic varies regionally across its \"sprachraum\", with certain characteristics being noted as typical of the speech of certain regions.\n\nThe dialect of Alexandria (West Delta]) is noted for certain shibboleths separating its speech from that of Cairo (South Delta). The ones that are most frequently noted in popular discourse are the use of the word \"falafel\" as opposed to \"ṭa`meyya\" for the fava-bean fritters common across the country and the pronunciation of the word for the Egyptian pound as , rather than the Cairene (closer to the pronunciation of the origin of the term, the British guinea). The speech of the older Alexandrian families is also noted for use of the first-person plural even when they speak in the singular.\n\nPort Said's dialect (East Delta) is noted for a \"heavier\", more guttural sound, compared to other regions of the country.\n\nEgyptian Arabic has been a subject of study by scholars and laypersons in the past and the present for many reasons, including personal interest, egyptomania, business, news reporting and diplomatic and political interactions. Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA) is now a field of study in both graduate and undergraduate levels in many higher education institutions and universities in the world. When added to academic instruction, Arabic\n-language schools and university programs provide Egyptian Arabic courses in a classroom fashion, and others facilitate classes for online study.\n\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nEgyptian/Masri (Arabic script; spelling not standardised):\n\nFranco/Arabic Chat Alphabet (has no strict standard):\n\nel e3lan el 3alami le 72u2 el ensan, el band el awalani\n<br>\nel bani2admin kollohom mawlodin 7orrin we metsawyin fel karama wel 7o2u2.

She is sometimes considered a proletarian writer.\n\nElsie Johansson was born in Vendel as the fifth child of a \"statare\". Her father would later find work as a lumberjack and construction worker. The Johansson family lived under sparse circumstances in a simple cabin, which would later serve as inspiration for similar housings found in Johansson's novels. Owing to the persuasion of a female teacher, Johansson was allowed to attend \"realskola\" in Uppsala, from which she graduated in 1948; upon graduation, she found employment as a postal worker. She married at the age of 18, and had a child at 19.\n\nJohansson would work at the post office for another 30 years, before making her literary debut with the poetry collection \"Brorsan hade en vevgrammofon\", at the age of 48. Her first novel, \"Kvinnan som mötte en hund\", followed in 1984. In addition to her poems and novels intended for adult readers, she has written a number of books for children and adolescents.\n\nHer breakthrough as a writer came with the \"Nancy\" trilogy (\"Glasfåglarna\", \"Mosippan\" and \"Nancy\"), which earned her several awards, amongst others the Aniara Prize. Johansson also received the Litteris et Artibus award.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9739", "title": "Emoticon", "text": "Emoticon\n\nAn emoticon (, , rarely pronounced ), short for \"emotion icon\", also known simply as an emote, is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters—usually punctuation marks, numbers, and letters—to express a person's feelings or mood, or as a time-saving method. The first ASCII emoticons, codice_1 and codice_2, were written by Scott Fahlman in 1982, but emoticons actually originated on the PLATO IV computer system in 1972.\n\nIn Western countries, emoticons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text. Users from Japan popularized a kind of emoticon called kaomoji (; lit. 顔(kao)=face, 文字(moji)=character(s)) that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986.\n\nAs SMS and the internet became widespread in the late 1990s, emoticons became increasingly popular and were commonly used on text messages, internet forums and e-mails. Emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology, and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text punctuation. They offer another range of \"tone\" and feeling through texting that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text-based cyber communication.\n\nThe word is a portmanteau word of the English words \"emotion\" and \"icon\". In web forums, instant messengers and online games, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which came to be called \"emoticons\" as well. Emoticons for a smiley face codice_1 and sad face codice_2 appear in the first documented use in digital form. Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in double-byte languages, giving rise to especially complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of kaomoji.\n\nThe use of emoticons can be traced back to the 17th century, drawn by a Slovak notary to indicate his satisfaction with the state of his town's municipal financial records in 1635, but they were commonly used in casual and humorous writing. Digital forms of emoticons on the Internet were included in a proposal by Scott Fahlman of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in a message on September 19, 1982.\n\nThe \"National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide\" in April 1857 documented the use of the number 73 in Morse code to express \"love and kisses\" (later reduced to the more formal \"best regards\"). \"Dodge's Manual\" in 1908 documented the reintroduction of \"love and kisses\" as the number 88. Gajadhar and Green comment that both Morse code abbreviations are more succinct than modern abbreviations such as LOL.\nA \"New York Times\" transcript of an Abraham Lincoln speech written in 1862 contains \"codice_5\"; there is some debate whether it is a typo, a legitimate punctuation construct, or an emoticon.\nFour vertical typographical emoticons were published in 1881 by the U.S. satirical magazine \"Puck\", with the stated intention that the publication's letterpress department thus intended to \"lay out [...] all the cartoonists that ever walked\".\n\nIn 1912, Ambrose Bierce proposed \"an improvement in punctuation – the snigger point, or note of cachinnation: it is written thus ‿ and presents a smiling mouth. It is to be appended, with the full stop, to every jocular or ironical sentence\".\n\nIn a 1936 \"Harvard Lampoon\" article, Alan Gregg proposed (-) for smile, (--) for laugh (more teeth showing), (#) for frown, (*) for wink, and (#) for \"intense interest, attention, and incredulity\". Note that the symbols are correctly oriented and are not sideways.\n\nEmoticons had already come into use in sci-fi fandom in the 1940s, although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities.\n\nThe September 1962 issue of \"MAD\" magazine included an article titled \"Typewri-toons\". The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to \"Royal Portable\", was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger bust than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from a snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n's interrupted by a lowercase h \"raising its hand\". Two additional \"Typewri-toons\" articles subsequently appeared in \"Mad\", in 1965 and 1987.\n\nIn 1963, the \"smiley face\", a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth was created by freelance artist Harvey Ball. It was realized on order of a large insurance company as part of a campaign to bolster the morale of its employees and soon became a big hit. This smiley presumably inspired many later emoticons; the most basic graphic emoticon that depicts this is, in fact, a small yellow smiley face.\n\nIn a \"New York Times\" interview in April 1969, Alden Whitman asked writer Vladimir Nabokov: \"How do you rank yourself among writers (living) and of the immediate past?\" Nabokov answered: \"I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile – some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question.\"\n\nIn 1971, a French journalist, Franklin Loufrani, created a smiley logo to mark good news in the French newspaper \"France Soir\". Loufrani was the first person to trademark the symbol, in 1972. Later, in 1996, Loufrani established The Smiley Company with his son, Nicolas Loufrani. Nicolas developed hundreds of different emoticons, including 3D versions. His designs were registered at the United States Copyright Office in 1997 and appeared online as .gif files in 1998. These were the first graphical representations of the originally text-based emoticon. He published his icons as well as emoticons created by others, along with their ASCII versions, in an online Smiley Dictionary in the early 2000s. This dictionary included over 3,000 different Smileys and was published as a book called \"Dico Smileys\" in 2002. The Smiley Company has trademarked its version of the smiley face in over 100 countries. In 1997, The Smiley Company filed a trademark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In 2001, Walmart opposed the registration, citing a likelihood of confusion between the Loufrani smiley and a smiley face Walmart had been using since 1990. The USPTO eventually sided with Walmart and rejected The Smiley Company's application, due to the widespread use of smiley face designs. Seeking to prevent Walmart from using any smiley face design, Nicolas Loufrani next sued Walmart in federal court in 2009, while claiming that his smiley face was \"readily distinguishable\" from Walmart's. The case was closed in 2011 when the two parties agreed to settle out of court. The terms of the settlement were undisclosed, but Walmart continued to use its smiley design intermittently and returned to using it in a major marketing role in 2016.\n\nStarting circa 1972, on the PLATO system, emoticons and other decorative graphics were produced as ASCII art, particularly with overprinting: typing a character, backing up, then typing another character. For example, WOBTAX and VICTORY both produced convincing smiley faces (where the overprinted characters produced the solid background, and pixels untouched by any of the characters produced the actual design). This developed into a sophisticated set, particularly in combination with superscript and subscript.\n\nScott Fahlman was the first documented person to use the emoticons codice_1 and codice_2, with a specific suggestion that they be used to express emotion. The text of his original proposal, posted to the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general board on September 19, 1982 (11:44), was thought to have been lost, but was recovered 20 years later by Jeff Baird from old backup tapes.\n\nOther notable computer scientists who participated in this thread include David Touretzky, Guy Steele, and Jaime Carbonell.\n\nWithin a few months, it had spread to the ARPANET and Usenet. Many variations on the theme were immediately suggested by Scott and others.\n\nUsually, emoticons in Western style have the eyes on the left, followed by nose and the mouth. The two character version codice_8 which omits the nose is also very popular.\n\nThe most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny ambigrams), with or without a hyphen (nose).\nThere are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example, codice_9 equals sad and codice_10 equals very sad. Weeping can be written as codice_11. A blush can be expressed as codice_12. Others include wink codice_13, a grin codice_14, smug codice_15, and tongue out codice_16, such as when blowing a raspberry. An often used combination is also codice_17 for a heart, and codice_18 for a broken heart. codice_19 is also sometimes used to depict shock.\n\nA broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; codice_20 and the addition of further \"D\" letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e.g. codice_21. There are hundreds of other variations including codice_22 for anger, or codice_23 for an evil grin, which can be, again, used in reverse, for an unhappy angry face, in the shape of codice_24. codice_25 for vampire teeth, codice_26 for grimace, and codice_27 can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a second meaning in the sentence preceding it.\n\nAs computers offer increasing built-in support for non-Western writing systems, it has become possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons. The 'shrug' emoticon, codice_28, uses the glyph ツ from the Japanese katakana writing system.\n\nAn equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as codice_29, without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an \"o\" as in codice_30 . In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes, but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon codice_1 or codice_32. One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an emoticon may be related to the user's age. Similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance, codice_33, codice_34, and codice_35 can all be used interchangeably, sometimes for subtly different effect or, in some cases, one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another. It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as codice_36 instead of codice_37.\n\nSome variants are also more common in certain countries due to keyboard layouts. For example, the smiley codice_29 may occur in Scandinavia, where the keys for codice_39 and codice_37 are placed right beside each other. However, the codice_8 variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia, making the codice_29 version a rarity. Diacritical marks are sometimes used. The letters codice_43 and codice_44 can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of codice_19 (meaning that one is surprised) and codice_14 (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.\n\nSome emoticons may be read right to left instead, and in fact can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round; for example codice_47 which refers to being shocked or anxious, opposite to the large grin of codice_14.\n\nUsers from Japan popularized a style of emoticons (, \"kaomoji, lit.\" \"face characters\") that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET, an early Japanese online service, in 1986. Similar-looking emoticons were used on the Byte Information Exchange (BIX) around the same time.\n\nThese emoticons are usually found in a format similar to codice_49. The asterisks indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an underscore, the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face.\n\nDifferent emotions can be expressed by changing the character representing the eyes: for example, \"T\" can be used to express crying or sadness: codice_50. codice_51 may also be used to mean \"unimpressed\". The emphasis on the eyes in this style is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. codice_52. Looks of stress are represented by the likes of codice_53, while codice_54 is a generic emoticon for nervousness, the semicolon representing an anxiety-induced sweat drop (discussed further below). codice_55 can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing. Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, \"cuter\" mouth, or to represent a nose, e.g. codice_56. Alternatively, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. codice_57.\n\nParentheses are sometimes replaced with braces or square brackets, e.g. codice_58 or codice_59. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. codice_52,codice_61, codice_62, codice_63, codice_64, or codice_65. A quotation mark codice_66, apostrophe codice_67, or semicolon codice_68 can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in manga and anime.\n\nMicrosoft IME 2000 (Japanese) or later supports the input of emoticons like the above by enabling the Microsoft IME Spoken Language/Emotion Dictionary. In IME 2007, this support was moved to the Emoticons dictionary. Such dictionaries allow users to call up emoticons by typing words that represent them.\n\nCommunication software allowing the use of Shift JIS encoded Japanese characters rather than just ASCII allowed for the development of new kaomoji using the extended character set, such as codice_69 or codice_70.\n\nModern communication software generally utilizes Unicode, which allows for the incorporation of characters from other languages (e.g. from the Cyrillic alphabet), and a variety of symbols into the kaomoji, as in codice_71 or codice_72.\n\nFurther variations can be produced using Unicode combining characters, as in codice_73 or codice_74.\n\nEnglish-language anime forums adopted those Japanese-style emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on Western keyboards. Because of this, they are often called \"anime style\" emoticons in English. They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and non-anime-related discussion forums. Emoticons such as codice_75, codice_76, codice_77, codice_78, codice_79, or codice_80 which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs < or >) also are often referred to as \"\" in reference to their likeness to Nintendo's video game character Kirby. The parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an intensifier for the emoticon in question, e.g. codice_81 for very happy. The emoticon uses the Eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the Western \"middle-finger flick-off\" using a \"t\" as the arm, hand, and finger. Another apparently Western invention is the use of emoticons like codice_82 or codice_83 to indicate vampires or other mythical beasts with fangs.\n\nExposure to both Western and Japanese style emoticons or kaomoji through blogs, instant messaging, and forums featuring a blend of Western and Japanese pop culture has given rise to many emoticons that have an upright viewing format. The parentheses are often dropped, and these emoticons typically only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as codice_84, codice_85, codice_86, codice_87, codice_88, codice_51, codice_90, and codice_91 are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime- or manga-styled sweat drop, for example codice_92, codice_93, codice_94, codice_95, and codice_96. The equals sign can also be used for closed, anime-looking eyes, for example codice_97, codice_98, codice_99, codice_100, and codice_101.\n\nIn Brazil, sometimes combining characters (accents) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, as in codice_102, codice_103, codice_104, codice_105, or codice_106.\n\nUsers of the Japanese discussion board 2channel, in particular, have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from various languages, such as Kannada, as in codice_107 (for a look of disapproval, disbelief, or confusion). These were quickly picked up by 4chan and spread to other Western sites soon after. Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like Monā.\n\nIn South Korea, emoticons use Korean Hangul letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean jamo (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters. Consonant jamos codice_108, codice_109 or codice_110 as the mouth/nose component and codice_111, codice_112 or codice_113 for the eyes. For example: codice_114, codice_115, codice_116 and codice_117. Faces such as codice_118, codice_119, codice_120 and codice_121, using quotation marks codice_66 and apostrophes codice_67 are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as ㅜ,ㅠ depict a crying face. Example: codice_124, codice_125 and codice_126 (same function as T in western style). Sometimes ㅡ (not an em-dash \"—\" but a vowel jamo), a comma or an underscore is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in codice_127, codice_128, codice_129, codice_130, codice_131 and codice_132. Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons mean sweating (embarrassed). If they are used with ㅡ or – they depict a bad feeling. Examples: codice_133, codice_134, codice_135, codice_136 and codice_137. However, codice_138 means smile (almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age). Others include: codice_139, codice_140, codice_141, codice_142.\n\nThe character 囧 (U+56E7), which means \"bright\", is also used in the Chinese computing community for a frowning face. It is also combined with posture emoticon Orz, such as 囧rz. The character existed in Oracle bone script, but its use as emoticon was documented as early as January 20, 2005.\n\nOther ideographic variants for 囧 include 崮 (king 囧), 莔 (queen 囧), 商 (囧 with hat), 囧興 (turtle), 卣 (Bomberman).\n\nThe character 槑 (U+69D1), which sounds like the word for \"plum\" (梅 (U+FA44)), is used to represent double of 呆 (dull), or further magnitude of dullness. In Chinese, normally full characters (as opposed to the stylistic use of 槑) may be duplicated to express emphasis.\n\nOrz (other forms include: ) is an emoticon representing a kneeling or bowing person (the Japanese version of which is called \"dogeza\") with the \"o\" being the head, the \"r\" being the arms and part of the body, and the \"z\" being part of the body and the legs. This stick figure can represent failure and despair. It is also commonly used for representing a great admiration (sometimes with an overtone of sarcasm) for someone else's view or action.\n\nIt was first used in late 2002 at the forum on Techside, a Japanese personal website. At the \"Techside FAQ Forum\" (TECHSIDE教えて君BBS(教えてBBS) ), a poster asked about a cable cover, typing to show a cable and its cover. Others commented that it looked like a kneeling person, and the symbol became popular. These comments were soon deleted as they were considered off-topic. By 2005, Orz spawned a subculture: blogs have been devoted to the emoticon, and URL shortening services have been named after it. In Taiwan, Orz is associated with the phrase \"nice guy\"that is, the concept of males being rejected for a date by girls they are pursuing with a phrase like \"You are a nice guy.\"\n\nOrz should not be confused with m(_ _)m, which means \"Thank you\" or an apology.\n\nA portmanteau of \"emotion\" and \"sound\", an emotisound is a brief sound transmitted and played back during the viewing of a message, typically an IM message or e-mail message. The sound is intended to communicate an emotional subtext. Many instant messaging clients automatically trigger sound effects in response to specific emoticons.\n\nSome services, such as MuzIcons, combine emoticons and music player in an Adobe Flash-based widget.\n\nIn 2004, the Trillian chat application introduced a feature called \"emotiblips\", which allows Trillian users to stream files to their instant message recipients \"as the voice and video equivalent of an emoticon\".\n\nIn 2007, MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment promoted the \"emoticlip\" as a form of viral marketing for the second season of the show \"The Hills\". The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube, which the advertisers hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to emoticons. The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley & Montgomery advertising firm, which hopes they would be widely adopted as \"greeting cards that just happen to be selling something\".\n\nIn 2008, an emotion-sequence animation tool, called FunIcons was created. The Adobe Flash and Java-based application allows users to create a short animation. Users can then email or save their own animations to use them on similar social utility applications.\n\nDuring the first half of the 2010s, there have been different forms of small audiovisual pieces to be sent through instant messaging systems to express one's emotion. These videos lack an established name, and there are several ways to designate them: \"emoticlips\" (named above), \"emotivideos\" or more recently \"emoticon videos\". These are tiny videos which can be easily transferred from one mobile phone or other device to another. Current video compression codecs such as H.264 allow these pieces of video to be light in terms of file size and very portable. The popular computer and mobile app Skype uses these in a separate keyboard or by typing the code of the \"emoticon videos\" between parentheses.\n\nIn 2000, Despair, Inc. obtained a U.S. trademark registration for the \"frowny\" emoticon codice_2 when used on \"greeting cards, posters and art prints\". In 2001, they issued a satirical press release, announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny; the joke backfired and the company received a storm of protest when its mock release was posted on technology news website Slashdot.\n\nA number of patent applications have been filed on inventions that assist in communicating with emoticons. A few of these have been issued as US patents. , for example, discloses a method developed in 2001 to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop-down menu. The stated advantage over the prior art was that the user saved on the number of keystrokes though this may not address the obviousness criteria.\n\nThe emoticon codice_1 was also filed in 2006 and registered in 2008 as a European Community Trademark (CTM). In Finland, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in 2012 that the emoticon cannot be trademarked, thus repealing a 2006 administrative decision trademarking the emoticons codice_1, codice_29, codice_147, codice_8 and codice_9.\n\nIn 2005, a Russian court rejected a legal claim against Siemens by a man who claimed to hold a trademark on the codice_150 emoticon.\n\nIn 2008, Russian entrepreneur Oleg Teterin claimed to have been granted the trademark on the codice_150 emoticon. A license would not \"cost that muchtens of thousands of dollars\" for companies, but would be free of charge for individuals.\n\nSome smiley faces were present in Unicode since 1.1.0, including a white frowning face, a white smiling face, and a black smiling face. (\"Black\" refers to a glyph which is filled, \"white\" refers to a glyph which is unfilled).\n\nThe Emoticons block was introduced in Unicode Standard version 6.0 (published in October 2010) and extended by 7.0. It covers Unicode range from U+1F600 to U+1F64F fully.\nAfter that block had been filled, Unicode 8.0 (2015), 9.0 (2016) and 10.0 (2017) added additional emoticons in the range from U+1F910 to U+1F9FF. Currently, U+1F90CU+1F90F, U+1F93F, U+1F94DU+1F94F, U+1F96CU+1F97F, U+1F998U+1F9CF (excluding U+1F9C0 which contains the 🧀 emoji) and 1F9E71F9FF do not contain any emoticons since Unicode 10.0 (2017).\n\nFor historic and compatibility reasons, some other heads and figures, which mostly represent different aspects like genders, activities and professions instead of emotions, are also found in Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs (especially U+1F466U+1F487) and Transport and Map Symbols. Body parts, mostly hands, are also encoded in the Dingbat and Miscellaneous Symbols blocks.\n\n"}
{"id": "48682799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48682799", "title": "Energy forecasting", "text": "Energy forecasting\n\nEnergy forecasting is a broad term that refers to \"forecasting in the energy industry\". It includes but is not limited to forecasting demand (load) and price of electricity, fossil fuels (natural gas, oil, coal) and renewable energy sources (RES; hydro, wind, solar). The term is used to describe both point and probabilistic (i.e., interval and density).\n\nWhen electricity sectors were regulated, utility monopolies used short-term load forecasts to ensure the reliability of supply and long-term demand forecasts as the basis for planning and investing in new capacity. However, since the early 1990s, the process of deregulation and the introduction of competitive electricity markets have been reshaping the landscape of the traditionally monopolistic and government-controlled power sectors. In many countries worldwide, electricity is now traded under market rules using spot and derivative contracts. At the corporate level, electricity load and price forecasts have become a fundamental input to energy companies’ decision making mechanisms. The costs of over- or undercontracting and then selling or buying power in the balancing market are typically so high that they can lead to huge financial losses and bankruptcy in the extreme case. In this respect electric utilities are the most vulnerable, since they generally cannot pass their costs on to the retail customers.\n\nWhile there have been a variety of empirical studies on point forecasts (i.e., the \"best guess\" or expected value of the spot price), probabilistic - i.e., interval and density - forecasts have not been investigated extensively to date. However, this is changing and nowadays both researchers and practitioners are focusing on the latter. While the Global Energy Forecasting Competition in 2012 was on point forecasting of electric load and wind power, the 2014 edition aimed at probabilistic forecasting of electric load, wind power, solar power and electricity prices.\n\nExtreme volatility of wholesale electricity prices, which can be up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of any other commodity or financial asset, has forced market participants to hedge not only against volume risk but also against price movements. A generator, utility company or large industrial consumer who is able to forecast the volatile wholesale prices with a reasonable level of accuracy can adjust its bidding strategy and its own production or consumption schedule in order to reduce the risk or maximize the profits in day-ahead trading. Yet, since load and price forecasts are being used by many departments of an energy company, it is very hard to quantify the benefits of improving them. A rough estimate of savings from a 1% reduction in the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for a utility with 1GW peak load is:\n\nThe most popular (in terms of the number of research papers and techniques developed) subfields of energy forecasting include:\n\nIt is customary to talk about short-, medium- and long-term forecasting, but there is no consensus in the literature as to what the thresholds should actually be:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9856239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9856239", "title": "Feldpost", "text": "Feldpost\n\nFeldpost is the German military mail service. Its history dates back to the 18th century in the Kingdom of Prussia during the Seven Years' War and War of the Bavarian Succession and has existed ever since in different forms and shapes.\nDuring 1937-39, the German Wehrmacht had a military mailing service that provided free postal services within Germany. On September 3, 1939, the first changes to the service occurred. Postcards and letters up to 250 g including newspapers could be mail free of charge by the German para-military and military organizations. Later in 1939, packages weighing up to 1000 g were included at the nominal rate of 20 Reichspfennig fee. All German military branches had its own organic postal administration in charge of receiving and delivering mail. For \"Feldpost\" offices closest to the combat zone a mobile facility usually processed mail for all military branches.\n\nIn 1940 further changes were introduced followed through the rapid conquest of Europe. Eventually a series of postal agreements were set up between Germany and the occupied countries providing an extended usage of Feldpost service. Countries such as the Netherlands had close to 50,000 pro-Nazi volunteers that during the course of the war used the Feldpost service. Eventually these postal agreements were settled between Germany and other countries, including neutral countries such as Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and Turkey, which had volunteers within the German forces.\nTo preserve the secrecy of troop movements, each battalion was assigned a five digit code number called Feldpost number (FPN). By the end of 1939, letter prefixes \"L\" and \"M\" were attached in front of each FPN to units belonging to the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine. A breakdown by military units was added by attaching letter prefixes \"A\" through \"E\" at the end of each FPN. The letter A generally signified headquarters company, the others stood for line companies. \n\nThe sequence of an FPN does not necessarily mean that the location of the units were at the same area. The postal cover/postcard itself was usually stamped with a military \"Feldpost Cancellation\" and \"Official Military Unit Seal\". Feldpost numbers were sometimes reassigned to other units, particularly when a unit ceased to exist. Normally Feldpost mail could not be dispatched nor received by civil post offices. If a soldier wanted to send mail through a civil post office, full postage was collected.\n\n\n"}

The Hrazdan region was one of the power houses of USSR Defense Industry. In July and December 1987, as a member of Armenian Communist Party Central Committee, during Central Committee plenary sessions he publicly accused the leaders of Armenian Communist party of cronyism and corruption, and of sabotaging the policy of reforms aimed at modernization of society, also known as “Perestroika”. Kotanjian’s views on reforms were supported by USSR liberal-democratic circles and reformist faction of the USSR Communist party.\n\nIn 1988 based on his orders Hrazdan region law enforcement bodies launched clandestine activities to register the testimonies of Armenian refugees from Azerbaijani city Sumgait. These testimonies are proofs of Genocidal actions implemented against Armenian population of Sumgait. Today those “White notes” are located in the archives of Armenia’s General Prosecutor office and are the only professionally systemized evidences on Sumgait massacres. In 1989 on Kotanjian’s initiative, as a result of negotiations with Azerbaijani relevant authorities, an unprecedented swap of 3000 Azerbaijanis living in Hrazdan region with Armenians from Baku was implemented. The financial and property interests of all people involved in the program were guaranteed.\n\nIn 1989-1990, as an inspector of the Armenia’s Communist party first secretary, he elaborated official policy papers on Karabakh conflict for the leadership of the Central Committee of the Armenian Communist Party.\n\nHayk Kotanjian, as a member of the national headquarters dealing with evacuation of population from earthquake zone, coordinated the program of redeployment of 30.000 people from earthquake zone, mainly women and children, to the different resorts of Soviet Union with full provision of food, medicine and education process.\n\nDuring April – December 1991 Hayk Kotanjian was Minister of foreign affairs of the Nagorno Karabakh Government in Exile in Moscow with Marius Yuzbashyan (Minister of National Security) and Yuri Barseghov (Minister of Justice). The government was working during the period of the Soviet sanctions against Armenia as a result of latter rejection to participate in the March 1991 referendum on the Soviet Union based the new Federative Union treaty organized by Mikhail Gorbachov.\n\nThe government in exile supported the authorities of Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh to make sober assessments of threats eliminating from the collapse of the USSR. The utmost significance for both Armenia and Karabakh was the assessment on perspectives of the coup d’état, organized in Moscow in August 1991. The consultations delivered by the government in exile were instrumental in the process of elaboration of key decisions on the proclamation of Nagorno Karabakh Republic on September 2, 1991, organizing the September 21, 1991 independence Referendum in Armenia and December 10, 1991 Independence Referendum in Nagorno Karabakh. The formation of government in exile by USSR MP Zory Balayan and the acting Armenian Interior Minister Ashot Manucharyan was an extraordinary step, implemented in the extreme unfavorable conditions for the establishment of Armenia and Artsakh sovereignty.\n\nKotanjian is the author of several monographs and numerous articles on crisis management, ethnic conflict, security, defense and strategic studies, and cyberpsychology.\n\n°«Ethnic Politics of Conflict.

It derives from the Greek for \"priestly writing\" (), as at that time, hieratic was used only for religious texts and literature, as had been the case for the previous eight and a half centuries.\n\n\"Hieratic\" can also be an adjective meaning \"[o]f or associated with sacred persons or offices; sacerdotal.\"\n\nHieratic developed as a cursive form of hieroglyphic script in the Naqada III period, roughly 3200–3000 BCE. Although handwritten printed hieroglyphs continued to be used in some formal situations, such as manuscripts of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, noncursive hieroglyphic script became largely restricted to monumental inscriptions. \n\nHieratic was used into the Hellenistic period. Around 660 BCE, the even more-cursive Demotic script arose in northern Egypt and replaced hieratic and the southern shorthand known as abnormal hieratic for most mundane writing, such as personal letters and mercantile documents. Hieratic continued to be used by the priestly class for religious texts and literature into the third century BCE.\n\nThrough most of its long history, hieratic was used for writing administrative documents, accounts, legal texts, and letters, as well as mathematical, medical, literary, and religious texts. During the Græco-Roman period, when Demotic (and later Greek) had become the chief administrative script, hieratic was limited primarily to religious texts. In general, hieratic was much more important than hieroglyphs throughout Egypt's history, being the script used in daily life. It was also the writing system first taught to students, knowledge of hieroglyphs being limited to a small minority who were given additional training. In fact, it is often possible to detect errors in hieroglyphic texts that came about due to a misunderstanding of an original hieratic text.\n\nMost often, hieratic script was written in ink with a reed brush on papyrus, wood, stone or pottery ostraca. Thousands of limestone ostraca have been found at the site of Deir al-Madinah, revealing an intimate picture of the lives of common Egyptian workmen. Besides papyrus, stone, ceramic shards, and wood, there are hieratic texts on leather rolls, though few have survived. There are also hieratic texts written on cloth, especially on linen used in mummification. There are some hieratic texts inscribed on stone, a variety known as lapidary hieratic; these are particularly common on stelae from the 22nd Dynasty.\n\nDuring the late 6th Dynasty, hieratic was sometimes incised into mud tablets with a stylus, similar to cuneiform. About five hundred of these tablets have been discovered in the governor's palace at Ayn Asil (Balat), and a single example was discovered from the site of Ayn al-Gazzarin, both in the Dakhla Oasis. At the time the tablets were made, Dakhla was located far from centers of papyrus production. These tablets record inventories, name lists, accounts, and approximately fifty letters. Of the letters, many are internal letters that were circulated within the palace and the local settlement, but others were sent from other villages in the oasis to the governor.\n\nHieratic script, unlike inscriptional and manuscript hieroglyphs, reads from right to left. Initially, hieratic could be written in either columns or horizontal lines, but after the 12th Dynasty (specifically during the reign of Amenemhat III), horizontal writing became the standard.\n\nHieratic is noted for its cursive nature and use of ligatures for a number of characters. Hieratic script also uses a much more standardized orthography than hieroglyphs; texts written in the latter often had to take into account extra-textual concerns, such as decorative uses and religious concerns that were not present in, say, a tax receipt. There are also some signs that are unique to hieratic, though Egyptologists have invented equivalent hieroglyphic forms for hieroglyphic transcriptions and typesetting. Several hieratic characters have diacritical additions so that similar signs could easily be distinguished. \n\nHieratic is often present in any given period in two forms, a highly ligatured, cursive script used for administrative documents, and a broad uncial bookhand used for literary, scientific, and religious texts. These two forms can often be significantly different from one another. Letters, in particular, used very cursive forms for quick writing, often with large numbers of abbreviations for formulaic phrases, similar to shorthand.\n\nA highly cursive form of hieratic known as \"Abnormal Hieratic\" was used in the Theban area from the second half of the 20th dynasty until the beginning of the 26th Dynasty. It derives from the script of Upper Egyptian administrative documents and was used primarily for legal texts, land leases, letters, and other texts. This type of writing was superseded by Demotic—a Lower Egyptian scribal tradition—during the 26th Dynasty, when Demotic was established as a standard administrative script throughout a re-unified Egypt.\n\nHieratic has had influence on a number of other writing systems. The most obvious is that on Demotic, its direct descendant. Related to this are the Demotic signs of the Meroitic script and the borrowed Demotic characters used in the Coptic alphabet and Old Nubian.\n\nOutside of the Nile Valley, many of the signs used in the Byblos syllabary were apparently borrowed from Old Kingdom hieratic signs. It is also known that early Hebrew used hieratic numerals.\n\nThe Unicode standard considers hieratic characters' font variants of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, and the two scripts have been unified. Hieroglyphs themselves were added to the Unicode Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2. To date, there is no known Unicode font with hieratic.\n\n\n"}

It is the mainstream form of Southern Min.\n\nIt is closely related to Teochew, though it has limited mutual intelligibility with it, whereas it is more distantly related to other variants such as Hainanese and Leizhou dialect.\n\nHokkien historically served as the lingua franca amongst overseas Chinese communities of all dialects and subgroups in Southeast Asia, and remains today as the most spoken variety of Chinese in the region, including in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and some parts of Indochina (particularly Thailand, Laos and Cambodia).\n\nThe Betawi Malay language, spoken by some five million people in and around the Indonesian capital Jakarta, includes numerous Hokkien loanwords due to the significant influence of the Chinese Indonesian diaspora, most of whom are of Hokkien ancestry and origin.\n\nChinese speakers of the Quanzhang variety of Southern Min refer to the mainstream Southern Min language as\n\n\nIn parts of Southeast Asia and in the English-speaking communities, the term \"Hokkien\" () is etymologically derived from the Southern Min pronunciation for Fujian (), the province from which the language hails. In Southeast Asia and the English press, \"Hokkien\" is used in common parlance to refer to the Southern Min dialects of southern Fujian, and does not include reference to dialects of other Sinitic branches also present in Fujian such as Eastern Min or Hakka. In Chinese linguistics, these dialects are known by their classification under the Quanzhang division () of Min Nan, which comes from the first characters of the two main Hokkien urban centers of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou.\n\nHokkien originated in the southern area of Fujian province, an important center for trade and migration, and has since become one of the most common Chinese varieties overseas. The major pole of Hokkien varieties outside of Fujian is Taiwan, where, during the 200 years of Qing dynasty rule, thousands of immigrants from Fujian arrived yearly. The Taiwanese dialect mostly has origins with the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou variants, but since then, the Amoy dialect, also known as the Xiamen dialect, is becoming the modern prestige standard for the language in Mainland China. Both \"Amoy\" and \"Xiamen\" come from the Chinese name of the city (); the former is from Zhangzhou Hokkien, whereas the later comes from Mandarin.\n\nThere are many Minnan (Hokkien) speakers among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia as well as in the United States (Hoklo Americans). Many ethnic Han Chinese emigrants to the region were Hoklo from southern Fujian, and brought the language to what is now Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia (the former Dutch East Indies) and present day Malaysia and Singapore (formerly Malaya and the British Straits Settlements). Many of the Minnan dialects of this region are highly similar to Xiamen dialect (Amoy) and Taiwanese Hokkien with the exception of foreign loanwords. Hokkien is reportedly the native language of up to 80% of the Chinese people in the Philippines, among which is known locally as Lan-nang or Lán-lâng-oē (\"Our people’s language\"). Hokkien speakers form the largest group of overseas Chinese in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines.\n\nSouthern Fujian is home to three principal Minnan Proper (Hokkien) dialects: Chinchew, Amoy, Chiangchew, originating from the cities of Quanzhou, Xiamen and Zhangzhou(respectively).\n\nTraditionally speaking, Quanzhou dialect spoken in Quanzhou is the Traditional Standard Minnan, it is the dialect that is used in Liyuan Opera (梨园戏) and Nanying music (南音). Being the Traditional Standard Minnan, Quanzhou dialect is considered to have the purest accent and the most conservative Minnan dialect.\n\nIn the late 18th to the early 19th century, Xiamen (Amoy) became the principal city of southern Fujian. Xiamen (Amoy) dialect is adopted as the Modern Standard Minnan. It is a hybrid of the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. It has played an influential role in history, especially in the relations of Western nations with China, and was one of the most frequently learnt dialect of Quanzhang variety by Westerners during the second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century.\n\nSame as Amoy dialect, the Modern Standard form of Quanzhang accent spoken around the city of Tainan in Taiwan is a hybrid of the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. All Quanzhang dialects spoken throughout the whole of Taiwan are collectively known as Taiwanese Hokkien or just Taiwanese. Used by a majority of the population, it bears much importance from a socio-political perspective, forming the second (and perhaps today most significant) major pole of the language due to the popularity of Taiwanese-language media.\n\nThe varieties of Hokkien in Southeast Asia originate from these dialects.\n\nThe Singaporeans, Southern Malaysians and people in Indonesia's Riau and surrounding islands variant is from the Quanzhou area. They speak a distinct form of Quanzhou Hokkien called Southern Peninsular Malaysian Hokkien (SPMH).\n\nAmong ethnic Chinese inhabitants of Penang, and other states in Northern Malaysia and Medan, with other areas in North Sumatra, Indonesia, a distinct form of Zhangzhou Hokkien has developed. In Penang, it is called Penang Hokkien while across the Malacca Strait in Medan, an almost identical variant is known as Medan Hokkien.\n\nThe Philippines variant is mostly from Quanzhou or Amoy (Xiamen), as most of their ancestors are from the aforementioned area.\n\nVariants of Hokkien dialects can be traced to two sources of origin: Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. Both Amoy and most Taiwanese are based on a mixture of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects, while the rest of the Hokkien dialects spoken in South East Asia are either derived from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, or based on a mixture of both dialects.\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms period of ancient China, there was constant warfare occurring in the Central Plain of China. Northerners began to enter into Fujian region, causing the region to incorporate parts of northern Chinese dialects. However, the massive migration of northern Han Chinese into Fujian region mainly occurred after the Disaster of Yongjia. The Jìn court fled from the north to the south, causing large numbers of northern Han Chinese to move into Fujian region. They brought the Old Chinese spoken in the Central Plain of China from the prehistoric era to the 3rd century into Fujian. This then gradually evolved into the Quanzhou dialect.\n\nIn 677 (during the reign of Emperor Gaozong), Chen Zheng, together with his son Chen Yuanguang, led a military expedition to suppress a rebellion of the She people. In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi, led a military expedition force to suppress the Huang Chao rebellion.\nThese two waves of migration from the north brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into the Fujian region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect.\n\nAmoy dialect is the main dialect spoken in the Chinese city of Xiamen and its surrounding regions of Tong'an and Xiang'an, both of which are now included in the greater Xiamen area. This dialect developed in the late Ming dynasty when Xiamen was increasingly taking over Quanzhou's position as the main port of trade in southeastern China. Quanzhou traders began traveling southwards to Xiamen to carry on their businesses while Zhangzhou peasants began traveling northwards to Xiamen in search of job opportunities. A need for a common language arose. The Quanzhou and Zhangzhou varieties are similar in many ways (as can be seen from the common place of Henan Luoyang where they originated), but due to differences in accents, communication can be a problem. Quanzhou businessmen considered their speech to be the prestige accent and considered Zhangzhou's to be a village dialect. Over the centuries, dialect leveling occurred and the two speeches mixed to produce the Amoy dialect.\n\nSeveral playscripts survive from the late 16th century, written in a mixture of Quanzhou and Chaozhou dialects. The most important is the \"Romance of the Litchi Mirror\", with extant manuscripts dating from 1566 and 1581.\n\nIn the early 17th century, Spanish missionaries in the Philippines produced materials documenting the Hokkien varieties spoken by the Chinese trading community who had settled there in the late 16th century:\nThese texts appear to record a Zhangzhou dialect, from the area of Haicheng (an old port that is now part of Longhai).\n\nChinese scholars produced rhyme dictionaries describing Hokkien varieties at the beginning of the 19th century:\nWalter Henry Medhurst based his 1832 dictionary on the latter work.\n\nHokkien has one of the most diverse phoneme inventories among Chinese varieties, with more consonants than Standard Mandarin, Cantonese and Shanghainese. Vowels are more-or-less similar to that of Standard Mandarin. Hokkien varieties retain many pronunciations that are no longer found in other Chinese varieties. These include the retention of the initial, which is now (Pinyin 'zh') in Mandarin (e.g. 'bamboo' 竹 is \"tik\", but \"zhú\" in Mandarin), having disappeared before the 6th century in other Chinese varieties.\n\nSouthern Min has aspirated, unaspirated as well as voiced consonant initials. For example, the word \"khui\" (; \"open\") and \"kuiⁿ\" (; \"close\") have the same vowel but differ only by aspiration of the initial and nasality of the vowel. In addition, Southern Min has labial initial consonants such as m in \"m̄-sī\" (; \"is not\").\n\nAnother example is 'da-po͘-kiáⁿ\" (; \"boy\") and \"cha-bó͘-kiáⁿ\" (; \"girl\"), which differ in the second syllable in consonant voicing and in tone.\n\nUnlike Mandarin, Hokkien retains all the final consonants corresponding to those of Middle Chinese. While Mandarin only preserves the n and ŋ finals, Southern Min also preserves the m, p, t and k finals and developed the ʔ (glottal stop).\n\nThe vowels of Hokkien are . \n\nThe following table illustrates some of the more commonly seen vowel shifts. Characters with the same vowel are shown in parentheses.\n\nIn general, Hokkien dialects have 5 to 7 phonemic tones. According to the traditional Chinese system, however, there are 7 to 9 tones if the two additional entering tones (see the discussion on Chinese tone). Tone sandhi is extensive. There are minor variations between the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou tone systems. Taiwanese tones follow the patterns of Amoy or Quanzhou, depending on the area of Taiwan. Many dialects have an additional phonemic tone (\"tone 9\" according to the traditional reckoning), used only in special or foreign loan words.\n\nThe Amoy dialect (Xiamen) is a hybrid of the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. Taiwanese is also a hybrid of these two dialects. Taiwanese in northern and coastal Taiwan tends to be based on the Quanzhou variety, whereas the Taiwanese spoken in central, south and inland Taiwan tends to be based on Zhangzhou speech. There are minor variations in pronunciation and vocabulary between Quanzhou and Zhangzhou dialects. The grammar is generally the same. Additionally, extensive contact with the Japanese language has left a legacy of Japanese loanwords in Taiwanese Hokkien. On the other hand, the variants spoken in Singapore and Malaysia have a substantial number of loanwords from Malay and to a lesser extent, from English and other Chinese varieties, such as the closely related Teochew and some Cantonese.\n\nPenang Hokkien and Medan Hokkien are based on Zhangzhou dialect, whereas Southern Peninsular Malaysian Hokkien is based on Quanzhou dialect.\n\nThe Quanzhou dialect, Xiamen dialect, Zhangzhou dialect and Taiwanese are generally mutually intelligible. The overseas varieties such as Penang Hokkien and Singaporean Hokkien are slightly less intelligible to speakers of mainland Min Nan and Taiwanese dialects due to the existence of foreign loanwords.\n\nThe Min Nan varieties of Teochew and Amoy are 84% phonetically similar, and 34% lexically similar, whereas Mandarin and Amoy Min Nan are 62% phonetically similar and 15% lexically similar. In comparison, German and English are 60% lexically similar.\n\nHainanese, which is sometimes considered Southern Min, has almost no mutual intelligibility with any form of Hokkien.\n\nHokkien is an analytic language; in a sentence, the arrangement of words is important to its meaning. A basic sentence follows the subject–verb–object pattern (i.e. a subject is followed by a verb then by an object), though this order is often violated because Hokkien dialects are topic-prominent. Unlike synthetic languages, seldom do words indicate time, gender and plural by inflection. Instead, these concepts are expressed through adverbs, aspect markers, and grammatical particles, or are deduced from the context. Different particles are added to a sentence to further specify its status or intonation.\n\nA verb itself indicates no grammatical tense. The time can be explicitly shown with time-indicating adverbs. Certain exceptions exist, however, according to the pragmatic interpretation of a verb's meaning. Additionally, an optional aspect particle can be appended to a verb to indicate the state of an action. Appending interrogative or exclamative particles to a sentence turns a statement into a question or shows the attitudes of the speaker.\n\nHokkien dialects preserve certain grammatical reflexes and patterns reminiscent of the broad stage of Archaic Chinese. This includes the serialization of verb phrases (direct linkage of verbs and verb phrases) and the infrequency of nominalization, both similar to Archaic Chinese grammar.\n\nChoice of grammatical function words also varies significantly among the Hokkien dialects. For instance, 乞 \"khit\" (denoting the causative, passive or dative) is retained in Jinjiang (also unique to the Jinjiang dialect is 度 \"thoo\") and in Jieyang, but not in Longxi and Xiamen, whose dialects use 互 (\"hoo\") instead.\n\nHokkien dialects differ in their preferred choice of pronouns. For instance, while the second person pronoun \"lí\" (你) is standard in Taiwanese Hokkien, the Teochew loanword \"lú\" (汝) is more common among Hokkien-speaking communities in Southeast Asia. The plural personal pronouns tend to be nasalized forms of the singular ones. Personal pronouns found in the Hokkien dialects are listed below:\n\nPossessive pronouns are marked by the particle \"ê\" (的), or its literary version \"chi\" (之). Plural pronouns are typically unmarked (the nasalized final serves as the possessive indicator):\n\nReflexive pronouns are made by appending the pronouns \"ka-kī, ka-tī\" (家己) or \"chū-kí\" (自己).\n\nHokkien dialects use a variety of differing demonstrative pronouns, which are as follows:\n\nThe interrogative pronouns are:\n\nStates and qualities are generally expressed using stative verbs that do not require the verb \"to be\":\n\nWith noun complements, the verb \"sī\" (是) serves as the verb \"to be\".\n\nTo indicate location, the words \"tī\" (佇) \"tiàm\" (踮), \"teh/leh\" (咧), which are collectively known as the locatives or sometimes coverbs in Chinese linguistics, are used to express \"(to be) at\":\n\nHokkien dialects have a variety of negation particles that are prefixed or affixed to the verbs they modify. There are five primary negation particles in Hokkien dialects:\n\nOther negative particles include:\n\nThe particles \"m̄\" (毋, 呣, 唔) is general and can negate almost any verb:\n\nThe particle \"mài\" (莫, 勿), a concatenation of \"m-ài\" (毋愛) is used to negate imperative commands:\n\nThe particle \"bô\" (無) indicates the past tense:\n\nThe verb 'to have', \"ū\" (有) is replaced by \"bô\" (無) when negated (not 無有):\n\nThe particle \"put\" (不) is used infrequently, mostly found in literary compounds and phrases:\n\nThe majority of Hokkien vocabulary is monosyllabic. Many Hokkien words have cognates in other Chinese varieties. That said, there are also many indigenous words that are unique to Hokkien and are potentially not of Sino-Tibetan origin, while others are shared by all the Min dialects (e.g. 'congee' is 糜 \"mê\", \"bôe\", \"bê\", not 粥 \"zhōu\", as in other dialects).\n\nAs compared to Standard Chinese (Mandarin), Hokkien dialects prefer to use the monosyllabic form of words, without suffixes. For instance, the Mandarin noun suffix 子 (zi) is not found in Hokkien words, while another noun suffix, 仔 (á) is used in many nouns. Examples are below:\n\nIn other bisyllabic morphemes, the syllables are inverted, as compared to Standard Chinese. Examples include the following:\n\nIn other cases, the same word can have different meanings in Hokkien and standard written Chinese. Similarly, depending on the region Hokkien is spoken in, loanwords from local languages (Malay, Tagalog, Burmese, among others), as well as other Chinese dialects (such as Southern Chinese dialects like Cantonese and Teochew), are commonly integrated into the vocabulary of Hokkien dialects.\n\nThe existence of literary and colloquial readings is a prominent feature of some Hokkien dialects and indeed in many Sinitic varieties in the south. The bulk of literary readings (, \"bûn-tha̍k\"), based on pronunciations of the vernacular during the Tang Dynasty, are mainly used in formal phrases and written language (e.g. philosophical concepts, surnames, and some place names), while the colloquial (or vernacular) ones (, \"pe̍h-tha̍k\") are basically used in spoken language and vulgar phrases. Literary readings are more similar to the pronunciations of the Tang standard of Middle Chinese than their colloquial equivalents. \n\nHowever, some dialects of Hokkien, such as Penang Hokkien as well as Philippine Hokkien overwhelmingly favor colloquial readings. For example, in both Penang Hokkien and Philippine Hokkien, the characters for 'university,' 大學, are pronounced \"tōa-o̍h\" (colloquial readings for both characters), instead of the literary reading \"tāi-ha̍k\", which is common in Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese dialects.\n\nThe pronounced divergence between literary and colloquial pronunciations found in Hokkien dialects is attributed to the presence of several strata in the Min lexicon. The earliest, colloquial stratum is traced to the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE); the second colloquial one comes from the period of the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420 - 589 CE); the third stratum of pronunciations (typically literary ones) comes from the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE) and is based on the prestige dialect of Chang'an (modern day Xi'an), its capital.\n\nSome commonly seen sound correspondences (colloquial → literary) are as follows:\n\nThis table displays some widely used characters in Hokkien that have both literary and colloquial readings:\n\nThis feature extends to Chinese numerals, which have both literary and colloquial readings. Literary readings are typically used when the numerals are read out loud (e.g. phone numbers), while colloquial readings are used for counting items.\nQuite a few words from the variety of Old Chinese spoken in the state of Wu, where the ancestral language of Min and Wu dialect families originated, and later words from Middle Chinese as well, have retained the original meanings in Hokkien, while many of their counterparts in Mandarin Chinese have either fallen out of daily use, have been substituted with other words (some of which are borrowed from other languages while others are new developments), or have developed newer meanings. The same may be said of Hokkien as well, since some lexical meaning evolved in step with Mandarin while others are wholly innovative developments.\n\nThis table shows some Hokkien dialect words from Classical Chinese, as contrasted to the written Chinese standard, Mandarin:\nFor other words, the classical Chinese meanings of certain words, which are retained in Hokkien dialects, have evolved or deviated significantly in other Chinese dialects. The following table shows some words that are both used in both Hokkien dialects and Mandarin Chinese, while the meanings in Mandarin Chinese have been modified:\nSome commonly used words, shared by all Min Chinese dialects, came from the ancient Minyue languages. Jerry Norman suggested that these languages were Austroasiatic. Some terms are thought be cognates with words in Tai Kadai and Austronesian languages. They include the following examples, compared to the Fuzhou dialect, a Min Dong language:\nLoanwords are not unusual among Hokkien dialects, as speakers readily adopted indigenous terms of the languages they came in contact with. As a result, there is a plethora of loanwords that are not mutually comprehensible among Hokkien dialects.\n\nTaiwanese Hokkien, as a result of linguistic contact with Japanese and Formosan languages, contains many loanwords from these languages. Many words have also been formed as calques from Mandarin, and speakers will often directly use Mandarin vocabulary through codeswitching. Among these include the following examples:\n\nSingaporean Hokkien, Penang Hokkien and other Malaysian Hokkien dialects tend to draw loanwords from Malay, English as well as other Chinese dialects, primarily Teochew. Examples include:\n\nPhilippine Hokkien dialects, as a result of centuries-old contact with both Philippine language and Spanish also incorporate words from these languages. Examples include:\n\nHokkien originated from Quanzhou. After the Opium War in 1842, Xiamen (Amoy) became one of the major treaty ports to be opened for trade with the outside world. From the mid-19th century onwards, Xiamen slowly developed to become the political and economical center of the Hokkien speaking region in China. This caused Amoy dialect to gradually replace the position of dialect variants from Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. From the mid-19th century until the end of World War II, western diplomats usually learned Amoy as the preferred dialect if they were to communicate with the Hokkien-speaking populace in China or South-East Asia. In the 1940s and 1950s, Taiwan also held Amoy Minnan as its standard and tended to incline towards Amoy dialect.\n\nHowever, from the 1980s onwards, the development of Taiwanese Min Nan pop music and media industry in Taiwan caused the Hokkien cultural hub to shift from Xiamen to Taiwan. The flourishing Taiwanese Min Nan entertainment and media industry from Taiwan in the 1990s and early 21st century led Taiwan to emerge as the new significant cultural hub for Hokkien.\n\nIn the 1990s, marked by the liberalization of language development and mother tongue movement in Taiwan, Taiwanese Hokkien had undergone a fast pace in its development. In 1993, Taiwan became the first region in the world to implement the teaching of Taiwanese Hokkien in Taiwanese schools. In 2001, the local Taiwanese language program was further extended to all schools in Taiwan, and Taiwanese Hokkien became one of the compulsory local Taiwanese languages to be learned in schools. The mother tongue movement in Taiwan even influenced Xiamen (Amoy) to the point that in 2010, Xiamen also began to implement the teaching of Hokkien dialect in its schools. In 2007, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan also completed the standardization of Chinese characters used for writing Hokkien and developed Tai-lo as the standard Hokkien pronunciation and romanization guide. A number of universities in Taiwan also offer Taiwanese degree courses for training Hokkien-fluent talents to work for the Hokkien media industry and education. Taiwan also has its own Hokkien literary and cultural circles whereby Hokkien poets and writers compose poetry or literature in Hokkien.\n\nThus by the 21st century, Taiwan is one of the most significant Hokkien cultural hubs of the world. The historical changes and development in Taiwan had led Taiwanese Hokkien to become the more influential pole of the Hokkien dialect after the mid-20th century. Today, Taiwanese prestige dialect (Taiyu Youshiqiang/Tongxinqiang ), which is based on Tainan variant and heard on Taiwanese Hokkien media.\n\nHokkien dialects are typically written using Chinese characters (, \"Hàn-jī\"). However, the written script was and remains adapted to the literary form, which is based on classical Chinese, not the vernacular and spoken form. Furthermore, the character inventory used for Mandarin (standard written Chinese) does not correspond to Hokkien words, and there are a large number of informal characters (, \"thè-jī\" or \"thòe-jī\"; 'substitute characters') which are unique to Hokkien (as is the case with Cantonese). For instance, about 20 to 25% of Taiwanese morphemes lack an appropriate or standard Chinese character.\n\nWhile most Hokkien morphemes have standard designated characters, they are not always etymological or phono-semantic. Similar-sounding, similar-meaning or rare characters are commonly borrowed or substituted to represent a particular morpheme. Examples include \"beautiful\" ( \"bí\" is the literary form), whose vernacular morpheme \"suí\" is represented by characters like (an obsolete character), (a vernacular reading of this character) and even (transliteration of the sound \"suí\"), or \"tall\" ( \"ko\" is the literary form), whose morpheme \"kôan\" is . Common grammatical particles are not exempt; the negation particle \"m̄\" (not) is variously represented by , or , among others. In other cases, characters are invented to represent a particular morpheme (a common example is the character \"in\", which represents the personal pronoun \"they\"). In addition, some characters have multiple and unrelated pronunciations, adapted to represent Hokkien words. For example, the Hokkien word \"bah\" (\"meat\") has been reduced to the character , which has etymologically unrelated colloquial and literary readings (\"he̍k\" and \"jio̍k\", respectively). Another case is the word 'to eat,' \"chia̍h\", which is often transcribed in Taiwanese newspapers and media as (a Mandarin transliteration, \"xiā\", to approximate the Hokkien term), even though its recommended character in dictionaries is .\n\nMoreover, unlike Cantonese, Hokkien does not have a universally accepted standardized character set. Thus, there is some variation in the characters used to express certain words and characters can be ambiguous in meaning. In 2007, the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China formulated and released a standard character set to overcome these difficulties. These standard Chinese characters for writing Taiwanese Hokkien are now taught in schools in Taiwan.\n\nHokkien, especially Taiwanese Hokkien, is sometimes written in the Latin script using one of several alphabets. Of these the most popular is POJ, developed first by Presbyterian missionaries in China and later by the indigenous Presbyterian Church in Taiwan. Use of this script and orthography has been actively promoted since the late 19th century. The use of a mixed script of Han characters and Latin letters is also seen, though remains uncommon. Other Latin-based alphabets also exist.\n\nMin Nan texts, all Hokkien, can be dated back to the 16th century. One example is the \"Doctrina Christiana en letra y lengua china\", presumably written after 1587 by the Spanish Dominicans in the Philippines. Another is a Ming Dynasty script of a play called \"Tale of the Lychee Mirror\" (1566), supposedly the earliest Southern Min colloquial text, although it is written in Teochew dialect.\n\nTaiwan has developed a Latin alphabet for Taiwanese Hokkien, derived from POJ, known as Tai-lo. Since 2006, it has been officially promoted by Taiwan's Ministry of Education and taught in Taiwanese schools. Xiamen University has also developed an alphabet based on Pinyin called Bbánlám pìngyīm.\n\nHokkien is registered as \"Southern Min\" per RFC 3066 as zh-min-nan.\n\nWhen writing Hokkien in Chinese characters, some writers create 'new' characters when they consider it impossible to use directly or borrow existing ones; this corresponds to similar practices in character usage in Cantonese, Vietnamese chữ nôm, Korean hanja and Japanese kanji. Some of these are not encoded in Unicode (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: Universal Character Set), thus creating problems in computer processing.\n\nAll Latin characters required by Pe̍h-ōe-jī can be represented using Unicode (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: Universal Character Set), using precomposed or combining (diacritics) characters. Prior to June 2004, the vowel akin to but more open than \"o\", written with a dot above right, was not encoded. The usual workaround was to use the (stand-alone; spacing) character \"Interpunct\" (U+00B7, \"·\") or less commonly the combining character \"dot above\" (U+0307). As these are far from ideal, since 1997 proposals have been submitted to the ISO/IEC working group in charge of ISO/IEC 10646—namely, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2—to encode a new combining character \"dot above right\". This is now officially assigned to U+0358 (see documents N1593, N2507, N2628,\nN2699, and N2713). Font support is expected to follow.\n\nHokkien (or Min Nan) can trace its roots through the Tang Dynasty and also even further to the people of the Baiyue, the indigenous non-Han people of modern-day southern China. Min Nan (Hokkien) people call themselves \"Tang people,\" () which is synonymous to \"Chinese people\". Because of the widespread influence of the Tang culture during the great Tang dynasty, there are today still many Min Nan pronunciations of words shared by the Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese languages.\n\nIn 2002, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, a party with about 10% of the Legislative Yuan seats at the time, suggested making Taiwanese a second official language. This proposal encountered strong opposition not only from Mainlander groups but also from Hakka and Taiwanese aboriginal groups who felt that it would slight their home languages, as well as others including Hoklo who objected to the proposal on logistical grounds and on the grounds that it would increase ethnic tensions. Because of these objections, support for this measure was lukewarm among moderate Taiwan independence supporters, and the proposal did not pass.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8432841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8432841", "title": "Imperial Manila", "text": "Imperial Manila\n\nImperial Manila is a pejorative epithet used by sectors of Philippine society and non-Manileños to express the idea that all the affairs of the Philippines, whether in politics, economy and business or culture, are decided by what goes on in the capital region, Metro Manila without considering the needs of the rest of the country, largely because of centralized government and urbanite snobbery.\n\nThis sentiment is sometimes expressed by the proverb \"Not a leaf can fall in our country without Malacañang's permission.\" Another expression of Manila's powerful influence was voiced by National Artist of the Philippines Nick Joaquin, who said \" “When Manila sneezes, the Philippines catches cold.”\n\nIt is unknown when the term was first used, but there are political writers, particularly those living outside Metro Manila, who associate this term with the People Power Revolution because it was believed that the country's former president, Ferdinand Marcos, was toppled from his position without the participation of Filipinos living in areas outside of the capital region. In the 1970s, Marcos borrowed $2.5 billion USD from the World Bank in order to establish Manila as a globally-competitive city. The funding facilitated government-backed expenditures on infrastructure and urban developments that displaced and relocated the urban poor while benefitting elites, who were able to profit.\n\nIn an article published in Philippine Daily Inquirer, Amando Doronila wrote that:\n\nThe term was used by Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in her 2006 State of the Nation Address, which she said has \"slowed down progress, has become open to over-competition and oppressed the provinces and its people\". It was because of the country's centralized government that provincial governments favor constitutional amendments for a shift to federal government, as well as supporting Arroyo and rejecting calls from Manila-based activist groups demanding for her resignation due to corruption charges particularly the Philippine National Broadband Network controversy.\n\nLocal opinion polls have also been lambasted for solely sampling \"Imperial Manila-based residents\" when it comes to surveys that deal with nationwide issues. Meanwhile, the term also appears in government websites such as those of the League of Provinces and the Province of Bohol.\n\nOfficials of Mindanao-based rebel group Moro Islamic Liberation Front have blamed \"Imperial Manila\" for making the Muslim Mindanao region the poorest in the country, stating that \"the consequence of neocolonialism has deprived our people to run themselves unfettered and unhampered.\" Government figures show that the region's poverty incidence in 2006 is at 55.3%, with three of its six provinces (namely Tawi-Tawi, Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur) listed among the country's ten poorest provinces.\n\n\"Imperial Manila\" is also used by many in the business sector in reference to the notion that advertising or marketing a product only requires a single campaign that would work in Mega Manila (another Manilacentric term used most frequently by the media), thinking that it would also attract customers in the provinces. Advertising agencies in Metro Manila are also faulted for publishing print advertisements in Manila-based newspapers that would reach other cities by mid-morning (when the residents have already read their own local daily) or running a television commercial at a primetime slot of 21:00 in Manila while the rest of the country is already asleep.\n\nIn 2009, economists from the University of the Philippines and the World Bank made statements encouraging the Philippine government to further concentrate national economic activity within Metro Manila rather than disperse it around the country. Meanwhile, in some parts of Luzon, in some scattered areas in Visayas and in Mindanao, rolling blackouts happen almost daily. Metro Manila commuters, too, many of whom have had to leave their families in other parts of the country in order to look for work, suffer from the effects of traffic congestion.\n\nThe term is also used, particularly in Cebu, in conjunction with the perceived imposition of the Tagalog language, which is the language not just of Manila but also of many of the country's other provinces, as a national language. The provincial government has even mandated that the national anthem be sung in Cebuano as a form of linguistic protest, in spite of a law that punishes the singing of the national anthem in languages other than Tagalog with fine or imprisonment. In response, some academics have called either for the overthrow of local government officials who resist official Manilacentrism or, more recently, the ostracism and outright \"shooting [of] regionalists … pointblank in the head\".\n\nThe legal imposition of Tagalog as a national symbol also has social implications, such as pressure to use the words \"po\" and \"opo\" (a contraction of \"oo po\", honorifics used for elders and persons of authority), honorifics which have no equivalent in most other indigenous languages in the country. Attempts have also been made to bring the orthographic conventions of other languages closer to those of Tagalog.\n\nNotably, Tagalog-speakers themselves who are not from the capital region (e.g. CALABARZON or MIMAROPA) are often derided as unsophisticated \"promdi\" (hicks or country bumpkins) because of their accent, grammar, vocabulary or rural customs.\n"}

The term is believed to have come about in the decade of the 2000s, although the concept had existed considerably before then.\n\nThe concept of a gender specific trip has \"been around since the first caveman took his club and went hunting with the others in the tribe.\" Yet, mancation has become a buzzword in the travel business lately. Tapping into the success of marketing all-girls getaway packages, hotels and resorts have started featuring all-male bonding vacation packages that include everything from poker, to extreme sports, to spa treatments. Golfing is the most popular activity for all-male vacation groups, but destinations have developed unique programs to accommodate the growing trend. The latest mancation packages offer spiritual healing, culinary instruction, yoga, and sexual reawakening.\n\nIn promoting mancations, some organizers \"have discovered that men tend to create ‘micro affinity groups’ in childhood, college, or grad school, and that the groups often take trips together.\" According to one online survey, about 34% of male respondents take at least one mancation every year. It is estimated that about 20 million American men go on mancations every year and collectively spend between $10 billion to $12 billion during these excursions. The majority of these men are married and between the ages of thirty to fifty-five years old.\n\nDuring the summer of 2006, half of the Fairmont Hotel chain’s 50 properties in the United States created mancation packages. For example, the Fairmont Chicago mancation package consists of a three-course steak dinner, a cocktail seminar, whiskey tasting, cigars, and poker.\n\nA 2008 study conducted by the Synovate research firm showed that 42% of men have taken a mancation, and 42% would like to in the future. The Jim Beam and Knob Creek bourbon brands used the statistics to promote a guys' trip to the Bourbon Trail in Kentucky for National Bourbon Heritage Month, occurring annually in September.\n\nDuring the summer of 2006, actor Vince Vaughn said it in the romantic comedy film \"The Break-Up\", written by Jay Lavender and Jeremy Garelick, stating: \"I’m excited.

{"id": "531232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531232", "title": "Moshe Feiglin", "text": "Moshe Feiglin\n\nMoshe Zalman Feiglin (, born 31 July 1962) is an Israeli politician and columnist, and the leader of libertarian Zionist party Zehut. A former member of Likud, he headed the Manhigut Yehudit (\"Jewish Leadership\") faction within the party, and represented Likud in the Knesset between 2013 and 2015.\n\nPrior to becoming a Knesset member, Feiglin co-founded the Zo Artzeinu (\"This is our Land\") movement with Shmuel Sackett in 1993 to protest the Oslo Accords. On 8 August 1995, eighty intersections throughout the country were blocked in a massive act of civil disobedience against the Oslo process. As a result of his activities, Feiglin was sentenced to six months in prison in 1997 for sedition against the state by Israel's Supreme Court. The sentence was later commuted to community service. In November 1996, Feiglin established the Manhigut Yehudit movement; it joined Likud in 2000, with Feiglin declaring that he would be a candidate for chairmanship of the party as a springboard for premiership of the State of Israel.\n\nIn early January 2015, Feiglin announced that he was leaving the Likud and forming his own party, after his poor showing in the Likud primaries the previous month. However, he was unable to form a new party in time for the Knesset elections in March.\n\nFeiglin was born in Haifa in 1962, the son of Ya'akov Zvi and Esther Feiglin. His ancestors moved to Palestine from Imperial Russia during the First Aliyah. His grandfather was the first child born in Metula, and some of his ancestors were among the founders of several settlements, including Mishmar HaYarden, Hadera, and Kinneret. His father served in the Jewish Settlement Police during the British Mandate era. His family later moved to Rehovot, where he attended the local Tachkemoni school of the Mizrachi movement, and subsequently graduated from Rabbi Haim Drukman's Yeshivat Or Etzion.\n\nFeiglin enlisted in the Israeli army for the full mandatory three-year term, despite the fact that the commonly accepted enlistment path among religiously observant Israelis is through the Hesder program, which allows Orthodox Jewish men to pursue religious studies for a year and a half at an approved Yeshiva, and have that time deducted from their mandatory service. During his IDF national service, Feiglin served in the Engineering Corps. He later signed on to one additional year as a career soldier, and attained the rank of Captain. He fought in the 1982 Lebanon War.\n\nFeiglin once ran a company that used rope rappelling in the construction industry.\n\nFeiglin co-founded the Manhigut Yehudit movement in 1996. It began as a brainchild of Feiglin and a friend of his, Moti Karpel, who established the organization as the continuation of the Zo Artzeinu protest movement. The main tactical difference between the two in Feiglin's thought is that Zo Artzeinu protested government policy without suggesting an alternative, whereas Manhigut Yehudit seeks to become the government and be the alternative.\n\nLacking the tools to do this, and without a political party with which to stake his run, he was approached by a founding member of the Likud party and participant in the Zo Artzeinu protests who proposed that Feiglin register for the Likud party and register, in turn, the thousands who participated in the protests, thereby building a support base for himself in the party, from which he could run for the party presidency and, in turn, Prime Minister.\n\nAccording to Feiglin's own words, Manhigut Yehudit was started to \"return the country to the people and lead the State of Israel through authentic Jewish values\". Feiglin has demanded that Israeli schools stop teaching the Arab view of the history of Israel, such as describing the creation of the State of Israel as a disaster (\"nakba\" in Arabic).\n\nFeiglin says that the movement's leadership will arise from \"those who have a deep commitment to Torah values\". Still, 30 percent of its present members are secular (2005). He opposes the surrender of what he regards as Jewish land, and has demanded the government take action against the estimated 50,000 illegal Arab structures built throughout the country. Feiglin has stated that Likud had \"given up true Likud values and acquiesced in the Gaza evacuation\".\n\nFeiglin has been on public record supporting the transfer of those Arab citizens of Israel who do not accept Jewish sovereignty over the state. This emigration would be encouraged with financial incentives.\n\nIn December 2005, Feiglin ran for Likud chairman and won 12.5% of the votes, coming third out of seven candidates, after Benjamin Netanyahu and Silvan Shalom. He attempted to run for a slot on the party's Knesset list, but encountered severe opposition from Netanyahu, who delayed party elections and advocated making changes to its charter to bar \"anyone who has served three or more months in prison\" from running as a Likud MK. This would have prevented Feiglin, who served a six-month sentence in the mid-1990s for civil disobedience, from running for either an MK or leadership position in the future. Feiglin withdrew from the race on 3 January 2006, following the release of a statement from the Likud party election chairman declaring, in agreement with a prior decision by the Israeli High Court, that Feiglin's conviction was not for \"dishonorable\" violations of the law, allowing him to participate in future Likud affairs.\n\nIn the 14 August 2007 primaries, Feiglin nearly doubled his previous showing and received 23.4% of the votes to Netanyahu's 72.8%. Netanyahu, fearing a strong showing by Feiglin, tried to have him ousted from the party prior to the vote, and said he would continue such efforts. On 10 December 2008, Feiglin was won twentieth place in the Likud primaries. On 11 December, following a petition submitted against him by Ophir Akunis, he was demoted to the 36th spot.\n\nIn an article written in 2009, Feiglin stated: \"Sad to say, Prime Minister Netanyahu is a pitiful puppet of Peres and his cohorts.\"\n\nFeiglin ran against Netanyahu again in the 2012 Likud leadership election, held on 31 January 2012, and again received 23% of the vote. In the Likud primaries held in late 2012 to select candidates for the 2013 elections, Feiglin finished thirteenth, and was elected to the Knesset in the 2013 elections.\n\nFeiglin served as Deputy Speaker in the 19th Knesset. He and his Manhigut Yehudit faction suffered a serious setback in the December 2014 Likud primaries, held in the run-up to the 2015 Knesset elections, when he fell to the 36th position on the Likud list, making it unlikely he would be returned to the Knesset. In January 2015, he announced that he was leaving Likud to form his own party, although he did not do so in time for the elections. Shortly after the elections, he announced that the new party was to be called Zehut (\"Identity\").\n\nFeiglin has openly stated that, though he is not opposed to peace, peace is not his goal, and would not be on the top of his agenda as Prime Minister. Rather, Feiglin's focus is on reforming Israel as an essentially Jewish State by acting on several campaigns on the religious, social, legal, and security fronts.\n\nIn a September 2014 article, Israel National News website wrote that, \"MK Feiglin is widely recognized as a brilliant intellectual with highly original thoughts on numerous issues, including a libertarian philosophy that appeals to many non-religious people.\" In a May 2012 article on liberty that originally appeared on the NRG \"Maariv\" Hebrew website, Feiglin wrote: \"Liberty means fighting against coercion of all kinds; religious, anti-religious, economic, cultural, educational, and more. Liberty means allocating state land to the citizen. It means privatization of government firms to the public, and not to core shareholders. Liberty means liberalized communication - broadcasting license and not broadcast franchise. You want to open up a television or radio station? Buy a wavelength and broadcast as you please within the framework of the law. Liberty means restoring the responsibility for education to the parents, using the education coupon method. It means a gradual transfer to a professional volunteer army. Liberty means prohibiting biometric data bases or any other type of human designation. There is no difference in principle between sophisticated biological marking and tattooing an ID number; both turn our identities into the property of a third party. In both, we lose our freedom. Simply put: We have one G-d above us, and we should not be enslaved to another person or mechanism. The state is ours, and under no circumstance is the opposite true.\"\n\nEven though Feiglin is Orthodox, he is against religious coercion, and is even against the establishment of religious political parties. He has come out against legislation such as the Chametz Law, which forbids selling leavened products on the Passover Holiday, when eating or owning leavened food products is prohibited by Jewish law.\n\nHe is also a proponent of the civil marriage initiative in Israel which would allow any Israeli citizen to marry without the auspices of a religious cleric. At present, marriage in Israel is impossible outside the confines of a religious system; hence, for tens of thousands of people with problematic religious status, it is impossible ever to get married in the country. The present system also places the power of divorce in the hand of the Religious courts, who are answerable only to the Supreme Courts. The civil marriage initiative would make the religious nature of marriage entirely voluntary, effectively separating religion and state in this matter.\n\nFeiglin has advocated removing the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf's control over the entire al-Aqsa complex, and suggested a synagogue should be established on the Temple Mount. In February 2014, at Feiglin's insistence, the Knesset debated the status of the Temple Mount.\nFeiglin's platform states:\n\n\"We have to internalize that this is our Land - exclusively... Most important: We must expel the Moslem wakf from the Temple Mount and restore exclusive Israeli sovereignty over this most holy site.\"\n\nIn July 2014, during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Feiglin outlined steps toward \"achieving quiet in Gaza\". His plan included attacking all of Gaza, its infrastructure and military sites, without regard to civilian \"human shields\". After conquering and annexing Gaza into Israel, that portion of Gaza's \"enemy population that is innocent of wrong-doing and separated itself from the armed terrorists will be treated in accordance with international law and will be allowed to leave\". After becoming part of Israel, Gaza would be re-populated by Jews. He said the civilians of Gaza could go to Sinai, and his plan would also \"ease the housing crisis in Israel\".\n\nOn August 4, 2014, the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper alleged that Feiglin had called for concentration camps in Gaza, \"the conquest of the entire Gaza Strip, and annihilation of all fighting forces and their supporters\", and also for shipping the people living in Gaza across the world\". In a TV show with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Feiglin denied that claim, saying he was talking about creating \"sheltered areas\" for the civilians of Gaza so that Israel could stop rockets by Hamas in a more effective way. He also said that he \"definitely\" supported \"tent encampments\" before the people in Gaza can be relocated to another place.\n\nFeiglin has proposed a plan to end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. His plan would include annexing all post-1967 land currently in Israel's hands and offering financial incentive for Palestinian families in these areas to emigrate to other countries.\nFeiglin pointed to a poll by An-Najah University in Nablus, which showed that one in three Palestinian Arabs would emigrate to other countries even without a financial incentive, as supporting his plan. Feiglin also proposed that Israel actively encourage Israeli-Arabs to emigrate to the Arab world, and provide assistance to any Arab who chooses to do so.\n\nAbout 20% of Israel's citizens are Israeli Arabs. Feiglin was asked about Israel's status as a \"Jewish and democratic state\" in a 2004 interview, and stated: \"Why should non-Jews have a say in the policy of a Jewish state?... For two thousand years, Jews dreamed of a Jewish state, not a democratic state. Democracy should serve the values of the state, not destroy them...\"\n\nIn a 2003 posting on the Manhigut Yehudit website (Hebrew version) setting forth a 20-point political program of his most important policy changes, Feiglin proposed replacing the Knesset with a bicameral legislature, whose upper house, which would control all \"national affairs\", would be \"composed exclusively of Jews\". The article was entitled, \"Feiglin's First Hundred Days as Prime Minister\". Point three in the program states that he will enact a new Basic Law which will set forth a detailed proposal for a constitution. The Law will replace the at-large election of the Knesset with regional representatives, and would also create a lower house to handle municipal issues, in which Israeli Arabs could be represented. The posting was taken down on Dec. 9, 2008, the day after Feiglin won twentieth place in the Likud primaries. However, the posting had been archived by Israeli scholar Tomer Persico prior to being removed, and Persico wrote a 2012 article analyzing Feiglin's program, referencing the 2003 posting.\n\nIn his 2005 book \"War of Dreams\", Feiglin wrote that his program was: \"Israeli citizenship to Jews only [and] the immediate expulsion of any person of another people who claims any sort of sovereignty in the Land of Israel.\"\n\n\"We are busy fighting for Yesha, and refuse to recognize the more dangerous front against the fifth column inside Israel.\" \"We established a state so that we could stop being different and start being normal. If only Jews can be Israelis, then we will never be normal. . . .The fundamental solution is leadership that is not looking for normalcy. The solution is leadership that emphasizes our Jewish identity. Paradoxically, it is only when the Arabs understand that the Israelis do not need them to help them to forget that they are Jews - will we be able to live here in peace with non-Jews who unequivocally accept the fact that Israel is a Jewish state.\"\n\nIt appears that the Israeli Arabs identify with our enemies. There are laws in this country that deal with treason and they should be applied when required. If Israeli Arabs are found helping our enemies, they should be stripped of their citizenship. In addition, if they are citizens, they should not be exempt from paying taxes; they should serve in the IDF, or at least in Sherut Le'umi, the National Service. . . . .If they are against us, we must make every effort to ensure that they leave. If they collaborate with our enemy, they must be removed.\n\nFeiglin's 2013 campaign set forth his legislative agenda regarding Israeli Arabs: \"Zero tolerance for Arab citizens' defiance. Enforcement of laws of treason. Enforcement of laws against robbery, rape, and vandalism.\" Feiglin has repeatedly made clear his view that only Jews deserve to be full citizens of Israel.\n\nThe momentum toward citizenship for all residents of Israel, regardless of their religion, is part of the Zionist ideology based on Western culture. If not checked, it will effectively transform Israel from a Jewish state to a state with some Jewish citizens.\n\nThe Arab sector is not loyal to the state, and does not serve in the army. \n\nFeiglin, responding to a report that Israel's first permanent Arab Supreme Court judge Salim Joubran had refused to sing Israel's national anthem, asserted that Joubran \"must return his Israeli ID card and make do with the status of 'permanent resident'\".\n\nOf Israeli Arabs, Feiglin said, \"They will have to seek the right to self-determination in Arab states. Israel will encourage the Arabs to emigrate to their countries and assist any Arab who wishes to do so.\" Feiglin was quoted as saying: He insisted there is no such thing as a Palestinian people, and that they and Israeli Arabs should relocate, citing a text he had posted on the website of his Manhigut Yehudit (\"Jewish Leadership\") movement. In a 2004 interview with Yedioth Ahronoth, he spoke of \"a voluntary transfer to the 22 neighbouring Arab states\" of the some 1.4 million Israeli Arabs, who make up 20 percent of Israel's population. \"Arabs are not the sons of the desert, but its father\", he quoted Sir Claude Jarvis, British governor of Sinai from 1923.\n\nArabs are \"a gang of bandits that never produced anything and never wanted to produce anything - a gang of bandits that for over one thousand years (since Islam was born) has lived on robbery and terror. . . . Since their establishment, the Arab states have produced nothing but poverty, suffering, wars - and fantastic wealth for their leaders.\"\n\nThe Arabs engage in typical Amalek behaviour. I can't prove this genetically but this is the behaviour of Amalek.\n\nWe shall offer them human rights without civil rights, so long as they prove their loyalty to their Jewish state host and accept Jewish sovereignty over their land. In such a situation they will be given legal-resident status and they can carry on their private affairs without anyone infringing on their human rights.\n\nIn a 2004 report by Jeffrey Goldberg in the New Yorker magazine, Feiglin was quoted as saying:\n\nWhy should non-Jews have a say in the policy of a Jewish state?... For two thousand years, Jews dreamed of a Jewish state, not a democratic state. Democracy should serve the values of the state, not destroy them... You can’t teach a monkey to speak and you can’t teach an Arab to be democratic. You’re dealing with a culture of thieves and robbers.The Arab destroys everything he touches.\n\nOn his website, Feiglin wrote:\n\nWe all know that most of the fires in Israel are caused by arson. Arson perpetrated by Arabs. Not by nut-jobs, not by criminals. Arson motivated by nationalism. Arson by Arab citizens of Israel. ... Wherever the Arab goes, he brings the desert with him. ... There is not and there never will be democracy in the Arab states - and their economies will never flourish. Israel produces more than all its neighbors combined. That is not because we are extremely industrious. It is because true economic vitality cannot exist in a culture of robbery. ... Arab culture is anti-productive. It has no good and bad, only strong and weak.\n\nIn an interview with the U.S.-based Jewish Press, Feiglin said:\nYou can find places where we say the same things. You can also find places where we are different. I was in the army when Meir, Hashem yikom damo [may God avenge his blood], was [most] active, so I didn't get to know him so well. But I can definitely say that the slogan \"Kahane tzadak - Kahane was right\" has proven itself many times. \n\nSeveral left-wing or Arab commentators have depicted Feiglin as fascist, but for his part, Feiglin rejects this label, claiming that he is fighting fascism himself.\n\nAccording to a 2012 article in \"Haaretz\" daily, Feiglin condemned Baruch Goldstein over his killing of 29 Palestinian Muslims in a mosque in the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre, though he did not condemn Goldstein's motivations.\n\nIn an article in Ha'aretz, Yossi Sarid quoted Feiglin, in the context of demonstrations against the democratically chosen Oslo accords, as saying, \"Hitler was an unparalleled military genius. Nazism promoted Germany from a low to a fantastic physical and ideological status. The ragged, trashy youth body turned into a neat and orderly part of society and Germany received an exemplary regime, a proper justice system and public order. Hitler savored good music. He would paint. This was no bunch of thugs. They merely used thugs and homosexuals.\" Feiglin clarified his position to the Maariv newspaper that just because he considers Hitler a military genius, this does not mean he admires him. In an interview on Israeli television, Feiglin accused Sarid and other left-wing journalists of a smear campaign against him by quoting him out of context. He explained his point as saying that just because Germany was a democracy, this does not give legitimacy to what Hitler had done.\n\nFeiglin is banned from entering the United Kingdom due to a decision by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, made public in March 2008, excluding Feiglin on the grounds that his presence in the country \"would not be conducive to the public good\". A letter to Feiglin from the Home Office said that Smith based her decision on an assessment that his activities \"foment or justify terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs; seek to provoke others to terrorist acts; foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to serious criminal acts; and foster hatred, which might lead to inter-community violence in the UK\". Feiglin responded, \"Seeing that renowned terrorists like Hizbullah member Ibrahim Mousawi are welcomed in your country in open arms, I understand that your policy is aimed at encouraging and supporting terror.\"\n\nFeiglin was arrested for organizing mass acts of resistance and blocked highways across Israel during the period in which the Oslo accords were debated and implemented. Feiglin was charged with \"break[ing] the barrier of obedience to the rule of law\" and incitement to commit crimes. Regarding his organization of peaceful demonstrations and the blocking of intersections without a permit, Feiglin was quoted as stating, \"We will do all that it's possible to do, including breaking the law.\"\nHe was sentenced to six months in prison in 1997 for sedition, and the sentence was later performed via community service.\n\nRelations between Feiglin and his fellow Likud members have been mixed. Likud Knesset member Limor Livnat stated that Feiglin and his friends are \"not real Likudniks\", and that his faction \"cannot be allowed to prevail\". In an interview with the Jerusalem Post, Livnat explained that Feiglin and his faction must be prevented \"from taking over, or the party and the state will be in danger\", adding that, \"this is not democracy, this is anarchy\".\n\nDespite criticism from fellow Likud members, Feiglin has displayed favorable relations with a significant number of former Likud Knesset members. This was manifest during a Feiglin rally at Jerusalem's Ramada Hotel that took place before the 2008 Likud primary after Feiglin promised to throw all his votes to them if they showed up. Former Likud Knesset members Gila Gamliel, David Mena, Daniel Benlulu, and Ayoub Kara attended the event, despite warnings from Netanyahu's advisers not to do so. Gila Gamliel, who did not vote against the Disengagement from Gaza, eventually took Feiglin's votes and placed 19th, one spot ahead of Feiglin. This ultimately resulted in Feiglin getting pushed down to the 36th spot, and out of the Eighteenth Knesset.\n\nFeiglin is a highly vocal supporter of Jonathan Pollard, a former American naval intelligence analyst who formerly served a sentence in the American Federal prison system for spying for Israel. Feiglin, who has called Pollard a hero, has written a number of articles in support of Pollard. In a recent article, Feiglin stated that, \"Pollard is a Jew who saved the Israelis from American treachery.\"\n\nFeiglin referred to U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden as a \"diseased leper\" in a 2010 op-ed column published by Israel's third-largest news outlet, Maariv.\n\nAs part of his libertarian political philosophy, Feiglin supports the full legalization of cannabis in Israel, stating of legalization in Amsterdam: \"I don't see Amsterdam as a bad thing. .. There's no chaos, there's more freedom for citizens. [Legalization] didn't upend the way of life.\" And stating that, \"This may be one of the reasons why marijuana is illegal. God owns the patent on cannabis, and the large pharmaceutical companies do not appreciate such an intervention in their market and exert their influence accordingly.\" The opposition of the Knesset Health committee to Feiglin's proposals have led to multiple controversial confrontations in the Knesset. Feiglin says that, \"When I expressed my opinion on this issue over a year ago, I had no idea that I had climbed atop such a potent barrel of social dynamite... The debate is not about cannabis. Cannabis is just the tip of the iceberg. The debate is about liberty.\"\n\nFeiglin wrote an article in 2009 entitled \"I Am A Proud Homophobe\". In 2012, he wrote several posts on his Facebook page detailing his views on gays. \"The gay pride parade isn't about rights. It's about forcing the values of the minority onto the majority, effectively locking the majority into the proverbial closet. Homosexual \"rights\" undermine the normative family, the foundation of our nation.\"\n\n\"\"Throughout history\", Feiglin explained, \"from Rome to Europe in our day, the approval and spread of homosexuality presaged the decline of nations and cultures. If one reads the Torah portion 'Noah' - this comes as no surprise. . . .The organizers of a pride parade do not wish to gain rights. They strive to force homosexuality as a culture upon the public sphere. . . . A minority has no right to take over public assets. Let the marchers kindly go back to their individual closets. And let them do it without whining, because no one interferes with their affairs in there. Let them give up their attempts at takeovers, and leave the public sphere to normal people. . . .Feiglin added in an additional post: \"I have no problem with homosexuals, most of whom are, most likely, good and talented people and no one wants to interfere in their private lives. I have a problem with homosexuality as a culture. This culture subverts the status of the family. And without the family there is no nation, and without a nation there is no civilization.\"\n\nFeiglin refused to meet with a gay faction within the Likud, and was quoting as stating: \"[A]s individuals I can’t tell them how to lead their lives and I can cooperate with them on different subjects, but as a group that tries to promote an ideology of their sexual orientation, I don’t think they have legitimacy, especially not in the Likud.\" On Feb. 7, 2013, Feiglin met with an Israeli gay advocacy group in Tel Aviv, and said he was no longer a homophobe. News accounts of the meeting reported Feiglin's views: \"'I am in favor of you having all your human rights, but I am not prepared by the way to invalidate the special value of the classic family', he said and made it clear that he still opposed gay marriage and same-sex parenting. 'Every child in the world has a right to a mother and father. It has nothing to do with religion, but with my basic perception of the good of the child', he said.\"\n\nAfter his election to the Knesset, Moshe Feiglin met with homosexual groups. Although he does not identify with their lifestyle choices, he told them, he supports their rights as individuals and will fight to ensure that those rights are upheld.\n\nWhen asked by a lesbian supporter if he would support her running in the primaries for the Zehut party, Feiglin was enthusiastically positive about it.\n\nDuring his 2013 campaign, Feiglin reiterated his view that women's role in Israeli society should be based on Jewish Biblical principles. In response to a question about feminism, Feiglin was quoted as saying: \"'Tel Aviv has become a city that has erased masculinity and where being a man is considered a sickness' and added that feminism has destroyed family values, something essential to Judaism. . . . Pressed further, he stated that 'the man is the family while the woman is the home [literally \"house\"]' and that in our current culture we are forgetting 'what it means to be a man.'\"\n\nWhen the Jerusalem city government voted to permit sex-segregated public buses, according to the wishes of some ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) Jews, Feiglin supported the action: \"I see discrimination against women as despicable. But it is unreasonable to force an ultra-Orthodox bus company to institute mixed seating on its buses against the wishes of its customers.\" Feiglin also opposes the Israeli army's decision to allow women into combat units.\n\nInstead of saying that we no longer need families, our lexicon now includes single parent families or same gender marriage. These newly introduced concepts are not contrived for the good of those parents raising their children without the support of a spouse (who should be benefiting from aid when needed). Instead, they revise the way we think of the traditional family -- compromising its preeminence and relegating it to \"just another option\" status.\n\nDuring the 2014 military operation in Gaza, Feiglin criticized lawmaker Aliza Lavie for discussing legislation on sexual violence, protesting that in wartime, no one should be \"talking about things like flowers and sexual assault\".\n\nFeiglin has criticized certain Christian supporters of Israel, such as Glenn Beck, and challenged the sincerity of Christians who have defended Israel, as well as Israeli Jews who supported Beck. \"Glenn Beck doesn't back the Jewish mission. What drives him is the Christian mission. I have no problem doing business with him, but he has to respect me when he comes here just like I don’t try to force my identity on him when I come to him. Jews like it when goyim finally smile at them, but sometimes, a smile is more dangerous than a scowl, and this is one of those occasions\", Feiglin said. Feiglin also said he had a “deep problem” with Efrat Chief Rabbi Shlomo Riskin participating as a featured speaker at a Christian prayer rally Glenn Beck organized at the Caesarea Amphitheater in Israel. Danny Danon responded to Feiglin, saying: \"Israel has too many real foes and very few genuine friends like Glenn Beck. I cannot understand the urge to reject his friendship with pseudo-theological argumentation... Rejecting friendship is not a sign of national pride but a proof of very low self confidence.\"\n\nIn December 2014, a group of academics who are part of the anti-BDS movement and members of The Third Narrative, a Labor Zionist organization, have called on the U.S. and E.U. to impose sanctions on Feiglin and three other Israelis \"who lead efforts to insure permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and to annex all or parts of it unilaterally in violation of international law\". These academics, calling themselves Scholars for Israel and Palestine (SIP) and claiming to be \"pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, pro-peace\", are asking the U.S. and EU to freeze Feiglin's foreign assets and impose visa restrictions. One of the signatories was quoted in Haaretz as saying the four leaders were chosen because they \"were particularly dismissive of Secretary of State Kerry's peace-making efforts, and explicitly call for and work towards the formal annexation of the West Bank or part of it, and thereby push Israel in the direction of violating international law. They are the ones who cross particularly sharp red lines.\" The group of mainly Jewish academics blasted Feiglin for his \"straightforward and undisguised extremism\" and \"annexationist\" agenda.\n\nFeiglin is the author of the Hebrew language books \"Where There Are No Men\", and \"War of Dreams\", has a column in both the Ma'ariv and Makor Rishon daily newspapers, and appears frequently on international TV and radio. He writes columns regularly for the Brooklyn-based Orthodox Jewish newspaper \"Jewish Press\" as well. Moshe and his wife Tzippy have five children, and three grandchildren. They live in the Israeli settlement of Karnei Shomron, in the Samaria region of the West Bank. Feiglin is an avid mountain biker, riding most mornings in the Samarian hills just outside his town. In addition to his native Hebrew, he is proficient in English.\n\n"}

Phil and Ph.D. degrees from the same university for his research on the Rakhaine aborigines of Bangladesh. Currently a senior executive in Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of the country, he worked as a journalist in different newspapers including the weekly Kishore Bangla. In addition to research, he writes poetry and has published a number of anthologies. Majid is known for his scientific positivism, imbibed with the ideals of Marxism, Leninism and thoughts of Mao Zedong. He is an organizer of children's organisation 'Kanchi-Kanchar Mela', a life member of Bangla Academy and an executive member of National Poetry Council of Bangladesh. He is also a member of the National Press Club. In 1971, he took part in the liberation war of Bangladesh. Majid is the General Manager of the Department of Public Relations and Publications, of Bangladesh Bank.\n\nMajid has carried out extensive on research on public administration, Dhaka University from the department of Public Administration. His endless curiosity about the small ethnic minorities living far away from the mainstream has produced pioneering books on ethnic communities like Manna, Garo, Hajong and Tripura as well as the Rakhaines. His research on the existence of Mongoloid community in Bangladesh is revealing.\n\nIn 2005, the Ph.D. thesis of Majid was published under the title \"The Rakhaines\". He worked on the Rakhaines for over twenty years. The Rakhaines of the coastal areas of Patuakhali, Borguna and Cox's Bazar migrated to what is now Bangladesh from Burma about two hundred years ago and turned the uncultivable deep forests of the coastal belt into a habitable area. Mustafa Majid informs that the Rakhaines are Mongoloid who have many problems including tyranny by the mainstream population, but being peace-loving they never choose to go for a protest or struggle. However, some have left the country in search of security. The book has seven chapters in which the author deals with theories of administration, identities of the Rakhaines and a chronicle of Patuakhali district, the anthropological identity of the Rakhaines, their land problems and the unsympathetic role played by the llocal administration in relation to their persistent problems. He suggested for planned governmental effort for their inclusion in the mainstream.\n\nMustafa Majid has published 34 books so far (2007) including 13 books on aboriginals of Bangladesh and 4 on public administration.

The week of events is scheduled the last week of January each year. As an organization it does not promote one form of educational choice over another, but rather contends that parents should have and make choices in the best interest of their children.\n\nThe week consists of independently organized events, both large and small, in schools, state capitols, and other public meetings featuring the movement's signature yellow scarves. Additionally there are several national signature events and press opportunities. In 2011 there were approximately 150 events in over 30 states. Each year the participation has more than doubled. In 2014 nearly 6,000 events held in every state had a media contact with over 100 million households in the United States.

He was a Manipuri (a language in the 8th schedule of the Indian constitution) singer. He was perhaps the most prolific modern Meitei singer before his death on 18 October 2006 in Imphal, Manipur, India.\n\nNongmaithem Pahari's greatest contribution to the culture of Manipur is the way he introduced a new era of music. He was important in consolidating the popularity of modern Meitei music.\n\nPahari was born on 28 August 1934 in Imphal, Manipur. His father, Nongmaithem Thanil, represented the nobility of that time and was an avid theatre activist. Pahari's affinity towards music was manifested early in his childhood when he was heavily influenced by the likes of KL Saigal, Pankaj Mallik and Mana Dey.\n\nOf the many albums that Pahari released during his lifetime, \"Undying Melodies\" is considered to be the \"magnum opus\".

{"id": "857148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=857148", "title": "Old Saxon", "text": "Old Saxon\n\nOld Saxon, also known as Old Low German, was a Germanic language and the earliest recorded form of Low German (spoken nowadays in Northern Germany, the northeastern Netherlands, southern Denmark, the Americas and parts of Eastern Europe). It is a West Germanic language, closely related to the Anglo-Frisian languages. It has been documented from the 8th century until the 12th century, when it gradually evolved into Middle Low German. It was spoken throughout modern northwestern Germany, primarily in the coastal regions and in the eastern Netherlands by Saxons, a Germanic tribe who inhabited the region of Saxony. It partially shares Anglo-Frisian's (Old Frisian, Old English) Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law which sets it apart from Low Franconian and Irminonic languages, such as Dutch, Luxembourgish and German.\n\nThe grammar of Old Saxon was fully inflected with five grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and instrumental), three grammatical numbers (singular, plural, and dual) and three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). The dual forms occurred in the first and second persons only and referred to groups of two.\n\nHistorically, Old Saxon and Old Dutch were considered to be distinct dialects of an otherwise one unitary language rather than two languages, primarily because they were linked through a dialect continuum spanning modern Netherlands and Germany. However, while these two languages both shared the same historical origins and some very similar writing styles, Old Saxon shows a slightly reduced morphology compared to Old Dutch, which kept some grammatical distinctions that Old Saxon abandoned. There are also various differences in their phonological evolutions, Old Saxon being classified as an Ingvaeonic language whereas Old Dutch is one of the Istvaeonic languages.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, a dialect continuum existed between Old Dutch and Old Saxon; this was only recently interrupted by the simultaneous dissemination of standard languages within each nation and the dissolution of folk dialects. Despite sharing some features, a number of disparities separate Old Saxon, Old English, and Old Dutch; one such difference is the Old Dutch utilization of \"-a\" as its plural a-stem noun ending, while Old Saxon and Old English employ \"-as\" or \"-os\". However, it seems that some Middle Dutch took the Old Saxon a-stem ending from some Middle Low German dialects, as modern Dutch still shows the plural ending \"-s\" added to certain words.\n\nOld Saxon (or Old Low German) probably evolved primarily from Ingvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic in the 5th century. However, Old Saxon, even if it is considered as an Ingvaeonic language, is not a pure Ingvaeonic dialect as Old Frisian and Old English are, the two latter sharing some other Ingvaeonic characteristics, like the great vowel shift that took place in both Old English and Old Frisian. This, plus the large number of different forms that the language took, often showing different West-Germanic features, led some philologists to mistakenly think that Old Dutch and Old Saxon were variations of the same language, and that Old Saxon was indeed an Istvaeonic language.\n\nOld Saxon naturally evolved into Middle Low German over the course of the 11th and 12th century, with a great shift from Latin to Low German writing happening around 1150, so that the development of the language can be traced from that period.\n\nThe most striking difference between Middle Low German and Old Saxon is in a feature of speech known as vowel reduction, which took place in the other West Germanic languages and some Scandinavian dialects such as Danish, reducing all unstressed vowels to schwa. Thus, such Old Saxon words like \"gisprekan\" (spoken) or \"dagō\" (days' – gen. pl.) became \"gesprēken \"and \"dāge\".\n\nOld Saxon did not participate in the High German consonant shift, and thus preserves stop consonants \"p\", \"t\", \"k\" that have been shifted in Old High German to various fricatives and affricates. The Germanic diphthongs \"ai\", \"au\" consistently develop into long vowels \"ē\", \"ō\", whereas in Old High German they appear either as \"ei\", \"ou\" or \"ē\", \"ō\" depending on the following consonant.\n\nOld Saxon, alone of the West Germanic languages except for Frisian, consistently preserves Germanic \"-j-\" after a consonant, e.g. \"savior\" (, , ). Germanic umlaut, when it occurs with short \"a\", is inconsistent, e.g. or \"to have\" (). This feature was carried over into the descendant-language of Old Saxon, Middle Low German, where e.g. the adjective \"krank\" (sick, ill) had the comparative forms \"krenker\" and \"kranker\". Apart from the \"e\", however, the umlaut is not marked in writing.\n\nThe table below lists the consonants of Old Saxon. Phonemes written in parentheses represent allophones and are not independent phonemes.\nNotes:\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\nUnlike modern English, but like Old English, Old Saxon is an inflected language, rich in morphological diversity. It kept several distinct cases from Proto-Germanic: the nominative, accusative, genitive, dative and (vestigially in the oldest texts) instrumental.\n\nOld Saxon also had three grammatical numbers (singular, and dual, and plural) and three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). The dual forms occurred in the first and second persons only and referred to groups of exactly two.\n\nOld Saxon nouns were inflected in very different ways following their classes. Here are the endings for \"dag\", \"day\" an a-stem masculine noun:\n\nAt the end of the Old Saxon period, distinctions between noun classes began to disappear, and endings from one were often transferred to the other declension, and vice versa. This happened to be a large process, and the most common noun classes started to cause the least represented to disappear. As a result, in Middle Low German, only the former weak n-stem and strong a-stem classes remained. These two noun inflection classes started being added to words not only following the historical belonging of this word, but also following the root of the word.\n\nThe Old Saxon verb inflection system reflects an intermediate stage between Old English and Old Dutch, and further Old High German. Unlike Old High German and Old Dutch, but similarly to Old English, it did not preserve the three different verb endings in the plural, all featured as \"-ad\" (also \"-iad\" or \"-iod\" following the different verb inflection classes). Like Old Dutch, it had only two classes of weak verb, with only a few relic verbs of the third weak class (namely four verbs: libbian, seggian, huggian and hebbian).\n\nThis table sums up all the seven Old Saxon strong verb classes and the three weak verb classes:\n\nIt should be noticed that the third weak verb class includes only four verbs (namely libbian, seggian, huggian and hebbian); it is a remnant of an older and larger class that was kept in Old High German.\n\nOld Saxon syntax is mostly different from that of English. Some were simply consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection – e.g., word order was generally freer. In addition:\n\nOld Saxon comes down in a number of different manuscripts whose spelling systems sometimes differ markedly. In this section, only the letters used in normalized versions of the Heliand will be kept, and the sounds modern scholars have traditionally assigned to these letters. Where spelling deviations in other texts may point to significant pronunciation variants, this will be indicated.\n\nIn general, the spelling of Old Saxon corresponds quite well to that of the other ancient Germanic languages, such as Old High German or Gothic.\n\n\nOnly a few texts survive, predominantly baptismal vows the Saxons were required to perform at the behest of Charlemagne. The only literary texts preserved are \"Heliand\" and fragments of the Old Saxon Genesis.\n\n\nA poetic version of the Lord's Prayer in the form of the traditional Germanic alliterative verse is given in Old Saxon below as it appears in the \"Heliand\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The prepress procedure includes the manufacture of a printing plate, image carrier or form, ready for mounting on a printing press, as well as the adjustment of images and texts or the creation of a high-quality print file.\nIn today's prepress shop, the form of delivery from the customer is usually electronic, either a PDF or application files created from such programs as Scribus, Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress.\n\nThe following items have each been considered part of prepress at one time or another: \n\nIn most modern publishing environments, the tasks related to content generation and refinement are carried out separately from other prepress tasks, and are commonly characterized as part of graphic design. Some companies combine the roles of graphic design and prepress production into desktop publishing usually called DTP.\n\nThe set of procedures used in any particular prepress environment is known as a workflow. Workflows vary, depending on the printing process (e.g., letterpress, offset, digital printing, screen printing), the final product (books, newspapers, product packaging), and the implementation of specific prepress technologies. For example, it is not uncommon to use a computer and image-setter to generate film which is then stripped and used to expose the plate in a vacuum frame; this workflow is hybrid because separation and halftoning are carried out via digital processes while the exposure of the plate is an analog one. That demonstrates that the borders around the prepress are very fluid. Furthermore, – depending on the printing method and the print product – the elements of the prepress of a graphic print production can differ from case to case. This circumstance requires a management of the workflow. It is necessary to manage the responsibility for each part of the workflow. That can mean that employees, who are actually responsible for other parts of the production (e.g. Layout), have to attend to parts of the prepress.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, computer-aided prepress techniques began to supplant the traditional dark room and light table processes, and by the early 2000s the word \"prepress\" became, in some ways, synonymous with digital pre-press. Immediately before the mainstream introduction of computers to the process, much of the industry was using large format cameras to make emulsion-based (film) copies of text and images. This film was then assembled (planning (UK) or stripping) and used to expose another layer of emulsion on a plate, thus copying images from one emulsion to another. This method is still used; however, as digital pre-press technology has become less cost intensive, more efficient and reliable, and as the knowledge and skill required to use the new hardware and especially software have become more widespread within the labor force, digital automation has been introduced to almost every part of the process. Some topics related to digital but not analog prepress include preflighting (verifying the presence, quality and format of each digital component), color management, and RIPping.\n\nPDF workflows also became predominant. Vendors of Prepress systems, in addition to the offset printing industry, embraced a subset of the PDF format referred to as PDF/X1-a. This industry specific subset is one version of the PDF/X (PDF for eXchange) set of standards.\n\nIn more recent years, prepress software has been developed which is designed to find as many efficiencies in prepress workflow as possible. These tools are accessed online, and allow different workers to work on one project at the same time, often from different locations. Key functionality automates common steps to reduce errors, reinforce quality standards and speed up production. Examples include automatically re-folioing pages, digital dummies for soft proofs, live linking with Adobe InDesign and pre-flight checking. These tools revolve around a Flatplan and are used in all sorts of prepress including book, magazine and catalog production.\n\n\n"}

Traditionally, winemakers would \"reserve\" some of their best wine rather than sell it immediately, coining the term.\n\nIn some countries the use of the term \"reserve\", \"\"reserva\" or \"riserva\"\" is regulated, but in many places it is not. Sometimes, reserve wine originates from the best vineyards, or the best barrels, making it more special. Additionally, reserve wines may be made in a style suited to longer aging periods. However, in regions where the use is not regulated the presence of the term \"reserve\" on a wine label may be nothing but a marketing strategy. Indeed, in the case of one of the largest-selling premium wines, Kendall-Jackson Chardonnay, every bottle produced is \"Vintner's Reserve\". To indicate a traditional reserve wine, Kendall-Jackson uses the term \"Grand Reserve\".\n\nLike the term \"old vines\", \"reserve\" traditionally indicates a wine that is special, or at least different in flavor or aging potential. The presence of a non-reserve bottling with a producer that also sells reserve wine makes it more likely that \"reserve\" is being used in its traditional sense. Partly because of the often vague meaning of \"reserve\", many wineries produce named cuvées instead. Typically these are reserve wines in the traditional meaning of the word.\n\nIn Portugal and Spain, reserva is a regulated term controlled by law, at least ensuring that reserve wines get some additional ageing. In practice it is very difficult to regulate quality, so the term primarily deals with ageing and alcoholic strength. In Portuguese and Spanish wines, the requirements varies between regions, but typically, when used on a label \"Reserva\" means that the wine was aged for at least three years in the cask and bottle, at least one of which must have been in the cask.\n\nThose that have been aged for five years (two in cask, three in bottle) or more are labelled . Gran Reservas are intended to be made only in exceptional vintages, but this is up to the producer.\n\nIn Portugal the term indicates that the wine has an alcohol level of at least 0.5 percent above the regional minimum, and that it was made from a rated vintage.\n\nIn the production of \"non-vintage\" Champagne, a certain amount of aged still wine is used for blending with still wine of the youngest vintage, before this blended base wine undergoes second fermentation in bottle to become sparkling Champagne. This aged still wine is called reserve wine, and this practice is meant to ensure that a certain Champagne house's non-vintage product has a consistent style over the years. Since the reserve wine is used in the production process, it is never bottled and sold as it is, but the proportion and age of the reserve wine is often seen as one of the indicators of the quality of a Champagne and the producer's level of ambition.\n\nIn the Austrian Districtus Austriae Controllatus (DAC) system, most DACs have an additional \"Reserve\" designation for a wine which has slightly more strict requirements.\n\nBefore the 1971 German wine law, a term corresponding to reserve wine existed in \"kabinett\", sometimes written as \"Kabinettwein\". In 1971, the similar-sounding term \"Kabinett\" was instead introduced as the lowest level of the \"Prädikatswein\" category, i.e., with a completely different meaning. Therefore, in the present German wine classification no legally defined term corresponding to reserve wine exists.\n\n"}

The rabbet allows the boards to overlap in this area. The profile of each board partially overlaps that of the board next to it creating a channel that gives shadow line effects, provides excellent weather protection and allows for dimensional movement.\n\nUseful for its strength as a supporting member, and its ability to form a relatively tight seal when lapped, shiplap is usually used as a type of siding for buildings that do not require extensive maintenance and must withstand cold and aggressive climates. Rough-sawn shiplap is attached vertically in post and beam construction, usually with 6d-8d common nails, while milled versions, providing a tighter seal, are more commonly placed horizontally, more suited to two-by-four frame construction.\n\nSmall doors and shutters such as those found in barns and sheds are often constructed of shiplap cut directly from the walls, with only thin members framing or crossing the back for support.

Teachers and parents alike can benefit from use of teachable moments.\n\nIn July 2009, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates was arrested at his home; the incident garnered media attention throughout the United States. The mayor of Cambridge, E. Denise Simmons, said that she hoped that the result would be a \"teachable moment\". U.S. President Barack Obama expressed the same hope as Simmons:\n\nObama's use of the phrase attracted considerable comment in the American media and blogosphere. Gates himself echoed the same theme, stating, \"I told the President that my entire career as an educator has been devoted to racial healing and improved race relations in this country. I am determined that this be a teaching moment.\"\n\nOn July 4, 2011, Professor Glyn Davis, vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, used the term in an article in Campus Review, describing the Australian Higher Education Base Funding Review as a rare opportunity to educate a wider public about how public tertiary education is supported. Davis argued that Australian Universities must show why Australia's public universities returned to the community the money spent providing higher education, and that this constituted a teachable moment.\n\nA teachable moment is often best demonstrated with a significant emotional or traumatic event, the emphasis being on the 'moment' versus the lesson. An example would be, after a high-speed motor vehicle accident, when the use of a seat belt has obviously saved a life, or conversely, when the lack of a seat belt has caused loss of life.\n\nLaw enforcement and first responders are often taught and encouraged to use appropriate situations to 'teach' the public.\n\nTeachable moments are not limited to episodes following error or miscreancy, where vulnerability opens the learner to teaching. There is also much work on the mechanisms and psychology by which teachable moments are created in relationships.\n\nRecent work by developmental psychologists Gyorgy Gergely and Gergely Csibra that has been picked up by other psychologists and psychotherapists, especially Peter Fonagy and Elizabeth Allison, describes a \"natural pedagogical stance\": this is accessed only when \"epistemic trust\" is created in the \"learner\", and epistemic trust is created when the learner experiences (\"recognises\") his or her own mind in that \"teachable moment\" as having been accepted and understood by the \"teacher\". This is what triggers curiosity in the contents of the understanding mind of the teacher, and a readiness to \"generalise\" the information taken in from the teacher to other contexts and people. Some impressive experimental evidence supports this theory. They argue that this learning pathway is almost entirely human-specific, requiring as it does the linked psychological function of mentalization to have occurred.\n\nThe logical corollary of this line of thinking is that in creating the \"teachable moment\" the \"teacher's\" first job is not to consider how to change the learner's mind, but \"how to change his or her own mind\", in order to better represent that mind of the learner \"as it is now\", and create conditions (through utterances, facial expression and other cues) in which it can be recognised by the learner.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "797617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=797617", "title": "Universal pragmatics", "text": "Universal pragmatics\n\nUniversal pragmatics (UP), more recently placed under the heading of formal pragmatics, is the philosophical study of the necessary conditions for reaching an understanding through communication. The philosopher Jürgen Habermas coined the term in his essay \"What is Universal Pragmatics?\" where he suggests that human competition, conflict, and strategic action are attempts to achieve understanding that have failed because of modal confusions. The implication is that coming to terms with how people understand or misunderstand one another could lead to a reduction of social conflict.\n\nBy coming to an \"understanding,\" he means at the very least, when two or more social actors share the same meanings about certain words or phrases; and at the very most, when these actors are confident that those meanings fit relevant social expectations (or a \"mutually recognized normative background\").\n\nFor Habermas, the goal of coming to an understanding is \"intersubjective mutuality ... shared knowledge, mutual trust, and accord with one another\". In other words, the underlying goal of coming to an understanding would help to foster the enlightenment, consensus, and good will necessary for establishing socially beneficial norms. Habermas' goal is not primarily for subjective feeling alone, but for development of shared (intersubjective) norms which in turn establish the social coordination needed for practical action in pursuit of shared and individual objectives (a form of action termed \"communicative action\").\n\nAs an interdisciplinary subject, universal pragmatics draws upon material from a large number of fields, from pragmatics, semantics, semiotics, informal logic, and the philosophy of language, through social philosophy, sociology, and symbolic interactionism, to ethics, especially discourse ethics, and on to epistemology and the philosophy of mind.\n\nUniversal pragmatics (UP) seeks to overcome three dichotomies: the dichotomy between \"body and mind\", between \"theory and practice\", and between \"analytic and continental philosophy\". It is part of a larger project to rethink the relationship between philosophy and the individual sciences during a period of social crisis. The project is within the tradition of Critical Theory, a program that traces back to the work of Max Horkheimer.\n\nThe term \"universal pragmatics\" includes two different traditions that Habermas and his collaborator, colleague, and friend Karl-Otto Apel have attempted to reconcile. On the one hand, ideas are drawn from the tradition of Plato, Aristotle, and Kant, wherein words and concepts are regarded as universally valid idealizations of shared meanings. And, on the other hand, inspiration is drawn from the American Pragmatist tradition (feat. Charles Sanders Peirce, George Herbert Mead, Charles W. Morris), for whom words are usually arbitrary signs devoid of intrinsic meaning, and whose function is to denote the things and processes in the objective world that surrounds the speakers. \n\nUP shares with speech act theory, semiotics, and linguistics an interest in the details of language use and communicative action. However, unlike those fields, it insists on a difference between the linguistic data that we \"observe\" in the 'analytic' mode, and the \"rational reconstruction of the rules of symbol systems\" that each reader/listener possesses intuitively when interpreting strings of words. In this sense, it is an examination of the two ways that language usage can be analyzed: as an object of scientific investigation, and as a 'rational reconstruction' of intuitive linguistic 'know-how'.\n\nUniversal pragmatics is associated with the philosophical method of \"rational reconstruction\".\n\nThe basic concern in universal pragmatics is \"utterances\" (or \"speech acts\") in general. This is in contrast to most other fields of linguistics, which tend to be more specialized, focusing exclusively on very specific sorts of utterances such as \"sentences\" (which in turn are made up of \"words\", \"morphemes\", and \"phonemes\").\n\nFor Habermas, the most significant difference between a sentence and an utterance is in that sentences are judged according to how well they make sense \"grammatically\", while utterances are judged according to their \"communicative validity\" (see section 1). (1979:31)\n\nUniversal pragmatics is also distinct from the field of sociolinguistics, because universal pragmatics is only interested in the meanings of utterances \"if they have to do with claims about truth or rightness\", while sociolinguistics is interested in all utterances in their social contexts. (1979:31, 33)\n\nThere are three ways to evaluate an utterance, according to UP. There are \"theories that deal with elementary propositions\", \"theories of first-person sentences\", and \"theories of speech acts\".\n\nA theory of elementary propositions investigates those things in the real world that are being \"referenced\" by an utterance, and the things that are implied by an utterance, or \"predicate\" it. For example, the utterance \"The first Prime Minister of Canada\" refers to a man who went by the name of Sir John A. Macdonald. And when a speaker delivers the utterance, \"My husband is a lawyer\", it implies that the speaker is married to a man.\n\nA theory of first-person sentences examines the expression of the \"intentions\" of the actor(s) through language and in the first-person.\n\nFinally, a theory of speech acts examines the setting of standards for interpersonal relations through language. The basic goal for speech act theory is to explain how and when utterances in general are \"performative\". (1979:34) Central to the notion of speech acts are the ideas of illocutionary force and perlocutionary force, both terms coined by philosopher J.L. Austin. \"Illocutionary force\" describes the intent of the speaker, while \"perlocutionary force\" means \"the effect an utterance has in the world\", or more specifically, the effect on others.\n\nA performative utterance is a sentence where an action being performed is done by the utterance itself. For example: \"I inform you that you have a moustache\", or \"I promise you I will not burn down the house\". In these cases, the words are also taken as significant actions: the act of informing and promising (respectively).\n\nHabermas adds to this the observation that speech acts can either succeed or fail, depending on whether or not they succeed on \"influencing\" another person in the intended way. (1979:35)\n\nThis last method of evaluation—the theory of speech acts—is the domain that Habermas is most interested in developing as a \"theory of communicative action\".\n\nThere are a number of ways to approach Habermas's project of developing a formal pragmatic analysis of communication. Because Habermas developed it in order to have a normative and philosophical foundation for his critical social theory, most of the inroads into formal pragmatics start from sociology, specifically with what is called action theory. Action theory concerns the nature of human action, especially the manner in which collective actions are coordinated in a functioning society.\n\nThe coordination and integration of social action has been explained in many ways by many theories. Rational choice theory and game theory are two examples, which describe the integration of individuals into social groups by detailing the complex manner in which individuals motivated only by self-interest will form mutually beneficial and cooperative social arrangements. In contrast to these, Habermas has formulated a theory of \"communicative action\". (Habermas 1984; 1987) This theory and the project of developing a formal pragmatic analysis of communication are inseparable.\n\nHabermas makes a series of distinctions in the service of explaining social action. The first major differentiation he makes is between two social realms, \"the system\" and \"the lifeworld\". These designate two distinct modes of social integration:\n\nThus, communicative action is an indispensable facet of society. It is at the heart of the lifeworld and is, Habermas claims, responsible for accomplishing several fundamental social functions: reaching understanding, cultural reproduction, coordinating action-plans, and socializing individuals.\n\nHowever, Habermas is quick to note, different modes of interaction can (in some ways) facilitate these social functions and achieve integration within the lifeworld. This points towards the second key distinction Habermas makes, which differentiates \"communicative action\" from \"strategic action\". The coordination of action plans, which constitutes the social integration of the lifeworld, can be accomplished either through consensus or influence.\n\nStrategic action is action oriented towards success, while communicative action is action oriented towards understanding. Both involve the symbolic resources of the lifeworld and occur primarily by way of linguistic interaction. On the one hand, actors employing communicative actions draw on the uniquely impelling force of mutual understanding to align the orientation of their action plans. It is this subtle but insistent binding force of communicative interactions that opens the door to an understanding of their meanings. On the other hand, actors employing strategic actions do not exploit the potential of communication that resides in the mutual recognition of a shared action-oriented understanding. Instead strategic actors relate to others with no intention of reaching consensus or mutual understanding, but only the intention of accomplishing pre-determined ends unrelated to reaching an understanding. Strategic action often involves the use of communicative actions to achieve the isolated intentions of individuals, manipulating shared understanding in the service of private interests. Thus, Habermas claims, strategic action is parasitic on communicative action, which means communicative action is the primary mode of linguistic interaction. Reaching a reciprocally defined understanding is communication's basic function.\n\nKeeping in mind this delineation of the object domain, the formal pragmatics of communication can be more readily laid out. The essential insight has already been mentioned, which is that communication is responsible for irreplaceable modes of social integration, and this is accomplished through the unique binding force of a shared understanding. This is, in a sense, the pragmatic piece of formal pragmatics: communication does something in the world. What needs to be explained are the conditions for the possibility of what communication already does. This is, in a sense, the formal piece of formal pragmatics: a rational reconstruction of the deep generative structures that are the universal conditions for the possibility of a binding and compelling mutual understanding.\n\nFrom here, Habermas heads the analysis in two directions. In one direction is a kind of linguistic analysis (of speech acts), which can be placed under the heading of the validity dimensions of communication. The other direction entails a categorization of the idealized presuppositions of communication.\n\nHabermas argues that when speakers are communicating successfully, they will have to defend their meaning by using these four claims.\n\n\nHabermas is emphatic that these claims are universal—no human communication oriented at achieving mutual understanding could possibly fail to raise all of these validity claims. Additionally, to illustrate that all other forms of communication are derived from that which is oriented toward mutual understanding, he argues that there are no other kinds of validity claims whatsoever. This is important, because it is the basis of Habermas' critique of postmodernism.\n\nThe fundamental orientation toward mutual understanding is at the heart of universal pragmatics, as Habermas explains:\n\"The task of universal pragmatics is to identify and reconstruct universal conditions of possible mutual understanding... other forms of social action—for example, conflict, competition, strategic action in general—are derivatives of action oriented toward reaching understanding. Furthermore, since language is the specific medium of reaching understanding at the sociocultural stage of evolution, I want to go a step further and single out explicit speech actions from other forms of communicative action.\"\n\nAny meaning that meets the above criteria, and is recognized by another as meeting the criteria, is considered \"vindicated\" or \"communicatively competent\".\n\nIn order for anyone to speak validly — and therefore, to have his or her comments vindicated, and therefore reach a genuine consensus and understanding — Habermas notes that a few more fundamental commitments are required. First, he notes, actors \"have to treat this formulation of validity so seriously that it might be a precondition for any communication at all\". Second, he asserts that \"all actors must believe that their claims are able to meet these standards of validity\". And third, he insists that there must be a common conviction among actors that all validity claims \"are either already vindicated or could be vindicated\".\n\nHabermas claims that communication rests upon a non-egoistic understanding of the world, which is an idea he borrowed from thinkers like Jean Piaget. A subject capable of a de-centered understanding can take up three fundamentally different attitudes to the world. Habermas refers to such attitudes as \"dimensions of validity\". Specifically, this means individuals can recognize different standards for validity—i.e., that the validation of an empirical truth claim requires different methods and procedures than the validation of subjective truthfulness, and that both of those require different methods and procedures of validation than claims to normative rightness.\n\nThese dimensions of validity can be summarized as claims to \"truth (IT), truthfulness (I),\" and \"rightness (WE)\". So the ability to differentiate between the attitudes (and their respective \"worlds\") mentioned above should be understood as an ability to distinguish between types of validity claims.\n\nM. Cooke provided the only book length treatment of Habermas's communication theory. Cooke explains:\n\nThis is fundamental to Habermas's analysis of communication. He maintains that the performance of any speech act necessarily makes reference to these dimensions of validity, by raising at least three validity claims.\n\nOne way to grasp this idea is to take an inventory of the ways in which an attempt at communication can misfire, the ways a speech act can fail. A hearer may reject the offering of a speech act on the grounds that it is invalid because it:\n\nOf course, from this it follows that a hearer who accepts the offering of a speech act does so on the grounds that it is valid because it:\n\nThis means that when engaging in communication the speaker and hearer are inescapably oriented to the validity of what is said. A speech act can be understood as an offering, the success or failure of which depends upon the hearer's response of either accepting or rejecting the validity claims it raises. The three dimensions of validity pointed out above are implicated in any attempt at communication.\n\nThus, communication relies on its being embedded within relations to various dimensions of validity. Any and every speech act is infused with inter-subjectively recognized claims to be valid. This implicitly ties communication to argumentation and various discursive procedures for the redemption of validity claims. This is true because to raise a validity claim in communication is to simultaneously imply that one is able to show, if challenged, that one's claim is justified. Communication is possible because speakers are accountable for the validity of what they say. This assumption of responsibility on the part of the speaker is described by Habermas as a \"warranty\", because in most cases the validity claims raised during communication are taken as justified, and communication proceeds on that basis. Similarly, the hearer is accountable for the stance he or she takes up in relation to the validity claims raised by the speaker. Both speaker and hearer are bound to the validity claims raised by the utterances they share during communication. They are bound by the weak obligations inherent in pursuing actions oriented towards reaching an understanding. Habermas would claim that this obligation is a rational one:\n\nThis begins to point towards the idea of communicative rationality, which is the potential for rationality that is implicit in the validity basis of everyday communication, the shape of reason that can be extracted from Habermas's formal-pragmatic analyses.\n\nHowever, before the idea of communicative rationality can be described, the other direction of Habermas's formal pragmatic analyses of communication needs to be explained. This direction looks towards the idealized presuppositions of communication.\n\nWhen individuals pursue actions oriented towards reaching an understanding, the speech acts they exchange take on the weight of a mutually recognized validity. This means each actor involved in communication takes the other as accountable for what they have said, which implies that good reasons could be given by all to justify the validity of the understanding that is being achieved. Again, in most situations the redemption of validity claims is not an explicit undertaking (except in \"discourses\", see below). Instead, each actor issues a \"warranty\" of accountability to the other, which only needs to be redeemed if certain validity claims are thrown into question. This suggests that the validity claims raised in every communicative interaction implicitly tie communication to argumentation.\n\nIt is here that the idealized presuppositions of communication arise. Habermas claims that all forms of argumentation, even implicit and rudimentary ones, rest upon certain \"idealizing suppositions,\" which are rooted in the very structures of action oriented towards understanding. These \"strong idealizations\" are always understood as at least approximately satisfied by participants in situations where argumentation (and communication) is thought to be taking place. Thus, when during communication it is discovered that the belief that these presuppositions are satisfied is not justified it is always taken as problematic. As a result, steps are usually taken to reestablish and maintain the belief that they are approximately satisfied, or communication is simply called off.\n\n\nIn sum, all these presuppositions must be assumed to be approximately satisfied in any situation of communication, despite their being necessarily counterfactual. Habermas refers to the positing of these idealized presuppositions as the \"simultaneously unavoidable and trivial accomplishments that sustain communicative action and argumentation\".\n\nHabermas calls \"discourses\" those forms of communication that come sufficiently close to actually satisfying these presuppositions. Discourses often occur within institutionalized forms of argumentation that self-reflectively refine their procedures of communication, and as a result, have a more rigorous set of presuppositions in addition to the ones listed above.\n\nA striking feature of discourse is that validity claims tend to be explicitly thematized and there is the presupposition that all possible interlocutors would agree to the universal validity of the conclusions reached. Habermas especially highlights this in what he calls \"theoretical discourses\" and \"practical discourses\". These are tied directly to two of the three dimensions of validity discussed above: theoretical discourse being concerned with validity claims thematized regarding objective states of affairs (IT); practical discourse being concerned with validity claims thematized concerning the rightness of norms governing social interactions (WE).\n\nHabermas understands presupposition (5) to be responsible for generating the self-understanding and continuation of theoretical and practical discourses. Presupposition (5) points out that the validity of an understanding reached in theoretical or practical discourse, concerning some factual knowledge or normative principle, is always expanded beyond the immediate context in which it is achieved. The idea is that participants in discourses such as these presuppose that any understanding reached could attain universal agreement concerning its universal validity if these discourses could be relieved of the constraints of time and space. This idealized presupposition directs discourses concerning truth and normative certainty beyond the contingencies of specific communicative situations and towards the idealized achievements of universal consensus and universal validity. It is a rational reconstruction of the conditions for the possibility of earnest discourses concerning facts and norms. Recall that, for Habermas, rational reconstructions aim at offering the most acceptable account of what allows for the competencies already mastered by a wide range of subjects. In order for discourse to proceed, the existence of facts and norms must be presupposed, yet the certainty of an absolute knowledge of them must be, in a sense, postponed.\n\nStriking a Piagetian and Peircean chord, Habermas understands the deep structures of collective inquiry as developmental. Thus, the presupposition shared by individuals involved in discourse is taken to reflect this. The pursuit of truth and normative certainty is taken to be motivated and grounded, not in some objective or social world that is treated as a \"given\", but rather in a learning process. Indeed, Habermas himself is always careful to formulate his work as a research project, open to refinement.\n\nIn any case, reconstructing the presuppositions and validity dimensions inherent to communication is valuable because it brings into relief the inescapable foundations of everyday practices. Communicative action and the rudimentary forms of argumentation that orient the greater part of human interaction cannot be left behind. By reconstructing the deep structures of these Habermas has discovered a seed of rationality planted in the very heart of the lifeworld. Everyday practices, which are common enough to be trivial, such as reaching an understanding with another, or contesting the reasons for pursuing a course of action, contain an implicit and idealized rationality.\n\nIn other words, communication is always somewhat rational. Communication could not occur if the participants thought that the speech acts exchanged did not carry the weight of a validity for which those participating could be held accountable. Nor would anyone feel that a conclusion was justified if it was achieved by any other means than the uncoerced force of the better argument. Nor could the specialized discourses of law, science and morality continue if the progress of knowledge and insight was denied in favor of relativism.\n\nIt is a question how appropriate it is to speak of \"communication\" tenselessly, and of \"everyday practices\" as though they cut across all times and cultures. That they do cannot be assumed, and anthropology provides evidence of significant difference. It is possible to ignore these facts by limiting the scope of universal pragmatics to current forms of discourse, but this runs the risk of contradicting Habermas's own demand for (5). Moreover, the initial unease with the classical and liberal views of rationality had to do precisely with their ahistorical character and refusal, or perhaps inability, to acknowledge their own origins in circumstances of the day. Their veneer of false universality torn off by the likes of Foucault, it remains to be seen whether \"universal\" pragmatics can stand up to the same challenges posed by deconstruction and skepticism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33110", "title": "Wilhelm von Humboldt", "text": "Wilhelm von Humboldt\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Christian Karl Ferdinand von Humboldt (; ; 22 June 1767 – 8 April 1835) was a Prussian philosopher, linguist, government functionary, diplomat, and founder of the Humboldt University of Berlin, which was named after him in 1949 (and also after his younger brother, Alexander von Humboldt, a naturalist).\n\nHe is especially remembered as a linguist who made important contributions to the philosophy of language, ethnolinguistics and to the theory and practice of education. In particular, he is widely recognized as having been the architect of the Humboldtian education ideal, which was used from the beginning in Prussia as a model for its system of education and eventually in countries such as the US and Japan.\n\nHis younger brother, Alexander von Humboldt, was famous as a geographer, naturalist, and explorer.\n\nHumboldt was born in Potsdam, Margraviate of Brandenburg, and died in Tegel, Province of Brandenburg.\n\nIn June 1791, he married Caroline von Dacheröden. They had eight children, of whom five (one of them Gabriele von Humboldt) survived to adulthood.\n\nHumboldt was a philosopher; he wrote \"The Limits of State Action\" in 1791–1792 (though it was not published until 1850, after Humboldt's death), one of the boldest defences of the liberties of the Enlightenment. It influenced John Stuart Mill's essay \"On Liberty\" through which von Humboldt's ideas became known in the English-speaking world. Humboldt outlined an early version of what Mill would later call the \"harm principle\". His house in Rome became a cultural hub, run by Caroline von Humboldt.\n\nThe section dealing with education was published in the December 1792 issue of the \"Berlinische Monatsschrift\" under the title \"On public state education\". With this publication, Humboldt took part in the philosophical debate regarding the direction of national education that was in progress in Germany, as elsewhere, after the French Revolution.\n\nHumboldt had been home schooled and never finished his comparably short university studies at the universities of Frankfurt (Oder) and Göttingen. Nevertheless, he became one of the most influential officials in German education. Actually, Humboldt had intended to become Minister of education, but failed to attain that position. The Prussian King asked him to leave Rome in 1809 and to lead the directorate of education under Friedrich Ferdinand Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten. Humboldt did not reply to the appointment for several weeks and would have preferred to stay on at the embassy in Rome. His wife did not return with him to Prussia; the couple met again when Humboldt stepped down from the educational post and was appointed head of the Embassy in Vienna.\n\nHumboldt installed a standardized system of public instruction, from basic schools till secondary education, and founded Berlin University. He imposed a standardization of state examinations and inspections and created a special department within the ministry to oversee and design curricula, textbooks and learning aids.\n\nHumboldt's plans for reforming the Prussian school system were not published until long after his death, together with his fragment of a treatise on the 'Theory of Human Education', which he had written in about 1793. Here, Humboldt states that 'the ultimate task of our existence is to give the fullest possible content to the concept of humanity in our own person […] through the impact of actions in our own lives.' This task 'can only be implemented through the links established between ourselves as individuals and the world around us' (GS, I, p. 283).\n\nHumboldt's concept of education does not lend itself solely to individualistic interpretation. It is true that he always recognized the importance of the organization of individual life and the 'development of a wealth of individual forms' (GS, III, p. 358), but he stressed the fact that 'self-education can only be continued […] in the wider context of development of the world' (GS, VII, p. 33). In other words, the individual is not only entitled, but also obliged, to play his part in shaping the world around him.\n\nHumboldt's educational ideal was entirely coloured by social considerations. He never believed that the 'human race could culminate in the attainment of a general perfection conceived in abstract terms'. In 1789, he wrote in his diary that 'the education of the individual requires his incorporation into society and involves his links with society at large' (GS, XIV, p. 155). In his essay on the 'Theory of Human Education', he answered the question as to the 'demands which must be made of a nation, of an age and of the human race'. 'Education, truth and virtue' must be disseminated to such an extent that the 'concept of mankind' takes on a great and dignified form in each individual (GS, I, p. 284). However, this shall be achieved personally by each individual, who must 'absorb the great mass of material offered to him by the world around him and by his inner existence, using all the possibilities of his receptiveness; he must then reshape that material with all the energies of his own activity and appropriate it to himself so as to create an interaction between his own personality and nature in a most general, active and harmonious form' (GS, II, p. 117).\n\nHumboldt educational model goes beyond vocational training. In a letter to the Prussian king, he wrote: \"There are undeniably certain kinds of knowledge that must be of a general nature and, more importantly, a certain cultivation of the mind and character that nobody can afford to be without. People obviously cannot be good craftworkers, merchants, soldiers or businessmen unless, regardless of their occupation, they are good, upstanding and – according to their condition – well-informed human beings and citizens. If this basis is laid through schooling, vocational skills are easily acquired later on, and a person is always free to move from one occupation to another, as so often happens in life.\" The philosopher Julian Nida-Rümelin criticized discrepancies between Humboldt's ideals and the contemporary European education policy, which narrowly understands education as a preparation for the labor market, and argued that we need to decide between McKinsey and Humboldt.\n\nAs a successful diplomat between 1802 and 1819, Humboldt was plenipotentiary Prussian minister at Rome from 1802, ambassador at Vienna from 1812 during the closing struggles of the Napoleonic Wars, at the congress of Prague (1813) where he was instrumental in drawing Austria to ally with Prussia and Russia against France, a signer of the peace treaty at Paris and the treaty between Prussia and defeated Saxony (1815), at Frankfurt settling post-Napoleonic Germany, and at the congress at Aachen in 1818. However, the increasingly reactionary policy of the Prussian government made him give up political life in 1819; and from that time forward he devoted himself solely to literature and study.\n\nWilhelm von Humboldt was an adept linguist and studied the Basque language. He translated Pindar and Aeschylus into German.\n\nHumboldt's work as a philologist in Basque has had more extensive impact than his other work. His visit to the Basque country resulted in \"Researches into the Early Inhabitants of Spain by the help of the Basque language\" (1821). In this work, Humboldt endeavored to show by examining geographical placenames that at one time a race or races speaking dialects allied to modern Basque extended throughout Spain, southern France and the Balearic Islands; he identified these people with the \"Iberians\" of classical writers, and further surmised that they had been allied with the Berbers of northern Africa. Humboldt's pioneering work has been superseded in its details by modern linguistics and archaeology, but is sometimes still uncritically followed even today. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1820, and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822.\n\nHumboldt died while preparing his greatest work, on the ancient Kawi language of Java, but its introduction was published in 1836 as \"The Heterogeneity of Language and its Influence on the Intellectual Development of Mankind\". His essay on the philosophy of speech\n\n...first clearly laid down that the character and structure of a language expresses the inner life and knowledge of its speakers, and that languages must differ from one another in the same way and to the same degree as those who use them. Sounds do not become words until a meaning has been put into them, and this meaning embodies the thought of a community. What Humboldt terms the inner form of a language is just that mode of denoting the relations between the parts of a sentence which reflects the manner in which a particular body of men regards the world about them. It is the task of the morphology of speech to distinguish the various ways in which languages differ from each other as regards their inner form, and to classify and arrange them accordingly.\n\nHe is credited with being the first European linguist to identify human language as a rule-governed system, rather than just a collection of words and phrases paired with meanings. This idea is one of the foundations of Noam Chomsky's theory of language. Chomsky frequently quotes Humboldt's description of language as a system which \"makes infinite use of finite means\", meaning that an infinite number of sentences can be created using a finite number of grammatical rules. Humboldt scholar Tilman Borsche, however, notes profound differences between von Humboldt's view of language and Chomsky's.\n\nMore recently, Humboldt has also been credited as an originator of the linguistic relativity hypothesis (more commonly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), developed by linguists Edward Sapir or Benjamin Whorf a century later.\n\nThe reception of Humboldt's work remains problematic in English-speaking countries, despite the work of Langham Brown, Manchester and James W. Underhill (Humboldt, Worldview & Language, 2009), on account of his concept of what he called \"Weltansicht\", the linguistic worldview, with \"Weltanschauung\" being translated simply as 'worldview', a term associated with ideologies and cultural mindsets in both German and English. The centrality of distinction in understanding Humboldt's work was set out by one of the leading contemporary German Humboldt scholars, Jürgen Trabant, in his works in both German and French. Polish linguists at the Lublin School (see Jerzy Bartmiński), in their research of Humboldt, also stress this distinction between the worldviews of a personal or political kind and the worldview that is implicit in language as a conceptual system.\n\nHowever, little rigorous research in English has gone into exploring the relationship between the linguistic worldview and the transformation and maintenance of this worldview by individual speakers. One notable exception is the work of Underhill, who explores comparative linguistic studies in both \"Creating Worldviews: Language\", \"Ideology & Metaphor\" (2011) and in \"Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: Truth, Love, Hate & War\" (2012). In Underhill's work, a distinction is made between five forms of worldview: world-perceiving, world-conceiving, cultural mindset, personal world and perspective, in order to convey the distinctions Humboldt was concerned with preserving in his ethnolinguistics. Probably the best-known linguist working with a truly Humboldtian perspective writing in English today is Anna Wierzbicka, who has published a number of comparative works on semantic universals and conceptual distinctions in language.\n\nThe Rouen Ethnolinguistics Project, in France, published online a 7-hour series of lectures on Humboldt's thought on language, with the Berlin specialist Prof. Trabant.\n\nIn Charles Taylor's important summative work, \"The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity\", (Taylor, 2016) von Humboldt is given credit, along with Johann Georg Hamann and Johann Gottfried Herder, for inspiring Taylor's \"HHH\" approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
