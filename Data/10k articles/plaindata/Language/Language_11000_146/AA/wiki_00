{"id": "2067130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067130", "title": "Chinese Pidgin English", "text": "Chinese Pidgin English\n\nChinese Pidgin English (also called Chinese Coastal English or Pigeon English, ) is a pidgin language lexically based on English, but influenced by a Chinese substratum. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, there was also Chinese Pidgin English spoken in Cantonese-speaking portions of China. Chinese Pidgin English is heavily influenced by a number of varieties of Chinese with variants arising among different provinces (for example in Shanghai and Ningbo).\n\nA separate Chinese Pidgin English has sprung up in more recent decades in places such as Nauru.\n\nEnglish first arrived in China in the 1630s, when English traders arrived in South China. Chinese Pidgin English was spoken first in the areas of Macao and Guangzhou (City of Canton), later spreading north to Shanghai by the 1830s. \"Yangjing Bang English\" in Chinese (洋涇浜, or 洋泾浜) derives from the name of a former creek in Shanghai near the Bund where local workers communicated with English-speaking foreigners in pidgin (broken English); (Yangjing Bang has since been filled in and is now the eastern part of Yan'an Road, the main east-west artery of central Shanghai).\n\nHistorically, it was a modified form of English developed in the 17th century for use as a trade language or lingua franca between the English and the Chinese. Chinese Pidgin started in Guangzhou, China, after the English established their first trading port there in 1664. Pidgin English was developed by the English and adapted by the Chinese for business purposes. The term \"pidgin\" itself is believed by some etymologists to be a corruption of the pronunciation of the English word \"business\" by the Chinese. Chinese Pidgin continued in use until about the end of the 19th century, when Pidgin came to be looked upon by the Chinese as humiliating (because English speakers considered it ridiculous) and so preferred to learn standard English instead.\n\nChinese Pidgin English began to decline in the late 19th century as standard English began to be taught in the country's education system. \n\nChinese Pidgin English spread to regions beyond the Chinese Coast. Many attestations of the language being spoken come from writings of Western travelers in China. Among these are scattered reports of the pidgin being spoken farther inland, such as in Chungking (Chongqing) and Hankow (Hankou), and farther north, in Kyong Song and even Vladivostok. CPE was also taken beyond China: the large numbers of CPE speakers in Nauru influenced the shaping of Nauruan Pidgin English and there is evidence that it was also taken to Australia, where it altered due to the influence of Australian English and other pidgins. It is also reported to have been spoken in Singapore and Java. Kim (2008) says that there is debate among linguists, including Baker, Mühlhäusler, and himself, about whether or not CPE was taken to California by 19th century immigrants. Many features present in California Chinese Pidgin English overlap with features of CPE, but also overlap with many other pidgins. Furthermore, some diagnostic features of CPE are missing or different from California Chinese Pidgin English. On the other hand, because many migrants came from the Canton province in China, where CPE was relatively well-known, it is likely that many migrants to the United States from China had knowledge of the pidgin. At the very least, it is clear that California Chinese Pidgin English should be treated as a distinct variety from CPE as spoken in Coastal China, because it has morphological and syntactic features not found in CPE.\n\nRobert Hall (1944) gives the following phonemic inventory:\nNative speakers of English use this inventory. Because most lexical items in CPE are derived from English, native English speakers simply use the pronunciation familiar to them. For non-native English speakers, who were largely Cantonese speakers, [v, θ, ð, r, š, ž] are not present, because these sounds are not present in Cantonese.\n\nHall also describes a few morphophonemic alterations. Many verbs ending in consonants may optionally add a vowel, as in [tek(i)] 'to take' and [slip(a)] 'to sleep'. Words ending in [r] and [l], and sometimes [d], optionally omit the final consonant, as in [litə(l)] 'little' and [mo(r)] 'more'. Certain stems also frequently lose their final consonant when before certain suffixes, as in [hwat] 'what?' ([hwasajd] 'where?,' [hwatajm] 'when?,' [hwafœšan] 'how?'), [ðœt] 'that' (ðœsajd 'there'), awt 'out' (awsajd 'outside').\n\nBaker and Mühlhäusler point out that Hall's data was taken entirely from native speakers of English, several decades after CPE was widely used. For this reason, they are skeptical of the data presented. Nonetheless, their own presentation of phonology in CPE is largely the same as Hall's. They state that [s] and [š] were not phonemically contrastive for Cantonese speakers. Words ending in [f] in English often had an added [o] as in \"thiefo\". Aside from these additions, Baker and Mühlhäusler have few revisions to make to the phonological claims Hall made.\n\nThe majority of the words used in CPE are derived from English, with influences from Portuguese, Cantonese, Malay, and Hindi.\n\n\nConstructions in Chinese Pidgin English, both at the phrase level and sentence level, vary widely in taking English or Chinese structure. Generally speaking, pidgin languages have isolating morphology and so do not inflect nouns and verbs; CPE is no exception. Some morphological and syntactic phenomena, which frequently appear in linguistic literature, are listed below.\n\nPrior to 1800, pronouns conformed largely to British and American English paradigms. Over time, \"my\" came to be the only first person singular pronoun in CPE, replacing both \"I\" and \"me\". \"He\" was used for subject and non-subject referents alike (Baker and Mühlhäusler 1990: 104). Plural pronouns were expressed as in English by native English speakers; we have too little data from native Cantonese speakers to determine if they pluralized pronouns.\n\nIn CPE, once a noun has been explicitly stated, it does not need to be stated again in following sentences where that item would normally be found. This means that in a given sentence, the subject or object may be omitted. In the example below, \"very poor people\" is the subject for the following clauses, although they do not explicitly state it.\nThe omitted noun may also be loosely related to the predicate, rather than a subject or object. In the sentence below, meaning 'He won't sell at that price,' the omitted \"that pricee\" is neither a subject nor an object.\n\nA word derived from English \"have\" was the usual copula in CPE until 1930. It usually appears as \"hab\" or \"hap\". \"Belong\" is also used. After 1830 it became most common to omit the copula entirely.\n'Chinese men are real rogues but that's how it is, can't help it'\n\nThis lexical item seems to have been an influence of Cantonese grammar on CPE. Cantonese uses classifiers on nouns described by a number or demonstrative. The word \"piecee\" is used where Cantonese would expect a classifier. \"Chop\" is another classifier, used only in demonstrative constructions. Places where Cantonese does not use a classifier, as with the words for 'year' and 'dollar,' likewise do not have a classifier in CPE.\n'You will have to engage a lawyer'\n'What is the name of this tea?'\n\nCertain expressions from Chinese English Pidgin have made their way into colloquial English, a process called calque. The following is a list of English expressions which may have been influenced by Chinese.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "451033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=451033", "title": "Early Cyrillic alphabet", "text": "Early Cyrillic alphabet\n\nThe Early Cyrillic alphabet is a writing system that was developed during the late ninth century on the basis of the Greek alphabet for the Slavic peoples living near the Byzantine Empire in South East and Central Europe. The objective was to make it possible for them to have Christian service in their mother tongues, instead of in Greek, which they did not understand, and to bring them closer to the cultural influence of Christianity, the official religion of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nIt was developed in the Preslav Literary School in the capital city of the First Bulgarian Empire in order to write the Old Church Slavonic language. The modern Cyrillic script is still used primarily for some Slavic languages and for East European and Asian languages that were under Russian cultural influence during the 20th century. \n\nAmong some of the traditionally culturally influential countries using it are Bulgaria, Serbia, Russia, Ukraine.\n\nThe earliest form of manuscript Cyrillic, known as \"ustav,\" was based on Greek uncial script, augmented by ligatures and by letters from the Glagolitic alphabet for consonants not found in Greek.\n\nThe Glagolitic alphabet was created by the monk Saint Cyril, possibly with the aid of his brother Saint Methodius, around 863. It was an adaptation designed to link the language of their mother, who was of Slavic origin (славянка), and their father, who was the Greek military commander of Thessaloniki, the second most important city of the Byzantine Empire. Cyrillic, on the other hand, may have been a creation of Cyril's students (most notable of whom was Clement of Ohrid) in the 890s at the Preslav Literary School under Bulgarian Tsar Simeon the Great as a more suitable script for church books, though retaining the original Bulgarian symbols in Glagolitic. An alternative hypothesis proposes that it emerged in the border regions of Greek proselytization to the Slavs before it was codified and adapted by some systematizer among the Slavs; the oldest Cyrillic manuscripts look very similar to 9th and 10th century Greek uncial manuscripts, and the majority of uncial Cyrillic letters were identical to their Greek uncial counterparts. One possibility is that this systematization of Cyrillic was undertaken at the Council of Preslav in 893, when the Old Church Slavonic liturgy was adopted by the Bulgarian Empire.\n\nThe Cyrillic alphabet was very well suited for the writing of Old Church Slavic, generally following a principle of \"one letter for one significant sound\", with some arbitrary or phonotactically-based exceptions. Particularly, this principle is violated by certain vowel letters, which represent plus the vowel if they are not preceded by a consonant. It is also violated by a significant failure to distinguish between /ji/ and /jĭ/ orthographically. There was no distinction of capital and lowercase letters, though manuscript letters were rendered larger for emphasis, or in various decorative initial and nameplate forms. Letters served as numerals as well as phonetic signs; the values of the numerals were directly borrowed from their Greek-letter analogues. Letters without Greek equivalents mostly had no numeral values, whereas one letter, koppa, had only a numeric value with no phonetic value.\n\nSince its creation, the Cyrillic script has adapted to changes in spoken language and developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages. It has been the subject of academic reforms and political decrees. Variations of the Cyrillic script are used to write languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia.\n\nThe form of the Russian alphabet underwent a change when Tsar Peter the Great introduced the Civil Script (, or , ), in contrast to the prevailing Church Typeface, () in 1708. Some letters and breathing marks which were only used for historical reasons were dropped. Medieval letterforms used in typesetting were harmonized with Latin typesetting practices, exchanging medieval forms for Baroque ones, and skipping the western European Renaissance developments. The reform subsequently influenced Cyrillic orthographies for most other languages. Today, the early orthography and typesetting standards only remain in use in Church Slavonic.\n\nA comprehensive repertoire of early Cyrillic characters is included in the Unicode since version 5.1 standard, which published on April 4, 2008. These characters and their distinctive letterforms are represented in specialized computer fonts for Slavistics.\n\nIn addition to the basic letters, there were a number of scribal variations, combining ligatures, and regionalisms used, all of which varied over time.\n\nEach letter had a numeric value also, inherited from the corresponding Greek letter. A titlo over a sequence of letters indicated their use as a number; usually this was accompanied by a dot on either side of the letter. In numerals, the ones place was to the left of the tens place, the reverse of the order used in modern Arabic numerals. Thousands are formed using a special symbol, (U+0482), which was attached to the lower left corner of the numeral. Many fonts display this symbol incorrectly as being in line with the letters instead of subscripted below and to the left of them.\n\nTitlos were also used to form abbreviations, especially of nomina sacra; this was done by writing the first and last letter of the abbreviated word along with the word's grammatical endings, then placing a titlo above it. Later manuscripts made increasing use of a different style of abbreviation, in which some of the left-out letters were superscripted above the abbreviation and covered with a pokrytie diacritic.\n\nSeveral diacritics, adopted from Polytonic Greek orthography, were also used, but were seemingly redundant (these may not appear correctly in all web browsers; they are supposed to be directly above the letter, not off to its upper right):\n\nPunctuation systems in early Cyrillic manuscripts were primitive: there was no space between words and no upper and lower case, and punctuation marks were used inconsistently in all manuscripts.\n\nSome of these marks are also used in Glagolitic script.\n\nUsed only in modern texts\n\n\n\n"}

The complementary processinterpreting a message received from an addresseris called decoding.\n\nThe process of message exchanges, or semiosis, is a key characteristic of human life depending on rule-governed and learned codes that, for the most part, unconsciously guide the communication of meaning between individuals. These interpretive frameworks or linking grids were termed \"myths\" by Roland Barthes (1915–1980) and pervade all aspects of culture from personal conversation to the mass media's output (for code exchange through the mass media, see Americanism).\n\nEarly theorists like Saussure (1857–1913) proposed the theory that when the addresser wishes to transmit a message to an addressee, the intended meaning must be converted into content so that it can be delivered. Roman Jakobson (1896–1982) offered a structuralist theory that the transmission and response would not sustain an efficient discourse unless the parties used the same codes in the appropriate social contexts. But, Barthes shifted the emphasis from the \"semiotics of language\" to the exploration of \"semiotics as language\". Now, as Daniel Chandler states, there is no such thing as an uncoded message: all experience is coded. So when the addresser is planning the particular message, both denotative and connotative meanings will already be attached to the range of signifiers relevant to the message. Within the broad framework of syntactic and semantic codes, the addresser will select signifiers that, in the particular context, will best represent his or her values and purposes. But the medium of communication is not necessarily neutral and the ability of the addressee to accurately decode the message may be affected by a number of factors. So the addresser must attempt to compensate for the known problems when constructing the final version of the message and hope that the preferred meanings will be identified when the message is received. One of the techniques is to structure the message so that certain aspects are given salience (sometimes called \"foregrounding\") and predispose the audience to interpret the whole in the light of the particular. This relates to Gestalt psychology, Max Wertheimer (1880–1943) examined the factors that determine grouping in cognitive processes:\nIf an addresser is writing a speech, rhetorical tropes may be used to emphasise the elements that the audience is to focus upon and potentially perceive as predicating a particular conclusion. If images are to be selected, metonymy may indicate common associational values with the preferred meaning of the text.\n\n"}

The history monoid provides a set of synchronization primitives (such as locks, mutexes or thread joins) for providing rendezvous points between a set of independently executing processes or threads.\n\nHistory monoids occur in the theory of concurrent computation, and provide a low-level mathematical foundation for process calculi, such as CSP the language of communicating sequential processes, or CCS, the calculus of communicating systems. History monoids were first presented by M.W. Shields.\n\nHistory monoids are isomorphic to trace monoids (free partially commutative monoids) and to the monoid of dependency graphs. As such, they are free objects and are universal. The history monoid is a type of semi-abelian categorical product in the category of monoids.\n\nLet \n\ndenote an \"n\"-tuple of alphabets formula_2. Let formula_3 denote all possible combinations of finite-length strings from the alphabets:\n\n(In more formal language, formula_3 is the Cartesian product of the free monoids of the formula_2. The superscript star is the Kleene star.) Composition in the product monoid is component-wise, so that, for\n\nand\n\nthen\n\nfor all formula_10 in formula_3.

Given any string formula_13, we can pick out just the letters in some formula_14 using the corresponding string projection formula_15. A distribution formula_16 is the mapping that operates on formula_13 with all of the formula_18, separating it into components in each free monoid:\n\nFor every formula_20, the tuple formula_21 is called the elementary history of \"a\". It serves as an indicator function for the inclusion of a letter \"a\" in an alphabet formula_2. That is,\n\nwhere\n\nHere, formula_25 denotes the empty string. The history monoid formula_26 is the submonoid of the product monoid formula_3 generated by the elementary histories: formula_28 (where the superscript star is the Kleene star applied with a component-wise definition of composition as given above). The elements of formula_26 are called global histories, and the projections of a global history are called individual histories.\n\nThe use of the word \"history\" in this context, and the connection to concurrent computing, can be understood as follows. An individual history is a record of the sequence of states of a process (or thread or machine); the alphabet formula_2 is the set of states of the process.\n\nA letter that occurs in two or more alphabets serves as a synchronization primitive between the various individual histories. That is, if such a letter occurs in one individual history, it must also occur in another history, and serves to \"tie\" or \"rendezvous\" them together.\n\nConsider, for example, formula_31 and formula_32. The union alphabet is of course formula_33. The elementary histories are formula_34, formula_35, formula_36, formula_37 and formula_38. In this example, an individual history of the first process might be formula_39 while the individual history of the second machine might be formula_40. Both of these individual histories are represented by the global history formula_41, since the projection of this string onto the individual alphabets yields the individual histories. In the global history, the letter formula_42 can be considered to commute with the letters formula_43 and formula_44, in that these can be rearranged without changing the individual histories. Such commutation is simply a statement that the first and second processes are running concurrently, and are unordered with respect to each other; they have not (yet) exchanged any messages or performed any synchronization.\n\nThe letter formula_45 serves as a synchronization primitive, as its occurrence marks a spot in both the global and individual histories, that cannot be commuted across. Thus, while the letters formula_42 and formula_47 can be re-ordered past formula_43 and formula_44, they cannot be reordered past formula_45. Thus, the global history formula_51 and the global history formula_52 both have as individual histories formula_53 and formula_54, indicating that the execution of formula_43 may happen before or after formula_47. However, the letter formula_45 is synchronizing, so that formula_44 is guaranteed to happen after formula_47, even though formula_44 is in a different process than formula_47.\n\nThe history monoid is isomorphic to the trace monoid, and as such, is a type of semi-abelian categorical product in the category of monoids. In particular, the history monoid formula_62 is isomorphic to the trace monoid formula_63 with the dependency relation given by\n\nIn simple terms, this is just the formal statement of the informal discussion given above: the letters in an alphabet formula_2 can be commutatively re-ordered past the letters in an alphabet formula_66, unless they are letters that occur in both alphabets. Thus, traces are exactly global histories, and vice versa.\n\n"}

Writing the sociolinguistics of Hyam, Blench treats \"Sait,\" and \"Dzar\" as distinct varieties, and notes that \"Yat\" and \"Ankung\" may be viewed as separate languages, however, Hayab (2016) presents a differing opinion arguing that it is Ankung, a language called Iduya, that is not mutually intelligible to Hyam. Meanwhile, Hyam, which is spoken by the Ham people of Nigeria, popularly known as 'Jaba' in a recent study by Philip Hayab, a native of the area and a linguist who carried out in-depth research into the language, reveals that 'Jaba' has a Hausa etymology and is derogatory and should be discarded (John 2017).\n\nNative Hyam speakers are found mainly in Jaba, Kachia\nand Kagarko and also in Jema'a Local Government Areas of southern Kaduna state and in Keffi Local Government Area of Nasarawa state of Nigeria.\n\nJames (1998) classified the Hyam dialects according to the following sub-groups he placed under the Ham or Northern Group of the Proto-Plateau Ethno-Linguistic Cluster:\n\nAccording to Hayab (2016:5-11), however, the Ham, aside migratory past, a subject requiring keen study, could be said to speak the following:\nHayab (2016:6) added that other varieties may also include:\n\nFurther more, Hayab (2016:8) classified these dialects into four clusters, A-D, according to their levels of intelligibility.\n\nAgain note that Hyam is the language spoken by the Ham people people.\n\nThe Hyam Literacy Committee identifies the following 41/42 basic symbols in its orthography.\n\na a̱ b c d dz e e̱ f g gb gh h hw hyw i i̱ j k kh kp l m n ng ny o p r s sh t th thn ts u v w y yw z zh\n\nVOWELS\n\nShort Vowels (Vawella̱ Sha̱kuup)\n\na a̱ e e̱ i i̱ o u\n\nLong Vowels\n\naa ee ii oo uu\n\n(Khwikhwir Vawel)\n\nai au a̱u ou\n\nCONSONANTS\n\nb c d dh dz f g gy gb gh ghy h hw hwy hyw j k ky kh khy kp l m n nh ng ny p r s sh t th thn ts v w y yw z zh\n\nHayab (2016:66) pinpoints, stating that \"available data in Hyam by Koelle (1854: appendix, 2-188) and Meek (1931:120) reveals that the Ham contest in virtually a dissimilar way from what is obtained today.\" He added that it is apparent that the old counting system has been replaced with a Hausa styled one, and again states that \"at present, the old style with ten (which was \"kop\") now as ' shwak '. A case points is kop (ten) shows to be an incomplete number observing the evidence that ' mbwan shwak ' (11) suggests that we were a number away from \"shwak\" (twelve).\" He then added that \"this is because the word ' mbwan ' actually denotes \"bwat\" - short of or 'remaining'.\n\nThe above can be said to be true, considering the case of Tyap, a related language, where the present word for \"ten\" is \"swak\", while the word \"kop/kwop\" is almost extinct, just as in Hyam, and only used for counting in thousands. The word \"thousand\" in Tyap is \"cyi kop/kwop\", meaning (considering the old usage of the word \"kop/kwop\"), \"\"a hundred - ten times\" or \"100 X 10\"\".\n\nThese, according to Hayab (2016:66-67) are the numbers used at least 200 years ago for counting in Hyam.\n\n\nManuscript https://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/100914\n"}

The buoys were intended to replace lightships and were constructed as a circular hull with a central light to provide all-round visibility and a foghorn. They may also contain radio and radio beacons. The navigation buoy was to be monitored remotely from onshore and was designed to run for extended periods without repair. The running costs were estimated to be as little as 10% of those of a lightship.\n\nHowever, experience showed that it was difficult to attain the required reliability in British waters due to the high acceleration forces experienced in rough seas with 14m waves and 7 knot currents. Alternative experiments were made with platforms such as the Royal Sovereign Lighthouse. The automatic technology was later used successfully in more conventional lightships.\n\nA Lanby buoy replaced the Bar Lightship PLANET in the Mersey estuary in 1972 and remained in service for 21 years before being replaced itself.\n"}

He has written four novels i.e. 'Nakhlistan Ki Talash' (2004), 'EK Mamnua Muhabbat Ki Kahani'(2009) and 'Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi' (2011) and Rohzin. Rahman Abbas got National Award for his second novel 'EK Mamnua Muhabbat Ki Kahani' and Fiction Award for his third novel 'Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi'by Maharashtra State Urdu Sahitya Academy for year 2012. These novels have raised issues of cultural identity and existential problems of contemporary Indian Muslims. Rahman Abbas has done experiment of forms in 'Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi' whereas in two other novels he has dealt seriously with the issues of terrorism and different forms of terrorism in sub-continent context.\n\nZauqui's novel \"Le Sans Bhi Ahesta\" was based upon psychological trauma of children who were born soon after the partition of India and Pakistan. It is a well crafted novel. In last few years Rahman's novel'EK Mamnua Muhabbat Ki Kahani\" and Zauqui's novel 'Le Sans Bhi Ahesta' have been widely debated in literary magazines. Rahman's novel is a love story which also reflects how religious groups damage the composite culture of India in the name of culture of religion. On the other hand Rahma Abbas novel \"Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi\" is a novel about a man suffering from existential crisis who feels that he is held hostage by societal pressure and paradoxes. Noorul Hasian stated in his book \"Naya Afsana Naye Naam\" that both writers i.e. Zauqui and Rahman Abbas have broken conventional boundaries in search of new style and made their work readable.\n\nPaigham Afaqui's \"Paleeta\" (2011) was the second novel of the author of the novel \"Makaan\". The novel has received even more serious attention than Makaan which was published in 1989 and while Makaan is known as a modernist novel, Paleeta is being recognized as a post-modern-post colonial novel of significance.It is story of its central character Khalid 's death due to inhaling the agonies of the century as a poison and his resurrection in the form of an ever-growing book of consciousness published posthumously and making rage among public. The novel demonstrates not only a fresh approach to the historical reality of the century but also a technique of narrative that is unique.\n\nFarooqi's novel \"Kai Chand The Sar-e-Asman had also got attention when it was published in 2006. Later, author translated it into English and Hindi. However, in the contemporary Urdu fiction Farooqi's novel was being considered as a burdened by documentation and stuff borrowed from history.\n\nNoorul Hasnain, Tarannum Riyaz, Abbus Samad, Gazanfar, and Shaista Fakhari have also published their novels during this period. Norul Hasanain's novel 'Aiwano ke khabida Chirag', Shaista Fakhri's novel 'Nadida Baharon Ke Nishan' have also got attention of Urdu fiction readers. Gazanfar's novel \"Manjhi\" and Abdus Samad's novel 'Shikast Ki Awaz' have got reviews in literary magazine.\n\nNaeem Baig is a novelist and short story writer who has conceived novels and short stories(afsanas) in Urdu and English Languages.He is a former senior Banker & Engineering management Consultant.

{"id": "1455948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1455948", "title": "Maceration (wine)", "text": "Maceration (wine)\n\nMaceration is the winemaking process where the phenolic materials of the grape—tannins, coloring agents (anthocyanins) and flavor compounds—are leached from the grape skins, seeds and stems into the must. To macerate is to soften by soaking, and maceration is the process by which the red wine receives its red color, since raw grape juice (with the exceptions of teinturiers) is clear-grayish in color. In the production of white wines, maceration is either avoided or allowed only in very limited manner in the form of a short amount of skin contact with the juice prior to pressing. This is more common in the production of varietals with less natural flavor and body structure like Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. For Rosé, red wine grapes are allowed some maceration between the skins and must, but not to the extent of red wine production.\n\nWhile maceration is a technique usually associated with wine, it is used with other drinks, such as Lambic, piołunówka, Campari and crème de cassis, and also used to steep unflavored spirit with herbs for making herb-based alcohol like absinthe.\n\nThe process of maceration begins, to varying extent, as soon as the grapes' skins are broken and exposed to some degree of heat. Temperature is the guiding force, with higher temperatures encouraging more breakdown and extraction of phenols from the skins and other grape materials. Maceration continues during the fermentation period, and can last well past the point when the yeast has converted all sugars into alcohol. The process itself is a slow one with compounds such as the anthocyanins needing to pass through the cell membrane of the skins to come into contact with the wine. During fermentation, higher temperatures and higher alcohol levels can encourage this process with the alcohol acting as a solvent to assist in the breakdown of the organic compounds within the grape materials. This process seems to slow once the wine reaches an alcohol level of 10%.\n\nThroughout the fermentation process, carbon dioxide is released as a byproduct of the conversion of sugar into alcohol. The carbon dioxide seeks to escape from the must by rising to the top of the mixture, pushing the grape skins and other materials to the top as well. This forms what is known as a \"cap\" that is visible on top of the fermentation vessel. At this point, a very limited amount of the must comes into contact with the skins, and winemakers seek to correct this by pushing down the cap (either with equipment or the traditional method of treading with their feet) or by pumping wine out from under and over onto the cap. This process of \"pumping over\" or \"punching down\" the cap is done often throughout the fermentation process, depending on the extent of maceration the winemaker desires. An efficient and modern method of maceration is the \"pneumatage process\" in which compressed air or gas is sequentially injected into the juice. The bubbles created during the pneumatage process uses gravity and the weight of the juice to circulate the wine juice with the cap of skins and grape solids allowing for greater extraction of aroma, coloring agents and tannins to diffuse into the wine juice (\"must\").\n\nDepending on the varietal, the process of maceration can help bring out many flavors in the wine that would otherwise be lacking. It can enhance the body and mouthfeel for many wines, as well as strengthen the color. Greater extraction can add to the complexity and life expectancy of the wine by developing more complex tannins that will soften over a longer period of time. With these benefits does come the risk of developing various wine faults, such as the development of acetic (or \"volatile\") acidity. Too much extraction can also increase the harshness of some tannins to where the wine is not very approachable to most wine drinkers.\n\nOne classical method of maceration is grape stomping or \"pigeage\", where grapes are crushed in vats by barefoot workers.\n\nThe process of cold maceration or cold soak is where temperatures of the fermenting must are kept low to encourage extraction by water and added sulfur dioxide rather than relying principally on heat and alcohol to act as a solvent. This technique was popular in the production of Burgundy wines in the 1970s and 1980s but there is still some debate among oenologists about the overall benefits to and resulting quality of the wine.\n\nCarbonic maceration is the fermentation of whole clusters of unbroken grapes in an atmosphere saturated with carbon dioxide, which prevents traditional yeast fermentation. It is a process different from what is commonly referred to in winemaking as \"maceration\".\n"}

Noted for her excellent psychological novels, she is regarded—together with Ferdinand von Saar—as one of the most important German-language writers of the latter portion of the 19th century.\n\nShe was born at the castle of the Catholic Dubský (\"Dubský von Třebomyslice\") noble family in Zdislavice (present Czech Republic) near Kroměříž in Moravia, the daughter of Baron (from 1843: Count) Dubsky and his wife Maria, née Baroness Vockel, who came from a Protestant-Saxon background. Marie lost her mother in early infancy, but received a careful intellectual training from two stepmothers. Despite being part of a noble family having access to her family's vast libraries, she was never actually schooled properly. In 1848 she married her cousin, the Austrian captain, and subsequent field-marshal, . The couple resided first in Vienna, then at Louka (\"Klosterbruck\") near Znojmo, where her husband had a military charge, and after 1860 again in Vienna. The marriage was childless. Marie grappled with the domestic priorities of a woman. She kept a journal and wrote letters explaining how her life constantly felt interrupted because of these tasks. It has been speculated that Marie may have suffered from \"hysteria\" based on symptoms found throughout these entries including debilitating headaches and excessive nervousness.\n\nMarie began devoting herself to literary work. In her endeavours she received assistance and encouragement from Franz Grillparzer and Freiherr von Münch-Bellinghausen. Her first publicized work was the drama \"Maria Stuart in Scotland\" (), which Philipp Eduard Devrient produced at the Karlsruhe theatre in 1860. Then came a tragedy in five acts, \"Marie Roland\", with several one-act dramas: \"Doktor Ritter\", \"Violets\" (), and \"The Disconsolate One\".\n\nAfter these limited successes in the field of drama, she turned to narrative. Commencing with \"Die Prinzessin von Banalien\" (1872), she graphically depicts in \"Božena\" (Stuttgart, 1876, 4th ed. 1899) and \"Das Gemeindekind\" (Berlin, 1887, 4th ed. 1900) the surroundings of her Moravian home, and in \"Lotti, die Uhrmacherin\" (Berlin, 1883, 4th ed. 1900), \"Zwei Comtessen\" (Berlin, 1885, 5th ed. 1898), \"Unsühnbar\" (1890, 5th ed. 1900) and \"Glaubenslos?\" (1893) the life of the Austrian aristocracy in town and country.\n\nMuch of Ebner-Eschenbach's more mainstream success is accredited to Julius Rodenberg due to his publishing Ebner-Eschenbach's work in his popular periodical, Die Deutsche Rundschau.\nShe also published \"Neue Erzählungen\" (Berlin, 1881, 3rd ed. 1894), \"Aphorismen\" (Berlin, 1880, 4th ed. 1895) and \"Parabeln, Märchen und Gedichte\" (2nd ed., Berlin, 1892). Von Ebner-Eschenbach's elegance of style, her incisive wit and masterly depiction of character give her a foremost place among the German women writers of her time. On the occasion of her 70th birthday the university of Vienna conferred upon her the degree of doctor of philosophy, honoris causa. An edition of Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach's \"Gesammelte Schriften\" (Collected Works) began to appear in 1893 (Berlin).\n\nThroughout her life, she had never created literature or plays for monetary reasons, and so, in her will, she left, as to aid other writers in their own endeavors, the compensation she had received. She died in Vienna, Austria-Hungary.\n\n\n\n"}

The name Nightcore means \"we are the core of the night, so you'll dance all night long\", stated in their website named \"Nightcore is Hardcore\". The two were influenced by pitch-shifted vocals in German group Scooter's hardcore songs \"Nessaja\" and \"Ramp! (The Logical Song)\", stating in an interview that \"There were so few of these kinds of artists, we thought that mixing music in our style would be a pleasure for us to listen to\" and \"Nightcore has become a style of music, a way to make the music happier – 'happy hardcore' as they say.\"\n\nThe duo set a template of a track in the style: a 25% sped-up (commonly to around 160 to 180 beats per minute) of a trance or eurodance song. The nightcore music has been compared to happy hardcore and bubblegum bass due to its fast tempos, energetic feel and high-pitched vocals. Nightcore made five albums of sped-up versions of trance recordings, including their 2002 thirteen-track debut album \"Energized\" and their later albums \"Summer Edition 2002\", \"L'hiver\", \"Sensación\" and \"Caliente\". Their first album was made with eJay, while all of their later work was made with what they described as \"top secret\" programs. All of their records were sold to their friends and DJs around their area.\n\nNightcore's works started appearing on services such as LimeWire and YouTube around the mid-2005. The first nightcore track to appear on the latter site was \"Dam Dadi Doo\" by the duo in 2006. Only two of the project's albums have surfaced on the Internet. One of the first people to distribute nightcore music on YouTube was a user going by the name Maikel631, starting in 2008. He first uploaded around 30 original tracks by Nightcore on the website. In 2009, he found a \"new\" nightcore track and the technique to make material in the style: \n\nThe first nightcore edit of a non-dance track was that of a track by rock band Evanescence, uploaded on YouTube in 2011. From there, the music rose in popularity with more people applying the nightcore treatment to more non-dance genres such as pop music and hip-hop. Many of the pioneer uploaders of nightcore including Maikel631 have called these non-dance edits \"fake\". The nightcore scene then crossed over to Soundcloud with the help of artist lilangelboi, who had released around ten to fifteen edits on the service before being signed to Manicure Records. The head of Manicure, Tom \"Ghibli\" Mike, recalled, \"I just got totally obsessed with it. I put up that one he did, \"Light\", we had him up here to DJ a few parties, and then he moved here. That was totally how nightcore became a thing for us.\" The label's #MANICURED playlist consisted of nightcore renditions of K-pop and electro house tracks, a few of them also incorporating production techniques outside of pitch-shifting and speeding up the source material, such as \"Mile High\" by Chipped Nails and Ponibbi and \"Fave Hours\" by F I J I.\n\nBy the mid-2010s, the nightcore scene had garnered attention from musicians such as Djemba Djemba, Maxo and Harrison, Nina Las Vegas, Ryan Hemsworth, Lido, Moist Breezy, and PC Music founders Danny L Harle and A. G. Cook. Harle and Cook have claimed nightcore to be influences in interviews, the former saying in an interview, A THUMP writer described it as the \"most innovative club music today\" and wrote that it also led to a number of \"awful\" internet memes: \nDance Music Northwest described nightcore as \"too catchy, too danceable, and far too much fun to not welcome into the dance music mainstream.\" David Turner of MTV described a nightcore remix of \"7 Years\" by Lukas Graham as \"just the normal fucking song\" and plagiarism.\n"}

As such, it is usually located in the central business district of a town or city, and has the greatest density of transport links such as roads and rail. Other hallmarks indicating a PLVI are tall buildings (in order to maximise the use of land) and a relatively great number of pedestrians.\n\nThis model is the urban equivalent of von Thünen's rural land use model in that both are based upon locational rent. The main assumption is that in a free market the highest bidder will obtain the use of the land. The highest bidder is likely to be the one who can obtain the maximum profit from that site and so can pay the highest rent. Competition for land is keenest in the city centre.\n\nThe most expensive or 'prime' sites in most cities are in the CBD, mainly because of its accessibility and the shortage of space there. Shops, especially department stores, conduct their business using a relatively small amount of ground space, and due to their high rate of sales and turnover they can bid a high price for the land (for which they try to compensate by building upwards and by using the land intensively). The most valuable site within the CBD is called the peak Land value intersection or PLVI. Competing with retailers are offices, which also rely upon good transport systems and, traditionally, proximity to other commercial buildings (this concept does not have the same relevance in centrally planned economies).\n\nOne basis of this model is 'the more accessible the site, the higher its land value'. Rents will therefore be greater along main routes leading out of the city and along outer ring roads. Where two of these routes cross, there may be a secondary or subsidiary land value peak. Here the land use is likely to be a small suburban shopping parade or a small industrial estate.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26137572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26137572", "title": "Plant litter", "text": "Plant litter\n\nLitterfall, plant litter, leaf litter, tree litter, soil litter, or duff, is dead plant material (such as leaves, bark, needles, twigs, and cladodes) that have fallen to the ground. This detritus or dead organic material and its constituent nutrients are added to the top layer of soil, commonly known as the litter layer or O horizon (\"O\" for \"organic\"). Litter has occupied the attention of ecologists at length for the reasons that it is an instrumental factor in ecosystem dynamics, it is indicative of ecological productivity, and may be useful in predicting regional nutrient cycling and soil fertility.\n\nLitterfall is characterized as fresh, undecomposed, and easily recognizable (by species and type) plant debris. This can be anything from leaves, cones, needles, twigs, bark, seeds/nuts, logs, or reproductive organs (e.g. the stamen of flowering plants). Items larger than 2 cm diameter are referred to as coarse litter, while anything smaller is referred to as fine litter or litter. The type of litterfall is most directly affected by ecosystem type. \nFor example, leaf tissues account for about 70 percent of litterfall in forests, but woody litter tends to increase with forest age. In grasslands, there is very little aboveground perennial tissue so the annual litterfall is very low and quite nearly equal to the net primary production.\n\nIn soil science, soil litter is classified in three layers, which form on the surface of the O Horizon. These are the L, F, and H layers:\nThe litter layer is quite variable in its thickness, decomposition rate and nutrient content and is affected in part by seasonality, plant species, climate, soil fertility, elevation, and latitude. The most extreme variability of litterfall is seen as a function of seasonality; each individual species of plant has seasonal losses of certain parts of its body, which can be determined by the collection and classification of plant litterfall throughout the year, and in turn affects the thickness of the litter layer. In tropical environments, the largest amount of debris falls in the latter part of dry seasons and early during wet season. As a result of this variability due to seasons, the decomposition rate for any given area will also be variable.\nLatitude also has a strong effect on litterfall rates and thickness. Specifically, litterfall declines with increasing latitude. In tropical rainforests, there is a thin litter layer due to the rapid decomposition, while in boreal forests, the rate of decomposition is slower and leads to the accumulation of a thick litter layer, also known as a mor. Net primary production works inversely to this trend, suggesting that the accumulation of organic matter is mainly a result of decomposition rate.\n\nSurface detritus facilitates the capture and infiltration of rainwater into lower soil layers. Soil litter protects soil aggregates from raindrop impact, preventing the release of clay and silt particles from plugging soil pores. Releasing clay and silt particles reduces the capacity for soil to absorb water and increases cross surface flow, accelerating soil erosion. In addition soil litter reduces wind erosion by preventing soil from losing moisture and providing cover preventing soil transportation.\n\nOrganic matter accumulation also helps protect soils from wildfire damage. Soil litter can be completely removed depending on intensity and severity of wildfires and season. Regions with high frequency wildfires have reduced vegetation density and reduced soil litter accumulation. Climate also influences the depth of plant litter. Typically humid tropical and sub-tropical climates have reduced organic matter layers and horizons due to year round decomposition and high vegetation density and growth. In temperate and cold climates, litter tends to accuculate and decompose slower due to a shorter growing season.\n\nNet primary production and litterfall are intimately connected. In every terrestrial ecosystem, the largest fraction of all net primary production is lost to herbivores and litterfall. Due to their interconnectedness, global patterns of litterfall are similar to global patterns of net primary productivity.\n\nLitter provides habitat for a variety of organisms.\n\nCertain plants are specially adapted for germinating and thriving in the litter layers. For example, bluebell (\"Hyacinthoides non-scripta\") shoots puncture the layer to emerge in spring. Some plants with rhizomes, such as common wood sorrel (\"Oxalis acetosella\") do well in this habitat.\n\nMany organisms that live on the forest floor are decomposers, such as fungi. Organisms whose diet consists of plant detritus, such as earthworms, are termed detritivores. The community of decomposers in the litter layer also includes bacteria, amoeba, nematodes, rotifer, springtails, cryptostigmata, potworms, insect larvae, mollusks, oribatid mites, woodlice, and millipedes. Their consumption of the litterfall results in the breakdown of simple carbon compounds into carbon dioxide (CO) and water (HO), and releases inorganic ions (like nitrogen and phosphorus) into the soil where the surrounding plants can then reabsorb the nutrients that were shed as litterfall. In this way, litterfall becomes an important part of the nutrient cycle that sustains forest environments.\n\nAs litter decomposes, nutrients are released into the environment. The portion of the litter that is not readily decomposable is known as humus. Litter aids in soil moisture retention by cooling the ground surface and holding moisture in decaying organic matter. The flora and fauna working to decompose soil litter also aid in soil respiration. A litter layer of decomposing biomass provides a continuous energy source for macro- and micro-organisms.\n\nNumerous reptiles, amphibians, birds, and even some mammals rely on litter for shelter and forage. Amphibians such as salamanders and caecilians inhabit the damp microclimate underneath fallen leaves for part or all of their life cycle. This makes them difficult to observe. A BBC film crew captured footage of a female caecilian with young for the first time in a documentary that aired in 2008.\nSome species of birds, such as the ovenbird of eastern North America for example, require leaf litter for both foraging and material for nests. Sometimes litterfall even provides energy to much larger mammals, such as in boreal forests where lichen litterfall is one of the main constituents of wintering deer and elk diets.\n\nDuring leaf senescence, a portion of the plant’s nutrients are reabsorbed from the leaves. The nutrient concentrations in litterfall differ from the nutrient concentrations in the mature foliage by the reabsorption of constituents during leaf senescence. Plants that grow in areas with low nutrient availability tend to produce litter with low nutrient concentrations, as a larger proportion of the available nutrients is reabsorbed. After senescence, the nutrient-enriched leaves become litterfall and settle on the soil below.\n\nLitterfall is the dominant pathway for nutrient return to the soil, especially for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The accumulation of these nutrients in the top layer of soil is known as soil immobilization. Once the litterfall has settled, decomposition of the litter layer, accomplished through the leaching of nutrients by rainfall and throughfall and by the efforts of detritivores, releases the breakdown products into the soil below and therefore contributes to the cation exchange capacity of the soil. This holds especially true for highly weathered tropical soils.\n\nLeaching is the process by which cations such as iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al), as well as organic matter are removed from the litterfall and transported downward into the soil below. This process is known as podzolization and is particularly intense in boreal and cool temperate forests that are mainly constituted by coniferous pines whose litterfall is rich in phenolic compounds and fulvic acid.\n\nBy the process of biological decomposition by microfauna, bacteria, and fungi, CO and HO, nutrient elements, and a decomposition-resistant organic substance called humus are released. Humus composes the bulk of organic matter in the lower soil profile.\n\nThe decline of nutrient ratios is also a function of decomposition of litterfall (i.e. as litterfall decomposes, more nutrients enter the soil below and the litter will have a lower nutrient ratio). Litterfall containing high nutrient concentrations will decompose more rapidly and asymptote as those nutrients decrease. Knowing this, ecologists have been able to use nutrient concentrations as measured by remote sensing as an index of a potential rate of decomposition for any given area. Globally, data from various forest ecosystems shows an inverse relationship in the decline in nutrient ratios to the apparent nutrition availability of the forest.\n\nOnce nutrients have re-entered the soil, the plants can then reabsorb them through their roots. Therefore, nutrient reabsorption during senescence presents an opportunity for a plant’s future net primary production use. A relationship between nutrient stores can also be defined as:\n\nThe main objectives of litterfall sampling and analysis are to quantify litterfall production and chemical composition over time in order to assess the variation in litterfall quantities, and hence its role in nutrient cycling across an environmental gradient of climate (moisture and temperature) and soil conditions.\n\nEcologists employ a simple approach to the collection of litterfall, most of which centers around one piece of equipment, known as a litterbag. A litterbag is simply any type of container that can be set out in any given area for a specified amount of time to collect the plant litter that falls from the canopy above.\n\nLitterbags are generally set in random locations within a given area and marked with GPS or local coordinates, and then monitored on a specific time interval. Once the samples have been collected, they are usually classified on type, size and species (if possible) and recorded on a spreadsheet. When measuring bulk litterfall for an area, ecologists will weigh the dry contents of the litterbag. By this method litterfall flux can be defined as:\n\nThe litterbag may also be used to study decomposition of the litter layer. By confining fresh litter in the mesh bags and placing them on the ground, an ecologist can monitor and collect the decay measurements of that litter. An exponential decay pattern has been produced by this type of experiment: formula_1, where formula_2 is the initial leaf litter and formula_3 is a constant fraction of detrital mass.\n\nThe mass-balance approach is also utilized in these experiments and suggests that the decomposition for a given amount of time should equal the input of litterfall for that same amount of time.\n\nFor study various groups from edaphic fauna you need a different mesh sizes in the litterbags \n\nIn some regions of Australia and North America, earthworms have been introduced where they are not native. Non-native earthworms have led to environmental changes by accelerating the rate of decomposition of litter. These changes are being studied, but may have negative impacts on some inhabitants such as salamanders.\n\nThis thin, delicate layer of organic material can be easily affected by humans. For instance, forest litter raking as a replacement for straw in husbandry is an old non-timber practice in forest management that has been widespread in Europe since the seventeenth century. In 1853, an estimated 50 Tg dry litter per year was raked in European forests, when the practice reached its peak. This human disturbance, if not combined with other degradation factors, could promote podzolisation; if managed properly (for example, by burying litter removed after its use in animal husbandry), even the repeated removal of forest biomass may not have negative effects on pedogenesis.\n\n\n"}

This includes both physical and mental activities, covering a wide range of intensities and levels of social acceptability. The term originated in the BDSM club and party communities, indicating the activities taking place within a scene. It has since extended to the full range of BDSM activities.\n\nPlay can take many forms. It ranges from light \"getting to know you\" sessions where participants discover each other's likes and dislikes to extreme, extended play between committed individuals that know each other's limits and are willing to push or be pushed at their boundaries. While physical activities are better known and more infamous, it also includes 'mental play' such as erotic hypnosis and mind games.\n\nBDSM play is usually the primary topic of negotiation, especially for casual players and limited scenes. Most BDSM clubs and local communities offer classes and materials about negotiating play scenes. Play safety is a major topic of discussion and debate within BDSM communities.\n\nPlay is broken down into two broad categories, physical and mental. Physical play is better known and consists of the typical activities the average person thinks of as BDSM. As the BDSM scene matures and gains greater mainstream tolerance, mental play is becoming an increasingly noteworthy part of the community.\n\nPhysical BDSM encompasses all \"kinky\" activities that are carried out physically. Two of the best known examples are flogging and bondage. Extensive classes and workshops teach technical skills to carry out these activities competently, as well as safety considerations and protocols. This is the type of play most often seen in BDSM clubs and in media representations of kink. While often associated with sadism and masochism, many activities are not focused on or even involve pain. Non-painful sensation play and elaborate bondage done mainly for aesthetic purposes are prominent examples.\n\nMental BDSM is the collection of activities intended to create a psychological impact, often without a physical component. Recreational hypnosis is the most prominent example, with a well-developed international community. Another noteworthy but controversial example is the 'mind fuck', wherein a state confusion and/or psychological conflict is intentionally created. While mental 'players' have considerably less documented material to study, an active Internet community and classes offered through local groups and conventions provide many learning opportunities.\n\nParticipants in BDSM typically recognizes different types of play, based on their intensity and social acceptability. These distinctions can be rather arbitrary and variant. What is considered edge play for a particular couple or local community may be merely heavy play, or even light play, for others.\n\nLight play consists of activities that are considered mild and/or carry little social stigma. This especially includes BDSM elements commonly practiced by \"vanilla\" couples. Light bondage, slapping, and casual spanking are examples of light play.\n\nHeavy play indicates elements that are intense and/or carry substantial social stigma. The bulk of activities undertaken by BDSM participants would be considered heavy play or as bordering on heavy play. Examples of heavy play includes caning, suspension bondage, and erotic hypnosis.\n\nEdgeplay is a term used for types of play that \"push the edge.\" They usually involve a risk of physical or emotional harm. Breath play, knife play, gun play and blood play are all types of edge play. In males, restriction of flow of urine and semen may contribute to the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction.\n\nEdge play can also literally refer to playing with an edge, for example knives, swords and other implements. It is sometimes used to describe activities that challenge the boundaries of the participants.\n\nThis type of play generally falls under the umbrella of RACK (Risk Aware Consensual Kink).\n\nSafety and consent in play are paramount considerations within the BDSM community. Various models of consent and negotiation are employed. Most participants consider it important to take responsibility for the safety of their partners. In addition, consent is typically what they consider to distinguish BDSM activities from abuse (or more specifically, intimate partner violence).\n\n"}

{"id": "5287063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5287063", "title": "Proto-Anatolian language", "text": "Proto-Anatolian language\n\nProto-Anatolian is the proto-language from which Anatolian languages emerged. As with all other proto-languages, no attested writings have been found; the language has been reconstructed by applying the comparative method to all the attested Anatolian languages as well as other Indo-European languages.\n\nFor the most part, Proto-Anatolian has been reconstructed on the basis of Hittite, the best-attested Anatolian language. However, the usage of Hittite cuneiform writing system limits the enterprise of understanding and reconstructing Anatolian phonology, partly from the deficiency of the adopted Akkadian cuneiform syllabary to represent Hittite phonemes and partly from Hittite scribal practices.\n\nIt is especially pertinent to what appears to be confusion of voiceless and voiced dental stops, in which signs -dV- and -tV- are employed interchangeably in different attestations of the same word. Furthermore, in the syllables of the structure VC, only the signs with voiceless stops are usually used. Distribution of spellings with single and geminated consonants in the oldest extant monuments indicates that the reflexes of Proto-Indo-European voiceless stops were spelled as double consonants and the reflexes of PIE voiced stops as single consonants. This regularity is the most consistent in the case of dental stops in older texts; later monuments often show irregular variation of this rule.\n\nCommon Anatolian preserves the PIE vowel system basically intact. Some cite the merger of PIE */o/ and */a/ (including from *h₂e) as a Common Anatolian innovation, but according to Melchert that merger was a secondary shared innovation in Hittite, Palaic and Luvian, but not in Lycian. Concordantly, Common Anatolian had the following short vowel segments: */i/, */u/, */e/, */o/ and */a/.\n\nAmong the long vowels, */eː/ < PIE *ē is distinguished from */æː/ < PIE *eh₁, with the latter yielding \"ā\" in Luwian, Lydian and Lycian. Melchert (1994) had also earlier assumed a contrast between a closer mid front vowel */eː/ < PIE *ey (yielding Late Hittite \"ī\") and a more open */ɛː/ < PIE *ē (remaining Late Hittite \"ē\"), but the examples are few and can be accounted for otherwise.\n\nThe status of the opposition between long and short vowels is not entirely clear, but it is known for certain that it does not keep the PIE contrast intact, as Hittite spelling varies in a way that makes it very hard to establish whether vowels were inherently long or short. Even with older texts being apparently more conservative and consistent in notation, there are significant variations in vowel length in different forms of the same lexeme. It has been thus suggested by Carruba (1981) that the so-called \"scriptio plena\" represents not long vowels but rather stressed vowels, reflecting the position of free PIE accent. Carruba's interpretation is not universally accepted; according to Melchert, the only function of \"scriptio plena\" is to indicate vowel quantity; according to him the Hittite \"a\"/\"ā\" contrasts inherits diphonemic Proto-Anatolian contrast, */ā/ reflecting PIE */o/, */a/ and */ā/, and Proto-Anatolian */a/ reflecting PIE */a/. According to Melchert, the lengthening of accented short vowels in open syllables cannot be Proto-Anatolian, and the same goes for lengthening in accented closed syllables.\n\nOne of the more characteristic phonological features common to all Anatolian languages is the lenition of the Proto-Indo-European voiceless consonants (including the sibilant *s and the laryngeal *ḫ) between unstressed syllables and following long vowels. The two can be considered together as a lenition rule between unstressed moras, if long vowels are analyzed as a sequence of two vowels. All initial voiced stops in Anatolian eventually merge with the plain voiceless stops; Luwian, however, shows different treatment of *G- and *K-, showing that this was a late areal development, not a Proto-Anatolian one.\n\nProto-Anatolian is the only daughter language of Proto-Indo-European to retain the laryngeal consonants. The letter ‹ḫ› represents the laryngeal *h₂ and probably but less certainly also *h₃. The sequences *h₂w and *h₃w yield a labialized laryngeal *ḫʷ.\n\nIn addition to the laryngeals, Common Anatolian is also the only daughter to preserve the three-part velar consonant distinction from Proto-Indo-European. The best evidence for this comes from its daughter language, Luwian.\n\nThe voiced aspirated stops lost their aspiration over time and merged with the plain voiced stops. The liquids and nasals are inherited intact from Proto-Indo-European, and so is the glide *w. No native Proto-Anatolian words begin with *r-. One possible explanation is that it was true in Proto-Indo-European as well. Another is that it is a feature of languages from the area of Proto-Anatolian's daughter languages.\n\nAccording to Fortson, Proto-Anatolian had two verb conjugations. The first, the \"mi-conjugation\" was clearly derived from the familiar Proto-Indo-European present tense endings. The second, the \"ḫi-conjugation\" appears to be derived from the Proto-Indo-European perfect. One explanation is that Anatolian turned the perfect into a present tense for a certain group of verbs while another, newer idea is that the \"ḫi\" verbs continue a special class of presents which had a complicated relationship with the Proto-Indo-European perfect.\n\n\n"}

Her father, a teacher, writer and song collector collected older songs from the Oriel area and in Rannafast, and encouraged Pádraigín and her siblings to sing. \n\nPádraigín attended school at St Louis, County Monaghan before beginning a degree course at the University of Ulster\n\nIn August 1976, Pádraigín became a television newsreader at RTÉ, Ireland's national broadcaster. She also researched and presented numerous radio programmes in English and in Irish for RTÉ Radio.\n\nPádraigín left RTÉ in 1980 to become a school teacher in Athlone, County Westmeath.\n\nIn 1994, Pádraigín recorded her first full-length album with Garry Ó Briain. \"A Stór is a Stóirín\" was released on the acclaimed Gael Linn label and featured 36 songs for all ages, with an emphasis on songs suitable for primary school children.\n\nBritain's Channel 4 commissioned music videos for a number of songs on the album, featuring dramatisations of the lyrics as well as performances from Pádraigín. The videos later became regular features on TnaG (Ireland's newly launched Irish language television channel) between 1996 and 1998. That same year, she also featured on the television programme \"Light, Darkness and Colour\".\n\nWith the album's popularity growing, Pádraigín began the recording of her second album, again with Gael Linn. In 1995, Ní Uallacháin released \"An Dara Craiceann: Beanath the Surface\". It featured unaccompanied sean-nós songs and songs set to music, including the works of Irish poet Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill.\n\nPádraigín's third album, \"When I Was Young\", was a collaboration between Garry Ó Briain (with whom she had collaborated on her first album), and her husband, folk singer Len Graham, and was released on the Gael Linn label in 1999. Two years later, Pádraigín released fourth album, \"An Irish Lullaby: Suantraí\", under the Shanachie label in the United States. The recording featured collaborations with Len Graham, Garry Ó Briain, Máire Breatnach, harpist Helen Davies, fiddler Nollaig Casey and Uilleann piper Ronan Browne.\n\nPádraigín left teaching in the Summer of 1999 to become a full-time musician and composer and began her doctorate at the University of Ulster.\n\nPádraigín released her fifth album, \"An Dealg Óir: The Golden Thorn\" in 2002. The track-list consisted mainly of songs from southeast Ulster, Oriel in particular. At the time, Pádraigín was studying the traditions, songs and people of the area. The album was again released on the Gael Linn label and features influential Irish musicians and singers, including Steve Cooney, Liam O'Flynn, Liam Ó Maonlaí and Máire Breatnach.\n\nThe following year, Ní Uallacháin's book, \"A Hidden Ulster: People, songs and traditions of Oriel\" was published with Four Courts Press, featuring 540 pages of rare songs, their histories, biographies of authors, collectors and scribes and documentation of folk traditions in Oriel from the 17th century onwards. Television and radio programmes and series were produced, based on 'A Hidden Ulster' and featuring Ní Uallacháin on RTÉ Radio 1, TG4, RTÉ1 and on BBC radio. \"A Hidden Ulster\" was met with critical acclaim and featured in the Times Literary Supplement as a Book of the Year, and Irish Times Books of the Year list. After the book's publication in 2003, Pádraigín was awarded \"Gradam Shean-Nós Cois Life\" in 2003 for her contribution to the Irish song tradition, and became the first traditional artist to be awarded a \"Major Arts Award\" from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.\n\nIn 2005, \"A Hidden Ulster\" was shortlisted for the 2005 Michaelis-Jena Ratcliff Prize in Folklore and Folklife. That same year, Pádraigín was named Traditional Singer in Residence at the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry at Queen's University Belfast.\n\nPádraigín released her sixth album, \"Áilleacht: Beauty\" in 2005. It is a collection of newly written and composed songs in Irish. \"Áilleacht\" garnered enthusiastic reviews and praise from both press and academics, with poet Louis de Paor stating:\n\nPádraigín performed songs from the album on BBC NI and RTÉ, alongside other performers to celebrate the publication of \"An Leabhar Mór: The Great Book of Gaelic\", which was launched in Ireland and Scotland over a period of months in the countries various cities.

As Traditional Singer in Residence at the Seamus Heaney Centre she collaborated with poets Ciaran Carson and Seamus Heaney on editing and translating song-poems from ancient Irish manuscripts, written by Irish scribes and scribe-poets. To record the album, Pádraigín travelled to St. Gallen, Switzerland to read the Irish manuscripts that had been removed from the country for safe-keeping in the event of Viking attack. \"Songs of the Scribe\" features all new compositions for poems and marginalia in Old Irish and in English. \"Songs of the Scribe\" received a positive reception and remained on the Celtic Note album charts for seven months between March and September 2012.\n\nThe recording of \"Songs of the Scribe\" and Ní Uallacháin's visit to St. Gallen saw Ní Uallacháin begin work on a new creative album with fiddler/producer Dónal O'Connor based on older writings, including lore surrounding Irish Goddess Brigid. Pádraigín is also researching for a new book on the songs from the Irish Kingdom of Bréifne.\n\nLET THE FAIRIES IN, Pádraigín's latest album of children's songs was released in September 2012.\nCEOLTAÍ OIRIALLA - Songs of Oriel - a double CD of renewed songs by her of her native Oriel with and without accompaniment was released in 2017.\nher most recent project was the renewal of Oriel music and song online, www.orielarts.com which was funded by the Arts Council of Ireland \n\nShe is the first recipient of a Mayor Arts Award for a traditional musician from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland,\nGradam Sean-Nós Cois Life,\nGradam TG4 Award for outstanding contribution to traditional music\n\nPádraigín lives in Glendesha, County Armagh and has two sons, Eoghan and Macdara https://www.facebook.com/MacdaraJewellery/.

It was earlier circulated in preprint. The problems involved have largely been resolved, with all but the \"telescope conjecture\" being proved in later papers by others. The telescope conjecture is now generally believed not to be true, though there are some conflicting claims concerning it in the published literature, and is taken to be an open problem. Ravenel's conjectures exerted influence on the field through the founding of the approach of chromatic homotopy theory.\n\nThe first of the seven conjectures, then the \"nilpotence conjecture\", is now the nilpotence theorem. The telescope conjecture, which was #4 on the original list, remains of substantial interest because of its connection with the convergence of an Adams–Novikov spectral sequence. While opinion is against the truth of the original statement, investigations of associated phenomena (for a triangulated category in general) have become a research area in its own right.\n"}
{"id": "22456146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22456146", "title": "Reductio ad absurdum", "text": "Reductio ad absurdum\n\nIn logic, ' (), also known as ' (Latin for \"argument to absurdity\") or the appeal to extremes, is a form of argument that attempts either to disprove a statement by showing it inevitably leads to a ridiculous, absurd, or impractical conclusion, or to prove one by showing that if it were not true, the result would be absurd or impossible. Traced back to classical Greek philosophy in Aristotle's \"Prior Analytics\" (, 62b), this technique has been used throughout history in both formal mathematical and philosophical reasoning, as well as in debate.\n\nThe \"absurd\" conclusion of a \"reductio ad absurdum\" argument can take a range of forms, as these examples show:\nThe first example argues that denial of the premise would result in a ridiculous conclusion, against the evidence of our senses. The second example is a mathematical proof by contradiction which argues that the denial of the premise would result in a logical contradiction (there is a \"smallest\" number and yet there is a number smaller than it).\n\nThis technique is used throughout Greek philosophy, beginning with Presocratic philosophers. The earliest Greek example of a argument is supposedly in fragments of a satirical poem attributed to Xenophanes of Colophon (c. 570 – c. 475 BCE). Criticizing Homer's attribution of human faults to the gods, he states that humans also believe that the gods' bodies have human form. But if horses and oxen could draw, they would draw the gods with horse and oxen bodies. The gods cannot have both forms, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the attribution of other human characteristics to the gods, such as human faults, is also false.\n\nThe earlier dialogues of Plato (424–348 BCE), relating the debates of his teacher Socrates, raised the use of arguments to a formal dialectical method (), now called the Socratic method which is taught in law schools. Typically Socrates' opponent would make an innocuous assertion, then Socrates by a step-by-step train of reasoning, bringing in other background assumptions, would make the person admit that the assertion resulted in an absurd or contradictory conclusion, forcing him to abandon his assertion. The technique was also a focus of the work of Aristotle (384–322 BCE).\n\nGreek mathematicians proved fundamental propositions utilizing reductio ad absurdum. Euclid of Alexandria (mid-3rd – mid-4th centuries BCE) and Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 – c. 212 BCE) are two very early examples.\n\nAristotle clarified the connection between contradiction and falsity in his principle of non-contradiction, which states that a proposition cannot be both true and false. That is, a proposition and its negation cannot both be true. Therefore if a proposition formula_1 and its negation formula_2 (not-\"Q\") can both be derived logically from a premise, it can be concluded that the premise is false. This technique, called proof by contradiction has formed the basis of arguments in formal fields like logic and mathematics.\n\n"}

{"id": "382334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=382334", "title": "Speakers' Corner", "text": "Speakers' Corner\n\nA Speakers' Corner is an area where open-air public speaking, debate, and discussion are allowed. The original and most noted is in the northeast corner of Hyde Park in London, England. Historically there were a number of other areas designated as Speakers' Corners in other parks in London (e.g., Lincoln's Inn Fields, Finsbury Park, Clapham Common, Kennington Park, and Victoria Park). More recently, they have been set up in other British cities, and there are also Speakers' Corners in other countries.\n\nSpeakers here may talk on any subject, as long as the police consider their speeches lawful, although this right is not restricted to Speakers' Corner only. Contrary to popular belief, there is no immunity from the law, nor are any subjects proscribed, but in practice the police intervene only when they receive a complaint. On some occasions in the past, they have intervened on grounds of profanity. \n\nThough Hyde Park Speakers' Corner is considered the paved area closest to Marble Arch, legally the public speaking area extends beyond the Reform Tree and covers a large area from Marble Arch to Victoria Gate, then along the Serpentine to Hyde Park Corner and the Broad Walk running from Hyde Park Corner to Marble Arch.\n\nPublic riots broke out in the park in 1855, in protest over the Sunday Trading Bill, which forbade buying and selling on a Sunday, the only day working people had off. The riots were (rather sanguinely) described by Karl Marx as the beginning of the English revolution.\n\nThe Chartist movement used Hyde Park as a point of assembly for workers' protests, but no permanent speaking location was established. The Reform League organised a massive demonstration in 1866 and then again in 1867, which compelled the government to extend the franchise to include most working-class men.\n\nThe riots and agitation for democratic reform encouraged some to force the issue of the \"right to speak\" in Hyde Park. The Parks Regulation Act 1872 delegated the issue of permitting public meetings to the park authorities (rather than central government). Contrary to popular belief, it does not confer a statutory basis for the right to speak at Speakers' Corner. Parliamentary debates on the Act illustrate that a general principle of being able to meet and speak was not the intention, but that some areas would be permitted to be used for that purpose.\n\nSince that time, it has become a traditional site for public speeches and debate, as well as a major site of protest and assembly in Britain. There are some who contend that the tradition has a connection with the Tyburn gallows, where the condemned man was allowed to speak before being hanged.\n\nSpeakers' Corner is often held up to demonstrate freedom of speech, as anyone can turn up unannounced and talk on almost any subject, although always at the risk of being heckled by regulars. The corner was frequented by Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, George Orwell, C. L. R. James, Walter Rodney, Ben Tillett, Marcus Garvey, Kwame Nkrumah, and William Morris. Lord Justice Sedley, in \"Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions\" (1999), described Speakers' Corner as demonstrating \"the tolerance which is both extended by the law to opinion of every kind and expected by the law in the conduct of those who disagree, even strongly, with what they hear.\" The ruling famously established in English case law that freedom of speech could not be limited to the inoffensive but extended also to \"the irritating, the contentious, the eccentric, the heretical, the unwelcome, and the provocative, as long as such speech did not tend to provoke violence\", and that the right to free speech accorded by Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights also accorded the right to be offensive. Prior to the ruling, prohibited speech at Speakers' Corner included obscenity, blasphemy, insulting the queen, or inciting a breach of the peace. \n\nIn the late 19th century, for instance, a combination of park by-laws, use of the Highways Acts and use of venue licensing powers of the London County Council made it one of the few places where socialist speakers could meet and debate.\n\nThe following organisations and individuals, listed here in chronological order, have (had) a well-established history of speaking regularly in Hyde Park.\n\nThe first official Speakers' Corner outside London opened in Nottingham in 2009. It was officially inaugurated by Jack Straw, the UK Justice Secretary, on 22 February 2009. The designated space occupied a new landscaped extension to the city's Old Market Square, at the junction of King Street and Queen Street. The large paved space includes the new statue of Brian Clough, the former manager of Derby County and Nottingham Forest, who forged ties between the two cities which were famous for local rivalry.\n\nSpeakers Corner Lichfield was launched in May 2009, with the help of the Speakers’ Corner Trust, to much applause. Hundreds of people joined in the celebrations which featured over 30 speeches, musical and dance performances, as well as star appearances from BBC’s Jo Malin and former Coronation Street Star Chris Walker.\n\nToday Speakers’ Corner is a site for events and activities, as well as a destination for all the community to visit and have their say on topics close to their hearts.\n\nSince the launch, a plaque has been unveiled at the site, along with a code of conduct. Plans for the site include a stone plaque marking the spot, as well as a series of annual events.\n\nThe Sussex coastal town of Worthing has had its own Speakers' Corner at Splash Point on the town's seafront since the Victorian era. A sign today marks the \"stand for delivering sermons and public speeches\", while another sign close by marks the site by the old Fish Market where the Salvation Army has preached the Gospel since 1886. The Speakers' Corner fell into disuse in the late 20th century and is now being reinstated. As part of the Government's \"Sea Change\" programme, being run by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, the area will benefit from a £500,000 grant to re-landscape the area around Splash Point and see a revival of the Speakers' Corner. Speakers' corner comprises a dais accessible by steps and a ramp providing a platform from which speakers address the crowd or passers by. It is due for completion by October 2010.\n\nLeeds is known to have its own Speakers' Corner, at Victoria Gardens on the Headrow, in front of the Leeds City Art Gallery, Central Library and Henry Moore Sculpture Centre building. It is a pivotal point in Leeds for justice and anti-war marches, most of which gather and terminate here, as well as for war memorial services due to the location of Leeds's Municipal Cenotaph.\n\nThe stepped base of Grey's Monument is used as a stage by assorted musicians, preachers and activists. Verbal clashes between left-wing and right-wing groups are frequent.\n\nThere is a Speakers' Corner in the Domain in Sydney, established in 1878. The speakers talk every Sunday afternoon from 2 pm until 5 pm, and have a website. Official outdoor \"free\" speech first appeared in the hustings and hanging grounds of Hyde Park Sydney in 1874. Free speech in this form was banned following a serious riot between Catholics and Orangemen. However, following the formalisation of free speech in Speakers' Corner in London it was decided in 1878 that The Domain would be the place for free speech in Sydney.\n\nIn 'Diary of a Voyage to Australia, New Zealand and other lands' (published 1896), Robert Roberts notes that \"On the west side [of a particular location] is a feature peculiar to Sydney in all the world - a preaching park. There are of course, parks in other cities where open-air spouting is practiced on Sundays, such as Hyde Park, in London : but there is no city in the world where a park on such a scale is used by all classes of religious people. It is a wooded enclosure, like a nobleman's park in England, kept in capital order, both as regards the turf under foot, and the tall and noble trees that give shelter overhead from the sun.\" \"All the sects and denominations use it. There is none of the sense of infra dig that associates itself with out-door preaching in England.\"\"Every denomination has its own tree.\" \"The various religious bodies hold their meetings sufficiently apart to make no interference one with the other. It is a sort of weekly babel of religious tongues - recognised and patronised by the whole community\"\n\nOther Speakers' Corners are found outside Parliament House, in King George Square, and at The Powerhouse in Brisbane. In Melbourne, Speakers' Corner was originally held in Birrarung Marr where the original site is still visible. This site has lost some popularity over the years and Speakers' Corner (Now called \"Speakers' Forum\") is currently held outside the State Library of Victoria on Sunday afternoon from 3 pm.\n\nDedicated by the Earl Mountbatten on 12 April 1966, Speakers' Corner in Regina, Saskatchewan is located on the north shore of Wascana Lake. It serves as a constant reminder of the notion of free speech and assembly and a tribute to Saskatchewan people who have upheld that heritage. The two lanterns framing the south entrance to the main plaza formed part of the Cumberland Screen at the entrance to Speakers' Corner in London. The podia on the main plaza are from the exterior columns of the Old City Hall (1908–1965) and symbolise free speech in democracy at the municipal level of government. Six paper birch trees were taken from Runnymede Meadow in Windsor Great Park, near Windsor Castle. It was there that King John signed Magna Carta on 15 June 1215. The ten gas lamps surrounding the corner come from King Charles Street which runs from Whitehall to St. James Park, London, near the Houses of Parliament. They were erected in 1908 during the reign of Edward VII, whose royal cypher E.R. VII appears on the base of each lamp.\n\nKitchener, Ontario has a small area designated as Speakers' Corner on the northwest corner of King and Frederick Streets. It existed already since the mid-1980s.\n\nMass demonstration and speeches are traditionally held on the Hotel Indonesia roundabout Selamat Datang Monument. This venue however, is located the middle of Jakarta's main boulevard and commercial district, thus causing a severe traffic jam when a rally is held. To accommodate this, Jakarta's provincial government built a small park on the northwestern corner of the Merdeka Square, across the Istana Merdeka, Indonesia's presidential palace. Officially named 'Taman Pandang Istana' (Palace-View Park), this park is known commonly as 'Taman Unjuk Rasa' (Demonstration Park).\n\nAs a tribute to democracy and freedom of speech, in Lajatico, Pisa there a small area designated as Speakers' Corner (\"L'angolo del parlatore\") on a corner of the Vittorio Veneto main square. It is opened for the public to speak on Sundays (9 to 11 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m.). The first speaker was the mayor Alessio Barbarfieri, who highlighted the importance of the acts of speaking and listening for a good and effective local governance.\n\nThe first Speakers' Square in Malaysia was established at the Esplanade, George Town, Penang on 4 May 2010. It is opened for the public to speak on Wednesday and Sunday (6.00 pm to 10.00 pm). The first speaker was Tan Seng Hai who shared his views on preventing Ascot Sports Sdn. Bhd. from conducting betting activities in the Penang state.\n\nConditions for use of Speakers' Square\n\nIn the Netherlands, there is a permanently designated speakers' corner called the Spreeksteen in Amsterdam. Lawfully, every person has the freedom of speech as a matter of right. The 'Spreeksteen' is open for free speech 24-hours a day, and was established to allow complete free speech. The 'Spreeksteen' has been located in the Oosterpark in Amsterdam since 5 May 2005, and has been erected by a citizens action after the brutal murder of film-maker and columnist Theo van Gogh. Plans for bringing the Amsterdam Speakers' Corner online with a permanent camera and microphone are in a phase of installation. In the meantime the speakers are filmed with a hand-held camera.\n\nThe Spreeksteen was involved in controversy when they allowed Michiel Smit, a far-right activist, to speak on 1 October 2006. Antifascist demonstrators used noise to prevent Smit from being heard (as happens often when there is a public demonstration of the far-right).\n\nThere is a Speakers' Corner in Albert Park in Auckland at Princes Street, opposite to the University of Auckland.\n\nThe Speakers' Corner in Singapore was opened on 1 September 2000, to allow Singapore citizens to speak freely. They are exempted from the need to obtain a police permit as long as they meet the terms and conditions of use.\n\nThe Speakers' Corner is located in Hong Lim Park, a popular venue for many election rallies and political speeches in the 1950s and '60s. Hong Lim Park is centrally located, well-served by public transport and is sited in a high public density area.\n\nIn 2004, public exhibitions and performances were added to the list of exempted activities at the Speakers' Corner.\n\nFrom 1 September 2008, Singapore citizens can also organise or participate in demonstrations at Speakers' Corner without having to obtain a police permit. With this latest change in policy to allow the venue to be used freely as an outdoor demonstration site, coupled with the liberalisation on the use of sound amplification and the extension of operating hours of the venue, the Speakers' Corner aims to address the genuine desire by some Singaporeans for lawful outdoor demonstrations and processions as a means of political expression.\n\nSingapore citizens who wish to hold a speech, exhibition/performance or demonstration at the Speakers' Corner can register with the National Parks Board, which manages Hong Lim Park. Online registration is available on the website.\n\nWoodford Square in Port of Spain, Trinidad, is also known as \"The University of Woodford Square\", so named by the first prime minister of Trinidad Eric Williams, who gave many speeches here. Another nickname, \"People's Parliament\", comes from the Black Power movement of the 1970s. Flanked by Trinidad's Parliament and Halls of Justice the Square still plays host to speeches of a highly topical and political nature.\n\nIn the southeast corner of the square, a blackboard lists the day's discussion as well as other important information. The speakers' topics are divided by interest and known as \"classes\".\n\nAn area was set up in Bangkok in the 1930s, and quickly became known as Hyde Park, to enable freedom of speech and the airing of political views in Thailand. The area was shut down after student rioting and the lethal intervention of the army and it is not discussed openly today.\n\nIn 1955, Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram had visited London as part of an international tour. He became impressed with the 'Speakers' Corner' in Hyde Park. Upon his return to Thailand a 'Hyde Park' space for free speech and assembly was instituted at the Phramane Grounds in Bangkok. The experiment was well received and effectively stimulated political debate. The experiment was not appreciated by the government though, and in February 1956 restrictions were imposed on the Phramane 'Hyde Park'. However, during this period the Hyde Park Movement Party had evolved, upholding the legacy of the Hyde Park experiment.\n\nTom L. Johnson, the radical reforming Mayor of Cleveland (1901–1909), dedicated the north-west quadrant of Public Square to Free Speech, as in Hyde Park. Speeches and meetings there were common in the early part of the century; Anarchist Emma Goldman addressed a large crowd there in 1908. Today the site remains the traditional place for rallies and demonstrations in Cleveland, around Mayor Johnson's statue.\n\nThe University of California at Berkeley had a free speech area in front of Sproul Plaza until 1964. The University of Missouri hosts a Speaker's Corner, referred to as \"Speaker's Circle\". There are only two such locations in the entire state of Missouri. \n\nAs a result of winter semesters visits to England and Hyde Park, Elon College (now known as Elon University) created a Speakers' Corner on campus. No persons from outside the university may speak without a permit. Students are free to speak at any time as long as they don't use amplification, do not disrupt others, do not damage property (including the lawn itself) and do not cause dangerous conditions (stakes may not be planted in the ground without the approval of Physical Plant due to electrical/water lines, etc.).\n\nSee also Washington Square Park (Chicago) regarding the history of Bughouse Square in Chicago, known as a free speech site from the 1910s to the 1960s.\n\nThe pedestrian-only area of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House in Washington, D.C. has become a de facto speaker's corner. Consistent with the principles of the first amendment, ad hoc public speaking is generally legal in all public places in Washington DC, although organized demonstrations require police permits. \n\nInspired by Speakers' Corner, Karl Dean, the Mayor of Nashville, designated a space for live music in the south-west corner of Centennial Park (Nashville), calling it Musicians Corner. A free concert series of the same name takes place in this space each year.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23673038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23673038", "title": "Strata management", "text": "Strata management\n\nStrata management, sometimes known as \"body corporate management\", is a specialist area of property management involving the day-to-day operation and management of a property that is jointly owned and comprises multiple units, common areas and common facilities. It is derived from an Australian concept of property law called strata title applied to the administration of common ownership in apartment buildings on multiple levels, or strata. Emerging markets in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, the Philippines and India have adopted the Australian system. It is one of the fastest growing forms of housing in the United States today, similar to common-interest development (CID), a category that includes planned unit developments of single-family homes, known as homeowner associations (HOAs), condominiums, and cooperative apartments. Federally-subsidized financing provided by two government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac via uniform financial instruments—mortgages that oblige the borrower to honour covenant restrictions of the collective-property regime with PUD or condo riders. Such provisions however are only enforceable where statutes recognise their validity. Common expense liabilities are often subordinated as junior liens in bankruptcy courts, with the bank retaining senior title.\n\nThe successful management of such developments requires the establishment of a strata title system to provide a framework for ownership, and guidelines to manage developments with multiple users and owners.\n\nMany jurisdictions adopt the concept of jointly-owned property. Owners in these types of schemes automatically become members of an owners' or community association. These associations ultimately bear responsibility for the maintenance and management of common areas such as lobbies and corridors, and shared leisure facilities such as swimming pools and gyms. They are also responsible for running the administrative and financial aspects of the property.\n\nThe strata manager's role is to work with the owners' corporation and executive committee to successfully control, manage, maintain and administer the property and to create an appropriate community environment and includes tasks such as:\n\n\nStrata management in New South Wales, Australia is currently governed by legislation including the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 and the Strata Schemes Management Regulation 2010. However, in October 2015 the New South Wales Parliament passed the \"Strata Schemes Management Act 2015\" and the \"Strata Schemes Development Act 2015\" which largely replace the previous Acts governing strata management. Together, the Acts establish over 90 key reforms with the aim of simplifying strata laws. The majority of these reforms commenced on 30 November 2016. Some major changes include strengthening accountability of strata managers, quicker and simpler approval process for resolving disputes including renovation requests, tenant participation in meetings (scheme with over 50% tenants), electronic means for voting on motions, ability to fine unauthorised car parking, removing property developer's authority and influence in formulating Owners Corporation which can bind owners, guidelines to deal with construction defects, curbing practice of proxy farming. \n\nAll Schemes must review their current by-laws by 30 November 2017.\n\nA strata scheme is a building, or collection of buildings, where individual each own a small portion known as a 'lot' but where there is also common property (e.g. external walls, windows, roofs, driveways, foyers, fences, lawns and gardens). Every owner shares the ownership of the common property. Strata schemes apply to residential developments, commercial, industrial, mixed use, hotel and retirement villages.\n\nLot owners own the inside of the unit but not the main structure of the building. Usually the four main walls, the ceiling and roof and the floor are common property. The dividing walls within the lot, floor coverings, and fixtures such as baths, toilet bowls and bench tops are all the property of the lot owner.\n\nThe key concept is that the lot owner effectively owns the airspace (and anything included in the airspace) inside the boundary walls, floor and ceiling of the lot. Airspace can extend to balconies and courtyards.\n\nLot owners and prospective purchasers with written permission from a lot owner, can inspect the books and records of a strata scheme for a fee in accordance with section 108 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. There are companies which specialise in inspecting the books and records and can organise a 'strata search' inspection.\n\nLot owners and prospective purchasers with written permission from a lot owner, can also request a certificate containing basic information about the strata scheme in accordance with section 109 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996, including the levies to be paid, outstanding levies and any special by-laws made by the owners corporation in the past two years.\n\nAn owners corporation is responsible for the same type of expenses as a conventional householder. These include utilities, building insurance and repair and maintenance. To cover the costs of expenses, the law requires that each owners corporation establishes an administrative fund and a sinking fund and raises levies from owners in accordance with section 76 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. All levies must be charged in proportion to the unit entitlements of each lot in accordance with section 78 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. Levies must be decided at each annual general meeting.\n\nThe administrative fund is for day-to-day recurrent expenses, whereas the sinking fund is for the costs of future capital expenses.\n\nFrom July 2009, each owners' corporation is required to have a ten-year sinking fund plan. Developing a ten-year sinking fund plan means that future repairs and maintenance are anticipated well in advance.\n\nIf the owners corporation has to pay a debt that was not budgeted for in either fund estimates, a special levy must be agreed at a general meeting and paid to the administrative fund in accordance with section 76 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996.\n\nAn unpaid levy incurs interest at the rate of 10% simple interest a year if not paid within one month after it is due.\n\nThe owners corporation is responsible for making sure all necessary insurance policies are in place in accordance with section 83 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. The building must be valued every five years in accordance with section 85 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996.\n\nThe owners corporation must keep certain records for at least 5 years including minutes of its meetings, correspondence, proxies and financial records.\n\nThe owners corporation must prepare and keep a strata roll in accordance with section 96 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 including the name and addresses of all lot owners, tenants, mortgagees, the original owner and the managing agent, the units of entitlement, insurance details and the by-laws for the strata scheme.\n\nThe owners corporation must repair common property and lot owners must repair anything in their lot. However, this can be difficult as it is not always clear what is common property and what belongs to the lot owner.\n\nStarting 30 November 2016, cosmetic changes to the lot will not require the owners' corporation's approval. Minor and major renovations, including changes to floorboards or changes to the structural and external appearance of the building will still require approval of 50% (general resolution) and 75% (special resolution) respectively.\n\nThere is no mandatory set of by-laws. Some model by-laws are set out in legislation, others are set by the original owner. By-laws can be added, changed or repealed at a general meeting if the motion passes.\n\nThe owners corporation can engage a strata managing agent to work on behalf of all owners to help manage the strata scheme by entering into a managing agency agreement, which outlines their duties and responsibilities. The appointment of a managing agent can only be decided by a majority vote at a general meeting in accordance with section 27 as the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. Agents carry out some or all of the functions or duties or powers of the owners corporation including administrative matters such as calling meetings and collecting levies.\n\nThe owners corporation must elect an executive committee which can make many of the day-to-day decisions about running the strata scheme on its behalf rather than deciding matters purely at general meetings however the owners corporation can overrule executive committee decisions or limit what they can make decisions about. The executive committee is elected at each annual general meeting. It can have between one and nine members. Once elected, the members decide who is to hold the office-bearers positions of chairperson, secretary and treasurer. Executive committee members can be elected if they are an owner, a company nominee or a person who is not an owner but who is nominated by an owner who is not standing for election.\n\nThe first annual general meeting must be held within two months of the end of the initial period, which is once one third of the total units of entitlement have been sold and the lot owner information is recorded on the strata roll. The agenda includes deciding the insurance cover, accounting records, election of the executive committee, by-laws and the appointment of the strata managing agent and caretaker. Notice of the meeting must be given to each owner of a lot at least seven days before the meeting. If notices are being mailed, an additional four working days must be allowed for postage.\n\nThe annual general meeting agenda includes confirming previous minutes, a copy of the financial statements, information about insurance policies, appointing auditors and election of the executive committee. The notice period is the same as first annual general meetings.\n\nAny general meeting of the owners corporation that is not an annual general meeting is called an extraordinary general meeting. These meetings can be held when necessary. The notice period is the same as first general meetings.\n\nThe executive committee agenda is held after the annual general meeting includes confirming previous minutes, appointing the office bearers and general day-to-day matters that arise. Notice of the meeting must be placed on the notice board 72 hours before the meeting. If the owners corporation does not have a notice board or the strata scheme is considered a large strata scheme, the meeting notice must be given to all lot owners.

He was a journalist and columnist and the co-editor of several periodicals. He was awarded the Madhuban Vyanga Shri Samman in 2017 for his satirical works.\n\nBorn in the village of Bheera, Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh, on 2 July 1958, Sushil Siddharth did his Ph.D. from the University of Lucknow.\n\nAfter finishing his higher education, Siddharth became involved in the literary circles of Lucknow while continuing as a freelance writer for newspapers and magazines. He considered Gyan Chaturvedi the father of satire, and his personal mentor. He also co-edited the Hindi periodicals \"Tadbhav\" and \"Kathakrama\". His column in the latter, titled \"Raag Lantrani\", brought him recognition. During 1988–90, Siddharth and Ram Bahadur Mishra jointly edited and published \"Birwa\", a quarterly magazine dedicated to promoting the Awadhi language. Siddharth was additionally a guest faculty at the Mahatma Gandhi International Hindi University, and also wrote plays for television and radio. Since its inception, he had been a regular contributor to \"Indraprastha Bharti\", a magazine of the Hindi Academy in New Delhi, where his column \"Kataaksh\" was highly popular. He wrote four collections of satire: \"Preeti Na Kariyo Koy\", \"Mo Sam Kaun\", \"Naarad Ki Chinta\", \"Maalish Mahapurana\"; and contributed two anthologies of poems: \"Eka\" and \"Bagan Bagan Kahe Chiriya\" in Awadhi.\n\nThe twice nominated Siddharth for its Best satire and Best Awadhi poem awards. In 2017, he was awarded the Madhuban Vyanga Shri Samman for his satirical works. Siddharth worked as an editor for the Rajkamal Prakashan group before joining Kitabghar Prakashan, where he served till his death. He edited the book series \"Vyanga Samay\". For his work in literary criticism, Siddharth was awarded by Bhopal's Spandan Sanstha.\n\nSiddharth stayed alone in Delhi while his family lived in Lucknow. He died on 17 March 2018 from complications arising after a heart attack. His body was cremated the following day in Lucknow's Bhainsakund Crematorium. A condolence ceremony in his memory was held at 's residence. Fellow writer Dayanand Pandey said that satire was the oxygen in Siddharth's life. Novelist Maitreyi Pushpa was of the view that Siddharth's talent was never properly treasured in his lifetime, and that publishers for whom he worked took advantage of his financial condition.\n"}

{"id": "178693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178693", "title": "Transculturation", "text": "Transculturation\n\nTransculturation is a term coined by Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortiz in 1947 to describe the phenomenon of merging and converging cultures.\n\nTransculturation encompasses more than transition from one culture to another; it does not consist merely of acquiring another culture (acculturation) or of losing or uprooting a previous culture (deculturation). Rather, it merges these concepts and additionally carries the idea of the consequent creation of new cultural phenomena (neoculturation). Ortiz also referred to the devastating impact of Spanish colonialism on Cuba's indigenous peoples as a \"failed transculturation\". Transculturation can often be the result of colonial conquest and subjugation, especially in a postcolonial era as native peoples struggle to regain their own sense of identity.\n\nIn simple terms, transculturation reflects the natural tendency of people (in general) to resolve conflicts over time, rather than exacerbating them. (In the modern context, both conflicts and resolutions are amplified by communication and transportation technology—the ancient tendency of cultures drifting or remaining apart has been replaced by stronger forces for bringing societies together.) Where transculturation impacts ethnicity and ethnic issues the term \"ethnoconvergence\" is sometimes used.\n\nIn one general sense, transculturation covers war, ethnic conflict, racism, multiculturalism, cross-culturalism, interracial marriage, and any other of a number of contexts that deal with more than one culture. In the other general sense, transculturation is one aspect of global phenomena and human events.\n\nThe general processes of transculturation are extremely complex—steered by powerful forces at the macrosocial level, yet ultimately resolved at the interpersonal level. The driving force for conflict is simple proximity—boundaries, once separating people (providing for a measure of isolation) become the issue of a conflict when societies encroach upon one another territorially. If a means to co-exist cannot be immediately found, then conflicts can be hostile, leading to a process by which contact between individuals leads to some resolution. Often, history shows us, the processes of co-existence begins with hostilities, and with the natural passing of polarist individuals, comes the passing of their polarist sentiments, and soon some resolution is achieved. Degrees of hostile conflict vary from outright genocidal conquest, to lukewarm infighting between differing political views within the same ethnic community.\n\nThese changes often represent differences between homeland pons, and their diasporic communities abroad. Nevertheless, obstacles to ethnoconvergence are not great. The primary issue; language, (\"hence, communication and education\") can be overcome within a single generation—as is evident in the easy acclimation of children of foreign parents. English, for example, is spoken by more non-Anglo-American people than Anglo-Americans, making it the current lingua-franca, the worldwide de facto standard international language.\n\nProcesses of transculturation become more complex within the context of globalization, given the multiple layers of abstraction that permeate everyday experiences. Elizabeth Kath argues that in the global era we can no longer consider transculturation only in relation to the face-to-face, but that we need to take into account the many layers of abstracted interactions that are interwoven through face-to-face encounters, a phenomenon that she describes as \"layers of transculturation\". Kath draws upon the concept of constitutive abstraction as seen in the work of Australian social theorists Geoff Sharp and Paul James.\n\nIt has been observed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a \"modernized\" primordial identity, apart from others. Some intellectuals, such as Michael Ignatieff, argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in ethnic identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups, despite being of an identical \"super-ethnicity\", such as nationality.\n\nWithin each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures, and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic group is often manifested in issues of sexual partners and marriage, employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; assimilation, homogenization, acculturation, and cultural compromise are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.\n\nOften it's in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimised and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created (\"center\" culture versus \"periphery\") but on the other hand, they will still share a common \"culture\", and common language and behaviours. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. Xenophobes tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of assimilation, and see this as harmful.\n\nThe obstacle to ethnoconvergence is ethnocentrism, which is the view that one's culture is of greater importance than another's. Ethnocentrism often takes different forms, as it is a highly personal bias, and manifests itself in countless aspects of culture. Religion, or belief, is the prime ethnocentric divider. Second is custom, which may overlap religion. With the adherence to each distinct component, comes the repulsion of the other. In most regions, ethnic divides are binary, meaning only two distinct cultures are present, each seeing the other as foreign. Many, however make the point that the binary example is the exception, and the norm is far more dynamic.\n\nEthnicity can be divided into two distinct areas, as they relate to ethnoconvergence: Utilitarian traits, and traditional customs.\n\nReligion, on the other hand, is a highly personal and attached part of culture. However, religion does not neatly correspond with ethnic identity. In many cosmopolitan societies, religion is everything—social, utilitarian, intellectual, political; from the point of view of people of immersed cultures; The very concept of ethnicity and its distinctions is incongruous to their immersed concepts.\n\nIn many societies, such as in those in Europe, languages are considered a significant component of ethnic values. This does not mean that most Europeans reject learning other languages. Quite the contrary, Europeans are often polyglots, and may label other individuals by their ethnicities; practical means of distinguishing cultures may resemble tendencies similar to ethnocentrism.\n\nHowever, the political and cultural significance of regional or national languages are retained because these polyglots conform to the linguistic norms of the place they visit—doing \"as the Romans do\". Thus, conforming to the \"ethnic integrity\" of the region.\n\nIt has even become a cliché that \"to learn a new language is to adopt a new soul\". There are many other examples of the essential significance of language. In pre-Russian Siberia, Tatar-Mongol colonists in the Taiga often recognized indigenous speakers of Turkic languages as their \"own people\" and non-Turkic groups as \"foreigners\", despite these indigenous groups having a similar level of material culture, and sharing much of a primitive culture with tribes foreign to the Muslim-Buddhist Tatar-Mongols.\n\nIn October 2011, U.S. communications agency Bromley launched a new model/strategy utilizing transcultural sociological theory as a means to segment and 'make sense' of the changing American cultural landscape. Returning to classic social science as a solution, Bromley has embraced the anthropological approach put forward by thinkers like Fernando Ortiz as a way to account for ethnicity and language without being limited by them as a way for viewing the world.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7168931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7168931", "title": "Use of force continuum", "text": "Use of force continuum\n\nA use of force continuum is a standard that provides law enforcement officers and civilians with guidelines as to how much force may be used against a resisting subject in a given situation. In some ways, it is similar to the U.S. military's escalation of force (EOF). The purpose of these models is to clarify, both for law enforcement officers and civilians, the complex subject of use of force. They are often central parts of law enforcement agencies' use of force policies. Various criminal justice agencies have developed different models of the continuum, and there is no universal or standard model. Generally, each different agency will have their own use of force policy. Some agencies may separate some of the hand-to-hand based use of force. For example, take-downs and pressure point techniques may be one step before actual strikes and kicks. Also, for some agencies the use of aerosol pepper spray and electronic control devices (TASER) may fall into the same category as take-downs, or the actual strikes.\n\nThe first examples of use of force continuum were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s. Early models were depicted in various formats, including graphs, semicircular \"gauges\", and linear progressions. Most often the models are presented in \"stair step\" fashion, with each level of force matched by a corresponding level of subject resistance, although it is generally noted that an officer need not progress through each level before reaching the final level of force. These progressions rest on the premise that officers should escalate and de-escalate their level of force in response to the subject's actions.\n\nAlthough the use of force continuum is used primarily as a training tool for law enforcement officers, it is also valuable with civilians, such as in criminal trials or hearings by police review boards. In particular, a graphical representation of a use of force continuum is useful to a jury when deciding whether an officer's use of force was reasonable.\n\nWhile the specific progression of force varies considerably (especially the wide gap between empty hand control and deadly force) among different agencies and jurisdictions, one example of a general use of force continuum model cited in a U.S. government publication on use of force is shown below.\n\n\nThe U.S. Navy teaches a six-step model: Officer presence, Verbal commands, Soft controls, Hard controls, Intermediate Weapons, and Lethal force. Hard controls includes the use of tools such as hand-cuffs, while soft controls equates to empty hand above, describing techniques where the officer may engage a resisting detainee. When escalating, voluntary submission to cuffs is a viable way to prevent the need for empty hand submission techniques which place the officer and the detainee at physical risk. When de-escalating, hard controls (i.e.: cuffs and isolation in the rear seat of a cruiser) gives officers a reasonable and achievable goal after altercation with a detainee during which higher levels of force may have been required.\n\nIn all use of force continuum models, the actions of the subject is classified in order for the officer to quickly determine what level of force is authorized and may be necessary to apprehend or compel compliance from the individual. Listed below are examples of how subjects are classified.\nGenerally, the passive subjects and active resistors fall under levels 1–3 of the use of force continuum, while active aggressors fall under levels 4–6. The officers are trained to apply the proper measure of force within the continuum based on the actions and classification of the subject.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court, in the case of \"Graham v. Connor\", 490 U.S. 386, (1989), held that when engaged in situations where the use of force is necessary to effect an arrest, or to protect an officer's life or that of another, a law enforcement officer must act as other reasonable officers would have acted in a similar, tense, rapidly evolving situation. Such situations, once known as use of force incidents, are now commonly referred to as response to resistance incidents, because a law enforcement officer must respond to resistance offered by another. In order to determine what actions officers find reasonable in similar situations, some experts utilize surveys with law enforcement officers, who are provided with certain scenarios to determine what actions they would take if placed in certain situations. Knowing what other officers and citizens deem reasonable helps to craft a solid response to resistance continuum.\n\n\nMarine Corps\n\n"}

Dan Fodio was one of a class of urbanized ethnic Fulani living in the Hausa States in what is now northern Nigeria. He was a leader who followed the Sunni Maliki school of Jurisprudence and the Qadiri branch of Sufism..\n\nA teacher of the Maliki school of law, he lived in the city-state of Gobir until 1802 when, motivated by his reformist ideas and suffering increasing repression by local authorities, he led his followers into exile. This exile began a political and social revolution which spread from Gobir throughout modern Nigeria and Cameroon, and was echoed in a jihad movement led by the Fula ethnic group across West Africa. Dan Fodio declined much of the pomp of rulership, and while developing contacts with religious reformists and jihad leaders across Africa, he soon passed actual leader ship of the Sokoto state to his son, Muhammed Bello.\n\nDan Fodio wrote more than a hundred books concerning religion, government, culture, and society. He developed a critique of existing African Muslim elites for what he saw as their greed, paganism, violation of the standards of Sharia law, and use of heavy taxation. He encouraged literacy and scholarship, for women as well as men, and several of his daughters emerged as scholars and writers. His writings and sayings continue to be much quoted today, and are often affectionately referred to as Shehu in Nigeria. Some followers consider dan Fodio to have been a mujaddid, a divinely inspired \"reformer of Islam\".\n\nDan Fodio's uprising was a major episode of a movement described as the Fulani hegemonies in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. It followed the jihads successfully waged in Futa Bundu, Futa Tooro, and Fouta Djallon between 1650 and 1750, which led to the creation of those three Islamic states. In his turn, the Shehu inspired a number of later West African jihads, including those of Seku Amadu, founder of the Masina Empire, El Hadj Umar Tall, founder of the Toucouleur Empire (who married one of dan Fodio's granddaughters), and Modibo Adama, founder of the Adamawa Emirate.\n\nDan Fodio was a Fulani descendant of a torodbe family that was well established in Hausaland. He was well educated in classical Islamic science, philosophy, and theology. He also became a revered religious thinker. His teacher, Jibril ibn 'Umar, argued that it was the duty and within the power of religious movements to establish an ideal society free from oppression and vice. Jibril was a North African Muslim \"alim\" who gave his apprentice a broader perspective of Muslim reformist ideas in other parts of the Muslim world. Jibril b. Umar was known as an uncompromising opponent of corrupt practices and a stuanch proponent of Jihad. He begain his intinerant preaching as a mallam in 1774-1775. Inspired by Jibril b. Umar, Uthman Dan Fodio criticized the Hausa Kingdoms for their unjust and illegal taxes, confiscations of property, compulsory military service, bribery, gift taking and the enslavement of other Muslims. Dan Fodio also criticized the Hausa rulers for condoning paganism, worshipping fetishes, and believing in the power of talismans, divination, and conjuring. He also insisted on the observance of Maliki Law in the commercial, criminal, and personal sectors. Uthman also denounced the mixing of men and women, pagan customs, dancing at bridal feasts, and inheritance practices contrary to Islamic Law.\n\nUthman was also very influenced by the Mushahada or mystical visions he was having. In 1789 a vision led him to believe he had the power to work miracles, and to teach his own mystical \"wird\", or litany. His litanies are still widely practiced and distributed in the Islamic world. Dan Fodio later had visions of Abdul-Qadir Gilani, the founder of the Qadari Sufi Brotherhood, an ascension to heaven, where he was initiated into the Qadiriyya and the spiritual lineage of the Prophet. His thological writings dealt with concepts of the renewer \"mujaddid and the role of the Ulama in teaching history, and other works in Arabic and Fulbe. Many people regarded him as the Mahdi (messiah) come in fullfilment of popular prophecies.\n\nDan Fodio broke from the royal court and used his influence to secure approval for creating a religious community in his hometown of Degel that would, dan Fodio hoped, be a model town. He stayed there for twenty years, writing, teaching, and preaching. As in other Islamic societies, the autonomy of Muslim communities under Ulama leadership made it possible to resist the state and the state version of Islam in the name of Sharia and the ideal caliphate.\n\nUthman Dan Fodio's appeal to justice and morality rallied the outcasts of Hausa society. He found his followers among the Fulbe and Fulani. The Fulbe and Fulani were primarily cattle pastoralists. These pastoralist communities were led by the clerics living in rural communities who were Fulfude speakers and closely connected to the pastoralists. The Fulani would later hold the most important offices of the new states. Hausa peasants, runaway slaves, itinerant preachers, and others also responded to Uthaman's preaching. His jihad served to integrate a number of peoples into a single religio-political movement.\n\nIn 1802, Yunfa, the ruler of Gobir and one of dan Fodio's students, turned against him, revoking Degel's autonomy and attempting to assassinate dan Fodio. Dan Fodio and his followers declared hijrah and fled into the western grasslands of Gudu, where they turned for help to the local Fulani nomads. Uthman's followers at this time entitled him Amir al-Mu'minin and \"sarkin muslim\" - head of the Muslim community. The rulers of Gobir forbade Muslims to wear turbans and veils, prohibited conversions, and ordered converts to Islam to return to their old religion. In his book \"Tanbih al-ikhwan ’ala ahwal al-Sudan\" (“\"Concerning the Government of Our Country and Neighboring Countries in the Sudan\"”) Usman wrote: “The government of a country is the government of its king without question. If the king is a Muslim, his land is Muslim; if he is an unbeliever, his land is a land of unbelievers. In these circumstances it is obligatory for anyone to leave it for another country”. Usman did exactly this when he left Gobir in 1802. Yunfa then turned for aid to the other leaders of the Hausa states, warning them that dan Fodio could trigger a widespread jihad.\n\nUsman dan Fodio was proclaimed \"Amir al-Muminin\" or Commander of the Faithful in Gudu. This made him a political as well as religious leader, giving him the authority to declare and pursue a jihad, raise an army and become its commander. A widespread uprising began in Hausaland. This uprising was largely composed of the Fulani, who held a powerful military advantage with their cavalry. It was also widely supported by the Hausa peasantry, who felt over-taxed and oppressed by their rulers. Usuman started the jihad against Gobir in 1804.\n\nAt the time of the war Fulani communications were carried along trade routes and rivers draining into the Niger-Benue valley, as well as the delta and the lagoons. The call for jihad reached not only other Hausa states such as Kano, Daura, Katsina, and Zaria, but also Borno, Gombe, Adamawa, Nupe. These were all places with major or minor groups of Fulani \"alims\".\n\nBy 1808 Uthman had defeated the rulers of Gobir, Kano, Katsina, and other Hausa Kingdoms.Usman Dan Fodio was defeated by Ibadan warlords in Yorubaland as far as the forest zone. After only a few years of the Fulani War, Dan Fodio found himself in command of the hausa state, the Fulani Empire. His son Muhammed Bello and his brother Abdullahi carried on the jihad and took care of the administration. Dan Fodio worked to establish an efficient government grounded in Islamic law. After 1811, Usman retired and continued writing about the righteous conduct of the Muslim religion. After his death in 1817, his son, Muhammed Bello, succeeded his as \"amir al-mu’minin\" and became the ruler of the Sokoto Caliphate, which was the biggest state south of the Sahara at that time. Usman’s brother Abdullahi was given the title Emir of Gwandu and was placed in charge of the Western Emirates, Nupe. Thus all Hausa states, parts of Nupe and Fulani outposts in Bauchi and Adamawa were all ruled by a single politico-religious system. By 1830 the jihad had engulfed most of what are now northern Nigeria and the northern Cameroons. From the time of Usman dan Fodio to the British conquest at the beginning of the twentieth century there were twelve caliphs.\n\nThe Sokoto Caliphate was a combination of an Islamic state and a modified Hausa monarchy. Muhammed Bello introduced Islamic administration, Muslim judges, market inspectors, and prayer leaders were appointed, and an Islamic tax and land system was instituted with revenues on the land considered \"kharaj\" and the fees levied on individual subjects called jizya, as in classical Islamic times. The Fulani cattle-herding nomads were sedentarized and converted to sheep and goat raising as part of an effort to bring them under the rule of Muslim law. Mosques and Madrassahs were built to teach the populace Islam. The state patronized large numbers of religious scholars or mallams. Sufism became widespread. Arabic, Hausa, and Fulfulde languages saw a revival of poetry and Islam was taught in Hausa and Fulfide.\n\nMany of the Fulani led by Usman dan Fodio were unhappy that the rulers of the Hausa states were mingling Islam with aspects of the traditional regional religion. Usman created a theocratic state with a stricter interpretation of Islam. In \"Tanbih al-ikhwan ’ala ahwal al-Sudan\", he wrote: “As for the sultans, they are undoubtedly unbelievers, even though they may profess the religion of Islam, because they practice polytheistic rituals and turn people away from the path of God and raise the flag of a worldly kingdom above the banner of Islam. All this is unbelief according to the consensus of opinions.”\n\nIn \"Islam outside the Arab World\", David Westerlund wrote: “The jihad resulted in a federal theocratic state, with extensive autonomy for emirates, recognizing the spiritual authority of the caliph or the sultan of Sokoto.”\n\nUsman addressed in his books what he saw as the flaws and demerits of the African non-Muslim or nominally Muslim rulers. Some of the accusations he made were corruption at various levels of the administration and neglect of the rights of ordinary people. Usman also criticized heavy taxation and obstruction of the business and trade of the Hausa states by the legal system.\n\nUsman dan Fodio was described as well past 6 feet, lean and looking very much like his mother Sayda Hauwa. His brother Abdullahi dan Fodio (1761-1829) was also over 6 feet in height and was described as looking more like their father Muhammad Fodio, with a darker skin hue and a portly physique later in his life.\n\nIn Rawd al-Janaan (The Meadows of Paradise), Waziri Gidado dan Laima (1777-1851) listed Dan Fodio's wives as:\n\nHis first cousin Maymuna with whom he had 11 children, including Aliyu (1770s-1790s) and the twins Hasan (1793- November 1817) and Nana Asma'u (1793-1864).

He was associated with Samastha Kerala Sahithya Parishath, the biggest forum for Malayalam writers at that time, for more than 10 years. He represented Kerala in the national poets' meetings held at Delhi (1951 and 1969) and Bangalore (1965). In 1970 he toured the Soviet Union.

The Second Notice included 9 time-series graphs of key indicators, each correlated to a specific issue mentioned in the original 1992 warning, to show that most environmental issues are continuing to trend in the wrong direction, most with no discernible change in rate. The article included 13 specific steps humanity could take to transition to sustainability.\n\nThe Second Notice has more scientist cosigners and formal supporters than any other journal article ever published. The full warning was published in \"BioScience\". To read a summary and endorse the warning, go to the 'activist arm' of the project.\n\nIn late 1992, the late Henry W. Kendall, a former chair of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) board of directors, wrote the first warning \"World Scientists' Warning to Humanity\", which begins: \"Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course.\" A majority of the Nobel Prize laureates in the sciences signed the document; about 1,700 of the world's leading scientists appended their signature.\n\nIt was sometimes offered in opposition to the Heidelberg Appeal—also signed by numerous scientists and Nobel laureates earlier in 1992—which begins by criticizing \"an irrational ideology which is opposed to scientific and industrial progress, and impedes economic and social development.\" This document was often cited by those who oppose theories relating to climate change.\n\nHowever, the Heidelberg Appeal offers no specific recommendations and is not an indictment of environmental science: \"We fully subscribe to the objectives of a scientific ecology for a universe whose resources must be taken stock of, monitored and preserved. But we herewith demand that this stock-taking, monitoring and preservation be founded on scientific criteria and not on irrational pre-conceptions.\"\n\nIn contrast, the UCS-led petition contains specific recommendations: \"We must, for example, move away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water. ... We must stabilize population.\"\n\n"}

It is one of the Gurage languages in the Ethiopian Semitic group. The Zay language has around 5,000 speakers known as the Zay, who inhabit Gelila and the other five islands and shores of Lake Zway in the southern part of the country.\n\nZay is an unwritten language. Most speakers are multilingual in Oromo, Amharic, and additional Gurage languages. The language is geographically concentrated around Lake Zway; specifically, in Herera, Meki, Ziway, and the five islands: Fundurro Island (Famat or Getesemani Island) the smallest island; Tsedecha Island (Aysut Island), next to the biggest island; Debre-Tsion Island, the largest island; Gelila Island; and Debre Sina Island. It is an endangered language, with speakers migrating to the mainland adopting the Oromo language, and increasing use of Oromo by the younger generations on the Zay islands.\n\nZay is 70% lexically similar with the Silt'e language, and 60% with Harari.\n\nThe word order of Zay is SOV (subject–object–verb). Attributive adjectives precede the nouns they modify. Possessives also precede nouns. Zay is a pro-drop language, with required subject-marking on the verb.\n\nZay has been greatly affected by contact it has had with the Oromo language. This contact has created a significant amount of lexical and grammatical change in Zay.\n\n\n"}
