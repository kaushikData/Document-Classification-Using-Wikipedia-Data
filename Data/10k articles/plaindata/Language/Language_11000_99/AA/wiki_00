It was discovered by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Thomas J. Allen in the late 1970s.\n\nA related and highly significant finding of Allen's was his identification of the key role of information gatekeepers. Often such interlocutors were poorly recognized by management and yet conveyed vital concepts from just the right people to just the right other people in the organization.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Allen undertook a project to determine how the distance between engineers’ offices affects the frequency of technical communication between them. The result of that research produced what is now known as the Allen Curve, revealing a strong negative correlation between physical distance and the frequency of communication between work stations. The finding also revealed the critical distance of 50 meters for weekly technical communication.\n\nThis finding was originally documented in Allen’s book, \"Managing the Flow of Technology\".\n\nWith the fast advancement of internet and sharp drop of telecommunication cost, some wonder about the application of the Allen Curve in today's corporate environment. In his recently co-authored book, Allen examined this question and the same still holds true. He says\n\nHe further explains\n\nWith the wide acknowledgment of importance of communication to innovation, the Allen Curve has been taught and cited in all management literature about innovation.\n\nIn the business world, this principle has had a very strong influence in many areas, such as commercial architecture designs (See for example the Decker Engineering Building in New York, the Steelcase Corporate Development Center in Michigan, the BMW Research Center in Munich, and the Volkswagen assembly and delivery center in Dresden), and project management.\n\n"}

She is most notable within linguistics and SLA for developing the \"Minimal Trees Hypothesis\" with Martha Young-Scholten, an \"important theory,\" where 'tree' is a metaphor of syntax for the branching structure showing how words of a phrase or sentence co-relate. The hypothesis concerns what aspects of a language learner's first language (L1) is carried over into the grammar of their second language (L2), in addition to mechanisms of universal grammar that allow new acquisition to take place.\n\nWhereas many researchers lean towards a 'Full Transfer' view in which all the L1 grammar transfers - i.e. the initial state of the L2 is the final state of the first - Young-Scholten and Vainikka have argued that only lexical categories (e.g. the noun phrase) are drawn from the L1, and that functional categories (e.g. the inflectional phrase that represents tense) do not; rather, the learner 'grows' new ones because they start their L2 acquisition with only a 'minimal' syntactic tree.\n\nSeveral competing accounts for the role of transfer and universal grammar persist in SLA; the Minimal Trees Hypothesis remains particularly controversial, and has been strongly critiqued in syntactic research on both empirical and conceptual grounds: some researchers argue that linguistic behaviour does not follow the model, and others claim that it is theoretically misconceived. For example, the idea that a component of language could be absent from the initial stage, so that the system selectively extracts only one part of the L1, is unacceptable to those who favour 'Full Transfer' rather than 'Partial Transfer'.\n\n\n"}

Macario (2015) lists the following divergent Apatani forms that do not reconstruct to Proto-Tani.\n\nIn Lower Subansiri district, Arunachal Pradesh, Apatani is spoken in 7 villages in Ziro valley, namely Hong, Hari, Biilla, Dutta, Hija, Mudang-Tage, and Bamin Michi (\"Ethnologue\").\n\nLike most endangered oral languages, Apatani did not have a standardized orthography, until recently, and there was some debate among the Apatanis on which script should be used to transcribe it. In view of this, Tanw Supuñ Dukuñ, the apex Tanw organization, recommended the constitution of the Apatani Language Development Committee (ALDC). The Apatani Cultural and Literary Society (ACLS) constituted the ALDC to recommend a writing system of the language. A year-long discussion and study by ALDC resulted in the recommendation of an alphabet based on Roman script. The recommendation was accepted by the ACLS and the administrative approval for its use was given by the Tanw Supuñ Dukuñ, or the Apatani Apex Council.\n\nLanguage development is gradual process and in case of Apatani (Tanw) Language the development has been unrestrained so far. Yet, Tanw (Apatani) People have been writing Tanw using English Alphabets. And what began as a means to communicate through writing has now grown into a writing system that has emerged as a simple and easy means of communication for Tanw people. Apatani (Tanw) People live at a beautiful tiny valley known to the world as Ziro, located at Central Arunachal Pradesh. The total indigenous population is merely around 60,000 strong but Apatanis (Tanws) are known for their fervor when it comes to preservation and promotion of their unique culture that they closely share with their surrounding Tribes belonging to same Tani Group.\n\nCurrently, there are some positive initiatives with regard to Tanw Language development. The most relevant ones are revision project by Popi Sarmin Society (the pioneer in Tanw Script development), Apatani-English Dictionary and Talking Apatani Dictionary. There are some differences on usage of some basic symbols and their usage. However, these developments are positive sign and they are giving momentum to public awareness regarding the urgent need for Tanw Language Development and Preservation.\n\nTanw words can be written meaningfully using English consonants and vowels \"as is\". Currently, the writing system is under rapid development and there are various proposals that has been put forward and active research work is ongoing. In the meantime, people may write using the system as proposed by the ALDC (Apatani Language Development Committee) or use the simplified system with minimum change and retaining English consonants, vowels and sounds. So far, the only government of Arunachal Pradesh approved Apatani Script (order No.EDA.41/96-97 Pt. dated Itanagar the 2nd Nov, 2010) is developed by the Popi Sarmin Society and KIIJE TANII AGUN CHINSA is being used for elementary third language studies at schools in Ziro.\n\nHowever, it is to be noted that as any language, Apatani or Tanw language is evolving while it interacts with various languages such as English, Hindi, Assamese, etc. and as such it may not be correct to conclude on any specific writing structure as of now. For Tanw language, it a work in progress.\n\nTanw Aguñ *\n\nApatani Talking Dictionary *\n"}

{"id": "1514878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1514878", "title": "Billing (filmmaking)", "text": "Billing (filmmaking)\n\nBilling is a performing arts term used in referring to the order and other aspects of how credits are presented for plays, films, television, or other creative works. Information given in billing usually consists of the companies, actors, directors, producers, and other crew members.\n\nFrom the beginning of motion pictures in the 1900s to the early 1920s, the moguls that owned or managed big film studios did not want to bill the actors appearing in their films because they did not want to recreate the star system that was prevalent on Broadway at that time. They also feared that, once actors were billed on film, they would be more popular and would seek large salaries. Actors themselves did not want to reveal their film careers to their stage counterparts via billing on film, because at that time working in the movies was unacceptable to stage actors. As late as the 1910s, stars as famous as Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin were not known by name to moviegoers. According to Mary Pickford's biography \"Doug and Mary\", she was referred to by the public as \"the Biograph girl\" in all of her films before 1905.\n\nBefore Mary Pickford, the public used to call Florence Lawrence the \"Biograph girl\". In 1910 Lawrence was lured away from Biograph by Carl Laemmle when he started the Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP). Laemmle wanted Lawrence to be his star attraction, so he offered her more money ($250 per week) and marquee billing, something Biograph did not allow. She signed on; with the release of her first IMP film, \"The Broken Oath\", she became the first film star to receive billing on the credits of her film. From then on, actors received billing on film. Also originating during that time was the system of billing above and below the title, to delineate the status of the players. Big stars such as Pickford, Fairbanks, and Chaplin were billed above the title, while lesser stars and supporting players were billed below the title.\n\nDuring the era of the studio system, on-screen billing was presented at the beginning of a film; only a restatement of the cast and possibly additional players appeared at the end, because the studios had actors under contract and could decide billing. The studios still followed the billing system of the silent era.\n\nAfter the studio system's collapse in the 1950s, actors and their agents fought for billing on a film-by-film basis. This, combined with changes in union contracts and copyright laws, led to more actors and crew members being included in the credits sequence, expanding its size significantly. As a result, since the late 1960s, a significant amount of the billing is reserved for the closing credits of the film, which generally includes a recap of the billing shown at the beginning. In addition, more stars began to demand top billing.\n\nBilling demands even extended to publicity materials, down to the height of the letters and the position of names.\n\nBy the 1990s, some films had moved all billing to the film's end, with the exception of company logos and the title. Although popularised by the \"Star Wars\" series (see below) and used sporadically in films such as \"The Godfather\" and \"Ghostbusters\", this \"title-only\" billing became an established form for summer blockbusters in 1989, with \"Ghostbusters II\", \"Lethal Weapon 2\", and \"The Abyss\" following the practice. Occasionally, even the title is left to the end, such as in \"Avatar\", \"The Passion of the Christ\", \"Inception\", and the \"Dark Knight\" trilogy.\n\nThe order in which credits are billed generally signify their importance. While there are numerous variations, most opening credits use some variation of the following basic order. In the absence of opening credits, these roles will often be credited in reverse order at the beginning of the closing credits.\n\n\nThe name of the studio that is normally credited is the one that distributed the film. However, a studio may not necessarily be the party that produced it. Instead, a separate production company may have actually made the film or financed a substantial part of the film.\n\nDepending on their standing, the director may be granted an extra, prominent credit before the film's title (as in \"A Ridley Scott Film\"); this practice began with directors such as Otto Preminger, David Lean and John Frankenheimer in the mid-1960s. Sometimes the producer or writer may also get a possessory credit. Up until the establishment of the director's possessive credit, in the early 1970s, some directors were so highly regarded that they received what seems to be a producer's credit, even if they did not produce the film. Victor Fleming was one such director: his films usually featured the credit \"A Victor Fleming Production\", even when someone else produced the film. James Whale was similarly credited.\n\nDirector Kevin Smith refuses to use a possessory credit, such as \"A Kevin Smith Film\", feeling that a movie is made by everyone involved, and not the product of just the director.\n\nThe actors whose names appear first are said to have \"top billing\". They usually play the principal characters in the film and have the most screen time. Frequently, top-billed actors are also named in advertising material such as trailers, posters, billboards and TV spots.\n\nThe two or three top-billed actors in a movie will usually be announced prior to the title of the movie; this is referred to as \"above-title billing\". For an actor to receive it, he/she will generally have to be well-established, with box-office drawing power. Those introduced afterward are generally considered to be the supporting cast. Well-known actors may be given top billing for publicity or contractual purposes if juvenile, lesser-known, or first-time performers appear in a larger role: e.g., Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman were both credited before the title in \"Superman\" (1978), while Christopher Reeve, the then-unknown actor who played the titular character and protagonist, was not, even though Brando only appears in the introduction while Hackman was the main antagonist. Similarly in \"Apocalypse Now\", Brando was billed first though he only appears at the end as the film's chief antagonist, while Robert Duvall was billed second despite a brief supporting role that earned him an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor, and Martin Sheen who portrayed the main character was billed third.\n\nIt used to be common practice to give top billing based on a person's level of fame, regardless of the significance of their role in the film. For example, Marlon Brando received top billing in \"The Godfather\" (although he had less on-screen time than Al Pacino's character; Pacino was displeased that he was only nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar while Brando received the Oscar nod for Best Actor in a Leading Role), \"Apocalypse Now\" (see above), and \"Superman\" (also see above). Maximilian Schell was billed fifth in \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" after Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, and Marlene Dietrich, yet Schell went on to win the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In recent decades, however, the practice of giving top billing to a star actor has largely been discontinued especially if they only play a bit part; some major actors may have a cameo where they are only noted within the other cast during the end credits.\n\nIf an unfamiliar actor has the lead role, he may be listed last in the list of principal supporting actors, his name prefixed with \"and introducing\" (as Peter O'Toole was in \"Lawrence of Arabia\") However \"and introducing\" is now mostly used in feature films by a young actor (usually a child) who appears for the first time in a motion picture. Sometimes, he may not receive special billing even if his role is crucial. For example, the then-unknown William Warfield, who played Joe and sang \"Ol' Man River\" in the 1951 film version of \"Show Boat\", received tenth billing as if he were merely a bit player, while Paul Robeson, an established star who played the same role in the 1936 film version of the musical, received fourth billing in the 1936 film.\n\nIf more than one name appears at the same time or of a similar size, then those actors are said to have \"equal billing,\" with their importance decreasing from left to right. However, an instance of \"equal importance\" is \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974) starring Steve McQueen and Paul Newman. The two names appear simultaneously with Newman's on the right side of the screen and raised slightly higher than McQueen's, to indicate the comparable status of both actors' characters (this also features on the advertising poster).\n\nIf a film has an ensemble cast with no clear lead role, it is traditional to bill the participants alphabetically or in the order of their on-screen appearance. An example of the former is \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977), which featured 14 roles played by established stars, any one of whom would have ordinarily received top billing as an individual. The cast of the \"Harry Potter\" films includes many recognized stars who are billed alphabetically, but after the three principals who were initially child actors.\n\nIn the case of the Kenneth Branagh \"Hamlet\", there were many famous actors playing supporting or bit roles, and these actors were given prominent billing in the posters along with the film's actual stars: Branagh, Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, and Kate Winslet. In the actual film's credits, they (along with the other actors in the film) were listed in alphabetical order and in the same size typeface.\n\nIf an actor is not an established star, he or she may not receive above-the-title billing, or even \"star\" billing; they may just be listed at the head of the cast. This is the way that all of the actors were listed in the opening credits to \"The Wizard of Oz\"; Judy Garland, although listed first, was given equal billing to all the others, with the cast list reading \"with Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley,\" etc. F. Murray Abraham, a supporting actor at the time of \"Amadeus\", did not receive special star billing although he played the lead role of Antonio Salieri; his onscreen credit reads \"with F. Murray Abraham\", although his name does appear first in the cast.\n\nIn some cases, the position of a name in the credits roll can become a sticking point for both cast and crew. Such was the case on the sixties TV sitcom \"Gilligan's Island\", where two of the stars were only mentioned by name in the closing credits. In fact, the characters of The Professor (Russell Johnson) and Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) were the only ones whose mention in the opening theme song was abbreviated simply as \"the rest\" in the show's first season. Bob Denver, who played Gilligan, was so upset with this treatment that he reportedly told the producers that since his contract stipulated that his name could appear anywhere in the credits that he wished, he wanted to be moved to the end credits with his co-stars. From the show's second season, the studio capitulated, and moved Denver's co-stars to the opening credits of the show, and also changed the theme song's lyrics to include \"The Professor and Mary Ann\" instead of saying \"and the rest\".\n\nSometimes actors can become highly competitive over the order of billing. For example:\n\nSpencer Tracy was originally cast to play the lead opposite Humphrey Bogart in \"The Desperate Hours\" (1955) but when neither actor would relinquish top billing, Tracy withdrew and was replaced by Fredric March, who took second billing to Bogart. Bogart's role in the film had earlier been played on Broadway by Paul Newman but the young actor was not considered for the movie version since Newman, viewed by studios at the time as mainly a stage and television actor only beginning his movie career, was in no position to compete with Bogart. Spencer Tracy would also later back out of co-starring in the 1965 film \"The Cincinnati Kid\" when he learned he would have to take second billing behind the film's star Steve McQueen. The role Tracy had been cast in went instead to Edward G. Robinson, whom McQueen had idolized from childhood. Whenever it was pointed out to Spencer Tracy that he routinely took top billing in his films with Katharine Hepburn, he responded, \"It's a movie, not a lifeboat.\"\n\nClark Gable had a top billing clause written into his MGM contract and made three major films in the 1930s with Spencer Tracy in supporting roles (\"San Francisco\", \"Test Pilot\", and \"Boom Town\"), but when Tracy renegotiated his contract during World War II, he had the same clause included in his own contract, effectively ending the hugely popular Gable-Tracy team.\n\nIn the opening credits of \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957), Alec Guinness, who is generally regarded as the main character in the film, receives third billing, after William Holden (who demanded top billing) and Jack Hawkins (who does not even appear until halfway through the picture). In the closing credits, Guinness is billed second with Hawkins third.\nFor \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962), James Stewart was given top billing over John Wayne in the movie's posters and the previews (trailers) shown in cinemas and on television prior to the film's release, but in the film itself, Wayne is accorded top billing. Their names are displayed on pictures of signposts, one after the other, with Wayne's name shown first with his sign mounted slightly higher on its post than Stewart's. Director John Ford remarked in an interview with Peter Bogdanovich that he made it apparent to the audience that Vera Miles' character had never entirely recovered from an abortive romance with Wayne's gunslinging rancher because \"I wanted Wayne to be the lead.\" Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford used precisely the same billing formula for \"All the President's Men\" (1976), with Redford receiving top billing in posters and trailers while Hoffman was billed over Redford in the film itself.\n\nAs both Tony Curtis and Jerry Lewis wanted top billing for \"Boeing Boeing\" (1965), their animated names appeared in a spinning, circular fashion in front of an airplane engine's rotating nacelle. For the trailer, the circular animation of the two names was repeated and neither name was spoken aloud. For the posters, the names made an X, Lewis' going up from the bottom left and Curtis' going down from the upper left.\nFor the film \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974), Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and William Holden all tried to obtain top billing. Holden was refused as his diminished star power was no longer considered to be in the league of McQueen's and Newman's. To provide dual top billing and mollify McQueen, the credits were arranged diagonally, with McQueen at the lower left and Newman at the upper right. Thus, each actor appeared to have top billing depending on whether the poster was read from left to right or top to bottom. Technically, McQueen has top billing and is mentioned first in the film's trailers; however, at the end of the movie, as the cast's names roll from the bottom of the screen, Newman's name is fully visible first, giving him top billing in the closing credits. This was the first time that this type of \"staggered but equal\" billing had been used for a movie, although the same thing had been discussed for the same two actors five years earlier when McQueen was going to play the Sundance Kid in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1969). McQueen ultimately passed on the part and was replaced by Robert Redford, who did not enjoy McQueen's status and took second billing to Newman. Today, it has become understood that whoever's name appears to the left has top billing, but this was by no means the case when \"The Towering Inferno\" was produced. This same approach has often been used subsequently, including 2008's \"Righteous Kill\" starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.\n\nIn \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\" (1990), F. Murray Abraham asked for above-title billing. This was rejected as too many other stars were getting it (Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Melanie Griffith). Thus, Abraham asked for his name to be completely removed, even from the closing credits. That same year, Raúl Juliá requested above the title billing alongside Robert Redford and Lena Olin for the drama \"Havana\". When the producers rejected this, he decided to go uncredited. Eleven years later, Don Cheadle did exactly the same thing when his name wasn't allowed to appear above the title in \"Ocean's Eleven\" (2001), presumably because his name would have alphabetically preceded George Clooney's and, unlike with the later sequels, the cast above the title was presented alphabetically (Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy García, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts). Cheadle removed his name from the credits. The producers apparently wanted Clooney, not Cheadle, to be the first name a casual viewer of the advertising would see.\n\nIn \"Batman\" (1989), Jack Nicholson received top billing (along with the highest salary and a percentage of profits) as an established actor, even though Michael Keaton played the titular character while Nicholson's Joker was the main antagonist.\n\nIn the film \"Miami Vice\" (2006), Colin Farrell originally received top billing. However, after Jamie Foxx won an Academy Award he requested top billing and received it despite his role actually being much smaller than Farrell's. Foxx's name appears first in the opening credits, while Farrell still receives top billing in the closing credits.\n\nIn a commercial for \"Michael and Michael Have Issues\" (2009), the aforementioned characters mock-argue over who gets top billing for their show.\n\nAn actor may receive \"last billing\", which usually designates a smaller role played by a famous name. They are usually credited after the rest of the lead cast, prefixed with \"and\" (or also \"with\" if there is more than one, as Samuel L. Jackson was in the latter two \"Star Wars\" prequels). In some cases, the name is followed by \"as\" and then the name of the character (sometimes called an \"and-as\" credit). This is not the case if that character is unseen for most of the movie (see Ernst Stavro Blofeld).\n\nAn early last billing credit in a film's opening simply listed a question mark (?) as portraying the monster in the 1931 classic \"Frankenstein\", which still lists it that way today, although the reissued prints seen today add actor Boris Karloff to the end credit listings, as the film made him a huge star such that the credits of the film's first sequel \"The Bride of Frankenstein\" credits him only by his last name.\n\nOne of the first \"and-as\" credits was afforded Spencer Tracy (as Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle) in the 1944 World War II film \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\", since another top box office star of the time, Van Johnson, had top billing and Tracy was too big a star to receive second billing. In all the posters and the screen credits, Tracy's name is displayed in larger letters than Johnson's.\n\nSome films have both an \"and-as\" credit and a separate last billing credit, such as the Irwin Allen 1978 disaster film \"The Swarm\", the opening credits of which, after listing an already large cast of stars, concludes with \"Fred MacMurray as Clarence ... and Henry Fonda\".\n\nAn actor may go uncredited, and not be listed in either or both of the opening and closing credits. Reasons for this may vary. Some examples include:\n\n\nOther unbilled roles feature famous actors or actresses who pop up in a movie as a face in a crowd, a man on a bench, or other 'background' characters, who are given screen time for a brief, but recognizable, moment, such as Bing Crosby and Bob Hope momentarily appearing in a circus audience during \"The Greatest Show on Earth\". They can be recognized, but sometimes are not credited for financial reasons – if they receive credit, they would be due payment commensurate with their fame.\n\nWriting credits for films and TV shows written under the jurisdiction of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) uses the WGA screenwriting credit system. For writers who belong to the WGA, the writing credits affect reputation, union membership, and income. Under the rules, the film producer must first submit the proposed writing credits for the project to both the WGA and all the participating writers. If any participating writer objects to the proposed credits, it then enters arbitration, with the WGA being the final arbiter.\n\nThe WGA rules help dictate whether a screenplay should be classified as \"original\" or is instead based on another source. If based on another source, an additional \"Based on a book/play/other source by\" is generally required. In the case of a sequel to the film, the credited writers of the original motion picture may be entitled to a \"Based on characters created by\" credit.\n\nThe WGA's rules also outlines when credits can be apportioned separately for the story, and for the screenplay itself when all writers were not equally involved in the creation of both. When the same writers are entitled to both \"Screenplay by\" and \"Story by\" credit, they will instead by listed under one \"Written by\" credit.\n\nFor writing teams of two, they are credited as one, separated on the credits by an ampersand (\"X & Y\"). If each works independently on the script (the most common system), they are separated by an \"and\". If more than two persons worked on the screenplay, the credits may read something like \"screenplay by X & Y and Z and W\", where X and Y worked as a team, but Z and W worked separately.\n\nThe WGA system also puts limits on the number of writers: on films, \"Screenplay by,\" \"Teleplay by,\" and \"Written by\" credit each can list no more than three writers (or writing teams).\n\nIf the main credits occur at the beginning, then the director's name is last to be shown before the film's narrative starts, as a result of an agreement between the DGA and motion picture producers in 1939. However, if all billing is shown at the end, his/her name will be displayed first, immediately followed by the writing credits.\n\n\nThe \"billing block\" is the \"list of names that adorn the bottom portion of the official poster (or 'one sheet', as it is called in the movie industry) of the movie\". In the layout of film posters and other film advertising copy, the billing block is usually set in a highly condensed typeface (one in which the height of characters is several times the width).\n\nBy convention, the point size of the billing block is 15 to 35 percent of the average height of each letter in the title logo. Typefaces used include Univers 39, Univers 49, and Bee. Inclusion in the credits and the billing block is generally a matter of detailed contracts between Hollywood labor unions representing creative talent and the producer or film distributor. The labor union contracts specify minimum requirements for presenting actors, writers and directors. But star talent is free to individually negotiate larger name presentations, such as when a star actor or director has his or her name above a movie’s title. The union contracts also cover billing blocks in trailers, outdoor billboards, TV commercials, newspaper advertising and online advertising. Using a condensed typeface allows the heights of the characters to meet contractual constraints while still allowing enough horizontal space to include all the required text.\n\n\nSpecific references:\n\nGeneral references:\n"}

It is spoken by the Bororo, hunters and gatherers in the Central Mato Grosso region of Brazil.\n\nBororo has a mid-sized phonemic inventory of seven vowels and fifteen consonants. Orthographic representations, when they differ from IPA, are shown in angle brackets (all from Nonato 2008, based on Americanist transcription).\n\nThe vowel system of Bororo is somewhat cross-linguistically unusual in that it distinguishes roundedness only in its back vowels (although Crowell (1979) analyzes these as underlyingly central).\nThe mid vowels /e ɤ o/ alternate with the open-mid (or \"lax\") vowels [ɛ ʌ ɔ] in apparent free variation.\n\nThe unrounded back vowels /ɯ ɤ/ become central [ɨ ɘ] word-finally. Furthermore, [ɘ] (i.e. word-final /ɤ/) is not distinguished from, and often surfaces as, front [ɛ]. As a result, /ɤ/ and /e/ are at least partially merged word-finally.\n\nBororo has a rich inventory of twelve diphthongs:\n\nAll pure vowels can also occur long, i.e. as /iː eː ɯː ɤː uː oː aː/. In contrast to other languages with phonemic vowel length, however, these are quite rare, and there seems to be no reason to distinguish long vowels from same-vowel sequences.This is evidenced by the mandatory lengthening of monosyllables, where the vowel of a monosyllable is repeated to form a long vowel: for example, /ba/ \"village\" becomes /baa̯/ [baː].\n\nUnusually for a South American language, Bororo has no phonemic fricatives.\n\nThe velar stop /k/ becomes aspirated [kʰ] before nonback vowels /a e i/; the labiovelar approximant /w/ becomes labiodental [ʋ] in the same environment. Plain and labialized velar stops / g kʷ ɡʷ/ merge as labialized [kʷ ɡʷ] before rounded vowels /u o/. The voiced velar stop /g/ lenites to fricative [ɣ] between vowels.\n\nThe canonical syllable structure in Bororo is (C)V: that is, a mandatory vowel nucleus (or diphthong), optionally preceded by a single onset consonant. Aside from unmodified loanwords from Portuguese (which are quite common, and becoming more so), Bororo syllables never have onset consonant clusters or codas.\n\nStress in Bororo occurs generally (again with the exception of unmodified Portuguese loanwords) on the penultimate mora. Since diphthongs contain two morae, this means that a diphthong in either penultimate or final position will generally be stressed: [ˈbai̯ɡa] \"bow\", [kaˈnao̯] \"pimple, scale\". Before compounding, however, diphthongs are reanalyzed as a monomoraic syllable, and stress is assigned again to the penultimate syllable of the whole compound: [keˈrakae̯] \"finger\", from /kera/ \"hand\" and /kae̯/ \"digit\".\n\nBororo has a process of stem-initial mutation. When a stem (whether a noun, verb, or preposition) beginning in a consonant takes on a prefix itself containing a consonant, the stem-initial consonant is voiced; for example, \"kodu\" \"to go\" becomes \"ikodu\" \"I go\" with the first person singular (prefix \"i-\") but \"pagodu\" \"we go\" in first person plural inclusive (prefix \"pa\"-). In addition, /b/ becomes /w/ and /dʒ/ becomes /j/ when following a prefix, regardless of whether the latter has a consonant or not: \"bogai\" \"for\" becomes \"iwogai\" \"for me\". Stems beginning with /d g m n r j w/ do not undergo any change. This process is part of a wider harmony restriction in Bororo, rare among the world's languages: no word (excluding clitics and compounds) may contain more than one voiceless obstruent.\n\nMeanwhile, a stem beginning in a vowel requires the insertion of a \"thematic\" consonant to attach a prefix. The consonant used varies both by the prefix and the stem-initial vowel: the first-person singular, first-person plural exclusive, and third-person plural prefixes insert the thematic consonant -\"t-/-d\"- before stems beginning in \"a-\" or \"o-\", while all other combinations (i.e. other personal prefixes or stem-initial \"i-\"; no native stems begin in \"e-\" or \"u-\") insert \"-k-/-g-.\" For example, whereas \"ore\" \"children\" becomes \"i-t-ore\" \"my children\", \"iwögü\" \"steal\" becomes \"i-k-iwögü\" \"I steal\". A few irregular stems which would be expected to take \"-t-/-d-\" instead take \"-n-\": \"oika\" \"anxiety\" becomes \"inoika\" \"my anxiety\", rather than \"*itoiga\" or similar. Finally, since vowel-initial stems never take a third-person singular prefix, no thematic vowel is inserted. This process is summarized in the table below.\nBororo, like most languages of South America, is synthetic and agglutinative (albeit with some degree of fusion). However, it cannot strictly be labelled \"polysynthetic\"; it does not make use of incorporation or any other means of particularly extensive derivation. Nominal morphology is fairly simple - on a level comparable with modern Romance languages - and verbal morphology, while somewhat more complex, cannot exceed three or four affixes on any given verb, in sharp contrast to the better-known \"polysynthetic\" languages of the Americas such as Nahuatl or Mohawk.\n\nSix basic word classes exist in Bororo: nouns and verbs (both open classes) and conjunctions, postpositions, adverbs, and pronouns (all closed). Note that there is no independent class of adjectives; the functions of adjectives in European languages are filled by verbs or nouns in Bororo. This section provides an overview of Bororo morphology as organized by these classes.\n\nThere is no category of obligatory nominal affixes in Bororo; a noun phrase may therefore be composed of a single unmarked root.\n\nMost nouns are pluralized by means of a plural suffix, whose most common allomorph is \"-doge\": \"arigao\" \"dog\" pluralizes to \"arigao-doge\" \"dogs\". The other allomorphs are \"-e\" (mainly following names of animals, e.g. \"juko-e\" \"monkeys\"), \"-mage\" (mainly following kinship terms, e.g. \"i-rago-mage\" \"my grandchildren\") and -\"ge\" (mainly following pronouns, e.g. \"ema-ge\" \"they\"). In addition, there is a \"zero morpheme\" \"*bo-\" which can occur only with the plural suffix \"-e\", meaning \"things\" or \"people\", hence the Bororos' own term for themselves \"Boe.\"\n\nSome nouns, however, are basically plural and require a marked singular suffix \"-dü.\" These generally refer to human beings; examples include \"barae\" \"white people\" (\"baraedü\" \"a white person\") and \"ime\" \"men\" (\"imedü\" \"a man\").\n\nDiminution is a productive process in Bororo. The diminutive suffix is -\"rogu\"; \"awagü\" \"cobra\" therefore may become \"awagü-rogu\" \"little cobra\" (Portuguese \"cobrinha\"). This has the allomorph \"-kügüre\" when attached to a plural noun: \"awagoe\" \"cobras\" (an irregular plural) becomes \"awagoe-kügüre\" \"little cobras\".\n\nBororo has no obligatory marking of grammatical gender. Many distinctions made by noun gender in Portuguese and other languages with the category are simply made by suppletive forms in Bororo, as in \"marido /\" \"oredüje\" \"husband / wife\" (Portuguese \"esposo / esposa\"), or by compounding with the nouns \"imedü\" \"man\" and \"aredü\" \"woman\" - hence \"tapira imedü\" \"bull\" and \"tapira aredü\" \"cow\" from \"tapira\" \"cattle\". However, there is also a feminine derivative suffix \"-do\", which is used with personal names and demonstratives: \"awü\" \"this\", \"awü-do\" \"this (woman)\".\n\nBororo uses postpositions rather than prepositions. Notably, these postpositions may be inflected with the same set of bound pronouns as verbs and inalienable possession; for example, \"ae\" \"to, toward\" can become \"et-ai\" \"to them\".\n\nOne postposition, \"ji\", is used to establish the nominal focus of a sentence - what Crowell (1979) refers to as \"range or referent\". In some cases, this functions very similarly to focusing prepositions in English: \"e-mago-re tori ji, \"they talked about the mountains\". However, the range of ambitransitive verbs in Bororo is much narrower (if indeed ambitransitives exist at all) than in English, and so several verbs which are transitive in English require focusing with \"-ji\" in Bororo: \"imedü jorüdü-re karo ji \"the men ate the fish\" (compare \"a-jorüdü-re\" \"you ate\"). These verbs - further examples of which are \"ra\" \"sing\", \"aidü\" \"want\", and \"rö\" \"do\" - function exactly as any other intransitive verb in Bororo.\n\nBororo has three degrees of deictic distance: near (\"a-\"), medium (\"no-\"), and distant (\"ce-\"). To modify a noun, these must precede the relative marker \"-wü\": a-wü imedü\" \"this man\", ce-wü imedü\" \"that man (over there)\". Since Bororo lacks articles, these occasionally take their place, but not nearly as frequently as true articles are used in English or Portuguese.\n\nLike many indigenous languages of South America, Bororo distinguishes inclusive and exclusive first-person plurals as well as alienable and inalienable possession. Inalienable possession is the only nominal category marked by prefixes; since these are identical with the pronominal prefixes of verbs, they are listed in the section \"Pronouns\". The table below provides a list of alienable possessors with the example word \"tori\", \"stone\":\nBororo verbal morphology is basically divided along lines of transitivity. Both transitive and intransitive verbs take the same set of bound pronouns to convey subjects and objects (e.g. i-reru-re, a-reru-re\" \"I danced, you danced\" / i-re a-reru-dö\" \"I make you dance\"), but each has an exclusive set of suffixes. \"Intransitive\" suffixes naturally apply to intransitive verbs, for which there is only one core argument - for example, the neutral aspect \"-re\" in \"i-reru-re\" - but also to the agent of a transitive clause, hence \"i-re a-reru-dö\"; meanwhile, \"transitive\" suffixes can only be applied to the main verb of a transitive clause - e.g. the causative \"-dö\" in \"i-re a-reru-dö.\" For this reason, the suffixes listed in this section cannot properly be called \"verbal\" suffixes alone; they are grouped in this section merely for convenience.\n\nAs mentioned above, these morphemes are suffixed either to the verb of an intransitive clause or to the agent of a transitive clause (A).\n\nBororo uses six suffixes, as well as a null suffix /-∅/, to convey grammatical aspect: three explicit grammatical aspects, divided into \"direct\" and \"indirect\" marking. These are the only strictly mandatory affixes of any kind; they vary in frequency, but all are productive and fairly common. All of these seven options are mutually exclusive.\n\nThe most common suffix in Bororo by far is the declarative or \"neutral\" \"-re.\" This suffix conveys a basic and unmarked tense, aspect, and mood for a declarative or interrogative sentence: \"kowaru kuri-re \"the horse is big\", \"kaiba kodu-re \"where did he go?\" Since it does not convey any tense information, it can be translated as either present or past in English: \"kowaru kuri-re\", for example, could be interpreted either as \"the horse is big\" or \"the horse was big\".\n\nThe stative suffix \"-nüre\" indicates that the action described by the verb is either ongoing or essential to the subject: \"et-ore e-ra-nüre \"the children were singing\", \"imedü pega-nüre \"the man is (essentially) bad\" (contrast with neutral \"imedü pega-re\" \"the man is bad\").\n\nThe \"purpose\" suffix -\"wö\" indicates that the action in question is the desired result of another (itself usually marked with neutral aspect). This usage always requires a nominalizer \"dü-\" and the postposition \"-bogai,\" \"in order to\": \"i-tu-re a-nudu-wö dü-bogai\" \"I left so that you could sleep\" (or \"... in order for you to sleep\").\n\nThis suffix is also used to indicate a hortative mood: \"pa-goage-wö karo-ji\" \"let's eat the fish\". This usage does not require another clause or the \"dü-bogai\" construction.\n\nRecent aspect is not conveyed with a suffix \"per se\" but rather the absence of a suffix; that is, a sentence without an aspect suffix is to be understood as occurring in the present or the recent past. Sentences using the other aspect markers may also be understood as present or recent, but only the absence of a suffix conveys this explicitly: \"imedü maru-∅\" \"the man is hunting\".\n\nAll three explicit aspect suffixes can also be rendered as indirect, meaning that the action they describe was itself described in speech or thought - corresponding broadly to the subjunctive in European languages. Verbs marked as indirect therefore always follow another verb (again usually in the neutral aspect): \"imedü ako-re awagü pega-ye,\" \"the man said that the cobra was bad / mean\". However, direct suffixes may also occur in this context; the indirect only adds an explicit layer of uncertainty or secondhand knowledge. For example, \"i-mearüdae-re a-mügü-ye means \"I thought you were there (but I didn't know)\", whereas \"i-mearüdae-re a-mügü-re would mean \"I thought you were there (and so you were)\".\n\nThere is no independent indirect affix. Instead, the three ordinary aspect suffixes change to apparently-related but historically obscure alternate forms when rendered as indirect. There is no indirect version of the recent aspect \"-∅\"; its meaning appears to be covered by the neutral indirect \"-ye\". The direct and indirect aspectual suffixes are compared below.\nThe negative suffix \"-ka- / -ga\"- simply negates a verb as in English, and may be followed by any aspect marker: \"a-reru-re\" \"you danced\" becomes \"a-reru-ka-re\" \"you did not dance\". This likewise forms a negative imperative without any special marking or fusion: \"a-reru-ka-ba\" \"don't dance!\"\n\nThe hypothetical suffix \"-mödü-\" indicates that the action is assumed (whether by the speaker or indirectly), but not definitely stated, to have taken place: \"u-tu-mödü-ka-re\" \"he probably did not go\", \"u-tu-mödü-ye\" \"(someone said that) he did not go\". This fuses with the neutral suffix \"-re\" to form \"-möde\": \"u-tu-möde\" \"he probably went\".\n\nThe inchoative suffix \"-gödü\" indicates that an action is beginning or has begun: \"meri rekodü-gödü-re\" \"the sun is beginning to set\".\n\nThese three suffixes apply only to verbs which carries the patient or object of a transitive clause (O).\n\nThe causative suffix \"-dö\" indicates that the subject of the verb causes the main object to perform an action, adding a level of valency: \"i-re a-tu-dö\" \"I made you go\". Theoretically, this suffix could embed new verbs indefinitely: \"i-re a-dö u-dö e-tu-dö\" \"I made you make him make them go\", but as in English it is rare to use more than two degrees.\n\nThe inceptive suffix \"-gö\" never occurs independently; it is the result of fusion with the causative. As a result, it has both a strictly inceptive meaning and a causative one, and therefore similarly adds a degree of valency. Several verbs which could be translated with single morphologically simple words in English are formed using this suffix: examples include \"rüdiwa-gö \"to teach\", literally \"to cause to begin to know\" and \"pemega-gö \"to prepare\", literally \"to cause to begin to be ready / good\".\n\nThe imminent suffix \"-yagu\" indicates that an action is or was about to happen, or alternatively that it is only \"nearly\" accomplished: \"a-re a-tu-yagu\" \"you were about to go\", \"e-re tü-yagu pu-reo-re\" \"they are almost alike\". This is technically a transitive sentence in Bororo, unlike in English; however, it is restricted entirely to coreferential arguments (i.e. the subject and object are identical).\n\nPersonal pronouns are divided into free and bound forms. Free forms are used to strongly mark a topic (marked by the \"fronting\" suffix \"-re:\" homophonous with but not identical to the declarative \"re-\"): imi-re i-tu-re\" \"(as for me,) I'm going\". They are also used in \"verbless\" sentences (for which see below): ema-re-o\" \"here it is / this is it\". Bound forms, meanwhile, are used to mark verb subjects and objects, inalienable possession, and postpositional inflection. The full list of free and bound forms (but not alienable possessors, for which see \"Possession\" above) is shown in the table below.\n\nAs seen above, a different set of suffixes applies to intransitive verbs and transitive subjects on the one hand, and verbs containing transitive objects on the other. It follows, therefore, that an intransitive clause must contain only a single verb of the former type (e.g. \"i-reru-re\" \"you dance\"), whereas a transitive clause must contain one of each. In the latter case, the \"subject\" word precedes the \"object-verb\": for example, \"a-re i-wiye\" \"you advised me\". The use of bound pronouns is required even if the sentence contains a full noun in either subject or object position: \"ime e-re areme e-wiye\", word-for-word \"the men they-did the women them advise\" - \"the men advise the women\".\n\nSince ambitransitive verbs are at least exceedingly rare in Bororo, however, and intransitives with postpositional focus are very common, the frequency of strictly \"transitive\" constructions is far fewer than that of English or Portuguese.\n\nYes-no questions (\"did/do...\" etc.) follow the same syntactical rules as declarative and imperative clauses in Bororo. Indeed, an interrogative clause may differ from a declarative one only by intonation: \"ature\" \"you went\", \"ature?\" \"did you go?\" However, a yes-no question may also be indicated explicitly by placing the clitic \"=na\" immediately after the questioned element: \"aturena?\" \"did you go?\" This clitic is mandatory after a question that contains only a single uninflected word, for example with pronouns: \"imina\"? \"me?\"\n\nBororo has six question words, all ending in the interrogative morpheme \"-ba\": \"kabo-ba\" \"what\", \"yogüdü-ba\" \"who\", \"kakodiwü-ba\" ’which', \"ino-ba\" ’how', \"kai-ba\" ’where' and \"kodi-ba\" 'why'. If the question element is modified in some way (e.g. by a preposition), the following modifier must itself be marked with \"-ba\": \"kabo-ba tabo-ba imedü maragodü-re\" \"what did the man work with?\"\n\nAs this example illustrates, Bororo makes use of wh-movement. An exception to this rule is \"pa\", an alternative form of \"kai-ba\" \"where\", which follows rather than precedes its subject: \"imedü pa?\" \"where is the man?\"\n\nUnlike in English, many well-formed Bororo clauses lack a verb entirely, in which case the first noun (the subject) takes the \"intransitive-ergative\" suffixes described above. These clauses usually correspond to those formed using the verb \"to be\" in English: pöbö-\"re wöe\" \"there is water here\", \"ema-re-o\" \"here it is\", etc. Crowell (1979) divides these clauses, which he calls \"copulative\", into \"existential\", \"equative\" and \"identificational\". Unlike clauses with verbs, these use free pronoun forms exclusively (with the exception of inalienable possession).\n\nExistential clauses denote the existence of their subject, optionally qualified by time and place. These are formed simply by applying the relevant inflection to the noun phrase: \"karo-re\" \"there are fish / fish exist\", \"karo-re pöbö\" \"tada\" \"there are fish in the water\", etc. If the subject of these clauses is modified by possession, this is taken as a full possessive statement: \"i-ke-re\", \"I have food\" (lit. \"my food is\").\n\nEquative clauses denote an identity between two noun phrases. These are formed by the juxtaposition of two noun phrases, only the first of which is inflected: \"imedü-re imi\", \"I am a man\". If these noun phrases are modified outside of inflection (e.g. are possessed by a full noun rather than a prefixed pronoun), they require the \"complex equative\" particle \"rema\" (singular) or \"remage\" (plural) to end the clause: \"Kadagare onaregedü-re Creusa rema\" \"Creusa is Kadagare's child\".\n\nIdentificational clauses are used to present an object within a particular space. These are formed identically to existential clauses, followed by the addition of one of a set of suffixes \"-o, -no,\" and \"-ce,\" which correspond directly to the deictic prefixes \"a\"-, \"no-\" and \"ce-\": \"karo-re-o\" \"here / this is a fish\".\n\n"}
{"id": "6138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6138", "title": "Conjecture", "text": "Conjecture\n\nIn mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found. Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995 by Andrew Wiles) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.\n\nIn number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" can satisfy the equation \"a\" + \"b\" = \"c\" for any integer value of \"n\" greater than two.\n\nThis theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of \"Arithmetica\" where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. The first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians. The unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century. It is among the most notable theorems in the history of mathematics and prior to its proof it was in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for \"most difficult mathematical problems\".\n\nIn mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that, given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a \"map\", no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Two regions are called \"adjacent\" if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions. For example, in the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share a point that also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not.\n\nMöbius mentioned the problem in his lectures as early as 1840. The conjecture was first proposed on October 23, 1852 when Francis Guthrie, while trying to color the map of counties of England, noticed that only four different colors were needed. The five color theorem, which has a short elementary proof, states that five colors suffice to color a map and was proven in the late 19th century ; however, proving that four colors suffice turned out to be significantly harder. A number of false proofs and false counterexamples have appeared since the first statement of the four color theorem in 1852.\n\nThe four color theorem was proven in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem. (If they did appear, you could make a smaller counter-example.) Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis, Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples exists because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true. Initially, their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the computer-assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand . Since then the proof has gained wider acceptance, although doubts remain .\n\nThe Hauptvermutung (German for main conjecture) of geometric topology is the conjecture that any two triangulations of a triangulable space have a common refinement, a single triangulation that is a subdivision of both of them. It was originally formulated in 1908, by Steinitz and Tietze.\n\nThis conjecture is now known to be false. The non-manifold version was disproved by John Milnor in 1961 using Reidemeister torsion.\n\nThe manifold version is true in dimensions . The cases were proved by Tibor Radó and Edwin E. Moise in the 1920s and 1950s, respectively.\n\nIn mathematics, the Weil conjectures were some highly influential proposals by on the generating functions (known as local zeta-functions) derived from counting the number of points on algebraic varieties over finite fields.\n\nA variety \"V\" over a finite field with \"q\" elements has a finite number of rational points, as well as points over every finite field with \"q\" elements containing that field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers \"N\" of points over the (essentially unique) field with \"q\" elements.\n\nWeil conjectured that such \"zeta-functions\" should be rational functions, should satisfy a form of functional equation, and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on the Riemann zeta function and Riemann hypothesis. The rationality was proved by , the functional equation by , and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was proved by \n\nIn mathematics, the Poincaré conjecture is a theorem about the characterization of the 3-sphere, which is the hypersphere that bounds the unit ball in four-dimensional space. The conjecture states: An equivalent form of the conjecture involves a coarser form of equivalence than homeomorphism called homotopy equivalence: if a 3-manifold is \"homotopy equivalent\" to the 3-sphere, then it is necessarily \"homeomorphic\" to it.\n\nOriginally conjectured by Henri Poincaré, the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a closed 3-manifold). The Poincaré conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each loop in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere. An analogous result has been known in higher dimensions for some time.\n\nAfter nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, Grigori Perelman presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on arXiv. The proof followed on from the program of Richard S. Hamilton to use the Ricci flow to attempt to solve the problem. Hamilton later introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called \"Ricci flow with surgery\" to systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way, but was unable to prove this method \"converged\" in three dimensions. Perelman completed this portion of the proof. Several teams of mathematicians have verified that Perelman's proof is correct.\n\nThe Poincaré conjecture, before being proven, was one of the most important open questions in topology.\n\nIn mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis, proposed by , is a conjecture that the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function all have real part 1/2. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis implies results about the distribution of prime numbers. Along with suitable generalizations, some mathematicians consider it the most important unresolved problem in pure mathematics . The Riemann hypothesis, along with the Goldbach conjecture, is part of Hilbert's eighth problem in David Hilbert's list of 23 unsolved problems; it is also one of the Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problems.\n\nThe P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is widely conjectured that the answer is no. It was essentially first mentioned in a 1956 letter written by Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann. Gödel asked whether a certain NP complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time. The precise statement of the P=NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper \"The complexity of theorem proving procedures\" and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute to carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.\n\n\nFormal mathematics is based on \"provable\" truth. In mathematics, any number of cases supporting a conjecture, no matter how large, is insufficient for establishing the conjecture's veracity, since a single counterexample would immediately bring down the conjecture. Mathematical journals sometimes publish the minor results of research teams having extended the search for a counterexample farther than previously done. For instance, the Collatz conjecture, which concerns whether or not certain sequences of integers terminate, has been tested for all integers up to 1.2 × 10 (over a trillion). However, the failure to find a counterexample after extensive search does not constitute a proof that no counterexample exists nor that the conjecture is true, because the conjecture might be false but with a very large minimal counterexample.\n\nInstead, a conjecture is considered proven only when it has been shown that it is logically impossible for it to be false. There are various methods of doing so; see Mathematical proof#Methods for details.\n\nOne method of proof, usable when there are only a finite number of cases that could lead to counterexamples, is known as \"brute force\": in this approach, all possible cases are considered and shown not to give counterexamples. Sometimes the number of cases is quite large, in which situation a brute-force proof may require as a practical matter the use of a computer algorithm to check all the cases: the validity of the 1976 and 1997 brute-force proofs of the four color theorem by computer was initially doubted, but was eventually confirmed in 2005 by theorem-proving software.\n\nWhen a conjecture has been proven, it is no longer a conjecture but a theorem. Many important theorems were once conjectures, such as the Geometrization theorem (which resolved the Poincaré conjecture), Fermat's Last Theorem, and others.\n\nConjectures disproven through counterexample are sometimes referred to as \"false conjectures\" (cf. the Pólya conjecture and Euler's sum of powers conjecture). In the case of the latter, the first counterexample found for the n=4 case involved numbers in the millions, although subsequently it has been found that the minimal counterexample is smaller than that.\n\nNot every conjecture ends up being proven true or false. The continuum hypothesis, which tries to ascertain the relative cardinality of certain infinite sets, was eventually shown to be undecidable (or independent) from the generally accepted set of axioms of set theory. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new axiom in a consistent manner (much as we can take Euclid's parallel postulate as either true or false).\n\nIn this case, if a proof uses this statement, researchers will often look for a new proof that \"doesn't\" require the hypothesis (in the same way that it is desirable that statements in Euclidean geometry be proved using only the axioms of neutral geometry, i.e. no parallel postulate.) The one major exception to this in practice is the axiom of choice—unless studying this axiom in particular, the majority of researchers do not usually worry whether a result requires the axiom of choice.\n\nSometimes a conjecture is called a \"hypothesis\" when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture from number theory that (amongst other things) makes predictions about the distribution of prime numbers. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on the truth of this conjecture. These are called \"conditional proofs\": the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.\n\nThese \"proofs\", however, would fall apart if it turned out that the hypothesis was false, so there is considerable interest in verifying the truth or falsity of conjectures of this type.\n\nKarl Popper pioneered the use of the term \"conjecture\" in scientific philosophy. Conjecture is related to hypothesis, which in science refers to a testable conjecture.\n\n\n"}

Frege argued that many philosophical errors, especially those related to psychologism in the philosophy of logic and philosophy of mathematics, could be avoided by adhering carefully to the context principle. The view of meaning expressed by the context principle is sometimes called semantic contextualism. This view need not be contrasted with the view that the meanings of words or expressions can (or must) be determined prior to, and independently of, the meanings of the propositions in which they occur, which is often referred to as compositionalism.\n\nThe context principle also figures prominently in the work of other Analytic philosophers, such as Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, who were greatly influenced by Frege's work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12799449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12799449", "title": "Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters", "text": "Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters\n\nThe debate on traditional Chinese characters and simplified Chinese characters is an ongoing dispute concerning Chinese orthography among users of Chinese characters. It has stirred up heated responses from supporters of both sides in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and among overseas Chinese communities with its implications of political ideology and cultural identity. Simplified characters here exclusively refer to those characters simplified by the People's Republic of China (PRC), instead of the concept of character simplification as a whole. The effect of simplified characters on the language remains controversial for decades after their introduction.\n\nThe sheer difficulties posed by having two concurrent writing systems hinders communications between mainland China and other regions, although with exposure and experience a person educated in one system can quickly become familiar with the other system. For those who know both systems well, converting an entire document written using simplified characters to traditional characters, or vice versa, is a trivial but laborious task. Automated conversion, however, from simplified to traditional is not straightforward because there is not always a one-to-one mapping of a simplified character to a traditional character. One simplified character may equate to many traditional characters. As a result, a computer can be used for the bulk of the conversion but will still need final checking by a human.\n\nThe writer Ba Jin, in his essay \"Thoughts: Reform of Chinese characters\" (), urged caution in any reforms to the written Chinese language. He cited the inability of those educated in Hong Kong or Taiwan to read material published on the mainland, and vice versa, as a great disadvantage of simplified Chinese. He also cited the ability to communicate, not just with Chinese peoples of various regions, but also with people from across the Chinese cultural sphere — countries such as Japan and Vietnam — as a great advantage of the written Chinese language that should not be undermined by excessive simplification.\n\nProponents say that the Chinese writing system has been changing for millennia: it passed through the Oracle Script, Bronzeware Script, Seal Script and Clerical Script stages. Moreover, the majority of simplified characters are drawn from conventional abbreviated forms that have been used in handwriting for centuries such as the use of 礼 instead of 禮, and some simplified characters are in fact restorations of ancient forms that had become more complicated over time. For instance, the character for \"cloud\" was originally 云, but the character was borrowed to write a homophonous word meaning \"to say\". To disambiguate the two uses of the character, the \"rain\" radical (雨) was added on top when it meant \"cloud\", forming the current traditional character 雲. The homophonous word meaning \"to say\", however, has become archaic in modern Chinese, though 雲 continues to be used for \"cloud\". The simplified version simply restores 云 to its original use as \"cloud\".\n\nWhile some simplified characters were adopted from conventional abbreviated forms that have existed for a long time, those advocating the simplified forms often fail to point out that many such characters in fact had multiple vernacular forms out of which just one was chosen, arbitrarily, and then privileged by the designers of the simplified character scheme. Many of the changes have been found to be ideological, such as the removal of the \"heart\" (心) from the word \"love\" (愛) into the new character (爱) without heart. To some, the new 'heartless' love character is an attack on Confucianism, which emphasizes the virtues of filial piety and humanity in relationships so as to maintain a harmonious society. On the other hand, supporters of simplification claim that the use of the character 愛 to represent the meaning of \"love\" is a rather new invention and was not recorded in the \"Shuowen Jiezi\" (of course, still far more ancient than many of the modern simplified character innovations), implying a Han dynasty or later date for the creation of the modern traditional form. According to Duan Yucai's authoritative commentary of the \"Shuowen Jiezi\", which compiled philological information on Chinese characters and traced their origins, the character first used to write the word was 㤅, which was later supplanted by 愛. Supporters of simplification argue that the removal of the heart radical occurred in the context of calligraphy in ancient times and was not viewed in an anti-Confucian light. A variant form without the heart radical appears in the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" under the head character 愛. Moreover, the simplified form 爱 is well-attested in the semi-cursive script calligraphy from imperial times, appearing in the work of Sui dynasty calligrapher Zhi Guo (智果) and Emperor Taizong of Tang and has appeared in calligraphic works from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties.\n\nPro-traditional commentators argue that the changes through the history are almost exclusively alterations in writing styles, especially vernacular writing, and not in the fundamental structure of the characters—especially after the Qin standardization. They have alleged that simplified characters were arbitrarily schematized and then imposed by the PRC on its people with the intention of subverting and eradicating selected elements of traditional Chinese culture, in order to carry out what the PRC viewed as necessary revolutionary modernization. These critics point out that many of the fundamental characteristics underlying Chinese characters, including radicals as well as etymological and phonetic elements, were deliberately omitted in their simplified form at least partly for this reason (i.e. disrupting continuity with traditional Chinese culture). One frequently-cited example is the character for \"sage\" or \"holy\", 圣 in simplified and 聖 in traditional. The simplified character lacks the \"king\" radical (王), replacing it with \"soil\" (土). Supporters of simplification appeal to the fact that that 圣 was often used, in handwriting, as a simplified variant of 聖 long before the PRC itself came into being. The \"Shuowen Jiezi\" furthermore classifies 聖 as a \"xingsheng\" character with phonetic component 呈. Thus the origin of the character may have nothing to do with any cultural connection to kings or royalty.\n\nEven among supporters of simplification, some make the argument that Classical Chinese texts should not be printed in simplified Chinese because of the complexities involved in the use of \"tongjia\" (通假) or phonetic loan characters. Ancient texts for instance might use the character 女 (\"nǚ\", \"women\") when the character 汝 (\"rǔ\", \"thou\") is intended semantically because of their similar pronunciation in Old Chinese. The character 汝 came into use relatively late. The interpretation of ancient texts in often complicated by the presence of these phonetic loans, for which several very different meanings could be read. Generally, the more ancient the text, the more numerous the phonetic loans, since separate characters were slowly introduced as the written language evolved, in order to disambiguate these loans. The merging of several traditional characters into one simplified character (e.g., 願 (\"yuàn\", \"desire\", commonly used) and 愿 (\"yuàn\", \"honest\", archaic and rare) to 愿 (both meanings)) during simplification can be thought of as a modern introduction of phonetic loans that complicates an already complex landscape of \"tongjia\" characters appearing in classical texts, introducing the possibility of misinterpretation or errors in transmission or transcription. Personal names of historical individuals are especially problematic. For example, there are two Six Dynasties period generals whose names are 王濬 (206-286) and 王浚 (252-314), both of which are pronounced as \"Wáng Jùn\". However, according to the current PRC simplification scheme, the character 濬 is considered to be an obsolete variant of 浚, so to conform to standard orthography, these names should be written identically using 浚. Against this, proponents of simplified characters respond that it is uneconomical to introduce high school students, already burdened by schoolwork, to a new character set for the sole purpose of teaching the classical language. Moreover, history and language majors in colleges and universities can gradually learn to read texts set in traditional characters, as the need arises. Nevertheless, classical texts set in traditional Chinese can be hard to find in mainland Chinese bookstores. The Zhonghua Publishing House (\"Zhonghua Shuju\", 中華書局) and a couple of specialist scholastic publishers are the only publishers to routinely publish works in traditional characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Chinese characters are only still used primarily by those in Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong and many overseas communities, comprising a small minority of the Chinese-speaking population (~50 million people). However, they also remain in use in mainland China for artistic, scholarly and advertising purposes. Simplified Chinese has come to dominate the written form of Chinese used nearly all over the world, due to the size and rising influence of mainland China. The United Nations has also used simplified Chinese since 1973. Moving back to traditional characters on the mainland has the potential to be difficult, confusing, and time-consuming.\n\n\nThe long history of Chinese characters and the role of the Chinese Communist Party in the design and adoption of simplified characters means that there is often a strong political aspect to the debate on the usage of traditional and simplified Chinese characters.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the official Campaign of Simplification of Chinese Language has caused many controversial discussions in the general public to higher level of the government in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and amongst some international organisations.\n\nIn November 2007, scholars and representatives from Japan, Korea, mainland China, and Taiwan came to Beijing and joined the Eighth Annual International Conference of Chinese Language Study. The conference was conducted and hosted by the National Office of International Promotion of Chinese Language and Board of Language Usage & Applications of the Ministry of Education of China. Immediately after, Korean media reported that the scholars and representatives reached a few conclusions after long discussion in the conference. One of those conclusions was that scholars would be using Traditional Chinese characters to standardise 5000 common Chinese characters across the countries and would continue to allow the use of Simplified Chinese characters if there happened to have one across those different areas. However, Chinese officials claimed that they did not reach such an agreement but would like to see the harmonious coexistence of Traditional and Simplified Chinese. Still, to many, that was the approval from Chinese Government because they were no longer absolutely opposed to the use of Traditional Chinese.\n\nIn March 2008, a Mainland author, Wang Gan, published a review article on his personal blog about the possibility of the re-introduction of Traditional Chinese, \"What About Abolishing Simplified Chinese within the Next 50 Years?\".\n\nTwenty-one members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delivered a proposal to add Traditional Chinese characters to the primary school curriculum. The proposal was rejected by the Minister of Education, who explained, 'Our nation has its fundamental governing principles. [One of them, by law, is] to promote the usage of Simplified Chinese and Mandarin. This is the basic condition… Thus, we will not consider re-introducing Traditional Chinese education in our primary school curricula.'\n\nOn 5 July 2008, on his visit to Taiwanese writer Koarn Hack Tarn's home, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou promised that he would not introduce the usage of Simplified Chinese into the territories just because of the local newly passed policy to let Mainland tourists visit Taiwan but to provide side-by-side translation so that Mainland visitors could appreciate the aesthetic nature of Traditional Chinese. And he also told journalists that he wished all Chinese people would eventually be using Traditional Chinese in the near future.\n\nIn early 2009, the ROC (Taiwan) government launched a campaign to obtain World Heritage status for Traditional Chinese characters in a bid to preserve them for the future. At the Eleventh National People's Congress, a representative from Taiwan, Ms. Chen Jun, called for the Chinese government to support the world heritage campaign. She also suggested the introduction of Traditional Characters education into mainland primary and secondary education to improve passion for and understanding of traditional Chinese culture and language.\n\nDuring a March 2009 CPPCC meeting, member Pan Qinglin proposed that simplified characters should be abolished and Traditional Character usage reimplemented over the course of ten years. His proposal was widely criticized as frivolous.\n\nAt the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences China Studies Forum in April 2009, it was announced that some adjustments would be made to the simplified characters. Experts acknowledged that some of the earlier character simplifications were problematic and inhibited understanding. Academics expressed support for the concept of \"know traditional, write simplified\" and specifically rejected the idea of reintroducing traditional characters as too costly and impractical. They cited a survey of ninety-one top-ranked senior classical Chinese literature and Chinese language students from Beijing Normal University testing their ability to write Traditional Characters, which only three students passed.\n\n\nIn Taiwan, traditional characters are officially known as \"proper characters\" (), while most Chinese speakers outside Taiwan, whether using simplified or traditional characters, refer to traditional characters as \"complex characters\" ().\n"}

His early education began at Kamarfadia. After his matriculation, he joined Cotton College in Guwahati. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1924 after which he pursued Masters in English study. Most of the literary works of Neog were done during the period while, studying at Cotton College. Neog was selected to be the General Secretary of Assam Chatra Sanmelan and remained associated with it from 1921 to 1924. During that period he edited the mouthpiece of Chatra Sanmelan 'Janmabhumi' and 'Milan'. Dimbeswar Neog started his professional life as a teacher in the Sivasagar Government School on 19 April 1925. Later he earned his masters in Assamese in 1940 from Calcutta University.\n\nIn 1930, Dimbeswar Neog married Ajaleetora (Xuwonikon), the daughter of renowned writer and Dibrugarh district judge Benudhar Rajkhowa. Dimbeswar and Ajaleetora Neog were blessed with seven children. He died in Assam Medical College after a brief period of illness in 1966.\n\nNeog's contributions to the history of Assamese literature and language is impeccable.He had authored around 100 books. His works ranged from story, verses, novel, drama, history of literature and criticism to folk-literature. Neog is best known as a critic of Assamese literature. According to the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, two of Neog's works on Assamese literature \"made significant contribution to the development of critical assessment in Assamese literature on an academic plane.\" Neog's approach to literary criticism has, however, been criticized as being \"not entirely free of personal prejudice\" and \"occasionally vitiated by his biased analysis.\"\n\nIn 1965, Dimbeswar Neog presided over the 32nd session of Asom Sahitya Sabha in Nalbari.\n\nA memorial committee entitled 'Dimbeswar Neog Xuworoni Santha' (Dimbeswar Neog Memorial Committee) in honour of Dimbeswar Neog was formed at his residence in the year 1969 under the aegis of his eldest son Late Basanta Mangal Neog. Gradually, the committee was officially constituted with Dr.Bhupen RoyChodhury as its first secretary and the memorial meetings began to be organized on a public domain for the greater interest of the people. Since then, the committee has been annually organizing the memorial meetings on the 12 November, which is Neog's death anniversary.Prominent scholars and literary geniuses of the state have graced this yearly occasion from time to time as chief speakers, speaking about his invaluable contribution to Assamese literature as well as by being present as distinguished guests. Recitation of his poems, songs penned by him are also performed in these meetings as an ode to him. \nIn the year 1992, 'Dimbeswar Neog Xuworoni Santha' has been renamed to 'Dimbeswar Neog-Aajaleetara Neog Xuworoni Saurabh Samiti' to commemorate his better-half, Ajaleetara Neog, who had been closely associated with children's literature herself. The committee has been conducting art competitions among children from time to time in the memory of Ajaleetara Neog as well as Dimbeswar Neog.\nIn order to mark the glorious 45 years of this memorial committee, a special presentation has been screened at the yearly memorial meeting of 2014.\n\nClick here to view the documentary\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There are Nallala and Kadagattur inscriptions that refer to this dispute. However, Durvinita managed to grab the throne by virtue of his valour.\n\nDuring Durvinita's rule, the hostilities between the Pallavas and Gangas came to forefront and several pitched battles were fought by the two kingdoms. Durvinita defeated the Pallavas in the battle of Anderi. Though the Pallavas sought the assistance of the Kadambas to the north to tame Durvinita, the Gummareddipura inscription hails that Durvinita overcame his enemies at Alattur, Porulare and Pernagra. It is possible that these victories enabled him to extend his power over Kongudesa and Tondaimandalam regions of Tamil country. He may have also made Kittur his capital.\n\nDurvinita was a clever king. In order to keep the Pallavas at bay, he gave his daughter to Chalukya Vijayaditya or from the Nagara record to Pulakesi II, though the latter is unlikely owing to the difference in their eras. The Chalukyas were an emerging power at this time. When the Pallavas attacked the Chalukyas, he fought on the Chalukya side and cemented a long lasting friendship with the Chalukyas that lasted through the rule of both the Badami Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas and Kalyani Chalukyas, covering a period of over 600 years.The Gummareddipura and the Uttanur plates describe Durvinita as the \"Lord of Punnata\".\n\nThe early Gangas were worshipers of the Hindu god Vishnu. However Durvinita had a Jaina guru called Pujyapada and his court was adorned with several Jain scholars. This tolarance was common among later Ganga kings, who actually took to Jainism in the later centuries. Durvinita was an able warrior as well as a man of letter and the fine arts. Kavirajamarga, the 850 CE Kannada classic hails him as one of the early writers in Kannada language prose, though his Kannada writings are not available. The renowned Sanskrit poet Bharavi is known to have visited the Western Ganga court during this period. Durvinita wrote a commentary on the fifteenth \"canto\" (chapter) of Bharavi's \"Kiratarjuniya\". He translated into Sanskrit \"Vaddakatha\" or \"Brihatkatha\" written originally by Gunadya in the Prakrit language. He also authored a writing called \"Sabdavatara\". His prowess in the battle field, knowledge of war instruments and arms, political science, medicine, music and dance has been eulogized in the Nallala grant inscription.\n\nDurvinita is mentioned as a notable Kannada prose writer in one of the works of Amoghavarsha.\n\n"}

The terms elizate (in Standard Basque) and elexate (in Biscayan) literally translate as \"church door\" (\"eliza\" \"church\" + \"ate\" \"door\"). The Spanish term \"anteiglesia\" translates as \"before [the] church\".\n\nThe peculiar name derives from the Basque custom where the family heads of a settlement connected to a particular parish would gather after mass at the entrance or portico of the church to make decisions regarding issues affecting their community. Their medieval history is closely linked to the emergence of the \"Batzar Nagusiak\" or \"Grand Meetings\", especially those of Biscay and Gipuzkoa (\"Juntas Generales de Vizcaya/Guipúzcoa\" in Spanish) and the establishment of parochial churches. Each \"elizate\" would elect a representative who would represent the \"elizate\" at a \"Batzar Nagusia\", so the \"elizate\" represents an early form of local democracy. These enjoyed considerable autonomy in decision-making from the higher administrative authorities.\nAn \"elizate\" was steered by a \"fiel sindiko\" (\"fiel síndico\" in Spanish), who would organise meetings and bear a makila as a sign of authority. A \"fiel\" was normally chosen for one year through a number of methods. Some were nominated by the outgoing \"fiel\", in some places the position of \"fiel\" would rotate through all farmholders of the \"elizate\" and in others the most recently married farmholder would be named \"fiel\". Each \"elizate\" was subdivided into smaller units called \"kofradiak\" (\"cofradías\" in Spanish, \"brotherhoods\") which corresponded to the individual boroughs of an \"elizate\".\n\nA group of elizates was a \"merindad\".\n\nThrough time \"elizates\" often became municipalities. In Biscay, during the time of the Lordship of Biscay (\"Bizkaiko Jaurerria\" in Basque, \"Señorío de Vizcaya\" in Spanish), the territory of all \"anteiglesias\" were referred to as Plain Land (\"Lur Laua\" in Basque, \"Tierra Llana\" in Spanish), as opposed to the more stratified cities. It was further incorporated into the administration. They became subject to the fueros which at the same time re-affirmed the status of nobility to all farmholders. This meant that unlike in most of feudal Europe, the farmers legally owned their land.\n\nAfter centuries of political change, very few \"elizate\" remain today, two of the most notable in Iurreta and Derio. In 1962, in Francoist Spain, the name of the \"elizates\" was changed to \"auzo\" (neighbourhood, district) and they were merged into municipalities. The current term, \"auzo\", is undistinguishable from the subdivisions of a city, which are called by the same term.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11511973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11511973", "title": "Empty category", "text": "Empty category\n\nIn linguistics, in the study of syntax, an empty category is an element that does not have any phonological content and is therefore unpronounced. Empty categories may also be referred to as covert categories, in contrast to overt categories which are pronounced. The phenomenon was named by Noam Chomsky in his 1981 framework. Some empty categories are governed by the empty category principle. When representing empty categories in trees, linguists use a null symbol to depict the idea that there is a mental category at the level being represented, even if the word(s) are being left out of overt speech. \n\nEmpty categories come in two major types: null DP's and null heads. These major categories can be broken down further: \n\n1) There are four main types of null DP's: NP-trace, WH-trace, PRO, and \"pro\". The types are differentiated by their two binding features: the anaphoric feature [a] and the pronominal feature [p]. The four possible interactions of plus or minus values for these features yield the four types of null DP's. \n\nIn the table, [+a] refers to the anaphoric feature, meaning that the particular element must be bound within its governing category. [+p] refers to the pronominal feature which shows that the empty category is taking the place of an overt pronoun. Having a negative value for a specific feature indicates that a particular type of null DP is \"not\" subject to the requirements of the feature. \n\n2) There are many types of null heads, including null determiners, null complementizers, and null tense. All null heads are the result of some movement operation on the underlying structure, forcing a lexical item out of its original position. \n\nEmpty categories are present in most of the world's languages, although different languages allow for different categories to be empty.\n\nNot all empty categories enter the derivation of a sentence at the same point. Both DP-trace and WH-trace, as well as all of the null heads, are only generated as the result of movement operations. Trace refers to the syntactic position which is left after something has moved, helping to explain how DP-trace and WH-trace get their names. What is meant by \"trace\" is that there is a position in the sentence that holds syntactic content in the deep structure, but that has undergone movement so that it is not present at the surface, or S-structure. Conversely, both \"PRO\" and \"pro\" are not the result of movement and must be generated in the underlying structure. In both the government and binding and minimalism frameworks, the only method of base-generation is lexical insertion. This means that both \"PRO\" and \"pro\" are held to be entries in the mental lexicon, whereas DP-trace and Wh-trace, and the null heads are not categories in the lexicon.\n\nThe empty category subclass called PRO, referred to as \"big pro\" when speaking, is a DP which appears in a caseless position. PRO is a universal lexical element, it is said to be able to occur in every language, and helps to account for non-finite embedded clauses. However, it's occurrence is limited: PRO \"must\" occupy the specifier position of an embedded, non-finite clause, such as in the example below:\n\nThis example does not use PRO, but instead, uses an overt pronoun (\"you\") in the specifier position of the embedded non-finite clause:\n\nThis example does use PRO, because instead of an overt pronoun, there is an empty category which is co-referenced with \"He\", appearing in the specifier position of the non-finite embedded clause:\n\nThe example tree to the right is the tree structure for this sentence, [He would like PRO to stay], and shows PRO surfacing in the specifier position of the TP in the embedded clause, and co-referenced to (referring to the same being as) the subject of the matrix clause. We can interpret this as the DP subject [He] having control over PRO. In other words, the meaning of PRO is determined by the meaning of DP [He] -- they are co-referenced. This is an example of a subject control construction, where the pronominal subject [He] is selected for by both the main verb [like] and the embedded infinitive verb [stay], thus forcing the introduction of an unpronounced lexical item (PRO) at the subject of the embedded clause, in order to fulfil the selectional requirements of both verbs. Alternatively, we see object control constructions when the object of the sentence controls the meaning of PRO. \n\nHowever, while the meaning of PRO can be determined by its controller (here, the subject of the matrix clause), it does not have to be. PRO can either be controlled (\"obligatory control\") or uncontrolled (\"optional control\"). The realization that PRO does not behave exactly like an R-Expression, an anaphor, or a pronoun (it is in fact, simultaneously an anaphor and a pronoun) led to the conclusion that it must be a category in and of itself. It can sometimes be bound, is sometimes co-referenced in the sentence, and does not fit into binding theory.\n\nNote that in modern theories, embedded clauses that introduce PRO as a subject are CPs. \n\n\"Little pro\" occurs in a subject position of a finite clause and has case. The DP is ‘dropped’ from a sentence if its reference can be recovered from the context; \"pro\" is the silent counterpart of an overt pronoun. Spanish is an example of a language with rich subject-verb morphology that can allow null subjects. The agreement-marking on the verb in Spanish allows the subject to be identified even if the subject is absent from the spoken form of the sentence. This does not happen in English because the agreement-markings in English are not sufficient for a listener to be able to deduce the meaning of a missing referent. \n\nChinese is an example of a pro-drop language, where both subjects and objects can be dropped from the pronounced part of finite sentences, and their meaning remains clear from the context. In pro-drop languages, the covert \"pro\" is allowed to replace all overt pronouns, resulting in the grammaticality of sentences that do not have a subject nor object that is overtly pronounced: \n\nThis example illustrates how a Chinese question might be asked with Zhangsan as the subject and Lisi as the object:\n\nBelow is an example of a response to the question above. Both subject and object are optionally pronounced categories. The meaning of the sentence can be easily recovered, even though the pronouns are dropped. (Round brackets indicate an optional element.)\n\nThe same point can be made with overt pronouns in English, as in the sentence “John said I saw him”. Where the chance of picking [John] as the antecedent for [him] is clearly greater than that of picking any other person.\n\nIn example 3), the null object must be referring to the matrix clause subject [Zhangsan] but not the embedded subject [Lisi], since of the Binding Theory states that it must be free. (Square brackets indicate that an element is covert (not pronounced), as in the second English translation.)\n\nIn certain syntactic environments (e.g. specifier VP and the specifier position of a TP which introduces a non-finite verb), case features are unable to be “checked”, and a determiner phrase must move throughout the phrase structure in order to check the case features. When this happens, a movement rule is initiated, and the structure is altered so that we hear the DP overtly pronounced in the position of the sentence which it has been moved to; a DP-trace is an empty category that appears at the original spot (the underlying position) of the DP, and stands for the syntactic space in the tree that the DP previously occupied. DP-trace is found in complementary distribution to PRO.\n\nUnderlying word order in the sentence \"Cheri seems to like Tony.\"\n\nSpoken form of the sentence \"Cheri seems to like Tony.\"\nThis English example shows that DP [Cheri] is originally introduced in the specifier position of the embedded infinitive clause, before moving to the specifier position of the matrix clause. This movement happens in order to check the features of the raising verb [seem], and leaves behind a DP-trace (tDP) in the original position of the DP. You can use the position of the DP-trace to identify where the DP is introduced in the underlying structure. \n\nDPs can move for another reason: in the case of Wh-questions. In English, these are questions that begin with <wh> (e.g. who/whom, what, when, where, why, which, and how); words that serve the same function in other languages do not necessarily begin with <wh>, but are still treated as “Wh-items” under this framework. The responses to these questions cannot be yes or no; they must be answered using informative phrases. Wh-items undergo Wh-movement to the specifier of CP, leaving a Wh-trace (tWH) in its original position. Just like for DP-movement, this movement is the result of feature checking, this time, to check the [+WH] feature in C. \n\nTo form a Wh-question in the example below, the DP [who] moves to the specifier of the CP position, leaving a Wh-trace in its original position. Due to the extended projection principle, there is DP movement to the specifier of TP position. There is also T to C movement, with the addition of Do-support. These additional movement operations are not shown in the given example, for simplicity. \n\nExample 5: Underlying order of words in the sentence “Who did Lucy see?” (Square brackets throughout example 5 indicate an empty category.)\n\nSpoken form of the sentence \"Who did Lucy see?\"\n\nThe tree to the right illustrates this example of WH-trace. Initially, the sentence is \"[CP] did Lucy see who,” which has an empty specifier position of CP, as indicated by square brackets. After the Wh-item [who] is relocated to the specifier position of CP, the empty position is left at the end, in the original position of [who]. What is left in its place is the WH-trace.\n\nA special relationship holds between the WH-item and the complementizer of a sentence:\n\nIn this example, the complementizer or the WH-item can have null categories, and one or the other may show up as null. However, they cannot both be null when the WH-item is the subject.\n\nAn important note to remember is that DP-trace and WH-trace are the result of movement operations, while \"pro\" and \"PRO\" must be base generated.\n\nNot only can DPs be empty; functional categories can be empty as well. Null determiners and null complementizers are empty categories that are the result of more recent research. These null heads are positions which end up being unpronounced at the surface level but are not included in the anaphoric and pronominal features chart that accounts for other types of empty categories.\n\nNull determiners are used mainly when the Theta assignment of a verb only allows an option for a DP as a phrase category in the sentence (with no option for an NP). Proper nouns and pronouns cannot grammatically have a determiner attached to them, though they still are part of the DP phrase. In this case, one needs to include a null category to stand as the D of the phrase as its head. Since a DP phrase has a determiner as its head, but one can end up with NPs that are not preceded by an overt determiner, a null symbol is used to represent the null determiner at the beginning of the DP.\n\nExamples of nouns that do not need a determiner:\n\nThe null determiners are subdivided into the same classes as overt determiners are, since the different null determiners are thought to appear in different grammatical contexts:\n\nØ\n\nØ\n\nØ\n\nComplementizerless environments (phrases which lack an overt C element) have often been attested in cross-linguistic data. In many cases, the complementizer is optionally present in a phrase:\n\nIn the following example, round brackets represent an optional element. In example (b), the optional element has been left out, leaving the C position empty. \n6a) She thinks (that) the cat is cute.\n\nThe existence of null complementizers is a phenomena that is currently still under debate in the linguistics community. There are two major theories that attempt to account for complementizerless environments: the CP Hypothesis and the IP Hypothesis. \n\nThe CP Hypothesis states that finite subordinate clauses that lack an overt C at the surface level contain a CP layer that projects an empty (or unpronounced) C head. \n\nSome evidence for this claim arises from cross-linguistic analyses of yes/no question formation, where the phenomenon of subject-auxiliary inversion (utilized in English) appears in complementary distribution with an overt complementizer question marker (for example, in Irish). Such work suggests that these are not two distinct mechanisms for yes/no question formation, but instead, that a subject-object inversion construction simply contains a special type of silent question marked complementizer. This claim is further supported by the fact that English does exhibit one environment — namely, embedded questions — that utilizes the overt question marked C “if”, and that these phrases do not employ subject-auxiliary inversion. \n\nIn addition to this, some compelling data from the Kansai dialect of Japanese, in which the same adverb can evoke different meaning depending on where it is attached in a clause, also points towards the existence of a Null C. For example, in both complementizerless and complementizer environments, the adverbial particle \"dake\" (“only”) evokes the same phrasal meaning:\n\nThe interpretation of both (a) and (b) is as follows: “among a number of things that John might have said, John said only that Mary got angry”\nThe interpretation of (c) is as follows: “John said that among a number of people that might have gotten angry, only Mary did.”\n\n   As demonstrated by (c), the adverb should evoke a different meaning than in (a) if it is attached to any item other than C. Because (a) and (b) yield the same interpretation, this suggests that the adverbial particle must be attached at the same spot in both clauses. In (a), the adverb dake is clearly attached to C; so even in the complementizerless environment (b), the adverb dake must still attach to C, thus pointing to the existence of a null complementizer in this phrase.\nThe IP Hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the complementizer layer is simply nonexistent in overtly complementizerless clauses.\n\nLiterature arguing for this hypothesis is based upon the fact that there are some syntactic environments under which a null C head would violate the rules of government under the Empty Category Principle, and thus should be disallowed.\n\nOther work focusses on some differences in grammatical adjunction possibilities to “that” versus “that-less” clauses in English, for which the CP Hypothesis apparently cannot account. It states that under the CP Hypothesis, both clauses are CPs and thus should display the same adjunction possibilities; this is not what we find in the data. Instead, disparities in grammaticality emerge in environments of topicalization and adverbial adjunction. The IP Hypothesis is said to make up for the shortcomings of the CP hypothesis in these domains. \n\nHowever, while both hypothesis possess some strong arguments, they also both have some crucial shortcomings. Further research is needed in order to concretely establish a more widely agreed-upon theory. \n\nOne of the main questions that arises in linguistics when examining grammatical concepts is how children learn them. For empty categories, this is a particularly interesting consideration, since, when children ask for a certain object, their guardians usually respond in “motherese”. An example of a motherese utterance which doesn't use empty categories is in response to a child’s request for a certain object. A parent might respond “You want what?” instead of “What do you want?”. In this sentence, the wh-word doesn't move, and so in the sentence that the child hears, there is no wh-trace. Possible explanations for the eventual acquisition of the notion of empty categories are that the child then learns that even when he or she doesn't hear a word in the original position, they assume one is still there, because they are used to hearing a word.\n\nAt the beginning of acquisition, children do not have a concrete concept of an empty category; it is simply a weaker version of the concept. It is noted that ‘thematic government’ may be all the child possesses at a young age and this is enough to recognize the concept of empty category. The proper amount of time must be given to learn the certain aspects of an empty category (case marking, monotonicity properties, etc.).\n\n"}

In engineering terms, the \"fit\" is the clearance between two mating parts, and the size of this clearance determines whether the parts can move independently from each other, or are then temporarily or even permanently joined. Engineering fits are generally described as a \"shaft and hole\" but are not limited to just round components. ISO is the internationally accepted standard for defining engineering fits, but ANSI is often still used in North America.\n\nISO and ANSI both group fits into three categories: clearance, location or transition, and interference. Within each category are several codes to define the size limits of the hole or shaft - the combination of which determines the type of fit. A fit is usually selected at the design stage according to whether the mating parts need to be accurately located, free to slide or rotate, separated easily, or resist separation. Cost is also a major factor in selecting a fit, as more accurate fits will be more expensive to produce, and tighter fits will be more expensive to assemble.\n\nThe International Organisation for Standardization system splits the three main categories into several individual fits based on the allowable limits for hole and shaft size. Each fit is allocated a code, made up of a number and a letter, which is used on engineering drawings in place of upper & lower size limits to reduce clutter in detailed areas.\n\nA fit is either specified as shaft-basis or hole-basis, depending on which part has its size controlled to determine the fit. To elaborate: in a hole-basis system, the size of the hole remains constant and it is the diameter of the shaft that is varied to determine the fit; conversely in a shaft-basis system, the size of shaft remains constant and the hole diameter is varied to determine the fit.\n\nThe ISO system uses an alpha-numeric code to illustrate the tolerance ranges for the fit, with the upper-case representing the hole tolerance and lower-case representing the shaft. For example, in H7/h6 (a commonly-used fit) H7 represents the tolerance range of the hole and h6 represents the tolerance range of the shaft. These codes can be used by machinists or engineers to quickly identify the upper and lower size limits for either the hole or shaft. The potential range of clearance or interference can be found by subtracting the smallest shaft diameter from the largest hole, and largest shaft from the smallest hole.\n\nThe three types of fit are:\n\nFor example, using an H8/f7 close-running fit on a 50mm diameter: \n\nFor example, using an H7/k6 similar fit on a 50mm diameter: \n\nFor example, using an H7/p6 press fit on a 50mm diameter: \n\n\"Interference Fits\n', also known as \"Press Fits\" or \"Friction Fits\", are fastenings between two parts in which the inner component is larger than the outer component. Achieving an interference fit requires applying force during assembly. After the parts are joined, the mating surfaces will feel pressure due to friction, and deformation of the completed assembly will be observed.\n\n\"Force fits\" are designed to maintain a controlled pressure between mating parts, and are used where forces or torques are being transmitted through the joining point. Like interference fits, force fits are achieved by applying a force during component assembly.\n\nFN 1 to FN 5\n\n\"Shrink fits\" serve the same purpose as force fits, but are achieved by heating one member to expand it while the other remains cool. The parts can then be easily put together with little applied force, but after cooling and contraction, the same dimensional interference exists as for a force fit. Like force fits, shrink fits range from FN 1 to FN 5.\n\nLocation fits are for parts that do not normally move relative to each other.\n\nLN 1 to LN 3 ( or LT 7 to LT 21? )\n\nLT 1 to LT 6\n\nLC 1 to LC 11\n\nThe smaller RC numbers have smaller clearances for tighter fits, the larger numbers have larger clearances for looser fits.\n\nFits of this kind are intended for the accurate location of parts which must assemble without noticeable play.\n\nFits of this kind are intended for the accurate location but with greater maximum clearance than class RC1. Parts made to this fit turn and move easily. This type is not designed for free run. Sliding fits in larger sizes may seize with small temperature changes due to little allowance for thermal expansion or contraction.\n\nFits of this kind are about the closest fits which can be expected to run freely. Precision fits are intended for precision work at low speed, low bearing pressures, and light journal pressures. RC3 is not suitable where noticeable temperature differences occur.\n\nFits of this kind are mostly for running fits on accurate machinery with moderate surface speed, bearing pressures, and journal pressures where accurate location and minimum play are desired. Fits of this kind also can be described as smaller clearances with higher requirements for precision fit.\n\nFits of this kind are designed for machines running at higher running speeds, considerable bearing pressures, and heavy journal pressure. Fits of this kind also can be described with greater clearances with common requirements for fit precision.\n\nFits of this kind are intended to use where accuracy is not essential. It is suitable for great temperature variations. This fit is suitable to use without any special requirements for precise guiding of shafts.\n\nThis kind of fit is intended for use where wide commercial tolerances may be required on the shaft. With this fits, the parts with great clearances with having great tolerances. Loose running fits exposed to effects of corrosion, contamination by dust and thermal or mechanical deformations.\n\n"}

Place names attest to Flemish having been spoken since the 8th century in the area that was ceded to France in the 17th century and which became known as French Flanders. Its dialect subgroup, called French Flemish, meanwhile, became a minority dialect that survives mainly in Dunkirk (\"Duinkerke\" in Dutch/\"Duunkerke\" in West Flemish = dune church), Bourbourg (\"Broekburg\" in Dutch), Calais (\"Kales\"), Saint-Omer (\"Sint-Omaars\") with an ethnic enclave Haut-Pont (\"Haute-Ponte\") known for its predominantly Flemish community and Bailleul (\"Belle\"). French-Flemish has about 20,000 daily users, and twice that number of occasional speakers. The language's status appears to be moribund, but there has been an active movement to retain French Flemish in the region.\n\nA growing, re-introduced language, French Flemish is taught in several schools in the French Westhoek. The ANVT-ILRF was given permission to carry out experimental lessons in four public schools (in Esquelbecq, Noordpeene, Volckerinckhove, Wormhout) for the school years of 2007–08 until 2010–11, after which it would be evaluated. Afterwards, all requirements were met but it was only allowed to continue them, but not to expand to other schools or to the \"collège\". On the other hand, the private Catholic education began teaching Dutch in collèges in Gravelines and Hondschoote.\n\nThough generally seen as a dialect of Dutch, some of its speakers prefer to call it a regional language. Jean-Paul Couché, chairman of the \"Akademie voor Nuuze Vlaemsche Taele\" (ANVT), argues:\nLinguistically, a dialect depends on a larger, national language. That does not apply to French Flemish. We are not connected to standard Dutch because it is an artificial language that was created based on the dialects of North Holland. Research shows that the distance between French Flemish and Dutch is greater than that between Dutch and German.\n\n\n"}

Journal clubs are usually organized around a defined subject in basic or applied research. For example, the application of evidence-based medicine to some area of medical practice can be facilitated by a journal club. Typically, each participant can voice their view relating to several questions such as the appropriateness of the research design, the statistics employed, the appropriateness of the controls that were used, etc. There might be an attempt to synthesize together the results of several papers, even if some of these results might first appear to contradict each other. Even if the results of the study are seen as valid, there might be a discussion of how useful the results are and if these results might lead to new research or to new applications.\n\nJournal clubs are sometimes used in the education of graduate or professional students. These help make the student(s) become more familiar with the advanced literature in their new field of study. In addition, these journal clubs help improve the students' skills of understanding and debating current topics of active interest in their field. This type of journal club may sometimes be taken for credit. Research laboratories may also organize journal clubs for all researchers in the lab to help them keep up with the literature produced by others who work in their field.\n\nTraditionally, journal clubs have met weekly or monthly to discuss current research in a topic relevant to the field. An analysis of one hundred publications describing and evaluating journal clubs found that they are most effective if they have a clearly identified leader and have an established purpose that all articles can be linked to.\n\nProminent journals and scientific societies have began hosting online commenting features that they are referring to as journal clubs.

{"id": "48793231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48793231", "title": "Kabardian grammar", "text": "Kabardian grammar\n\nKabardian is a Northwest Caucasian language with an ergative verb-final clause structure.\n\nKabardian is an ergative–absolutive language, which means that the subject of an intransitive verb behaves like the object of a transitive verb, and differently from the agent of a transitive verb. Nouns in Kabardian can have the following roles in a sentence:\n\nIn intransitive verbs the subject is in the absolutive case thus it indicates that the subject is changing.\n\n\n\nIn transitive verbs the subject is in the ergative case thus it indicates that the subject causes change to the object which gets the absolutive case.\n\n\n\nA Circassian noun can be in one of the following two states: singular plural\n\nSingular nouns have zero morpheme, while plural nouns use the additional хэ morpheme, which is attached to the main form of the word. For example: singular: унэ \"home\", тхылъ \"book\", plural: унэ-хэ-р \"homes\", тхылъ-хэ-р \"books\".\n\nUnlike English verbs, Circassian verbs use -х- or -я- morphemes to form their plural versions. The second morpheme is attached to the verb in front of the verb's root, and the first is attached after it. For example: ар макӏуэ \"he is going\", ахэр макӏуэ-х \"they are going\"; ар абы еджащ \"he read it\", ар ахэмэ я-джащ \"he read them\".\n\nCircassian nouns usually have either definite or indefinite form. The idea behind this conception is close to the idea of definite/indefinite articles in English. Definite form of Circassian nouns has -р or -м formats at the end of the word. For example: щӏалэ \"boy\" – indefinite noun (has none of the definite formats) - it can be used in generalizations or when the boy is unknown to either the \"speaker\" or \"listener\" (a/an or zero article in English); щӏалэр, щӏалэм \"the boy\" – it is used when the mentioned boy is well known to both the \"speaker\" and \"listener\".\n\nKabardian also declines nouns into four different cases, each with corresponding suffixes: absolutive, ergative, instrumental, and invertive.\nHas the suffix - р (e.g. щӏалэр 'the boy', щӏалэхэр ('the boys'), шыр 'the horse'). It acts as the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct object of transitive verbs.\n\n\nHas the suffix -м (e.g. щӏалэм 'the boy's', щӏалэхэмэ 'the boys<nowiki>'</nowiki>', шым 'the horse's). This case has two roles: Ergative role and Oblique role.\n\n\n\nThe Ergative-Oblique case can also be used as an adverbial modifier, for example: жэщ night → жэщым in the night.\n\nIndefinite nouns are marked by the affix -кӏэ : тхылъ-кӏэ, \"by/with book\", ӏэ-к1э \"by/with hand\". definite nouns express this case using the ergative affix -м in conjunction with the affix -кӏэ: уадэ-м-кӏэ \"by/with the hammer\", тхылъ-м-к1э \"by/with the book\".\n\nThe Instrumental case can also mark the direction of action:\n\nHas the suffix -уэ , or -у (e.g. щӏалу 'boy'). This case indicates the manner in which the verb was done.\n\nKabardian is a pro-drop language. The subject and the object pronouns are sometimes omitted when verb conjugations reflect number and person.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Kabardian, if a noun is accompanied by an adjective, the adjective is always placed right after the noun and also gets the grammatical role suffixes instead of the noun.\n\n\n\n\nIn Kabardian someone (person) or something (animal, plant, object) that does a specific verb (or something happened to him/it) can be represented with the verb word with the additional suffix -э (a) (for present tense -рэ (-ra)). For example:\n\nIn Kabardian someone (person) or something (animal, plant, object) that have a specific adjective can be presented with the adjective word with the additional noun case suffix (absolutive, ergative, etc.) For example:\n\nKabardian has three demonstratives: а /ʔaː/, мо /mo/ and мы /mə/.\n\nа /ʔaː/\n\nмо /maw/\n\nмы /mə/\n\nThe demonstratives can be used to express different things like:\n\nIn Kabardian, personal pronouns are only expressed in first person, second person in singular and plural forms.\n\nDemonstrative pronouns are мы \"this\", мо \"that\", а \"that\". There is a contradistinction between 'мы' and 'мо' on how far the referred object is. The pronoun 'а' is neutral on this matter. Third person pronouns are expressed as demonstrative pronouns.\n\nIn Kabardian whole one - зыгоруэ, Serves for indication of all notions corresponding to English words \"someone\", \"something\", \"someone\", \"something\", \"sometime\", \"somewhere\", etc. Зыгуэрэ changes either as noun – in number and in cases:\n\nIn Kabardian, like all Northwest Caucasian languages, the verb is the most inflected part of speech. Verbs are typically head final and are conjugated for tense, person, number, etc. Some of Circassian verbs can be morphologically simple, some of them consist only of one morpheme, like: кӏуэ \"go\", щтэ \"take\". However, generally, Circassian verbs are characterized as structurally and semantically difficult entities. Morphological structure of a Circassian verb includes affixes (prefixes, suffixes) which are specific to the language. Verbs' affixes express meaning of subject, direct or indirect object, adverbial, singular or plural form, negative form, mood, direction, mutuality, compatibility and reflexivity, which, as a result, creates a complex verb, that consists of many morphemes and semantically expresses a sentence. For example: уакъыдэсэгъэпсэлъэжы \"I am forcing you to talk to them again\" consists of the following morphemes: у-а-къы-дэ-со-гъэ-псэлъэ-жы, with the following meanings: \"you (у) with them (а) from there (къы) together (дэ) I (со) am forcing (гъэ) to speak (псэлъэн) again (жы)\".\n\nVerbs in Kabardian can be transitive or intransitive.\n\nIn a sentence with a transitive verb, nouns in the absolutive case (marked as -р) play the role of direct object. In the sentences of this type the noun in the subject's position is in the ergative case (marked as -м):\n\nIn these sentences the verbs етхы \"is writing\", къыщтащ \"took out\", къыубытащ \"has caught\" are transitive verbs, and the nouns письмэр \"letter\", уадэр \"hammer\", тхьак1умк1ыхьэр \"hare\" are in the absolutive case (suffix -р) and express direct object in the sentences, while the nouns щӏалэм \"boy\", пхъащӏэм \"carpenter\", хьэм \"dog\" are subjects expressed in the ergative case.\n\nIn a sentence with an intransitive verb, there is no direct object, and the real subject is usually expressed by a noun in the absolutive case.\n\nIn these sentences with intransitive verbs, nouns that play role of subject are expressed in the absolutive case: жэмахъуэ-р \"shepherd\", пэсакӏуэ-р \"guard\", лӏы-р \"man\".\n\nThere are verbs in the Kabardian language that in different contexts and situations can be used both as transitive and intransitive. For example:\n\nIn the first sentence the verb мэкъутэ \"is being broken\" is used as an intransitive verb that creates an absolutive construction. In the second sentence the verb йо-къутэ \"is breaking\" creates an ergative construction. Both of the verbs are formed from the verb къутэ-н \"to break\".\n\nIn the Kabardian language, intransitive verbs can have indirect objects in a sentence. The indirect objects are expressed by a noun in the oblique case (which is also marked as -м). For example:\n\nIn these sentences with intransitive verbs, nouns that play role of indirect object are expressed in the oblique case: пщащэ-м \"girl\", жыгы-м \"tree\", тхылъы-м \"book\".\n\nIntransitive verbs can be turned into transitive with the causative affix -гъэ- (meaning \"to force, to make\"). For example:\n\nThe verbs in the first sentences мажэ \"is running\", матхэ \"is writing\" are intransitive, and the verbs in the second sentences егъажэ \"forces ... to run\", егъатхэ \"makes ... to write\" are already transitive.\n\nKabardian verbs can be either dynamic or static.\n\nDynamic verbs express (process of) actions that are taking place (natural role of verbs in English):\n\nStatic verbs express states or results of actions:\n\nKabardian verbs have different forms to express different person. These forms are, mostly, created with specific prefixes. Here how it looks like in singular:\n\nand in plural:\n\nImperative mood of second person in singular has no additional affixes: щтэ \"take\", кӏуэ \"go\", тхы \"write\"; in plural the affix -фы is added in front of the verbs: фы-къак1у \"you (plural) go\", фы-тхы \"you (plural) write\", фы-щтэ \"you (plural) take\".\n\nConditional mood is expressed with suffix -мэ: сы-к1уэ-мэ \"if I go\", сы-жэ-мэ \"if I run\", с-щ1э-мэ \"if I do\".\n\nConcessive mood is expressed with suffix -ми: сы-к1уэ-ми \"even if I go\", сы-жэ-ми \"even if I run\", с-щ1э-ми \"even if I do\".\n\nAffirmative form is expressed with the affix -къэ: ма-кӏуэ-къэ \"isn't he is going?\", мэ-гыщӏэ-къэ \"isn't he washing?\".\n\nPresent participles in the Circassian language are formed from the appropriate dynamic verbs with the suffix -рэ:\n\nParticiples can also be created from static verbs. In this case no additional morphological modifications are required. For example: щысыр \"sitting\", щылъыр \"lying\". In the past and future tenses participles have no special morphological attributes, in other words, their form is identical to the main form of the verb. The forms of participles in different grammatical cases are equal to the forms of the appropriate verbs. The same is also true for their time-tenses.\n\nMasdar (a form of verb close to gerund) in the Kabardian language is expressed with the suffix -н:\n\nMasdar has grammatical cases:\n\nand different forms for different person:\n\nIn the Adyghe language negative form of a word is expressed with different morphemes (prefixes, suffixes). In participles, adverbial participles, masdars, imperative, interrogative and other forms of verbs their negative from is expressed with the prefix -мы, which, usually, goes before the root morpheme, that describes the main meaning:\n\nIn verbs the negative meaning can also be expressed with the suffix -къым, which usually goes after the suffixes of time-tenses. For example:\n\nIn Kabardian, the positional prefixes are expressing being in different positions and places and can also express the direction of the verb. Here is the positional conjugation of some dynamic verbs, showing how the prefix changes the indicated direction of the verb:\n\nHere is the positional conjugation of some verbs, showing how the root changes indicate position:\nExamples:\n\nщыт - [someone or something] stands (as a pose);\n\nIут - [someone or something] stands (behind);\n\nщIэт - [someone or something] stands (under)\n\nтет - [someone or something] stands (above)\n\nдэт - [someone or something] stands (between), etc.\n\nFrom the morphological point of view adjectives in the Circassian language are not very different from nouns. In combinations with nouns they lose their grammatical independence. Adjectives form their plural form the same way nouns do, they also use the same affixes to form different grammatical cases (from Absolutive to Adverbial).\n\nAdjectives can be either qualitative or relative.\n\nAdjectives can be in singular or plural form: хужы \"white\" (singular) - хужы-хэ-р \"whites\" (plural).\n\nThey switch grammatical cases similarly to nouns:\n\nA qualitative adjective as a compliment in a sentence goes after the word it describes: к1алэ дэгъу \"good boy\", унэ лъагэ \"high house\"; a relative adjective goes before it: пхъэ уадэ \"wooden hammer\", гъучӏ пӏэкӏор \"iron bed\". In the second case adjectives do not change their form, only the appropriate nous do. For example: in plural - пхъэ унэ \"wooden house\".\n\nIn different grammatical cases:\n\nCombining adjectives with nouns it is possible to produce a great lot of phrases: пщэщэ дахэ \"beautiful girl\", щӏалэ дэгъу \"good boy\", цӏыху кӏыхьэ \"long man\", гъуэгу занщӏэ \"straight road\", удз шхъуантӏэ \"green grass\" and so on. These phrases can be easily included into sentences. If a noun has a certain grammatical case, the adjective gets the suffix of the case instead of the noun, for example щӏэлэ лъэщы-р \"the strong boy (abs.) and уадэ псынщӏэ-мкӏэ \"using the light hammer (ins.).\n\nCircassian qualitative adjectives also have comparative and superlative forms. For example: нэхъ хужы \"whiter, more white\" (comparative form) and янэхъ хужы \"whitest, most white\",\n\nThe Comparative degree is formed by auxiliary word нэхъ:\n\nАр абы нэхъ лъагэ – he is higher than you, \nНэхъ ины хъущ – He became bigger [More big became],\nНэхъ лӏыгъэ къызхэбгъэлъын хуей - You must be braver.\n\nThe superlative degrees is formed by auxiliary word анахь (more than all...):\n\nАр пщащэмэ янэхъ дахэ – She is the most beautiful among the girls, \nАр псоми янэхъ лъагэ - It is the highest, \nПсэри шхын янэхъ дэгъумкӏэ игъэшхащ – (S)he feeds him with the tastiest meal, \nАр псоми янэхъ лъэщ – He is the strongest.\n\nThe following suffixes are added to nouns:\n\nThe following suffixes are added to adjectives:\n\nTo indicate a thought or an opinion of someone, the prefix фӏэ~ (fʼa~) is added to the adjective. This can also be used on nouns but it is very uncommon. For example:\n\nTo indicate a measure of a certain adjective the suffix ~гъэ (~ʁa) is added. Usually it is used for measurable adjectives like length, height, weight, size, strength and speed but it can be used on any adjective. This suffix turns the adjective to a noun.\n\n\nThe suffix ~гъакӏэ (~ʁaːt͡ʃʼa) is appended to adjectives to form nouns meaning \"the state of being the adjective\".\n\n\nIn the Kabardian language adverbs belong to these groups: adverbs of place, adverbs of time, adverbs of quality and adverbs of amount.\n\n\n\n\nAdverbs of this group are formed from the appropriate qualitative adjectives using the suffix ~у /~w/. Adverbs in this group describe the manner in which the verb was done.\n\n\nIn English the word \"and\" is used to connect parts of speech with others, while in Circassian, there are different ways to connect different parts of speech with others.\nThe conjunctions ыкӏи /ət͡ʃəj/ \"and\" can also be used to connect different parts of speech.\n\nConjunctions in the Circassian language play the same role like in English, they are used to connect together, in different ways, words or parts of a difficult sentence. According to structure of Circassian conjunctions they can be separated into two groups: simple and complex.\n\nAmong simple Circassian conjunctions are:\n\n\n\nIn the Circassian language participles are different both by their semantics and structure. Semantically they fall into the following groups: affirmative, negative, interrogative, intensive, indicatory and stimulating.\n\n\nIn the Circassian language, as well as in other Ibero-Caucasian languages, role of prepositions belongs to postpositions. It is difficult to define the exact count of postpositions in the Circassian language, because even such major parts of speech as nouns (from the point of view of their functionality) sometimes can be included into the group, together with some verb prefixes. For example, in the sentence Тхылъыр столым телъ \"The book is lying on the table\" the noun has no preposition, but the meaning remains clear because in the verb те-лъ \"is lying\" the prefix те- expresses something's being on a surface, so this form of the verb literally means \"on the surface is lying\".\n\nNouns and adverbs sometimes play role of postpositions. For example, nous that describe different parts of human body (head, nose, side and so on) sometimes function as postpositions. For example: Фызыр лӏым ипэ иту кӏуащ \"The wife went in front of the husband\" (the preposition \"in front of\" in the Circassian sentence is expressed by the phrase ипэ иту \"being in front of his nose\").\n\nNouns and pronouns combine with a postposition in the ergative grammatical case only. For example, the postposition деж \"near, beside\" requires a word in the ergative case:\n\n\nPostpositions can attach possessive prefixes to themselves. For example, in singular:\n\n\nin plural:\n\n\nThe following words are used as postpositions in the Circassian language:\n\n\n\n\n(-i-) and the multiplier digit root.\n\nfollowed by -и- (-i-) and the multiplier digit root.\n\nWhen composed, the hundred word takes the -рэ (-ra) suffix, as well as the ten and the unit if any (e.g.: щэрэ зырэ (ɕara zəra) [101], щэрэ тIурэ (ɕara tʷʼəra) [102], щэрэ пщӀыкӀузырэ (pʃʼəkʷʼətʷʼəra) [111], щитӀурэ щэщӀырэ плIырэ (ɕitʷʼəra ɕat͡ʃəra pɬʼəra) [234]).\n\n\nexample: ятIунэрэ - second (jaːtʷʼənara), ящынэрэ - third (jaːɕənara), яплIынэрэ - fourth (jaːpɬʼənara).\n\n"}

Some parapsychology and religious believers interpret alleged instances of levitation as the result of supernatural action of psychic power or spiritual energy. The scientific community states there is no evidence that levitation exists and alleged levitation events are explainable by natural causes (such as magic trickery, illusion, and hallucination).\n\nVarious religions have claimed examples of levitation amongst their followers. This is generally used either as a demonstration of the validity or power of the religion, or as evidence of the holiness or adherence to the religion of the particular levitator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevitation has been described in Jewish text many times by use of either magic or non-magical means. Levitation by magic was depicted in Jewish texts to be practiced by Balaam who lived at the time of Moses. Magic involves directly ordering the spirits to carry out tasks thereby ignoring God. Instead of submission to God, self pride and ego of the individual is used to order the spirits to carry out tasks such as levitation.\n\nLevitation by non-magical means was practiced by many Jewish sages throughout the ages. As such, the forehead is the most important part of the body and is responsible for the source of \"energy\" bringing about the levitation. The Baal Shem Tov (הבעל שם טוב) who lived during the early eighteenth century, Was told about: \"When he snapped his fingers, his chariot and horses floated tefah (8–10 centimeters) off the ground and moved at great speed, jumping on mountains and hills, until the Baal Shem Tov reached his destination\" Levitation was used for long range transport of individuals who mastered this form of transportation. However Levitation as such was not a means to an end. One can not learn levitation but rather a possibility that was made available due to a state of mind that was in complete love of God and keeping his commandments (Mitzvot) to the letter. Levitation is usually carried out by several means:\nMany Jewish rabbis and sages throughout the generations also used a form of קפיצת הדרך (Kefitzat Haderech) or \"leap\", which is a form of teleportation where each step taken was a distance of several miles (פרסה – literally: \"horseshoe\". Similar is ancient Iranian measure of distance, see parasang, about 4 miles).\nThe theory of levitation is explained by being in a state of mind where a person is abstract and spiritual in relation to the material or physical world on which he stands. When abstract or spiritual inspiration and thought grows to be sufficiently strong, the abstract observation becomes physical and concrete thereby enabling the person to stand on what others normally see as abstract and imaginary. To the levitator, the abstract is as real as the ground and earth is to others. The Rabbis have decreed that a height of three cubits from the ground is an abstract perimeter in which anything below that height is considered ground level. This decree has Halachic (legal) implications. Observing this decree to the letter enables levitation at a height of three cubits by materializing this abstract perimeter to be physical and concrete as is from the standpoint of the levitator.\n\nMany mediums have claimed to have levitated during séances, especially in the 19th century in Britain and America. Many have been shown to be frauds, using wires and stage magic tricks. Daniel Dunglas Home, a prolific and well-documented levitator of himself and other objects, was said by spiritualists to levitate outside of a window. Skeptics have disputed such claims. The researchers Joseph McCabe and Trevor H. Hall exposed the \"levitation\" of Home as nothing more than him moving across a connecting ledge between two iron balconies.\n\nThe magician Joseph Rinn gave a full account of fraudulent behavior observed in a séance of Eusapia Palladino and explained how her levitation trick had been performed. Milbourne Christopher summarized the exposure:\n\nThe levitation trick of the medium Jack Webber was exposed by the magician Julien Proskauer. According to Proskauer he would use a telescopic reaching rod attached to a trumpet to levitate objects in the séance room. The physicist Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe investigated the medium Kathleen Goligher at many sittings and concluded that no paranormal phenomena such as levitation had occurred with Goligher and stated he had found evidence of fraud. D'Albe had claimed the ectoplasm substance in the photographs of Goligher from her séances were made from muslin.\n\nA person photographed while bouncing may appear to be levitating. This optical illusion is used by religious groups and by spiritualist mediums, claiming that their meditation techniques allow them to levitate in the air. You can usually find telltale signs in the photography indicating that the subject was in the act of bouncing, like blurry body parts, a flailing scarf, hair being suspended in the air, etc.\n\n\nThe Boy Who Could Fly directed by Nick Castle (1986)\n\n\n\n"}

This two-person dance form has the man performing as the bullfighter and the woman as the cape. It is known as one of the fastest Latin ballroom dances because dancers make around 120 to 130 beats/steps per minute. In some versions, the man portrays the matador in the dance, and the woman portrays the bull. Flamenco-like qualities infuse the dance as the man and woman challenge each other.\n\nPasodoble is a lively style of dance to the duple meter march-like music. Its original form as a Spanish military march is still interpreted in the context of the Moors and Christians festivals, in southeastern Spain, and is the major focus of current Pasodoble productions.\n\nThe Pasodoble came from a French military march with the name \"Paso Redoble\". It has both Spanish and French characteristics. The steps often contain French terms, but the dance resembles the nature of the bullfight. It is believed to have emerged from southern French culture during the 1930s. The Pasodoble was a way for the French to portray the techniques used in Spanish bullfights. The name means Two-Steps and this is attributed to the marching nature of the dance.\n\nWith a binary rhythm and moderated movement, the Pasodoble was likely based on typical Spanish dances of the 16th century. During the 18th century, it was incorporated into comedies and adopted as a regulatory step for the Spanish infantry, with a special feature that makes the troops take the regular step: 120 steps per minute. The music was introduced to bullfights in the 19th century.\n\nFamous bullfighters have been honored with Pasodoble tunes named for them. Other tunes have been inspired by patriotic motifs or local characters. The Pasodoble is well-known and used today for dance competitions.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the pasodoble became part of the repertoire of Italian American musicians in San Francisco playing in the \"ballo liscio\" style. Four pasodobles were collected by Sidney Robertson Cowell for the WPA California Folk Music Project in 1939 by Mexican American wedding party band on mandolin, guitar, and violin.\n\n\nEl Piti, El Charro Cárdenas, El 11-81, San Antonio de Triana, Fermincito, Lorenzo Garza, El abuelito, El banderillero, María Caballé, El Berrendito de San Juan, Tarde de toros, Por tapatías, Toros en San Miguel, Rodolfo Gaona, Joselito Huerta, Toros de Llaguno, La Macarenita.\n\nBy Agustín Lara: Silverio Pérez, El Novillero, Fermín.\n\nThe Pasodoble is a fast-paced Latin American dance.\n\nPasodoble is based on music played at bullfights during the bullfighters' entrance (\"paseo\"), or during the passes (\"faena\") just before the kill. The leader of this dance plays the part of the matador. The follower generally plays the part of the matador's cape, but can also represent the shadow of the matador, as well as the flamenco dancer in some figures. The follower never represents the bull, although this is a common misconception.\n\nMany Pasodoble songs are variations of \"España Cañi\". The song has breaks or \"highlights\" in fixed positions in the song (two highlights at syllabus levels, three highlights and a longer song at Open levels). Highlights emphasize music and are more powerful than other parts of the music. Usually, dancers strike a dramatic pose and then hold position until the end of the highlight. Traditionally, Pasodoble routines are choreographed to match these highlights, as well as the musical phrases. Accordingly, most ballroom Pasodoble tunes are written with similar highlights (those without are simply avoided in competition).\n\nBecause of its heavily choreographed tradition, ballroom Pasodoble is danced mostly competitively, almost never socially, or without a previously learned routine. That said, in Spain, France, Vietnam, Colombia, Costa Rica and some parts of Germany, it is danced socially as a led (unchoreographed) dance. In Venezuela, Pasodoble is almost a must-have dance in weddings and big parties. It became especially famous thanks to the hit song \"Guitarra Española\" by Los Melódicos.\n\nThis dance gained popularity in the US in 1930. It was too difficult to achieve widespread popularity. All moves are sharp and quick. Pasodoble takes up a lot of space, limiting it to special occasions. \n\nIn competitive dance, modern Pasodoble is combined with other four dances (samba, cha-cha-cha, rumba and jive) under the banner International Latin. Modern Pasodoble dance consists of two dancing parts and one break in between for dancers of class D and of three parts and two breaks in between for dancers of class C, B, A, according to the IDSF classification. Dancers of lower than D-class usually perform only four official dances of the Latin-American Program.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25975", "title": "Reign of Terror", "text": "Reign of Terror\n\nThe Reign of Terror, or The Terror (), is the label given by most historians to a period during the French Revolution after the First French Republic was established.\n\nSeveral historians consider the \"reign of terror\" to have begun in 1793, placing the starting date at either 5 September, June or March (birth of the Revolutionary Tribunal), while some consider it to have begun in September 1792 (September Massacres), or even July 1789 (when the first lynchings took place), but there is a consensus that it ended with the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794.\n\nBetween June 1793 and the end of July 1794, there were 16,594 official death sentences in France, of which 2,639 were in Paris.\n\nThere was a sense of emergency among leading politicians in France in the summer of 1793 between the widespread civil war and counter-revolution. Bertrand Barère exclaimed on 5 September 1793 in the Convention: \"Let's make terror the order of the day!\" They were determined to avoid street violence such as the September Massacres of 1792 by taking violence into their own hands as an instrument of government.\n\nRobespierre in February 1794 in a speech explained the necessity of terror:\nSome historians argue that such terror was a necessary reaction to the circumstances. Others suggest there were additional causes, including ideological and emotional.\n\nEnlightenment thought emphasized the importance of rational thinking and began challenging legal and moral foundations of society, providing the leaders of the Terror with new ideas about the role and structure of government. Rousseau's Social Contract argued that each person was born with rights, and they would come together to form a government that would then protect those rights. Under the social contract, the government was required to act for the general will, which represented the interests of everyone rather than a few factions. Drawing from the idea of a general will, Robespierre felt that the French Revolution could result in a Republic built for the general will but only once those who fought this ideal were expelled. Those who resisted the government were deemed \"tyrants\" fighting against the virtue and honor of the general will. The leaders felt their ideal version of government was threatened from the inside and outside of France, and terror was the only way to preserve the dignity of the Republic created from French Revolution.\n\nRobespierre's ideology was not strictly derived from Rousseau. The writings of another Enlightenment thinker of the time, Baron de Montesquieu, greatly influenced Robespierre. One of Montesquieu’s writings, \"The Spirit of the Laws\", defines a core principle of a democratic government: virtue. He describes it as “the love of laws and of our country.” In Robespierre’s speech to theNational Convention on February 5, 1794, \"On Political Morality\", he talks about virtue being the “fundamental principle of popular or democratic government.\" This was, in fact, the same virtue defined by Montesquieu almost 50 years earlier. Robespierre believed that the virtue needed for any democratic government was extremely lacking in the French people. As a result, he decided to weed out those he believed could never possess this virtue. The result was a continual push towards Terror. The Convention used this as justification for the course of action to “crush the enemies of the revolution, ... let the laws be executed, … and let liberty be saved.”\n\nThese members of the Enlightenment movement greatly influenced revolutionary leaders; however, cautions from other Enlightenment thinkers were blatantly ignored. Voltaire’s warnings were often overlooked, though some of his ideas were used for justification of the Revolution and the start of the Terror. He protested against Catholic Dogmas and the ways of Christianity stating, “of all religions, the Christian should of course inspire the most toleration, but till now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.” These criticisms were often used by Robespierre and other leaders as justification for their anti-religious reforms. Voltaire also laid down some warnings. In his \"Philosophical Dictionary\", he states, “we are all steeped in weakness and error; let us forgive each other our follies; that is the first law of nature” and “every individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of his opinion, is a monster.\" The importance of forgiveness and understanding the failings of the human conditions were obviously lost on Robespierre and other leaders as they pursued Terror.\n\nAfter the beginning of the French Revolution, the surrounding monarchies did not show great hostility towards the rebellion. Though mostly ignored, Louis XVI was later able to find support in Leopold II of Austria (Marie Antionette’s brother) and Frederick William II of Prussia. On August 27, 1791, these foreign leaders made the Pillnitz Declaration saying they would restore the French monarch if other European rulers joined. In response to what they viewed to be the meddling of foreign powers, France declared war on April 20, 1792. However, at this point, the war was only Prussia and Austria against France. France began this war with a large series of defeats which set a precedent of fear of invasion in the people that would last throughout the war. Massive reforms of military institutions, while very effective in the long run, presented the initial problems of inexperienced forces and leaders of questionable political loyalty. In the time it took for officers of merit to use their new freedoms to climb the chain of command, France suffered. Many of the early battles were definitive losses for the French. There was the constant threat of the Austro-Prussian forces which were advancing easily toward the capital, threatening to destroy Paris if the monarch was harmed. This series of defeats, coupled with militant uprisings and protests within the borders of France pushed the government to resort to drastic measures to ensure the loyalty of every citizen to not only France but more importantly to the Revolution.\n\nWhile this series of losses was eventually broken, the reality of what might have happened if they persisted hung over France. The tide would not turn from them until September of 1792 when the French won a critical victory at Valmy preventing the Austro-Prussian invasion. While the French military had stabilized and was producing victories by the time the Reign of Terror officially began, the pressure to succeed in this international struggle acted as justification for the government to pursue its tyrannical actions. It was not until after the execution of Louis XVI and the annexation of the Rhineland that the other monarchies began to feel threatened enough to form the First Coalition. The Coalition, consisting of Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Holland, and Sardinia, began attacking France from all directions besieging and capturing ports and retaking ground lost to France. With so many similarities to the first days of the Revolutionary Wars, the French government with threats on all sides, unification of the country became a top priority. As the war continued and the Reign of Terror began, leaders saw a correlation between using terror and achieving victory. Well phrased by Albert Soboul, “terror, at first an improvised response to defeat, once organized became an instrument of victory.” The threat of defeat and foreign invasion may have helped spur the origins of the terror, but the timely success of the Terror with French victories added justification to its growth and continuation.\n\nDuring the Reign of Terror, the sans-culottes and the Hébertists put pressure on the National Convention delegates and contributed to the overall instability of France. The National Convention was bitterly split between the Montagnards and the Girondins. The Girondins were more conservative leaders of the National Convention, while the Montagnards supported radical violence and pressures of the lower classes. Once the Montagnards gained control of the National Convention, they began demanding radical measures. Moreover, the sans-culottes, the scrappy, urban workers of France, agitated leaders to inflict punishments on those who opposed the interests of the poor. The sans-culottes’ violent demonstrations pushing their demands, created constant pressure for the Montagnards to enact reform. The sans-culottes fed the frenzy of instability and chaos by utilizing popular pressure during the Revolution. For example, the sans-culottes sent letters and petitions to the Committee of Public Safety urging them to protect their interests and rights with measures such as taxation of foodstuffs that favored workers over the rich. They advocated for arrests of those deemed to oppose reforms against those with privilege, and the more militant members would advocate pillage in order to achieve the desired equality. The resulting instability caused problems that made forming the new Republic and achieving full political support even more critical.\n\nThe Reign of Terror was characterized by a dramatic rejection of long-held religious authority, its hierarchical structure, and the corrupt and intolerant influence of the aristocracy and clergy. Religious elements that long stood as symbols of stability for the French people, were replaced by reason and scientific thought. The radical revolutionaries and their supporters desired a cultural revolution that would rid the French state of all Christian influence. This process began with the fall of the monarchy, an event that effectively defrocked the State of its sanctification by the clergy via the doctrine of Divine Right and ushered in an era of reason.\n\nMany long-held rights and powers were stripped from the Church and given to the State. In 1789, church lands were expropriated and priests killed and forced to leave France. A Festival of Reason was held in the Notre Dame Cathedral, which was renamed \"The Temple of Reason\", and the old traditional calendar was replaced with a new revolutionary one. The leaders of the Terror tried to address the call for these radical, revolutionary aspirations, while at the same time trying to maintain tight control on the de-Christianization movement that was threatening to the clear majority of the still devoted Catholic population of France. The tension sparked by these conflicting objectives laid a foundation for the \"justified\" use of terror to achieve revolutionary ideals and rid France of the religiosity that revolutionaries believed was standing in the way.\n\nOn 10 March 1793 the National Convention created the Revolutionary Tribunal. Among those charged by the tribunal, about a half were acquitted (though the number dropped to about a quarter after the enactment of the Law of 22 Prairial). In March rebellion broke out in the Vendée in response to mass conscription, which developed into a civil war that lasted until after the Terror.\n\nOn 6 April the Committee of Public Safety was created, which gradually became the de facto war-time government.\n\nOn 2 June, the Parisian sans-culottes surrounded the National Convention, calling for administrative and political purges, a low fixed price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral franchise to sans-culottes alone. With the backing of the national guard, they persuaded the convention to arrest 29 Girondist leaders. In reaction to the imprisonment of the Girondin deputies, some thirteen departments started the Federalist revolts against the National Convention in Paris, which were ultimately crushed. \n\nOn 24 June, the convention adopted the first republican constitution of France, the French Constitution of 1793. It was ratified by public referendum, but never put into force.\n\nOn 13 July the assassination of Jean-Paul Marat – a Jacobin leader and journalist – resulted in a further increase in Jacobin political influence. Georges Danton, the leader of the August 1792 uprising against the king, was removed from the committee. On July 27, 1793, Robespierre became part of the Committee of Public Safety. \n\nOn 23 August, the National Convention decreed the levée en masse, \"The young men shall fight; the married man shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn all lint into linen; the old men shall betake themselves to the public square in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic.\"\nOn 9 September, the convention established paramilitary forces, the \"revolutionary armies\", to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government. On 17 September, the Law of Suspects was passed, which authorized the imprisonment of vaguely defined \"suspects\". This created a mass overflow in the prison systems. On 29 September, the convention extended price fixing from grain and bread to other essential goods, and also fixed wages.\n\nOn 10 October, the Convention decreed that \"the provisional government shall be revolutionary until peace.\" On 24 October, the French Republican Calendar was enacted. The trial of the Girondins started on the same day and they were executed on 31 October.\n\nAnti-clerical sentiments increased during 1793 and a campaign of dechristianization occurred. On 10 November (20 Brumaire Year II of the French Republican Calendar), the Hébertists organized a Festival of Reason.\nOn 14 Frimaire (5 December 1793) was passed the Law of Frimaire, which gave the central government more control over the actions of the representatives on mission.\n\nOn 16 Pluviôse (4 February 1794), the National Convention decreed that slavery be abolished in all of France and French colonies.\n\nOn 8 and 13 Ventôse (26 February and 3 March), Saint-Just proposed decrees to confiscate the property of exiles and opponents of the revolution, known as the Ventôse Decrees.\n\nBy the end of 1793, two major factions had emerged, both threatening the Revolutionary Government: the Hébertists, who called for an intensification of the Terror and threatened insurrection, and the Dantonists, led by Georges Danton, who demanded moderation and clemency. The Committee of Public Safety took actions against both. The major Hébertists were tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed on 24 March. The Dantonists were arrested on 30 March, tried on 3 to 5 April and executed on 5 April.\n\nOn 20 Prairial (8 June) was celebrated across the country the Festival of the Supreme Being, which was part of the Cult of the Supreme Being, a deist national religion. On 22 Prairial (10 June), the National Convention passed a law proposed by Georges Couthon, known as the Law of 22 Prairial, which simplified the judicial process and greatly accelerated the work of the Revolutionary Tribunal. With the enactment of the law, the number of executions greatly increased, and the period from this time to the Thermidorian Reaction became known as \"The Grand Terror\".\n\nOn 8 Messidor (26 June), the French army won the Battle of Fleurus, which marked a turning point in France's military campaign and undermined the necessity of wartime measures and the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government.\n\nThe fall of Robespierre was brought about by a combination of those who wanted more power for the Committee of Public Safety (and a more radical policy than he was willing to allow) and the moderates who completely opposed the revolutionary government. They had, between them, made the Law of 22 Prairial one of the charges against him, so that, after his fall, to advocate terror would be seen as adopting the policy of a convicted enemy of the republic, putting the advocate's own head at risk. Between his arrest and his execution, Robespierre may have tried to commit suicide by shooting himself, although the bullet wound he sustained, whatever its origin, only shattered his jaw. Alternatively, he may have been shot by the gendarme Merda. The great confusion that arose during the storming of the municipal Hall of Paris, where Robespierre and his friends had found refuge, makes it impossible to be sure of the wound's origin.\nIn any case, Robespierre was guillotined the next day.\n\nThe reign of the standing Committee of Public Safety was ended. New members were appointed the day after Robespierre's execution, and limits on terms of office were fixed (a quarter of the committee retired every three months). The Committee's powers were gradually eroded.\n\n\n\"Battle of Valmy, (20 September 1792).\" Weapons and Warfare. April 09, 2018.

{"id": "34071233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34071233", "title": "Shakespeare's handwriting", "text": "Shakespeare's handwriting\n\nWilliam Shakespeare's handwriting is known from six surviving signatures, all of which appear on legal documents — and from three pages of the handwritten manuscript of the play \"Sir Thomas More\".\n\nShakespeare wrote in the style known as the Secretary hand. It was native and common in England at the time, and was the cursive style taught in schools. It is not the italic script, which was encroaching as an alternate form (and which is more familiar to readers of today). Shakespeare's handwriting shows a freedom to make variances in style depending on the mood or the composition being written. The three-page addition to \"Sir Thomas More\" is written in a fluid manner, by a skillful and experienced writer. The writing begins with indications of speed, in the manner of a scrivener, with a practiced sense of uniformity. Then the writing style changes over to a more deliberate and heavier style, as can be seen, for example, in the speeches of Thomas More, which require greater thought and choice of words. Throughout, the writing shows a disposition to play with the pen, to exaggerate certain curves, to use heavier downstrokes, and to finish some final letters with a small flourish. These characteristics are more evident in the slower, deliberate sections.\n\nThe secretary hand was popular with authors. It was used by Christopher Marlowe and Francis Bacon. It could be written with ease and swiftness, it was conducive to the use of abbreviations, and it had a beauty in its curves as it swept across the page. As it was taught in the schools and by tutors, it allowed for great diversity — each writer could choose a style for each letter. To the untrained eye, the secretary hand can at first appear to be indecipherable.\n\nShakespeare wrote with a quill in his right hand. A quill would need to be prepared and sharpened. Black ink would be derived from “oak apples” (small lumps in oak trees caused by insects), with vinegar and gum arabic added.\n\nJohn Heminges and Henry Condell, who edited the First Folio in 1623, wrote that Shakespeare's \"mind and hand went together, and what he thought he uttered with that easiness that we have scare received from him a blot in his papers.\" In his posthumously published essay, \"Timber: Or, Discoveries\", Ben Jonson wrote:I remember the players have often mentioned it as an honor to Shakespeare, that in his writing, whatsoever he penned, he never blotted out a line. My answer hath been, ‘Would he hath blotted a thousand,’ which they thought a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this but for their ignorance, who chose that circumstance to commend their friend by wherein he most faulted; and to justify mine own candor, for I loved the man, and do honor his memory on this side idolatry as much as any. He was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free nature; had an excellent fancy, brave notions, and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometime it was necessary he should be stopped.\n\nSerious study of Shakespeare's handwriting began in the 18th century with scholars Edmond Malone and George Steevens. By the late nineteenth century paleographers began to make detailed study of the evidence in the hope of identifying Shakespeare's handwriting in other surviving documents. In those cases when the actual handwriting is not extant, the study of the published texts has yielded indirect evidence of his handwriting quirks through reading and apparent misreadings by compositors. To give one example of this, in the early published versions of Shakespeare's plays there occurs a recurrence of an upper case letter “C” when the lower case is called for. This might indicate that Shakespeare was fond of such a usage in his handwriting, and that the compositors (working from the handwriting) followed the usage. When trying to determine who the author is of either a printed work or a pen-and-ink manuscript, this is one possible method of discovering such indications.\n\nThere are six surviving signatures, attached to four legal documents, that are generally recognised as authentic:\n\n\nThe signatures appear as follows:\n\n\nThe first signature includes a short horizontal stroke above the letter “m” and a horizontal stroke or flourish in the stem of the letter “p”, which may be read as “per” or, less likely, as an indication of abbreviation. The fifth signature also contains a horizontal stroke above the letter “m”. All of his signatures are written in his native English script, which he would have learned as a young boy in school. He used the long Italian cursive letter “s” in the center of his surname, a concession to the new style, except for the fifth signature, in which he reverts to the native English long “s”.\nThree of these signatures are abbreviated versions of the surname, using breviographic conventions of the time, which was common practice. For example, Edmund Spenser sometimes wrote his name out in full (spelling his first name Edmund or Edmond), but often used the abbreviated forms \"Ed: spser\" or \"Edm: spser\". The signatures on the Blackfriar's document may have been abbreviated because they had to be squeezed into the small space provided by the seal-tag, which they were legally authenticating. \nThe three signatures on the will were first reproduced by the 18th-century scholar George Steevens, who copied them as accurately as he could by hand and then had his drawings engraved. The facsimiles were first printed in the 1778 edition of Shakespeare's plays, edited by Steevens and Samuel Johnson. The publication of the signatures led to a controversy about the proper spelling of Shakespeare's name. The paleographer Edward Maunde Thompson later criticised the Steevens transcriptions, arguing that his original drawings were inaccurate.\n\nThe two signatures relating to the house sale were identified in 1768 and acquired by David Garrick, who presented them to Steevens' colleague Edmond Malone. By the later nineteenth century the signatures had been photographed. Photographs of these five signatures were published by Sidney Lee.\n\nThe final signature, on the \"Bellott v Mountjoy\" deposition, was discovered by 1909 by Charles William Wallace. It was first published by him in the March 1910 issue of \"Harper's Magazine\" and reprinted in the October 1910 issue of \"Nebraska University Studies\".\n\nAlthough some scholars took note of, and reproduced, Shakespeare's handwriting as early as the 18th century, the paleographer Sir Edward Maunde Thompson wrote in 1916 that the subject of Shakespeare's handwriting had “never been subjected to a thorough and systematic study.” One reason for this neglect is that the only examples of Shakespeare's handwriting that were known to earlier scholars were five authentic signatures. A further difficulty was that three of the known signatures were written in the last weeks of Shakespeare's life, when he may have been suffering from a tremor or otherwise enfeebled by illness, and the other two had been written under conditions that restrained free movement of the hand. Those signed to the Blackfrairs mortgage had to be squeezed into the narrow space of the seal.\n\nUnder the circumstances, with evidence limited to those five signatures, an attempt to reconstitute the handwriting that Shakespeare actually used might have been considered impossible. But then in 1910, the discovery of the sixth signature on the \"Bellott v Mountjoy\" deposition changed all this. This signature was written with a free hand, and it was the key to an important part of the problem. Thompson identified distinctive characteristics in Shakespeare's hand, which include delicate introductory upstrokes of the pen, the use of the Italian long “s” in the middle of his surname in his signatures, an unusual form of the letter “k”, and a number of other personal variations.\n\nThe first time it was suggested that the three-page addition to the play \"Sir Thomas More\" was composed and also written out by William Shakespeare was in a correspondence to the publication \"Notes and Queries\" in July 1871 by Richard Simpson, who was not an expert in handwriting. Simpson's note was titled: \"Are there any extant MSS in Shakespeare’s handwriting?\" His idea received little serious attention for a few decades. After more than a year James Spedding wrote to the same publication in support of that particular suggestion by Simpson, saying that the handwriting found in \"Sir Thomas More\" \"agrees with [Shakespeare’s] signature, which is a simple one, and written in the ordinary character of the time.\"\n\nAfter a detailed study of the \"More\" script, which included analysing every letter formation, and then comparing it to the signatures, Thompson concluded that \"sufficient close resemblances have been detected to bring the two handwritings together and to identify them as coming from one and the same hand,\" and that \"in this addition to the play of \"Sir Thomas More\" we have indeed the handwriting of William Shakespeare.\"\n\nThompson believed that the first two pages of the script were written quickly, using writing techniques that indicate Shakespeare had received \"a more thorough training as a scribe than had been thought probable\". These pages contain abbreviations and contractions of words which were \"in common use among lawyers and trained secretaries of the day.\" These pages show more of the characteristics of \"the scrivener\", but the third page, having been written with slower deliberation, reveals more of Shakespeare's own quirks, or, as he put it, \"more of the hand of the author\". In addition there are in the three pages suggestions of a \"tendency to formality and ornamental calligraphy.\"\n\nThe problems editors or compositors can face when transforming the handwritten manuscript into the printed page are demonstrated in the printed edition of \"Sir Thomas More\", edited in 1990 by Gabrieli and Melchiori. In the following line spoken by More addressing the mob: “This is the strangers’ case, and this your mountanish inhumanity,” the reading of the word “mountanish” is supported by references in \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Cymbeline\". However, in the handwritten manuscript by Hand D, the “un” in the word has only three strokes, or minims, which makes it look like an “m”: as “momtanish”. So the word has been read by modern editors as “moritanish” (referring to the inhabitants of Mauritania), or as \"momtanish\" (a contraction of “Mohamadanish” - referring to the followers of Mohammad), or as “mountainish” (suggesting huge and uncivil), as well as other readings and spellings.\n\nIn the late 1930s a possible seventh Shakespeare signature was found in the Folger Library copy of William Lambarde's \"Archaionomia\" (1568), a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws. In 1942, Giles Dawson published a report cautiously concluding that the signature was genuine, and 30 years later he concluded that there was \"an overwhelming probability that the writer of all seven signatures was the same person, William Shakespeare.\" Nicholas Knight published a book-length study a year later with the same conclusion. Samuel Schoenbaum considered that the signature was more likely to be genuine than not with \"a better claim to authenticity than any other pretended Shakespeare autograph,\" while also writing that \"it is premature ... to classify it as the poet's seventh signature.\" Stanley Wells notes that the authenticity of both the Montaigne and Lambarde signatures have had strong support.\n\nIn 2012 Gregory Heyworth, as head of the \"Lazarus Project\", which has a mission to use advance technology to create images of culturally important artifacts, along with his students at the University of Mississippi, used a 50-megapixel multispectral digital imaging system to enhance the signature and get a better idea of what it looked like.\n\nThe first person to claim that the body of Shakespeare's last will and testament was written in Shakespeare's own handwriting was John Cordy Jeaffreson, who compared the letters in the will and in the signature, and then expressed his findings in a letter to \"Athenaeum\" (1882). He suggests that the will was intended to be a rough draft, and that the progressively deteriorating script indicates an enfeebling illness, an illness which may have caused the “rough draft” to become the will itself.\n\nJohn Pym Yeatman is another who considered that the body of the will is in Shakespeare's handwriting. In his book, \"Is William Shakespeare’s Will Holographic?\" (1901), he argues against the often repeated idea that Francis Collins (or \"Francis Collyns\" as it is often spelled), Shakespeare's lawyer, wrote the will. Among the evidence that Yeatman offers, is Collins' signature on the will itself. Collins’ name occurs three times in the will: twice in the body, and the third time when Collyns signs his name at the bottom of page three. The body of the will, along with Shakespeare's own signature, are written in handwriting known as the secretary hand, whereas the signature by Collins, particularly the initial letters, is written in a modern hand. The difference between the two handwriting styles is primarily in the formations used for each letter of the alphabet. Yeatman then states that the last insertion regarding the second-best bed, is in a handwriting that \"exactly corresponds with the signature below it.\" This he adds, is \"of the utmost value, in proof that one hand wrote them both.\"\nIn 1985 manuscript expert Charles Hamilton, compared the signatures, the handwritten additions to the play \"Sir Thomas More\", and the body of the last will and testament. In his book \"In Search of Shakespeare\" he placed letters from each document side-by-side to demonstrate the similarities and his reasons for considering that they were written by the same hand.\n\nThe handwriting in the body of Shakespeare's last will and testament indicates that it is written all by one person in at least two sessions: First the entire will of three pages, then a revision on the lower half of the first page that runs over onto page 2, and finally the additions or bequests that are inserted between the lines. The lower half of page one, the part that was written later than page 2 and 3, shows a disintegration of the penmanship. This problem worsens until the last written line, leaving his second-best bed to his wife, is almost indecipherable. The ink used for the interlinear additions is different from the ink in the main body of the will, but it is the same ink that is used by the four witnesses that signed the will.\n\nThe Shakespearean scholar, Eric Sams points to a letter written by the 20-year-old Earl of Southampton to a Mr. Hicks (or Hyckes) regarding Lord Burghley, at a time when Southampton had not yet agreed to marry Burghley's granddaughter. The letter is signed by the Earl of Southampton, but the body of the letter was written by someone else. It is dated 26 June 1592, a year when it is thought that Shakespeare may have first encountered Southampton and had begun writing the sonnets. Sams notices that the handwriting in the body of the letter is literally a secretary hand, and it resembles the handwriting found in the addition to \"Sir Thomas More\" by Hand D. After close scrutiny of the letters and pen strokes in each, and referencing the detailed descriptions found in Edward Thompson's \"Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study\", Sams finds that there are enough similarities to merit further consideration. This letter was written by Southampton regarding one of his houses that was in need of repair, and as Eric Sams points out, it was written at a time when Southampton was the recipient of sonnets written by Shakespeare that contained imagery suggesting the young lord might consider repairing his house: “Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate/Which to repair should be thy chief desire.” (Sonnet 10, lines 7-8) And “who lets so fair a house fall to decay?” (Sonnet 13, line 9)\n\nOn 4 December 1612 Shakespeare's friends, Elizabeth and Adrian Quiney, sold a house to a man named William Mountford for 131 pounds. The deed of sale, written out apparently by a legal clerk, was witnessed and signed twice in different parts of the deed by William Shakespeare's daughter, Judith, who used for her signature a squiggle with two loops in it. Judith's given name and surname were written out on either side of Judith's marks, by someone who was not the clerk, or the witnesses or the signers. Paleographer Charles Hamilton studied this document and found that Judith's surname as it is written out is so similar to the surname in Shakespeare's own signature as it appears on other documents, that it may be reasonable to consider that Shakespeare could have been there at the signing of the deed, and assisted his daughter as she made her mark. Hamilton considers that there may be reasons for Shakespeare not witnessing the document himself. For example, he could have been involved in some way that would have precluded him from acting as witness, either in the drawing up of the deed or in advising the Quineys.\n\nOn 20 October 1596 a rough draft was drawn up for an application to the College of Heralds for Shakespeare's father to be granted a coat-of-arms. This draft has numerous emendations and corrections, and it appears to have been written by someone \"inexperienced in drawing up heraldic drafts.\" The script is written at a great speed, but with the fluid, easy character of one well practiced with a quill. The velocity of the writing is increased by shortcuts and abbreviations. Formalities of punctuation and consistent spelling are left behind, as words are pared down. Loops and tails are sheared, and letters are flattened for speed. The handwriting slows down only to produce a clearly legible italic script for proper nouns and family names. Later that day, the same person drew up a second rough draft based on the first one, incorporating the edits that were indicated in the previous draft. This application was ultimately successful, and the coat-of-arms was granted.\n\nA third application was drafted three years later in 1599. This time it was applying to have impaled onto Shakespeare's coat-of-arms, the arms of the Ardens of Wilmcote, Shakespeare's mother's family. All three drafts include a pen-and-ink sketch of the proposed coat-of-arms: a shield, with a spear, surmounted by a falcon standing on its left leg, grasping a spear with its right talon. The coat-of-arms is seen to be pictorially expressing Shakespeare's name with the verb \"shake\" shown by the falcon with its fluttering wings grasping a \"spear\".\n\nWilliam Dethick is mentioned in all the application drafts, as the “Garter-Principal king of Arms in England”. It has been suggested that Dethick wrote the drafts, but Dethick's handwriting, a combination of secretary and italic scripts, appears to be quite different. The idea that Shakespeare himself made out the applications, and that it is his handwriting on the rough drafts, was raised by Samuel A. Tannenbaum. Paleantologist Charles Hamilton considering this, published illustrations for comparison by placing words and letters from the applications side-by-side with words and letters from the additions by Hand D in the play, \"Sir Thomas More\", and other sources.\n\nThough the playwright's handwriting for \"Edward III\" has not survived, the text, as printed, has been analyzed in order to discover indications of characteristics that the handwriting might contain, in the same way that the \"First Folio\" and other printed texts have been scrutinized.\n\nThis has led to findings that may support the attribution of this play to Shakespeare. For example, scholar Eric Sams, assuming that the pages by Hand D in the play, \"Sir Thomas More\" are indeed Shakespeare's, points out that Hand D shows what scholar Alfred W. Pollard refers to as “excessive carelessness” in minim errors — that is, writing the wrong number of downstrokes in the letters i, m, n, and u. This particular characteristic is indicated in numerous misreadings by the original compositor who set the printed type for \"Edward III\". This is also found in the Good Quartos, which are thought to be printed from Shakespeare's handwritten manuscripts. For a second example, Hand D uses a short horizontal stroke above a letter to indicate contraction, but twice omits it. This characteristic is indicated by the compositor's misreadings in a number of instances found in \"Edward III\". And in another example, Hand D and the Good Quartos often show “the frequent and whimsical appearance of an initial capital C, in a way which shows that Shakespeare’s pen was fond of using this letter in place of the minuscule.\" This characteristic occurs throughout both the \"Sonnets\" and \"Edward III\".\n\nIn London in the 1790s the author, Samuel Ireland, announced a great discovery of Shakespearean manuscripts, including four plays. This turned out to be a hoax created with great effort by his son, William Henry Ireland. It fooled many experts, caused great excitement, and a production of one of the plays was announced. Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone was one who was not taken in. The forged handwriting and signatures bore little or no resemblance to Shakespeare's. Malone said it was a clumsy fraud filled with errors and contradictions, and detailed his reasons. William Henry Ireland eventually confessed.\n\nOn a loose fly-leaf of a copy of John Florio’s translation of the works of Montaigne, is a signature that reads \"Willm. Shakspere”. The signature is now widely recognized as a poor forgery, but it has taken in scholars in the past. The book's first known owner was the Reverend Edward Patteson, who lived in the 1780s in Staffordshire, a few miles from Stratford-upon-Avon. The book was auctioned for a large amount (100 pounds) in 1838 to a London bookseller named Pickering, who then sold it to the British Museum. Frederic Madden accepted it as authentic in his pamphlet \"Observations on an Autograph of Shakspere and the Orthography of his name\" (1838), and so did Samuel A. Tannenbaum in his essay “Reclaiming One of Shakspere’s Signatures” (1925). Others, including John Louis Haney writing in 1906, were not taken in. A close consideration and analysis of the signature and each letter shows it to differ markedly from any of the authentic signatures.\n\n"}

Scything leaves a windrow of cut stems to the left of the reaper and, if cut skillfully, leaves the seed heads more or less aligned. These are then picked up and tied into sheaves by following workers using other cut stems as ties. These workers, or a following team, then stand the sheaves up in stooks to dry.\n\nA sheaf stook is self-supporting, well-ventilated for drying, and comprises about eight sheaves built upright in an A shape with their seed-heads meeting at the top: this keeps the heads off the ground, allows the grain to dry and discourages vermin.\nThe drying sheaves are later either placed by hand or pitched onto a cart. The traditional sheaf pitchfork has a long wooden handle, two short tynes and a rounded back to make the placing of sheaves easy. The gathered sheaves are then either built into stacks (thatched stacks could be over 20' high) or taken to a barn for further drying before being threshed to separate the grain from the stems.\n\nThe mechanisation of agriculture in industrialised countries, in particular the introduction of the combine harvester from the middle of the 19th century, has made the sheaf redundant but sheaves remain in widespread use wherever harvesting is still done by hand or by reaper-binder.\n\nIn heraldry a wheat sheaf is called a garb.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28394", "title": "Stuttering", "text": "Stuttering\n\nStuttering, also known as stammering, is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases as well as involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The term \"stuttering\" is most commonly associated with involuntary sound repetition, but it also encompasses the abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech, referred to by people who stutter as \"blocks\", and the prolongation of certain sounds, usually vowels or semivowels. According to Watkins et al., stuttering is a disorder of \"selection, initiation, and execution of motor sequences necessary for fluent speech production\". For many people who stutter, repetition is the primary problem. The term \"stuttering\" covers a wide range of severity, encompassing barely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe symptoms that effectively prevent oral communication. In the world, approximately four times as many men as women stutter, encompassing 70 million people worldwide, or about 1% of the world's population.\n\nThe impact of stuttering on a person's functioning and emotional state can be severe. This may include fears of having to enunciate specific vowels or consonants, fears of being caught stuttering in social situations, self-imposed isolation, anxiety, stress, shame, low self-esteem, being a possible target of bullying (especially in children), having to use word substitution and rearrange words in a sentence to hide stuttering, or a feeling of \"loss of control\" during speech. Stuttering is sometimes popularly seen as a symptom of anxiety, but there is actually no direct correlation in that direction (though as mentioned the inverse can be true, as social anxiety may actually develop in individuals as a result of their stuttering).\n\nStuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Acute nervousness and stress do not cause stuttering, but they can trigger stuttering in people who have the speech disorder, and living with a stigmatized disability can result in anxiety and high allostatic stress load (chronic nervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, exacerbating the problem in the manner of a positive feedback system; the name 'stuttered speech syndrome' has been proposed for this condition. Neither acute nor chronic stress, however, itself creates any predisposition to stuttering.\n\nThe disorder is also \"variable\", which means that in certain situations, such as talking on the telephone or in a large group, the stuttering might be more severe or less, depending on whether or not the stutterer is self-conscious about their stuttering. Stutterers often find that their stuttering fluctuates and that they have \"good\" days, \"bad\" days and \"stutter-free\" days. The times in which their stuttering fluctuates can be random. Although the exact etiology, or cause, of stuttering is unknown, both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech therapy techniques available that may help decrease speech disfluency in some people who stutter to the point where an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present. The severity of the person's stuttering would correspond to the amount of speech therapy needed to decrease disfluency. For severe stuttering, long-term therapy and hard work is required to decrease disfluency.\n\nPrimary stuttering behaviors are the overt, observable signs of speech disfluencies, including repeating sounds, syllables, words or phrases, silent blocks and prolongation of sounds. These differ from the normal dysfluencies found in all speakers in that stuttering dysfluencies may last longer, occur more frequently, and are produced with more effort and strain. Stuttering dysfluencies also vary in quality: common dysfluencies tend to be repeated movements, fixed postures, or superfluous behaviors. Each of these three categories is composed of subgroups of stutters and dysfluencies.\n\nThe severity of a stutter is often not constant even for people who severely stutter. People who stutter commonly report dramatically decreased disfluency when talking in unison with another speaker, copying another's speech, whispering, singing, and acting or when talking to pets, young children, or themselves. Other situations, such as public speaking and speaking on the telephone, are often greatly feared by people who stutter, and increased stuttering is reported.\n\nStuttering could have a significant negative cognitive and affective impact on the person who stutters. It has been described in terms of the analogy to an iceberg, with the immediately visible and audible symptoms of stuttering above the waterline and a broader set of symptoms such as negative emotions hidden below the surface. Feelings of embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt are frequent in people who stutter, and may actually increase tension and effort, leading to increased stuttering. With time, continued exposure to difficult speaking experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image. Many perceive stutterers as less intelligent due to their disfluency; however, as a group, individuals who stutter tend to be of above average intelligence. A person who stutters may project his or her attitudes onto others, believing that they think he or she is nervous or stupid. Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program.\n\nMany people who stutter report a high emotional cost, including jobs or promotions not received, as well as relationships broken or not pursued.\n\nLinguistic tasks can invoke speech disfluency. People who stutter may experience varying disfluency. Tasks that trigger disfluency usually require a controlled-language processing, which involves linguistic planning. In stuttering, it is seen that many individuals do not demonstrate disfluencies when it comes to tasks that allow for automatic processing without substantial planning. For example, singing \"Happy Birthday\" or other relatively common, repeated linguistic discourses, could be fluid in people who stutter. Tasks like this reduce semantic, syntactic, and prosodic planning, whereas spontaneous, \"controlled\" speech or reading aloud requires thoughts to transform into linguistic material and thereafter syntax and prosody. Some researchers hypothesize that controlled-language activated circuitry consistently does not function properly in people who stutter, whereas people who do not stutter only sometimes display disfluent speech and abnormal circuitry.\n\nNo single, exclusive cause of developmental stuttering is known. A variety of hypotheses and theories suggests multiple factors contributing to stuttering. Among these is the strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis. Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are three times as likely to develop a stutter. However, twin and adoption studies suggest that genetic factors interact with environmental factors for stuttering to occur, and many people who stutter have no family history of the disorder.\nThere is evidence that stuttering is more common in children who also have concurrent speech, language, learning or motor difficulties. Robert West, a pioneer of genetic studies in stuttering, has suggested that the presence of stuttering is connected to the fact that articulated speech is the last major acquisition in human evolution.\n\nAnother view is that a stutter (stammer) is a complex tic. This view is held for the following reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds he has a new baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.\n\nIn a 2010 article, three genes were found by Dennis Drayna and team to correlate with stuttering: GNPTAB, GNPTG, and NAGPA. Researchers estimated that alterations in these three genes were present in 9% of people who stutter who have a family history of stuttering.\n\nFor some people who stutter, congenital factors may play a role. These may include physical trauma at or around birth, learning disabilities, as well as cerebral palsy. In other people who stutter, there could be added impact due to stressful situations such as the birth of a sibling, moving, or a sudden growth in linguistic ability.\n\nThere is clear empirical evidence for structural and functional differences in the brains of people who stutter. Research is complicated somewhat by the possibility that such differences could be the consequences of stuttering rather than a cause, but recent research on older children confirms structural differences thereby giving strength to the argument that at least some of the differences are not a consequence of stuttering.\n\nAuditory processing deficits have also been proposed as a cause of stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, and stuttering may be reduced when auditory feedback is altered, such as by masking, delayed auditory feedback (DAF), or frequency altered feedback. There is some evidence that the functional organization of the auditory cortex may be different in people who stutter.\n\nThere is evidence of differences in linguistic processing between people who stutter and people who do not stutter. Brain scans of adult people who stutter have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.\n\nThe \"capacities and demands\" model has been proposed to account for the heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the \"capacity\" that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the \"demands\" placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and cognitive or affective issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or self esteem or inadequate language skills or external factors such as peer pressure, time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures. However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.\n\nThough neuroimaging studies have not yet found specific neural correlates, there is much evidence that the brains of adults who stutter differ from the brains of adults who do not stutter. Several neuroimaging studies have emerged to identify areas associated with stuttering. In general, during stuttering, cerebral activities change dramatically in comparison to silent rest or fluent speech between people who stutter and people who do not stutter. There is evidence that people who stutter activate motor programs before the articulatory or linguistic processing is initiated. Brain imaging studies have primarily been focused on adults. However, the neurological abnormalities found in adults does not determine whether childhood stuttering caused these abnormalities or whether the abnormalities cause stuttering.\n\nStudies utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) have found during tasks that invoke disfluent speech, people who stutter show hypoactivity in cortical areas associated with language processing, such as Broca's area, but hyperactivity in areas associated with motor function. One such study that evaluated the stutter period found that there was over activation in the cerebrum and cerebellum, and relative deactivation of the left hemisphere auditory areas and frontal temporal regions.\n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has found abnormal activation in the right frontal operculum (RFO), which is an area associated with time-estimation tasks, occasionally incorporated in complex speech.\n\nResearchers have explored temporal cortical activations by utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG). In single-word-recognition tasks, people who do not stutter showed cortical activation first in occipital areas, then in left inferior-frontal regions such as Broca’s area, and finally, in motor and premotor cortices. The people who stutter also first had cortical activation in the occipital areas but the left inferior-frontal regions were activated only after the motor and premotor cortices were activated.\n\nDuring speech production, people who stutter show overactivity in the anterior insula, cerebellum and bilateral midbrain. They show underactivity in the ventral premotor, Rolandic opercular and sensorimotor cortex bilaterally and Heschl’s gyrus in the left hemisphere. Additionally, speech production in people who stutter yields underactivity in cortical motor and premotor areas.\n\nMuch evidence from neuroimaging techniques has supported the theory that the right hemisphere of people who stutter interferes with left-hemisphere speech production.\n\nAdults who stutter have anatomical differences in gyri within the perisylvian frontotemporal areas. A large amount of white matter is found in the right hemisphere of the brain, including the region of the superior temporal gyrus. This was discovered using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). On the other hand, lesser amounts of white matter are found in the left inferior arcuate fasciculus connecting the temporal and frontal areas in stuttering adults.\n\nResults have shown that there is less coordination between the speech motor and planning regions in the brain's left hemisphere of men and women who stutter, when compared to a non-stuttering control group. Anatomical connectivity of the speech motor and planning regions is less vigorous in adults who stutter, especially women. Men who stutter seem to have more right-sided motor connectivity. On the other hand, stuttering women have less connectivity with the right motor regions.\n\nIn non-stuttering, normal speech, PET scans show that both hemispheres are active but that the left hemisphere may be more active. By contrast, people who stutter yield more activity on the right hemisphere, suggesting that it might be interfering with left-hemisphere speech production. Another comparison of scans anterior forebrain regions are disproportionately active in stuttering subjects, while post-rolandic regions are relatively inactive.\n\nBilateral increases and unusual right-left asymmetry has been found in the planum temporale when comparing people who stutter and people who do not stutter. These studies have also found that there are anatomical differences in the Rolandic operculum and arcuate fasciculus.\n\nThe corpus callosum transfers information between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The corpus callosum, rostrum, and the anterior mid-body sections are larger in adults who stutter as compared to normally fluent adults. This difference may be due to unusual functions of brain organization in stuttering adults and may be a result of how the stuttering adults performed language-relevant tasks. Furthermore, previous research has found that adults who stutter show cerebral hemispheres that contain uncommon brain proportions and allocations of gray and white matter tissue.\n\nRecent studies have found that adults who stutter have elevated levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, and have thus found dopamine antagonists that reduce stuttering (see anti-stuttering medication below). Overactivity of the midbrain has been found at the level of the substantia nigra extended to the red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus, which all contribute to the production of dopamine. However, increased dopamine does not imply increased excitatory function since dopamine's effect can be both excitatory or inhibitory depending upon which dopamine receptors (labelled D1 – D5) have been stimulated.\n\nSome characteristics of stuttered speech are not as easy for listeners to detect. As a result, diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP). Diagnosis of stuttering employs information both from direct observation of the individual and information about the individual’s background, through a case history. Information from both sources should span multiple, various settings and times. The SLP may collect a case history on the individual through a detailed interview or conversation with the parents (if client is a child). They may also observe parent-child interactions and observe the speech patterns of the child's parents. The overall goal of assessment for the SLP will be (1) to determine whether a speech disfluency exists, and (2) assess if its severity warrants concern for further treatment.\n\nDuring direct observation of the client, the SLP will observe various aspects of the individual’s speech behaviors. In particular, the therapist might test for factors including the types of disfluencies present (using a test such as the Dysfluency Type Index (DTI)), their frequency and duration (number of iterations, percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS)), and speaking rate (syllables per minute (SPM), words per minute (WPM)). They may also test for naturalness and fluency in speaking (naturalness rating scale (NAT), test of childhood stuttering (TOCS)) and physical concomitants during speech (\"Riley’s Stuttering Severity Instrument Fourth Edition (SSI-4)\"). They might also employ a test to evaluate the severity of the stuttering and predictions for its course. One such test includes the stuttering prediction instrument for young children (SPI), which analyzes the child’s case history, part-word repetitions and prolongations, and stuttering frequency in order to determine the severity of the disfluency and its prognosis for chronicity for the future.\n\nStuttering is a multifaceted, complex disorder that can impact an individual’s life in a variety of ways. Children and adults are monitored and evaluated for evidence of possible social, psychological or emotional signs of stress related to their disorder. Some common assessments of this type measure factors including: anxiety (Endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS)), attitudes (personal report of communication apprehension (PRCA)), perceptions of self (stutterers’ self-rating of reactions to speech situations (SSRSS)), quality of life (overall assessment of the speaker’s experience of stuttering (OASES)), behaviors (older adult self-report (OASR)), and mental health (composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)).\n\nThe SLP will then attempt to combine the information garnered from the client's case study along with the information acquired from the assessments in order to make a final decision regarding the existence of a fluency disorder and determine the best course of treatment for the client.\n\nStuttering can also diagnosed per the DSM-5 diagnostic codes by clinical psychologists with adequate expertise. The most recent version of the DSM-5 describes this speech disorder as \"Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)\" for developmental stuttering, and \"Adult-onset Fluency Disorder\". However, the specific rationale for this change from the DSM-IV is ill-documented in the APA's published literature, and is felt by some to promote confusion between the very different terms \"fluency\" and \"disfluency\".\n\nDevelopmental stuttering is stuttering that originates when a child is learning to speak and develops as the child matures into adulthood.\n\nOther disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering include autism, cluttering, Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, palilalia, spasmodic dysphonia, selective mutism, and social anxiety.\n\nStuttering is typically a developmental disorder beginning in early childhood and continuing into adulthood in at least 20% of affected children. The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months. Although there is variability, early stuttering behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions, while secondary behaviours such as tension, avoidance or escape behaviours are absent. Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech. With young stutterers, disfluency may be episodic, and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relatively decreased disfluency.\n\nThough the rate of early recovery is very high, with time a young person who stutters may transition from easy, relaxed repetition to more tense and effortful stuttering, including blocks and prolongations. Some propose that parental reactions may affect the development of a chronic stutter. Recommendations to \"slow down\", \"take a breath\", \"say it again\", etc., may increase the child’s anxiety and fear, leading to more difficulties with speaking and, in the \"cycle of stuttering,\" to yet more fear, anxiety and expectation of stuttering. With time secondary stuttering, including escape behaviours such as eye blinking and lip movements, may be used, as well as fear and avoidance of sounds, words, people, or speaking situations. Eventually, many become fully aware of their disorder and begin to identify themselves as stutterers. With this may come deeper frustration, embarrassment and shame. Other, rarer patterns of stuttering development have been described, including sudden onset with the child being unable to speak, despite attempts to do so. The child usually is unable to utter the first sound of a sentence, and shows high levels of awareness and frustration. Another variety also begins suddenly with frequent word and phrase repetition, and does not include the development of secondary stuttering behaviours.\n\nStuttering can also have its roots in development. Many toddlers and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter as adults, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as pseudo-stuttering or as a normal disfluency. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Children with a normal disfluency usually have brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, the stuttering usually comes and goes and is most noticeable when a child is excited, stressed or overly tired. Stuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.\n\nIn rare cases, stuttering may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke, or drug use. The stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback (see below), which may promote decreasing disfluency in people who stutter with the developmental condition, are not effective with the acquired type.\n\nPsychogenic stuttering may also arise after a traumatic experience such as a grief, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event, it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations, and there is little awareness or concern shown by the speaker.\n\nBefore beginning treatment, an assessment is needed, as diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP).\nWhile there is no complete cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often elicited as a result of stuttering, and consequently exacerbates stuttering symptoms. This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life. Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.\n\nSpeech language pathologists teach people who stutter to control and monitor the rate at which they speak. In addition, people may learn to start saying words in a slightly slower and less physically tense manner. They may also learn to control or monitor their breathing. When learning to control speech rate, people often begin by practising smooth, fluent speech at rates that are much slower than typical speech, using short phrases and sentences. Over time, people learn to produce smooth speech at faster rates, in longer sentences, and in more challenging situations until speech sounds both fluent and natural. When treating stuttering in children, some researchers recommend that an evaluation be conducted every three months in order to determine whether or not the selected treatment option is working effectively. \"Follow-up\" or \"maintenance\" sessions are often necessary after completion of formal intervention to prevent relapse.\n\nFluency shaping therapy, also known as \"speak more fluently\", \"prolonged speech\", or \"connected speech\", trains people who stutter to speak less disfluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue). It is based on operant conditioning techniques.\n\nPeople who stutter are trained to reduce their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants, and using other disfluency-reducing techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts. The result is very slow, monotonic, but fluent speech, used only in the speech clinic. After the person who stutters masters these skills, the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually. This more normal-sounding, fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic, though lack of speech naturalness at the end of treatment remains a frequent criticism. Fluency shaping approaches are often taught in intensive group therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete, but more recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to be effective.\n\nThe goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful. The rationale is that since fear and anxiety causes increased stuttering, using easier stuttering and with less fear and avoidance, stuttering will decrease. The most widely known approach was published by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy. However, depending on the patient, speech therapy may be ineffective.\n\nAltered auditory feedback, so that people who stutter hear their voice differently, has been used for over 50 years in the treatment of stuttering. Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by blocking out the person who stutters' voice while talking (masking), by delaying slightly the voice of the person who stutters (delayed auditory feedback) or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback). Studies of these techniques have had mixed results, with some people who stutter showing substantial reductions in stuttering, while others improved only slightly or not at all. In a 2006 review of the efficacy of stuttering treatments, none of the studies on altered auditory feedback met the criteria for experimental quality, such as the presence of control groups.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any drug for the direct treatment of stuttering. However, the effectiveness of pharmacological agents, such as benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotic and antihypertensive medications, and dopamine antagonists in the treatment of stuttering has been evaluated in studies involving both adults and children.\nA comprehensive review of pharmacological treatments of stuttering in 2006 concluded that few of the drug trials were methodologically sound. Of those that were, only one, not unflawed study, showed a reduction in the frequency of stuttering to less than 5% of words spoken. In addition, potentially serious side effects of pharmacological treatments were noted, such as weight gain, sexual dysfunctions and the potential for blood pressure increases. There is one new drug studied especially for stuttering named pagoclone, which was found to be well-tolerated \"with only minor side-effects of headache and fatigue reported in a minority of those treated\".\n\nWith existing behavioral, prosthetic, and pharmaceutical treatments providing limited relief from the overt symptoms of stuttering, support groups and the self-help movement continue to gain popularity and support by professionals and people who stutter. Self-help groups provide people who stutter a shared forum within which they can access resources and support from others facing the same challenges of stuttering. One of the basic tenets behind the self-help movement is that since a cure does not exist, quality of life can be improved by not thinking about the stammer for prolonged periods. Psychoanalysis has claimed success in the treatment of stuttering. Hypnotherapy has also been explored as a management alternative. Support groups further focus on the fact that stuttering is not a physical impediment but a psychological one.\n\nCognitive behavior therapy has been used to treat stuttering. Also sociological approaches has been explored regarding how social groups maintain stuttering through social norms.\n\nSeveral treatment initiatives, for example the McGuire programme, and the Starfish Project advocate diaphragmatic breathing (or \"costal breathing\") as a means by which stuttering can be controlled.\n\nAmong preschoolers, the prognosis for recovery is good. Based on research, about 65% of preschoolers who stutter recover spontaneously in the first two years of stuttering, and about 74% recover by their early teens. In particular, girls seem to recover well. For others, early intervention is effective in helping the child overcome disfluency.\n\nOnce stuttering has become established, and the child has developed secondary behaviors, the prognosis is more guarded, and only 18% of children who stutter after five years recover spontaneously. However, with treatment young children may be left with little evidence of stuttering.\n\nWith adult people who stutter, there is no known cure, though they may make partial recovery or even complete recovery with intervention. People who stutter often learn to stutter less severely, though others may make no progress with therapy.\n\nEmotional sequelae associated with stuttering primarily relates to state-dependent anxiety related to the speech disorder itself. However, this is typically isolated to social contexts that require speaking, is not a trait anxiety, and this anxiety does not persist if stuttering remits spontaneously. Research attempting to correlate stuttering with generalized or state anxiety, personality profiles, trauma history, or decreased IQ have failed to find adequate empirical support for any of these claims.\n\nThe lifetime prevalence, or the proportion of individuals expected to stutter at one time in their lives, is about 5%, and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females. However, there is not much information known about the underlying cause for such a skewed sex ratio. Most stuttering begins in early childhood, and studies suggest that 2.5% of children under the age of 5 stutter. As seen in children who have just begun stuttering, there is an equivalent number of boys and girls who stutter. Still, the sex ratio appears to widen as children grow: among preschoolers, boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter by about a two to one ratio, or less. This ratio widens to three to one during first grade, and five to one during fifth grade, as girls have higher recovery rates. Due to high (approximately 65–75%) rates of early recovery, the overall prevalence of stuttering is generally considered to be approximately 1%.\n\nCross-cultural studies of stuttering prevalence were very active in early and mid-20th century, particularly under the influence of the works of Wendell Johnson, who claimed that the onset of stuttering was connected to the cultural expectations and the pressure put on young children by anxious parents. Johnson claimed there were cultures where stuttering, and even the word \"stutterer\", were absent (for example, among some tribes of American Indians). Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts, so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined. It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race, although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs. Some believe stuttering occurs in all cultures and races at similar rates, about 1% of general population (and is about 5% among young children) all around the world. A US-based study indicated that there were no racial or ethnic differences in the incidence of stuttering in preschool children. At the same time, there are cross-cultural studies indicating that the difference between cultures may exist. For example, summarizing prevalence studies, E. Cooper and C. Cooper conclude: \"On the basis of the data currently available, it appears the prevalence of fluency disorders varies among the cultures of the world, with some indications that the prevalence of fluency disorders labeled as stuttering is higher among black populations than white or Asian populations\" (Cooper & Cooper, 1993:197). In his \"Stuttering and its Treatment: Eleven lectures\" Mark Onslow remarked that \"one recent study with many participants (N=119,367) convincingly reported more stuttering among African Americans than other Americans. Why this could be the case is challenging to explain...\"\n\nDifferent regions of the world are researched very unevenly. The largest number of studies has been conducted in European countries and in North America, where the experts agree on the mean estimate to be about 1% of the general population (Bloodtein, 1995. A Handbook on Stuttering). African populations, particularly from West Africa, might have the highest stuttering prevalence in the world—reaching in some populations 5%, 6% and even over 9%. Many regions of the world are not researched sufficiently, and for some major regions there are no prevalence studies at all (for example, in China). Some claim the reason for this might be a lower incidence in the general population in China.\n\nBecause of the unusual-sounding speech that is produced and the behaviors and attitudes that accompany a stutter, it has long been a subject of scientific interest and speculation as well as discrimination and ridicule. People who stutter can be traced back centuries to the likes of Demosthenes, who tried to control his disfluency by speaking with pebbles in his mouth. The Talmud interprets Bible passages to indicate Moses was also a person who stuttered, and that placing a burning coal in his mouth had caused him to be \"slow and hesitant of speech\" (Exodus 4, v.10).\n\nGalen's humoral theories were influential in Europe in the Middle Ages for centuries afterward. In this theory, stuttering was attributed to imbalances of the four bodily humors—yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. Hieronymus Mercurialis, writing in the sixteenth century, proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet, reduced libido (in men only), and purging. Believing that fear aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this. Humoral manipulation continued to be a dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century. Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the Roman emperor Claudius was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.\n\nIn and around eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe, surgical interventions for stuttering were recommended, including cutting the tongue with scissors, removing a triangular wedge from the posterior tongue, and cutting nerves, or neck and lip muscles. Others recommended shortening the uvula or removing the tonsils. All were abandoned due to the high danger of bleeding to death and their failure to stop stuttering. Less drastically, Jean Marc Gaspard Itard placed a small forked golden plate under the tongue in order to support \"weak\" muscles.\nItalian pathologist Giovanni Morgagni attributed stuttering to deviations in the hyoid bone, a conclusion he came to via autopsy. Blessed Notker of St. Gall (c. 840–912), called Balbulus (\"The Stutterer\") and described by his biographer as being \"delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine,\" was invoked against stammering.\n\nA famous Englishman who stammered was King George VI. George VI went through years of speech therapy, most successfully under Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue, for his stammer. This is dealt with in the Academy Award-winning film \"The King's Speech\" (2010) in which Colin Firth plays George VI. The film is based on an original screenplay by David Seidler who also used to stutter as a child until age 16.\n\nAnother notable case was that of English Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Churchill claimed, perhaps not directly discussing himself, that \"[s]ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience...\" However, those who knew Churchill and commented on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him. His secretary Phyllis Moir commented that \"Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter\" in her 1941 book \"I was Winston Churchill's Private Secretary\". She also noted about one incident \"It’s s s simply s s splendid\" he stuttered, as he always did when excited.\" Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of \"The American Mercury\" (1942) that \"Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple\" and that \"born with a stutter and a lisp, both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking. It is characteristic of the man’s perseverance that, despite his staggering handicap, he made himself one of the greatest orators of our time.\"\n\nFor centuries \"cures\" such as consistently drinking water from a snail shell for the rest of one's life, \"hitting a stutterer in the face when the weather is cloudy\", strengthening the tongue as a muscle, and various herbal remedies were used. Similarly, in the past people have subscribed to theories about the causes of stuttering which today are considered odd. Proposed causes of stuttering have included tickling an infant too much, eating improperly during breastfeeding, allowing an infant to look in the mirror, cutting a child's hair before the child spoke his or her first words, having too small a tongue, or the \"work of the devil\".\n\nSome people who stutter, who are part of the disability rights movement, have begun to embrace their stuttering voices as an important part of their identity. In July 2015 the UK Ministry of Defence announced the launch of the Defence Stammering Network to support and champion the interests of British military personnel and MOD civil servants who stammer and to raise awareness of the condition.\n\nBilingualism is often referred to those who are capable of communication in more than one language since birth and throughout childhood. Considering that language and culture are relatively fluid factors in one's understanding and production of language, it makes sense that bilingualism can be an important feature that impacts speech fluency. There are several ways during which stuttering may be noticed in bilingual children including the following.\nIt should also be noted that stuttering may present differently depending on the languages the individual uses. For example, morphological and other linguistic differences between languages may make presentation of disfluency appear to be more or less of a problem depending on the individual case.\n\nMuch research is being conducted to look at the prevalence of stuttering in bilingual populations and the differences between languages. For instance, one study concluded that bilingual children who spoke English and another language had an increased risk of stuttering and a lower chance of recovery from stuttering than monolingual speakers and speakers who spoke solely a language other than English. Another study, though methodologically weak, showed relatively indistinguishable percentages of monolingual and bilingual stutterers. Due to so much conflicting data, the relationship between bilingualism and stuttering has been called enigmatic, which can demonstrate the intricacies of the topic and encourages more research to be conducted in order to sway the belief of impact the relationship between bilingualism and stuttering has.\n\nJazz and Eurodance musician Scatman John wrote the song \"Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop)\" to help children who stutter overcome adversity. Born John Paul Larkin, Scatman spoke with a stutter himself and won the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's Annie Glenn Award for outstanding service to the stuttering community.\n\nFiction character Arkwright from the British sitcom \"Open All Hours\" stammered and much of the series' humour revolved around this. Recurring character Reginald Barclay from the \"Star Trek\" television franchise and the Emperor Claudius from the \"I, Claudius\" series by Robert Graves and acted by Derek Jacobi are portrayed as suffering from and overcoming their stuttering.\n\nLooney Tunes character Porky Pig has a notable stutter, which features in one of the character's most well-known catchphrases (\"Th-th-th-that's all, folks!\"). The character's stuttering originated from the authentic stutter of the voice artist, Joe Dougherty. Dougherty's stutter caused recording sessions to take longer than otherwise necessary, causing Warner Bros. to replace Dougherty with Mel Blanc, who provided Porky's voice for the rest of his life.\n\nThe cartoon \"T.U.F.F. Puppy\" presents the character Keswick as stuttering.\nIn the 1996 film \"Primal Fear\", Edward Norton plays Aaron, a shy altar boy with a stutter who is accused of murdering an influential bishop.\n\nThe 2015 Indian (Malayalam) film \"Su.. Su... Sudhi Vathmeekam\" starring Jayasurya had portrayed the life of a real life person who overcomes the challenges faced in life due to stammering.\n\nThe 2016 Russian film \"Sheep & Wolves\" presents a wolf name Skinny with a stutter.\n\n\n\n\n(Organizations)\n"}

{"id": "118475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118475", "title": "Vinoba Bhave", "text": "Vinoba Bhave\n\nVinayak Narahari \"Vinoba\" Bhave (; 11 September 1895 – 15 November 1982) was an Indian advocate of nonviolence and human rights. Often called \"Acharya\" (Sanskrit for teacher), he is best known for the Bhoodan Movement. He is considered as a \"National Teacher of India\" and the spiritual successor of Mohandas Gandhi.\n\nVinayaka Narahari Bhave was born on 11 September 1895 in a small village called Gagoji (present day Gagode Budruk) in Kolaba in the Konkan region of what is now Maharashtra. Vinayaka was the eldest son of Narahari Shambhu Rao and Rukmini Devi. The couple had five children; four sons named Vinayaka (affectionately called Vinya), Balakrishna, Shivaji and Dattatreya, and one daughter. His father was a trained weaver with a rationalist modern outlook, and worked in Baroda. Vinayaka was brought up by his grandfather, Shamburao Bhave and was greatly influenced by his mother Rukmini Devi, a religious woman from Karnataka. Vinayaka was highly inspired after reading the Bhagavad Gita, at a very young age.\nA report in the newspapers about Gandhi's speech at the newly founded Benaras Hindu University attracted Bhave's attention. In 1916, on his way to Mumbai (then Bombay) to appear for the intermediate examination, Bhave threw his school and college certificates into a fire. Bhave took the decision after reading the piece of writing in the newspaper written by Mahatma Gandhi. \nHe wrote a letter to Gandhi and after an exchange of letters, Gandhi advised Bhave to come for a personal meeting at Kochrab Ashram in Ahmedabad. Bhave met Gandhi on 7 June 1916 and subsequently abandoned his studies. Bhave participated with keen interest in the activities at Gandhi's ashram, like teaching, studying, spinning and improving the life of the community. His involvement with Gandhi's constructive programmes related to Khadi, village industries, new education (Nai Talim), sanitation and hygiene also kept on increasing.\n\nBhave went to Wardha on 8 April 1921 to take charge of the Ashram as desired by Gandhi. In 1923, he brought out \"Maharashtra Dharma\", a Marathi monthly which had his essays on the Upanishads. Later on, this monthly became a weekly and continued for three years. In 1925, he was sent by Gandhi to Vaikom, Kerala to supervise the entry of the Harijans to the temple.\n\nBhave was arrested several times during the 1920s and 1930s and served a five-year jail sentence in the 1940s for leading non-violent resistance to British rule. The jails for Bhave had become the places of reading and writing. He wrote Ishavasyavritti and Sthitaprajna Darshan in jail. He also learnt four South Indian languages and created the script of Lok Nagari at Vellore jail. In the jails, he gave a series of talks on Bhagavad Gita in Marathi, to his fellow prisoners. Bhave participated in the nationwide civil disobedience periodically conducted against the British, and was imprisoned with other nationalists. Despite these many activities, he was not well known to the public. He gained national prominence when Gandhi chose him as the first participant in a new nonviolent campaign in 1940.\nAll were calling him in his short name, Vinoba.\nBhave's younger brother Balkrishna was also a Gandhian. Gandhi entrusted him and Manibhai Desai to set up a nature therapy ashram at Urali Kanchan where Balkrishna spent all his life,\n\nHe was associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the Indian independence movement. He stayed for some time at Gandhi's Sabarmati ashram in a cottage that was named after him, 'Vinoba Kutir'. There he gave a series of talks on the Gita, in his native language Marathi, to his fellow prisoners.\n\nThese highly inspiring talks were later published as the book \"Talks on the Gita\", and it has been translated into many languages both in India and elsewhere. Bhave felt that the source of these talks was something from above and he believed that its influence will endure even if his other works were forgotten.\n\nIn 1940 he was chosen by Gandhi to be the first individual Satyagrahi (an individual standing up for Truth instead of a collective action) against the British rule. It is said that Gandhi envied and respected Bhave's celibacy, a vow he made in his adolescence, in fitting with his belief in the Brahmacharya principle. Bhave also participated in the Quit India Movement.\n\nBhave's religious outlook was very broad and it synthesised the truths of many religions. This can be seen in one of his hymns \"Om Tat Sat\" which contains symbols of many religions. His slogan \"जय जगत्\" (Jay Jagat) i.e. \"victory to the world\" finds reflection in his views about the world as a whole.\n\nBhave observed the life of the average Indian living in a village and tried to find solutions for the problems he faced with a firm spiritual foundation. This formed the core of his \"Sarvodaya movement\". Another example of this is the Bhoodan (land gift) movement started at Pochampally on 18 April 1951, after interacting with 80 Harijan families. He walked all across India asking people with land to consider him as one of their sons and so give him one sixth of their land which he then distributed to landless poor. Non-violence and compassion being a hallmark of his philosophy, he also campaigned against the slaughtering of cows.\n\nBhave said, \"I have walked all over India for 13 years. In the backdrop of enduring perpetuity of my life's work, I have established 6 ashrams.\n\nThe Brahma Vidya Mandir is one of the ashrams that Bhave created. It is a small community for women that was created in order for them to become self-sufficient and non-violent in a community. This group farms to get their own food, but uses Gandhi's beliefs about food production, which include sustainability and social justice, as a guide. This community, like Gandhi and Bhave, has been influenced greatly by the \"Bhagavad-Gita\" and that is also used to determine their practices. The community perform prayers as a group every day, reciting from the Isha Upanishad at dawn, the Vishnu Sahasranama at mid-morning, and the \"Bhagavad-Gita\" in the evening. As of today, there are around 25 women who are members of the community and several men have also been allowed to join in the community.\n\nSince its founding in 1959, members of Brahma Vidya Mandir (BVM), an intentional community for women in Paunar, Maharashtra, have dealt with the struggle of translating Gandian values such as self-sufficiency, non-violence, and public-service into specific practices of food production and consumption. BVM's existence and the counter-narrative its residents practice demonstrate how one community debate the practicalities and tradeoffs in their application of self-sufficiency, non-violence, and radical democracy to their own social and geographic context. One narrative described by BVM and the farmers that work with them is that large-scale agriculture is inevitable, necessary, and the sole possibility of feeding the world. They reject the narrative that success in agriculture comes from expensive technology. BVM is a small community in India, therefore it does not hold much power in its beliefs and practices. However, India today proudly proclaims its large and growing middle class, and although many see Gandhi as a hero, some reject his views in favor of US-style-consumerism and look for an alternate route in agriculture with technological advancements. The existence of BVM provides a counter-narrative on enacting alternate agriculture practices and social practices that were believed by woman back in the 1960s.\n\nVinoba Bhave was a scholar, thinker, and writer who produced numerous books. He was a translator who made Sanskrit texts accessible to the common man. He was also an orator and linguist who had an excellent command of several languages (Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Urdu, English, Sanskrit). Bhave was an innovative social reformer. He called \"Kannada\" script the \"Queen of World Scripts\" (\"Vishwa Lipigala Raani\") He wrote brief introductions to, and criticisms of, several religious and philosophical works like the Bhagavad Gita, works of Adi Shankaracharya, the Bible and the Quran. His criticism of Dnyaneshwar's poetry and works by other Marathi saints is quite brilliant and a testimony to the breadth of his intellect.\n\nBhave had translated the Bhagavad Gita into Marathi. He was deeply influenced by the Gita and attempted to imbibe its teachings into his life, often stating that \"The Gita is my life's breath\".\n\nSome of his works are:\n\nVinoba Bhave University, located in Hazaribagh district in the state of Jharkhand, is named after him.\n\nOn 18 April 1951, Bhave started his land donation movement at Pochampally of nalgonda district Telangana, the Bhoodan Movement. He took donated land from land owner Indians and gave it away to the poor and landless, for them to cultivate. Then after 1954, he started to ask for donations of whole villages in a programme he called Gramdan. He got more than 1000 villages by way of donation. Out of these, he obtained 175 donated villages in Tamil Nadu alone. Noted Gandhian and atheist Lavanam was the interpreter for Bhave during his land reform movement in Andhra Pradesh and parts of Orissa\n\nBhave spent the later part of his life at his Brahma Vidya Mandir ashram in Paunar in Wardha district of Maharashtra. He died on 15 November 1982 after refusing food and medicine for a few days by accepting \"Samadhi Maran\" / \"Santhara\" as described in Jainism. The then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, who was visiting Moscow to attend the funeral of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, cut short her visit to be at the Bhave's funeral.\n\nV.S. Naipaul has scathingly criticised Bhave in his collection of essays citing his lack of connection with rationality and excessive imitation of Gandhi. Even some of his admirers find fault with the extent of his devotion to Gandhi. Much more controversial was his support, ranging from covert to open, to Congress Party's government under Indira Gandhi, which was fast becoming unpopular. He controversially backed the Indian Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, calling it \"Anushasana Parva\" (\"Time for Discipline\").Jayaprakash Narayan in his prison diary during the emergency sarcastically wrote about the meaning of Anushasan Parva Congress party opponents at that time had coined the derogatory term \"Sarkari Sant (Government Saint)\" to describe him. Noted Marathi writer Purushottam Laxman Deshpande publicly criticised him and mocked him by writing article titled as \"Vanaroba\" which is disambiguation of name \"Vinoba\" and literally means monkey.\nHowever, in his end days he was very much against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as she had ordered a shootout of the Sant Samaj who had undertaken a gherao of Parliament against cow slaughter. The criticism has been considered objectionable and unfounded later. By Anushasan Parva – Time for Discipline – he meant everyone to follow the rule including the rulers of that time. At a later stage he called Intelligentsia to chart a path for the ruling community and public in general. During anushasn Parva – the king has to take the permission of the great men of his time – by that he meant to put the government under the guidance of the learned. The identified persons included Late Shrimannarayan – former Governor of Gujarat and a great Gandhian of his time. They had suggested lifting of emergency. Yet the erstwhile government did not pay heed to the advice which had Vinoba Bhave's blessings and initiative.\n\nIn 1958 Bhave was the first recipient of the international Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership. He was awarded the Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1983.\n\n\n\n\n"}
