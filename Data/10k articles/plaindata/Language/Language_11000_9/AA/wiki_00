He was the youngest among six siblings. He was christened on 9 August 1821 at St. Mary, St. Marylebone, London. He was educated at a school in Finchley. He articled to George Basevi, an architect, for eight months but later joined a college Haileybury as he was appointed to Bombay Civil Service by Sir Charles Forbes in 1840. He left it in 1842 and arrived in Bombay, India in November 1843.\n\nHe spent his initial two and half years as Assistant Collector of Ahmednagar and Khandesh. Later he was appointed as Assistant Judge in Ahmedabad in November 1846 where he noted the absence of literary society. He served in different departments in Gujarat such as First Assistant Collector of Ahmedabad and Political Agent to Mahi Kantha until he went home in March 1854. During this period he collected material which was later published as \"Rasmala\". He went home in 1854 and returned at the end of 1856. He was appointed as Assistant Judge at Surat and later, in 1858, appointed on the same post at Khandesh. He want to return to Gujarat so he applied for vacant Political Agency of Kathiawar. It was turned down but later was moved to Kathiawar in September 1859 to subdue rebellion by Vaghers. The rebellion subdued by March 1860 and he returned to Surat as the Acting Judge. He was appointed as Secretary to Government in March 1861. He accepted post in Sudder Court which, in August 1862, made him one of the first six Judges of Bombay High Court which he remained till his death. He also held the honorary post of Vice Chancellor of the University of Bombay. The A. Kinloch Forbes Gold Medal was awarded for proficiency in law at LL.B. Examination of the University.\n\nHe met Dalpatram, a Gujarati poet, in 1848 who taught him Gujarati while Forbes encouraged him to write in Gujarati. They became close friends. He inspired Dalpatram to write \"Laxmi Natak\" published in 1849, the first play in Gujarati, based on Greek drama \"Plutus\".\n\nOn 26 December 1848 he started the Gujarat Vernacular Society in Ahmedabad, which contributed to a literary renaissance in Gujarati. The fund of Rs 9601 was raised from locals, Baroda State and British officers. The society started the first public library, first school for girls, first periodical, first newspaper and first literary magazine of Gujarat. He also founded Andrews Library in Surat in 1850 and Gujarati Sabha in Bombay in 1865. Gujarati Sabha was later renamed Farbas Gujarati Sabha after him. He organized conclave of Gujarati poets in 1852 at Idar State. Dalpatram's \"Farbesvilas\" was an account of these conclave. He visited many Jain libraries in search of bards who told the stories of history of Gujarat. In 1856, he published \"Râs Mâlâ: Hindoo Annals of the Province of Goozerat, in Western India\" which documented the history from 8th century to arrival of British and folk literature of Gujarat in two volumes. It was later translated into Gujarati by Ranchhodlal Udayaram Dave in 1869. He also translated Dalpatram's essay \"Bhoot Nibandh\" as \"Demonology and Popular Superstitions of Gujarat\".\n\nHe died in Poona (now Pune, Maharashtra, India) in 31 August 1865 after brief illness. Dalpatram composed \"Farbes viraha\", a Gujarati elegy in his memory.\n\nHe married Margaret-Moir Forbes-Mitchell (1825-1 November 1904), daughter of Henry David Forbes-Mitchell of Bawlgownie, in Bombay on 25 March 1846. They had six children; Edward Esme Forbes (1855-1920), Emmeline Maria Elizabeth Forbes, Margaret Theodora Lawrence Forbes (d. 1939), John Fraser Forbes (1847-1887), Henry David Erskine Forbes (1849-1920), Alexander Abernethie Forbes (b. 1851).\n"}

Dispersed recreational use is the most prevalent human use in backcountry areas, although research activities may also occur.\n\nThe NPS defines wilderness within US national parks as any \"backcountry areas which have been specifically designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System or any other area that has been determined to possess the characteristics of wilderness as defined by Section 2(c) of the Wilderness Act.\" Section 2(c) states in part that wilderness:\n\nWilderness lands within US national parks are a subset of all backcountry lands. Wilderness and backcountry lands also exist outside of US national parks on public lands managed by the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nIn New Zealand, \"backcountry\" often refers to land that is not accessible by public access. For example, it is common for a farmer to have some remote parts of his land left in scrubland or forest. This is often adjacent to other areas of backcountry which are yet to be developed or protected from development. Trampers and other explorers sometimes need to get farmers' permission to access parts of the national parks of New Zealand or other natural phenomena, if they intend to pass over backcountry. Hunters can ask for permission from farmers to hunt in their backcountry.\n\nThe backcountry contains many hazards including rough terrain, life-threatening weather, avalanches, and wild animals. Tragic accidents and dramatic backcountry rescues of stranded hikers, climbers, or skiers are a staple of news reporting.\n\nSome jurisdictions have discussed placing limits on human access to the backcountry during times of particular danger.\n\n"}

Old-fashioned cobblestones are sometimes used for crosswalks; they provide the additional benefit of slowing motorists.\n\nBeautification projects are often undertaken by city councils to refurbish their downtown areas, in order to boost tourism or other commerce. Often, this is also spurred by broken sidewalks, which pose a safety hazard for pedestrians and potentially insurmountable obstacles for wheelchair users. These projects are frequently part of other larger projects such as construction, especially in conjunction with ones for transit, such as streets and roads and mass transit.\n\nThe Laurel Hill Association of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, founded in 1853, is the oldest incorporated village beautification society in the United States.

It must be maintained within narrow limits because too little pressure could cause brain tissue to become ischemic (having inadequate blood flow), and too much could raise intracranial pressure (ICP).\n\nThe cranium encloses a fixed-volume space that holds three components: blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and very soft tissue (the brain). While both the blood and CSF have poor compression capacity, the brain is easily compressible. \n\nEvery increase of ICP can cause a change in tissue perfusion and an increase in stroke events.\nCPP can be defined as the pressure gradient causing cerebral blood flow (CBF) such that\n\nwhere:\n\nAn alternative definition of CPP is:\n\nwhere: \n\nThis definition may be more appropriate if considering the circulatory system in the brain as a Starling resistor, where an external pressure (in this case, the intracranial pressure) causes decreased blood flow through the vessels. In this sense, more specifically, the cerebral perfusion pressure can be defined as either:\nor\n\nPhysiologically, increased intracranial pressure (ICP) causes decreased blood perfusion of brain cells by mainly two mechanisms:\n\nFLOW\nRanging from 20ml 100g-1 min-1 in white matter to 70ml 100g-1 min-1 in grey matter.\n\nUnder normal circumstances a MAP between 60 to 160 mmHg and ICP about 10 mmHg (CPP of 50-150 mmHg) sufficient blood flow can be maintained with autoregulation. Although the classic 'autoregulation curve' suggests that CBF is fully stable between these blood pressure values (known also as the limits of autoregulation), in practice spontaneous fluctuations can occur.\n\nOutside of the limits of autoregulation, raising MAP raises CBF and raising ICP lowers it (this is one reason that increasing ICP in traumatic brain injury is potentially deadly). In trauma some recommend CPP not go below 70 mmHg. Recommendations in children is at least 60 mmHg.\n\nWithin the autoregulatory range, as CPP falls there is, within seconds, vasodilatation of the cerebral resistance vessels, a fall in cerebrovascular resistance and a rise in cerebral-blood volume (CBV), and therefore CBF will return to baseline value within seconds (see as ref. Aaslid, Lindegaard, Sorteberg, and Nornes 1989: http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/20/1/45.pdf). These adaptations to rapid changes in blood pressure (in contrast with changes that occur over periods of hours or days) are known as dynamic cerebral autoregulation.\n\n"}

Although a circular reference will often be unhelpful and reveal no information, such as two entries in a book index referring to each other, it is not necessarily so that a circular reference is of no use. Dictionaries, for instance, must always ultimately be a circular reference since all words in a dictionary are defined in terms of other words, but a dictionary nevertheless remains a useful reference. Sentences containing circular references can still be meaningful;\n\nis circular but not without meaning. Indeed, it can be argued that self-reference is a necessary consequence of Aristotle's Law of non-contradiction, a fundamental philosophical axiom. In this view, without self-reference, logic and mathematics become impossible, or at least, lack usefulness.\n\nCircular references can appear in computer programming when one piece of code requires the result from another, but that code needs the result from the first. For example:\n\nFunction A will show the time the sun last set based on the current date, which it can obtain by calling Function B. Function B will calculate the date based on the number of times the moon has orbited the earth since the last time Function B was called. So, Function B asks Function C just how many times that is. Function C doesn't know, but can figure it out by calling Function A to get the time the sun last set.\n\nThe entire set of functions is now worthless because none of them can return any useful information whatsoever. This leads to what is technically known as a livelock. It also appears in spreadsheets when two cells require each other's result. For example, if the value in Cell A1 is to be obtained by adding 5 to the value in Cell B1, and the value in Cell B1 is to be obtained by adding 3 to the value in Cell A1, no values can be computed. (Even if the specifications are A1:=B1+5 and B1:=A1-5, there is still a circular reference. It doesn't help that, for instance, A1=3 and B1=-2 would satisfy both formulae, as there are infinitely many other possible values of A1 and B1 that can satisfy both instances.)\n\nA circular reference represents a big problem in computing.\n\nIn ISO Standard SQL circular integrity constraints are implicitly supported within a single table. Between multiple tables circular constraints (e.g. foreign keys) are permitted by defining the constraints as deferrable (See CREATE TABLE for PostgreSQL and DEFERRABLE Constraint Examples for Oracle). In that case the constraint is checked at the end of the transaction not at the time the DML statement is executed. To update a circular reference two statements can be issued in a single transaction that will satisfy both references once the transaction is committed.\n\nA distinction should be made with processes containing a circular reference between those that are incomputable and those that are an iterative calculation with a final output. The latter may fail in spreadsheets not equipped to handle them but are nevertheless still logically valid.\n\nCircular reference in worksheets can be a very useful technique for solving implicit equations such as the Colebrook equation and many others, which might otherwise require tedious Newton-Raphson algorithms in VBA or use of macros.\n\n"}

It does not refer to the unauthorized republication by someone else, which constitutes plagiarism, copyright violation, or both. \n\nMultiple submission is not plagiarism, but it is today often viewed as academic misbehavior because it can skew meta-analyses and review articles and can distort citation indexes and citation impact by gaming the system to a degree. It was not always looked upon as harshly, as it began centuries ago and, besides the negative motive of vanity which has always been possible, it also had a legitimate motive in reaching readerships of various journals and books that were at real risk of not otherwise overlapping. \n\nThis was a print-only era before modern discoverability via the internet and digital search and before systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and citation indexes existed, and despite a few rudimentary journal clubs, it was likely for readers who subscribed to journals in one city, region, or specialty to have only sporadic contact with journals from other places or specialties. Thus redundant publication could serve a valid purpose analogous to the way that various newspapers in different cities and countries often report news items from elsewhere, ensuring that people in many places receive them despite that they do not read multiple periodicals from many other places. However, as discoverability increased in the 20th century and the aforementioned concerns arose, critical views of redundant publication, beyond merely reproaching vanity, took shape. \n\nA formalization of the policy of disallowing duplicate publications was given by Franz J. Ingelfinger, the editor of \"The New England Journal of Medicine\", in 1969. He coined the Ingelfinger rule term banning republications in the journal. Most journals follow this policy today. The \"BMJ\", for example, requires copies of any previous work with more than 10% overlap of a submission to be submitted before approving a work for publication. However, there is at least one form of publishing the same article in multiple journals that is still widely accepted, which is that some medical societies that issue joint medical guidelines will copublish those guidelines in both of the societies' official journals; for example, joint guidelines by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology are usually published in both \"Circulation\" and the \"Journal of the American College of Cardiology\". This type of dual publication is analogous to co-editions of a book.\n\nWith the advancement of the internet, there are now several tools available to aid in the detection of plagiarism and multiple publications within biomedical literature. One tool developed in 2006 by researchers in Harold Garner's laboratory at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas was Déjà Vu, an open-access database containing several thousand instances of duplicate publication.\n\nJournals sometimes choose to republish seminal articles, whether from their own past volumes, from other journals, or both. Re-publication serves the goal of bringing important information to new readerships, which makes it analogous to some instances of duplicate publication on that score. However, it is different from duplicate publication in the respect that there is no element of merely gaming the system of citation impact. Republished articles are clearly labeled as such, allowing them to be recognized as such in citation analysis.\n\n\n"}

EID looks for ways to minimize costs to the developer, while maximizing the benefit to the environment.\n\nHistorically in construction, the needs of the owner were paramount, as constrained by local laws and policies, such as building safety and zoning. EID broadens those concerns to encompass environmental impacts. Low impact development and ecologically focused building practices originated in Germany following World War II. The widespread destruction and a large homeless population gave Germans the chance to refocus building practices. Prefabrication was adopted in both East and West Germany where, in the 1950s and 60s, modular construction systems were developed for residential buildings.\n\nIn 1992, at the Earth Summit, policy makers adopted Agenda 21, which focused on sustainable development. In 1996, the UN Conference on Human Settlements Habitat II discussed transferring sustainable building practices to an urban scale. From 1999 to 2003, the U.S. Green Building Council kick-started the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design or (LEED) which is now the most well-known standard for green building.\n\nThe \"building life cycle\" is an approach to design that considers environmental impacts such as pollution and energy consumption over the life of the building. This theory evolved into the idea of cradle-to-cradle design, which adds the notion that at the end of a building's life, it should be disposed of without environment impact. The Triple Zero standard requires lowering energy, emissions and waste to zero. A successful life cycle building adopts approaches such as the use of recycled materials in the construction process as well as green energy.\n"}

{"id": "1828366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1828366", "title": "Hearts and Minds (Vietnam War)", "text": "Hearts and Minds (Vietnam War)\n\nHearts and Minds (Vietnam) or winning hearts and minds refers to the strategy and programs used by the governments of South Vietnam and the United States during the Vietnam War to win the popular support of the Vietnamese people and to help defeat the Viet Cong insurgency. Pacification is the more formal term for winning hearts and minds. Military, political, economic, and social means were used to attempt to establish or reestablish South Vietnamese government control over rural areas and people under the influence of the Viet Cong. Some progress was made in the 1967–1971 period by the joint military-civilian organization called CORDS, but the character of the war changed from an insurgency to a conventional war between the armies of South and North Vietnam. North Vietnam won in 1975.\n\nPacification or hearts and minds objectives were often in diametric opposition to the strategy of firepower, mobility, and attrition pursued by the U.S. from 1965 to 1968. Rather than the search and destroy strategy the U.S. followed during those years, hearts and minds had the priority of \"hold and protect\" the rural population and thereby gain its support for the government of South Vietnam.\n\nThe phrase \"hearts and minds\" was first used in the context of counter-insurgency warfare by British General Gerald Templer in February 1952. Speaking of the conflict known as the Malayan Emergency, Templer said that victory in the war \"lies not in pouring more soldiers into the jungle, but in the hearts and minds of the Malayan people.\" The British in Malaysia, in addition to military actions against the communist guerrillas undertook a number of social and economic programs to protect the populace, isolate the rural population to reduce their supply and support of the insurgents, gather intelligence about the insurgents' organization and plans, and ensure that government services were provided to rural dwellers.\n\nBritish action and policy in defeating the Malayan counter-insurgency became a paradigm for future struggles with insurgents, including the U.S. war in Vietnam. Critics have stated that the Malayan emergency was much simpler to combat than many insurgencies and that the impact of hearts and minds programs has often been over-stated.\n\nThe nationalist President of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem, instituted a number of programs designed to halt the growing influence of the Viet Cong in the countryside. In 1959, Diem created the Agroville program which had the objective of moving peasants into fortified villages. The program failed due to the coercive and disruptive aspects of moving peasants from their homes and requiring them to construct new ones under the supervision of government officials. The Viet Cong harassed the agrovilles with terrorism and assassinations\n\nIn 1961, the Diem government created the Strategic Hamlet Program, which differed from the Agrovilles in its emphasis on self-defense by the peasants in their fortified villages. The program in theory would prevent Viet Cong attacks by stationing South Vietnamese army (ARVN) units near the hamlets to respond quickly to threats. The strategic hamlet program was intended to gain support among the people for the government and to raise their standard of living. The program was implemented too rapidly and without popular support and many or most hamlets fell under Viet Cong control. The Strategic Hamlet Program effectively ended in November 1963 when the Diem government was overthrown by the army and Diem was killed. Most of the hamlets were subsequently abandoned and peasants moved back to their old homes.\n\nThe Strategic Hamlet Program highlighted the schism in U.S. policy that would continue throughout the Vietnam War. General Lionel C. McGarr, head of the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) in Vietnam objected to the program because it would create a static defense and tie down units of the ARVN. Conversely, the American Embassy believed that the mobile search and destroy missions by the ARVN as advocated by MAAG were only a preliminary measure to overcome the increasing Viet Cong control of the countryside.\n\nDiem's government created two other hearts and minds programs. The Chieu Hoi program encouraged defections from the Viet Cong. Diem also bolstered the South Vietnamese police and intelligence agencies to disrupt the Viet Cong infrastructure by capturing, killing, or arresting key Viet Cong operatives.\n\nThe U.S. provided assistance for the operation of all these programs, but they were primarily the creation of the South Vietnamese.\n\nKennedy was already imbued with the philosophy of counter-insurgency when he took office as President in January 1961.\nHe quickly expanded the Army's special forces, but army leadership was reluctant to endorse Kennedy's vision of combined military, economic, and social action to defeat the Viet Cong insurgency. General George Decker reportedly told Kennedy that \"any good soldier can handle guerrillas\" and the Army placed a priority on strengthening the ARVN rather than the police, militia, and para-military forces. Pacification or hearts and minds programs were only a minor factor contributing to the steady increase of U.S. advisers and other military personnel in Vietnam. The U.S. military command was optimistic that the assistance given to the South Vietnamese army was bearing fruit. The first commander of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) Paul D. Harkins, a proponent of conventional warfare, predicted that \"the military phase of the war can be virtually won in 1963.\"\n\nKennedy was assassinated in November 1963, three weeks after the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem. Kennedy adviser Roger Hilsman stated that \"The Kennedy administration had developed a concept for fighting guerrilla warfare, an idea for a political program into which military measures were meshed, but we had failed so far to convince the Diem regime or even the top levels of the Pentagon to give it a fair trial.\"\n\nNew governments in Washington and Saigon created new pacification programs in 1964 as it became clear that, contrary to the U.S.'s optimism of 1963, the Viet Cong were steadily taking control of more territory and more people. British counter-insurgency expert Robert Grainger Ker Thompson said that the government's survival was at stake. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara said in May 1964 that he could not understand \"how the Viet Cong continually attacked and overran hamlets that the government and MACV listed as secure.\"\n\nThe next iteration of the pacification program came in 1964 with, for the first time, the direct participation in planning and execution by the American Embassy and MAC/V, now headed by General William Westmoreland. The \"Chien Thang\" (Struggle for Victory) pacification program was less ambitious than the Strategic Hamlet program, envisioning a gradual expansion, like an \"oil spot\" from government-controlled to communist controlled areas, by providing security and services to rural areas. Along with the Chien Thang program was the related \"Hop Tac\" (Victory) program, directly involving the U.S. military in pacification for the first time. Hop Tac envisioned a gradual expansion outward from Saigon of areas under South Vietnamese government control. These programs also failed as the South Vietnamese army was unable to provide adequate security to rural residents in disputed areas.\n\nIn 1965, with the government of South Vietnam failing, the U.S. became directly involved in the war with a large infusion of American combat troops. Pacification programs took a back seat to Westmoreland's strategy of attrition—attempting to kill Viet Cong and an increasing number of North Vietnamese Army troops with search and destroy missions that utilized U.S. advantages in mobility and firepower. To defeat the Viet Cong, Westmoreland expressed his strategy in one word: \"Firepower.\"\n\nDoubts about the wisdom of the attrition strategy were expressed by many U.S. officials and military officers. A 1966 internal army study led by General Creighton Abrams concluded that pacification should be the main priority of the U.S. in Vietnam and that the U.S. Ambassador should have \"unequivocal authority\" over all U.S. activities, including military, in Vietnam. Westmoreland succeeded in squashing any implementation of the recommendations in the study.\n\nThe growing American military presence in 1965 prevented an outright military victory by the Viet Cong and the increasingly present North Vietnamese army. General Nguyen Duc Thang led government pacification programs, creating the Revolutionary Development Cadre of young people recruited to serve in teams in the rural areas to improve both security and government services. The numbers of revolutionary cadre reached 21,000 in 1967 but desertions and those killed by the Viet Cong were high. The local defense forces, called the Regional Force and the Popular Force were expanded in numbers from about 200,000 to 300,000 members in 1966. The Ruff-Puffs, as they were called by Americans, were responsible for maintaining security in villages under government control. Their casualties during the war exceeded those of the ARVN.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson shared President Kennedy's conviction that pacification was important in the Vietnam war. In February 1966, Johnson at a meeting with South Vietnamese and American leaders in Hawaii attempted to \"get the gospel of pacification carved into the hearts and minds of all concerned.\" That signaled the beginning of a renewed effort by the U.S. to win hearts and minds in South Vietnam.\n\nReferring to Vietnam, President Johnson used some version of the phrase \"hearts and minds\" a total of 28 times. In ten of these instances, Johnson inverted the words and used the phrase \"minds and hearts.\" The first time he used the phrase in his presidency was on 16 January 1964, and the last time was 19 August 1968. In his usage he addressed very different audiences, including heads of state, congressmen, and the American people. Also, Johnson referred to the \"hearts and minds\" of disparate groups, including the above-mentioned audiences and even humanity as a whole. His use of the phrase is most commonly taken from the speech \"Remarks at a Dinner Meeting of the Texas Electric Cooperatives, Inc.\" on 4 May 1965. On that evening he said, \"So we must be ready to fight in Vietnam, but the ultimate victory will depend upon the hearts and the minds of the people who actually live out there. By helping to bring them hope and electricity you are also striking a very important blow for the cause of freedom throughout the world.\"\n\nJohnson’s use of the phrase is most likely based on a quote of John Adams, the American Revolutionary War patriot and second president of the United States, who wrote in a letter dated 13 February 1818: \"The Revolution was effected before the War commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people; a change in their religious sentiments of their duties and obligations…. This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people, was the real American Revolution\". There was however an earlier use of the phrase, albeit rarely acknowledged in this context. John Adams was an educated man who had gone to Harvard and graduated in 1755 with an A.B., and in 1758 with an A.M., what are today known as Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts respectively. It is therefore a reasonable assumption to believe that he was familiar with Shakespeare's use of the term as part of Mark Antony's speech to the crowd, just after Brutus's. Mark Antony says thus – \"O masters, if I were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage...\"\n\nIn 1966, Johnson appointed CIA official and National Security Council member Robert W. Komer (\"Blowtorch Bob\") as his special assistant for supervising pacification in South Vietnam. Komer's challenge was to unite the U.S government agencies—the military, Department of State, CIA, and the Agency for International Development— involved in pacification projects. Komer recommended the responsibility for pacification be vested in MAC/V, headed by General Westmoreland, through a civilian deputy who would head the U.S. pacification effort commanding both U.S. military and civilian personnel. Although his proposal was unpopular in all the agencies, Komer, with the support of Johnson, pressed forward. As a halfway measure the Office of Civil Operations (OCO) was set up with civilian leadership in November 1966 to coordinate all civilian pacification programs. OCO failed but strengthened Komer and Johnson's view that MAC/V leadership of the pacification program was essential.\n\nKomer argued that the pacification success desired by President Johnson could only be achieved by integrating three tasks. The first and most basic requirement for pacification had to be security, because the rural population had to be kept isolated from the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese army. If this was to be achieved, the insurgents had to be weakened both by destroying their infrastructure among the rural population and by developing programs to win their hearts and minds and gain support or at least toleration of the South Vietnamese government and the U.S. military forces. The third point emphasized by Komer was that the new strategy had to be applied on a large scale in order to turn around what had been up until then a war in which the insurgents held the initiative.\n\nOrganizationally, in Komer's view, the pacification goals required that efforts be concentrated under a single command. He believed that only the U.S. military had the resources and personnel to implement a large-scale pacification plan. After initial reservations, Westmoreland agreed with the plan, but civilian agencies still balked. They feared being marginalized and overwhelmed by the U.S. military with its much larger number of personnel and greater resources. Johnson overruled them and on 9 May 1967, the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support organization (CORDS) was created. Komer was appointed one of Westmoreland's three deputy commanders with the title of Ambassador and the equivalent rank of a three-star general. This was the first time in U.S. history that an ambassador had served under a military command and been given authority over military personnel and resources.\n\nKomer chose a military officer as his deputy and repeated the pattern of having either a civilian in charge of every component of CORDS with a military deputy or, alternatively, a military commander with a civilian deputy. He consolidated all the diverse pacification and civil affairs programs in Vietnam—military and civilian—under the authority of CORDS. Starting with a staff of 4,980, CORDS expanded to 8,327 personnel in the first six months of its operation. In 1968 CORDS was working in all 44 provinces and eventually was functioning in all 250 districts of Vietnam. About 85 percent of CORDS personnel were military, the remainder civilians. Each province was headed by a Vietnamese province chief, usually a colonel, who was supported by an American provincial senior adviser. The adviser’s staff was divided into a civilian part which supervised area and community development and a military part which handled security issues.\n\nOn January 24, 1968, Komer warned that \"something is in the wind.\" Seven days later the Tet Offensive was launched by the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese army. Tet weakened the Saigon government's presence in the countryside which had been aided by CORDS. The Regional and Popular Forces abandoned the countryside in some areas to defend cities and towns, suffering more than 6,500 casualties, including desertions. Tet was a psychological and strategic defeat for South Vietnam and its American ally, but by resulting in heavy Viet Cong casualties facilitated an early return to the countryside by South Vietnamese authorities and CORDS. Project Recovery distributed food and construction material to rural dwellers and involved CORDS in reconstruction efforts in the cities and towns. By May 1968, the rural population living in \"relatively secure\" hamlets had returned to pre-Tet levels of 67 percent.\n\nA new U.S. team in Vietnam promoted expanded hearts and minds programs. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker supported pacification programs; General Creighton Abrams replaced Westmoreland as MACV commander; and William Colby replaced Komer as Abrams' deputy commander for pacification.\n\nAbrams called his strategy for persecuting the war the \"one war concept.\" In Abrams' words, the U.S. would focus \"upon protecting the population so that the civil government can establish its authority as opposed to an earlier conception of the purpose of war – destruction of the enemy's forces.\" Abrams' one war concept encountered opposition from U.S. army generals in Vietnam and in Washington and he was unable to effect all the changes in U.S. military strategy he proposed. Abram's push for the adoption of his plan was overtaken by events as the U.S. military began withdrawing in 1969, but the government of South Vietnam adopted many elements of his plan.\n\nWith Abram's and Bunker's support, and aided by the casualties the Viet Cong suffered in 1968, CORDS commander Colby reported substantial progress in pacification from 1969 to 1972. U.S. resources devoted to pacification increased dramatically and by early 1970, CORDS reported that 93 percent of rural dwellers in Vietnam lived in \"relatively secure villages.\" North Vietnamese documents suggest that one reason for the 1972 North Vietnamese offensive was to reverse the progress made in pacification. CORDS, and U.S. participation in hearts and minds programs, effectively ended after the withdrawal from Vietnam of the last U.S. ground forces in August 1972.\n\nThe success of hearts and minds programs in Vietnam was ambiguous in the words of Richard A. Hunt in his book \"Pacification\". The high-level officials in the CORDS program claimed large successes. Some historians, however, maintain that pacification programs failed to dislodge the Viet Cong from their position of strength in the countryside.\n\nAfter a long history of failed pacification programs, the successes reported for CORDS in the 1968–1972 period were partially attributable to the heavy casualties the Viet Cong suffered during the Tet Offensive and subsequent actions in 1968. The number of Viet Cong guerrillas is estimated to have been reduced from 77,000 in 1968 before Tet to 25,000 in 1972 and the Viet Cong infrastructure from 84,000 to 56,000. However, although the number of battalion-size battles declined, the number of small unit actions by the Viet Cong nearly doubled during the same time period. Illustrating the impact of hearts and minds (as believed by its advocates). In January 1972 Ambassador Bunker warned that the communists would have to \"mount a major military offensive...to prove his public claims that Vietnamization and pacification are failures.\" True to Bunker's prediction, on March 30, 1972, North Vietnam launched its Easter Offensive. Although South Vietnam, with American air support, withstood the offensive, the North Vietnamese army gained control over sizable areas of South Vietnamese territory and displaced more than one million people.\n\nKomer attributed the ultimate failure of hearts and minds programs in South Vietnam to the bureaucratic culture of the United States in addition to the administrative and military shortcomings of the South Vietnamese government. A counter-insurgency strategy for Vietnam was proposed from the earliest days of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, notably by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, but there was an \"immense gap between policy and performance.\" Early efforts to implement hearts and minds programs in Vietnam were small scale compared to the resources and manpower devoted to fighting a conventional war. Even after the creation of CORDS in 1967, \"pacification remained a small tail to the very large conventional military dog. It was never tried on a large enough scale until too late.\"\n\nKomer also criticized U.S. institutions for relying on conventional tactics and strategy in an unconventional, political war. \"Instead of adapting to the Vietnamese situation, we fought the enemy our way at horrendous costs, and with some tragic side effects, because we lacked much capability to do otherwise...Institutional inertia\" prevailed.\" CIA officer and later CIA Director William Colby said \"The Pentagon had to fight the only war it knew how to fight, and there was no American organization that could fight any other.\"\n\nA negative view about pacification in Vietnam was expressed by Richard Neustadt. \"It was naive to claim that the United States could achieve victory with limited means in a civil war on the Asian mainland. It was equally naive, I think, to assume that we could change or win the hearts and minds of people, democratize a country not remotely under our own control, and thus aim at nationhood through Saigon's government. American military forces and civilian bureaucracies are not finely tuned enough for such assignments.\"\n\n\n\n"}

ITI is affiliated with the International Federation of Translators (FIT).\n\nITI was founded in 1986, as a breakaway group from the Institute of Linguists (now the CIoL) and successor to the IOL's \"Translators' Guild\". As the principal professional association of translators and interpreters in the United Kingdom, it has become one of the primary sources of information on translation and interpreting to government, industry, the media and the public. It was one of the bodies consulted regarding the creation of the EN 15038 European quality standard for the provision of translation services.\n\nThe Institute of Translation & Interpreting aims to promote the highest standards in the translation and interpreting professions. It achieves this through the publication of a bimonthly bulletin and pamphlets, the organization of regular conferences and courses linked to Continuing Professional Development, rigorous criteria for full membership including examinations and peer assessment, and a mentoring scheme for newcomers to the profession. The institute also worked together with the CIoL on the establishment and administration of the new designation of Chartered Linguist, as well as collaborating with numerous other UK-based interpreting organizations in the umbrella body Professional Interpreters for Justice (PI4J/PIJ), to campaign against the new Ministry of Justice framework agreement for public service interpreting.\n\nAlthough most of its members are based in the United Kingdom, ITI has members from across continental Europe and other countries where English is commonly used. The main grades of individual membership are Fellow, Qualified Member, Associate, Graduate Affiliate, Career Affiliate and Student, and there are categories for individual Supporters and Academics, with some Corporate Members, classified into Corporate - Language Services Business, Corporate Education and Corporate Affiliate. In November 2007 the numbers at each level were 30 Fellows, 1421 Members, 987 Associates, 85 Students and 77 Corporates, with a further 7 honorary and 35 concessionary members, making a total of 2642. Members are bound by the institute's Code of Professional Conduct. Fellows and Qualified Members are entitled to use the postnominals FITI and MITI; the equivalent AITI for Associates was abolished when the precise definition of 'Associate' changed several times in around 2005, but was reinstated in 2013.\n\nThe bulletin is published bi-monthly and has an estimated readership of 7000. As well as publicising ITI events, including conferences, workshops etc., it contains articles relating to translating and interpreting. Some editions include interviews with authors and articles on world issues running alongside regular features on the pitfalls of poor translation, reviews of translation software, taxation, money matters, and the many uses of translation and interpreting.\n\nFrom the beginning, ITI members have sought to form groups based on regional, language and specialist lines. ITI has regional groups that span the United Kingdom, such as the ITI Scottish Network and ITI London Regional Group. Language groups such as the German Network, French Network and Japanese Network (J-Net), as well as subject-based networks such as STEP and infotech, maintain internet-based groups for purposes such as the clarification of terminological queries, discussion of best practice, sharing work, and organizing social events.\n\n"}

The predominant language in China, which is divided into seven major language groups (classified as dialects by the Chinese government for political reasons), is known as \"Hanyu\" () and its study is considered a distinct academic discipline in China. \"Hanyu\", or Han language, spans eight primary varieties, that differ from each other morphologically and phonetically to such a degree that they will often be mutually unintelligible, similarly to English and German or Danish. The languages most studied and supported by the state include Chinese, Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur and Zhuang. China has 299 living languages listed at Ethnologue. According to the 2010 edition of the \"Nationalencyklopedin\", 955 million out of China's then-population of 1.34 billion spoke some variety of Mandarin Chinese as their first language, accounting for 71% of the country's population.\n\nStandard Chinese (known in China as \"Putonghua\"), a form of Mandarin Chinese, is the official national spoken language for the mainland and serves as a lingua franca within the Mandarin-speaking regions (and, to a lesser extent, across the other regions of mainland China). Several other autonomous regions have additional official languages. For example, Tibetan has official status within the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Mongolian has official status within Inner Mongolia. Language laws of China do not apply to either Hong Kong or Macau, which have different official languages (Cantonese, English and Portuguese) than the mainland.\n\nThe spoken languages of nationalities that are a part of the People's Republic of China belong to at least nine families:\n\n\nBelow are lists of ethnic groups in China by linguistic classification. Ethnicities not on the official PRC list of 56 ethnic groups are italicized. Respective Pinyin transliterations and Chinese characters (both simplified and traditional) are also given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following languages traditionally had written forms that do not involve Chinese characters (\"hanzi\"):\n\n\nMany modern forms of spoken Chinese languages have their own distinct writing system using Chinese characters that contain colloquial variants.\nThese typically are used as sound characters to help determine the pronunciation of the sentence within that language:\n\nSome formerly have used Chinese characters\n\n\nDuring Qing dynasty, palaces, temples, and coins have sometimes been inscribed in five scripts:\n\nDuring the Mongol Yuan dynasty, the official writing system was:\nChinese banknotes contain several scripts in addition to Chinese script. These are:\n\nOther writing system for Chinese languages in China include:\n\nTen nationalities who never had a written system have, under the PRC's encouragement, developed phonetic alphabets. According to a government white paper published in early 2005, \"by the end of 2003, 22 ethnic minorities in China used 28 written languages.\"\n\nThe Chinese language policy in mainland China is heavily influenced by the Soviet nationalities policy and officially encourages the development of standard spoken and written languages for each of the nationalities of China. However, in this schema, Han Chinese are considered a single nationality and the official policy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) treats the different varieties of Chinese differently from the different national languages, even though their differences are as significant as those between the various Romance languages of Europe.\nWhile official policies in mainland China encourage the development and use of different orthographies for the national languages and their use in educational and academic settings, realistically speaking it would seem that, as elsewhere in the world, the outlook for\nminority languages perceived as inferior is grim.\nThe Tibetan Government-in-Exile argue that social pressures and political efforts result in a policy of sinicization and feels that Beijing should promote the Tibetan language more.\nBecause many languages exist in China, they also have problems regarding diglossia. Recently, in terms of Fishman's typology of the relationships between bilingualism and diglossia and his taxonomy of diglossia (Fishman 1978, 1980) in China: more and more minority communities have been evolving from \"diglossia without bilingualism\" to \"bilingualism without diglossia.\" This could be an implication of mainland China's power expanding.\n\nIt is also considered increasingly prestigious and useful to have some ability in English, which is a required subject for persons attending university. During the 1950s and 1960s, Russian had some social status among elites in mainland China as the international language of socialism. Japanese is the second most-studied foreign language in China.\n\nIn the late 1960s, English replaced the position of Russian to become the most important foreign language in China. After the Reform and Opening-up policy in 1988, English is taught in the public schools starting in the third year of primary school, languages other than English are now considered to be \"minor languages\" (小语种 ; Traditional Chinese:小語種 \"xiǎo yǔzhǒng\") and are only really studied at the university level apart from some special schools which are called Foreign Language Schools in some well-developed cities. Japanese and Korean are not considered as \"minor languages\" by most of the Chinese people. Russian, French, and German are widely taught in universities and colleges nowadays.\n\nIn Northeast China, there are many bilingual schools (Mandarin-Japanese; Mandarin-Korean; Mandarin-Russian), in these schools, students learn other languages other than English.\n\n\"The Economist\", issue April 12, 2006, reported that up to one fifth of the population is learning English. Gordon Brown, the former British Prime Minister, estimated that the total English-speaking population in China will outnumber the native speakers in the rest of the world in two decades.\n\nLiterary Arabic is studied by Hui students.\n\nLiterary Arabic education was promoted in Islamic schools by the Kuomintang when it ruled mainland China.\n\nPortuguese is taught in Macau as one of the official languages there and as a center of learning of the language in the region, although use has declined drastically since its transfer from Portugal to the PRC.\n\nIn Mainland China, English is used as a lingua franca in several fields, including in business settings, and in schools to teach Standard Mandarin to people who are not Chinese citizens.\n\n\n\n"}

Stamps on the miniature sheet can be in se-tenant position while the same stamps were not se-tenants in regular issue.\n\nBoth the stamps and the entire sheet are valid for mailing, although they are almost always sold above face value and kept in mint collection by collectors; a handful of usages may be found as philatelic covers.\n\nLuxembourg issued the first generally recognized souvenir sheet in 1923, a single 10-franc stamp, not otherwise available, inset in a larger blank sheet. The purpose was to honor the birth of Princess Elisabeth. However, this country had produced a somewhat similar issue in 1921, a small sheet of 5 stamps to celebrate the birth of Prince Jean, and an even earlier sheet of 10 stamps for the accession of William IV in 1906. Neither had margin inscriptions and both consisted of regular issue stamps that were otherwise available. Since the 1920s many other countries have produced souvenir sheets. The United States issued its first one in 1926, and printed several more in the 1930s, with new ones occasionally issued since that time. Starting in 1955 the United Nations has occasionally produced them.\n\nWhile some of the earliest souvenir sheets are valuable (for instance in excellent condition the US White Plains sheet of 1926 is worth hundreds of dollars), modern ones are typically produced in considerable quantities and have no special value.\n\n"}

When entire scenes are redone, it is referred to as a re-shoot. Both types of shots usually occur after continuity, logic, or quality issues are identified during the film editing process. In other words, such shots occur months after the sets have been struck, the costumes and props have been stored, and all the cast and most of the crew have moved on to other projects. If the issues had been identified during principal photography, the director would simply have asked for another take. Therefore, the director and producer must carefully balance the substantial expense of reuniting key cast and crew members on set against whether pick-ups or re-shoots are absolutely necessary to fix plot holes (or worse) in the final cut. \n\nThe three movies in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson, were filmed back to back and used pick-up shots. The three films in \"The Hobbit\" trilogy, also directed by Jackson, used similar techniques.\n\nNews reporting uses the related but distinctly different concept of \"insert\" or \"reaction shots\". These differ from pick-up shots in that they are merely new takes made immediately after the original recording they are used to augment, while pick-ups or reshoots are made much later as an entirely separate recording session. \n\nLocal news stations typically send just one remote camera to cover a story, a practice called PSC, or Portable Single Camera. After recording an interview, if there is time (i.e., the reporter is not covering breaking news that must be broadcast immediately), the subject is then asked to \"react to questions\" and the camera records those additional shots. The reactions from angles other than the original shoot are then edited into the interview's final cut, which then looks less boring than single-angle shots of the interview subject.\n\n"}

It uses large poles or posts buried in the ground or on a foundation to provide the vertical structural support, along with girts to provide horizontal support. The method was developed and matured during the 1930s as agricultural practices changed, including the shift toward engine-powered farm equipment and the demand for cheaper, larger barns and storage areas.\n\nPole building design was pioneered in the 1930s in the United States originally using utility poles for horse barns and agricultural buildings. The depressed value of agricultural products in the 1920s and 1930s and the emergence of large, corporate farming in the 1930s created a demand for larger, cheaper agricultural buildings. As the practice took hold, rather than using utility poles, materials such as pole barn nails were developed specifically for this type of construction, making the process more affordable and reliable. Today, almost any low-rise structure can be quickly built using the post-frame construction method.\n\nPole barn construction was a quick and economical method of adding outbuildings on a farm as agriculture shifted to equipment-dependent and capital-intensive agriculture—necessitating shelter for tractors, harvesters, wagons and the like in much greater quantities and sizes. Around North America, many pole-built structures are still readily seen in rural and industrial areas.\n\nPoles, from which these buildings get their name, are natural shaped or round wooden timbers in diameter. The structural frame of a pole building is made of tree trunks, utility poles, engineered lumber or chemically pressure treated squared timbers which may be buried in the ground or anchored to a concrete slab. Generally the posts are evenly spaced apart except to allow for doors. Buried posts have the benefit of providing lateral stability so no braces are needed. Buried posts may be driven into the ground or set in holes then filled with soil, crushed stone, or concrete.\n\nPole buildings may not have walls but be open shelters, such as for farm animals or equipment or for use as picnic shelters.\n\nEnclosed pole buildings have exterior curtain walls formed by girts fastened to the exterior of the posts at intervals about on center that carry the siding and any interior load. The walls may be designed as a shear wall to provide structural stability. Other girt systems include framing in between the posts rather than on the outer side of the posts. Siding materials for a pole building are most commonly rolled-rib 29-gauge enameled steel cut to length in widths attached using color-matched screws with rubber washers to seal the holes. However, any standard siding can be used, including T1-11, vinyl, lap siding, cedar and even brick. Using sidings other than metal may require first installing sheathing, such plywood, oriented strand board or boards.\n\nOn two walls, usually the long walls, the dimensional lumber girts at the top of the walls are doubled, one on the inside and one on the outside of the posts, and usually through-bolted with large carriage bolts to support the roof load. The roof structure is frequently a truss roof supporting purlins or laths, or built using common rafters. Wide buildings with common rafters need interior rows of posts. Sometimes rafters may be attached directly to the poles. The roof pitch of pole buildings is usually low and the roof form is usually gable or lean-to. Metal roofing is commonly used as the roofing and siding material on pole buildings.\n\nThe floor may be soil, concrete slab, or framed of wood.\n\nIn modern developments the pole barns of the 1930s have become \"pole buildings\" for use as housing, commercial use, churches, picnic shelters or storage buildings. In the process more often than not, the poles have become posts of squared-off, pressure-treated timbers. These structures have the potential to replicate the functionality of other buildings, but they may be more affordable and require less time to construct. The most common use for pole buildings is storage buildings as it was on the farms, but today they may be for the storage of automobiles, boats, and RVs along with many other household items that would normally be found in a residential garage, or commercially as the surroundings for a light industry or small corporate offices with attached shops.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1130951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1130951", "title": "Scribal abbreviation", "text": "Scribal abbreviation\n\nScribal abbreviations or sigla (singular: siglum) are the abbreviations used by ancient and medieval scribes writing in Latin, and later in Greek and Old Norse. In modern manuscript editing (substantive and mechanical) \"sigla\" are the symbols used to indicate the source manuscript (e.g. variations in text between different such manuscripts) and to identify the copyist(s) of a work. See Critical apparatus.\n\nAbbreviated writing, using \"sigla\", arose partly from the limitations of the workable nature of the materials (stone, metal, parchment, etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability. Thus, lapidaries, engravers, and copyists made the most of the available writing space. Scribal abbreviations were infrequent when writing materials were plentiful, but by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, writing materials were scarce and costly.\n\nDuring the Roman Republic, several abbreviations, known as \"sigla\" (plural of \"siglum\" = symbol or abbreviation), were in common use in inscriptions, and they increased in number during the Roman Empire. Additionally, in this period shorthand entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian Xenophon in the memoir of Socrates, and it was called \"notae socratae\". In the late Roman Republic, the Tironian notes were developed possibly by Marcus Tullius Tiro, Cicero's amanuensis, in 63 BC to record information with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the Latin minuscule hand and square and rustic capital letters. The notation was akin to modern stenographic writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, and it could be used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the Carolingians, who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a \"murky existence\" (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by Johannes Trithemius, abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery (\"notae benenses\").\n\nTo learn the Tironian note system, scribes required formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; this later increased to some 5,000 symbols and then to some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD); the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. \"Sigla\" were mostly used in lapidary inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent that some are indecipherable.\n\nThe abbreviations were not constant but changed from region to region. Scribal abbreviations increased in usage and reached their height in the Carolingian Renaissance (8th to 10th centuries). The most common abbreviations, called \"notae communes\", were used across most of Europe, but others appeared in certain regions. In legal documents, legal abbreviations, called \"notae juris\", appear but also capricious abbreviations, which scribes manufactured \"ad hoc\" to avoid repeating names and places in a given document.\n\nScribal abbreviations can be found in epigraphy, sacred and legal manuscripts, written in Latin or in a vernacular tongue (but less frequently and with fewer abbreviations), either calligraphically or not.\n\nIn epigraphy, common abbreviations were comprehended in two observed classes:\n\nBoth forms of abbreviation are called \"suspensions\" (as the scribe suspends the writing of the word). A separate form of abbreviation is by \"contraction\" and was mostly a Christian usage for sacred words, Nomina Sacra; non-Christian sigla usage usually limited the number of letters the abbreviation comprised and omitted no intermediate letter. One practice was rendering an overused, formulaic phrase only as a siglum: DM for \"Dis Manibus\" (\"Dedicated to the Manes\"); IHS from the first three letters of \"ΙΗΣΟΥΣ\"; and RIP for \"requiescat in pace\" (\"Rest in Peace\") because the long-form written usage of the abbreviated phrase, by itself, was rare. According to Trabe, these abbreviations are not really meant to lighten the burden of the scribe but rather to shroud in reverent obscurity the holiest words of the Christian religion.\n\nAnother practice was repeating the abbreviation's final consonant a given number of times to indicate a group of as many persons: AVG denoted \"Augustus\", thus, AVGG denoted \"Augusti duo\"; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using COSS to denote \"Consulibus duobus\", they invented the CCSS form. Still, when occasion required referring to three or four persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a \"vinculum\" (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage. Likewise the \"tilde\" (~), an undulated, curved-end line, came into standard late-medieval usage.\n\nBesides the \"tilde\" and macron marks, above and below letters, modifying cross-bars and extended strokes were employed as scribal abbreviation marks, mostly for prefixes and verb, noun and adjective suffixes. The \"typographic\" abbreviations should not be confused with the \"phrasal\" abbreviations: i.e. (\"id est\" — \"that is\"); loc. cit. (\"loco citato\" — \"in the passage already cited\"); viz. (\"vide licet\" — \"namely\", \"that is to say\", \"in other words\" — formed with \"vi\" and the \"yogh\"-like glyph [Ꝫ], [ꝫ], the siglum for the suffix -et and the conjunction et) and et cetera.\n\nMoreover, besides scribal abbreviations, ancient texts also contained variant typographic characters, including ligatures (e.g. Æ, Œ, etc.), the long s (ſ), and the half r, resembling an Arabic numeral two (\"2\"). The \"u\" and \"v\" characters originated as scribal variants for their respective letters, likewise the \"i\" and \"j\" pair. Modern publishers printing Latin-language works replace variant typography and sigla with full-form Latin spellings; the convention of using \"u\" and \"i\" for vowels and \"v\" and \"j\" for consonants is a late typographic development.\n\nSome ancient and medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin ampersand (&) replaces the conjunction \"and\" in English, \"et\" in Latin and French, and \"y\" in Spanish (but its use in Spanish is frowned upon, since the \"y\" is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign ⁊, resembling the digit seven (\"7\"), represents the conjunction \"et\" and is written only to the x-height; in current Irish language usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction \"agus\" (\"and\"). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the percentage sign (%), from the Italian \"per cento\" (\"per hundred\"); the permille sign (‰), from the Italian \"per mille\" (\"per thousand\"); the pound sign (₤, £ and #, all descending from ℔ or lb, \"librum\") and the dollar sign ($), which possibly derives from the Spanish word \"Peso\". The commercial at symbol (@), originally denoting \"at the rate/price of\", is a ligature derived from the English preposition \"at\"; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of e-mail addresses.\n\nTypographically, the ampersand (\"&\"), representing the word \"et\", is a space-saving ligature of the letters \"e\" and \"t\", its component graphemes. Since the establishment of movable-type printing in the 15th century, founders have created many such ligatures for each set of record type (font) to communicate much information with fewer symbols. Moreover, during the Renaissance (14th to 17th centuries), when Ancient Greek language manuscripts introduced that tongue to Western Europe, its scribal abbreviations were converted to ligatures in imitation of the Latin scribal writing to which readers were accustomed. Later, in the 16th century, when the culture of publishing included Europe's vernacular languages, Graeco-Roman scribal abbreviations disappeared, an ideologic deletion ascribed to the anti-Latinist Protestant Reformation (1517–1648).\n\nThe common abbreviation \"Xmas,\" for Christmas, is a remnant of an old scribal abbreviation that substituted the Greek letter chi (Χ, resembling Latin X and representing the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Χριστος) for the word Christ.\n\nAfter the invention of printing, manuscript copying abbreviations continued to be employed in Church Slavonic and are still in use in printed books as well as on icons and inscriptions. Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special diacritic symbol titlo, as shown in the figure at the right. That corresponds to the Nomina sacra (Latin: \"Sacred names\") tradition of using contractions for certain frequently-occurring names in Greek ecclesiastical texts. However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to \"good\" beings and the same words, when referring to \"bad\" beings, are spelled out; for example, while \"God\" in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as \"\", \"god\" referring to \"false\" gods is spelled out. Likewise, the word for \"angel\" is generally abbreviated as \"\", but the word for \"angels\" is spelled out for \"performed by evil angels\" in Psalm 77.\n\nAdriano Cappelli's \"Lexicon Abbreviaturarum\", enumerates the various medieval brachigraphic signs found in Latin and Italian vulgar texts, which originate from the Roman sigla, a symbol to express a word, and Tironian notes. Quite rarely, abbreviations did not carry marks to indicate that an abbreviation has occurred: if they did, they were often copying errors. For example, \"e.g.\" is written with periods, but modern terms, such as \"PC\", may be written in uppercase.\n\nIt should be noted that the original manuscripts were not written in a modern sans-serif or serif font but in Roman capitals, rustic, uncial, insular, Carolingian or blackletter styles. For more, refer to Western calligraphy or a beginner's guide.\n\nAdditionally, the abbreviations employed varied across Europe. In Nordic texts, for instance, two runes were used in text written in the Latin alphabet, which are ᚠ for \"fé\" \"cattle, goods\" and ᛘ for \"maðr\" \"man\".\n\nCappelli divides abbreviations into six overlapping categories:\n\nSuspended terms are those of which only the first part is written, and the last part is substituted by a mark, which can be of two types:\n\nThe largest class of suspensions consists of single letters standing in for words that begin with that letter.\n\nA dot at the baseline after a capital letter may stand for a title if it is used such as in front of names or a person's name in medieval legal documents. However, not all sigla use the beginning of the word.\nFor plural words, the siglum is often doubled: \"F.\" = \"frater\" and \"FF.\" = \"fratres\". Tripled sigla often stand for three: \"DDD\" = \"domini tres\".\n\nLetters lying on their sides, or mirrored (backwards), often indicate female titles, but a mirrored C, Ↄ, stands generally for \"con\" or \"contra\" (the latter sometimes with a macron above, \"Ↄ̄\").\n\nTo avoid confusion with abbreviations and numerals, the latter are often written with a bar above. In some contexts, however, numbers with a line above indicate that number is to be multiplied by a thousand, and several other abbreviations also have a line above them, such as \"ΧΡ\" (Greek letters chi+rho) = \"Christus\" or \"IHS\" = \"Jesus\".\n\nStarting in the 8th or the 9th century, single letter sigla grew less common and were replaced by longer, less-ambiguous sigla, with bars above them.\n\nAbbreviations by contraction have one or more middle letters omitted. They were often represented with a general mark of abbreviation (above), such as a line above. They can be divided into two subtypes:\n\nSuch marks inform the reader of the identity of the missing part of the word without affecting (\"independent\" of) the meaning. Some of them may be interpreted as alternative contextual glyphs of their respective letters.\n\nThe meaning of the marks depends on the letter on which they appear.\n\nA superscript letter generally referred to the letter omitted, but, in some instances, as in the case of vowel letters, it could refer to a missing vowel combined with the letter \"r\", before or after it. It is only in some English dialects that the letter \"r\" before another consonant largely silent and the preceding vowel is \"r-coloured\".\n\nHowever, \"a\", \"i\", and \"o\" above \"g\" meant \"gͣ\" \"gna\", \"gͥ\" \"gni\" and \"gͦ\" \"gno\" respectively. Although in English, the \"g\" is silent in \"gn\", but in other languages, it is pronounced. Vowel letters above \"q\" meant \"qu\" + vowel: \"qͣ\", \"qͤ\", \"qͥ\", \"qͦ\", \"qͧ\".\n\n\nVowels were the most common superscripts, but consonants could be placed above letters without ascenders; the most common were \"c\", e.g. \"nͨ\". A cut \"l\" above an \"n\", \"nᷝ\", meant \"nihil\" for instance.\n\nThese marks are nonalphabetic letters carrying a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, as in the case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as \"letter-like glyphs\". Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of the words for those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are alchemical and zodiac symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.\n\nIn addition to the signs used to signify abbreviations, medieval manuscripts feature some glyphs that are now uncommon but were not sigla.\nMany more ligatures were used to reduce the space occupied, a characteristic that is particularly prominent in blackletter scripts.\nSome such as r rotunda, long s and uncial or insular variants (Insular G), Claudian letters were in common use, as well as letters derived from other scripts such as Nordic runes: thorn (þ=th) and eth (ð=dh).\nAn illuminated manuscript would feature miniatures, decorated initials or \"littera notabilior\", which later resulted in the bicamerality of the script (case distinction).\n\nVarious typefaces have been designed to allow scribal abbreviations and other archaic glyphs to be replicated in print. They include \"record type\", which was first developed in the 1770s to publish Domesday Book and was fairly widely used for the publication of medieval records in Britain until the end of the 19th century.\n\nIn the Unicode Standard v. 5.1 (4 April 2008), 152 medieval and classical glyphs were given specific locations outside of the Private Use Area. Specifically, they are located in the charts \"Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement\" (26 characters), \"Latin Extended Additional\" (10 characters), \"Supplemental Punctuation\" (15 characters), \"Ancient Symbols\" (12 characters) and especially \"Latin Extended-D\" (89 characters).\nThese consist in both precomposed characters and modifiers for other characters, called combining diacritical marks (such as writing in LaTeX or using overstrike in MS Word).\n\nCharacters are \"the smallest components of written language that have semantic value\" but glyphs are \"the shapes that characters can have when they are rendered or displayed\".\n\n\n\n"}

He is the brother of actor Alleppey Vincent.\nSebastian was born on 9 February 1901 to Pollayil Vincent and Margarita as their second child in Ambalappuzha taluk of Alappuzha district in the Indian state of Kerala. His brother Alleppey Vincent is also a well known person in Malayalam industry who acted in the first talkie ever made in Malayalam, Balan. After initial schooling in his native village, he attended the Leo XIII School in Alappuzha. He later enrolled at St. Albert's High School in Ernakulam. It was at St. Albert's that he joined a Tamil drama troupe and toured several parts of Tamil Nadu before returning to Ernakulam. During his stay in Ernakulam, Kunjukunju was busy with drama and music and paid little attention to his studies. He returned to his home village to look after his ailing father. In 1923, Kunjukunju married Marykutty. She gave her support to his later theatrical ventures.\n\nKunjukunju's first lead role was in \"Njanasundari\", a Tamil drama translated into Malayalam which told the story of Prince Plendran and Princess Njanasundari. For next few years after Njanasundari, he could not get any major role in dramas. In 1929, \"Royal Cinema & Dramatic Company\" staged the drama \"Parudeesa Nashtam\" which was based on John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost. Kunjukunju played the role of Adam, while Ochira Velukkutty, an actor who is said to have enacted female roles better than real women, played the Eve. This is followed by, \"Satyavansavitri\", \"Alliarjuna\", \"Kovalan Charitram\", \"Nallathanka\", and \"Harishchandra\". The Kunjukunju–Velukkutty duo was the main attraction of all these dramas as they drew huge crowds.\n\n\n\n"}

Examples of social networking systems include Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nSemiotics is a discipline that studies images, symbols, signs and other similarly related objects in an effort to understand their use and meaning. Semiotic structuralism seeks the meaning of these objects within a social context. Post-structuralist theories take tools from structuralist semiotics in combination with social interaction, creating social semiotics. Social semiotics is “a branch of the field of semiotics which investigates human signifying practices in specific social and cultural circumstances and which tries to explain meaning-making as a social practice.” “Social semiotics also examines semiotic practices, specific to a culture and community, for the making of various kinds of texts and meanings in various situational contexts and contexts of culturally meaningful activity”. Social semiotics is concerned with studying human interactions.\n\nSocial networking is the communication among people within a virtual social space. This medium of communication allows insight into the significance of social semiotics. “Millions of people now interact through blogs, collaborate through wikis, play multiplayer games, publish podcasts and video, build relationships through social network sites and evaluate all the above forms of communication through feedback and ranking mechanisms”. Social semiotics “unlike speech, writing necessitates some sort of technology in the form of person device interaction”. Social semiotics functions through the triad of communication or Peircean semiotics in the form of sign, object, interpretant (Chart 1) and “Human, Machine, Tag (Information)” (Chart 2). In Peircean semiotics (Chart 1), \"A sign…[in the form of representamen] is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign, or perhaps a more developed sign. That sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the first sign. The sign stands for an object, not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea which I have something called the ground of the representamen\".\n\nThis example of the triangle of Human, Machine, Tag is shown when looking at tagging photographs on Facebook (Chart 3). The Human takes the photo on a camera and puts the digital file (information) on the Machine, the Machine is then navigated to Facebook where the file is downloaded. The Human has the Machine Tag the photo with information (e. g., names, places, data) for other Humans to see. This process then can be continued (see Chart 2). “Collaborative tagging has been quickly gaining ground because of its ability to recruit the activity of web users into effectively organizing and sharing large amounts of information”.\n"}
{"id": "3653058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3653058", "title": "Sign relation", "text": "Sign relation\n\nA sign relation is the basic construct in the theory of signs, also known as semiotics, as developed by Charles Sanders Peirce.\n\nThus, if a sunflower, in turning towards the sun, becomes by that very act fully capable, without further condition, of reproducing a sunflower which turns in precisely corresponding ways toward the sun, and of doing so with the same reproductive power, the sunflower would become a Representamen of the sun. (C.S. Peirce, \"Syllabus\" (\"c\". 1902), \"Collected Papers\", CP 2.274).\nIn his picturesque illustration of a sign relation, along with his tracing of a corresponding sign process, or \"semiosis\", Peirce uses the technical term \"representamen\" for his concept of a sign, but the shorter word is precise enough, so long as one recognizes that its meaning in a particular theory of signs is given by a specific definition of what it means to be a sign.\n\nOne of Peirce's clearest and most complete definitions of a sign is one that he gives, not incidentally, in the context of defining \"logic\", and so it is informative to view it in that setting.\nLogic will here be defined as \"formal semiotic\". A definition of a sign will be given which no more refers to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place which a particle occupies, part by part, during a lapse of time. Namely, a sign is something, \"A\", which brings something, \"B\", its \"interpretant\" sign determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence with something, \"C\", its \"object\", as that in which itself stands to \"C\". It is from this definition, together with a definition of \"formal\", that I deduce mathematically the principles of logic. I also make a historical review of all the definitions and conceptions of logic, and show, not merely that my definition is no novelty, but that my non-psychological conception of logic has \"virtually\" been quite generally held, though not generally recognized. (C.S. Peirce, NEM 4, 20–21).\nIn the general discussion of diverse theories of signs, the question frequently arises whether signhood is an absolute, essential, indelible, or \"ontological\" property of a thing, or whether it is a relational, interpretive, and mutable role that a thing can be said to have only within a particular context of relationships.\n\nPeirce's definition of a \"sign\" defines it in relation to its \"object\" and its \"interpretant sign\", and thus it defines signhood in \"relative terms\", by means of a predicate with three places. In this definition, signhood is a role in a triadic relation, a role that a thing bears or plays in a given context of relationships — it is not as an \"absolute\", \"non-relative\" property of a thing-in-itself, one that it possesses independently of all relationships to other things.\n\nSome of the terms that Peirce uses in his definition of a sign may need to be elaborated for the contemporary reader.\n\n\nThere is a close relationship between the pragmatic theory of signs and the pragmatic theory of inquiry. In fact, the correspondence between the two studies exhibits so many congruences and parallels that it is often best to treat them as integral parts of one and the same subject. In a very real sense, inquiry is the process by which sign relations come to be established and continue to evolve. In other words, inquiry, \"thinking\" in its best sense, \"is a term denoting the various ways in which things acquire significance\" (John Dewey). Thus, there is an active and intricate form of cooperation that needs to be appreciated and maintained between these converging modes of investigation. Its proper character is best understood by realizing that the theory of inquiry is adapted to study the developmental aspects of sign relations, a subject which the theory of signs is specialized to treat from structural and comparative points of view.\n\nBecause the examples to follow have been artificially constructed to be as simple as possible, their detailed elaboration can run the risk of trivializing the whole theory of sign relations. Despite their simplicity, however, these examples have subtleties of their own, and their careful treatment will serve to illustrate many important issues in the general theory of signs.\n\nImagine a discussion between two people, Ann and Bob, and attend only to that aspect of their interpretive practice that involves the use of the following nouns and pronouns: \"Ann\", \"Bob\", \"I\", \"you\".\n\nThe \"object domain\" of this discussion fragment is the set of two people {Ann, Bob}. The \"syntactic domain\" or the \"sign system\" that is involved in their discussion is limited to the \"set\" of four signs {\"Ann\", \"Bob\", \"I\", \"You\"}.\n\nIn their discussion, Ann and Bob are not only the passive objects of nominative and accusative references but also the active interpreters of the language that they use. The \"system of interpretation\" (SOI) associated with each language user can be represented in the form of an individual \"three-place relation\" called the \"sign relation\" of that interpreter.\n\nUnderstood in terms of its \"set-theoretic extension\", a sign relation L is a \"subset\" of a \"cartesian product\" O × S × I. Here, O, S, I are three sets that are known as the \"object domain\", the \"sign domain\", and the \"interpretant domain\", respectively, of the sign relation L ⊆ O × S × I.\n\nBroadly speaking, the three domains of a sign relation can be any sets whatsoever, but the kinds of sign relations that are typically contemplated in a computational setting are usually constrained to having I ⊆ S. In this case, interpretants are just a special variety of signs, and this makes it convenient to lump signs and interpretants together into a single class called the \"syntactic domain\". In the forthcoming examples, S and I are identical as sets, so the same elements manifest themselves in two different roles of the sign relations in question. When it is necessary to refer to the whole set of objects and signs in the union of the domains O, S, I for a given sign relation L, one may refer to this set as the \"world of L\" and write W = W = O ∪ S ∪ I.\n\nTo facilitate an interest in the abstract structures of sign relations, and to keep the notations as brief as possible as the examples become more complicated, it serves to introduce the following general notations:\n\nIntroducing a few abbreviations for use in considering the present Example, we have the following data:\n\nIn the present Example, S = I = Syntactic Domain.\n\nThe next two Tables give the sign relations associated with the interpreters A and B, respectively, putting them in the form of \"relational databases\". Thus, the rows of each Table list the ordered triples of the form (\"o\", \"s\", \"i\") that make up the corresponding sign relations, L and L ⊆ O × S × I. It is often tempting to use the same names for objects and for relations involving these objects, but it is best to avoid this in a first approach, taking up the issues that this practice raises after the less problematic features of these relations have been treated.\n\nThese Tables codify a rudimentary level of interpretive practice for the agents A and B, and provide a basis for formalizing the initial semantics that is appropriate to their common syntactic domain. Each row of a Table names an object and two co-referent signs, making up an ordered triple of the form (\"o\", \"s\", \"i\") that is called an \"elementary relation\", that is, one element of the relation's set-theoretic extension.\n\nAlready in this elementary context, there are several different meanings that might attach to the project of a \"formal semiotics\", or a formal theory of meaning for signs. In the process of discussing these alternatives, it is useful to introduce a few terms that are occasionally used in the philosophy of language to point out the needed distinctions.\n\nFor an arbitrary triadic relation L ⊆ O × S × I, whether it is a sign relation or not, there are six \"dyadic relations\" that can be obtained by \"projecting\" L on one of the planes of the OSI-space O × S × I. The six dyadic projections of a triadic relation L are defined and notated as follows:\n\nBy way of unpacking the set-theoretic notation, here is what the first definition says in ordinary language. The dyadic relation that results from the projection of L on the OS-plane O × S is written briefly as L or written more fully as \"proj\"(L), and it is defined as the set of all ordered pairs (\"o\", \"s\") in the cartesian product O × S for which there exists an ordered triple (\"o\", \"s\", \"i\") in L for some interpretant \"i\" in the interpretant domain I.\n\nIn the case where L is a sign relation, which it becomes by satisfying one of the definitions of a sign relation, some of the dyadic aspects of L can be recognized as formalizing aspects of sign meaning that have received their share of attention from students of signs over the centuries, and thus they can be associated with traditional concepts and terminology. Of course, traditions may vary as to the precise formation and usage of such concepts and terms. Other aspects of meaning have not received their fair share of attention, and thus remain anonymous on the contemporary scene of sign studies.\n\nOne aspect of a sign's complete meaning is concerned with the reference that a sign has to its objects, which objects are collectively known as the \"denotation\" of the sign. In the pragmatic theory of sign relations, denotative references fall within the projection of the sign relation on the plane that is spanned by its object domain and its sign domain.\n\nThe dyadic relation that makes up the \"denotative\", \"referential\", or \"semantic\" aspect or component of a sign relation L is notated as \"Den\"(L). Information about the denotative aspect of meaning is obtained from L by taking its projection on the object-sign plane, in other words, on the 2-dimensional space that is generated by the object domain O and the sign domain S. This semantic component of a sign relation L is written in any one of the forms, L, \"proj\"L, L, \"proj\"L, and it is defined as follows:\n\nLooking to the denotative aspects of L and L, various rows of the Tables specify, for example, that A uses \"i\" to denote A and \"u\" to denote B, whereas B uses \"i\" to denote B and \"u\" to denote A. All of these denotative references are summed up in the projections on the OS-plane, as shown in the following Tables:\n\nAnother aspect of meaning concerns the connection that a sign has to its interpretants within a given sign relation. As before, this type of connection can be vacuous, singular, or plural in its collection of terminal points, and it can be formalized as the dyadic relation that is obtained as a planar projection of the triadic sign relation in question.\n\nThe connection that a sign makes to an interpretant is here referred to as its \"connotation\". In the full theory of sign relations, this aspect of meaning includes the links that a sign has to affects, concepts, ideas, impressions, intentions, and the whole realm of an agent's mental states and allied activities, broadly encompassing intellectual associations, emotional impressions, motivational impulses, and real conduct. Taken at the full, in the natural setting of semiotic phenomena, this complex system of references is unlikely ever to find itself mapped in much detail, much less completely formalized, but the tangible warp of its accumulated mass is commonly alluded to as the connotative import of language.\n\nFormally speaking, however, the connotative aspect of meaning presents no additional difficulty. For a given sign relation L, the dyadic relation that constitutes the \"connotative aspect\" or \"connotative component\" of L is notated as \"Con\"(L).\n\nThe connotative aspect of a sign relation L is given by its projection on the plane of signs and interpretants, and is thus defined as follows:\n\nAll of these connotative references are summed up in the projections on the SI-plane, as shown in the following Tables:\n\nThe aspect of a sign's meaning that arises from the dyadic relation of its objects to its interpretants has no standard name. If an interpretant is considered to be a sign in its own right, then its independent reference to an object can be taken as belonging to another moment of denotation, but this neglects the mediational character of the whole transaction in which this occurs. Denotation and connotation have to do with dyadic relations in which the sign plays an active role, but here we have to consider a dyadic relation between objects and interpretants that is mediated by the sign from an off-stage position, as it were. As a relation between objects and interpretants that is mediated by a sign, this aspect of meaning may be referred to as the \"ennotation\" of a sign, and the dyadic relation that constitutes the \"ennotative aspect\" of a sign relation L may be notated as \"Enn\"(L).\n\nThe ennotational component of meaning for a sign relation L is captured by its projection on the plane of the object and interpretant domains, and it is thus defined as follows:\n\nAs it happens, the sign relations L and L are fully symmetric with respect to exchanging signs and interpretants, so all of the data of \"proj\"L is echoed unchanged in \"proj\"L\nand all of the data of \"proj\"L is echoed unchanged in \"proj\"L.\n\nIn the context of 3-adic relations in general, Peirce provides the following illustration of the six \"converses\" of a 3-adic relation, that is, the six differently ordered ways of stating what is logically the same 3-adic relation:\n\nWords spoken are symbols or signs (σύμβολα) of affections or impressions (παθήματα) of the soul (ψυχή); written words are the signs of words spoken. As writing, so also is speech not the same for all races of men. But the mental affections themselves, of which these words are primarily signs (), are the same for the whole of mankind, as are also the objects (πράγματα) of which those affections are representations or likenesses, images, copies (). (Aristotle, \"De Interpretatione\", 1.164).\nLogic will here be defined as \"formal semiotic\". A definition of a sign will be given which no more refers to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place which a particle occupies, part by part, during a lapse of time. Namely, a sign is something, \"A\", which brings something, \"B\", its \"interpretant\" sign determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence with something, \"C\", its \"object\", as that in which itself stands to \"C\". It is from this definition, together with a definition of \"formal\", that I deduce mathematically the principles of logic. I also make a historical review of all the definitions and conceptions of logic, and show, not merely that my definition is no novelty, but that my non-psychological conception of logic has \"virtually\" been quite generally held, though not generally recognized. (C.S. Peirce, \"Application to the Carnegie Institution\", L75 (1902), NEM 4, 20-21).\nA \"Sign\" is anything which is related to a Second thing, its \"Object\", in respect to a Quality, in such a way as to bring a Third thing, its \"Interpretant\", into relation to the same Object, and that in such a way as to bring a Fourth into relation to that Object in the same form, \"ad infinitum\".

{"id": "261949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261949", "title": "Simplified Chinese characters", "text": "Simplified Chinese characters\n\nSimplified Chinese characters () are standardized Chinese characters prescribed in the \"Table of General Standard Chinese Characters\" for use in mainland China. Along with traditional Chinese characters, they are one of the two standard character sets of the contemporary Chinese written language. The government of the People's Republic of China in mainland China has promoted them for use in printing since the 1950s and 1960s to encourage literacy. They are officially used in the People's Republic of China and Singapore.\n\nTraditional Chinese characters are currently used in Hong Kong, Macau, and the Republic of China (Taiwan). While traditional characters can still be read and understood by many mainland Chinese and the Chinese community in Malaysia and Singapore, these groups generally retain their use of Simplified characters. Overseas Chinese communities generally tend to use traditional characters.\n\nSimplified Chinese characters may be referred to by their official name above or colloquially (). The latter refers to simplifications of character \"structure\" or \"body\", character forms that have existed for thousands of years alongside regular, more complicated forms. On the other hand, the official name refers to the modern systematically simplified character set, which (as stated by then-Chairman Mao Zedong in 1952) includes not only structural simplification but also substantial reduction in the total number of standardized Chinese characters.\n\nSimplified character forms were created by reducing the number of strokes and simplifying the forms of a sizable proportion of Chinese characters. Some simplifications were based on popular cursive forms embodying graphic or phonetic simplifications of the traditional forms. Some characters were simplified by applying regular rules, for example, by replacing all occurrences of a certain component with a simplified version of the component. Variant characters with the same pronunciation and identical meaning were reduced to a single standardized character, usually the simplest amongst all variants in form. Finally, many characters were left untouched by simplification, and are thus identical between the traditional and simplified Chinese orthographies.\n\nSome simplified characters are very dissimilar to and unpredictably different from traditional characters, especially in those where a component is replaced by a simple symbol. This often leads opponents not well-versed in the method of simplification to conclude that the 'overall process' of character simplification is arbitrary. In reality, the methods and rules of simplification are few and internally consistent. On the other hand, proponents of simplification often flaunt a few choice simplified characters as ingenious inventions, when in fact these have existed for hundreds of years as ancient variants.\n\nA second round of simplifications was promulgated in 1977, but was later retracted in 1986 for a variety of reasons, largely due to the confusion caused and the unpopularity of the second round simplifications. However, the Chinese government never officially dropped its goal of further simplification in the future.\n\nIn August 2009, the PRC began collecting public comments for a modified list of simplified characters. The new \"Table of General Standard Chinese Characters\" consisting of 8,105 (simplified and unchanged) characters was officially implemented for use by the State Council of the People's Republic of China on June 5, 2013.\n\nAlthough most of the simplified Chinese characters in use today are the result of the works moderated by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the 1950s and 60s, character simplification predates the PRC's formation in 1949. Cursive written text almost always includes character simplification. Simplified forms used in print are attested as early as the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC).\nOne of the earliest proponents of character simplification was Lubi Kui, who proposed in 1909 that simplified characters should be used in education. In the years following the May Fourth Movement in 1919, many anti-imperialist Chinese intellectuals sought ways to modernise China. Traditional culture and values such as Confucianism were challenged. Soon, people in the Movement started to cite the traditional Chinese writing system as an obstacle in modernising China and therefore proposed that a reform be initiated. It was suggested that the Chinese writing system should be either simplified or completely abolished. Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese author in the 20th century, stated that, \"If Chinese characters are not destroyed, then China will die.\" () Recent commentators have claimed that Chinese characters were blamed for the economic problems in China during that time.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, discussions on character simplification took place within the Kuomintang government, and a large number of Chinese intellectuals and writers maintained that character simplification would help boost literacy in China. In 1935, 324 simplified characters collected by Qian Xuantong were officially introduced as the table of first batch of simplified characters, but they were suspended in 1936.\n\nThe PRC issued its first round of official character simplifications in two documents, the first in 1956 and the second in 1964.\n\nWithin the PRC, further character simplification became associated with the leftists of the Cultural Revolution, culminating with the second-round simplified characters, which were promulgated in 1977. In part due to the shock and unease felt in the wake of the Cultural Revolution and Mao's death, the second-round of simplifications was poorly received. In 1986 the authorities retracted the second round completely. Later in the same year, the authorities promulgated a final list of simplifications, which is identical to the 1964 list except for six changes (including the restoration of three characters that had been simplified in the First Round: , , ; note that the form is used instead of in regions using Traditional Chinese).\n\nThere had been simplification initiatives aimed at eradicating characters entirely and establishing the Hanyu Pinyin romanization as the official written system of the PRC, but the reform never gained quite as much popularity as the leftists had hoped. After the retraction of the second round of simplification, the PRC stated that it wished to keep Chinese orthography stable. Years later in 2009, the Chinese government released a major revision list which included 8,300 characters. No new simplifications were introduced. However, six characters previously listed as \"traditional\" characters that have been simplified, as well as 51 other \"variant\" characters, were restored to the standard list. In addition, orthographies (e.g., stroke shape) for 44 characters were proposed to be modified slightly to fit traditional calligraphic rules. Also, the practice of unrestricted simplification of rare and archaic characters by analogy using simplified radicals or components is now discouraged. A State Language Commission official cited \"oversimplification\" as the reason for restoring some characters. The language authority declared an open comment period until August 31, 2009 for feedback from the public. The proposed orthographic changes to 44 characters were not implemented due to overwhelmingly negative public opinion.\n\nThe officially promulgated version of the \"List of Commonly Used Standardized Characters\", announced in 2013, contained 45 newly recognized standard characters that were previously considered variant forms, as well as official approval of 226 characters that had been simplified by analogy and had seen wide use but were not explicitly given in previous lists or documents.\n\nSingapore underwent three successive rounds of character simplification, eventually arriving at the same set of simplified characters as Mainland China.\n\nThe first round, consisting of 498 Simplified characters from 502 Traditional characters, was promulgated by the Ministry of Education in 1969. The second round, consisting of 2287 Simplified characters, was promulgated in 1974. The second set contained 49 differences from the Mainland China system; those were removed in the final round in 1976. In 1993, Singapore adopted the six revisions made by Mainland China in 1986. However, unlike in mainland China where personal names may only be registered using simplified characters, parents have the option of registering their children's names in traditional characters in Singapore.\n\nMalaysia promulgated a set of simplified characters in 1981, which were also completely identical to the simplified characters used in Mainland China. Chinese-language schools use these.\n\nTraditional characters are still often seen in decorative contexts such as shop signs and calligraphy in both countries.\n\nA small group called Dou Zi Sei ()/Dou Zi Wui () attempted to introduce a special version of simplified characters using romanizations in the 1930s. Today, however, the traditional characters remain dominant in Hong Kong.\n\nAfter World War II, Japan also simplified a number of Chinese characters (\"kanji\") used in the Japanese language. The new forms are called \"shinjitai\". Compared to Chinese, the Japanese reform was more limited, simplifying only a few hundred characters, most of which were already in use in cursive script. Further, the list of simplifications was exhaustive, unlike Chinese simplification – thus analogous simplifications of not explicitly simplified characters (\"extended shinjitai\") are not approved, and instead standard practice is to use the traditional forms.\n\nThe number of characters in circulation was also reduced, and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established. The overall effect was to standardize teaching and the use of Kanji in modern literature and media.\n\n\nAll characters simplified this way are enumerated in Chart 1 and Chart 2 in the Complete List of Simplified Characters. Characters in both charts are structurally simplified based on similar set of principles. They are separated into two charts to clearly mark those in Chart 2 as 'usable as simplified character components', based on which Chart 3 is derived.\n\nReplacing a character with another existing character that sounds the same or similar:\n\nUsing printed forms of cursive shapes ():\n\nReplacing a component of a character with a simple symbol such as and :\n\nOmitting entire components:\n\nFurther morphing a character after omitting some components:\n\nPreserving the basic outline or shape of the original character\n\nReplacing the phonetic component of phono-semantic compound characters:\n\nReplacing some arbitrary part of a character with a phonetic component, turning it into a new phono-semantic compound character:\n\nReplacing entire character with a newly coined phono-semantic compound character:\n\nRemoving radicals from characters\n\nOnly retaining radicals from characters\n\nAdopting obscure ancient forms or variants:\n\nAdopting ancient vulgar variants:\n\nRe-adopting abandoned phonetic-loan characters:\n\nModifying a traditional character to simplify another traditional character:\n\nBased on 132 characters and 14 components listed in Chart 2 of the Complete List of Simplified Characters, the 1,753 'derived' characters found in the non-exhaustive Chart 3 can be created by systematically simplifying components using Chart 2 as a conversion table. While exercising such derivation, following rules should be observed:\n\n\nSample Derivations:\n\nThe \"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\" reduces the number of total standard characters. First, amongst each set of variant characters sharing identical pronunciation and meaning, one character (usually the simplest in form) is elevated to the standard character set, and the rest are obsoleted. Then amongst the chosen variants, those that appear in the \"Complete List of Simplified Characters\" are also simplified in character structure accordingly. Some examples follow:\n\nSample reduction of equivalent variants:\n\nIn choosing standard characters, often ancient variants with simple structures are preferred:\n\nVulgar forms simpler in structure are also chosen:\n\nThe chosen variant was already simplified in Chart 1:\n\nIn some instance, the chosen variant is actually more complex than eliminated ones. This is often taken up by opponents of simplification who are not aware of the dual goals of simplification (i.e. in structure of characters as well as in total number of characters) to decry that simplification does not always simplify characters. An example is the character which is eliminated in favor of the variant form . Note that the \"hand\" radical , with three strokes, on the left of the eliminated is now \"seen\" as more complex, appearing as the \"tree\" radical , with four strokes, in the chosen variant .\n\nThe new standardized character forms started in the \"List of character forms of General Used Chinese characters for Publishing\" and revised through the \"List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese\" tend to adopt vulgar variant character forms. Since the new forms take vulgar variants, many characters now appear slightly simpler compared to old forms, and as such are often mistaken as structurally simplified characters. Some examples follow:\n\nThe traditional component becomes :\n\nThe traditional component becomes :\n\nThe traditional \"Break\" stroke becomes the \"Dot\" stroke:\n\nThe traditional components and become :\n\nThe traditional component becomes :\n\nThe traditional component becomes :\n\nIt is a common misconception that the simplification process is arbitrary and not based on consistent rules. These allegations are often made when people 'discover' their own 'principles of simplification' from anecdotal evidence. Note, however, that simplification by derivation must follow the rules mentioned earlier.\n\nAn often cited example of the apparent irregularity of simplification involves characters that appear to share the simple symbol used in many simplified characters in Chart 1. Often it is intuited that is a 'character component', after observing → , → , → , etc. A student of simplification may infer that the same simplification mechanism also works for → and → . When observing that → , → , → , (not simplified) and (not simplified), one may come to the conclusion that the process of simplification is irregular.\n\nHowever, in the Complete List of Simplified Characters, → appears in Chart 1. → is listed in Chart 2. And → is a derived character found in the non-exhaustive list in Chart 3. Therefore, is defined as a 'simplified character component' according to the standard, while is not. Based on , is simplified to , and to .\n\nIn the \"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\", the variant character is replaced by . The character is simplified in Chart 1 to . Therefore, → .\n\nBoth → and → appear in Chart 1. Thus they are not defined as derived characters.\n\nThere are no characters or components found in Chart 2 usable for derivation of and . Further investigation reveals that these two characters do not appear in Chart 1 nor in \"Series One Organization List of Variant Characters\". Thus they are not defined as simplified characters; they remain unchanged from traditional forms in the \"List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese\".\n\nNot all new character forms result in simpler characters (i.e. fewer strokes). For instance, the old form , with 11 strokes, now appears as , with 12 strokes, in the new form. However, technically, these new character forms do not constitute simplified characters.\n\nStrangely, some characters with the water radical with three dots 氵 in the traditional form were simplified into the ice radical with two dots 冫 in the simplified form. Some examples are → , → , and → .\n\nThe People's Republic of China, Singapore and Malaysia generally use simplified characters. They appear very sparingly in printed text produced in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities, although they are becoming more prevalent as China opens to the world. Conversely, the mainland is seeing an increase in the use of traditional forms, where they are often used on signs, and in logos, blogs, dictionaries, and scholarly works.\n\nThe Law of the People's Republic of China on the National Common Language and Characters implies simplified Chinese as the standard script, with Traditional Chinese being used for purposes such as ceremonies, cultural purposes (e.g. calligraphy), decoration, publications and books on ancient literature and poetry, and research purposes. Traditional Chinese remains ubiquitous on buildings predating the promotion of simplified characters, such as former government buildings, religious buildings, educational institutions, and historical monuments. Traditional Chinese is also often used for commercial purposes, such as shopfront displays and advertisements.\n\nAs part of the one country, two systems model, the PRC has not attempted to force Hong Kong or Macau into using simplified characters. The PRC tends to print material intended for people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese in Traditional characters. For example, it prints versions of the \"People's Daily\" in Traditional characters and both the \"People's Daily\" and Xinhua websites have versions in Traditional characters using Big5 encoding. Mainland companies selling products in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan use Traditional characters on their displays and packaging to communicate with consumers (the reverse is true as well).\n\nDictionaries published in mainland China generally show both simplified and their Traditional counterparts. In digital media, many cultural phenomena imported from Hong Kong and Taiwan into mainland China, such as music videos, karaoke videos, subtitled movies, and subtitled dramas, use Traditional Chinese characters.\n\nTextbooks, official statements, newspapers, including the PRC-funded media, show no signs of moving to simplified Chinese characters. However, some students may opt to use the simplified form when taking notes or doing test papers to write faster.\n\nIt is common for Hong Kong people to learn traditional Chinese characters in school, and some simplified Chinese in passing (either through reading mainland-published books or other media). For use on computers, however, people tend to type Chinese characters using a traditional character set such as Big5. In Hong Kong, as well as elsewhere, it is common for people who use both sets to do so because it is much easier to convert from the traditional character set to the simplified character set because of the usage of the aforementioned methods 8 and 9 of simplification.\n\nSimplified Chinese characters are not officially used in governmental and civil publications in Taiwan. However, it is legal to import simplified character publications and distribute them. Certain simplified characters that have long existed in informal writing for centuries also have popular usage, while those characters simplified originally by the Taiwanese government are much less common in daily appearance.\n\nIn all areas, most handwritten text will include informal simplifications (alternative script) which are not the same as the simplifications officially promulgated by the PRC and are often instead influenced by the \"shinjitai\" used in Japan. The informal simplification of the first character of \"Taiwan\" from to rivals its orthodox form in commonality, even in print and in answers to school exams.\n\nIn Singapore, where Chinese is one of the official languages, simplified characters are the official standard and used in all official publications as well as government-controlled press. While simplified characters are taught exclusively in schools, the government does not officially discourage the use of traditional characters. While all official publications are in simplified characters, the government still allows parents to choose whether to have their child's Chinese name registered in simplified or traditional characters.\n\nIn Malaysia, Chinese is not an official language, but over 90% of ethnic-Chinese students are educated in Chinese schools, which have taught simplified characters since 1981. However, traditional characters are widely used by older generations, and are widespread on signboards, etc. Most of Malaysia's Chinese newspapers compromise by retaining traditional characters in article headlines, but using simplified characters for content.\n\nAs there is no restriction of the use of traditional characters in the mass media, television programmes, books, magazines and music CD's that have been imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan are widely available, and these almost always use traditional characters. Most karaoke discs, being imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan, have song lyrics in traditional characters as well. Many shop signs continue to be written in traditional characters. Menus in hawker centres and coffeeshops are also commonly seen in traditional characters.\n\nIn general, schools in Mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore use simplified characters exclusively, while schools in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan use traditional characters exclusively.\n\nToday, simplified Chinese characters predominate among college and university programs teaching Chinese as a foreign language outside of China, such as those in the United States.\n\nIn December 2004, Ministry of education authorities rejected a proposal from a Beijing CPPCC political conference member that called for elementary schools to teach traditional Chinese characters in addition to the simplified ones. The conference member pointed out that most mainland Chinese, especially young people, have difficulties with traditional Chinese characters; this is especially important in dealing with non-mainland communities such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. The educational authorities did not approve the recommendation, saying that it did not fit in with the \"requirements as set out by the law\" and it could potentially complicate the curricula. A similar proposal was delivered to the 1st Plenary Session of the 11th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in March 2008.\n\nMost, if not all, Chinese language text books in Hong Kong are written in traditional characters. Before 1997, the use of simplified characters was generally discouraged by educators. After 1997, while students are still expected to be proficient and utilize traditional characters in formal settings, they may sometimes adopt a hybrid written form in informal settings to speed up writing. With the exception of open examinations, Simplified Chinese characters are considered acceptable by the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority for their speed.\n\nChinese textbooks in Singapore and Malaysia are written exclusively in simplified characters, and only simplified characters are taught in school. Traditional characters are usually only taught to those taking up calligraphy as a co-curricular activity or Cantonese as an elective course at school.\n\nAs the source of many Mandarin Chinese textbooks is mainland China, the majority of textbooks teaching Chinese are now based on simplified characters and Hanyu Pinyin – although there are textbooks originating in China which have a traditional version. For practical reasons, universities and schools prepare students who will be able to communicate with mainland China, so their obvious choice is to use simplified characters.\n\nIn places where a particular set is not locally entrenched, e.g., Europe and the United States, instruction is now mostly simplified, as the economic importance of mainland China increases, and also because of the availability of textbooks printed in mainland China. Teachers of international students often recommend learning both systems.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, universities mainly teach Mandarin Chinese at the undergraduate level using the simplified characters coupled with pinyin. However, they will require the students to learn or be able to recognise the traditional forms if they are studying in Taiwan or Hong Kong (such as taking Cantonese courses). In Australia and New Zealand, schools, universities and TAFEs use predominantly simplified characters.\n\nRussia and most East European nations are traditionally oriented on the education of the PRC's system for teaching Chinese, which uses simplified characters but exposes the learners to both systems.\n\nIn South Korea, universities have used predominantly simplified characters since 1990s. In high school, Chinese is one of the selective subjects. By the regulation of the national curricula standards, MPS I and traditional characters had been originally used before (since the 1940s), but by the change of regulation, pinyin and simplified characters have been used to pupils who enter the school in 1996 or later. Therefore, MPS I and traditional characters disappeared after 1998 in South Korean high school Chinese curriculum.\n\nIn Japan there are two types of schools. Simplified Chinese is taught instead of traditional Chinese in pro-mainland China schools. They also teach Pinyin, a romanization system for standard Chinese, while the Taiwan-oriented schools teach Zhuyin, which uses phonetic symbols. However, the Taiwan-oriented schools are starting to teach simplified Chinese and Pinyin to offer a more well-rounded education.\n\nIn the Philippines, the use of simplified characters is getting more and more popular. Before the 1970s, Chinese schools in the Philippines were under the supervision of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China. Hence, most books were using the Traditional Characters. Traditional Characters remained prevalent until the early 2000s. However, institutions like the Confucius Institute, being the cultural arm of the People's Republic of China, are strong proponents of the use of Simplified Characters. Also, many new schools are now importing their Mandarin textbooks from Singapore instead of Taiwan.\n\nPublic universities such as the Linguistics and Asian Languages Department of the University of the Philippines use Simplified Characters in their teaching materials. On the other hand, private schools such as Chiang Kai Shek College and Saint Jude Catholic School remain major proponents of the usage of Traditional Characters. However, some private universities, such as the Ateneo de Manila University, now use Simplified Characters.\n\nIn computer text applications, the GB encoding scheme most often renders simplified Chinese characters, while Big5 most often renders traditional characters. Although neither encoding has an explicit connection with a specific character set, the lack of a one-to-one mapping between the simplified and traditional sets established a de facto linkage.\n\nSince simplified Chinese conflated many characters into one and since the initial version of the GB encoding scheme, known as GB2312-80, contained only one code point for each character, it is impossible to use GB2312 to map to the bigger set of traditional characters. It is theoretically possible to use Big5 code to map to the smaller set of simplified character glyphs, although there is little market for such a product. Newer and alternative forms of GB have support for traditional characters. In particular, mainland authorities have now established GB 18030 as the official encoding standard for use in all mainland software publications. The encoding contains all East Asian characters included in Unicode 3.0. As such, GB 18030 encoding contains both simplified and traditional characters found in Big-5 and GB, as well as all characters found in Japanese and Korean encodings.\n\nUnicode deals with the issue of simplified and traditional characters as part of the project of Han unification by including code points for each. This was rendered necessary by the fact that the linkage between simplified characters and traditional characters is not one-to-one. While this means that a Unicode system can display both simplified and traditional characters, it also means that different localization files are needed for each type.\n\nThe Chinese characters used in modern Japanese (called Kanji characters) have also undergone simplification, but generally to a lesser extent than with simplified Chinese. It is worth mentioning that Japan's writing system utilizes a reduced number of Chinese characters in daily use, resulting partly from the Japanese language reforms; thus, a number of complex characters are written phonetically. Reconciling these different character sets in Unicode became part of the controversial process of Han unification. Not surprisingly, some of the Chinese characters used in Japan are neither 'traditional' nor 'simplified'. In this case, these characters cannot be found in traditional/simplified Chinese dictionaries.\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium's Internationalization working group recommends the use of the language tag zh-Hans as a language attribute value and Content-Language value to specify web-page content in simplified Chinese characters.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45425", "title": "Smart growth", "text": "Smart growth\n\nSmart growth is an urban planning and transportation theory that concentrates growth in compact walkable urban centers to avoid sprawl. It also advocates compact, transit-oriented, walkable, bicycle-friendly land use, including neighborhood schools, complete streets, and mixed-use development with a range of housing choices. The term \"smart growth\" is particularly used in North America. In Europe and particularly the UK, the terms \"compact city\", \"urban densification\" or \"urban intensification\" have often been used to describe similar concepts, which have influenced government planning policies in the UK, the Netherlands and several other European countries.\n\nSmart growth values long-range, regional considerations of sustainability over a short-term focus. Its sustainable development goals are to achieve a unique sense of community and place; expand the range of transportation, employment, and housing choices; equitably distribute the costs and benefits of development; preserve and enhance natural and cultural resources; and promote public health.\n\nSmart Growth is a theory of land development that accepts that growth and development will continue to occur, and so seeks to direct that growth in an intentional, comprehensive way. Its proponents include urban planners, architects, developers, community activists, and historic preservationists. The term \"Smart Growth\" is an attempt to reframe the conversation from \"growth\" versus \"no growth\" (or NIMBY) to good/smart growth versus bad/dumb growth. Proponents seek to distinguish Smart Growth from urban sprawl which they claim causes most of the problems that fuel opposition to urban growth, such as traffic congestion and environmental degradation. Smart growth principles are directed at developing sustainable communities that provide a greater range of transportation and housing choices and prioritize infill and redevelopment in existing communities rather than development of \"greenfield\" farmland or natural lands. Some of the fundamental aims for the benefits of residents and the communities are increasing family income and wealth, providing safe walking routes to schools, fostering livable, safe and healthy places, stimulating economic activity (both locally and regionally), and developing, preserving and investing in built and natural resources.\nSmart growth \"principles\" describe the elements of community that are envisioned and smart growth \"regulations\" describe the various approaches to implementation, that is, how federal, state, and municipal governments choose to fulfill smart growth principles. Some of these regulatory approaches such as Urban Growth Boundaries predate the use of the term Smart Growth. One of the earliest efforts to establish smart growth forward as an explicit regulatory framework were put forth by the American Planning Association. In 1997, the APA introduced a project called Growing Smart and published \"Growing Smart Legislative Guidebook: Model Statutes for Planning and the Management of Change.\" The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines smart growth as “development that serves the economy, the community, and the environment. It changes the terms of the development debate away from the traditional growth/no growth question to how and where should new development be accommodated” \n\nSmart growth is related to, or may be used in combination with the following concepts:\n\nThe smart growth approach to development is multifaceted and can encompass a variety of techniques. For example, in the state of Massachusetts smart growth is enacted by a combination of techniques including increasing housing density along transit nodes, conserving farm land, and mixing residential and commercial use areas. Perhaps the most descriptive term to characterize this concept is Traditional Neighborhood Development, which recognizes that smart growth and related concepts are not necessarily new, but are a response to car culture and sprawl. Many favor the term New Urbanism, which invokes a new, but traditional way of looking at urban planning.\n\nThere are a range of best practices associated with smart growth, these include: supporting existing communities, redeveloping underutilized sites, enhancing economic competitiveness, providing more transportation choices, developing livability measures and tools, promoting equitable and affordable housing, providing a vision for sustainable growth, enhancing integrated planning and investment, aligning, coordinating, and leveraging government policies, redefining housing affordability and making the development process transparent.\n\nRelated, but somewhat different, are the overarching goals of smart growth, and they include: making the community more competitive for new businesses, providing alternative places to shop, work, and play, creating a better \"Sense of Place,\" providing jobs for residents, increasing property values, improving quality of life, expanding the tax base, preserving open space, controlling growth, and improving safety.\n\nThere are 10 accepted principles that define smart growth:\n\nTransportation and community planners began to promote the idea of compact cities and communities and adopt many of the regulatory approaches associated with Smart Growth in the early 1970s. The cost and difficulty of acquiring land (particularly in historic and/or areas designated as conservancies) to build and widen highways caused some politicians to reconsider basing transportation planning on motor vehicles.\n\nThe Congress for the New Urbanism, with architect Peter Calthorpe, promoted and popularized the idea of urban villages that relied on public transportation, bicycling, and walking instead of automobile use. Architect Andrés Duany promoted changing design codes to promote a sense of community, and to discourage driving. Colin Buchanan and Stephen Plowden helped to lead the debate in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Local Government Commission which presents the annual New Partners for Smart Growth conference adopted the original Ahwahnee Principles in 1991 which articulates many of the major principles now generally accepted as part of smart growth movement such as Transit oriented development, a focus on walking distance, greenbelts and wildlife corridors, and infill and redevelopment. The document was co-authored by several of the founders of the New Urbanist movement. The Local Government Commission has been co-sponsoring Smart Growth related conferences since 1997. The New Partners for Smart Growth Conference started under that name circa 2002.\n\nSmart Growth America, an organization devoted to the promoting Smart Growth in the United States, was founded in 2002. This organization leads an evolving coalition of national and regional organizations most of which predated its founding such as 1000 Friends of Oregon founded in 1975 and the Congress for the New Urbanism founded in 1993. The EPA launched its smart growth program in 1995.\n\nSmart growth is an alternative to urban sprawl, traffic congestion, disconnected neighborhoods, and urban decay. Its principles challenge old assumptions in urban planning, such as the value of detached houses and automobile use.\n\nEnvironmentalists promote smart growth by advocating urban-growth boundaries, or Green belts, as they have been termed in England since the 1930s.\n\nTransit-oriented development can improve the quality of life and encourage a healthier, pedestrian-based lifestyle with less pollution. The United States Environmental Protection Agency suggests Smart growth to reduce air pollution.\n\nSmart Growth advocates claim that much of the urban sprawl of the 20th Century was due to government subsidies for infrastructure that redistribute the true costs of sprawl. Examples include subsidies for highway building, fossil fuels, and electricity.\n\nWith electricity, there is a cost associated with extending and maintaining the service delivery system, as with water and sewage, but there also is a loss in the commodity being delivered. The farther from the generator, the more power is lost in distribution. According to the Department of Energy's (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA), 9 percent of energy is lost in transmission.\n\nCurrent average cost pricing, where customers pay the same price per unit of power regardless of the true cost of their service, subsidizes sprawl development. With electricity deregulation, some states now charge customers/developers fees for extending distribution to new locations rather than rolling such costs into utility rates.\n\nNew Jersey, for example, has implemented a plan that divides the state into five planning areas, some of which are designated for growth, while others are protected. The state is developing a series of incentives to coax local governments into changing zoning laws that will be compatible with the state plan. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities recently proposed a revised rule that presents a tiered approach to utility financing. In areas not designated for growth, utilities and their ratepayers are forbidden to cover the costs of extending utility lines to new developments—and developers will be required to pay the full cost of public utility infrastructure. In designated growth areas that have local smart plans endorsed by the State Planning Commission, developers will be refunded the cost of extending utility lines to new developments at two times the rate of the revenue received by developers in smart growth areas that do not have approved plans.\n\nGrowth is \"smart growth\", to the extent that it includes the elements listed below.\n\nCompact, livable urban neighborhoods attract more people and business. Creating such neighborhoods is a critical element of reducing urban sprawl and protecting the climate. Such a tactic includes adopting redevelopment strategies and zoning policies that channel housing and job growth into urban centers and neighborhood business districts, to create compact, walkable, and bike- and transit-friendly hubs. This sometimes requires local governmental bodies to implement code changes that allow increased height and density downtown and regulations that not only eliminate minimum parking requirements for new development but establish a maximum number of allowed spaces. Other topics fall under this concept:\n\nIn sustainable architecture the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s.\n\nTransit-oriented development (TOD) is a residential or commercial area designed to maximize access to public transport, and mixed-use/compact neighborhoods tend to use transit at all times of the day.\n\nBiking and walking instead of driving can reduce emissions, save money on fuel and maintenance, and foster a healthier population. Pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly improvements include bike lanes on main streets, an urban bike-trail system, bike parking, pedestrian crossings, and associated master plans. The most pedestrian- and bike-friendly variant of smart growth and New Urbanism is New Pedestrianism because motor vehicles are on a separate grid.\n\n\nThe most widely used tool for achieving smart growth is modification of local zoning laws. Zoning laws are applicable to most cities and counties in the United States. Smart Growth advocates often seek to modify zoning ordinances to increase the density of development and redevelopment allowed in or near existing towns and neighborhoods and/or restrict new development in outlying or environmentally sensitive areas. Additional density incentives can be offered for development of brownfield and greyfield land or for providing amenities such as parks and open space. Zoning ordinances typically include minimum parking requirements. Reductions in or elimination of parking minimums or imposition of parking maximums can also reduce the amount of parking built with new development increasing land available for parks and other community amenities.\n\nRelated to zoning ordinances, an Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) is a tool that used in some U.S. cities to contain high density development to certain areas. The first urban growth boundary in the United States was established in 1958 in Kentucky. Subsequently, urban growth boundaries were established in Oregon in the 1970s and Florida in 1980s. Some believe that UGBs contributed to the escalation of housing prices from 2000 to 2006, as they limited the supply of developable land. However, this is not completely substantiated because prices continued to rise even after municipalities expanded their growth boundaries.\n\nTransfer of development rights (TDR) systems are intended to allow property owners in areas deemed desirable for growth (such as infill and brownfield sites) to purchase the right to build at higher densities from owners of properties in areas deemed undesirable for growth such as environmental lands, farmlands or lands outside of an urban growth boundary. TDR programs have been implemented in over 200 U.S. communities.\n\nSystematic provision of infrastructure such as schools, libraries, sporting facilities and community facilities is an integral component of smart growth communities. This is commonly known as 'social infrastructure' or 'community infrastructure'. In Australia, for example, most new suburban developments are master planned, and key social infrastructure is planned at the outset.\n\nOne popular approach to assist in smart growth in democratic countries is for lawmakers to require prospective developers to prepare environmental impact assessments of their plans as a condition for state and/or local governments to give them permission to build their buildings. These reports often indicate how significant impacts generated by the development will be mitigated, the cost of which is usually paid by the developer. These assessments are frequently controversial. Conservationists, neighborhood advocacy groups and NIMBYs are often skeptical about such impact reports, even when they are prepared by independent agencies and subsequently approved by the decision makers rather than the promoters. Conversely, developers will sometimes strongly resist being required to implement the mitigation measures required by the local government as they may be quite costly.\n\nIn communities practicing these smart growth policies, developers comply with local codes and requirements. Consequently, developer compliance builds communal trust because it demonstrates a genuine interest in the environmental quality of the community.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency has recognized these cities for implementing smart growth principles:\n\nThe smart growth Network has recognized these U.S. cities for implementing smart growth principles:\n\nIn July 2011, \"The Atlantic\" magazine called the BeltLine, a series of housing, trail, and transit projects along a 22-mile (35-km) long disused rail corridor surrounding the core of Atlanta, the United States' \"most ambitious smart growth project\".\n\nIn Savannah, Georgia (US) the historic Oglethorpe Plan has been shown to contain most of the elements of smart growth in its network of wards, each of which has a central civic square. The plan has demonstrated its resilience to changing conditions, and the city is using the plan as a model for growth in newer areas.\n\nIn Melbourne, Australia, almost all new outer-suburban developments are master planned, guided by the principles of smart growth.\n\nWhether smart growth (or the 'Compact City') does or can reduce problems of automobile dependency associated with urban sprawl have been fiercely contested issues over several decades. A 2007 meta-study by Keith Barthomomew of the University of Utah found that reductions in driving associated with compact development scenarios averaged 8 percent ranging up to 31.7 percent with the variation being explained by degree of land use mixing and density. An influential study in 1989 by Peter Newman and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia. The study has been criticised for its methodology but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted — although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.\n\nWithin cities studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and ex-urban residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income. This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection: people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour. More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.\n\nReviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour Melia \"et al.\" (2011) found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of smart growth. Planning policies which increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.\n\nFor example, Portland, Oregon a U.S. city which has pursued smart growth policies, substantially increased its population density between 1990 and 2000 when other US cities of a similar size were reducing in density. As predicted by the paradox, traffic volumes and congestion both increased more rapidly than in the other cities, despite a substantial increase in transit use.\n\nThese findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states \"Ceteris paribus, urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs\".\n\nAt the citywide level it may be possible, through a range of positive measures to counteract the increases in traffic and congestion which would otherwise result from increasing population densities: Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany is one example of a city which has been more successful in this respect.\n\nThis study also reviewed evidence on the local effects of building at higher densities. At the level of the neighbourhood or individual development positive measures (e.g. improvements to public transport) will usually be insufficient to counteract the traffic effect of increasing population density. This leaves policy-makers with four choices: intensify and accept the local consequences, sprawl and accept the wider consequences, a compromise with some element of both, or intensify accompanied by more radical measures such as parking restrictions, closing roads to traffic and carfree zones.\n\nIn contrast the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts reported that its Kendall Square Neighborhood saw a 40% increase in commercial space attended by a traffic decrease of 14%.\n\nA report by CEOs for Cities report, \"Driven Apart,\" showed that while denser cities in the United States may have more congested commutes they are also shorter on average in both time and distance. This is in contrast to cities where commuters face less congestion but drive longer distances resulting in commutes that take as long or longer.\n\n\nRobert Bruegmann, professor of art history, architecture, and urban planning at the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of \"Sprawl: A Compact History\", stated that historical attempts to combat urban sprawl have failed, and that the high population density of Los Angeles, currently the most dense urban area in the United States, \"lies at the root of many of the woes experienced by L.A. today.\"\n\nWendell Cox is a vocal opponent of smart growth policies. He argued before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that, \"smart growth strategies tend to intensify the very problems they are purported to solve.\" Cox and Joshua Utt analyzed smart growth and sprawl, and argued that:\n\nOur analysis indicates that the Current Urban Planning Assumptions are of virtually no value in predicting local government expenditures per capita. The lowest local government expenditures per capita are not in the higher density, slower growing, and older municipalities.\n\nOn the contrary, the actual data indicate that the lowest expenditures per capita tend to be in medium- and lower-density municipalities (though not the lowest density); medium- and faster-growing municipalities; and newer municipalities. This is after 50 years of unprecedented urban decentralization, which seems to be more than enough time to have developed the purported urban sprawl-related higher local government expenditures. It seems unlikely that the higher expenditures that did not develop due to sprawl in the last 50 years will evolve in the next 20 year, despite predictions to the contrary in The Costs of Sprawl 2000 research.\n\nIt seems much more likely that the differences in municipal expenditures per capita are the result of political, rather than economic factors, especially the influence of special interests.\n\nThe phrase \"smart growth\" implies that other growth and development theories are not \"smart\". There is debate about whether transit-proximate development constitutes smart growth when it is not transit-oriented. The National Motorists Association does not object to smart growth as a whole, but strongly objects to traffic calming, which is intended to reduce automobile accidents and fatalities, but may also reduce automobile usage and increase alternate forms of public transportation.\n\nIn 2002 the National Center for Public Policy Research, a self-described conservative think tank, published an economic study entitled \"Smart Growth and Its Effects on Housing Markets: The New Segregation\" which termed smart growth \"restricted growth\" and suggested that smart growth policies disfavor minorities and the poor by driving up housing prices.\n\nSome libertarian groups, such as the Cato Institute, criticize smart growth on the grounds that it leads to greatly increased land values, and people with average incomes can no longer afford to buy detached houses.\n\nA number of ecological economists claim that industrial civilization has already \"overshot\" the carrying capacity of the Earth, and \"smart growth\" is mostly an illusion. Instead, a steady state economy would be needed to bring human societies back into a necessary balance with the ability of the ecosystem to sustain humans (and other species).\n\nA study released in November 2009 characterized the smart-growth policies in the U.S. state of Maryland as a failure, concluding that \"[t]here is no evidence after ten years that [smart-growth laws] have had any effect on development patterns.\" Factors include a lack of incentives for builders to redevelop older neighborhoods and limits on the ability of state planners to force local jurisdictions to approve high-density developments in \"smart-growth\" areas. Buyers demand low-density development and because voters tend to oppose high density developments near them.\n\nBeginning in 2010, groups generally associated with the Tea Party movement began to identify Smart Growth as an outgrowth of the United Nations Agenda 21 which they viewed as an attempt by international interests to force a \"sustainable\" lifestyle on the United States. However planning groups and even some smart growth opponents counter that Smart Growth concepts and groups predate the 1992 Agenda 21 conference. In addition the word \"sustainable development\" as used in the Agenda 21 report is often misread to mean real estate development when it typically refers to the much broader concept of human development in the United Nations and foreign aid context which addresses a broader slate of economic, health, poverty, and education issues.\n\nRelated topics\n\nOrganizations\n\n\n"}

The 'chi-' is a prefix used to form language names, the equivalent of 'ki' in kiSwahili or 'se' in seTswana.\n\nThe Tonga language of Malawi is described as \"similar\" to Tumbuka, and Turner's dictionary lists only those words which differ from the Tumbuka, with the added comment that \"the Tonga folk, being rapid speakers, slur or elide the final syllable of many words, e.g. \"kulira\" becomes \"kuliya\", \"kukura\" becomes \"kukuwa\", \"kutoa\" becomes \"kuto’\".\" Tonga (Nyasa), i.e. Malawian Tonga, is grouped in the Glottolog classification along with Tumbuka in a single group.

As he walked along, the bag was coming behind him.\n\nWhen he was on his way, Hare came up behind him and said, \"I've found it, my bag!\" Tortoise said \"No, you're lying, see this string I've tied now I'm pulling it as I go.\" Hare refused to accept this and said \"Let's go the Court, it will judge us.\" The Court examined the case and cut Tortoise's string which he'd tied the bag with. They took that bag and gave it to Hare. Another day when Hare was walking along, Tortoise found him and said, \"I've got my tail!\" Hare said, \"Nonsense, this is my tail, Tortoise.\" Tortoise refused to accept this and said, \"What I've got is mine.\" They went to the Court so that it could make a judgement. In that Court, the case went in Tortoise's favour. They cut off Hare's tail and gave it to Tortoise.)\n\nThe Tonga language is tonal, with underlying tones High and non-High. Unlike Tumbuka, the high tones are not confined to the penultimate syllable of the word, but can be found in different places in different words.\n\nMost verb roots in Tonga are toneless, although there are a few such as \"bangulá\" \"shout\" or \"sambirá\" \"learn\" which have a tone on the final syllable of the stem. When a tone is final, as in the verb \"bangulá\" \"shout\", it tends to spread backwards to the penultimate syllable, giving the result \"bangǔlá\" (where \"ǔ\" represents a rising tone).\n\nSome of the Chitonga tenses are formed as follows:\n\nPresent habitual or continuous:\n\nMonosyllabic verbs or verbs starting with a vowel add \"-t(ú)-\" in this tense:\n\nPast simple:\n\nPast habitual:\n\nDistant future:\n"}

He was born in Jalandhar, Punjab. In 1933 he wrote his second short story collection in Urdu called \"Aurat Ki Fitrat\", the foreword of which was written by Munshi Premchand. Ashk began his literary career writing in Urdu but he switched to Hindi on the advice of Munshi Premchand. He joined All India Radio in 1941 where Krishan Chander, Patras Bokhari and Saadat Hasan Manto were among his colleagues. He settled in Allahabad in the late 40's. He was the first Hindi dramatist to receive the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for playwriting in 1965.\n\nUpendranath Ashk was born Upendranath Sharma to a Saraswat Brahmin family in Jalandhar, Panjab. Ashk began composing Panjabi couplets at the age of 11, and began writing in Urdu in 1926, under the tutelage of the Jalandhari poet Mohammad Ali \"Azar\". His first Urdu poem was published in the Sunday supplement of the popular Lahore-based Urdu daily \"Milap\". In 1930, while still in college, he published his first collection of short stories, titled Nau Ratan. It was during this phase that he adopted the nom de plume 'Ashk' ('teardrop' in Urdu) in keeping with the Urdu tradition of taking a \"takhallus\". The takhallus was chosen in honour of a childhood friend, whose death left a lasting impression on him. After graduating from college in 1931, Ashk taught at his alma mater for a few months before leaving for Lahore with the poet-journalist Mela Ram \"Wafa\". For the next three years he worked for Lala Lajpat Rai's newspaper Vande Mataram as a reporter, and then worked his way up as a translator and then assistant editor for the Daily \"Veer Bharat\" and the weekly \"Bhoochal\". During this time he continued to publish poems and short stories in local journals. He also married his first wife, Sheela Devi, in 1932. In 1932, on the advice of the celebrated Hindi author Premchand with whom he maintained a correspondence, Ashk switched to writing in Hindi, painstakingly writing each story in Urdu first and then translating it into Hindi. His second collection of short stories, \"Aurat ki Fitrat\", was published in Hindi in 1933, with an introduction by Premchand. In 1934, financial and other problems in his family made Ashk decide that he must adopt a more secure career path. He resolved to study for a law degree and become a sub-judge. But just as he completed his degree, his wife, Sheela Devi, died from tuberculosis. In a state of profound grief, Ashk abandoned his plan to enter the legal profession and resolved to become a full-time independent author. At this juncture he also resolved to write realistically about suffering and poverty. In 1936, he published the short story \"Ḍāchī\" which was considered a milestone in progressive realism in Hindi-Urdu fiction.\n\nHis son, Neelabh Ashk, was also a poet and translator.\n\nIn 1941, after living for two years at the commune Preetnagar near Amritsar, where he edited the Hindi-Urdu journal Preet Lari, Ashk was hired at All India Radio (AIR) as a playwright and Hindi adviser. Other notable writers associated with AIR at that time included Sa'adat Hasan Manto, Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, Miraji, Rashid, Krishan Chander and Rajinder Singh Bedi. Also living in Delhi at the time were Hindi authors Agyeya, Shivdan Singh Chauhan, Jainendra Kumar, Banarsi Das Chaturvedi, Vishnu Prabhakar and Girija Kumar Mathur. During this period, Ashk began work on his semi-autobiographical novel \"Girtī Dīvārẽ\" ('Falling Walls'). In 1941, Ashk also separated from his second wife with whom he had had a short-lived marriage, and married Kaushalya Devi.\n\nIn 1944, Ashk moved to Bombay, where he began as a dialogue and screenplay writer for the production company Filmistan. At Filmistan, Ashk worked closely with Shashdhar Mukherji and the director Nitin Bose. He wrote dialogues, stories and songs and even acted in two films: Mazdoor, directed by Nitin Bose, and Aath Din, directed by Ashok Kumar. While in Bombay, Ashk became involved with IPTA and wrote one of his most noted plays, \"Tūfān se Pahale\", which was produced for the stage by Balraj Sahni. The play, which was critical of communalism, was later banned by the British government. In 1946, Ashk contracted Tuberculosis and in early 1947, he was moved the Bel Air Sanatorium in Panchgani. Ashk remained in the sanatorium for two years, during which time Girtī Dīvārẽ was first published, in 1947, and he also composed his well-known poem \"Barghad kī Beṭī\".\n\nIn 1948, Ashk and the Hindi poet Nirala were each awarded Rs. 5000 by the government of the state of Uttar Pradesh to aid them in recovery from their illnesses. This largesse from the U.P. government encouraged Ashk to move to the literary city of Allahabad, where he would live until his death in 1996.\n\nHe wrote \"over a hundred books in almost all genres of literature\", including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "542083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=542083", "title": "Vocal range", "text": "Vocal range\n\nVocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate. Its most common application is within the context of singing, where it is used as a defining characteristic for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types. It is also a topic of study within linguistics, phonetics, and speech and language pathology, particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders, although it has little practical application in terms of speech.\n\nWhile the broadest definition of \"vocal range\" is simply the span from the lowest to the highest note a particular voice can produce, this broad definition is often not what is meant when \"vocal range\" is discussed in the context of singing. Vocal pedagogists tend to define the vocal range as the total span of \"musically useful\" pitches that a singer can produce. This is because some of the notes a voice can produce may not be considered usable by the singer within performance for various reasons. For example, within opera all singers must project over an orchestra without the aid of a microphone. An opera singer would therefore only be able to include the notes that they are able to adequately project over an orchestra within his or her vocal range. In contrast, a pop artist could include notes that could be heard with the aid of a microphone.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the use of different forms of vocal production. The human voice is capable of producing sounds using different physiological processes within the larynx. These different forms of voice production are known as vocal registers. While the exact number and definition of vocal registers is a controversial topic within the field of singing, the sciences identify only four registers: the whistle register, the falsetto register, the modal register, and the vocal fry register. Typically only the usable pitches within the modal register—the register used in normal speech and most singing—are included when determining singers' vocal ranges. There are exceptions, as in opera, where countertenors employ falsetto and coloratura sopranos use the whistle register; notes from these registers would therefore be included in the vocal ranges of these voices.\n\nVocal range plays such an important role in classifying singing voices into voice types that sometimes the two terms are confused with one another. A voice type is a particular kind of human singing voice perceived as having certain identifying qualities or characteristics; vocal range being only one of those characteristics. Other factors are vocal weight, vocal tessitura, vocal timbre, vocal transition points, physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal registration. All of these factors combined are used to categorize a singer's voice into a particular kind of singing voice or voice type.\n\nThe discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are several systems in use including the German Fach system, the Italian opera tradition, and French opera tradition. There are other systems of classification as well, most commonly the choral music system.\n\nNo system is universally applied or accepted. Most of the voice types identified by such systems, however, are sub-types that fall under seven different major voice categories that are for the most part acknowledged across all of the major voice classification systems. Women are typically divided into three main groups: soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto. Men are usually divided into four main groups: countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass. When considering the pre-pubescent voices of children an eighth term, treble, can be applied. Within each of these major categories there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like coloratura facility and vocal weight to differentiate between voices.\n\nVocal range itself does not determine a singer's voice type. While each voice type does have a general vocal range associated with it, human singing voices may possess vocal ranges that encompass more than one voice type or are in between the typical ranges of two voice types. Therefore, voice teachers use vocal range as only one factor among many in classifying a singer's voice. More important than range in voice classification is tessitura, or where the voice is most comfortable singing, and vocal timbre, or the characteristic sound of the singing voice. For example, a female singer may have a vocal range that encompasses the high notes of a mezzo-soprano and the low notes of a soprano. A voice teacher would therefore look to see whether the singer were more comfortable singing higher, or lower. If the singer were more comfortable singing higher, then the teacher would probably classify her as a soprano. The teacher would also consider the sound of the voice; sopranos tend to have a lighter and less rich vocal sound than a mezzo-soprano. A voice teacher, however, would never classify a singer in more than one voice type, regardless of the size of the vocal range of the singer.\n\nWithin the operatic systems of classification, there are six basic voice types. The ranges given below are approximations and are not meant to be too rigidly applied.\n\n\nSome men, in falsetto voice or as a result of certain rare physiological conditions, can sing in the same range as women. These do not fall into the female categories, instead called countertenors within classical music. Within contemporary music, however, the use of the term \"tenor\" for these male voices would be more appropriate.\n\nWithin choral music there are only four categories for adult singers. First, for women: soprano and alto, and for men: tenor and bass.\n\nIn the UK, the term \"male alto\" refers to a man who uses falsetto vocal production to sing in the alto section of a chorus. This practice is much less common outside the UK where the term countertenor is more often applied. Countertenors are also widely employed within opera as solo vocalists, though the term \"male alto\" is never used to refer to a solo vocalist.\n\nChildren's voices, both male and female, are described as \"trebles\", although boy soprano is widely used as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "494730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=494730", "title": "Xul Solar", "text": "Xul Solar\n\nXul Solar was the adopted name of Oscar Agustín Alejandro Schulz Solari (December 14, 1887 – April 9, 1963), Argentine painter, sculptor, writer, and inventor of imaginary languages.\n\nHe was born in San Fernando, Buenos Aires Province, in the bosom of a cosmopolitan family. His father, Elmo Schulz Riga, of Baltic German origin, was born in the Latvian city of Riga, at that time part of Imperial Russia. His mother, originally from Italy, was named Agustina Solari. He was educated in Buenos Aires, first as a musician, then as an architect (although he never completed his architectural studies). After working as a schoolteacher and holding a series of minor jobs in the municipal bureaucracy, on April 5, 1912, he set out on the ship \"England Carrier\", supposedly to work his passage to Hong Kong, but he disembarked in London and made his way to Turin. He returned to London to meet up with his mother and aunt, with whom he traveled to Paris, Turin (again), Genoa, and his mother's native Zoagli. Over the following few years, despite the onset of World War I, he would move among these cities, as well as Tours, Marseille, and Florence; towards the end of the war he served at the Argentine consulate in Milan.\n\nDuring the years of the war, he struck up what was to be a lifelong friendship with Argentine artist Emilio Pettoruti, then a young man living in Italy and associated with the futurists. Also around that time, he began to pay more attention to painting, first with watercolor (which would always remain his main medium as a painter), although he gradually began working in tempera and – very occasionally — oils. He also adopted the pen-name of Xul Solar. His first major exhibition of his art was in 1920 in Milan, together with sculptor Arturo Martini.\n\nIn 1916, Schulz Solari first signed his work \"Xul Solar,” ostensibly for the purposes to simplify the phonetics of his name, but an examination of the adopted name reveals that the first name is the reverse of \"lux,” which means \"light\" in Latin. Combined with \"solar\", the name reads as \"the light of the sun\", and demonstrates the artist's affinity for the universal source of light and energy. His father's name \"Schulz\" and \"Xul\" are pronounced the same in Spanish.\nDuring the years that followed he continued his travels, extending his orbit to Munich and Hamburg. In 1924, his work was exhibited in Paris in a show of Latin American artists. He also struck up an acquaintance with British Mage Aleister Crowley and his mistress Leah Hirsig who held high hopes for his discipleship, but later that year he returned to Buenos Aires, where he promptly became associated with the \"avant garde\" \"Florida group\" (a.k.a. \"Martín Fierro group\"), a circle that also included Jorge Luis Borges, with whom he was to keep an association and close friendship. It was in this group that he also met poet and novelist Leopoldo Marechal who would immortalize him as the astrologer Schultze in his famous novel \"Adán Buenosayres\". He began to exhibit frequently in the galleries of Buenos Aires, notably in a 1926 exhibition of modern painters that included Norah Borges (sister of Jorge Luis Borges) and Emilio Pettoruti. Throughout the rest of his life, he would exhibit regularly in Buenos Aires and Montevideo, Uruguay, but he would not have another major European exhibition until his twilight years: in 1962, a year before his death, he had a major exposition at the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris. In 1963 he died in his house at Tigre, Buenos Aires, 5 years before his biography by Emilio Pettoruti was published.\n\nSolar's paintings are mainly sculptures, often using striking contrasts and bright colours, typically in relatively small formats. His visual style seems equidistant between Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee on the one hand and Marc Chagall on the other. He also worked in some extremely unorthodox artistic media, such as modifying pianos, including a version with three rows of keys.\n\nThe poet Fernando Demaría in an essay \"Xul Solar y Paul Klee\" (published in the Argentine magazine \"Lyra\", 1971, and quoted extensively at ), wrote, \"It is not easy for the human spirit to elevate itself from astrology to astronomy, but we would be making a mistake if we forget that an authentic astrologer, like Xul Solar, is close to the source of the stars... The primitivism of Xul Solar is anterior to the appearance of the Gods. The Gods correspond to a more evolved form of energy.\"\n\nSolar had a strong interest in astrology; at least as early as 1939 he began to draw astrological charts. He also had a strong interest in Buddhism and believed strongly in reincarnation. He also developed his own set of Tarot cards. His paintings reflect his religious beliefs, featuring objects as stairs, roads and the representation of God.\n\nHe invented two fully elaborated imaginary languages, symbols from which figure in his paintings, and was also an exponent of duodecimal mathematics. He said of himself \"I am maestro of a writing no one reads yet.\" One of his invented languages was called \"Neo Criollo\", a poetic fusion of Portuguese and Spanish, which he reportedly would frequently use as a spoken language in talking to people. He also invented a \"Pan Lingua\", which aspired to be a world language linking mathematics, music, astrology and the visual arts, an idea reminiscent of Hermann Hesse's \"glass bead game\". Indeed, games were a particular interest of his, including his own invented version of chess, or more precisely \"\"non-chess\".\" \n\nOutside of Argentina, Solar may best be known for his association with Borges. In 1940, he figured as a minor character in Borges's semi-fictional \"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\"; in 1944, he illustrated a limited edition (300 copies) of \"Un modelo para la muerte\", written by Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares, writing together under the pseudonym B. Suárez Lynch. He and Borges had common interests in German expressionistic poetry, the works of Emanuel Swedenborg, Algernon Charles Swinburne and William Blake, and Eastern philosophy, especially Buddhism and the I Ching.\n\nAfter a brief experimentation with oils, Xul chose the watercolors and tempera that would become his preferred media. Instead of large-scale canvases, Xul painted on small sheets of paper, sometimes mounting his finished works on sheets of cardboard. One of his early works in what would become his signature format, \"Entierro\" demonstrates the confluence of Xul's internal thoughts and external influences.\n\nThe image is of a funeral procession of beings, possibly celestial, led by an angel-figure floating above the ground. The profiles of the figures suggest pre-Columbian art, and possibly an ancient Egyptian influence, as well. The angel-figure as well as the mourners have luminous peaks above their heads, in a re-imagining of halos. The shapes of the peaks are repeated by tongues of fire that point up from the bottom edge of the painting. The image strongly suggests an afterworld, but it is not clear from the image whether the environment correlates to tradition Christian understandings of heaven or hell. Xul Solar provides his viewer with a new image of an afterlife.\n\nTwo figures hold a shrouded corpse, which is also surrounded by flames. The hands of the corpse are folded, but above the corpse, a figure resembling a fetus emerges. That Xul uses a fetus instead of an image of a deceased person of typical age leads one to read the image as a depiction of reincarnation, representing a break from traditional Catholic ideas of life and death, and demonstrating the investigation into disparate spiritualities which would continue for the rest of Xul's life. As the figures recede in the painting, Xul reduces them to geometric shapes. The forms cease to be recognizable as beings, and then are transformed into what can be a tomb, or portal. That all the mourners are of the same color as the temple indicates that they, just like the deceased, will make the same transition someday.\n\nXul Solar's life during his twenties was marked by profound existential crisis. His writings at the time reveal a profound desire for creative expression, and a kind of angst caused by the profusion of ideas and thoughts he entertained, \n“Dazzling light, colors never seen, harmonies of ecstasies and of hell, unheard-of sounds, a new beauty that is mine… If my damaging sorrows are due to labor in childbirth, I am pregnant with an immense, new world!”\nGradowczyk describes Xul at this point in his life as “a visionary rabidly opposed to the canons reigning in the Buenos Aires of his time\". Like other artistically-inclined people of his generation, Xul sought to study in Europe, and settled for a time in Paris while it was an epicenter for avant-garde art. The city was home to the Cubists, while attracting Italian futurists, Russian artists, and participating in the dialogue about German Expressionism. There was also a fashion for sculpture and objects brought back to Europe by anthropologists and traders from African and Pacific Ocean colonies, as well as the Americas.\n\nThe artistic canons that Gradowczyk refers to were propagated by the official Argentine art institutions, who favored visual representations associated with national icons. Painters like Carlos Ripamonte, Cesáreo Quirós, and Fernando Fader extolled images of pampas landscapes and rural gaucho culture. The arrival of Spanish intellectuals such as José Ortega y Gasset and Eugenio D’Ors created a new discourse around art that was disseminated among writers and artists working toward an aesthetic modernity. Entierros firmly places Xul Solar as a member of this modernist Argentine movement. Rather than painting subjects recognizable as Argentine, Xul’s focus is internal, painting from his own imagination. His early artistic output seems to represent the profusion of ideas and themes that grew out of Xul's contemplations. The flat shapes and bold colors used in the painting demonstrate a Cubist influence. The faces of the figures, particularly the eyes and shapes of heads can be seen as owing to the fashion for art and artifacts from Africa and the Americas mentioned above.\n\nThe severe, bleak, landscape in \"Fiordo\" suggests ancient Chinese and Japanese prints. Narrow mountains with undulating edges stab up from placid water. Here, Xul communicates his affinity with Asian forms and, in turn, ideas. The ladders that criss-cross the mountains, are described by Gradowczyk as symbolizing spirituality, both of the ascendant nature as well as with the possibility of descent. The single figure in the bottom corner suggests a hermetic existence, a difficult spiritual path that is mirrored in the steep staircases. The figure holds a book in one hand and what appears to be a lantern in the other, representing study and guidance. Xul tells his viewer that while spiritual pursuit can be arduous, others have established a path, and they point the way. A structure appears atop one mountain, ostensibly a temple. None of the ladders lead directly to the mountain peak, however. The path twists and turns, and the doors cut into the mountainsides represent the stages, and possible moments of being waylaid, as one endeavors spiritually.\n\nFrom 1943 and 1944, Xul’s painting was influenced by his thoughts of the Second World War. The sudden, powerful emergence of inhumanity and the potential effects on the world at large wore very heavy on the artist. Gradowczyk posits that “Xul reached his highest point of artistic expressivity in these ascetic paintings whose theme corresponded to that anguishing reality.\n\nIn 1939, Xul initiated a project to establish a “universal club,” which he called “Pan Klub” in Neocriollo. His purpose was to create a type of salon for intellectuals and those of mutual interests, and inaugurated the club at his home. Nearly fifty years later, his widow, Micaela (Lita) Cadenas established the Fundación Pan Klub, based on the original precepts set by Xul during his lifetime. This foundation established the Museo Xul Solar in 1993, in a building whose design was based on Xul's work. The Museo exhibits works that Xul himself selected for the Pan Klub, as well as houses objects, sculptures, and the documents compiling his personal archive. The Fundacion also preserves Xul's home, where his extensive library is located.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1996, an Argentine literary magazine named \"Xul\" was published. In the essay that accompanied the publication of its anthology, several reasons are given for why the magazine was named as such. The last paragraph of the essay begins, \"What should have been first remains for the last: XUL, the name of the magazine, was an homage to Xul Solar, a singularly complex individual, writer among many other things, although he was known mainly as one of the principal plastic artists of Argentina.” \n\n\"I am a world champion of a game that nobody yet knows called panchess (\"Panajedrez\"). I am master of a script that nobody yet reads. I am creator of a technique, of a musical grafía that allows the piano to be studied in a third of the usual time that it takes today. I am director of a theatre that as yet has not begun working. I am creator of a universal language called panlingua based on numbers and astrology that will help people know each other better. I am creator of twelve painting techniques, some of them surrealist, and others that transpose a sensory, emotional world on to canvas, and that will produce in those that listen a Chopin suite, a Wagnerian prelude, or a stanza sung by Beniamino Gigli. I am the creator, and this is what most interests me at the moment, apart from the exhibition of painting that I am preparing, of a language that is desperately needed by Latin America.”\n\n-From Xul Solar’s own writings\n\n\"Although this is a time when art is more individual and arbitrary than ever, it would be a mistake to call it anarchic. In spite of so much confusion, there exists a well-defined tendency toward simplicity of means, toward clear and solid architecture, toward the pure plastic sense that protects and accents abstract meanings of line, mass, and color, all within a complete liberty of subject and composition…\n\nLet us admit, in any case, that among us now – if mostly still hidden – are many or all of the seeds of our future art, and not in museums overseas, and not in the homes of famous foreign dealers. Let us honor the rare ones, our rebellious spirits who, like this artist, before denying others, find affirmation in themselves; that instead of destroying, seek to build. Let us honor those who struggle so that the soul of our country can be more beautiful.\n\nBecause the wars of independence for our America are not yet over…”\n\n-Excerpted from an article written in anticipation of Emilio Pettoruti’s first Buenos Aires exhibition for the magazine \"Martín Fierro\", October 9, 1924\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is also known as Corentin Cariou and Tin Gariou.\n\nHe was born in Pont-l'Abbé, Finistère into a poor family. His father died in 1911, leaving eight children to be raised by his young widow. Taken in by Catholic missionaries, he moved to Spain as a seminarian, living in the Basque region and then Castille. He met Jakez Riou and while conducting literary, scientific and religious studies, they explored the literary potential of the Breton language, aspiring to give it a refined form unsullied by convention.\n\nHaving abandoned his religious training, he met, while on military service in Rennes, officials of the nationalist group \"Unvaniezh Yaouankiz Breiz\", which led to the publication of his first article in support of Breton nationalism in the journal \"Breiz Atao\".\n\nIn 1924, he became a journalist with the \"Courrier du Finistère\". He participated in the Quimper Pan-Celtic Congress of 1924, with François Debeauvais, Yann Sohier, Jakez Riou, Abeozen, and Marcel Guieysse, under the banner of \"Breiz Atao\". He later worked for \"Gwalarn\", the literary magazine founded in 1922 by Roparz Hemon and Olier Mordrel, where he established himself by publishing Breton translations from Spanish (Calderon) and ancient Greek (Aeschylus). He also published his own poetry, notably \"Nozvez arkus e beg an enezenn\" (\"Night Watch at the Edge of the Island\"), written in memory of Jakez Riou in 1938.\n\nHe also translated books for children, for example Beatrix Potter. These were published by \"Gwalarn\", and were distributed free in schools to children who had participated in essay competitions in the Breton language.\n\nDrezen's translations led to a full-time career as a writer. He produced a rich and varied \"oeuvre\" of poems, novels and plays, always written entirely in Breton. Some novels have been translated into French (by Pêr-Jakez Helias among others). He is considered one of the best writers in Breton, because he knew how to mix vivid expression with a quest for literary perfection, sometimes through euphony.\n\nHe joined the Breton art and literary movement Seiz Breur. His Breton epic \"Kan da Gornog\" was published with important illustrations by René-Yves Creston.\n\nDuring World War II, Drezen regularly published articles in the Nationalist periodical \"L'Heure Bretonne\", an organ of the Breton National Party. He also wrote for Mordrel's \"Stur\", \"Galv\" (edited by Henri Le Helloco) and in Yann Fouéré's \"La Bretagne\".\n\nIn 1941, he published the first full-length novel in Breton, \"Itron Varia Garmez\", which was about the lives of ordinary people in Pont-l'Abbé during the Great Depression (French edition, Denoël, 1943, as \"Notre-Dame Bigoudenn\"). It was also illustrated by Creston. Shortly afterwards, he freelanced for \"Radio Rennes Bretagne\", writing radio plays and giving talks.\n\nIn 1943, he edited the bilingual newspaper \"Arvor\". In this paper wrote many anti-American articles about the bombing of Nantes, which reflected widespread local resentment of the attacks. He was arrested in 1944, but released after a few months.\n\nAfter the war he remained in Nantes, where he ran a café. He continued to write for \"Al Liamm\", the journal that succeeded \"Gwalarn\". He also wrote an autobiographical novel \"Skol-Louarn Veig Trebern\" about his impoverished youth. He died in Lorient in 1972.\n"}
