The compound itself was located just half a mile from Pakistan's premier military training academy Kakul Military Academy (PMA) in Abbottabad.\n\nIn the aftermath of bin Laden's death, US-President Barack Obama asked Pakistan to investigate the network that sustained bin Laden. \"We think that there had to be some sort of support network for bin Laden inside of Pakistan,\" Obama said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview with CBS News. He also added that the United States was not sure \"who or what that support network was.\" In addition to this, in an interview with \"Time\" magazine, CIA Director Leon Panetta stated that US-officials did not alert Pakistani counterparts to the raid because they feared the terrorist leader would be warned.\n\nAccording to Fred Burton, vice-president of the global intelligence firm Stratfor, officials of ISI, Pakistani military, along with one retired Pakistani military general, had knowledge of the arrangements made for bin Laden and the safe house. Bin Laden's compound was razed that day at his Abbottabad safe house.\n\nDavid Ignatius in \"Washington Post\" referred to the claim of the former ISI chief General Ziauddin Butt that the Abbottabad compound was used by the Intelligence Bureau and noted that a report in the Pakistani press in December had quoted him as saying that Osama's stay at Abbottabad was arranged by Brigadier (retired) Ijaz Shah, senior ISI officer and the head of the Intelligence Bureau during 2004–2008, on Pervez Musharraf's orders. Later Butt denied making any such statement.\n\nCritics cited the very close proximity (800 yards) of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound (a custom-built luxury complex) to the Pakistan's National Military Academy (PMA), Pakistan's \"West Point\", and that the United States chose not to notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the alleged double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. US-government files leaked by WikiLeaks disclosed that American diplomats were told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time US-forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) also helped smuggle al Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had told US-officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.\n\nThe CIA Director and the US defense secretary Leon Panetta stated that Pakistan was \"either involved or incompetent.\" In an interview to CBC television, \n\nObviously the concern has always been how could a compound like this, how could bin Laden be in an area where there were military establishments, where we could see the military operating and not have them know. \n\nRegarding the US decision to withhold intelligence about the raid from Pakistan, he said, \n\nThe concern we had is that...we had provided intelligence to them with regards to other areas and unfortunately, for one way or another, it got leaked to the individuals we were trying to go after, so as a result of that we were concerned that if we were going to perform a sensitive mission like this, we had to do it on our own. \n\nTalking about the support network Panetta stated that some \"lower rank\" officers in the military knew where Bin Laden was hiding. The defense secretary said, \n\nWell, you know, these situations sometimes, the leadership within Pakistan is obviously not aware of certain things and yet people lower down in the military establishment find it very well, they've been aware of it, ...But bottom line is that we have not had evidence that provides that direct link.\n\nHusain Haqqani the former-Pakistan Ambassador to the United States, who earlier said both countries \"cooperated in making sure\" that the operation leading to bin Laden's death was \"successful\", has admitted that Osama bin laden indeed had a support system in Pakistan, albeit without the Pakistani government being privy to this fact.\n\nObviously, bin Laden did have a support system (in Pakistan). The issue was that support system within the government and the state of Pakistan or within the society of Pakistan, ...We all know that there are people in Pakistan who share the same belief system as bin Laden and other extremists... So that is a fact, that there are people who probably protected him... We did not know. We had no knowledge [about Bin Laden]. And if we had knowledge, we would have acted upon it long ago\" —Mr. Haqqani said in an interview.\n\nA Pakistani official, speaking anonymously, said \"We assisted only in terms of authorization of the helicopter flights in our airspace\" and that \"we did not want anything to do with such an operation in case something went wrong.\"\n\nUS Senator Joe Lieberman, Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said \"This is going to be a time of real pressure on Pakistan to basically prove to us that they didn't know that bin Laden was there\". John O. Brennan, Obama's chief counterterrorism advisor, said that it was inconceivable that bin Laden did not have support from within Pakistan. He further stated: \"People have been referring to this as hiding in plain sight. We are looking at how he was able to hide out there for so long.\" Senator Dianne Feinstein said that \"it's hard for me to understand how the Pakistanis ... would not know what was going on inside the compound\", and that top Pakistan officials may be \"walking both sides of the street.\" Senator Lindsey Graham questioned, \"How could [bin Laden] be in such a compound without being noticed?\", raising suspicions that Pakistan was either uncommitted in the fight against Islamist militants or was actively sheltering them while pledging to fight them. A Pakistani intelligence official said that they had passed on raw phone tap data to the United States that led to the operation, but had failed to analyze this data themselves. Carl Levin who is chairman United States Senate Committee on Armed Services stated that he believes Pakistani officials knew the location of bin Laden and had \"no doubt\" they also know the location of other senior al-Qaeda operatives. He said Pakistan's intelligence and army have \"got a lot of explaining to do,\" given that bin Laden was holed up in such a large house with surrounding buildings, the fact that its residents took the unusual step of burning their garbage and avoiding any trash collection. He further stated, \"It's hard to imagine that the military or police did not have any ideas what was going on inside of that.\" After the raid, the US asked that Pakistan identify its top intelligence operatives as it tried to establish if any of them had contact with bin Laden in the last few years.\n\nMosharraf Zaidi, a leading Pakistani columnist, stated, \"It seems deeply improbable that bin Laden could have been where he was killed without the knowledge of some parts of the Pakistani state.\"\n\nWikiLeaks had revealed that a US diplomatic dispatch told the Americans that \"many\" inside Pakistan knew where bin Laden was. The document stated that \"In Pakistan, Osama Bin Laden wasn't an invisible man, and many knew his whereabouts in North Waziristan, but whenever security forces attempted a raid on his hideouts, the enemy received warning of their approach from sources in the security forces.\"\n\nIndian Minister for Home Affairs P. Chidambaram said that bin Laden hiding \"deep inside\" Pakistan was a matter of grave concern for India, and showed that \"many of the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks, including the controllers and the handlers of the terrorists who actually carried out the attack, continue to be sheltered in Pakistan\". He called on Pakistan to arrest them.\n\n\"The Globe and Mail\" reported local police saying that the compound belonged to Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant group supported by ISI which is fighting Indian forces in Kashmir.\n\nIn October 2011, former Pakistani Army Chief, General Ziauddin Butt has asserted that Osama bin Laden was kept in an Intelligence Bureau safe house in Abbottabad by the then Director-General of the Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan (2004–2008), Brigadier Ijaz Shah. According to him, this had occurred with the \"full knowledge\" of former army chief General Pervez Musharraf and possibly that of current Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani.\n\nAccording to a police report dated Jan. 17, 2012 Osama Bin Laden's youngest wife Amal Ahmad Abdul Fatah claims that except for the eight or nine months just after 9/11, Laden skipped from home to home in Peshawar, Swat and Haripur, Pakistan before settling in Abbottabad for about the last six years of his life.\n\nIn December 2017, former USA President Barack Obama said: \"We had no evidence that Pakistani government was aware of Osama bin Laden's presence there but that is something obviously we looked at.\"\n\nIn a 2005 interview, the then-president Musharraf emphatically denied bin Laden was in Pakistan, stating \"One thing is very sure, let me assure you, that we are not going to hide him for a rainy day and then release him to take advantage.\"\n\nPakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari denied that his country's security forces may have sheltered Osama bin Laden, and called any supposed support for bin Laden by the Pakistani government \"baseless speculation.\" The Pakistani foreign office issued a statement that \"categorically denies\" media reports that Pakistan's leadership, \"civil as well as military, had any prior knowledge of the US operation against Osama bin Laden.\"\n\nPakistan's former president Pervez Musharraf denied that officials in his country were responsible, calling bin Laden's presence in Pakistan a \"blunder\". Musharraf said instead that there was a possibility that rogue lower-level members of Pakistan's intelligence and military may have had knowledge of bin Laden's location. He conceded they might have known during the last year of his presidency six years ago, and said there ought to be an investigation.\n\nAhmed Shuja Pasha, the head of Pakistan's powerful Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), conceded that Osama bin Laden's presence in Pakistan had been an \"intelligence failure\" but denied his ISI could have had any role in hiding Bin Laden. \"If we had shielded Osama bin Laden, why would we have killed and arrested so many al-Qaeda leaders?\" he stated \"Would we have hidden such a large target in such an exposed area? Without any guards or escape route?\"\n\nRegardless of Pakistan's claims about their previous conduct, many outside observers have raised ongoing concerns that most of the people jailed by them since Bin Laden's killing have been those who were trying to help capture him, rather than those who helped shield him.\n\nOne such incident would be when doctor Shakil Afridi who assisted the CIA in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, was arrested several weeks after the killing of bin Laden. A Pakistani court imposed a 33-year sentence on the doctor. The doctor was eventually tried under a tribal judicial system that denies the accused the right to have an attorney or to present evidence. According to \"Washington post\", the Doctor could have received the death penalty if he had been tried under normal Pakistani law.\n\n″It is now indisputable that militancy in Pakistan is supported by the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence). Pakistan's fight against militancy is bogus. It's just to extract money from America,″ Dr Shakil Afridi stated in an interview with Fox News. He was interviewed from inside Peshawar Central Jail, where he is being held by Pakistani authorities. According to his statements, the Pakistani authorities said, 'The Americans are our worst enemies, worse than the Indians,' and he suffered ′crippling torture′ and ′psychological abuse′ during the 12 months he was held by Pakistani spy agency for helping the US. He further revealed the fact that the ISI is in collusion with terrorists.\n\nA judge-led inquiry set up by Pakistani government in 2011, based on interviews with 201 sources found there was evidence of incompetence at every level in the Pakistan's intelligence and security services and it did not rule out the involvement of rogue elements within the Pakistani intelligence service. The 336-page Abbottabad Commission Report, obtained in July 2013 by Al Jazeera, blasted Pakistan's civilian and military leadership for \"gross incompetence\" over the bin Laden affair. It found that by 2005, Pakistani intelligence was no longer actively pursuing intelligence that could lead to his capture. The report called the handling of the bin Laden situation a \"natural disaster\" and even called on the leadership to apologize to the people of Pakistan for their \"dereliction of duty.\" Al Jazeera reported that the government's intention in conducting the inquiry was likely aimed at \"regime continuance, when the regime is desperate to distance itself from any responsibility for the national disaster that occurred on its watch\" and was likely \"a reluctant response to an overwhelming public and parliamentary demand.\" Lack of intelligence on bid Laden's nine-year residence in the country was blamed on \"Government Implosion Syndrome.\" Lack of knowledge of a CIA support network without Pakistan being aware was \"a case of collective and sustained dereliction of duty by the political, military, and intelligence leadership.\" Although the report focused on the night of the raid, it had other findings. One was that bin Laden had been living in Pakistan since 2002, after surviving the Battle of Tora Bora. Another was that he and some family members moved into the compound in Abbottabad in 2005, the same year Pakistani intelligence stopped independently looking for him.\n\n\nThe United States suspended about a third of its $2.7 billion annual defense aid to Pakistan.\n\n"}

This is a time when an infant's attention moves from oral stimulation to anal stimulation (usually the bowels but occasionally the bladder), usually synchronous with learning to control their excretory functions, a time of toilet training. For a child in this stage of development, control of bowel movements is the stage at which the child can express autonomy by withholding, refusing to comply, or soiling himself or herself. Conflicts with bullying parents regarding toilet training can produce a fixation in this stage, which can manifest itself in adulthood by a continuation of erotic pleasure in defecation.\n\nAnal-expulsive refers to a personality trait present in people fixated in the anal stage of psychosexual development. The anal stage is the second of five stages of psychosexual development.\n\nIn modern times, psychosexual stages are considered to have limited value in understanding the more severe psychopathology.\n\n"}

In classical music, two of the most famous barcarolles are Jacques Offenbach's \"Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour\", from his opera \"The Tales of Hoffmann\"; and Frédéric Chopin's Barcarolle in F-sharp major for solo piano.\n\nA barcarolle is characterized by a rhythm reminiscent of the gondolier's stroke, almost invariably in 6/8 meter at a moderate tempo.\n\nWhile the most-famous barcarolles are from the Romantic period, the genre was known well enough in the 18th century for Burney to mention, in \"The Present State of Music in France and Italy\" (1771), that it was a celebrated form cherished by \"collectors of good taste\".\n\nThe barcarolle was a popular form in opera, where the apparently artless sentimental style of the folklike song could be put to good use. In addition to the Offenbach example: Paisiello, Weber, and Rossini wrote arias that were barcarolles; Donizetti set the Venetian scene at the opening of \"Marino Faliero\" (1835) with a barcarolle for a gondolier and chorus; and Verdi included a barcarolle in \"Un ballo in maschera\" (i.e., Richard's atmospheric \"Di’ tu se fidele il flutto m’aspetta\" in Act I). The traditional Neapolitan barcarolle \"Santa Lucia\" was published in 1849.\n\nArthur Sullivan set the entry of Sir Joseph Porter's barge (also bearing his sisters, cousins and aunts) in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" to a barcarolle, as well as the Trio \"My well-loved lord and guardian dear\" among Phyllis, Earl Tolloller and the Earl of Mountararat in Act I of \"Iolanthe\". Schubert, while not using the name specifically, used a style reminiscent of the barcarolle in some of his most-famous songs, including especially his haunting \"Auf dem Wasser zu singen\" (\"To be sung on the water\"), D.774.\n\nOther notable barcarolles include: the three \"Venetian Gondola Songs\" from Mendelssohn's \"Songs Without Words\", Opp. 19, 30 and 62; the \"June\" barcarolle from Tchaikovsky's \"The Seasons\"; Charles-Valentin Alkan's \"Barcarolle\" from the Op. 65 \"Troisième recueil de chants\"; Béla Bartók's \"Barcarolla\" from \"Out of Doors\"; Barcarolle, Op. 27, no. 1, by Moritz Moszkowski, and several examples by Anton Rubinstein, Mily Balakirev, Alexander Glazunov, Edward MacDowell, Mel Bonis, Ethelbert Nevin; and a series of thirteen for solo piano by Gabriel Fauré.\n\nIn the 20th century, further examples include: Agustín Barrios's \"Julia Florida\"; the second movement of Villa-Lobos's Trio No. 2 (1915) (which contains a Berceuse-Barcarolla); the first movement of Francis Poulenc's \"Napoli\" suite for solo piano (1925); George Gershwin's \"Dance of the Waves\" (1937, unpublished); Ned Rorem's three Barcarolles for piano, composed in Morocco (1949); the first movement of Nikolai Myaskovsky's Piano Sonata no. 8, op. 83 (1949); \"The Kings' Barcarolle\" from Leonard Bernstein's \"Candide\" (1956); and \"Agony\" from Stephen Sondheim's \"Into the Woods\".\n"}

{"id": "20948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20948", "title": "Brainwashing", "text": "Brainwashing\n\nBrainwashing (also known as mind control, menticide, coercive persuasion, thought control, thought reform, and re-education) is the concept that the human mind can be altered or controlled by certain psychological techniques. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject’s ability to think critically or independently, to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into the subject’s mind, as well as to change his or her attitudes, values, and beliefs. \n\nThe concept of brainwashing was originally developed in the 1950s to explain how the Chinese government appeared to make people cooperate with them. Advocates of the concept also looked at Nazi Germany, at some criminal cases in the United States, and at the actions of human traffickers. It was later applied by Margaret Singer, Philip Zimbardo and some others in the anti-cult movement to explain conversions to some new religious movements and other groups. This resulted in scientific and legal debate with Eileen Barker, James Richardson, and other scholars, as well as legal experts, rejecting at least the popular understanding of brainwashing.\n\nOther views have been expressed by scholars including: Dick Anthony, Robert Cialdini, Stanley A. Deetz, Michael J. Freeman, Robert Jay Lifton, Joost Meerloo, Daniel Romanovsky, Kathleen Taylor, Louis Jolyon West, and Benjamin Zablocki. The concept of brainwashing is sometimes involved in legal cases, especially regarding child custody; and is also a major theme in science fiction and in criticism of modern political and corporate culture. Although the term appears in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) of the American Psychiatric Association it is not accepted as scientific fact.\n\nThe Chinese term \"xǐnăo\" (洗脑，literally \"wash brain\") was originally used to describe the coercive persuasion used under the Maoist government in China, which aimed to transform \"reactionary\" people into \"right-thinking\" members of the new Chinese social system. The term punned on the Taoist custom of \"cleansing/washing the heart/mind\" (\"xǐxīn\"，洗心) before conducting ceremonies or entering holy places.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" records the earliest known English-language usage of the word \"brainwashing\" in an article by newspaperman Edward Hunter, in \"Miami News\", published on 24 September 1950. Hunter was an outspoken anticommunist and was said to be a CIA agent working undercover as a journalist. Hunter and others used the Chinese term to explain why, during the Korean War (1950-1953), some American prisoners of war (POWs) cooperated with their Chinese captors, even in a few cases defected to their side. British radio operator Robert W. Ford and British army Colonel James Carne also claimed that the Chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their war-era imprisonment.\n\nThe U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including biological warfare. After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote Frank Schwable, Chief of Staff of the First Marine Air Wing admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander Gen. Mark W. Clark asserted:\n\nBeginning in 1953, Robert Jay Lifton interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the Korean War as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. (Lifton's 1961 book \"\", was based on this research.) Lifton found that when the POWs returned to the United States their thinking soon returned to normal, contrary to the popular image of \"brainwashing.\"\n\nIn 1956, after reexamining the concept of brainwashing following the Korean War, the U.S. Army published a report entitled \"Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War\", which called brainwashing a \"popular misconception\". The report states \"exhaustive research of several government agencies failed to reveal even one conclusively documented case of 'brainwashing' of an American prisoner of war in Korea.\"\n\nIn George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" the main character is subjected to imprisonment, isolation, and torture in order to conform his thoughts and emotions to the wishes of the rulers of Orwell's fictional future totalitarian society. Orwell's vision influenced Hunter and is still reflected in the popular understanding of the concept of brainwashing. Written about the same time, J.R.R. Tolkien’s \"The Lord of the Rings\" also addressed brainwashing, although in a fantasy setting. The science fiction stories of Cordwainer Smith (written from the 1940s until his death in 1966) depict brainwashing to remove memories of traumatic events as a normal and benign part of future medical practice.\n\nIn the 1950s many American films were filmed that featured brainwashing of POWs, including \"The Rack\", \"The Bamboo Prison\", \"Toward the Unknown\", and \"The Fearmakers\". \"Forbidden Area\" told the story of Soviet secret agents who had been brainwashed through classical conditioning by their own government so they wouldn't reveal their identities. In 1962 \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (based on the 1959 novel by Richard Condon) \"put brainwashing front and center\" by featuring a plot by the Soviet government to take over the United States by use of a brainwashed presidential candidate. The concept of brainwashing became popularly associated with the research of Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov, which mostly involved dogs, not humans, as subjects. In \"The Manchurian Candidate\" the head brainwasher is Dr. Yen Lo, of the Pavlov Institute.\n\nMind control remains an important theme in science fiction. Terry O'Brien comments: \"Mind control is such a powerful image that if hypnotism did not exist, then something similar would have to have been invented: the plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore. The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image.\" A subgenre is \"corporate mind control\", in which a future society is run by one or more business corporations that dominate society using advertising and mass media to control the population's thoughts and feelings.\n\nFor twenty years starting in the early 1950s, the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Department of Defense conducted secret research, including Project MKUltra, in an attempt to develop practical brainwashing techniques; the results are unknown. (See also Sidney Gottlieb.) CIA experiments using various psychedelic drugs such as LSD and Mescaline drew from Nazi human experimentation.\n\nIn 1974, Patty Hearst, a member of the wealthy Hearst family, was kidnapped by a left-wing group calling itself the Symbionese Liberation Army. After several weeks of captivity she agreed to join the group and took part in their activities. In 1975, she was arrested and charged with bank robbery and use of a gun in committing a felony. Her attorney, F. Lee Bailey argued in her trial that she should not be held responsible for her actions since her treatment by her captors was the equivalent of the brainwashing of Korean War POWs. (See: diminished responsibility.) Hearst was found guilty, but her “brainwashing defense” brought the topic to renewed public attention in the United States, as did the 1969 to 1971 case of Charles Manson, who was said to have brainwashed his followers to commit murder and other crimes.\n\nBailey developed his case in conjunction with psychiatrist Louis Jolyon West and psychologist Margaret Singer. They had both studied the experiences of Korean War POWs. In 1996 Singer published her theories in her best-selling book \"Cults in Our Midst\". In 2003, the brainwashing defense was used unsuccessfully in the defense of Lee Boyd Malvo, who was charged with murder for his part in the D.C. sniper attacks. Some legal scholars have argued that the brainwashing defense undermines the law’s fundamental premise of free will.\n\nItaly has had controversy over the concept of \"plagio\", a crime consisting in an absolute psychological—and eventually physical—domination of a person. The effect is said to be the annihilation of the subject's freedom and self-determination and the consequent negation of his or her personality. The crime of plagio has rarely been prosecuted in Italy, and only one person was ever convicted. In 1981, an Italian court found that the concept is imprecise, lacks coherence, and is liable to arbitrary application. By the twenty-first century, the concept of brainwashing was being applied \"with some success\" in child custody and child sexual abuse cases. In some cases \"one parent is accused of brainwashing the child to reject the other parent, and in child sex abuse cases where one parent is accused of brainwashing the child to make sex abuse accusations against the other parent\" (possibly resulting in or causing parental alienation).\n\nIn 2003, forensic psychologist Dick Anthony said that \"no reasonable person would question that there are situations where people can be influenced against their best interests, but those arguments are evaluated on the basis of fact, not bogus expert testimony.\" In 2016, Israeli anthropologist of religion and fellow at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute Adam Klin-Oron said about then-proposed \"anti-cult\" legislation: \n\nIn the 1970s, the anti-cult movement applied the concept of brainwashing to explain seemingly sudden and dramatic religious conversions to various new religious movements (NRMs) and other groups they considered cults. News media reports tended to support the brainwashing view and social scientists sympathetic to the anti-cult movement, who were usually psychologists, developed revised models of mind control. While some psychologists were receptive to the concept, sociologists were for the most part skeptical of its ability to explain conversion to NRMs.\n\nPhilip Zimbardo defined mind control as, \"the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception, motivation, affect, cognition or behavioral outcomes,\" and he suggested that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation. Another adherent to this view, Jean-Marie Abgrall was heavily criticized by forensic psychologist Dick Anthony for employing a pseudo-scientific approach and lacking any evidence that anyone's worldview was substantially changed by these coercive methods. On the contrary, the concept and the fear surrounding it was used as a tool for the anti-cult movement to rationalize the persecution of minority religious groups.\n\nEileen Barker criticized the concept of mind control because it functioned to justify costly interventions such as deprogramming or exit counseling. She has also criticized some mental health professionals, including Singer, for accepting expert witness jobs in court cases involving NRMs. Her 1984 book, \"\" describes the religious conversion process to the Unification Church (whose members are sometimes informally referred to as \"Moonies\"), which had been one of the best known groups said to practice brainwashing. Barker spent close to seven years studying Unification Church members. She interviewed in depth or gave probing questionnaires to church members, ex-members, \"non-joiners,\" and control groups of uninvolved people from similar backgrounds, as well as parents, spouses, and friends of members. She also attended numerous church workshops and communal facilities. Barker writes that she rejects the \"brainwashing\" theory, because it explains neither the many people who attended a recruitment meeting and did not become members, nor the voluntary disaffiliation of members.\n\nJames Richardson observed that if the new religious movements had access to powerful brainwashing techniques, one would expect that they would have high growth rates, yet in fact most have not had notable success in recruitment. Most adherents participate for only a short time, and the success in retaining members is limited. For this and other reasons, sociologists of religion including David Bromley and Anson Shupe consider the idea that \"cults\" are brainwashing American youth to be \"implausible.\" In addition, Thomas Robbins, Massimo Introvigne, Lorne Dawson, Gordon Melton, Marc Galanter, and Saul Levine, amongst other scholars researching NRMs, have argued and established to the satisfaction of courts, relevant professional associations and scientific communities that there exists no generally accepted scientific theory, based upon methodologically sound research, that supports the concept of brainwashing as advanced by the anti-cult movement.\n\nBenjamin Zablocki responded that brainwashing is not \"a process that is directly observable,\" and that the \"real sociological issue\" is whether \"brainwashing occurs frequently enough to be considered an important social problem\", and that Richardson misunderstands brainwashing, conceiving of it as a recruiting process, instead of a retaining process, and that the number of people who attest to brainwashing in interviews (performed in accordance with guidelines of the National Institute of Mental Health and National Science Foundation) is too large result from anything other than a genuine phenomenon. Zablocki also pointed out that in the two most prestigious journals dedicated to the sociology of religion there have been no articles \"supporting the brainwashing perspective,\" while over one hundred such articles have been published in other journals \"marginal to the field.\" He concludes that the concept of brainwashing has been unfairly blacklisted.\n\nIn 1983, the American Psychological Association (APA) asked Singer to chair a taskforce called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or coercive persuasion did indeed play a role in recruitment by NRMs.\n\"Cults and large group awareness trainings have generated considerable controversy because of their widespread use of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control. These techniques can compromise individual freedom, and their use has resulted in serious harm to thousands of individuals and families. This report reviews the literature on this subject, proposes a new way of conceptualizing influence techniques, explores the ethical ramifications of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control, and makes recommendations addressing the problems described in the report.\"\nOn 11 May 1987, the APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because the report \"lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur\", and concluded that \"after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue.\"\n\nKathleen Barry, co-founder of the United Nations NGO, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW), in her 1979 book \"Female Sexual Slavery\" prompted international awareness of human sex trafficking. In his 1986 book \"Woman Abuse: Facts Replacing Myths\" Lewis Okun reported that: “Kathleen Barry shows in Female Sexual Slavery that forced female prostitution involves coercive control practices very similar to thought reform.” In their 1996 book, \"Casting Stones: Prostitution and Liberation in Asia and the United States\", Rita Nakashima Brock and Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite report that the methods commonly used by pimps to control their victims \"closely resemble the brainwashing techniques of terrorists and paranoid cults.\"\n\nSome of the techniques used by traffickers include feigning love and concern for the victims' well-being to gain trust before beginning to track, manipulate and control the entire life of the victim, including environment, relationships, access to information and daily activities, promises of lucrative employment or corrupt marriage proposals, debt bondage, kidnapping, induced drug dependency and fear tactics such as threats about law enforcement, deportation, and harm to friends or family members. Physical captivity, shame, Stockholm Syndrome, traumatic bonding and fear of arrest can contribute to victims’ inability to seek assistance.\n\nRussian historian Daniel Romanovsky, who interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses in the 1970s, reported on what he called \"Nazi brainwashing\" of the people of Belarus by the occupying Germans during the Second World War, which took place through both mass propaganda and intense re-education, especially in schools. Romanovsky noted that very soon most people had adopted the Nazi view that the Jews were an inferior race and were closely tied to the Soviet government, views that had not been at all common before the German occupation.\n\nJoost Meerloo, a Dutch psychiatrist, was an early proponent of the concept of brainwashing. (\"Menticide\" is a neologism coined by him meaning: \"killing of the mind.\") Meerloo's view was influenced by his experiences during the German occupation of his country and his work with the Dutch government and the American military in the interrogation of accused Nazi war criminals. He later emigrated to the United States and taught at Columbia University. His best-selling 1956 book, \"The Rape of the Mind\", concludes by saying: \n\nScholars have said that modern business corporations practice mind control to create a work force that shares common values and culture. Critics have linked \"corporate brainwashing\" with globalization, saying that corporations are attempting to create a worldwide monocultural network of producers, consumers, and managers. Modern educational systems have also been criticized, by both the left and the right, for contributing to corporate brainwashing. In his 1992 book, \"Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization\", Stanley A. Deetz says that modern \"self awareness\" and \"self improvement\" programs provide corporations with even more effective tools to control the minds of employees than traditional brainwashing.\n\nIn his 2000 book, \"Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism\", Robert Lifton applied his original ideas about thought reform to Aum Shinrikyo and the War on Terrorism, concluding that in this context thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion. He also pointed out that in their efforts against terrorism Western governments were also using some mind control techniques, including thought-terminating clichés.\n\nIn her 2004 popular science book, \"\", neuroscientist and physiologist Kathleen Taylor reviewed the history of mind control theories, as well as notable incidents. She suggests that persons under its influence have more rigid neurological pathways, and that can make it more difficult to rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. Reviewers praised her book for its clear presentation, while some criticized it for oversimplification.\n\n"}

Each digit can be mapped to one or more letters, creating a limited but functional subset of the alphabet, sometimes referred to as \"beghilos\" (or \"beghilosz\").\n\nThe graphic below is illustrates the term \"BEghILOSZ\" constructed from the inverted sequence \"250714638\":\n\nBEghlLOSZ =\n\nCertain calculators omit the topmost stem on the digit \"6\" and the bottom-most stem on the \"9\". In such cases, \"6\" renders a lowercase \"q\" when turned upside-down, and \"9\" appears as a lowercase \"b\".\n\nOther variants of calculator spelling alphabets consider \"0\" to be a capital \"D\" instead of \"O\", \"6\" (not used in the standard beghilos) as a lowercase \"g\" (as opposed to uppercase represented by 9) and \"9\" as either a reversed lowercase \"a\" or an at sign (@), both of which represent the letter A.\n\nExtending the available alphabet to hexadecimal notation (generally available on lower-end scientific calculators, though not on basic models), \"b\" and \"d\" correspond to \"q\" and \"p\" respectively. \"F\" transforms to a mixture between a \"J\" and a \"t\". A and C do not transform readily to recognizable letters. E transforms to 3. C transforms to an open O or right parenthesis. Upside-down A is the # sign.\n\nUsing leet, additional letters can be represented by combinations of letters (11/II or 2 [\"Z\" being very rare in English] representing \"two\" or \"to\", 111/III representing \"three\", 15/SI, 935/SEa or 335/SEE for \"C\", etc.). This is generally rare and, especially in the last case (using a spelling-out of a letter) severely limits readability.\n\nOnly certain calculators are capable of being used for beghilos calculator spelling. LCD, VFD, LED, and Panaplex displays are best for spelling words. The ability of dot-matrix displays, fourteen-segment and sixteen-segment displays to render most characters defeats the purpose of spelling with a limited alphabet.\n\nIf the calculator is instead rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from upright to create a vertical display, a different, but less useful, set of letters can be reproduced, including:\n\nIf the calculator is instead rotated 90 degrees clockwise from upright to create a vertical display, \"still\" a different, but similarly less useful, set of letters can be reproduced, including:\n\nPlacing a calculator in front of a mirror produces the following character set, including:\n\nVertical\n90° CCW\n90° CW\nUpside-down:\n\nAside from novelty and amusement, calculator spelling has limited utility. The popularity of pagers in the 1990s gave rise to a form of leetspeak called pagerspeak. Students, in particular, experimented with calculators to discover new words.\n\nThe 'original' attributed example of calculator spelling, which dates from the 1970s, is 5318008, which when turned over spells \"BOOBIES\". Another early example of calculator spelling offered the sequence 0.7734, which becomes \"hELLO\". Other words possible with the traditional \"BEghILOSZ\" set include \"LOOSE\", \"ShELL\", \"BEIgE\", \"gOBBLE\", \"gOOgLE\", and very many others. Among the longest are \"gLOSSOLOgIES\" and \"BIBLIOLOgIES\" at 12 letters, and \"hILLBILLIES\" and \"SLEIghBELLS\" at 11 (these require 12-digit displays, such as those used in adding machines). Hip hop slang applications include the sequence 3722145 which spells \"ShIZZLE\". On certain 10 digit calculators the number 5304577351 spells \"I SELL ShOES\", the number 77151345 spells \"ShE IS ILL\", or the number 7715134 spells \"hE IS ILL\". Another common number, 7734206, spells \"gO 2 hELL\". 8008 is special in that it can spell \"BOOB\" upside-down or right-side up. 71077345 spells \"SHELLOIL\", which can be separated into two individual words (\"shell\" and \"oil\").\n\nScientific calculators that feature hexadecimal readout using the letters \"A\" through \"F\" offer more flexibility. Using a scientific calculator with hex capability, the earlier \"5318008\" example can be improved with the A–F keys to spell \"B00B1E5\", without needing to rotate the display (a practice known as hexspeak).\n\nStudents often use this capability and the improved \"alpha\" feature that use the letters \"A\" through \"Z\" to write messages, separating words by using the minus sign (\"-\") or other punctuation. In the \"B00B1E5\" example above, for instance, a factorial product sign (\"!\") can be added to create \"B00B1E5!\" Most of these calculators do not use seven-segment displays, instead using dot matrix displays for greater versatility.\n\nWhen accessed through programming, calculator spelling can provide a form of textual feedback in devices with limited output ability. A programmer creates a wider set of letters, which does not require a reader to turn the device upside-down. Many consumer devices including digital cameras resort to variants of calculator spelling in order to display diagnostic or status information in non-alphanumeric displays. For example, many Minolta cameras display \"Err\" or \"HELP\" to indicate various problems.\n\n\n\n"}

It refers to the laws of the state which will be relied upon in settling disputes, and is often stated as one of the provisions in an official agreement between two parties. The term is used most frequently in contracts formed between two parties that do not reside in the same state. In such an instance, the authoring party usually includes a clause asserting that any litigation that arises involving the contract must do so under the laws of the author's home state.\n\nEstablishing which state will be the venue for litigation is an important part of any contract, and affects nearly every form of industry or commerce that transcends borders. For example, in the United States, many insurance companies choose to locate their headquarters in Iowa or Connecticut where state law is seen as favorable to their interests. This ensures that any legal action taken against the corporation will occur under friendly laws. The same phenomenon occurs in the software industry as well, with the majority of End User License Agreements including an item that establishes the laws of their home state as controlling law.\n\nControlling law can also have an effect on whether or not a lawsuit begins in the first place. When the plaintiff resides in a different state than the defendant, taking action can be extremely expensive. The costs of hiring an attorney in the area, along with the costs of travel and wages lost from appearing in court, can often discourage them from filing the lawsuit. This effectively limits the number of minor claims brought against the author of the contract, although more serious claims are often brought without regard to the expense.\n\n"}
{"id": "638633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=638633", "title": "Dictionary-based machine translation", "text": "Dictionary-based machine translation\n\nMachine translation can use a method based on dictionary entries, which means that the words will be translated as a dictionary does – word by word, usually without much correlation of meaning between them. Dictionary lookups may be done with or without morphological analysis or lemmatisation. While this approach to machine translation is probably the least sophisticated, dictionary-based machine translation is ideally suitable for the translation of long lists of phrases on the subsentential (i.e., not a full sentence) level, e.g. inventories or simple catalogs of products and services.\n\nIt can also be used to expedite manual translation, if the person carrying it out is fluent in both languages and therefore capable of correcting syntax and grammar.\n\nLMT is a Prolog-based machine-translation system that works\non specially made bilingual dictionaries, such as the Collins English-German\n(CEG), which have been rewritten in an indexed form which is easily readable by\ncomputers. This method uses a structured lexical data base (LDB) in order to\ncorrectly identify word categories from the source language, thus constructing\na coherent sentence in the target language, based on rudimentary morphological\nanalysis. This system uses \"frames\" to identify the position a certain word\nshould have, from a syntactical point of view, in a sentence. This \"frames\" are\nmapped via language conventions, such as UDICT in the case of English.\n\nIn its early (prototype) form LMT uses three lexicons,\naccessed simultaneously: source, transfer and target, although it is possible\nto encapsulate this whole information in a single lexicon. The program uses a\nlexical configuration consisting of two main elements. The first element is a\nhand-coded lexicon addendum which contains possible incorrect translations. The\nsecond element consist of various bilingual and monolingual dictionaries\nregarding the two languages which are the source and target languages.\n\nThis method of Dictionary-Based Machine translation explores\na different paradigm from systems such as LMT. An example-based machine translation system is supplied with only a \"sentence-aligned bilingual corpus\".\nUsing this data the translating program generates a \"word-for-word bilingual\ndictionary\" which is used for further translation.\n\nWhilst this system would generally be regarded as a whole\ndifferent way of machine translation than Dictionary-Based Machine Translation,\nit is important to understand the complementing nature of this paradigms. With\nthe combined power inherent in both systems, coupled with the fact that a\nDictionary-Based Machine Translation works best with a \"word-for-word bilingual\ndictionary\" lists of words it demonstrates the fact that a coupling of this two\ntranslation engines would generate a very powerful translation tool that is,\nbesides being semantically accurate, capable of enhancing its own\nfunctionalities via perpetual feedback loops.\n\nA system which combines both paradigms in a way similar to\nwhat was described in the previous paragraph is the Pangloss Example-Based\nMachine Translation engine (PanEBMT) machine translation engine. PanEBMT uses a\ncorrespondence table between languages to create its corpus. Furthermore,\nPanEBMT supports multiple incremental operations on its corpus, which facilitates\na biased translation used for filtering purposes.\n\nDouglas Hofstadter through his \"Le Ton beau de Marot: In\nPraise of the Music of Language\" proves what a complex task translation is. The\nauthor produced and analysed dozens upon dozens of possible translations for an\neighteen line French poem, thus revealing complex inner workings of syntax,\nmorphology and meaning. Unlike most translation engines who choose a single\ntranslation based on back to back comparison of the texts in both the source\nand target languages, Douglas Hofstadter’s work prove the inherent level of\nerror which is present in any form of translation, when the meaning of the\nsource text is too detailed or complex. Thus the problem of text alignment and\n\"statistics of language\" is brought to attention.\n\nThis discrepancies led to Martin Kay’s views on translation\nand translation engines as a whole. As Kay puts it \"More substantial successes\nin these enterprises will require a sharper image of the world than any that\ncan be made out simply from the statistics of language use\" [(page xvii)\nParallel Text Processing: Alignment and Use of Translation Corpora]. Thus Kay\nhas brought back to light the question of meaning inside language and the\ndistortion of meaning through processes of translation.\n\nOne of the possible uses of Dictionary-Based Machine Translation is facilitating \"Foreign Language Tutoring\" (FLT). This can be achieved by using Machine-Translation technology as well as linguistics, semantics and morphology to produce \"Large-Scale Dictionaries\" in virtually any given language. Development in lexical semantics and computational linguistics during the time period between 1990 and 1996 made it possible for \"natural language processing\" (NLP) to flourish, gaining new capabilities, nevertheless benefiting machine translation in general.\n\n\"Lexical Conceptual Structure\" (LCS) is a representation\nthat is language independent. It is mostly used in foreign language tutoring,\nespecially in the natural language processing element of FLT. LCS has also\nproved to be an indispensable tool for machine translation of any kind, such as\nDictionary-Based Machine Translation. Overall one of the primary goals of LCS\nis \"to demonstrate that synonymous verb senses share distributional patterns\".\n\n\"DKvec is a method for extracting bilingual lexicons, from\nnoisy parallel corpora based on arrival distances of words in noisy parallel\ncorpora\". This method has emerged in response to two problems plaguing the\nstatistical extraction of bilingual lexicons: \"(1) How can noisy parallel\ncorpora be used? (2) How can non-parallel yet comparable corpora be used?\"\n\nThe \"DKvec\" method has proven invaluable for machine\ntranslation in general, due to the amazing success it has had in trials\nconducted on both English – Japanese and English – Chinese noisy parallel\ncorpora. The figures for accuracy \"show a 55.35% precision from a small corpus\nand 89.93% precision from a larger corpus\". With such impressive numbers it is\nsafe to assume the immense impact that methods such as \"DKvec\" has had in the\nevolution of machine translation in general, especially Dictionary-Based\nMachine Translation.\n\nAlgorithms used for extracting parallel corpora in a\nbilingual format exploit the following rules in order to achieve a satisfactory\naccuracy and overall quality:\n\nThis methods can be used to generate, or to look for, occurrence patterns which in turn are used to produce binary occurrence vectors which are used by the \"DKvec\" method.\n\nThe history of machine translation (MT) starts around the\nmid 1940s. Machine translations was probably the first time computers were\nused for non-numerical purposes. Machine translation enjoyed a fierce research interest\nduring the 1950s and 1960s, which was followed by a stagnation until the 1980s.\nAfter the 1980s, machine translation became mainstream again, enjoying an even\nbigger popularity than in the 1950s and 1960s as well as rapid expansion,\nlargely based on the text corpora approach.\n\nThe basic concept of machine translation can be traced back\nto the 17th century in the speculations surrounding \"universal\nlanguages and mechanical dictionaries\". The first true practical machine\ntranslation suggestions were made in 1933 by Georges Artsrouni in France and Petr\nTrojanskij in Russia. Both had patented machines that they believed could be\nused for translating meaning from a language to another. \"In June 1952, the\nfirst MT conference was convened at MIT by Yehoshua Bar-Hillel\". On 7 January 1954 a Machine Translation convention in New York, sponsored by IBM,\nserved at popularizing the field. The conventions popularity came from the\ntranslation of short English sentences into Russian. This engineering feat\nmesmerised the public and the governments of both the USA and USSR who\ntherefore stimulated large-scale funding in machine translation research.\nAlthough the enthusiasm for machine translation was extremely high, technical\nand knowledge limitations led to disillusions regarding what machine\ntranslation was actually capable of doing, at least at that time. Thus machine\ntranslation lost in popularity until the 1980s, when advances in linguistics\nand technology helped revitalise the interest in this field.\n\n\"Translingual information retrieval (TLIR) consists of\nproviding a query in one language and searching document collections in one or\nmore different languages\". Most methods of TLIR can be quantified into two\ncategories, namely statistical-IR approaches and query translation. Machine\ntranslation based TLIR works in one of two ways. Either the query is translated\nin the target language, or the original query is used to search while the\ncollection of possible results is translated in the query language and used for\ncross-reference. Both methods have pros and cons, namely:\n\nAll this points prove the fact that Dictionary-Based machine translation is the most efficient and reliable form of translation when working with TLIR. This is because the process \"looks up each query term in a general-purpose bilingual dictionary, and uses all its possible translations.\"\n\nThe examples of RUSLAN, a dictionary-based machine\ntranslation system between Czech and Russian and CESILKO, a Czech – Slovak\ndictionary-based machine translation system, shows that in the case of very\nclose languages simpler translation methods are more efficient, fast and\nreliable.\n\nThe RUSLAN system was made in order to prove the hypotheses\nthat related languages are easier to translate. The system development started\nin 1985 and was terminated five years later due to lack of further funding. The\nlessons taught by the RUSLAN experiment are that a transfer-based approach of\ntranslation retains its quality regardless of how close the languages are. The\nmain two bottlenecks of \"full-fledged transfer-based systems\" are complexity\nand unreliability of syntactic analysis.\n\n\"Information Retrieval systems rank documents according to\nstatistical similarity measures based on the co-occurrence of terms in queries\nand documents\". The MLIR system was created and optimised in such a way that\nfacilitates dictionary based translation of queries. This is because of the\nfact that queries tend to be short, a couple of words, which, despite not\nproviding a lot of context it is a more feasible than translating whole\ndocuments, due to practical reasons. Despite all this, the MLIR system is\nhighly dependent on a lot of resources such as automated language detection\nsoftware.\n\nLinguistics (lin·guis·tics | lĭng-gwĭs′tĭks) = \"n.\" \"(used with a sing. verb)\" The study of the nature, structure, and variation of language, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, socio-linguistics, and pragmatics.\n\ncomputational linguistics = The branch of linguistics in which the techniques of computer science are applied to the analysis and synthesis of language and speech.\n\nSyntax (sin-taks) noun = a. the study of the rules for the formation of grammatical sentences in a language; b. the study of the patterns of formation of sentences and phrases from words; c. the rules or patterns so studied; \"Computers.\" the grammatical rules and structural patterns governing the ordered use of appropriate words and symbols for issuing commands, writing code, etc., in a particular software application or programming language.\n\n"}

However, it never became law. It tried to amend Federal law to declare English to be the official language of the U.S. Government. If it became a law, it would have required state representatives to conduct official business in English. It would have required that all officials conduct naturalization ceremonies entirely in English as well.\nConservative Republican lawmaker Representative Steve King introduced this act to the House of Representatives on March 1, 2005 it was known as the English Language Unity Act of 2005. Before the 109th session ended of congress, the bill accumulated 164 sponsors. The last action on this bill was the introductory remarks on the proposed bill on May 19, 2006. The bill did not come up for debate during this session of Congress, so it is said to have died.\n\nRepresentative King reintroduced the bill as the English Unity Act of 2007 on February 12, 2007. This time it gained the support of 153 cosponsors. The last action on this proposed bill was on June 5, 2007 when the House Committee on Education and Labor referred the bill to the subcommittee on Early Childhood Education, Elementary and Secondary Education. Congress adjourned before further action could be taken, so the bill died again in 2007.\n\nRepresentative King alongside Senator Jim Inhofe introduced the English Language Unity Act of 2011 on Friday, March 10, 2011. In a release King defended his proposition by saying \"A common language is the most powerful unifying force known throughout history. We need to encourage assimilation of all legal immigrants in each generation. A nation divided by language cannot pull together as effectively as a people.\" Inhofe added: \"This legislation will provide much-needed commonality among United States citizens, regardless of heritage. As a nation built by immigrants, it is important that we share one vision and one official language.\" \n\nRepeated attempts to make English the official language of the United States have failed time and time again, though the issue never fails to spark heated debate. While appearing to focus solely on language, these attempt trigger issues related to financial burden, discrimination, patriotism, and unity.\n\nThose against the legislation argue the bill deals with a non-issue. They claim Congress does not need to establish legislation in order to teach others the importance of knowing English since the language is already spoken by a majority of Americans. Opponents of the legislation question why there is a sudden need for an official language, given that the United States government has flourished without one for the past two hundred years. They argue that it is not an official language that binds Americans together as a country, but rather the freedoms and ideals that are enjoyed by its citizens. \n\nSome opponents of the bill also argue that the legislation is unconstitutional. They assert it would limit the government's ability to correspond with all its citizens, and that by restricting federal and state employees from communicating with citizens in a language other than English, the bill violates first amendment rights of free speech. Some further contend that the bill would call for changes to the Voting Rights Act by eliminating all non- English ballots, despite the fact that nothing in the bill's language modifies the Voting Rights Act.\n\nSupporters of the legislation take the position that accommodation of non-English speakers discourages assimilation. They acknowledge that the ability to speak a language other than English is valuable, and that its use in the home, church or private place of business should in no way be discouraged. At the same time, they argue that the government should not bear the responsibility of guaranteeing that non-English-speaking individuals can participate in government solely using their mother language. They contend that as more immigrants learn English, the language barriers that divide the country into separate groups will disintegrate and lead to a decrease in racial and ethnic problems. They also believe that by learning English, individuals can become more productive citizens and members of American society. They argue that immigrants who are fluent in English have better economic opportunities, and assert that non-English speakers tend to find themselves restricted to low-skilled, low-paying jobs. Supporters of the bill also posit that the ability of immigrant groups to speak English will give them an increased political voice and allow them to participate more fully and effectively in the democratic process.\nThirty - one states currently have adopted legislation similar to the English Language Unity Act. Alabama (1990) Alaska (1998) Arizona (2006) Arkansas (1987) California (1986) Colorado (1988) Florida (1988) Georgia (1986 & 1996) Hawaii (1978) Idaho (2007) Illinois (1969) Indiana (1984) Iowa (2002) Kansas (2007) Kentucky (1984) Louisiana (1812) Massachusetts (1975) Mississippi (1987) Missouri (1998 & 2008) Montana (1995) Nebraska (1920) New Hampshire (1995) North Carolina (1987) North Dakota (1987) Oklahoma (2010) South Carolina (1987) South Dakota (1995) Tennessee (1984) Utah (2000) Virginia (1981 & 1996) Wyoming (1996).\n"}

{"id": "2342130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2342130", "title": "Hanamichi", "text": "Hanamichi\n\nThe is an extra stage section used in Japanese kabuki theater. It is a long, raised platform that runs, left of center, from the back of the theater, through the audience, to connect with the main stage. Generally it is used for characters' entrances and exits, though it can also be used for asides or scenes taking place apart from the main action. In this use, it can be seen as an alley theater connecting to a larger stage.\n\nThe \"hanamichi\" was first used in 1668 in the Kawarazaki-za, in the form of a simple wooden plank that reached from the center of the stage to the middle of the theater. It was not used in performances, but allowed actors to step into the audience after a performance to receive flowers. The word \"hanamichi\" literally means \"flower path.\"\n\nThe modern style of \"hanamichi\", sometimes called \"honhanamichi\" (, \"main flower path\"), was first conceived and standardized in 1740. The standard size ranges from 16.38 m – 18.20 m (53 ft, 9 in – 59 ft, 8 in) long and 150–180 cm (4 ft, 11 in – 5 ft, 11 in) wide. Some theaters have since begun to make use of a secondary \"hanamichi\" on the right side of the audience, known as \"karihanamichi\" (, \"copied flower path\") which is one-third to half the width of the \"honhanamichi\" on the left.\n\nThough it is rarely used for the main action of a play, much of the more dramatic or famous character moments occur during entrances or exits along the \"hanamichi\". Many particularly dramatic actions take place seven-tenths of the way down the \"hanamichi\" (three-tenths away from the stage), at a spot known in Japanese as \"shichisan\" (, seven-three). It is here that exiting characters may say their final words, and entering characters may address the audience or the characters on stage. Since the \"hanamichi\" runs through the audience, it allows for a closer experience for the spectator than might normally be allowed by other forms of traditional theater.\n\nIn sumo, the path to the \"dohyō\" is also called \"hanamichi\".\n\n\n"}

Cinco de Mayo celebrates the defeat of the French Army by Mexican soldiers at the Battle of Puebla though some people believe it is the Mexican day of independence.\n\nUkraine is among the countries that have issued a stamp commemorating Easter, a Christian holiday.\n\nThe United States Postal Service issued a 34 cent stamp on the 1 September 2001 at the annual Islamic Society of North America's convention in Des Plaines, Illinois. It features gold Arabic calligraphy on a lapis background that commemorates two of the most important Muslim festivals: Eid ul-Fitr, marking the end of the month-long fast of Ramadan and Eid al-Adha, at the end of the pilgrimage to Mecca. During the festival, Muslims wish each other \"Eid mubarak,\" the phrase featured on the stamp. \"Eid Mubarak\" translates into English as \"blessed festival,\" and can be paraphrased as \"May your religious holiday be blessed.\" This phrase can be applied to both Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. This stamp was designed by the Islamic calligrapher Mohammed Zakariya.\n\nOn 12 August 2011, a new version of the Eid stamp, a Forever stamp for first class mail, was issued. With a red background, its calligraphy (i.e., text) is distinctly different from the 2001 stamp with blue background. On the Forever stamp, the text in the upper left corner is \"2011 USA\", and text in upper right, running vertically, reads \"FOREVER.\" Text running across bottom reads \"EID GREETINGS.\"\n\nPakistan is among the other countries with an Eid stamp.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service issued a 32 cent stamp on October 22, 1996 as a joint issue with Israel. Hanukkah commemorates the revolt led by Judah Maccabee against the government of Antiochus IV in 165 BC. This initial printing produced 103.5 million stamps and in it was re-issued in 1999 in a 33 cent value.\n\nThe Israeli stamp employs the same multi-colored menorah design, by American Hannah Smotrich, a graduate of the Yale School of Art. Israel also issued a first day cover as well as a souvenir sheet, which shows both stamps (pictured on left). As a unique feature, this was this first self-adhesive stamp in Israel.\n\nIn 2004, the U.S. issued another hanukkah stamp depicting a photograph of a dreidel (a spinning toy with four sides), with the word 'Hanukkah' in the background. The dreidel shown was purchased in Jerusalem by an American couple. The stamp was first issued on October 15 in New York. The initial version of the stamp has been reissued; in 2006 it was 39 cents, in 2007, it was 41 cents stamp, and in 2008 it was a 42 cent stamp.\n\nIn 2013 United States Postal Service issued a new version of Hanukkah stamp which depicted menorah again. The stamp was issued on November 19 in New York.\n\nMany countries issue stamps to celebrate their Independence Day or Republic Day.\n\nIndia celebrates its Independence on August 15, beginning with its first three stamps issued in 1947. Republic Day is celebrated on January 26, commencing with the four stamps issued in 1950.\n\nPakistan celebrates its Independence (Yaum e Azadi) on August 14, beginning with its first recess printed stamps.\n\nKwanzaa is a non-religious African-American festival which synthesizes and reinvents traditional African \"first fruits\" celebrations. The U.S. Postal Service issued the first 32 cent stamp designed by self-taught artist Synthia Saint James for Kwanzaa on October 22, 1997. This design was revalued three times to 33-cent, 34-cent and 37-cent in 1999, 2001 and 2002, respectively. A total of 133 million Kwanzaa stamps were produced in 1997. A second Kwanzaa stamp, a 37-cent self-adhesive value, was introduced on October 16, 2004 with a new design by Daniel Minter that was intended to convey \"balanced formality with a celebratory, festive mood.\" This stamp has been reissued; the 2006 was 39 cents, the 2007 value was 41 cents, the 2008 was 42 cents.\n\nIsrael has issued its \"festival\" series of stamps every year to commemorate the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah. In 1948, Israel's first festival stamps were designed by Otte Wallish and depicted LMLK seals stamped onto jars from the time of King Hezekiah (circa 700 BCE). The Rosh Hashanah stamps often display secular and patriotic motifs, such as bread, wine, olives, soldiers, kibbutzniks, Israeli dancing and the national library (1992). Fittingly, many series feature religious motifs, such as curtains for synagogue arks (1999), Hebrew Bible stories (1994), ushpizin of Sukkot (1997), Jewish lifecycle events (1995), and the orders the Mishnah 92006), with Nezikin pictured here.\n\nSeveral countries have issued love stamps for Saint Valentine's Day, such as; Belgium, France, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Collectors will often try to collect covers from romantically named towns. Perhaps the most well known, servicing more than 200,000 each year around Valentine's Day, is Loveland, USA.\n\nIn 1985 An Post, the Irish Post Office, started issuing Love stamps for use on Saint Valentine's Day cards. The first pair of stamps issued depicted clouds and balloon (22p value) and hearts and flowers (26p value). An Post continues to issue new designs each year.\nSeveral nations issue postage stamps to mark the Chinese New Year (or Lunar New Year). Typically appearing in January and February, issuing countries have included China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, United States, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and France.\n\nThe stamps usually depict the animal sign of that year, consisting of the sequence: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. The designs may be part of a set, or individually designed; for instance, since 1992 the US has been issuing Chinese New Year stamps using a common design type based on colored paper cutouts of the animals. In succeeding years, the U.S. Postal Service issued additional stamps until all twelve animals associated with the Chinese lunar calendar were represented. The calligraphic characters on these stamps may be translated into English as \"Happy New Year\".\n\nHong Kong was one of the first countries to issue a commemorative stamp for the lunar new year since the 1960s (1967), but other countries have followed:\n\n\nMost of these stamps consist of first day covers, commemorative sheets and multiple country brochures.\n\n\n"}

() is a book by Ukrainian writer and social activist Ivan Dziuba, written in September-December 1965.\n\nThe immediate impetus for writing this work were political repressions that took place in Ukrainian SSR in 1965 against the Ukrainian intellectuals. In August and September 1965 in Kiev, Lviv, Lutsk, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil about three dozen of young Ukrainian intellectuals were arrested. On September 4 in Kiev during the premiere of the Sergei Parajanov's movie \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\" poets Vasyl Stus and Ivan Dziuba called for protesting against political repression.\n\nIn the work \"Internationalism or Russification?\", written under the influence of those events, Dziuba analyzed from a Marxist position the national and cultural policy of the Soviet Union in Ukraine. The author sent his work to the first Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, Petro Shelest, and to the Head of the Ukrainian SSR government, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, and its Russian translation - to the leadership of Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).\n\nIn \"Internationalism or Russification?\" Dziuba argued that during Joseph Stalin's rule the CPSU had moved to the positions of Russian chauvinism. His argumentation the author built largely on quotations from the works of Vladimir Lenin and party documents of the 1920s. He believed that the policy of the CPSU, particularly in Ukraine, contradicts with the fundamental interests of the Ukrainian people and contended that the solution is in returning to Lenin's principles of national policy.\n\nThe work \"Internationalism or Russification?\" spread in the \"samizdat\", and in February, 1968 it was published in the magazine \"The Contemporary\" (Сучасність).\nWithout permission and knowledge of the author the book was repeatedly issued outside of the Soviet Union in Ukrainian, English, Russian, Chinese French and Italian languages. In Ukraine, this work was legally published only in 1990 in the magazine \"Motherland\" (Вітчизна), and as a book it was first published in 1998.\n\nThe Soviet government announced \"Internationalism or Russification?\" as an Anti-Soviet work, and its distribution, storage or even just reading - as a crime. Dziuba lost his job, he was expelled from the Writers' Union of Ukraine and faced harassment from the KGB, and in 1972 was jailed for 18 months.\n\n\n"}

He is mostly known for his poems depicting his own pathos.\n\nHe lived in Lathi-Gohilwad, which is located in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat.\n\nSursinhji was born to the royal family of Lathi in 1874. His mother's name was Ramba. He had a very short life of 26 years, and died in 1900. He was educated at Rajkumar College, Rajkot. He was married to two princesses. Rajba-Ramaba, the princess of Kutch - Roha, and Kesharba-Anandiba, the Princess of Saurashtra-Kotada at the age of 15. Ramaba was elder to Sursinhji by eight years, while Anandiba was elder to him by two years. When he was 20 years old, he fell in love with Shobhana, who was serving as a maid to his royal family.\n\nIt is believed that Kalapi's love for Shobhana became the reason of conflicts with Ramaba, and then the reason for his accidental death due to poisoning by his own wife.\n\nIn spite of his short life, poet Kalapi's creation was immense and enormous. His creation includes about 250 poems (including 15,000 verses). He has also given a number of prose writings. His 900 letters to his friends and wives brought the facts and truth. He not only used Gujarati language as his medium to elaborate his own creation, but also translated four English novels in Gujarati.\n\nIn his relatively short life, he still managed to mentor a minor number of budding poets, who carried on his style of writing, becoming very famous in their own right. The most prominent among these was Kavi Lalitji, who was about the same age as Kalapi, and already an established poet, when he was invited to the Lathi Darbar as a tutor for the Royal children. He came under Kalapi's influence, the two became great friends, and Kavi Lalitji went on to become the Rajya Kavi (Royal Bard) of Lathi.\n\nAll of Kalapi's creations, reading, study and achievements were packed by Kavi Lalitji during the period of his age from 16 years to 26 years.\n\nKavi Kalapi had written poems in various Chhand of Gujarati language. Like Mandakranta, Shardulvikridit, Shikharini etc. To write poem in particular Chhand, one has to follow the structure of that chhand and the rules of chhandas poem. Kavi kalapi is the only poet who has written maximum number of poems in these chhands. \"Aapni Yadi\" is one of his best known ghazal in Gujarati literature.\n\nToday, a museum has been set up in the present Lathi town, where visitors can gather more information about Kavi Kalapi's life and the history of Gohilwad Kingdom.\n\nIn his remembrance, the Indian National Theater, Mumbai gives Kalapi Award to the established Gujarati ghazal poet annually since 1997.\n\nThe 1966 Gujarati film, titled \"Kalapi\" is based on his life, with Sanjeev Kumar playing the titular role, and Padmarani playing the role of his wife, Rama.

{"id": "2251097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251097", "title": "Kapingamarangi language", "text": "Kapingamarangi language\n\nKapingamarangi is a Polynesian language spoken in the Federated States of Micronesia. It had 3,000 native speakers in 1995. The language is closely related to the Nukuoro language.\n\nThe Kapingamarangi language is a language spoken in the Pacific by people from Kapingamarangi, the Pohnpei Island, and in the Pohnrakied village in Pohnpei. Kapingamarangi was first recorded on an expedition in 1557 by Spanish navigator Hernando de Grigalvan (Elbert, 1946). Kapingamarangi, also known as Kirinit, is categorized in the Austronesian language family, along with many other Pacific languages. Kapingamarangi is an atoll, which is located in the state of Pohnpei of the Federated States of Micronesia. In the country of Pohnpei, Kapingamarangi is the southernmost atoll of the country and of the Caroline Islands. The total area of the Kapingamarangi Island is . The western reef rim of the islands gets almost submerged in water when the tides are high. The Kapingamarangi language is spoken not only on the atoll of Kapingamarangi, but also in the village of Pohnrakied, located on the island of Pohnpei. Pohnpei is the largest, highest, most populated, and the most developed island in the Federated States of Micronesia. It is also part of the Caroline Islands group. The island of Pohnpei is administered under the Federated States of Micronesia government.\n\nKapingamarangi is viewed as another world, even to other cultures located inside of Micronesia. The people of Kapingamarangi live in towns, rather than being scattered out in little hamlets like other additional places located in Micronesia (Elbert, 1946). Kapingamarangi currently has three thousand total speakers: one thousand speakers on the atoll of Kapingamarangi and two thousand speakers in Pohnrakied village on Pohnpei. The people of Kapingamarangi are considered to be of Polynesian ethnicity; the other seven states of the Federated States of Micronesia are categorized as being Micronesian. The only language that is recognized as an official language in Micronesia is English. The language status of Kapingamarangi is \"educational\", which means that the language is in vigorous use, maintaining standardization and literature throughout a widespread system in institutions of education. The language has been developed to a point that it is used and sustained in people's homes and around the community.\n\nA, B, D, E, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Ng, O, P, T, U, W\n\nLong vowels are written with double vowels (Leiber & Dikepa, 1974).\n\nKapingamarangi has 18 consonants /p, pʰ, t, tʰ, k, kʰ, w, wʰ, h, hː, m, mʰ, n, nʰ, ŋ, ŋʰ, ɺ, ɺʰ/ (Leiber & Dikepa, 1974).\n\nThe main vowels in Kapingamarangi are /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/ (Leiber & Dikepa, 1974). In the Kapingamarangi language, the vowels can be described as long or short vowels. A long vowel means that the vowel sound is stressed more in a word when spoken. The long vowels are written by writing two of the same letters next to each other. Therefore, the Kapingamarangi language is composed of ten vowels (Lieber & Dikepa, 1974).\n\nex. ʻʻduliʻʻ bird\nʻʻduliiʻʻ small, little\n\nKapingamarangi vowel phonemes have diphthongs because in Kapingamarangi language, it is possible to have any two vowels next to each other. For example, the word \"eidu\" which means \"spirit\" has a diphthong with the letters /e/ and /i/ (Lieber & Dikepa, 1974).\n\nThe syllable structure of the Kapingamarangi language is VV, VVV, VCV, CVV, CCVV, CVCV, and CCVCV (Lieber & Dikepa, 1974). In Kapingamarangi, like most Polynesian languages, it is impossible for a word to end in a consonant, but it is possible for there to be two consonants together, as long as it is the same letter.\n\nExample: The term for un-groomed hair is \"libgo wwana\". In this term, the two (W’s) stand together in the word \"wwana\".\n\nThere are three possible word orders in the Kapingamarangi language. The word order of Kapingamarangi is SVO (subject–verb–object), VSO (Verb Subject Object), or OSV (Object Verb Subject), (Elberts, 1948). SVO is the commonly used word order, followed by VSO, and finally OSV is the least used and is a very case in the language. The word order for questions is the same as they are for statements. In research for the grammar of Kapingamarangi, deciphering reasoning or specific uses for the alternative word orders are unsure.\n\nex. Mee gu noho I dono hale.\n\nMorphology is another pivotal element to understanding the grammar of Kapingamarangi. Morphology is the descriptive analysis of words (Elbert, 1948). The morphology of Kapingamarangi is extremely extensive. The word classes in Kapingamarangi are pronouns, possessives, demonstratives, verbs, nouns, adverbs, adjectives, negatives, particles, conjunctions, and interjections (Elbert, 1948).\n\nMany verbs can take a prefix, but even more verbs take a suffix. For example, a verb may have a prefix like \"haka-\" before a word, and a suffix like \"–ina\" after a word. Like the English language, adjectives follow nouns, and adverbs follow verbs, adjectives, and/or demonstratives. Negatives in Kapingamarangi immediately precede verbs or verb particles (Elbert, 1948). Conjunctions mark serial relationships, and interjections denote emotion (Elbert, 1948).\n\nThe pronouns in Kapingamarangi can be dual (two people), plural (more than two people), inclusive (including the addressee), or exclusive (excluding the addressee). Serial relationships are expressed by the pronoun \"mo\", which means \"and\" (Elbert, 1948). For example, \"David and I\" would be, \"Kimaua mo David\". The pronouns in the Kapingamarangi language are very different from the pronouns in the English language. The pronouns in Kapingamarangi are not gender specific. For example, \"Kinae\" means \"him or her\"; therefore the gender must be translated through the context of a sentence or conversation.\n\nReduplication is a common concept that appears in the Kapingamarangi language, and is relevant to understanding the grammar of Kapingamarangi. Reduplication is the repetition of a root word (Elbert, 1948). The reduplication of Kapingamarangi can be achieved in two different fashions: partial and full reduplication. The fully reduplicated form is generated by the full repetition of the base form, while partial reduplication is generated by partial repetition of the base form (Lieber & Dikepa, 1974). Reduplication usually depicts continued or repeated action (Elbert, 1948). For example, \"tapa\" is a single flash of lightning, while \"tapatapa\" is repeated flashing. In Kapingamarangi, reduplication can be done with the first two syllables, or it can be done with the final two syllables. There is only one word in the lexicon of Kapingamarangi that displays a partially reduplicated form; the word \"baba\" is the only word that is partially reduplicated, and it reduplicates to the word \"babaa\" (Lieber & Dikepa, 1974).\n\nExamples:\n\n\nThe Kapingamarangi language has an influence of English in their community, because English is the official language of the Federated States of Micronesia. Words from the English vocabulary were borrowed and transfigured into the Kapingamarangi lexicon.\n\nWords derived from English:\n\nFrom Leiber and Dikepa, 1974\n\ngada\n\nduu\n\nKapingamarangi has access to many different materials. One of the materials that the Kapingamarangi language has access to is an online talking dictionary. It is a dictionary where one can enter a word in English and it will automatically translate it to Kapingamarangi. Many words in this dictionary also have a vocal response on how to pronounce the word, which is why it is called a talking dictionary. This is a resource because it not only provides visual correlations between the English and Kapinga translation for a word, but it also has vocal responses so that scholars of Kapingamarangi can hear a word and how to correctly pronounce it.\n\nKapingamarangi also has access to a variety of books, including dictionaries, books that contain linguistic information, and even books about the atoll of Kapingamarangi. Many native speakers were involved in the translation project that resulted in the Kapingamarangi Bible. These are resources because they are full of information and are highly reliable. Websites like Facebook and YouTube also contain information on Kapingamarangi. The Facebook page is a Micronesia Language Revitalization Workshop page and it contains information about a workshop that was held all throughout Micronesia, including Kapingamarangi. There is a YouTube video of an interview with a speaker who is bilingual in both English and Kapinga and he explains the importance of speaking Kapingamarangi and language revitalization (Heinrich, 2013). There are also selections of poetry in Kapingamarangi (Lewis, Simmons, and Charles, 2013).\n\n, it is likely that Kapingamarangi is being transmitted to children, because Kapingamarangi is in , and the number of speakers keeps increasing. Since the language is taught in schools, it is safe to assume that language is being passed down to the next generation. Since Kapingamarangi has so many resources for people to go to, children have access to a variety of resources to assist their education of the language. Kapingamarangi is not endangered, however it is threatened. The language is taught in schools and churches, but is not used in all domains. According to Ethnologue, Kapingamarangi is taught in primary schools. It is also used at home, in the community, and in churches (Lewis, Simmons, and Charles, 2013). The language is at a current growing state, and might become a language in the near future.\n\n\n\n"}

They are often located in affluent suburban areas.\n\nThe proliferation of lifestyle centers in the United States accelerated in the 2000s, with number going from 30 in 2002 to 120 at the end of 2004. Lifestyle centers are sometimes depicted as occupying the upscale end of the spectrum of commercial development, opposite to the outlet mall which typically caters with marked down prices.\n\nLifestyle centers typically require less land and may generate higher revenue margins, generating close to 500 dollars per square foot, compared to an average of 330 dollars per square foot for a traditional mall, according to the president of Poag and McEwen. Other advantages lifestyle centers have over traditional enclosed malls are savings on heating and cooling and quicker access for customers. Lifestyle centers typically look like strip shopping centers turned outside in, and the formal storefronts don't face parking areas like in strip centers, but landscaped park-like pedestrian areas, with storefronts facing each other across the pedestrian walkway or a low volume parkingless two-lane road. A two-lane road might go through the inside of the center.

Unless closing (or \"settlement\" or \"close of escrow\", as it is known in some parts of the country) is a condition of the listing agreement, the buyer's failure to complete the transaction may not require the seller to pay a commission to the broker.\n\nThe commission is usually a percentage of the sales price of the property ranging from 2 or 3% up to about 10%, but usually in the range of about 3 - 7% for houses. The commission could also be a flat fee or some combination of flat fee and percentage, based on the rate you negotiate. Commission rates and fees are negotiable and not regulated. The average days to sale in your market, advertising, labor costs, length of term, and competition may influence the rate acceptable by the listing real estate broker before entering a listing agreement.\n\nThe commission is paid by the seller to the listing real estate broker, who will then compensate their listing agent and any co-operating brokers/agents from this commission by separate agreements with them.\n\nThe listing contract typically also includes a listing price for the property and a date of expiration by which the contract expires. However, if the property is sold at a lower or higher price, the seller pays a commission at a proportionally lower or higher amount. If the seller does not accept a price lower than the listing price, then the broker will have to wait until a satisfactory sale to earn the commission.\n\nIn the event of multiple offers being presented, the seller may accept whichever offer is most suitable to him/her, even if the price is not the highest. The percentage commission will be paid according to the accepted price. The seller, often in concurrence with the real estate agent, may choose to accept an offer that is lower than the highest offer for various reasons, such as terms or contingencies in the purchase contract offered or perceived differences in financial qualification of the competing buyers.\n\nTypically, the real estate agent has the experience and data to determine a suitable listing price for the seller's property and will recommend a listing price to the seller. The seller can accept, reject, or try to negotiate a different listing price for the contract. If the seller's price is unrealistically high and the agent cannot convince the seller otherwise, the agent can decline to list the property.\n\nListing a property commonly incurs certain expenses for the listing broker and takes some time and effort for the listing salesperson. To make it worthwhile, they want a certain minimum listing time period to have a good chance of selling the property. However, the listing contract must have an expiration date. A typical listing period is often three to six months. If the property is not sold or under a purchase contract by then, the seller may decide to re-list the property, perhaps with a different listing price, with the same or a different broker or agent, or not list it at all. The listing of the property can start at a date later than the date the listing contract is signed to allow the seller time to prepare the property for showing or sale.\n\nThere can be several types of listing contracts:\n\n\n\n"}

He also is known to have used the pen names \"Madiyar\" and \"Arghyn\".\n\nDulatuli was born on November 25, 1885 in the village of Sarikopa, Kostanay Province. He was from Middle jüz, Argin tribe. He lost his mother, Demesh, at the age of two and his father, Dulat, at the age of 12. He received early education in the traditional village school. In 1897, Dulatuli enrolled in a Kazakh-Russian high school and graduated in 1902 as a village teacher. In 1904, he joined Akhmet Baytursinuli and Alikhan Bokeikhanov in Karkaraly. Under the influence of these two leaders of emerging Kazakh reformist nationalist movement, he developed an anti-colonial, anti-Russian worldview.\n\nHe moved to St. Petersburg in 1907 as a delegate of Kazakh Constitutional Democratic Party. In St. Petersburg, he published his first poem in the Kazakh journal \"Serke\", which ran only one issue. The poem was entitled \"Jastarga\" (\"to the Youth\"). He contributed another article, \"Bizdin Maksatimiz\" (\"Our Objective\"), to the second issue of the journal, which was never published.\n\nMirjaqip's political formation was greatly maturated when he published his first poetry book, \"Oyan! Qazaq,\" \"Wake up! Kazakh\" in 1909. The book was immediately confiscated. He republished \"Oyan! Qazaq\" in 1911 and returned to the Turgay oblast after the publication of the book.\n\nMeanwhile, Dulatuli published his first novel \"Baqitsiz Jamal,\" \"Jamal the Unfortunate\" in 1910. Baqitsiz Jamal has been the first novel in the contemporary Kazakh literature. The book narrates the story of oppressed Kazakh women.\n\nThus, in early 1910s, Dulatuli emerges as a leader of emerging Kazakh reformism and nationalist movement. His publications puts him under Russian surveillance, investigations and intimidations. Under Tsarist Russian surveillance, Dulatuli could not have a steady job or settle down in a town for a long time. He was arrested in Semey in 1911 and served one and half years prison term.\n\nAfter his release, Dulatuli regularly contributed to Kazakh language journals Ayqap and Qazaq until 1918 when \"Qazaq\" was closed by the Kerensky government. In his essays and poems Dulatuli criticized socio-economic, political conditions of Kazakhs under imperial administration. He also published another poetry, \"Azamat,\" \"Citizen\" in 1913.\n\nDulatuli was one of the leaders of Alash Orda Government which was formed to promote Kazakh autonomy under the Menshevik government. Alash leaders, including Baytursunov and Dulatuli, aligned with the Whites, declared independence of Kazakhstan and fought against Bolsheviks between December 1917-May 1919. When the leader of the Whites, Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, turned down requests of Alash leaders for help, the Kazakh nationalists realigned with the Bolsheviks expecting autonomy under Bolshevik government. In 1920, autonomous socialist republic was established and Alash leaders participated in local government.\n\nDulatuli worked as an editor and teacher under Bolshevik government. In 1928, he was arrested on nationalism charges and died in Solovki labour camp in 1935.\n\nDulatuli was rehabilitated post-humously in 1988. He is considered to be one of the pioneers of modern Kazakh literature, and a leader of Kazakh nationalism.\n\nThe first novel in Kazakh literature is \"Miserable Jamal\" (\"Бақытсыз Жамал\"). The author describes Jamal, a Kazakh girl, who becomes a victim of patriarchal- feudal traditions and customs, and exposing the fight between old traditions and new generation on this basis. The novel is celebrated for clear depiction of a feeling of equality, among rising young people of that time.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2216951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2216951", "title": "Nganasan language", "text": "Nganasan language\n\nThe Nganasan language (formerly called , \"tavgiysky\", or , \"tavgiysko-samoyedsky\" in Russian; from the ethnonym , \"tavgi\") is a moribund Samoyedic language spoken by the Nganasan people. In 2010 it was spoken by only 120 out of 860 Nganasan people in the southwestern and central parts of the Taymyr Peninsula.\n\nNganasan is the most divergent language of the Samoyedic branch of the Uralic language family (Janhunen 1998). There are two main dialects, Avam (, \"avamsky govor\") and Vadeyev (). Vocabulary can be traced to elements of the unknown substrate origin.\n\nThe language has 10 vowels and about 20 consonant phonemes.\n\nSeveral bisyllabic sequences of vowels are possible:\n\nOne of the main features of Nganasan is consonant gradation, which concerns the consonant phonemes and their nasal combinations .\nThe language's Cyrillic-based alphabet was devised in the 1990s:\n\nNouns in Nganasan have the grammatical categories of number (singular, dual, plural), case (nominative, genitive, accusative, lative, locative, elative, prolative, comitative) and possessivity (non-possessive versus possessive forms). Nganasan lacks determiners; however, the possessive forms of second person singular and third person singular can be used to express definiteness (Katzschmann, 2008).\n\nNganasan has personal, demonstrative, interrogative, negative and determinative pronouns. Personal pronouns are not inflected: their grammatical case forms coincide and their local case forms are expressed by the corresponding possessed forms of the postposition na-. Other pronouns are inflected like nouns (Helimski, 1998).\n\nVerbs agree with their subjects in person and number, and have three conjugation types. Like other Samoyedic languages, Nganasan has the opposition of perfective and imperfective verbs.\n\nThe subjective conjugation is used when there is no object or the object is focused. The objective conjugation is used with transitive words. The reflexive conjugation is used for some intransitive verbs. Each conjugation type has its own personal endings. There are three subtypes of objective conjugation endings that correspond to object number. \n\nNganasan has a broad mood paradigm with nine forms: indicative, imperative, interrogative, inferential, renarratve, irrealis, optative, admissive-cohortive, debitive, abessive and prohibitive. Mood forms are mostly built with the help of affixation but special particles are also sometimes used. All mood forms, except the imperative, have the same personal suffixes. Tenses are distinguished in the indicative, imperative and interrogative moods (Tereščenko, 1979).\n\nMost corresponding imperfective and perfective stems have the same root, but in rare cases the roots can be different. The aspectual opposition between imperfective and perfective verbs remains semantic in most verbal forms. However, in the indicative mood it is used to express present continuous and present perfect meanings, respectively. In this case, the opposition is present formally: imperfective verbs take imperfective suffixes and the perfective ones have the perfective suffixes (Helimski, 1998). Imperfective verbs can also express future meanings. These forms are not considered tense in the strict tense. The proper tense forms of past and future include past, past perfect, future, future-in-the past (Katzschmann, 2008).\n\nThe dominating word order in Nganasan is SOV, similar to other Samoyedic languages. However, Nganasan is considered to exhibit more freedom in word order than other languages of its group. According to Tereščenko (1979), other types of word orders are used for shifting the sentence focus, especially in emphatic speech. The focused constituent usually immediately precedes the verb. Wagner-Nagy (2010) suggests that Nganasan is similar to Hungarian in its behavior, in that its word order is determined by pragmatic factors rather than being fixed.\n\nOn the phrase level, the attributes within the noun phrase usually precede the noun and become focused when placed after it. Numerals and adjectives agree with the heads in case, and adjectives also agree with the head in number. The case agreement is only complete in grammatical cases; in locative cases the attribute gets genitive form. There are no prepositions in Nganasan, postpositions are composite parts of words and also require the attributes in genitive cases. Possession is expressed with genitive construction or by a possessive suffix attached to the possessed (Helimski, 1998; Katzschmann, 2008).\n\nNganasan is a pro-drop language: pronominal subjects are often omitted when the verb conjugation type is subjective (Tereščenko, 1979).\n\nStandard negation is expressed by negative auxiliary (ńi-) followed by the main verb in connegative form marked with ʔ, e.g. ńi-ndɨ-m konɨʔ \"I do not go\". All inflectional markers are taken by the negation auxiliary (Gusev, 2015). Objects in the form of personal, negative or demonastrative pronouns can be inserted between the negative auxiliary and the main verb (Wagner-Nagy, 2011). There are a few negative verbs other than ni-, such as kasa — \"nearly\", ləði — \"vainly\", əku — \"maybe\", and ŋuəli — \"of course\", but their functionality is restricted, with only ni- having a full paradigm.\n\nExistential sentences are negated with the negative existential predicate d'aŋku or its derivative stem d'anguj-. D'aŋku can only be used in present indicative as it behaves like a noun: it takes nominal predicative endings. D'anguj- (a composite of d'aŋku and ij- \"be\") is used for all other tense/mood combinations.\n\nSubordination is typically formed by constructions with non-finite verbal forms. Such constructions are usually placed before the constituents they modify. The relative construction is always placed immediately before the modified constituent, whereas other types of constructions allow other constituents to interfere. The word order in such construction is the same as in simple sentences (Tereščenko, 1973).\n\nCoordination is most often achieved by means of intonation. Sometimes pronominal and adverbial derivatives can be used as conjunctions. For example, adverb ŋonə 'also' can be used as conjunction. The category of conjunctions may be undergoing formation under the influence of Russian (Tereščenko, 1973).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "526594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=526594", "title": "Person of color", "text": "Person of color\n\nThe term \"person of color\" (plural: people of color, persons of color; sometimes abbreviated POC) is used primarily in the United States to describe any person who is not white. The term encompasses all non-white people, emphasizing common experiences of systemic racism. The term may also be used with other collective categories of people such as \"communities of color\", \"men of color\" (MOC), and \"women of color\" (WOC). \"Person of color\" was originally equivalent in use to the term \"colored\", but usage of the appellation \"colored\" in the Southern United States gradually came to be restricted to \"negroes\".\n\nThe \"American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style\" cites usage of \"people of colour\" as far back as 1796. It was initially used to refer to light-skinned people of mixed African and European heritage. French colonists used the term \"gens de couleur\" (\"people of color\") to refer to people of mixed African and European descent who were freed from slavery in the Americas. In South Carolina and other parts of the Deep South, this term was used to distinguish between slaves who were mostly \"black\" or \"negro\" and free people who were primarily \"mulatto\" or \"mixed race\". After the American Civil War, \"colored\" was used as a label exclusively for black Americans, but the term eventually fell out of favor by the mid-20th century. \n\nAlthough American activist Martin Luther King Jr. used the term \"citizens of color\" in 1963, the phrase in its current meaning did not catch on until the late 1970s. In the late 20th century, the term \"person of color\" was introduced in the United States in order to counter the condescension implied by the terms \"non-white\" and \"minority\", and racial justice activists in the U.S., influenced by radical theorists such as Frantz Fanon, popularized it at this time. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was in wide circulation. Both anti-racist activists and academics sought to move the understanding of race beyond the black-white dichotomy then prevalent.\n\nThe phrase \"women of color\" was developed and introduced for wide use by a group of black women activists at the National Women's Conference in 1977. The phrase was used as a method of communicating solidarity between non-white women that was, according to Loretta Ross, not based on \"biological destiny\" but instead a political act of naming themselves.\n\nAccording to Stephen Saris, in the United States there are two main racial divides. The first is the \"black–white\" divide, which he describes as \"basically anti-black\". The second racial divide is the one \"between whites and everyone else\" with whites being \"narrowly construed\" and everyone else being called \"people of color\". Because the term \"people of color\" includes vastly different people with only the common distinction of not being white, it draws attention to the fundamental role of racialization in the United States. Joseph Tuman argues that the term \"people of color\" is attractive because it unites disparate racial and ethnic groups into a larger collective in solidarity with one another.\n\nUse of the term \"person of color\", especially in the United States, is often associated with the social justice movement. Style guides from the American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style, the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and Mount Holyoke College all recommend the term \"person of color\" over other alternatives. Unlike \"colored\", which refers only to blacks and is often considered offensive, \"person of color\" and its variants refer inclusively to all non-European peoples—often with the notion that there is political solidarity among them—and \"are virtually always considered terms of pride and respect\"; others find the phrase offensive because it implies that neither whites nor Caucasians have any color.\n\nSome critics, both whites and non-whites, of the term object to its lack of specificity and find the phrase racially offensive. It has been argued that term lessens the focus on individual issues facing different racial groups and that, as the only group excluded, is it inherently discriminatory towards white people.\n\n"}

In English the building method is also called large panel system-building or LPS.\n\nPrefabrication was pioneered in the Netherlands following World War I, based on construction methods developed in the United States. The first German use of plattenbau construction is what is now known as the \"Splanemann-Siedlung\" in Berlin's Lichtenberg district, constructed in 1926–1930. These two- and three-storey apartment houses were assembled of locally cast slabs, inspired by the Dutch \"Betondorp\" in Watergraafsmeer, a suburb of Amsterdam.\n\nIn East Germany, Plattenbau areas have been designated as \"Neubaugebiet\" (\"New development area\"). Virtually all new residential buildings since the 1960s were built in this style, as it was a quick and relatively inexpensive way to curb the country's severe housing shortage, which had been caused by wartime bombing raids and the large influx of German refugees from further east. At the same time, many buildings from earlier eras had substantial drawbacks, such as coal heat, no hot running water, or bathrooms shared by multiple units. As these buildings fell into disrepair, many of their inhabitants moved into newer \"Plattenbau\" housing. Today, 'Plattenbau' are often no longer desirable, due in part to their rapid deterioration as a direct result of their cheap and quick construction methods, while older housing stock has undergone extensive renovation or been replaced with more modern dwelling units.\n\nThere were several common plattenbau designs. The most common series was the P2, followed by the WBS 70, the WHH GT 18, and Q3A. The designs were flexible and could be built as towers or rows of apartments of various heights.\n\nThere have been projects with low rise \"plattenbauten\" such as the town of Bernau just north of Berlin. This town had an almost complete historic center of mainly wooden framed buildings within its preserved city walls. Most of these were torn down after 1975 and during the eighties to be replaced by 2–4 storey buildings constructed of prefabricated concrete slabs. However, it is to be noted that this 'development' and 'modernization' is today regarded as disastrous, and an enormous cultural loss, with the town largely replaced by drab concrete buildings of exceeding mediocrity.\n\nTo fit in with the medieval church and the almost complete city wall, the houses used rather small design units and decreased in height the farther away they were from the Church and the nearer they came to the city wall. A similar project was the Nikolaiviertel around the historic Nikolai church in Berlin's old centre. In the case of the Nikolaiviertel the buildings were made to look more historic.\n\nPlattenbau apartments were once considered highly desirable in East Germany, largely due to the lack of any other viable alternative. The main alternatives of the time were overcrowded, deteriorating prewar housing, often with wartime damage still visible, due to policies that chose not to repair the damaged housing stock. Since reunification a combination of decreasing population, renovation of older buildings, and construction of modern alternative housing has led to high vacancy rates, with some estimates placing the number of unoccupied units at around a million. Many plattenbau apartments were built in giant settlements, often on the edge of cities (such as Marzahn and Hellersdorf in Berlin and Halle-Neustadt), making them inconveniently located. Their inconvenient locations were likely also a factor in their rapid deterioration. However, despite the centrally located buildings of the International Building Exposition in Berlin, the neighbourhood today is not considered particularly desirable, and is characterised by deserted streets and apartment buildings isolated from one another in a lifeless garden.\n\nWhile some plattenbau apartments have been renovated to a high standard, some are being torn down, although a lack of funds means many have been left to become derelict, as without extensive renovation, the cheap and low-quality construction of the original buildings meant that after only a few years, they had become severely deteriorated. Because of the modular construction some are dismantled and moved to a new location, which only proves that they were cheap and temporary constructions, which were not built to last, evident even at the time when they were new.\n\nEastern Berlin has many \"Plattenbauten\": reminders of Eastern Bloc planned residential areas, with shops and schools in a ratio fixed to the number of residents. Berlin-based architect David Chipperfield has suggested that the plain appearance of Plattenbau housing does not promote gentrification, and may be a factor that helps preserve social continuity for local residents and neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "277163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=277163", "title": "Predictive dialer", "text": "Predictive dialer\n\nA predictive dialer dials a list of telephone numbers and connects answered dials to people making calls, often referred to as agents. Predictive dialers use statistical algorithms to minimize the time that agents spend waiting between conversations, while minimizing the occurrence of someone answering when no agent is available.\n\nWhen dialing numbers one at a time, there are two sources of delay. First, only some fraction of dials are answered; for example, if 1 out of 3 dials are answered, a predictive dialer might dial 3 lines every time an agent becomes available. Second, even dials that are answered take some time before being picked up. If it typically takes 10 seconds for someone to pick up, and conversations typically last 90 seconds, a predictive dialer might start dialing at 80 seconds. A predictive dialer does so by discarding all tones and only passing \"Hellos\" from the lead to the agent, the total time can be as short as 3 seconds between calls, as opposed to nearly a minute if the agent dialed by hand. The 57 second difference is an extraordinary amount of time for a call center to consider.\n\nDialing one number at a time, only when an agent is available, typically keeps agents utilized for 40 minutes per hour (33% idle time). Predictive dialing can increase utilization to 57 minutes per hour (5% idle time).\n\nPredictive dialers may be standalone hardware devices, cloud-based, or they may be integrated in software with call center or contact center platforms. A cloud-based predictive dialer provides the functionalities of a traditional predictive dialer without requiring installation on the local device and reduces the dependency on the hardware. The dialer can often also perform less aggressive dialing modes such as, power, progressive, or preview dialing.\n\nIn the UK, Ofcom requires that predictive dialers abandon fewer than 3% of answered calls on a daily basis. Ofcom also requires that if an agent is not available within 2 seconds the call is considered \"abandoned\" and an automated message is played. The automated message must identify the company making the call, the purpose of the call, a free phone or basic rate phone number to call back on and must not contain any form of marketing. A phone call to the return number must not be treated by the company as an opportunity to market, but to be removed from the calling list. In the UK \"abandoned\" calls must not be called back within 72 hours unless there is a dedicated agent available.\n\nIn the United States, if someone answers but no agent is available within 2 seconds of the person's greeting, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations consider the call \"abandoned\" and require the dialer to play a recorded message. The FCC requires that predictive dialers abandon less than 3% of answered calls.\n\nIn 1991 the Telephone Consumer Protection Act prohibited the use of an “automatic telephone dialing system” to contact “any telephone number assigned to a mobile telephone service” without “express prior consent” from the party being called. Dialing “accidents” are not an effective legal defense and penalties run from $500 to $1,500 per violating call.\n\nIn Canada, the maximum abandon rate is 5%, and calls cannot be made to numbers registered with the National Do Not Call Registry, emergency or health care providers. However, not-for-profit organizations such as survey companies are exempt from the National Do Not Call Registry.\n\n"}

{"id": "29782279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29782279", "title": "Proto-Tai language", "text": "Proto-Tai language\n\nProto-Tai is the reconstructed common ancestor (proto-language) of all the Tai languages, including modern Lao, Shan, Tai Lü, Tai Dam, Ahom, Northern Thai, Thai, Bouyei, and Zhuang. The Proto-Tai language is not directly attested by any surviving texts, but has been reconstructed using the comparative method.\nIt was reconstructed in 1977 by Li Fang-Kuei and by Pittayawat Pittayaporn in 2009.\n\nThe following table shows the consonants of Proto-Tai according to Li Fang-Kuei's \"A Handbook of Comparative Tai\" (1977), considered the standard reference in the field. Li does not indicate the exact quality of the consonants denoted here as , and , which are indicated in his work as \"č čh ž\" and described merely as palatal affricate consonants.\n\nThe table below lists the consonantal phonemes of Pittayawat Pittayaporn's 2009 reconstruction of Proto-Tai (Pittayaporn 2009:70). Some of the differences are simply different interpretations of Li's consonants: the palatal consonants are interpreted as stops, rather than affricates, and the glottalized consonants are described using symbols for implosive consonants. However, Pittayaporn's Proto-Tai reconstruction has a number of real differences from Li:\n\nThere is a total of 33-36 consonants, 10-11 consonantal syllable codas and 25-26 tautosyllabic consonant clusters.\n\nTai languages have many fewer possible consonants in coda position than in initial position. Li (and most other researchers) construct a Proto-Tai coda inventory that is identical with the system in modern Thai.\n\nPittayaporn's Proto-Tai reconstructed consonantal syllable codas also include *-l, *-c, and possibly *-ɲ, which are not included in most prior reconstructions of Proto-Tai (Pittayaporn 2009:193). Below is a table of the consonantal syllabic coda inventory proposed by Pittayaporn (2009).\n\nLi (1977) reconstructs the following initial clusters:\n\nPittayaporn (2009) reconstructs two types of complex onsets for Proto-Tai:\n\n\nTautosyllabic consonant clusters from Pittayaporn (2009:139) are given below, some of which have the medials *-r-, *-l-, and *-w-.\n\nPittayaporn's Proto-Tai reconstruction also has sesquisyllabic consonant clusters. Michel Ferlus (1990) had also previously proposed sesquisyllables for \"Proto-Thai-Yay\". The larger Tai-Kadai family is reconstructed with disyllabic words that ultimately collapsed to monosyllabic words in the modern Tai languages. However, irregular correspondences among certain words (especially in the minority non-Southwestern-Tai languages) suggest to Pittayaporn that Proto-Tai had only reached the sesquisyllabic stage (with a main monosyllable and optional preceding minor syllable). The subsequent reduction to monosyllables occurred independently in different branches, with the resulting apparent irregularities in synchronic languages reflecting Proto-Tai sesquisyllables.\n\nExamples of sesquisyllables include:\n\n\n\n\n\nOther clusters include *r.t-, *t.h-, *q.s-, *m.p-, *s.c-, *z.ɟ-, *g.r-, *m.n-; *gm̩.r-, *ɟm̩ .r-, *c.pl-, *g.lw-; etc.\n\nBelow are Proto-Tai vowels from Pittayaporn (2009:192). Unlike Li's system, Pittayaporn's system has vowel length contrast. There is a total of 7 vowels with length contrast and 5 diphthongs.\n\nThe diphthongs from Pittayaporn (2009) are:\n\nProto-Tai had three contrasting tones on syllables ending with sonorant finals (\"live syllables\"), and no tone contrast on syllables with obstruent finals (\"dead syllables\"). This is very similar to the situation in Middle Chinese. For convenience in tracking historical outcomes, Proto-Tai is usually described as having four tones, namely *A, *B, *C, and *D (Pittayaporn 2009), where *D is a non-phonemic tone automatically assumed by all dead syllables. These tones can be further split into a voiceless (*A1 [1], *B1 [3], *C1 [5], *D1 [7]) and voiced (*A2 [2], *B2 [4], *C2 [6], *D2 [8]) series. The *D tone can also be split into the *DS (short vowel) and *DL (long vowel) tones. With voicing contrast, these would be *DS1 [7], *DS2 [8], *DL1 [9], and *DL2 [10].\n\nThe following table of the phonetic characteristics of Proto-Tai tones was adapted from Pittayaporn (2009:271). Note that *B and *D are phonetically similar.\n\nProto-Tai tones take on various tone values and contours in modern Tai languages. These tonal splits are determined by the following conditions:\n\nIn addition, William J. Gedney developed a \"tone-box\" method to help determine historical tonal splits and mergers in modern Tai languages. There is a total of 20 possible slots in what is known as a \"Gedney Box.\" (For a tutorial on Gedney boxes, see \"A checklist for determining tones in Tai dialects\" (1989) by William Gedney).\n\nProto-Tai tones correspond regularly to Middle Chinese tones. (Note that Old Chinese did not have tones.) The following tonal correspondences are from Luo (2008). Note that Proto-Tai tone *B corresponds to Middle Chinese tone C, and vice versa.\n\nGedney (1972) also included a list of diagnostic words to determine tonal values, splits, and mergers for particular Tai languages. At least three diagnostic words are needed for each cell of the Gedney Box. The diagnostic words preceding the semicolons are from Gedney (1972), and the ones following the semicolons are from Somsonge (2012) and Jackson, \"et al.\" (2012). Standard Thai (Siamese) words are given below, with transliterations in \"italics\".\n\nNote that the diagnostic words listed above cannot all be used for other Tai-Kadai branches such as Kam-Sui, since tones in other branches may differ. The table below illustrates these differences among Tai and Kam-Sui etyma.\n\nIn 2007, Peter K. Norquest undertook a preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Southern Kra-Dai, which is ancestral to the Hlai languages, Ong Be language, and Tai languages. There are 28 consonants, 5-7 vowels, 9 closed rimes (not including vowel length), and at least 1 diphthong, *ɯa(C).\n\nProto-Southern Kra-Dai medial consonants also include:\n\n\nProto-Southern Kra-Dai also includes the diphthong *ɯa(C).\n\nUnlike its modern-day monosyllabic descendants, Proto-Tai was a sesquisyllabic language (Pittayaporn 2009). Below are some possible Proto-Tai syllable shapes from Pittayaporn (2009:64).\n\n\"Legend\":\n\nDuring the evolution from Proto-Tai to modern Tai languages, monosyllabification involved a series of 5 steps (Pittayaporn 2009:181).\n\nRobert M. W. Dixon (1998) suggests that the Proto-Tai language was fusional in its morphology because of related sets of words among the language's descendants that appear to be related through ablaut.\n\nProto-Tai had a SVO (subject–verb–object) word order like Chinese and all modern Tai languages. Its syntax was heavily influenced by Chinese.\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries\n"}

The emir formed an alliance with the Medici ruler, Cosimo II, and spent two years under his protection. He spent three more in Sicily and Naples seeking, and failing, to rally a Crusade against Ottoman rule.

In the sparsely available material on the subject, ǂAkhoe and Haiǁom have been considered a variant of the Khoekhoe language, as separate dialects (Haacke et al. 1997), as virtual synonyms of a single variant (Heikinnen, n.d.), or as \"a way in which some Haiǁom speak their language in the northern part of Namibia\" (Widlock, n.d.). ǂAkhoe especially is intermediate between the Khoekhoe and Kalahari branches of the Khoe language family.\n\nThe Haiǁom are traditionally hunter-gatherers, and many aspects of this traditional culture have been preserved in spite of the political, economic, and linguistic marginalisation of the group. Characteristical features of their culture include healing trance dances, hunting magic, intensive usage of wild plant and insect food, a unique kinship and naming system, frequent storytelling, and the use of a landscape-term system for spatial orientation.\n\nThe Haiǁom live in the savannah of northern Namibia, in an area stretching from the edges of Etosha salt pan and the northern white farming areas as far as the Angola border – and perhaps beyond – in the north and Kavango in the east. \nAccording to \"Ethnologue\" there were 48,400 Haiǁom speakers in 2006, but as with all figures on people and languages of low reputation this count might not be very reliable.\n\nIn theory ǂAkhoe possesses free word order, with the subject–object–verb order (SOV) being the dominant preference. In keeping with the typological profile of SOV languages, adjectives, demonstratives and numerals generally precede nouns. Nouns are marked by person–gender–number (PGN) markers. Adjectives, demonstratives and numerals all agree with their head noun.\n\nFor example,\n\nMãa is an interrogative used freely in Haiǁom, the subject \"|ũ\" takes the suffix \"-ba\", which is a PGN marker denoting the 3rd person masculine singular. The indirect object \"nde\", a demonstrative, follows the noun, and is inflected in concord with the head noun.\n\nCompound structures are highly productive in ǂAkhoe and vary widely in the combination of word categories. The possibilities include: noun+noun, noun+adverb or vice versa, noun+adjective or vice versa, adjective+adjective, adjective+adverb or vice versa, adjective+suffix, or multiple combinations of the above.\n\nComparing Heikinnen’s and Widlock’s contribution to ǂAkhoe phonology with the more general and theoretical phonological work of Peter Ladefoged (1996), ǂAkhoe can be said to have 47 phonemes. However, an in-depth phonological sketch of the language might show other results where the vowels are concerned.\n\nThere are 34 consonants in ǂAkhoe, 20 of which are clicks produced with an ingressive airstream, and 14 of which are pulmonic consonants produced with an egressive airstream.\n\nǂAkhoe Haiǁom has a total of 12 vowel phonemes. These can be divided into monophthongs and diphthongs, with a further subdivision into oral and nasal pronunciation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
