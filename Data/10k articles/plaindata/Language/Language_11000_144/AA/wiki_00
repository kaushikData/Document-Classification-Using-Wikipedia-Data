Niranjan is another name of Lord Shiva. Also spelled, \"Alekh\".\n\nThe original Sanskrit term \"Alakhshya\" means \"one that can not be perceived\"\n\nAlakh means A-Lakhshana which means beyond identifying features (lakhshana) or attributes. It refers to Attributeless God or Nirguna Brahman in here. This idea comes from ancient Yoga traditions originating in Swetashwetara Upanishad. This particular Upanishad deals with Yoga, Vedantic Monotheism as well as Shiva as Sat-Chit-Ananda.\nLegend has it, that the slogan or elating cry for the Supreme Being was first coined by Matsyendranath\". Matsyendra is popularly regarded as the 'second Guru' of Nath Yoga Cult after Lord Shiva as Adinath. He first used the words \"Alakh Niranjan\" to denote God as perceived by a Yoga adept in known history. His disciple is known as \"Yogi Gorakhnath\", also known as \"Gorakshanath\", without whose mention, Nath Yoga becomes unimaginable. It is Gorakhnath and Matsyendranath who popularised Kaya Sadhana throughout known limits of India and beyond. \n\nGorakhnath actually organised and assimilated most Yogis of the Hatha Yoga and Tantra Cult into the enormous Nath tradition. The city of Gorakhpur in North India is named after the legendary Yogi. 'Alakh Niranjan' became a very popular name for God all over India during and after Gorakhnath's time. Later first Sikh Guru, Nanak used this holy name to denote God.\n\nADESH ADESH - \nWhenever Yogis or Nath-Yogis meet, they greet each other with the salutation “Adesh-Adesh!” Gorakshanath the Maha Yogi wrote:\n\nThus the yogi in his contact with others expressed only the simple truth in the words, “Adesh-Adesh!” It is a foundation stone on which all spiritual light and attainment must be erected. It is the first truth to attain the First Lord\n\nAlakh Niranjan was adapted into Indian films in 1940, 1950, and in 1975 by Babubhai Mistry.\n"}
{"id": "9396262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9396262", "title": "Aneityum language", "text": "Aneityum language\n\nAnejom̃ or Aneityum (also spelled \"Anejom\", and formerly \"Aneiteum\", \"Aneityumese\") is an Oceanic language spoken by 900 people () on Aneityum Island, Vanuatu. It is the only indigenous language of Aneityum.\n\nAnejom̃ is part of the Austronesian language family, and is part of the large subgroup of Oceanic languages. Anejom̃ falls under the Southern Oceanic Languages subgroup, and more specifically Southern Vanuatuan Languages. It constitutes its own separate branch of Southern Vanuatuan languages. While Anejom̃ is now considered to be only one language, some historical reports have suggested that Anejom̃ might have consisted of two very distinct dialects. Its closest relatives are preliminarily thought to be more closely related to the languages of Tanna (e.g. Kwamera, South-West Tanna, Lenakel) than Erromango languages.\n\nThe island of Aneityum is the southernmost inhabited island of the nation of Vanuatu. It is closest to the islands of Tanna and Futuna. The island's geographic location made Anejom̃ develop in isolation. The first speakers of the language are believed to have lived on hillsides near coasts in order to access resources. However, due to land degradation and population pressure, the speakers moved to the valleys.\n\nAneityum is thought to have been settled around 874 BCE +/- 60 years by people coming over from Tanna. Original settlers (and speakers of the language) are thought to have lived on hillsides near the coasts in order to access resources from the ocean and land. However, the combination of land degradation and population forced the Aneityumese to move onto valley flats instead.\n\nThe original political system was like much of Melanesia; it was composed of multiple chiefs (\"natimarid)\" ruling over many chiefdoms (\"neclau\"). According to oral tradition, the island had two chiefdoms but they split to then form seven chiefdoms each \"further divided into a number of districts between fifty and sixty in number\".\n\nThe first contact with Europeans was in 1830, when the brig \"Alpha\" landed in Aneityum with hopes of establishing a sandalwood trading business.\n\nThe population of the Aneityumese has greatly declined over the years (along with the number of speakers); however, the population has seen a bit of a resurgence in the present. Most of the population was decimated by two major epidemics in the 1830s and 1840s and never fully recovered as can be seen below:\nLike much of the rest of Melanesia, the church has played an important role in language ideology on Aneityum. The first missionaries to land on the island were Samoan Presbyterians who arrived in 1841. After them followed European Presbyterian missionaries who established themselves in 1848. With the large missionary presence on the island, many schools were founded to spread the message of Christianity. In these schools, the classroom was mainly conducted in Anejom̃, however numeracy was conducted in English. The missionary presence on the island was so prevalent that the island was considered the \"first successfully missionized island in Melanesia\" and housed the headquarters of the Presbyterian Mission to the New Hebrides.\n\nThe missions on Aneityum promoted the use of English.\n\nVanuatu came under joint British and French rule in 1887, which then became formalized in 1906 where Vanuatu became known as the \"Anglo-French Condominium\". Colonialization along with the big mission presence on the island led to the languages of French and English to become prestige languages. Other languages of Vanuatu also became prestigious (such as Nguna) because these language were chosen by missionaries to spread their teachings. With prolonged contact with English speakers, another language also arose: Bislama. Bislama, a pidgin of English, is now an extremely widely used language and has had a huge role in language change within Anejom̃.\n\nAnejom̃ has 5 vowels and 20 or 21 consonants. The sound [ʔ] is sometimes counted as phoneme. Vowel and consonant length is contrastive in this language and is shown in orthography by writing the vowel or consonant twice.\nAnejom̃ was never a written language and so traditionally did not have an orthography. The first orthography was made by the missionary John Inglis in 1882. It was considered to be a fairly good orthography of its time (having a one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes), however it did contain several key problems. \nA new orthography more accepted by Anejom̃ speakers now is shown below.\n\nThe moderately phonemic glottal stop is an allophone of /h/ when it occurs before a consonant. It also occurs as an allophone before vowels that occur in the word initial position.\n\nThe phoneme /ɲ/ becomes [j̃] after a high vowel.\n\nStops and affricates in Anejom̃ change in voicing depending where they occur between segments as described and illustrated below.\n\nThere are three types of pronouns in Anejom̃: personal, demonstrative and interrogative pronouns.\n\nAnejom̃ \"personal pronouns distinguish (a) three persons, with a further distinction of inclusive and exclusive in first person non-singular; (b) four numbers (singular, dual, trial and plural); and (c) three cases (focal, object and possessive).\" The table below shows all of the personal pronouns.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>The focal pronouns \"aek\" and \"aen\" are only used in writing or when a speaker speaks slowly. Most of the time the pronouns aak and aan, respectively, are used instead (and are generally pronounced with short vowels instead of long vowels). Below is an example of a focal pronoun.\n\n\"Et amjeg aan*\"\n\n3SG.AR sleep (s)he\n\n'He/she/it is sleeping.'\n\nObject pronouns are free morphemes and occur after verbs and certain \"case-marking prepositions\" as seen below. \n\n\"Arodei ra aak!\"\n\nwhip them.PL you.SG\n\n'Whip them!'\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>The 2SG and 3SG object pronouns normally occur as yic and yin, however when a vowel precedes these pronouns then they change to the suffixes -c and -n respectively.\n\n\"*Et emtita-i yic aan. -----> Et emitita-c aan.\"\n\n3SG.AR fear-TR you.SG.O (s)he \"----->\" 3SG.AR fear-2SG.O (s)he\n\n'He's frightened of you'\n\nPossessive pronouns occur as suffixes and can be attached to \"directly possessed nouns and possessive markers, some case-markers, and to members of one sub-class of verbs\". See below.\n\n\"Alum̃a-k ti aak\"\n\ngive.to.drink-my tea you.SG\n\n'Give me some tea (to drink).'\n\nThere are two interrogative pronouns in Anejom̃: \"di\" ('who') and \"panid\" and its less widely used alternate, \"panida\" ('which').\n\n\"Et adel a di?\"\n\n3SG.AR fart S who\n\n'Who farted?'\n\nHowever, \"'di\"' is \"inherently singular\" and requires a coordinate phrase with \"im,\" as seen in the example here, to express plurality.\n\n\"Era apam di im di?\"\n\n3PL.AR come who and who\n\n'Who (PL) came?\"\n\n\"Panid\" and \"Panida\" can only be used to refer to inanimate objects.\n\n\"'Le naifi enai aak!\"'\n\ntake.SG knife DEM2.SG you.SG\n\n\"'Panid?'\"\n\nwhich.one\n\nDemonstrative Pronouns also have singular, dual, trial and plural forms like personal pronouns (see below).\n\nIn Anejom̃, demonstrative pronouns can also take the suffix \"-sak\" which denotes that the speaker is \"pointing at or in some other way indicating the location of the thing referred to.\"\n\n\"Alp̃a-i ñak jeknaa-sak aak.\"\n\ngive-TR me this2.PL-INDIC you.SG\n\n'Give me those ones there (that I'm pointing at).'\n\nAnejom̃ has several categories for nouns: temporal, locative, personal, obligatorily possessed and optionally possessed nouns. The latter two categories (obligatorily possessed and optionally possessed nouns), are further distinguished based on animacy (as seen below). \nExamples of common temporal nouns can be seen below.\nLocative nouns in Anejom̃ do not need the case marker \"a\" to occur in front of it as shown in the example below.\n\n\"Et m̃an apan aan Isia\"\n\n3SG.AR PF go (s)he Isia.\n\n'He went to Isia.'\n\nLocative nouns also include the following words:\nPersonal Nouns include kinship terms as well as names of people.\n\nThese nouns must \"be marked as being possessed by some other noun or pronoun\", which tends to be marked by suffixation. Most of the obligatorily possessed nouns are kinship terms.\n\nAn example of direct suffixation can be seen in the examples below.\n\n\"etma-n\"\n\nfather-his/her\n\n'his/her father'\n\n\"etma-ra\"\n\nfather-their.PL\n\n'their father'\n\nThere are some nouns that do not take direct suffixation but rather use possessive markers such as the word for \"child\", \"nephew\", \"niece\", and \"sister,\" to name a few.\n\nUnlike obligatorily possessed nouns, these nouns do not, or do not have to, take possession markers.\n\nAnejom̃ has a distinction between animate and inanimate nouns which is further divided into obligatorily possessed and optionally possessed nouns.\n\nAnimate nouns are usually marked by using the subject marker \"a\" for singular and the prefix \"elpu-\" for plural\".\"\n\n\"Et alp̃as a pikad uñu-m̃.\"\n\n3SG.AR big S pig POSS.G-your.SG\n\n'Your pig is (getting) big.'\n\nPluralization of the word meaning 'man' to 'men' seen below.\n\n\"natam̃añ → elpu-atam̃añ\"\n\nInanimate nouns are not marked in either the singular or plural.\n\nAnejom̃ has several key prefixes that serve important roles:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>\"Inta-\" is used sparingly compared to the other prefixes. Most of the time, instrumental nouns are compounds that include the word '\"nitai',\" which is most likely where \"'inta\"' comes from.\n\nThe \"n-\"/\"in-\" prefix is a frequently used as well as frequently occurring underlying morpheme: it accounts for around 85% of Anejom̃ nouns. The other approximate 15% of nouns that don't use this prefix tend to be highly specific groups of nouns.\n\nAnejom̃ also has a different set of prefixes that are referred to as collective prefixes as they refer to large groups of things:\n\nIn Anejom̃, the possessive form of personal pronouns are attached directly to the noun when \"the possessor is a personal pronoun\".\n\n\"nijma-k\"\n\nhand-my\n\n'my hand'\n\nFor all other nouns that cannot be directly possessed, a \"possessive or construct suffix is added to a possessive marker\" as seen below. \n\n\"intal inca-i di?\"\n\ntaro POSS.F-CS who\n\n'whose taro?'\nVerbs in Anejom̃ are words that can occur as the head of a verb phrase. In Anejom̃, verbs are distinguished by transitivity; there are transitive, intransitive and (the family small class of) ambi-transitive verbs. Examples of these verbs can be seen below.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Many transitive verbs also have intransitive pairings as can be seen by the two verbs that mean 'to eat' in the table above.\n\nBoth of these verbs are unusual in that they do not follow the regular pattern.\n\n\"'Yek\"' is an existential verb that is different from the majority of Anejom̃ verbs in a number of ways.\n\nThis verb marks the reflexive or reciprocal and takes an agreeing possessive suffix as seen below.\n\n\"Et isp̃a-n edel aan.\"\n\n3SG.AR REFL-its grow it\n\n'It grew by itself'.\n\n The vowel (i) is only added if it occurs before a consonant.\n\nAnejom̃ does have reduplication although it is not used very often. It most commonly occurs as complete reduplication as seen below.\nNot including the verbs which take possessive suffixes, there are three main types of ways in which transitive verbs are marked. The types of verbs are: 1) unmarked verbs, 2) \"verbs that take the transitive suffix \"-\"i\"\" with all objects\", 3) verbs that only take \"-\"i\"\" with animate objects and \"-ñ\" with inanimate objects.\nThese suffixes attach to the end of the verb and will come after a transitive suffix if one occurs. \n\nDistance suffixes have to combine with horizontal or vertical suffixes; they cannot be alone. The ordering of these suffixes are as follows: 1) VERTICAL, 2) HORIZONTAL, 3) DISTANCE.\n\nIn a verb phrase, a subject marking morpheme tends to occur first (except if it is an imperative, optionally conjoined, or subordinate clause). In Anejom̃, subject-tense-aspect marking is undergoing radical change.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of change in present day subject-tense marking, especially in the plural subject-tense marking category by younger speakers. Here are all the (competing) subject-tense markers used in modern Anejom̃.\nAnejom̃ has several markers (different than the subject-markers) which indicate a variety of mood, aspect and tense.\nCompounding is a key historical and modern feature of Anejom̃; it has both compound nouns and compound verbs. Compound nouns generally consist of a noun followed by either a noun, verb, modifier or a possessive construction, and compound verbs tend to be a combination of two verbs, although sometimes a verb is followed by a noun. Compounding is so prevalent, that historical linguistics use modern (as well as fossilized compounds) to trace genealogical relationships between Oceanic languages. Another one of the key uses of compounding in Anejom̃, is it is used to form the instrumental case. Examples of compounding can be seen below.\nAnejom̃ word order is fairly strict and does not allow for much variation. The preferred word order in Anejom̃ is VOS (or verb, followed by object, then subject). This word order is extremely unusual within the languages of Vanuatu and makes Anejom̃ the \"only non-Polynesian language in Vanuatu to have this preferred word order.\" Below are a couple of examples of intransitive and transitive sentences.\n\nIntransitive Sentences\n\n\"[Et apam] [a di].\"\n\n3SG.AR come S who\n\n‘Who’s coming?.’\n\n[\"Jim lav aak\"].\n\nDONT make.noise you.SG\n\n'Don't (you sg.) make a noise!\n\nTransitive Sentence\n\n[ \"Eris lecse-i\"] [\"isji-tal\"] [\"aarau\"].\n\n3PL.P take.PL-TR fruits-taro they.DL\n\n'The two of them took the taro corms.'\n\nWhile Anejom̃ has a fairly strict word order, there are times that the language departs from the standard VOS order.\n\nAnejom̃ has multiple cases that are denoted by several different case markers summed up below.\nTemporal phrases can be marked with or without a case depending on the phrase.\n\nUnmarked temporal phrases take a temporal noun and unmarked locative phrases take either a locative noun or a locative demonstrative. There are two types of local demonstratives: the first type is the one seen in the table below and the second is formed adding locative suffixes (see table earlier on page) to the root \"'au'.\"\n\nLocative Demonstratives that are formed by adding the locative suffixes to the root \"au-\" must follow a specific order:\n\n\"au-\" VERTICAL - DISTANCE\n\n\"au-\" HORIZONTAL - DISTANCE\n\n\"au -\" VERTICAL - HORIZONTAL - DISTANCE\n\nMarked temporal phrases and place phrases (that don't have a non-personal noun at the head), take the case marker \"'a'.\" For non-personal place phrases, the case marker \"'u'\" is used instead. When a place phrase uses a personal noun or pronoun, \"ehele-\" is used instead of either \"'a'\" or \"'u\"'.\n\nThere are two types of questions: yes/no and content questions.\n\nYes/no questions can be asked in two ways. One way to indicate a question is by ending a phrase on a raised intonation. The second way is to add the word '\"ka a'o'\" (which means \"'or no\"') to the end of a sentence.\n\nUnlike yes/no questions, content questions use interrogative morphemes such as:\n\n'who': \"di\"\n\n\"\"'what': \"inhe\"\n\n'which/which one': \"panid/panida\"\n\n'when': \"nuhup̃an\"\n\n'which/which thing': \"nev(e)-\"\n\n'where': \"eda\" (acts like a locative noun)\n\n'how to': \"ehv(e)-\" (verbal prefix)\n\nThere are several different ways to combine clauses together:\n\nIn simple clause chaining, no conjunctions are markings are used to link two separate clauses together. Simple clause chaining can be used either for clauses of the same or different subject and for both verbal and verbless clauses.\n\n[\"Ekrau edou ajamrau\"], [\"ek ap̃ahni añak era-i iji-teptag asga\"].\n\n1EXC.DL.AR roam we.EXC.DL 1SG.AR go.everywhere I LOC-CS COL-nakamal all\n\n'We wandered around and I went to every single nakamal.'\n\nThere are three conjunctions that combine clauses in Anejom̃: '\"ka\"', '\"jai',\" and '\"jam\"' which are the equivalents of 'or', 'but' and 'but' respectively.\n\n'Ka'\n\n[\"Et m̃an ecohos nagesga\"] \"ka\" [\"a'o\"]?\n\n3SG.AR PF appear sun or no\n\n'Has the sun risen (or not)?\n\n'\"Jai\"' and '\"Jam'\" have the same meaning, however \"'jai'\" is used when the subjects of the two combining clauses are different and '\"jam'\" is used when the two combining subjects are the same. \"'Jai\"' is also used when a subject-tense marker occurs at the beginning of the clause following it, regardless of the subject.\n\n'Jai'\n\n[\"Eris akrou m-alp̃a-i cama\"], \"jai\" [\"is p̃ar han\"]...\n\n3PL.AR share ES-give-TR us.EXC.PL.O but 3SG.P SEQ enough\n\n'They shared it out to us, but there was enough...\"\n\n'Jam'\n\n[\"Eris ago kava lum̃a-n aara\"] \"jam\" [\"ago is erou\"].\n\n3PL.P make kava POSS.D-his they.PL but.SS make 3SG.P two\n\n'They made his kava, but they made two (bowls).'\n\n\"Am̃\" and \"p̃ar\" are also conjunctions that respectively mean 'and' and 'and then, so'. However, they don't function like normal conjunctions but rather aspect markers as seen below.\n\n[\"Ekris lecse-i u-rau aarau\"], [\"isam̃ atpu tah aarau]\".\n\n3DL.P take.PL-TR POSS-3DL they.DL 3SG.P and hide one they.DL\n\n'The two of them took their, and one of them hid.'\n\n\"M-\" is attached \"to the first word in the verb phrase of a non-initial clause which has the same subject as the preceding clause\". It can also denote continuous aspect.\n\n[\"Ekris apan aarau\"] [\"m\"\"-ago nup̃ut\"] [\"m\"-\"ago ihnii\"].\n\n3DL.P go they.DL ES-make k.o.laplap ES-make finish\n\n'They two went and made nup̃ut and finished making it.'\n\nWhile verb serialization does not occur much in Anejom̃ in comparison to other Western Oceanic Languages, it occurs more commonly than in its closest related languages. Most of the verb-serializations in Anejom̃ contain directional motion verbs in the non-initial clause as seen below:\n\n[Is 'm̃an lep rectidai aataj'] [\"apan a-nlii-i niom̃\"]\n\nP PF again get.up they.TL go LOC-inside-CS house\n\n'They three got up again and went inside the house.'\n\nRelative clauses in Anejom̃ do not have relative pronouns and they directly follow the noun phrase that it is modifying. For example:\n\n[NP \"Inworen enaa\" [REL \"et amen aan im-le injap̃ era-n.\"]REL]NP...\n\nplace DEM2.SG 3SG.AR stay he ES-take.SG salt LOC-its\n\n'The place where he got salt from...'\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Part of the orthography was used officially for a time in Chile, and it influenced other Spanish-speaking countries. The aim of the orthography was a perfect correspondence between graphemes and phonemes. The reform did not succeed. Standard Spanish orthography as used for Hispanic American Spanish contains several homophones (⟨c⟩, ⟨k⟩, ⟨qu⟩; ⟨c⟩, ⟨s⟩, ⟨z⟩; ⟨g⟩, ⟨j⟩, ⟨x⟩; ⟨b⟩, ⟨v⟩; ⟨y⟩, ⟨ll⟩; ⟨i⟩, ⟨y⟩) or letters that represent more than one sound (⟨c⟩, ⟨g⟩, ⟨r⟩, ⟨x⟩, ⟨y⟩), and other variances (⟨h⟩; ⟨u⟩ after ⟨g⟩ and ⟨q⟩). Bello proposed several modifications that he believed should be undertaken in two stages:\n\n\n\nOn October 17, 1843, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (the Bello rector of the University of Chile) presented a project to the Faculty of Humanities and Philosophy: \"Report on American Orthography\".\n\nOn February 19, 1844, the Faculty judged the reform to be radical, but recommended some of Bello's ideas. The government of Chile followed this recommendation and that year introduced the following reforms:\n\nThe changes influenced Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. With time, however, Spanish orthography returned to how it had been previously. The last country to return to standard orthography was Chile, where President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo established the use of RAE orthography in teaching and official documents in Decree No. 3,876 of July 20, 1927, going into effect on October 12, 1927.\n\nThe poet and Nobel Prize winner Juan Ramón Jiménez used an orthography similar to that of Bello in his work.\n\n\n"}

The term East-Futunan is also used to distinguish it from the related West Futunan (Futuna-Aniwan) spoken on the outlier islands of Futuna and Aniwa in Vanuatu.\n\nThe language is closely related to other Western Polynesian languages, Fagauvea, Wallisian, Tongan, Samoan, Tokelau, and Niuafo’ou.\n\nIt is classified as Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, Central Pacific, East Fijian-Polynesian, Polynesian, Nuclear, Samoic-Outlier, Futunic, Futuna, East.\n\nCa. 1987, Fakafutuna was spoken by 3,600 on Futuna, as well as by some of the 3,000 migrant workers in New Caledonia.\n\nThis language is a member of the diminishing set of native Pacific languages, it is classified as endangered. \n\nKing Sigave signed a treaty establishing a French protectorate on 16 February 1888, after being pressured by missionaries to do so. The islands were put under the authority of the French colony of New Caledonia. In 1917, the three traditional kingdoms of Wallis, Futuna and Alofi were annexed as colonies of France. In 1961 citizens voted on becoming a French oversea's territory, legally unionizing Wallis and Futuna despite the fact that the islands are home to two distinct Polynesian societies with different cultures. \n\nDespite being a French colony, Futunan remained relatively protected from the linguistic consequences of European language domination. The situation began to change around the second World War when the numbers of speakers started to decline dramatically. A major event in the decline was the immigration of a large number of native Futunian speakers to New Caledonia. French has since enveloped Futunan in society, becoming the primary language used in grade schools. Futunans speak and use their language daily, mainly only using French in contact with European natives, or within the educational spheres. RFO-radio airs 15 minutes daily news broadcasts in Futunan. \n\nFutunan has five vowels; a, e (/e/), i, o, u (/u/) which can be short or long. Long vowels are denoted by a macron: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū. Futunan has 11 consonants: 4 plosives (p, k, t, and a glottal stop /ʔ/, noted by an apostrophe); 3 nasals m, n, and g (/ŋ/) and 4 fricatives f, v, l, and s. /ŋ/ corresponds to the sound ng as in \"parking\".\n\nThe Futunan has a syllabic structure of CVCV type, which means that two consonants are necessarily separated by a vowel; The opposite is not true (examples: \"eio\" (yes), \"tauasu\" (meeting where one drinks kava), \"aua\" (particle of the negative imperative), etc.). Words end with a vowel.\n\nThe third person pronoun is now rarely used in Futunan. For all pronoun references, except third person singular, Futunan offers a choice of pre-posed and post-posed pronouns, which are pronouns placed before or after the subject. Modern Futunan has done away with the possibility of expressing pre-posed and post-posed pronouns. Clitic pronouns (clitic pronouns are dependent on an adjacent word and cannot stand on their own in meaning.) of the first and second type may correspond to different types of arguments: the absolute of intransitive clauses, the ergative of transitive clauses, and the absolute of transitive clauses. In some cases unique to the Polynesian language family, Futunan uses a pre-posed pronoun to refer to the patient of an ergative verb. In casual conversation the use of a pre-verbal pronoun can be rather frequent. \n\nFutunan makes extensive syntactic use of pre-posed pronouns in conversation, where post-posed pronouns are used more in tails. Sentences containing post-posed pronouns only have two possible word orders: VAO (Verb, Adverb, Object) or VOA (Verb, Object, Adverb) (Example: etusi'i a au e lātou ke kau ano o fakafofoga loku fā kolo i le aso o Toloke. \"They represented me to go and represent the village at the festivities in Toloke\"). Co-occurring clitic and post-posed pronouns seem to have given way to the unique occurrence of post-posed pronouns with similar focusing functions.\n\nThe marker 'a' is required before definite plural nouns and noun phrases, post-verbal pronominals and proper nouns, however it is not required for phrases preceded by an article or possessive pronoun. The marker 'e' is used in front of ergative arguments. The markers 'i' and 'ki' cover a range of meanings and satisfy a range of conditions. Most commonly the objects of 'i' are obligatory, while only some objects of 'ki' are. They are used extensively as directional, causal, or instrumental case markers. They refer to destination, aim or purpose as well as verbs of feeling, address or sensation.\n\nThe verb classes consists of impersonal, intransitive (A/A + I), middle (A + Ki), transitive (A + E), \"AA + E\", \"AA + I\" or AA + E\" verbs. most AA + I and A + E verbs undergo derivation to change their argument structure. Futunan has single, double and triple argument structures. Suffixes 'i' and 'ki' are used to derive verbs, the only productive suffix is 'a' which means \"be full of\". If an absolute argument in a sentence with a non-derived verb represents an agent, it will be marked as an ergative, and a patient will be added in the absolute case (Example: \"kutu\" means lice. \"kutu-a\" means be covered with lice). if an absolutive argument represents a patient in a sentence with a derived verb, it will contain an additional ergative argument (Example: \"lamata\" means tame \"faka-lamata\" means be tamed by). In the case of middle verbs with two arguments verb derivation results in the experiencer being placed in the ergative, and the argument placed in the absolutive.\n\n"}

Scientific research has uncovered phonetically significant features produced by many gay men and demonstrated that listeners accurately guess speakers' sexual orientation at rates greater than chance. One feature of the speech is sometimes known as the \"gay lisp\", though researchers acknowledge that it is not technically a lisp. Research does not support the notion that gay speech entirely adopts feminine speech characteristics, but, rather, that it selectively adopts some of those features. Gay speech characteristics appear to be learned ways of speaking, though their origins and process of adoption by men remain unclear.\n\nLinguists have attempted to isolate exactly what makes gay men's English distinct from that of other demographics since the early 20th century, typically by contrasting it with straight male speech or comparing it to female speech. In older work, speech pathologists often focused on high pitch among men, in its resemblance to women, as a defect. Since the gay community consists of many smaller subcultures, it is likely inaccurate to presume all gay male speech falls under a single linguistically homogeneous category.\n\nThe gay lisp is one manner of speech stereotypically associated with gay speakers of American English, and perhaps other dialects or languages. It involves a marked pronunciation of sibilant consonants (particularly and ). Speech scientist Benjamin Munson and his colleagues have argued that this is not a mis-articulated (and therefore, not technically a lisp) as much as a hyper-articulated . Specifically, gay men are documented as pronouncing with higher-frequency spectral peaks, an extremely negatively-skewed spectrum, and a longer duration than heterosexual men. However, not all gay American men speak with this hyper-articulated (perhaps fewer than half), and some carefully-speaking men who identify as heterosexual also produce this feature.\n\nGay men tend to lower the vowel (except before a nasal consonant) and the vowel; this was specifically confirmed in a study of North-Central American English speakers. This linguistic phenomenon is normally associated with the California vowel shift and also reported in a study of a gay speaker of California English itself, who strengthened these same features and also fronted the and vowels when speaking with friends more than in other speaking situations. Results suggest that a California regional sound can be employed by gay men for stylistic effect, including to evoke a \"fun\" or \"partier\" persona .\n\nSome other speech features are also stereotyped as markers of gay or bisexual males: carefully enunciated pronunciation, wide pitch range (high and rapidly changing pitch), breathy voice, lengthened fricative sounds, and pronunciation of as and as (affrication), etc. Research shows that gay speech characteristics include many of the same characteristics other speakers use when attempting to speak with special carefulness or clarity, including over-articulating and expanding the vowel spaces in the mouth.\n\nIn terms of perception, the \"gay sound\" in North American English is popularly presumed to involve the pronunciation of sibilants (, , ) with noticeable assibilation, sibilation, hissing, or stridency. Frontal, dentalized and negatively-skewed articulations of (the aforementioned \"gay lisp\") are indeed found to be the most powerful perceptual indicators to a listener of a male speaker's sexual orientation, with experiments revealing that such articulations are perceived as \"gayer-sounding\" and \"younger-sounding\".\n\nGay speech is also widely stereotyped as resembling women's speech. However, on the basis of phonetics, Benjamin Munson and his colleagues' research has discovered that gay male speech does not simply or categorically imitate female speech.\n\nIn one Canadian study, listeners correctly identified gay speakers in 62% of cases. A Stanford University experiment analyzed the acoustics of eight males (four straight and four gay), who were recorded reading passages, through the perception of listener-subjects and tasked these listeners with categorizing speakers by adjectives corresponding to common U.S. stereotypes of gay men. The listeners were generally able to correctly identify the sexual orientation of the speakers, reflecting the stereotypes. However, there were no statistically significant differences the listeners identified, if they existed at all, based on intonation. These findings are representative of other studies as well.\n\nAnother study, examined the duration of certain sounds (, , and the onset of and ), frequency of stressed vowels, voice-onset time of voiceless aspirated consonants, and the release of word-final stop consonants. The study found some correlation between these speech traits and sexual orientation, but also clarified the study's narrow scope on only certain phonetic features.\n\nLanguage and gender scholar Robin Lakoff not only compares gay male with female speech but also claims that gay men deliberately imitate the latter, claiming this to include an increased use of superlatives, inflected intonation, and lisping. Later linguists have re-evaluated Lakoff's claims and concluded that these characterizations are not consistent for women, instead reflecting stereotypes that may have social meaning and importance but that do not fully capture actual gendered language use.\n\nLinguist David Crystal correlated the use among men of an \"effeminate\" or \"simpering\" voice with a widened range of pitch, glissando effects between stressed syllables, greater use of fall-rise and rise-fall tones, vocal breathiness and huskiness, and occasionally more switching to the falsetto register. Still, research has not confirmed any unique intonation or pitch qualities of gay speech. Some such characteristics have been portrayed as mimicking women's speech and judged as derogatory toward or trivializing of women.\n\nA study of over 300 Flemish-speaking Belgian participants, men and women, found a \"significantly higher prevalence\" of a \"lisp\"-like feature in gay men than in other demographics. Several studies have also examined and confirmed gay speech characteristics in Puerto Rican Spanish and other dialects of Caribbean Spanish.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1116301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1116301", "title": "Ghomara language", "text": "Ghomara language\n\nThe Ghomara language is a Northern Berber language spoken in Morocco. It is the mother tongue of the Ghomara Berbers, who total around 10,000 people. Ghomara Berber is spoken on the western edge of the Rif, among the Beni Bu Zra and Beni Mansur tribes of the Ghomara confederacy. Despite being listed as endangered, it is still being passed on to children in these areas. \n\nGhomara Berber is relatively similar to Senhadja de Srair Berber spoken around Ketama. However, it is difficult to understand for a speaker of Rifian.\n\nSome typical features that distinguish the Ghomara variety of Berber from Rifian Berber are the use of the preposition \"dar\" instead of the Rifian \"ghar\", the feminine plural ending \"-an\" instead of \"-in\", and the absence of spirantisation in word-initial position.\n\nAlthough elderly Ghomara teach children how to speak Ghomara Berber at home, the language is still considered threatened, with only 10,000 known speakers. A major reason can be attributed to the small geographical location where this language is used, as well as the more common usage of Arabic throughout Morocco.\n\nLike Arabic, Ghomara and the other Berber dialects have three vowels: a-, i-, u-.\n\nGhomara has 44 consonants, and most consonants in Ghomara have germinated forms.\nFor nouns in Ghomara Berber, there are several common trends. The prefix a-, i-, or u- commonly identifies the masculine singular nouns in the language (i.e., \"arg'az\" “man”). For feminine singular nouns, there is both a prefix and a suffix such as ta-…-t (i.e., \"tarbat\" “girl”). This is the most common way to identify feminine singular nouns. Masculine plural nouns are characterized by i-…-en or i-…-an (i.e., \"irg'azen\" “men”). For feminine plural nouns, ti-…-an (i.e., \"tirbatan\" “girls”) is the most common circumfix.\n\nGhomara Berber uses personal, singular, and plural pronouns.\n\nThe first person singular pronoun \"nekkin\" is equivalent to \"I\" in English. The second person singular male pronoun \"kedžin\" and female pronoun \"kemmin\" is equivalent to \"you\" in English. Similarly, in Ghomara Berber, the third person singular male pronoun \"netta\" and female pronoun \"nettaθa\" is equivalent to him or her in English respectively.\n\nThe first person plural pronoun \"nuçna\" is equivalent to \"we\" in English and the second person plural pronoun \"kunna\" is equivalent to \"you all\" in English. Lastly, \"niçma\" is the third person plural pronoun equivalent to \"they\" in English, and is not distinguished by gender.\n\nIn Ghomara Berber verbs contain certain affixes that characterize singularity, plurality, and point of view (POV). The following is an example of the verb conjugations for the English word \"to write\" or \"ara\" in Ghomara Berber:\nSingular:\n\nPlural:\n\nAdjectives have either suffix -ø, which characterizes masculine singular nouns or -θ, which characterizes both feminine singular and all plural nouns. For example:\n\nAn example of common English words in Ghomara Berber:\n\nGhomara Berber uses a numerical system similar to many other languages. Cardinal numbers \"yan\" (“one”, masculine) and \"yat\" (“one”, feminine) are the only Berber numerals in Ghomara, while all the other cardinal numbers are borrowed from Moroccan Arabic (\"zuž\" (“two”), \"tlata\" (“three”), \"εišrin \" (“twenty”), \"tlatin\" (“thirty”), etc).\n\n"}

He is credited as the publisher of the first ever newspaper in the Kannada language called as \"Mangalooru Samachara\" in 1843. He was awarded a doctorate for his literary work in Kannada called as \"Bibliotheca Carnataca\". He also translated Kannada literature into German. Mögling is acknowledged by Kannada writers and linguists as the first modern Kannada writer, as he produced nearly 36 literary works, considered to be ground-breaking and exceptional Kannada literature, in a short period of 20 years.\n\nHe was the founder-principal of BEM Theological Seminary, later renamed as Karnataka Theological College. He and his wife Pauline(Nee Bacmeister) laid the foundations for the Evangelical parish and Anandapur, a village made out of jungle in the interior of Karnataka.\n\nHermann Mögling was born in 1811 in the town of Brackenheim in the Kingdom of Württemberg, Germany. He studied theology in the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen and joined the Basel Mission. He came to the city of Mangalore in Karnataka as a missionary of Basel Mission in 1836. In 7 years, in 1843, Mögling had mastered Kannada, and went on to start the first Kannada newspaper - Mangalura Samachara.\n\nMögling, being a Christian missionary, was involved in missionary related work in Mangalore but he also learnt the native Kannada language and contributed significantly to Kannada literature. One of his pioneering works was the publication of the first Kannada newspaper, \"Mangalooru Samachara\" (meaning \"Mangalore News\").\n\nIn the days of Mögling's career at Mangalore, there was no simple way of communicating news and other items to the general public because of non-existence of a medium like radio and of a newspaper in the native language. He decided to publish a Kannada newspaper with the intention of spreading news items to the public. He decided to name it as \"Mangaluura samaachaara\" and its first issue rolled out on 1 July 1843. Thereafter it was published fortnightly and contained 4 pages. The paper was printed using stone slabs. Some of the news items covered were local Mangalore-related news, Indian population, news related to the East India Company and its laws and regulations. Even songs of Purandaradasa and moral stories were also printed. There are conflicting reports on whether this newspaper was used by Mögling as a tool for proselytisation or not. The newspaper became popular and it was decided to shift its publication to the city of Bellary where it was renamed as \"Karnataka Samachara\". \"Karnataka Samachara\" was first released on 1 May 1844 and in fact it was the 15th issue of \"Mangalooru Samachara\". \"Karnataka Samachara\" was the first Kannada newspaper to be printed using movable type. Unfortunately, only three issues of \"Karnataka Samachara\" were released. Mögling is credited to be one of the visionaries for a unified Karnataka. In his times, not much communication used to happen between the north and south regions of present-day Karnataka though the people in these two regions spoke the same language, Kannada. In the last issue of \"Karnataka Samachara\", he talks of a \"Samagra Karnataka\" (\"Unified Karnataka\") which is essentially a union of these different regions.\n\nMögling's main job as a missionary of Basel Mission was the spread of Christianity. One of his converts by name Anandaraya Kaundinya and his family have exchanged letters with Mögling which he has published under the title \"Iraaru patragalu\" (Twelve letters). This was the first collection of letters ever published in Kannada. Even during his stay in Kodagu district during the years (1853–1858) he spent much of his time on proselytisation. He also published a German book titled \"Das Kurgland\" which mainly deals with his activities related to Christianity.\n\nIn 1848, Mögling started dealing with Kannada literature by publishing a list of more than 3000 Kannada proverbs. He also composed about 20 poems (along with Weigle who was his cousin brother and a fellow Basel Missionary) in modern Kannada poetical form. This makes him a pioneer of modern Kannada poetry. But his most important contribution to the Kannada literature is regarded as the \"Bibliotheca Carnataca\", a six-volume collection of traditional Kannada literary texts, including the songs of Basavanna, an early Lingayat poet; \"Bibliotheca Carnataca\" as a collection of Kannada classics was edited and published by him between the period 1848–1853. Mögling was helped in this venture by a philanthropist, \"J Casamajor\" who was a retired judge from Chennai and settled in Nilgiris. With an exchange of letters, the two discussed on ways to collect Kannada manuscripts, select the important ones among them for publishing and identifying skilled people who would be needed to complete this activity. Casamajor agreed to bear all the expenses required for this venture and was very particular that his name should not be mentioned in any of the publications. A total of eight titles were brought out, the first one being the \"Ravana digvijaya – Yakshagana Prasanga\" (the victory of Ravana, based on a scene from Yakshagana). The largest published title running 760 pages was the Basava Purana and the smallest one was Kanakadasa's \"Haribhaktasara\". Other titles published as a part of \"Bibliotheca Carnataca\" were \"Dasara Padagalu\" (a collection of 170 Haridasa songs) and Lakshmisha's \"Jaimini Bharata\". This venture met an abrupt end due to the sudden demise of Casamajor and Mögling's return to Germany.\n\nDuring his stay in Kodagu, Mögling also published the German book \"Das Kurgland\" and also a Kannada book titled \"Raajendranaame\" at the behest of the Kodagu king, Senior Virarajendra. The whole book \"Raajendraname\" was printed using a simpler orthographic form invented by Mögling himself. The Kannada language uses double consonants frequently, which Mögling felt was difficult for children to learn easily and also to print (since a blank line between two print lines was necessitated to print the double consonant). Mögling devised a scheme of accommodating the double consonant in the same single line by breaking the double consonant into a half consonant wherever possible. After getting an approval for his scheme from the Madras Province's Education Department, Mögling published this entire book in his devised orthography. He also published a book called \"Coorg Memoirs\" which is supposedly one of the earliest history books on Karnataka. In this book, he has described the social life of Kodavas and their customs as well.\n\nOn his return to Germany, he translated 24 songs of Kanakadasa and Purandaradasa to the German language which were published by Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, an Oriental society in Germany. In 1870, he also translated the first two chapters (67 verses) of \"Bibliotheca Carnataca\"'s \"Jaimini Bharata\" into German.\n\nPilgrims Progress was published in Kannada by Moegling and Weigle in 1848\n\nHermann Moegling was the founder-principal of the BEM Theological Seminary, established in 1847 by the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society. This seminary was established to train Pastors for the Protestant churches in Karnataka and Malabar areas. In 1965, BEM Theological Seminary was merged with Union Kanarese Seminary at Tumkur and renamed as present Karnataka Theological College.\n\nIn 1852, Rev. Mögling was getting ready to go back to Germany, when he was met by Alamanda Somayya from Coorg, who wanted to convert to Christianity and also invited him to Coorg, offering his land for construction of a church in Coorg. Rev. Mögling cancelled his plans to return to Germany, and instead moved to Coorg along with his junior Rev. Anand Rao Kaundinya in 1853. On 6 January 1853, Alamanda Somayya was baptised into Christianity, taking up the name of Stephanas Somayya. A modest church was built on Somayya's land. The then Chief Commissioner of Coorg,\nLt Col Mark Cubbon, helped Rev. Mögling to set up Coorg's first Protestant church and a school in Mercara in 1855. Further in 1857, the British administration granted Rev. Mögling 97 acres land to establish a church and a coffee estate settlement.\n\nIn spite of his busy schedule in Coorg, Rev. Mögling managed to write two books on Coorg. One in German, called Das Kurgland, detailing evangelical work in Coorg, and the other in English, called Coorg Memoirs, an in depth study of the history of Coorg. Rev. Mögling was very much fond of Coorg and used to call it his second home. He left Coorg in 1860, to be with his ailing wife in Germany.\n\nWhen his cousin Gottfried Weigle died in 1855, Mögling (at a late age of 45) married Weigle's wife Pauline. This marriage also gave Mögling four stepchildren from Pauline's earlier marriage. One last contribution to Kannada from him was his interest in coming up with a Kannada – English dictionary. He motivated the British in this project and also suggested the name of Ferdinand Kittel as the ideal person to head the project. Mögling died in 1881 and his memorial is in Esslingen.\n\n\n"}

When the people near the speaker respond \"mic check\", the speaker knows they have the group's attention. The speaker says a short phrase, part of a speech, and then pauses. Those that can hear what the speaker has said repeat the phrase in unison, and when finished, the speaker says another phrase, then pauses again waiting for a response, etc., until the speaker's speech is complete..\n\nIf the entire gathering still cannot hear the speaker, organizers ask for additional repetitions by those at the limit of earshot. For large gatherings, this may require two or three waves of repetition.\n\n The use of electronic amplification devices, such as loudspeakers or bullhorns, may require permits for \"amplified sound\". The use of human microphones provides a way for people to address large gatherings without running afoul of such requirements. The human microphone was first used in the anti-nuclear protests in the United States and later in the 1999 Seattle WTO protests.\n\nThis method of communication attracted attention due to its use by Occupy Wall Street.

However, by putting RF energy outside of the normally-defined channel, interference to adjacent channel stations is increased when using digital sidebands. The addition of the digital sidebands works better in the United States, where the FM broadcast band channels have a spacing of 200 kHz, as opposed to the 100 kHz that is normal elsewhere. The 200 kHz spacing means that in practice, stations having concurrent or adjacent coverage areas will not be spaced at less than 400 kHz. Outside of the US, spacing can be 300 kHz, which causes problems with the IBOC digital sidebands.\n\nIBOC does allow for multiple program channels, though this can entail taking some existing subcarriers off the air to make additional bandwidth available in the modulation baseband. On FM, this could eventually mean removing stereo. On AM, IBOC is incompatible with analog stereo, and any additional channels are limited to highly compressed voice, such as traffic and weather. Eventually, stations can go from hybrid mode (both analog and digital) to all-digital, by eliminating the baseband monophonic audio.\n\nOn FM there are currently three methods of IBOC broadcasting in use, mainly in the United States.\n\nThe first, and currently only, digital technology approved for use on AM and FM broadcast frequencies by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, is the proprietary HD Radio system developed by iBiquity Digital Corporation, which transmits energy beyond the allotted ±100 kHz FM channel. This creates potential interference issues with adjacent channels. This is the most widespread system in use, with approximately 1,556 stations transmitting HD radio in the US, plus over 800 new multicast channels (as of Jan 2010). There is a one-time license fee to iBiquity Digital, for the use of its intellectual property, as well as costs for new equipment which range from $50,000 to $100,000 US (2010) per station.\n\nThe other system is FMeXtra by Digital Radio Express, which instead uses subcarriers within the existing signal. This system was introduced more recently. The system is compatible with HD Radio in hybrid mode, but not in all-digital mode, and with RBDS. The stereo subcarrier can be removed to make more space available for FMeXtra in the modulation baseband. However, the system is not compatible with other existing 67–92 kHz subcarriers which have mostly fallen into disuse. The system is far less expensive and less complicated to implement, needing only to be plugged into the existing exciter, and requiring no licensing fees. FMeXtra has generally all the user features of HD Radio, including multicast capability; the ability to broadcast several different audio programs simultaneously. It uses the aacPlus (HE-AAC) codec.\n\nFMeXtra can control listening with conditional access and encryption.\n\nDigital Radio Mondiale allows for simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams alongside an audio signal. The DRM mode for VHF provides bandwidths from between 35 kbit/s to 185 kbit/s and up to four simultaneous data streams, allowing 5.1 surround DVD quality audio to be broadcast alongside other multimedia content - images, video or HTML content are typical examples.\n\nWhile it is not backwardly compatible with existing FM receiver equipment, with broadcasts digitally encoded using HE-AAC or xHE-AAC, this ability to operate within the internationally agreed FM spectrum of 88-108 MHz makes DRM a viable candidate for future adoption when countries begin to switch off their analogue broadcasts.\n\niBiquity also created a mediumwave HD Radio system for AM, which is the only system approved by the Federal Communications Commission for digital AM broadcasting in the United States. The HD Radio system employs use of injected digital sidebands above and below the audible portion of the analog audio on the primary carrier. This system also phase modulates the carrier in quadrature and injects more digital information on this phase-modulated portion of the carrier. It is based on the principle of AM stereo where it puts a digital signal where the C-QUAM system would put the analog stereo decoding information.\n\nDigital Radio Mondiale has had much more success in creating an AM system, and one that could be much less expensive to implement than any proprietary HD Radio system, although it requires new frequency. It is the only one to have been accepted mediumwave but also shortwave (and possibly longwave) by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for use in regions I and III, but not yet in region II, the Americas. The HD Radio system has also been approved by International Telecommunication Union.\n\nCAM-D is yet another method, though it is more of an extension of the current system. Developed by AM stereo pioneer Leonard R. Kahn, It encodes the treble on very small digital sidebands which do not cause interference to adjacent channels, and mixes it back with the analog baseband. Unlike the other two, it is not intended to be capable of multichannel, opting for quality over quantity. Unlike the HD system iBiquity calls \"hybrid digital\" the CAM-D system truly is a direct hybrid of both analog and digital. Some engineers believe that CAM-D may be compatible with analog AM stereo with the right engineering.\n\nCritics of CAM-D point to several drawbacks:\n\nWhile the United Kingdom has chosen the Eureka 147 standard of digital audio broadcasting (DAB) for creating a digital radio service, the United States has selected IBOC technology for its digital AM and FM stations. The band used for terrestrial DAB in the UK is part of VHF band III, which does not suffer from L-band's significant line-of-sight problems. However, it is not available in North America since that span is occupied by TV channels 7 to 13 and the amateur radio 1.25 meter (222 MHz) band. The stations currently occupying that spectrum did not wish to give up their space, since VHF offers several benefits over UHF: relatively lower power, long distance propagation (up to 100 miles (160 km) with a rooftop antenna), and a longer wavelength that is more robust and less affected by interference. In Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is continuing to follow the analog standard, so the channels remain unavailable there as well. HD Radio testing has been authorized in Canada, as well as other countries around the world.\n\nThere was also concern that AM and FM stations' branding, using their current frequencies, would be lost to new channel numbers, though virtual channels such as on digital television would eliminate this. Also, several competing stations would have to share a transmitter that multiplexes them all into one ensemble with the same coverage area (though many FM stations are already diplexed in large cities such as New York). A further concern to FM station operators was that AM stations could suddenly be in competition with the same high audio quality, although FM would still have the advantage of higher data rates (300 kbit/s versus 60 kbit/s in the HD Radio standard) due to greater bandwidth (100 kHz versus 10 kHz).\n\nThe most significant advantage for IBOC is its relative ease of implementation. Existing analog radios are not rendered obsolete and the consumer and industry may transition to digital at a rational pace. In addition, the technology infrastructure is in place: most major broadcast equipment manufacturers are implementing IBOC technology and 60+ receiver manufacturers are selling IBOC reception devices. In the UK, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland, which are the leading countries with regard to implementing DAB, the first-generation MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2) codec stereo radio stations on DAB have a lower sound-quality than FM, prompting a number of complaints. The typical bandwidth for DAB programs is only 128 kbit/s using the first generation CODEC, the less-robust MP2 standard which requires at least \"double\" that rate to be considered near-CD quality.\n\nA new version of the Eureka-147 standard called DAB+ has been implemented. Using the more efficient high quality MPEG-4 CODEC called HE-AAC v2, this compression method will allow the DAB+ system to carry more channels or have better sound quality at the same bit rate as the old DAB system. It is the new DAB+ implementation which will be under consideration for new station designs and not the earlier DAB scheme using the MUSICAM CODEC. This new DAB+ system was coordinated and developed by the World DAB Forum, formed in 1997 from the old organization. It will give the Eureka-147 system a similar quality per bit rate as the IBOC system and hence a better sound quality than FM.\n\nAM IBOC in the United States still faces some serious technological challenges of its own, including nighttime interference with other stations. iBiquity was previously using PAC (also used at a higher bitrate in Sirius satellite radio, see Digital Audio Radio Service), but in August 2003 a switch to HDC (based-upon ACC) was made to rectify these problems. HDC has been customized for IBOC, and it is also likely that the patent rights and royalties for every transmitter and receiver can be retained longer by creating a more proprietary system. Digital Radio Mondiale is also developing an IBOC system, likely to be used worldwide with AM shortwave radio, and possibly with broadcast AM and FM. Neither of those have been approved yet for ITU region 2 (the Americas). The system, however, unlike HD Radio, does not permit the existing analog signal and the digital signal to live together in the same channel. DRM requires an additional channel to maintain both signals.\n\nBoth AM and FM IBOC signals cause interference to adjacent-channel stations, but not within the station’s interference-free protected contours designated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). It has led to derogatory terms such as IBAC (In-band adjacent-channel) and IBUZ (since the interference sounds like a buzz.) The range of a station on an HD Radio receiver is somewhat less than its analog signal. However, in June, 2008, a group of US broadcasters and equipment manufacturers requested that the U.S. FCC increase the permissible FM IBOC power from 1% (currently) to a maximum of 10% of the analog power. On January 29, 2010, the FCC approved the request. In addition, tropospheric ducting and e-skip can reduce the range of the digital signal, as well as the analog.\n\nIn-band on-channel digital radios using iBiquity's standard are being marketed under the brand \"HD Radio\" to highlight the purported quality of reception. As of June 2008, over 60 different receiver models have been made, and stations have received blanket (no longer individual and experimental) authorization from the U.S. FCC to transmit in a multiplexed multichannel mode on FM. Originally, the use of HD Radio transmission on AM was limited to daytime only, and not allowed at night due to potential problems with skywave radio propagation. The FCC lifted this restriction in early 2007. DRM, however, is being used across Europe on shortwave, which is entirely AM skywave, without issue. With the proper receiver, many of those stations can be heard in North America as well, sans the analog signal.\n\nHD Radio technology was tested in 2004 with initial trials in Buenos Aires. Further testing of the technology began in early 2007.\n\nGovernment broadcaster BETAR began broadcasting HD Radio on their 100.0 MHz frequency on 9 November 2016 from their Agargaon site in Dhaka. The transmission uses a 10 kW GatesAir system. The 100.0 MHz carries programs from BBC World Service amongst others. HD 1, 2, 3 and 4 are configured. A second transmission will also have HD radio added on 88.8 MHz from the same site.\n\nTrial and tests of HD Radio technology began in Sarajevo in March 2007.\n\nHD Radio and DRM trials in Brazil started in the mid 2000s. No regular HD Radio or DRM transmissions are allowed in Brazil as the digital radio standard in that country is not yet defined. One or two year experimental licenses were given to some Broadcasters. A joint study by the government (Ministry of Communications and ANATEL) and the National Metrology Institute (Inmetro) was done and the Digital Radio Consultative Council concluded that HD Radio and DRM do not meet the same analog transmission coverage with 20db less power. New trials are expected to occur before any decision about the Brazilian Digital Radio standard. Brazil is considering for adoption Digital Radio Mondiale or HD Radio.\n\nAfter having L-band DAB for several years, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) have also looked at the use of HD Radio, given its gradual progress in the neighbouring U.S. The CBC began HD Radio testing in September 2006, focusing on transmissions from Toronto and Peterborough, Ontario. The CRTC has since revised its policy on digital radio to allow HD Radio operations.\n\nInitial testing of the HD Radio system commenced in Prague in February 2007.\n\nIn China, Hunan Broadcasting Company started FMeXtra transmissions in Changsha in April 2007, and plans to put others throughout the Hunan province. SARFT (State Administration for Radio, Film and Television) is currently testing HD Radio in Beijing in contemplation for acceptance in that country.\n\nCaracol Radio began testing of the HD Radio technology in both the AM and FM bands in early 2008.\n\nEl Salvador will be choosing HD Radio as its digital radio standard.\n\nIn September 2007 the European HD Radio Alliance (EHDRA) was formed by broadcasters and other interested groups to promote the adoption of HD Radio technology by European broadcasters, regulators and standards organizations.\n\nFrance began broadcasting an HD Radio signal in March 2006 and plans to multicast two or more channels. The radio stations that use IBOC HD in France are SIRTI and NRJ Group. The owner of the transmitter is Towercast. The frequency of IBOC HD radio is 88.2 MHz. In May 2006, The Towercast group added a single channel of digital audio on 93.9 MHz.\n\nRadio Regenbogen began HD Radio operations on 102.8 MHz in Heidelberg on December 3, 2007 pursuant to government testing authority.\n\nForum Radio Jaringan Indonesia had tested IBOC HD transmission from March 2006 to May 2006. The IBOC HD station in Jakarta was Delta FM (99.1 MHz). In April 2006, Radio Sangkakala (in Surabaya), the first AM HD radio station in Asia, went on the air on 1062 kHz.\n\nRadio Jamaica began operating full-time with both HD Radio AM and FM signals in the city of Kingston in 2008.\n\nAll Mexican radio stations within 320 km of the U.S. border are allowed to transmit their programs on the AM and FM bands utilizing HD Radio technology. Approximately six Mexican AM and FM stations are already operating with HD Radio technology along Mexico’s border area with the US. Grupo Imagen commenced HD Radio transmissions on XHDL-FM and XEDA-FM as well as Instituto Mexicano de la Radio on XHIMR-FM, XHIMER-FM and XHOF-FM in Mexico City in June 2012.\n\nHD Radio transmission in Auckland, New Zealand was started on October 19, 2005. The frequency of IBOC HD radio is 106.1 MHz. The transmitter is located at Skytower. Following successful testing, the Radio Broadcasters Association (RBA) initiated a comprehensive trial of HD Radio technology in December 2006. The aim of the trial was to assess the coverage potential of the HD Radio system and to make a recommendation on the suitability of the technology for adoption.\n\nThe first HD Radio station in the Philippines began broadcasting on November 9, 2005. The Philippines National Telecommunications Commission finalized its rules for FM digital radio operations on November 11, 2007.\n\nAn HD Radio trial began in Warsaw in 2006 in order to demonstrate the technology to local radio stations.\n\nWPRM FM is the first station in San Juan, Puerto Rico (part of the US) to adopt HD Radio, in April 2005. WRTU in San Juan has also commenced broadcasting in HD Radio technology in 2007.\n\nFM testing sponsored by Radio Sunshine and Ruoss AG began in Lucerne in April 2006. HD Radio operations in Switzerland continue and are spotlighted each year during “HD Radio Days”, an annual gathering in Lucerne of European broadcasters and manufacturers for the purpose of discussing the rollout of the technology in Europe.\n\nRadio Sunshine has now switched to DAB+ \ndue to the high penetration of DAB+ and lack of interest in HD Radio.\nDAB+ penetration in Switzerland has now reached 99.5% as of 2018.\n\nHD Radio transmission in Thailand was started in April 2006. Radio of Thailand had created a public IBOC HD radio network targeting mass transit commuters in Thailand's capital of Bangkok. To receive the broadcasts, more than 10,000 HD Radio receivers were installed in buses.\n\nThe first FM HD Radio broadcasts in Kiev went on the air in October 2006 on two FM stations operated by the First Ukrainian Radio Group.\n\nVoice of Vietnam (VOV) commenced AM and FM HD Radio transmissions in Hanoi in June, 2008 including multicasting, in anticipation of making HD Radio technology a standard.\n\nAs of June 2008, more than 1,700 HD Radio stations were broadcasting 2,432 HD Radio channels. HD Radio technology is the only digital technology approved by the FCC for digital AM and FM broadcasting in the US. Over 60 different HD Radio receivers are on sale in over 12,000 stores nationwide, including Apple, Best Buy, Target, and Wal-Mart.\n\nAs of May 2007, FMeXtra is on several dozen stations. Several hundred stations belonging to the Idea Bank consortium will also have FMeXtra installed. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "6427405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6427405", "title": "Indeterminacy (philosophy)", "text": "Indeterminacy (philosophy)\n\nIndeterminacy, in philosophy, can refer both to common scientific and mathematical concepts of uncertainty and their implications and to another kind of indeterminacy deriving from the nature of definition or meaning. It is related to deconstructionism and to Nietzsche's criticism of the Kantian noumenon.\n\nThe problem of indeterminacy arises when one observes the eventual circularity of virtually every possible definition. It is easy to find loops of definition in any dictionary, because this seems to be the only way that certain concepts, and generally very important ones such as that of existence, can be defined in the English language. A definition is a collection of other words, and in any finite dictionary if one continues to follow the trail of words in search of the precise meaning of any given term, one will inevitably encounter this linguistic indeterminacy.\n\nPhilosophers and scientists generally try to eliminate indeterminate terms from their arguments, since any indeterminate thing is unquantifiable and untestable; similarly, any hypothesis which consists of a statement of the properties of something unquantifiable or indefinable cannot be falsified and thus cannot be said to be supported by evidence that does not falsify it. This is related to Popper's discussions of falsifiability in his works on the scientific method. The quantifiability of data collected during an experiment is central to the scientific method, since reliable conclusions can only be drawn from replicable experiments, and since in order to establish observer agreement scientists must be able to quantify experimental evidence.\n\nImmanuel Kant unwittingly proposed one answer to this question in his Critique of Pure Reason by stating that there must \"exist\" a \"thing in itself\" – a thing which is the cause of phenomena, but not a phenomenon itself. But, so to speak, \"approximations\" of \"things in themselves\" crop up in many models of empirical phenomena. Singularities in physics, such as gravitational singularities, \"certain aspects of which\" (e.g., their unquantifiability) can seem \"almost\" to mirror various \"aspects\" of the proposed \"thing in itself\", are generally eliminated (or attempts are made at eliminating them) in newer, more precise models of the universe. Definitions of various psychiatric disorders stem, according to philosophers who draw on the work of Michel Foucault, from a belief that something unobservable and indescribable is fundamentally \"wrong\" with the mind of whoever suffers from such a disorder. Proponents of Foucault's treatment of the concept of insanity would assert that one need only try to quantify various characteristics of such disorders as presented in today's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (e.g., delusion, one of the diagnostic criteria which must be exhibited by a patient if he or she is to be considered schizophrenic) in order to discover that the field of study known as abnormal psychology relies upon indeterminate concepts in defining virtually each \"mental disorder\" it describes. The quality that makes a belief a delusion is indeterminate to the extent to which it is unquantifiable; arguments that delusion is determined by popular sentiment (i.e., \"almost no-one believes that he or she is made of cheese, and thus that belief is a delusion\") would lead to the conclusion that, for example, Alfred Wegener's assertion of continental drift was a delusion since it was dismissed for decades after it was made.\n\nRelevant criticism of Kant's original formulation of the \"thing in itself\" can be found in the works of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, who argued against what he held to be the indeterminate nature of such concepts as the Platonic idea, the subject, the Kantian noumenon, the opposition of \"appearance\" to \"reality\", etc. Nietzsche concisely argued against Kant's noumenon in his \"On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\" as follows:\n\nIn his \"Beyond Good and Evil\", Nietzsche argues against the \"misleading significance of words\" and its production of a \"thing in itself\":\n\nFurthermore, Nietzsche argued against such singularities as the atom in the scientific models of his day in \"The Will to Power\":\n\nThe concept of something that is unapproachable but always further-approximable has led to a rejection by philosophers like Nietzsche of the concept of exact equality in general in favor of that of approximate similarity:\n\nIf one states an equation between two things, one states, in effect, that they are the same thing. It can be argued that this cannot possibly be true, since one will then consider the properties which the two sides of the equation share – that which makes them \"equal\" – but one also can, and does, consider them as two separate concepts. Even in a mathematical statement as simple as \"x=x\", one encounters fundamental differences between the two \"x\"es under consideration: firstly, that there are two distinct \"x\"es, in that they neither occupy the same space on this page nor in one's own mind. There would otherwise be only one \"x\". Secondly, that if two things were absolutely equal in every possible respect, then there would necessarily be no reason to consider their equality. Nothing could lead anyone to consider the possibility or impossibility of their equality if there were no properties \"not\" shared between \"them\", since there would necessarily be no relationship between them whatsoever. Thirdly, and most importantly, if two things were equal in every possible respect they would necessarily not be two things, but the very same thing, since there would be no difference to separate them.\n\nIn examples as odd as this, the differences between two approximately equal things may be very small indeed, and it is certainly true that they are quite irrelevant to most discussions. Acceptance of the reflexive property illustrated above has led to useful mathematical discoveries which have influenced the life of anyone reading this article on a computer. But in an examination of the possibility of the determinacy of any possible concept, differences like this are supremely relevant since that quality which could possibly make two separate things \"equal\" seems to be indeterminate.\n\nSee:\n\nIndeterminacy was discussed in one of Jacques Derrida's early works \"Plato's Pharmacy\" (1969), a reading of Plato's \"Phaedrus\" and \"Phaedo\". Plato writes of a fictionalized conversation between Socrates and a student, in which Socrates tries to convince the student that writing is inferior to speech. Socrates uses the Egyptian myth of Thoth's creation of writing to illustrate his point. As the story goes, Thoth presents his invention to the god-king of Upper Egypt for judgment. Upon its presentation, Thoth offers script as a \"pharmakon\" for the Egyptian people. The Greek word pharmakon poses a quandary for translators: it is both a remedy and a poison. In the proffering of a pharmakon, Thoth presents it as its true meaning: a harm and benefit. The god-king, however, refuses the invention. Through various reasonings, he determines the pharmakon of writing to be a bad thing for the Egyptian people. The pharmakon, the undecidable, has been returned decided. The problem, as Derrida reasons, is this: since the word pharmakon, in the original Greek, means both a remedy and a poison, it cannot be determined as fully remedy or fully poison. Amon rejected writing as fully poison in Socrates' retelling of the tale, thus shutting out the other possibilities.\n\nThe philosopher Michel Foucault wrote about the existence of such problems of precise definition in the very concept of insanity itself – a \"very\" rough approximation of his argument can be found in the late social commentator and journalist Hunter S. Thompson's book, \"Kingdom of Fear\":\n\n\"The only difference between the Sane and the Insane, is IN and yet within this world, the Sane have the power to have the Insane locked up.\"\n\nAnother summary of Foucault's original argument against the indeterminacy of the concept of insanity in his \"Madness and Civilization\" can be found in the following excerpt from the \"Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database\":\n\n\"Central to this is the notion of confinement as a meaningful exercise. Foucault's history explains how the mad came first to be confined; how they became identified as confined due to moral and economic factors that determined those who ought to be confined; how they became perceived as dangerous through their confinement, partly by way of atavistic identification with the lepers whose place they had come to occupy; how they were 'liberated' by Pinel and Tuke, but in their liberation remained confined, both physically in asylums and in the designation of being mad; and how this confinement subsequently became enacted in the figure of the psychiatrist, whose practice is 'a certain moral tactic contemporary with the end of the eighteenth century, preserved in the rites of the asylum life, and overlaid by the myths of positivism.' Science and medicine, notably, come in at the later stages, as practices 'elaborated once this division' between the mad and the sane has been made (ix).\"\n\nIn \"The Archaeology of Knowledge\", Foucault addresses indeterminacy directly by discussing the origin of the meaning of concepts:\n\n\"Foucault directs his analysis toward the 'statement', the basic unit of discourse that he believes has been ignored up to this point. 'Statement' is the English translation from French énoncé (that which is enunciated or expressed), which has a peculiar meaning for Foucault. 'Énoncé' for Foucault means that which makes propositions, utterances, or speech acts meaningful. In this understanding, statements themselves are not propositions, utterances, or speech acts. Rather, statements create a network of rules establishing what is meaningful, and it is these rules that are the preconditions for propositions, utterances, or speech acts to have meaning. Statements are also 'events'. Depending on whether or not they comply with the rules of meaning, a grammatically correct sentence may still lack meaning and inversely, an incorrect sentence may still be meaningful. Statements depend on the conditions in which they emerge and exist within a field of discourse. It is huge collections of statements, called discursive formations, toward which Foucault aims his analysis.\nRather than looking for a deeper meaning underneath discourse or looking for the source of meaning in some transcendental subject, Foucault analyzes the conditions of existence for meaning. In order to show the principles of meaning production in various discursive formations he details how truth claims emerge during various epochs on the basis of what was actually said and written during these periods of time.\"\n\nThe difference described by Foucault between the sane and the insane does have observable and very real effects on millions of people daily and can be characterized in terms of those effects, but it can also serve to illustrate a particular effect of the indeterminacy of definition: i.e., that insofar as the general public tends not to characterize or define insanity in very precise terms, it tends, according to Foucault, unnecessarily and arbitrarily to confine some of its members on an irrational basis. The less-precisely such states as \"insanity\" and \"criminality\" are defined in a society, the more likely that society is to fail to continue over time to describe the same behaviors as characteristic of those states (or, alternately, to characterize such states in terms of the same behaviors).\n\nSteve Hoenisch asserts in his article \"Interpretation and Indeterminacy in Discourse Analysis\" that \"[T]he exact meaning of a speaker's utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate. Within the context of the analysis of the teacher-pupil exchange, I will argue for the superiority of interactional linguistics over speech act theory because it reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled interpretation[...]\".\n\nRichard Dawkins, the man who coined the term meme in the 1970s, described the concept of faith in his documentary, \"Root of All Evil?\", as \"the process of non-thinking\". In the documentary, he used Bertrand Russell's analogy between a teapot orbiting the sun (something that cannot be observed because the brightness of the sun would obscure it even from the best telescope's view) and the object of one's faith (in this particular case, God) to explain that a highly indeterminate idea can self-replicate freely: \"Everybody in the society had faith in the teapot. Stories of the teapot had been handed down for generations as part of the tradition of society. There are holy books about the teapot.\"\n\nIn \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\", Daniel Dennett argues against the existence of determinate meaning (in this case, of the subjective experience of vision for frogs) via an explanation of their indeterminacy in the chapter entitled \"The Evolution of Meanings\", in the section \"The Quest for Real Meanings\":\n\n\"Unless there were 'meaningless' or 'indeterminate' variation in the triggering conditions of the various frogs' eyes, there could be no raw material [...] for selection for a \"new\" purpose to act upon. The indeterminacy that Fodor (and others) see as a flaw [...] is actually a prediction for such evolution [of \"purpose\"]. The idea that there must be \"something determinate\" that the frog's eye really means – some possibly unknowable proposition in froggish that expresses \"exactly\" what the frog's eye is telling the frog's brain – is just essentialism applied to meaning (or function). Meaning, like function on which it so directly depends, is not something determinate at its birth. [...]\"\n\nDennet argues, controversially, against qualia in \"Consciousness Explained\". Qualia are attacked from several directions at once: he maintains they do not exist (or that they are too ill-defined to play any role in science, or that they are really something else, i.e. behavioral dispositions). They cannot simultaneously have all the properties\nattributed to them by philosophers—incorrigible, ineffable, private, directly accessible and so on. The multiple drafts theory is leveraged to show that facts about qualia are not definite. Critics object that one's own qualia are subjectively quite clear and distinct to \"oneself\".\n\nThe self-replicating nature of memes is a partial explanation of the recurrence of indeterminacies in language and thought. The wide influences of Platonism and Kantianism in Western philosophy can arguably be partially attributed to the indeterminacies of some of their most fundamental concepts (namely, the Idea and the Noumenon, respectively).\n\nFor a given meme to exhibit replication and heritability – that is, for it to be able to make an \"imperfect copy\" of itself which is more likely to share any given trait with its \"parent\" meme than with some random member of the general \"population\" of memes – it must in some way be mutable, since memetic replication occurs by means of human conceptual imitation rather than via the discrete molecular processes that govern genetic replication. (If a statement were to generate copies of itself \"that didn't meaningfully differ from it\", that process of copying would more accurately be described as \"duplication\" than as \"replication\", and it would be incorrect to term these statements \"memes\"; the same would be true if the \"child\" statements did \"not\" noticeably inherit a substantial proportion of their traits from their \"parent\" statements.)\nIn other words, if a meme is defined roughly (and somewhat arbitrarily) as a statement (or as a collection of statements, like Foucault's \"discursive formations\") that inherits \"some\", but not \"all\", of its properties (or elements of its definition) from its \"parent\" memes and which self-replicates, then indeterminacy of definition could be seen as \"advantageous\" to memetic replication, since an absolute rigidity of definition would preclude memetic adaptation.\n\nIt is important to note that indeterminacy in linguistics can arguably partially be defeated by the fact that languages are always changing. However, what the entire language and its collected changes continue to reflect is sometimes still considered to be indeterminate.\n\nPersons of faith argue that faith \"is the basis of all knowledge\". The Wikipedia article on faith states that \"one must assume, believe, or have \"faith\" in the credibility of a person, place, thing, or idea in order to have a basis for knowledge.\" In this way the object of one's faith is similar to Kant's noumenon.\n\nThis would seem to attempt to make direct use of the indeterminacy of the object of one's faith as evidential support of its existence: if the object of one's faith were to be proven to exist (i.e., if it were no longer of indeterminate definition, or if it were no longer unquantifiable, etc.), then faith in that object would no longer be necessary; arguments from authority such as those mentioned above wouldn't either; all that would be needed to prove its existence would be scientific evidence. Thus, if faith is to be considered as a reliable basis for knowledge, persons of faith would seem, in effect, to assert that indeterminacy is not only necessary, but good (see Nassim Taleb).\n\nScience generally attempts to eliminate vague definitions, causally inert entities, and indeterminate properties, via further observation, experimentation, characterization, and explanation. Occam's razor tends to eliminate causally inert entities from functioning models of quantifiable phenomena, but some quantitative models, such as quantum mechanics, actually imply certain indeterminacies, such as the relative indeterminacy of quantum particles' positions to the precision with which their momenta can be measured (and vice versa). (See Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle.)\n\nOne ardent supporter of the possibility of a final unifying theory (and thus, arguably, of the possibility of the end of some current indeterminacies) in physics, Steven Weinberg, stated in an interview with PBS that:\n\n\"Sometimes [...] people say that surely there's no final theory because, after all, every time we've made a step toward unification or toward simplification we always find more and more complexity there. That just means we haven't found it yet. Physicists never thought they had the final theory.\"\n\nThe Wikipedia article on the possibility of such a \"theory of everything\" notes that\n\n\"Other possibilities which may frustrate the explanatory capacity of a TOE may include sensitivity to the boundary conditions of the universe, or the existence of mathematical chaos in its solutions, making its predictions precise, but useless.\"\n\nChaos theory argues that precise prediction of the behavior of complex systems becomes impossible because of the observer's inability to gather all necessary data.\n\nAs yet, it seems entirely possible that there shall never be any \"final theory\" of all phenomena, and that, rather, explanations may instead breed more and more complex and exact explanations of the new phenomena uncovered by current experimentation. In this argument, the \"indeterminacy\" or \"thing in itself\" is the \"final explanation\" that will never be reached; this can be compared to the concept of the limit in calculus, in that quantities may approach, but never reach, a given limit in certain situations.\n\nProponents of a deterministic universe have criticised various applications of the concept of indeterminacy in the sciences; for instance, Einstein once stated that \"God does not play dice\" in a succinct (but now unpopular) argument against the theory of quantum indeterminacy, which states that the actions of particles of extremely low mass or energy are unpredictable because an observer's interaction with them changes either their positions or momenta. (The \"dice\" in Einstein's metaphor refer to the \"probabilities\" that these particles will behave in particular ways, which is how quantum mechanics addressed the problem.)\n\nAt first it might seem that a criticism could be made from a biological standpoint in that an indeterminate idea would \"seem\" not to be beneficial to the species that holds it. A strong counterargument, however, is that not all traits exhibited by living organisms will be seen in the long term as evolutionarily advantageous, given that extinctions occur regularly and that phenotypic traits have often died out altogether – in other words, an indeterminate meme may in the long term demonstrate its evolutionary value to the species that produced it in \"either\" direction; humans are, as yet, the only species known to make use of such concepts.\nIt might also be argued that conceptual vagueness is an inevitability, given the limited capacity of the human nervous systems. We just do not have enough neurons to maintain separate concepts for \"dog with 1,000,000 hairs\", \"dog with 1,000,001 hairs\" and so on. But conceptual vagueness is not metaphysical indeterminacy.\n\nUncertainty and indeterminacy are words for essentially the same concept in both quantum mechanics. Unquantifiability, and undefinability (or indefinability), can also sometimes be synonymous with indeterminacy. In science, indeterminacy can sometimes be interchangeable with unprovability or unpredictability. Also, anything entirely inobservable can be said to be indeterminate in that it cannot be precisely characterized.\n"}
{"id": "15058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15058", "title": "International reply coupon", "text": "International reply coupon\n\nAn international reply coupon (IRC) is a coupon that can be exchanged for one or more postage stamps representing the minimum postage for an unregistered priority airmail letter of up to twenty grams sent to another Universal Postal Union (UPU) member country. IRCs are accepted by all UPU member countries.\n\nUPU member postal services are obliged to exchange an IRC for postage, but are not obliged to sell them.\n\nThe purpose of the IRC is to allow a person to send someone in another country a letter, along with the cost of postage for a reply. If the addressee is within the same country, there is no need for an IRC because a self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE) or return postcard will suffice; but if the addressee is in another country an IRC removes the necessity of acquiring foreign postage or sending appropriate currency.\n\nThe IRC was introduced in 1906 at a Universal Postal Union congress in Rome. At the time an IRC could be exchanged for a single-rate, ordinary postage stamp for surface delivery to a foreign country, as this was before the introduction of airmail services. An IRC is exchangeable in a UPU member country for the minimum postage of a priority or unregistered airmail letter to a foreign country.\n\nThe current IRC, which features the theme \"Water for Life,\" designed by Czech artist and graphic designer Michal Sindelar, was issued in 2013 and is valid until 31 December 2017. A new design by Vietnamese artist Nguyen Du for 2017-2021 was adopted in Istanbul in 2016. \n\nIRCs are ordered from the UPU headquarters in Bern, Switzerland by postal authorities. They are generally available at large post offices; in the U.S., they were requisitioned along with regular domestic stamps by any post office that had sufficient demand for them.\n\nPrices for IRCs vary by country. In the United States in November 2012, the purchase price was $2.20 USD; however, the US Postal Service discontinued sales of IRCs on 27 January 2013 due to declining demand. Britain's Royal Mail also stopped selling IRCs on 18 February 2012, citing minimal sales and claiming that the average post office sold less than one IRC per year. IRCs purchased in foreign countries may be used in the United States toward the purchase of postage stamps and embossed stamped envelopes at the current one-ounce First Class International rate ($1.05 USD as of April 2012) per coupon.\n\nIRCs are often used by amateur radio operators sending QSL cards to each other; it has traditionally been considered good practice and common courtesy to include an IRC when writing to a foreign operator and expecting a reply by mail. If the operator's home country does not sell IRCs, then a foreign IRC may be used.\n\nPrevious editions of the IRC, the \"Beijing\" model and all subsequent versions, bear an expiration date. Consequently, a new IRC will be issued every three years.\n\nInternational reply coupons are sold by the HongKong Post for 19 HKD as of 2018-10-19. \nInternational reply coupons are sold by the Swiss Post in packs of 10 for 25 CHF. \nThe Royal Mail stopped selling IRCs on 31 December 2011 due to a lack of demand.\n</ref>\n\nIn 1920, Charles Ponzi made use of the idea that profit could be made by taking advantage of the differing postal rates in different countries to buy IRCs cheaply in one country and exchange them for stamps of a higher value in another country. This subsequently became the fraudulent Ponzi scheme. In practice, the overhead on buying and selling large numbers of the very low-value IRCs precluded any profitability.\n\nThe selling price and exchange value in stamps in each country have been adjusted to some extent to remove some of the potential for profit, but ongoing fluctuations in currency value and exchange rates make it impossible to achieve this completely, as long as stamps represent a specific currency value, instead of acting as vouchers granting specific postal services, devoid of currency nomination.\n\nInternational reply coupons (in French, \"Coupons-Reponse Internationaux\") are printed in blue ink on paper that has the letters “UPU” in large characters in the watermark. The front of each coupon is printed in French. The reverse side of the coupon, which has text relating to its use, is printed in German, English, Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, and Russian. Under Universal Postal Union’s regulations, participating member countries are not required to place a control stamp or postmark on the international reply coupons that they sell. Therefore, some foreign issue reply coupons that are tendered for redemption may bear the name of the issuing country (generally in French) rather than the optional control stamp or postmark.\n\nThe Nairobi Model was an international reply coupon printed by the Universal Postal Union which is approximately 3.75 inches by 6 inches and had an expiration date of December 31, 2013. This model was designed by Rob Van Goor, a graphic artist from the Luxembourg Post. It was selected from among 10 designs presented by Universal Postal Union member countries. Van Goor interpreted the theme of the contest – \"The Postage Stamp: A Vehicle for Exchange\" – by depicting the world being cradled by a hand and the perforated outline of a postage stamp.\n\nThe Doha Model is named for the 25th UPU congress held in Doha, Qatar, in 2012. The Doha model, designed by Czech artist and graphic designer Michal Sindelar, shows cupped hands catching a stream of water, to celebrate the theme of Water for Life. It expires after December 31, 2017.\n\nThe Istanbul Model was designed by graphic artist Nguyen Du's and features a pair of hands and a dove against an Arctic backdrop to represent sustainable development in the postal sector. Ten countries participated in the competition which was held Oct. 7, 2016, during the UPU congress in Istanbul, Turkey. It expires after December 31, 2021.\n\nThe United States Postal Service stopped selling international reply coupons on January 27, 2013.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37731931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37731931", "title": "Japanese irregular verbs", "text": "Japanese irregular verbs\n\nJapanese verb conjugation is very regular, as is usual for an agglutinative language, but there are a number of exceptions. The best-known irregular verbs are the common verbs する \"suru\" \"do\" and 来る \"kuru\" \"come\", sometimes categorized as the two Group III verbs. As these are the only significantly irregular verbs, and the only verbs frequently flagged as irregular, it is sometimes incorrectly stated that these are the only irregular verbs in Japanese, but there are in fact more, about a dozen total, depending on how one counts. The other irregular verbs encountered at the beginning level are ある \"aru\" \"be (inanimate)\" and 行く \"iku/yuku\" \"go\", with the copula behaving similarly to an irregular verb.\n\nThere are also a few irregular adjectives, of which the most common and significant is 良い \"yoi\" \"good\".\n\nThe most significant irregular verbs are the verbs する \"suru\" \"do\" and 来る \"kuru\" \"come\", which are both very common and quite irregular. Often the conjugations behave as if they were instead the verb しる or す, or respectively きる or こる, where (other than す) these are vowel stem (\"Group II\", 1-row, monograde) conjugation (note that there are no \"-oru\" vowel stem verbs, though 来る sometimes behaves as if it were one), but beyond there are further exceptions. Historically する came from earlier す, which explains some of the irregularity. The following table is ordered to emphasize the regularities.\nThe irregular 〜ない \"-nai\" stem of する is often overlooked; it is used in grammatical forms where the 〜ない form is used without the 〜ない – generally formal – as in 食べず \"tabe-zu\" \"without eating\" or 食べんがため \"tabe-n ga tame\" \"for the purpose of eating\". In these contexts する becomes せ, as in せず \"se-zu\" \"without doing\" or せんがため \"se-n ga tame\" \"for the purpose of doing\". Note the similarity to 〜ません as the negative form of 〜ます, of the same origin.\n\nThe potential 来れる \"koreru\" form is from the omission of \"ra\" in the られる \"rareru\" potential form, and is found in all Group II verbs; it is considered an error by prescriptive grammarians, but is increasingly common, particularly in spoken speech and in younger Japanese.\n\nThe copula だ and です (polite), together with the verb ある \"aru\" \"be (inanimate)\", which is used grammatically, and the 〜ます suffix, which functions similarly to an irregular auxiliary verb, are all irregular to varying degrees, and particularly used in polite speech. It is debatable whether they should be classified as verbs or as different parts of speech.\n\nFormally, the copula is である \"de aru\". This form is normal in writing, but in spoken Japanese it is almost universally contracted to だ \"da\", or in some dialects じゃ \"ja\" or や \"ya\". When conjugated politely, である \"de aru\" becomes であります \"de arimasu\" following the regular transformation. This form is normal in writing, except that most writing either uses plain conjugations or the honorific forms, so in fact this form is not commonly seen. In spoken Japanese, であります \"de arimasu\" is universally contracted to です \"desu\".\n\n(*) indicates literary forms\n\n(**) じゃ \"ja\" is a dialectal spoken form of だ \"da\"\n\nThe 5 special polite verbs have the slight irregularity that 〜る \"-ru\" changes to 〜い \"-i\" in the \"-masu\" stem (continuative form, 連用形) and imperative stem (命令形), as opposed to the expected ×〜り *\"-ri\" and ×〜れ *\"-re\". As these all end in \"-aru,\" these can be termed \"\"aru\" special class\". The most commonly encountered of these is 〜ください, used for polite requests.\n\nA few short verbs have irregular euphonic form (音便形) in 〜て/〜た \"-te/-ta\" form, most significantly 行く \"iku/yuku\" \"go\":\nThese latter euphonic changes – \"-ott-\" → \"-out-\" (→ \"-ōt-\") – are regular in \"-te/-ta\" form in Kansai dialect, e.g., しまった \"shimatta\" \"done it; darn\" → しもうた \"shimōta,\" but only occur in the above exceptions in standard Japanese.\n\nNote that euphonic change also results in some conjugations being uniform across the language, but irregular compared with other verbs. Most significantly, the た \"ta\" and て \"te\" forms (perfective and participle/gerundive) of consonant stem verbs all exhibit euphonic sound change, except for す \"su\" verbs.\n\nThe volitional form, as in 読もう \"yomō\" and 食べよう \"tabeyō\", does not correspond to a verb stem ending in \"-o\" but is actually formed from the irrealis \"-a\" stem, with a euphonic change of \"a\" to \"o\" – for example \"yomu\" > \"yoma-u\" > \"yomou\" = \"yomō\". Thus the apparent volitional \"stem\" is not seen in other contexts.\n\nWhile 〜する \"suru\" verbs following a two-kanji compound are regular (using the admittedly irregular conjugation of \"suru\"), behaving as a kanji noun followed by an independent verb, there is irregular behavior for single kanji \"suru\" verbs, and they behave as a single fused word, with various forms and sometimes irregular conjugation.\n\nFirstly, these exhibit sound changes, which two-kanji \"suru\" verbs do not, yield these forms (non-exhaustive list):\n\nSecondly, the 〜る can be dropped (except from the 〜じる forms), corresponding to the earlier す form of する, yielding:\n\nFinally, the する／す／ず may be conjugated in various ways, particularly in less common forms. This is particularly noticeable for 愛する.\n\n\nFor a few verbs, the root of the verb changes depending on context. Most significantly, these are:\n\nSome verbs follow rules that are regular (in terms of the overall language), but relatively unusual or special. While not irregular per se, they present many of the same difficulties.\n\nVerbs ending in う \"-u\" have the unusual irrealis ending \"-wa,\" as in 買わない \"ka-wa-nai,\" from 買う \"ka-u.\" This is due to these traditionally having a \"w,\" but the [w] being lost except as わ \"wa\" (and in を \"(w)o\" following an ん \"n\").\n\nMost Japanese verbs are \"consonant stem\" (Group I, godan, \"u\" verb), though there is also the \"vowel stem\" category (Group II, ichidan, \"ru\" verb). All vowel stem verbs end in \"-iru\" or \"-eru,\" but not all verbs ending in \"-iru\" or \"-eru\" are vowel stem – some are instead consonant stem. Thus the conjugation type of a verb ending in \"-iru\" or \"-eru\" cannot be determined just from the dictionary form, and which verb is which must be memorized individually.\n\nThere are about a hundred such verbs with common examples being 知る \"shiru\" \"know\", 走る \"hashiru\" \"run\", 入る \"hairu\" \"enter\", and 帰る \"kaeru\" \"return\".\n\nThere are also homophone verbs that have either a vowel stem or a consonant stem; for example, 生きる \"ikiru\" \"live, stay alive\" and 寝る \"neru\" \"sleep\" have a vowel stem, but 熱る \"ikiru\" \"become sultry\" and 練る \"neru\" \"temper, refine, knead\" have a consonant stem.\n\n死ぬ \"shinu\" is the only ぬ \"-nu\" verb, and thus its conjugations are less familiar, but is otherwise regular. There used to be other ぬ \"-nu\" verbs, notably 往ぬ／去ぬ いぬ \"inu\" \"leave\".\n\nJapanese compound verbs are generally constructed using the \"masu\" stem form of the primary verb, as in 読み始める \"yomi-hajimeru\" \"begin to read\". In some cases compound verbs do not follow this pattern, generally due to sound change. Such exceptions include 振る舞う \"furu-mau\" \"behave, conduct; treat (to food or drink)\", from 振るう \"furuu\" + 舞う \"mau,\" instead of the regular ×振るい舞う *\"furui-mau\".\n\nThere are various abbreviations in Japanese, primarily of nouns or of inflections, such as 〜ている to 〜てる or 〜ておく to 〜とく, or even 〜ているの to 〜てん, though verb roots only rarely change. One such example is in the verb いらっしゃる, which has the following abbreviated forms:\n\nThe imperative form of the auxiliary verb 〜くれる \"-kureru\" is 〜くれ \"-kure,\" rather than the expected ×くれろ *\"kurero.\"\n\nJapanese adjectives, specifically \"i\"-adjectives, function grammatically as verbs, though with more limited conjugation. There are a few irregularities of note. Most significantly, 良い \"yoi\" \"good\" is generally replaced by \"ii\" in the base form (\"yoi\" is found in formal usage), though only \"yoi\" is used in conjugated forms such as 良く \"yoku\" and 良くない \"yokunai\".\n\nThere are more minor and subtler irregularities in certain constructions, particularly in adjectives with single-mora roots. In the \"-me\" form, adjectives can replace the \"-i\" with a 〜め \"-me\" (in kanji 〜目) to indicate \"somewhat\", as in 薄め \"usu-me\" \"somewhat watery, weak\" from 薄い \"usu-i\" \"watery, weak\". However, in some cases the \"-i\" is not dropped, notably 濃いめ \"ko-i-me\" \"somewhat strong (tea etc.)\", from 濃い \"ko-i.\"\n\nIn the \"-sugiru\" form, verbs and adjective attach a 〜すぎる \"-sugiru\" (in kanji 〜過ぎる) to the stem to indicate \"excessive\" – for example 近すぎる \"chika-sugiru\" \"too close\", from 近い \"chika-i\" \"close\" – but in the case of a 〜ない \"-na-i\" negative ending (and standalone ない \"nai\"), there is sometimes an intrusive 〜さ \"-sa,\" yielding 〜なさすぎる (standalone なさすぎる \"na-sa-sugiru\") instead of the expected 〜なすぎる \"-na-sugiru.\" Typically this is optional, and generally omitted, as in 忙しな（さ）すぎる \"sewashina(-sa)-sugiru\" \"too restless\", but for single-mora stems it is generally included, as in なさすぎる \"na-sa-sugiru\" \"not too much\", instead of marginal △なすぎる ?\"na-sugiru\". There is considerable variation and uncertainty by native speakers, as these forms are uncommon. Further, this is confusingly similar to the intrusive 〜さ \"-sa\" when an adjective is followed by 〜そうだ \"-sō da\" \"appears, seems\", so 良さそうだ \"yo-sa-sō da\" \"seems good\" and 無さそうだ \"na-sa-sō da\" \"seems not\", but 良すぎる \"yo-sugiru\" \"too good\" and 無さすぎる \"na-sa-sugiru\" \"too not, too absent\".\n\nNote that 静けさ \"shizu-ke-sa\" \"tranquility\" is not an irregular derivation of 静か \"shizu-ka\" \"quiet, still\" – the regular derivation 静かさ \"shizu-ka-sa\" \"quietness, stillness\" exists and is used – but is rather a separate word of distinct etymology – in Old Japanese the root words were 静けし \"shizu-ke-shii\" and 静かなり \"shizu-ka-nari,\" to which the 〜さ \"-sa\" was separately affixed.\n\nSome irregular verbs date at least to Old Japanese, notably する、来る、ある、死ぬ. The other ぬ verb いぬ also dates to Old Japanese, though is now no longer used, and 居る \"iru\" \"be (animate)\" was formerly をる \"woru\" and irregular, though it is now regular.\n\n"}

{"id": "2739246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2739246", "title": "Johannes Messenius", "text": "Johannes Messenius\n\nJohannes Messenius (1579–1636) was a Swedish historian, dramatist and university professor. He was born in the village of Freberga, in Stenby parish in Östergötland, and died in Oulu, in modern-day Finland.\n\nHe was the son of a miller named Jöns Thordsson. At an early age his brilliance caught the attention of a monastery priest named Magnus Andreae, who gave him guidance and taught him. Unbeknownst to the boy's parents, the priest sent him to the Jesuit school in Braunsberg, which was specialized in educating boys for winning Scandinavia back from Protestantism.\n\nAfter seven years in Braunsberg, Johannes travelled across Europe. He visited Denmark in 1602, and in 1603, he was a dinner speaker at Bishop Piotr Tylicki in Kraków. He made a short visit in Rome in 1604, but the climate forced him to return to Germany where he possibly won an M.A. in Ingolstadt, in 1605. He is also said to have received the title \"Poëta cæsarius\" (\"poet of the Emperor\") from emperor Rudolph II.\n\nJohannes moved further north to the Jesuit hostel in Danzig, he taught at a school in Braunsberg, and eventually, he opened a private school in Danzig, where he married Lucia Grothusen, the daughter of Arnold Grothusen, the teacher of king Sigismund.\n\nBy doing a panegyric work, \"Genealogia Sigismundi\", in 1608, he strove for receiving a better position from the king. When the king did not show the expected gratitude, Johannes returned to Sweden, hoping to reclaim his father's farm Långebro, which had been confiscated by the State.\n\nSince Charles IX of Sweden was suspicious towards Catholics and Jesuits, Johannes published a family tree of the kings ancestry, which showed how he was related to the many old dynasties of Europe. Through the intervention of his wife, Johannes received a repatriation permit, and after having given a vow of fealty, he received the position of professor of law and politics at Uppsala University.\n\nJohannes began a productive period in his life, which showed considerable learning. In Danzig, in 1605, his brethren among the Jesuits had informed the Swedish King Charles IX that Johannes had written a mocking poem on him. In order to convince everybody of his contempt for the Jesuits, he published two works. One was shorter and named \"Detecto Fraudis Jesuiticæ\", in 1610, and a longer in Swedish named \"Retorsion och genswars skrifft emoot then lögn och skamlig dicht\", which had already been published in German in 1609.\n\nHe showed his newly acquired fidelity to the House of Vasa by a new genealogic work and by translating into Latin a number of writings against Sigismund of Poland (King Charles' brother). With fervour, he started to do research and to write on Swedish history, and his source criticism was a forerunner of modern history writing.\n\nIn a rapid succession, he published the following works:\n\nBeside this work, he also published older sources for historical studies. He published Ragnvald Ingemundsson's Latin translation of the law of Magnus Eriksson, in 1614, Ericus Olai's Swedish chronicle (1615), the \"Old Prose Chronicle\" and the \"Small Rhyme Chronicle\", Adam of Bremen's description of Scandinavia and the beginning of the \"Large Rhyme Chronicle\". It is evident that this large amount of work did not guarantee an even and high quality, but the many editions of his works that were printed testify to their popularity.\n\nAs a professor and teacher at the university, he became very popular by his concerns for his students, and by teaching them according to the recent \"Braunberg methods\". He also made plays in the Swedish language a popular activity for young people and he also made dramas himself.\n\nHowever, his hubris, boasting and waywardness caused difficulties with his colleagues at the university, especially since Johannes Rudbeck became his main enemy. The students were finally divided into two factions, one for him, and the other one against him. The Consistory at Uppsala became the battle ground for open fights and antics (partly with Messentius' support) that became so serious that the chancellor Axel Oxenstierna had to intervene.\n\nThe two enemies were called to interrogation in Stockholm, in front of the Church council in July 1613. After an investigation, there was a settlement, but both professors were moved from Uppsala. Messenius was entrusted the keeping of the kingdom's old archives, and he was promoted to assessor of the Swedish court of appeal (\"Svea hovrätt\"), in 1614.\n\nThis was the time, when he began to write his plays, which were to influence Swedish drama during the following century. He almost completely rejected the so-called \"school drama\", to which almost all previous Swedish plays had belonged. Instead, he rather followed the movement of the German Jakob Ayrer.\n\nHowever, his most successful decision was to write plays on Swedish history, as it was perceived in his time, i.e. including the Fornaldarsagas. His most influential works were:\nEncouraged by the success of his first two plays, he declared in the introduction of his third play that he intended to cover all of Sweden's history in 50 comedies and tragedies and make them public. Technically, his works were undeveloped and were a combination of ridiculous scenes with serious ones, and he had a certain feel for the presentation of dramatic effects. According to German tradition, he used people from the lower classes for comedy, but the scenes are usually disconnected from the rest of the play. The main play is organized as a series of dialogues that are loosely joined, and motivation and character depiction are considered to be very primitive. He paid close attention to the rendering of historic clothes, although the limited knowledge of his time showed its limitations in this respect. Occasionally, there are songs in the play, songs that belong to the best he has written, and they have been reprinted as late as 1879.\n\nThe works he wrote in prison, \"Christmannus\" and \"Gustavus\" are less known, and incorrectly attributed to his son. They consist of summaries in dialogue of the history of the church in Sweden. In the spite of its weaknesses, Messenius' dramas are considered to be the most original and most patriotic in Sweden's older literature, and the only part of Swedish literature from this time to have been generally praised.\n\nIn 1616, he was accused of conspiring with king Sigismund and the Jesuits. He was found guilty as charged, when he could not find twelve men who swore that he was innocent. He was sentenced to death in July 1616, but the king changed the sentence to prison, probably for life.\n\nIn October 1616, he was transported to the desolate fortress Kajaani Castle at Finland near the Russian border, where he was harshly treated by its commander Erik Hara. He occupied himself with writing historical works and by doing research in Swedish source documents. Every once in a while, he sent pleas to king Gustav II Adolph and later to Christina's regency. In these pleas, he swore on his innocence, or referred to his works as reason for pardon. In 1635, he was moved to Oulu, and had his pension doubled. At this time, the government sent him the translator Erik Schroderus, to appraise himself of Messenius' monumental work \"Scondia illustrata\", which treated Sweden's history from the deluge to Messenius' own time. When Messenius suspected that the government wanted to publish the work in its own name, he demanded freedom for his son, who was also imprisoned, and free passage for himself to wherever he wished. These demands offended the regency who threatened to send him back to Kajaneborg.\n\nShortly, after this, Messenius died, and the government offered his widow 500 dollars for \"Scondia illustrata\". However, she left the kingdom with the manuscripts, and it was her son who later returned the text to Sweden in order to have it published. However, it took a long time to publish the work, and it was only thanks to Johan Peringskiöld that it was published in folio 1700–1705.\n\nConsidering the scholarly traditions of its time, and the conditions in which it was written, this monumental work can only be described as prominent. More than anyone else of his time, he mastered both Swedish and foreign historical literature. The seventh tome of \"Scondia\", which describes the religious conflicts of John III of Sweden is a model for history writing.\n\nFrom his time in prison, there are also several other works, which are mostly still extant.\n\n"}

In 1984, he shifted to Guwahati and joined as an Editor in a new Magazine named \"Sangket\". Additionally, he started a new Children based magazine at his own effort named \"Kon Kon\", but unfortunately they did not run for a long time. After more than a decade, he again worked as an Editor in few famous Assamese Magazines like \"Hiya\", \"Taal\" and \"Kareng\".\n\nIn 1984, he shifted to Guwahati and got married to Pranita Hazarika.

Hazarika can be recognized as one of pioneer writers in the horror genre in the Assamese literature. His expertise in narrating the G etc. are popular among the readers. He has written many novels and books into Gothic fiction, Terror, Paranormal Fear, Children's Literature, Astrology, Comedy, Science Fiction, Adventure etc. He has written over 200 books as children's literature.\n\nHazarika has written over 110 books, that came in a series, popularly known as the Series of Books. Till now, he has written all those books into 11 group of series popularly known as Jason Series (24 books), Pawan Series (18 books), Nandan Series (7 books), Rohan Series (10 books), Jintan Series (7 books), Gun Fighter Series (3 books), Jitu Series (13 books), Ranjan Series (7 books), Valkan Series (14 books), Keron Series (3 books) and Trinayan Series (7 books). Few of characters from the series like \"Jason, Pawan, Nandan, Rohan, Jintan, Jitu, Ranjan, Valkan, Keron, Trinayan\" were very popular among the readers.\n\nHazarika wrote his Autobiography in two parts. The first part was \"Jibanar Phool Aru Kaint\" (Flowers and Thrones of Life) and the second part was \"Jibanar Saat Rang\" (Seven Colors of Life).\n\nAs mentioned in his Autobiographies, Hazarika claims to have experienced many paranormal activities in his real life. They inspired him to write his first horror story named \"Rahashyamayee Haat\" (Mysterious Hand), published in Bismoi and other horror stories, and finally wrote his first horror novel named \"Sesh Rajanigandham\" (Last Morning), published in 1983.\n\nJust before writing every novel, Hazarika prefers to make a detailed research about the location and all. Once, few mountaineers followed one of his novel named \"Mrityur Xital Porox\" (Cold Touch of Death), where Hazarika explained a detailed scenario about the Great Himalayas and the people who actually visited the Himalayas, confirmed that it was exactly the same that Hazarika mentioned in that novel. Ranju Hazarika never visited any foreign locations, but the way he explains about the scenes in his novels are all seems to be real.\n\nRanju Hazarika induced few of fictional characters in many of his novels and those popular characters are \"Detective Debajit Phukan, Pabitra Lahkar, Scientist Amal Krishna Hazarika, Agent Ranjit, Agent Arindom\" etc.\n\n\nSo far, 11 of Hazarika's novels were performed as plays by mobile theater groups like Theater Bhagyadevi, Bordoisila Theatre, Pragjyotish Theartre, Hengul Theatre etc. .\n\nRanju Hazarika's novel \"Zulu\" was published as 3D animated feature film in 2012. \"Aasene Kunuba Hiyat\" (2000) and \"Maya\" (2003) were two movies in Assamese language, based on his novels \"Uttar Phalguni\" and \"Narakar Phool\" respectively.

He is sometimes called Varro Reatinus to distinguish him from his younger contemporary Varro Atacinus.\n\nVarro was born in or near Reate (now Rieti) to a family thought to be of equestrian rank, and always remained close to his roots in the area, owning a large farm in the Reatine plain, reported as near Lago di Ripa Sottile, until his old age. He supported Pompey, reaching the office of praetor, after having been tribune of the people, \"quaestor\" and \"curule aedile\". He was one of the commission of twenty that carried out the great agrarian scheme of Caesar for the resettlement of Capua and Campania (59 BC).\n\nDuring the civil war he commanded one of Pompey's armies in the Ilerda campaign. He escaped the penalties of being on the losing side in the civil war through two pardons granted by Julius Caesar, before and after the Battle of Pharsalus. Caesar later appointed him to oversee the public library of Rome in 47 BC, but following Caesar's death Mark Antony proscribed him, resulting in the loss of much of his property, including his library. As the Republic gave way to Empire, Varro gained the favour of Augustus, under whose protection he found the security and quiet to devote himself to study and writing.\n\nVarro studied under the Roman philologist Lucius Aelius Stilo, and later at Athens under the Academic philosopher Antiochus of Ascalon. Varro proved to be a highly productive writer and turned out more than 74 Latin works on a variety of topics. Among his many works, two stand out for historians; \"Nine Books of Disciplines\" and his compilation of the \"Varronian chronology\". His \"Nine Books of Disciplines\" became a model for later encyclopedists, especially Pliny the Elder. The most noteworthy portion of the \"Nine Books of Disciplines\" is its use of the liberal arts as organizing principles. Varro decided to focus on identifying nine of these arts: grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, musical theory, medicine, and architecture. Using Varro's list, subsequent writers defined the seven classical \"liberal arts of the medieval schools\".\n\nThe compilation of the \"Varronian chronology\" was an attempt to determine an exact year-by-year timeline of Roman history up to his time. It is based on the traditional sequence of the consuls of the Roman Republic — supplemented, where necessary, by inserting \"dictatorial\" and \"anarchic\" years. It has been demonstrated to be somewhat erroneous but has become the widely accepted standard chronology, in large part because it was inscribed on the arch of Augustus in Rome; though that arch no longer stands, a large portion of the chronology has survived under the name of \"Fasti Capitolini.\"\n\nVarro's literary output was prolific; Ritschl estimated it at 74 works in some 620 books, of which only one work survives complete, although we possess many fragments of the others, mostly in Gellius' \"Attic Nights\". Called \"the most learned of the Romans\" by Quintilian, Varro was recognized as an important source by many other ancient authors, among them Cicero, Pliny the Elder, Virgil in the \"Georgics\", Columella, Aulus Gellius, Macrobius, Augustine, and Vitruvius, who credits him (VII.Intr.14) with a book on architecture.\n\nHis only complete work extant, \"Rerum rusticarum libri tres\" (\"Three Books on Agriculture\"), has been described as \"the well digested system of an experienced and successful farmer who has seen and practised all that he records.\"\n\nOne noteworthy aspect of the work is his anticipation of microbiology and epidemiology. Varro warned his contemporaries to avoid swamps and marshland, since in such areas\n\nthere are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, but which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and cause serious diseases.\n\n\n\nMost of the extant fragments of these works (mostly the grammatical works) can be found in the Goetz–Schoell edition of \"De Lingua Latina\", pp. 199–242; in the collection of Wilmanns, pp. 170–223; and in that of Funaioli, pp. 179–371.\n\n\n"}

He made his publishing debut in Yiddish in 1916, with the poem \"Shterndl\" (Little star). In 1918 he moved to the city of Minsk; in 1919, after the Soviet Revolution, to Vilna (today Vilnius, Lithuania); and in 1920 to Berlin.\n\nIn 1923 he came back to Vilna, which after the war had become part of newly independent Poland, and was a center of Yiddish literary culture. In Vilna he taught modern Yiddish literature at the Real-Gymnasium (a Yiddish-speaking high school), as well as at the Yiddish teachers' seminary. By 1928 he became disappointed with the literary atmosphere in Poland, and decided to return to Minsk (capital of the Soviet Belarus), where much of his family lived, and where there was a lively Yiddish literary scene.\n\nIn Minsk, Kulbak worked for several media organizations and for the Jewish section of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus.\n\nKulbak wrote poems, fantastical or \"mystical\" novels, and, after moving to the Soviet Union, what are described by one source as \"Soviet\" satires. His novel \"The Zelmenyaners\" depicted with some realism the absurdities of Soviet life.\n\nHis mystical novella \"The Messiah of the House of Ephraim\" (1924) draws together many strands of Jewish folklore and apocalyptic belief, presenting them from a perspective that owes much to German expressionist cinema. It principally concerns the poor man Benye, who may or may not be a Messiah, and whose destiny is intertwined with the Lamed-Vavniks. (In Jewish mysticism, the Lamed-Vavniks are a group of 36 holy Jews on whose goodness the whole of humanity depends.) Benye, and the many other characters, undergo experiences the strangeness of which approaches incomprehensibility, to themselves as well as the reader. Legendary figures such as Lilith and Simkhe Plakhte are characters in the novel.\n\nIn September 1937, Moyshe Kulbak was arrested during a wave of Stalinist purges. He was accused of espionage and executed a month later together with several dozens of other Belarusian writers, intellectuals and administrators. In 1956, after the death of Joseph Stalin, he was officially rehabilitated by the Soviet authorities\n\n\n\n"}

The transcript was brought out originally in 1972 in \"Semantics of Natural Language\", edited by Donald Davidson and Gilbert Harman. Among analytic philosophers, \"Naming and Necessity\" is widely considered one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century.\n\nLanguage is a primary concern of analytic philosophers, particularly the use of language to express concepts and to refer to individuals.\nIn \"Naming and Necessity\", Kripke considers several questions that are important within analytic philosophy:\n\nKripke's three lectures constitute an attack on descriptivist theories of proper names. Kripke attributes variants of descriptivist theories to Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein and John Searle, among others. According to descriptivist theories, proper names either are synonymous with descriptions, or have their reference determined by virtue of the name's being associated with a description or cluster of descriptions that an object uniquely satisfies. Kripke rejects both these kinds of descriptivism. He gives several examples purporting to render descriptivism implausible as a theory of how names get their reference determined (e.g., surely Aristotle could have died at age two and so not satisfied any of the descriptions we associate with his name, and yet it would seem wrong to deny that he was Aristotle). As an alternative, Kripke adumbrated a causal theory of reference, according to which a name refers to an object by virtue of a causal connection with the object as mediated through communities of speakers. He points out that proper names, in contrast to most descriptions, are rigid designators: A proper name refers to the named object in every possible world in which the object exists, while most descriptions designate different objects in different possible worlds. For example, 'Nixon' refers to the same person in every possible world in which Nixon exists, while 'the person who won the United States presidential election of 1968' could refer to Nixon, Humphrey, or others in different possible worlds.\n\nKripke also raised the prospect of \"a posteriori\" necessities — facts that are necessarily true, though they can be known only through empirical investigation. Examples include \"Hesperus is Phosphorus\", \"Cicero is Tully\", \"Water is H2O\" and other identity claims where two names refer to the same object.\n\nFinally, Kripke gave an argument against identity materialism in the philosophy of mind, the view that every mental fact is identical with some physical fact (See talk). Kripke argued that the only way to defend this identity is as an \"a posteriori\" necessary identity, but that such an identity — e.g., pain is C-fibers firing — could not be necessary, given the possibility of pain that has nothing to do with C-fibers firing. Similar arguments have been proposed by David Chalmers.\n\nKripke delivered the John Locke lectures in philosophy at Oxford in 1973. Titled \"Reference and Existence\", they are in many respects a continuation of \"Naming and Necessity\", and deal with the subjects of fictional names and perceptual error. They have recently been published by Oxford University Press. Quentin Smith has claimed that some of the ideas in \"Naming & Necessity\" were first presented (at least in part) by Ruth Barcan Marcus. Kripke is alleged to have misunderstood Marcus' ideas during a 1969 lecture which he attended (based on the questions he asked), and later arrived at similar conclusions. Marcus, however, has refused to publish the verbatim transcript of the lecture. Smith's view is controversial, and several well-known scholars (for example, Stephen Neale and Scott Soames) have subsequently offered detailed responses arguing that his account is mistaken.\n\nIn the first lecture, Kripke introduced a schematic semi-formal version of the kind of \"theory of naming\" he was \"criticising\" (1980:64–65). He began the second lecture by recapitulating the \"theses\" of this theory, together with the \"noncircularity condition\" he had discussed in closing the first lecture. Apparently, the theses and condition had been written up on a board for all to see. This text was reproduced, as quoted below, in the \"lightly edited\" transcript of 1980 (p. 71).\n\n\nKripke's main goals in this first lecture are to explain and critique the existing philosophical opinions on the way that names work.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the most significant philosophical theory about the nature of names and naming was a theory of Gottlob Frege's that had been developed by Bertrand Russell, the descriptivist theory of names, which was sometimes known as the 'Frege-Russell description theory'. Before Kripke gave his 'Naming and Necessity' lectures, a number of criticisms of this descriptivist theory had been published by leading philosophers, including Ludwig Wittgenstein, John Searle and Peter Strawson. However, Kripke believed that the existing arguments against the Frege-Russell descriptive theory of names failed to identify the real problems with the theory.\n\nIn 'Lecture II', Kripke reconsiders the cluster theory of names and argues for his own position on the nature of reference, a position that contributed to the development of the causal theory of reference.\n\nIn 'Lecture III', Kripke discusses natural kinds, develops the distinction between epistemic and metaphysical necessity, and discusses the mind–body problem in philosophy of mind.\n\nKripke begins by summarising the conclusions drawn in the first two lectures. First, the referent of names is not usually fixed by some property or set of properties that the speaker believes are possessed by the thing or person named. Instead, the referent of names is usually determined by a series of causal links between people who have used the name. Second, when the referent of a name \"is\" determined by a property attributed to the thing named, the link is contingent, rather than necessary or essential. People begin using the name 'Jack the Ripper' to refer to the person responsible for the murder of five women in London. So, the name was fixed to its referent by a description. However, the person who carried out the murders might have been jailed for another crime and, thus, might never have had the property of murdering those women. So, the link between the property of being a murderer and the person referred to is contingent. Third, identity is not a relation that holds between names. It is a relation that holds between an object and itself. When someone accurately claims that two names refer to the same object, the claim is necessarily true, even though it may be known \"a posteriori\". Thus, Kripke claims to have successfully refuted the assumption made by everyone before him that anything that is necessarily true will be known \"a priori\" (i.e. Immanuel Kant 1781/1787).\n\nIn \"Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century: Volume 2: The Age of Meaning\", Scott Soames wrote:\nIn the philosophy of language, \"Naming and Necessity\" is among the most important works ever, ranking with the classical work of Frege in the late nineteenth century, and of Russell, Tarski and Wittgenstein in the first half of the twentieth century . . . \"Naming and Necessity\" played a large role in the implicit, but widespread, rejection of the view—so popular among ordinary language philosophers—that philosophy is nothing more than the analysis of language.\n\n"}

The letter \"Q\" in the word stands for \"Querwandbau\" (cross wall construction).\n\nIn a Q3A panel house, the walls are constructed entirely from concrete blocks, while the ceiling consists of multiple concrete plates that were placed perpendicular to, and on top of the wall elements. This explains the source of the \"cross wall construction\" name. The flat roof construction is the most visible difference between the Q3A series and other East Germany buildings of its time. Q3A homes are equipped with a furnace for heating, and a balcony for use by tenants was also provided in approximately half the cases. In later years (after the fall of the Berlin Wall and German Reunification), most houses were retrofitted with additional balconies.\n\nThe concrete blocks and ceiling elements of the first houses were manufactured at an industrial plant in the Ostseestrasse in Berlin. Other types of panel construction used for Q3A houses were the IW57- and IW58-types. These were produced in much smaller numbers, with some even lacking the signature flat roof, being built with a more classic Hip Roof.\n\nShortly after the first houses were erected in 1957 in the eight quarters of East Berlin, further series utilizing cross wall construction were developed. The QX-series, which were mostly 4-storey buildings, were not constructed from blocks, but from cheaper concrete strips. Most buildings of this series can be found in the \"Hans-Loch\" quarter, which was the first, newly constructed, large-scale settlement in East Berlin after the end of the Second World War. It is worth noting, that while Q3A block buildings were used in most areas of the GDR, the QX-series was constructed on a relatively limited basis. It is therefore regarded as an experimental series.\n\nFurther developments of cross-wall panel buildings happened from 1959 to 1983. These, even more frequently built homes, had the building type designation QP or QP64, for those mainly built in 1964. They were built with five, eight or ten storeys and in contrast to the two previous Q-series buildings, fulfilled the existing building codes by being furnished with a lift. The QP-series was the first type of house utilizing larger, industrial-sized panels. Each individual plate forms a complete wall of a room. The most striking and visible feature of many houses in the QP series is the colouring of the exterior walls, usually consisting of white or yellow tiles. The first buildings of this series originated in Berlin, between Strausberg and the Alexanderplatz, in the western half of the former Stalin Avenue as well as the Hans-Loch Quarter.\n\nThe early 1970s were marked by the arrival of by far the most common series -- the WBS70 (Wohnungsbauserie 70). Approximately 900,000 apartment units of this type were constructed -- consisting of five-, six- and eleven-storey buildings. Other large-panel series were the P2 and WHH GT 18 series. These were constructed as part of the \"Sonderbauprogramm Berlin\" (special construction program Berlin), which allocated special funds to improving the housing of what was then, the capital of the GDR -- East Berlin.\n\nQ3A\n\n\nQX\n\n\nQP\n\n\n"}

The Jerusalem neighborhood Ramat Shlomo is named after Rabbi Auerbach.\n\nShlomo Zalman Auerbach was the first child to be born in the Shaarei Chesed neighborhood of Jerusalem founded by his maternal grandfather, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Porush, after whom he was named. His father, Rabbi Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach, was rosh yeshiva of Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva, and his mother was Rebbetzin Tzivia.\n\nBy the age of eleven he was proficient in the entire talmudic tractate of Kiddushin. As a teenager he attended the Etz Chaim Yeshiva in Jerusalem. He was known for his diligence which is illustrated by an event which occurred while he was in yeshiva. On the day the first automobile rolled into Jerusalem along the Jaffa Road, all the students left their studies to marvel at the horse-less wagon. Only young Shlomo Zalman remained in his chair immersed in his studies. \n\nFollowing his marriage, he studied under Rabbi Zvi Pesach Frank at Kollel Kerem Tzion which focused on the laws of the Land of Israel. He was known as one of the Charedi Ashkenazi supporters for Heter Mechira during the Shmita year.\n\nHis first major published work, \"Meorei Esh\", was the first ever written on the subject of using electricity on Shabbat. The work was endorsed by Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski who read it and declared: \"Or chadash al Tziyon ta'ir\" — \"A new light will shine upon Zion\" — a quote from the daily morning prayers.\n\nHe had a close association with Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, as well as the Chazon Ish and Rabbi Elazar Menachem Shach, the two iconic and preeminent leaders of Lithuanian Haredi Judaism of the first and middle segments of the 20th century. He became the pre-eminent halachic decisor of his time in Israel, respected by all streams of Orthodox Judaism. He was unique in his approach to halacha through thought experiments.\n\nHe was the brother-in-law of Rabbi Sholom Schwadron, who married his sister Leah. The two shared a long and close relationship as learning partners and personal friends.\n\nRenowned for his lucid classes as Rosh Yeshiva, his thousands of students continue to influence the Torah world today. \n\nAn estimated 300,000 - 500,000 people attended his funeral in 1995. He was interred on Har HaMenuchot.\n\nRabbi Auerbach had seven sons and three daughters. His sons are:\n\nRabbi Auerbach's daughters:\n\n\nSefarim authored by Rabbi Auerbach include:\n\nHe also authored a commentary on \"Shev Shema'tata\", which itself is a work of novellae on the Talmud by Rabbi Aryeh Leib HaCohen Heller.\n\nMost of Rabbi Auerbach's halachic rulings were delivered orally and not published formally. However, his rulings on medical halacha were summarized and publicized by Rabbi Yehoshua Neuwirth in his book \"Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah\", Rabbi Dr. Abraham S. Abraham in his \"Nishmat Avraham\", and Rabbi Dr. Avraham Steinberg in his \"Encyclopedia Hilchatit Refuit\". Rabbi Neuwirth also made many of Rabbi Auerbach's rulings on Hilkhot Shabbat (Shabbat laws) widely known in his bestselling book, which was first published in Hebrew in 1965 and subsequently rendered into English.\n\n"}
{"id": "2423284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2423284", "title": "Siouan languages", "text": "Siouan languages\n\nSiouan or Siouan–Catawban is a language family of North America that is located primarily in the Great Plains, Ohio and Mississippi valleys and southeastern North America with a few other languages in the east.\n\nAuthors who call the entire family \"Siouan\" distinguish the two branches as \"Western Siouan\" and \"Eastern Siouan\" or as \"Siouan-proper\" and \"Catawban\". Others restrict the name \"Siouan\" to the western branch and use the name \"Siouan–Catawban\" for the entire family. Generally, however, the name \"Siouan\" is used without distinction.\n\nSiouan languages can be grouped into the Western Siouan languages and Catawban languages. The Western Siouan languages can be divided into Missouri River languages (such as Crow and Hidatsa), Mandan, Mississippi River languages (such as Dakotan, Chiwere-Winnebago, and Dhegihan languages), and Ohio Valley Siouan branches. The Catawban languages consist only of Catawban and Woccon.\n\nThere is a certain amount of comparative work in Siouan–Catawban languages. Wolff (1950–51) is among the first and more complete works on the subject. Wolff reconstructed the system of proto-Siouan, and this was modified by Matthews (1958). The latter's system is shown below:\n\nWith respect to vowels, five oral vowels are being reconstructed and three nasal vowels . Wolff also reconstructed some consonantal clusters .\n\nCollaborative work involving a number of Siouanists started at the 1984 Comparative Siouan Workshop at the University of Colorado with the goal of creating a comparative Siouan dictionary that would include Proto-Siouan reconstructions. This work yielded a different analysis of the phonemic system of Proto-Siouan, which appears below:\n\nIn Siouanist literature (e.g., Rankin et al. 2015), Americanist phonetic transcriptions are the norm, so IPA * is Americanist *š, IPA *j is Americanist *y, and so on.\n\nThe major change to the previously-proposed system by systematically accounting for the distribution of multiple stop series in modern Siouan languages by tracing them back to multiple stop series in the proto-language. Previous analysis posited only a single stop series.\n\nMany of the consonant clusters proposed by Wolf (19501951) can be accounted for due to syncopation of short vowels before stressed syllables. For example, Matthews (1958: 129) gives *wróke as the proto-form for 'male.' With added data from a larger set of Siouan languages since the middle of the twentieth century, Rankin et al. (2015) give *waroː(-ka) as the reconstructed form for 'male.'\n\nUnlike Wolff and Matthew's proposals, there are no posited nasal consonants in Proto-Siouan. Nasal consonants only arise in daughter languages when followed by a nasal vowel. \nIn addition, there is a set of sounds that represent obstruentized versions of their corresponding sonorants. These sounds have different reflexes in daughter languages, with *w appearing as [w] or [m] in most daughter languages, while *W has a reflex of [w], [b], [mb], or [p]. The actual phonetic value of these obstruents is an issue of some debate, with some arguing that they arise through geminated *w+*w or *r+*r sequences or a laryngeal plus *w or *r.\n\nPrevious work on Proto-Siouan only posited single vowel length. However, phonemic vowel length exists in several Siouan languages such as Hidatsa, Ho-Chunk, and Tutelo. Rankin et al. (2015) analyze numerous instances of long vowels as present due to common inheritance rather than common innovation. The five oral vowels and three nasal vowels posited by earlier scholars is expanded to include a distinction between short and long vowels. The proposed Proto-Siouan vowel system appears below:\n\nThe Yuchi isolate may be the closest relative of Sioux–Catawban, based on both sound changes and morphological comparison.\n\nIn the 19th century, Robert Latham suggested that the Siouan languages are related to the Caddoan and Iroquoian languages. In 1931, Louis Allen presented the first list of systematic correspondences between a set of 25 lexical items in Siouan and Iroquoian. In the 1960s and 1970s, Wallace Chafe further explored the link between Siouan and Caddoan languages. In the 1990s, Marianne Mithun compared the morphology and syntax of all the three families. At present, this Macro-Siouan hypothesis is not considered proved, and the similarities between the three families may instead be due to their protolanguages having been part of a sprachbund.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17721443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17721443", "title": "Winemaking cooperative", "text": "Winemaking cooperative\n\nA winemaking cooperative is an agricultural cooperative which is involved in winemaking, and which in similarity to other cooperatives is owned by its members. The members in a winemaking cooperative are usually vineyard owners, who deliver grapes to the cooperative, which is involved in production of wine from the grapes and the subsequent marketing activities.\n\nWinemaking cooperatives are responsible for a significant proportion of the total wine production in many major wine-producing countries, including most of the classical European wine countries, but their importance varies much between different wine regions within these countries. Cooperatives tend to be more important in regions where the wine’s selling price is relatively low and average size of vineyard holdings is small.\n\nWhile some winemaking cooperatives were established in the 19th century, the majority were established in the early 1930s following the Great Depression.\n\nThe advantage to members of a cooperative, in comparison to pursuing winemaking and marketing on their own, consists in pooling resources and sharing costs for winemaking and marketing, which call for costly equipment and technical expertise. There are also other financial advantages, including certain European Union subsidies for cooperatives located in EU countries.\n\nWines from cooperatives are often allowed to be described as producer-bottled according to the wine laws of the country in question, which is sometimes an advantage in marketing. The French term corresponding to this is \"mis(e) en bouteille à la propriété\", while the German is \"Erzeugerabfüllung\".\n\nProducing and marketing the wine on his or her own is usually not a realistic possibility for many vineyard owners with small holdings. However, being a member of a winemaking cooperative is not the only option available. Selling grapes on the open market, entering into long-term contracts with negociants or other winemaking companies and leasing out the vineyard to certain negociants are other options. The relative attractiveness of these options varies greatly between regions. As an example, in regions characterised by constant overproduction of wine, the market price of grapes is often depressed to a very low level, while grapes in Champagne command much higher prices as long as they fulfill some basic criteria.\n\nIn France, winemaking cooperatives are typically called \"caves coopératives\", and produce more than half the total amount of French wine. The first winemaking cooperative was established in Alsace in 1895, although at this time Alsace was part of the German Empire rather than France. Members of French winemaking cooperatives own more than half the total French vineyard surface. The \"caves\" have their greatest strength on the Vin de pays level, where they are responsible for about three-quarter of the production. They have been involved in the large-scale switch over of the French wine production from the lower Vin de table category to Vin de pays. Many cooperatives also produce an impressive range of Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) wine.\n\nThe total number of French winemaking cooperatives was over 850 in the early 2000s, with an average membership of 160 per cooperative in the 1990s. Cooperatives are particularly strong in Languedoc, Roussillon, Rhône, Provence and Corsica. Some of the more notable cooperatives are also found in Alsace and Chablis.\n\nIn Germany, a winemaking cooperative is often called \"Winzergenossenschaft\", but can also be called \"Winzerverein\", \"Winzervereinigung\", \"Weingärtnergenossenschaft\" or \"Weinbauerverband\". The earliest German winemaking cooperatives date back to the time before the later association laws were established. A union of winemakers in Neckarsulm in Württemberg pressed grapes and sold the resulting must, and to some extent also wine, cooperatively as early as 1834. Prussia passed an association law (\"Genossenschaftsgesetz\") in 1867, which became law in the entire North German Confederation in 1868. One of the first winemaking cooperatives founded on the basis of this legislation, \"Winzerverein Mayschoß\", was established in 1868 in the Ahr region and is the oldest German winemaking cooperative still in existence. Two thirds of all German vine-growers belong to a cooperative, but because of a dominance of small vineyard holdings and part-time vine growing among these members, their production is slightly less than one-third of the German total. In 2008/2009, there were 209 cooperatives in Germany with a total of 51 000 members and vineyard surface. There has been a trend to fewer cooperatives (275 existed in 1998/1999) due to fusions.\n\nA special form of winemaking cooperative is the \"Zentralkellereien\", a centralized cooperative found in many German wine regions, where local cooperatives rather than individual growers deliver grapes, grape must or wine. Therefore, of the 209 cooperatives existing in Germany in 2008/2009, only 120 actually produced wine on their own premises.\n\nCooperatives are particularly important in Württemberg, where they account for 80% of the production (2008), Baden, where they account for 76%, and the smallest German wine regions Ahr, Hessische Bergstrasse, Saale-Unstrut and Saxony.\n\nIn southern Europe, cooperatives are responsible for a large part of the wine production. Figures of around 60 percent have been quoted for Italy’s \"cantina sociale\" and cooperatives in Spain and Portugal. However, in contrast to the situation in France and Germany, a large proportion of the cooperatives’ wine is not bottled by the cooperative, but instead is sold in bulk for bottling by commercial operators or, especially in the case of Spain, for distillation.\n\nIn South Africa, KWV (\"Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika\") was originally formed as a winemaking cooperative which also had certain regulatory privileges akin to those of a government agency. However, in 2002, KWV was transformed into a regular commercial company.\n"}
