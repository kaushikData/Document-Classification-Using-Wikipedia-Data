Most commonly, it refers to medication or drug compliance, but it can also apply to other situations such as medical device use, self care, self-directed exercises, or therapy sessions. Both patient and health-care provider affect compliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is the most important factor in improving compliance, The cost of prescription medication also plays a major role.\n\nCompliance can be confused with concordance, which is the process by which a patient and clinician make decisions together about treatment.\n\nWorldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care. 2003 estimates from the World Health Organization indicated that only about 50% of patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations with particularly low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma, diabetes, and hypertension. Major barriers to compliance are thought to include the complexity of modern medication regimens, poor \"health literacy\" and not understanding treatment benefits, occurrence of undiscussed side effects, poor treatment satisfaction, cost of prescription medicine, and poor communication or lack of trust between a patient and his or her health-care provider. Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying medication packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed simultaneously. Studies show a great variation in terms of characteristics and effects of interventions to improve medicine adherence. It is still unclear how adherence can consistently be improved in order to promote clinically important effects.\n\nIn medicine, compliance (synonymous with adherence, capacitance) describes the degree to which a patient correctly follows medical advice. Most commonly, it refers to medication or drug compliance, but it can also apply to medical device use, self care, self-directed exercises, or therapy sessions. Both patient and health-care provider affect compliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is the most important factor in improving compliance,\n\nAs of 2003, US health care professionals more commonly used the term \"adherence\" to a regimen rather than \"compliance\", because it has been thought to reflect better the diverse reasons for patients not following treatment directions in part or in full. Additionally, the term adherence includes the ability of the patient to take medications as prescribed by their physician with regards to the correct drug, dose, route, timing, and frequency. It has been noted that compliance may only refer to passively following orders.\n\nThe term concordance has been used in the United Kingdom to involve a patient in the treatment process to improve compliance, and refers to a 2003 NHS initiative. In this context, the patient is informed about their condition and treatment options,involved in the decision as to which course of action to take, and partially responsible for monitoring and reporting back to the team.\n\nAs of 2005, the preferred terminology remained a matter of debate. As of 2007, concordance has been used to refer specifically to patient adherence to a treatment regimen which the physician sets up collaboratively with the patient, to differentiate it from adherence to a physician-only prescribed treatment regimen. Despite the ongoing debate, adherence has been the preferred term for the World Health Organization, The American Pharmacists Association, and the U.S. National Institutes of Health Adherence Research Network.\n\nAn estimated half of those for whom treatment regimens are prescribed do not follow them as directed.\nUntil recently, this was termed \"non-compliance\", which some regarded as meaning that someone did not follow the treatment directions due to irrational behavior or willful ignoring of instructions.\n\nCost and poor understanding of the directions for the treatment, referred to as 'health literacy' have been known to be major barriers to treatment adherence.\nThere is robust evidence that education and physical health are correlated. Poor educational attainment is a key factor in the cycle of health inequalities.\n\nEducational qualifications help to determine an individual's position in the labour market, their level of income and therefore their access to resources.\n\nIn 1999 one fifth of UK adults, nearly seven million people, had problems with basic skills, especially functional literacy and functional numeracy, described as: \"The ability to read, write and speak in English, and to use mathematics at a level necessary to function at work and in society in general.\" This made it impossible for them to effectively take medication, read labels, follow drug regimes, and find out more. This was\n\nIn 2003, 20% of adults in the UK had a long-standing illness or disability and a national study for the UK Department of Health, found more than one-third of people with poor or very poor health had literary skills of Entry Level 3 or below.\n\nLow levels of literacy and numeracy were found to be associated with socio-economic deprivation. Adults in more deprived areas, such as the North East of England, performed at a lower level than those in less deprived areas such as the South East. Local authority tenants and those in poor health were particularly likely to lack basic skills.\n\nA 2000 analysis of over 100 UK local education authority areas found educational attainment at 15–16 years of age to be strongly associated with coronary heart disease and subsequent infant mortality.\n\nA study of the relationship of literacy to asthma knowledge revealed that 31% of asthma patients with a reading level of a ten-year-old knew they needed to see the doctors, even when they were not having an asthma attack, compared to 90% with a high school graduate reading level.\n\nIn 2013 the US National Community Pharmacists Association sampled for one month 1,020 Americans above age 40 for with an ongoing prescription to take medication for a chronic condition and gave a grade C+ on adherence. In 2009, this contributed to an estimated cost of $290 billion annually. In 2012, increase in patient medication cost share was found to be associated with low adherence to medication.\n\nThe United States is among the countries with the highest prices of prescription drugs mainly attributed to the government's lack of negotiating lower prices with monopolies in the pharmaceutical industry especially with brand name drugs. In order to manage medication costs, many US patients on long term therapies fail to fill their prescription, skip or reduce doses. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2015, about three quarters (73%) of the public think drug prices are unreasonable and blame pharmaceutical companies for setting prices so high. In the same report, half of the public reported that they are taking prescription drugs and a \"quarter (25%) of those currently taking prescription medicine report they or a family member have not filled a prescription in the past 12 months due to cost, and 18 percent report cutting pills in half or skipping doses\". In a 2009 comparison to Canada, only 8% of adults reported to have skipped their doses or not filling their prescriptions due to the cost of their prescribed medications.\n\nBoth young and elderly status have been associated with non-adherence.\n\nThe elderly often have multiple health conditions, and around half of all NHS medicines are prescribed for people over retirement age, despite representing only about 20% of the UK population. The recent National Service Framework on the care of older people highlighted the importance of taking and effectively managing medicines in this population. However, elderly individuals may face challenges, including multiple medications with frequent dosing, and potentially decreased dexterity or cognitive functioning. Patient knowledge is a concern that has been observed.\n\nIn 1999 Cline et al. identified several gaps in knowledge about medication in elderly patients discharged from hospital. Despite receiving written and verbal information, 27% of older people discharged after heart failure were classed as non-adherent within 30 days. Half the patients surveyed could not recall the dose of their medication and nearly two-thirds did not know what time of day to take them. A 2001 study by Barat et al. evaluated the medical knowledge and factors of adherence in a population of 75-year-olds living at home. They found that 40% of elderly patients do not know the purpose of their regimen and only 20% knew the consequences of non-adherence. Comprehension, polypharmacy, living arrangement, multiple doctors, and use of compliance aids was correlated with adherence. According to a conservative estimate 10% of all hospital admissions are through patients not managing their medication.\n\nIn children with asthma self-management compliance is critical and co-morbidites have been noted to affect outcomes; in 2013 it has been suggested that electronic monitoring may help adherence.\n\nSocial factors of treatment adherence have been studied in children and adolescent psychiatric disorders:\n\nPeople of different ethnic backgrounds have unique adherence issues through literacy, physiology, culture or poverty. There are few published studies on adherence in medicine taking in ethnic minority communities. Ethnicity and culture influence some health-determining behaviour, such as participation in screening programmes and attendance at follow-up appointments.\n\nPrieto \"et al\" emphasised the influence of ethnic and cultural factors on adherence. They pointed out that groups differ in their attitudes, values and beliefs about health and illness. This view could affect adherence, particularly with preventive treatments and medication for asymptomatic conditions. Additionally, some cultures fatalistically attribute their good or poor health to their god(s), and attach less importance to self-care than others. also\n\nMeasures of adherence may need to be modified for different ethnic or cultural groups. In some cases, it may be advisable to assess patients from a cultural perspective before making decisions about their individual treatment.\n\nNot all patients will fill the prescription at a pharmacy. In a 2010 U.S. study, 20–30% of prescriptions were never filled at the pharmacy. Reasons people do not fill prescriptions include the cost of the medication, A US nationwide survey of 1,010 adults in 2001 found that 22% chose not to fill prescriptions because of the price, which is similar to the 20–30% overall rate of unfilled prescriptions. Other factors are doubting the need for medication, or preference for self-care measures other than medication. Convenience, side effects and lack of demonstrated benefit are also factors.\n\nPrescription medical claims records can be used to estimate medication adherence based on fill rate. Patients can be routinely defined as being 'Adherent Patients' if the amount of medication furnished is at least 80% based on days' supply of medication divided by the number of days patient should be consuming the medication. This percentage is called the medication possession ratio (MPR). 2013 work has suggested that a medication possession ratio of 90% or above may be a better threshold for deeming consumption as 'Adherent'.\n\nTwo forms of MPR can be calculated, fixed and variable. Calculating either is relatively straightforward, for Variable MPR (VMPR) it is calculated as the number of days' supply divided by the number of elapsed days including the last prescription.\n\nformula_1\n\nFor the Fixed MPR (FMPR) the calculation is similar but the denominator is the number of days in a year whilst the numerator is constrained to be the number of days' supply within the year that the patient has been prescribed.\n\nformula_2\n\nFor medication in tablet form it is relatively straightforward to calculate the number of days' supply based on a prescription. Some medications are less straightforward though because a prescription of a given number of doses may have a variable number of days' supply because the number of doses to be taken per day varies, for example with preventative corticosteroid inhalers prescribed for asthma where the number of inhalations to be taken daily may vary between individuals based on the severity of the disease.\n\nOnce started, patients seldom follow treatment regimens as directed, and seldom complete the course of treatment. In respect of hypertension, 50% of patients completely drop out of care within a year of diagnosis. Persistence with first-line single antihypertensive drugs is extremely low during the first year of treatment. As far as lipid-lowering treatment is concerned, only one third of patients are compliant with at least 90% of their treatment. Intensification of patient care interventions (e.g. electronic reminders, pharmacist-led interventions, healthcare professional education of patients) improves patient adherence rates to lipid-lowering medicines, as well as total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in 2003 that only 50% of people complete long-term therapy for chronic illnesses as they were prescribed, which puts patient health at risk. For example, in 2002 statin compliance dropped to between 25–40% after two years of treatment, with patients taking statins for what they perceive to be preventative reasons being unusually poor compliers.\n\nA wide variety of packaging approaches have been proposed to help patients complete prescribed treatments. These approaches include formats that increase the ease of remembering the dosage regimen as well as different labels for increasing patient understanding of directions. For example, medications are sometimes packed with reminder systems for the day and/or time of the week to take the medicine. Some evidence shows that reminder packaging may improve clinical outcomes such as blood pressure.\n\nA not-for-profit organisation called the Healthcare Compliance Packaging Council of Europe] (HCPC-Europe) was set up between the pharmaceutical industry, the packaging industry with representatives of European patients organisations. The mission of HCPC-Europe is to assist and to educate the healthcare sector in the improvement of patient compliance through the use of packaging solutions. A variety of packaging solutions have been developed by this collaboration.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) groups barriers to medication adherence into five categories; health care team and system-related factors, social and economic factors, condition-related factors, therapy-related factors, and patient-related factors. Common barriers include:\n\nHealth care providers play a great role in improving adherence issues. Providers can improve patient interactions through motivational interviewing and active listening. Health care providers should work with patients to devise a plan that is meaningful for the patient's needs. A relationship that offers trust, cooperation, and mutual responsibility can greatly improve the connection between provider and patient for a positive impact.\n\nIn 2012 it was predicted that as telemedicine technology improves, physicians will have better capabilities to remotely monitor patients in real-time and to communicate recommendations and medication adjustments using personal mobile devices, such as smartphones, rather than waiting until the next office visit.\n\nMedication Event Monitoring Systems, as in the form of smart medicine bottle tops, smart pharmacy vials or smart blister packages as used in clinical trials and other applications where exact compliance data are required, work without any patient input, and record the time and date the bottle or vial was accessed, or the medication removed from a blister package. The data can be read via proprietary readers, or NFC enabled devices, such as smartphones or tablets. A 2009 study stated that such devices can help improve adherence.\n\nA WHO study estimates that only 50% of patients suffering from chronic diseases in developed countries follow treatment recommendations. The\n\nAsthma non-compliance (28–70% worldwide) increases the risk of severe asthma attacks requiring preventable ER visits and hospitalisations; compliance issues with asthma can be caused by a variety of reasons including: difficult inhaler use, side effects of medications, and cost of the treatment.\n\n200,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK. One in three adults in the UK will develop cancer that can be life-threatening, and 120,000 people will be killed by their cancer each year. This accounts for 25% of all deaths in the UK. However while 90% of cancer pain can be effectively treated, only 40% of patients adhere to their medicines due to poor understanding.\n\nThe reasons for non-adherence have been given by patients as follows:\n\nPartridge \"et al\" (2002) identified evidence to show that adherence rates in cancer treatment are variable, and sometimes surprisingly poor. The following table is a summary of their findings:\n\n\nIn 1998, trials evaluating Tamoxifen as a preventative agent have shown dropout rates of around one-third:\n\n\nIn March 1999, the \"Adherence in the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study\" evaluating the effect of a daily dose of Tamoxifen for five years in at-risk women aged 35–70 years was \n\nPatients with diabetes are at high risk of developing coronary heart disease and usually have related conditions that make their treatment regimens even more complex, such as hypertension, obesity and depression which are also characterised by poor rates of adherence.\n\nAs a result of poor compliance, 75% of patients with a diagnosis of hypertension do not achieve optimum blood-pressure control.\n\nA 2003 review found that 41–59% of mentally ill patients took their medication infrequently or not at all.\n\nA 2006 review investigated the effects of compliance therapy for schizophrenia: and found no clear evidence to suggest that compliance therapy was beneficial for people with schizophrenia and related syndromes.\n\n\n"}

His father Basti Madhav Shenoy popularly known as Motra Madhav was booking agent of then famous CPC Bus Service of Mangalore. Basti Madhav Shenoy was revered by people of all communities because of his leadership qualities. Vaman Shenoy's Mother was Gowri alias Bhagirathi. He passed out of Tenth Standard (SSLC) in 1952 from the SVS High School in Bantwal. He wanted to pursue higher education and become a teacher but due to his family conditions he had to leave school and join his father to help in his business. For a brief period he also worked in Canara Bank. Vaman Shenoy's father died in 1957 with this the responsibility of whole family fell on the shoulders of Vaman Shenoy. He married Savithri in 1959.\n\nBasti Vaman Shenoy involved in Indian National Congress and its trade union wing INTUC Activities in Bantwal between 1954 and 1962 and during this period he was influenced by T.

In association with Kasturba Medical College he set up an Outreach Specialist Clinic in Vyayama Shala premises in 1988.\n\nT. A. Pai liked the leadership qualities and enthusiasm of young Vaman Shenoy and asked him to join Syndicate Bank in 1962. He joined Panemangalore Branch as Clerk. Within 20 months he was promoted as Officer and won many laurels for his outstanding performance in rural banking and deposit mobilization. In 1968 he became the Manager of newly started Raibhag Branch in Belagaum District. There he won Gold Medal for his exemplary performance in Agricultural Finance. In 1972 he transferred and returned to Panemangalore where he started his Banking Career from, took over as Manager of the Branch.\n\nIn 1974 Villages on the banks of River Netravati in Bantwal Taluk got submerged in the flood. Basti Vaman Shenoy took initiative in setting up several relief camps in the Taluk and supported the industry and trade activities by refinancing the traders through Syndicate Bank. He served Syndicate Bank in various Branches including Shimoga and Moodabidri till his voluntary retirement in 1992.\n\nBasti Vaman Shenoy's membership to the Konkani Bhasha Mandal, Karnataka dates back to 1980 but it was in 1992 after his retirement from his Banking Career he devoted completely to Konkani Activities. Paul Moras, the then President of the Konkani Bhasha Mandal, Karnataka entrusted him the post of Organising Secretary of the Konkani Jatha a movement for organising people to demand establishment of Konkani Academy. He along with others toured extensively to organise 'Jathas' (Rally) in several cities of Karnataka State. Jatha Submitted the Memorandum demanding Konkani Academy for the state with the Karnataka Government in 1992 October.\n\nIn 1993 Basti Vaman Shenoy became the President of Konkani Bhasha Mandal Karnataka. He was instrumental in initiating Teaching of Konkani Language in Canara High School Mangalore. He rigorously lobbied the Karnataka state Government for the establishment of Konkani Academy. Because of his efforts in 1994-95 the then Chief Minister of Karnataka Dr. Veerappa Moily announced the establishment of Konkani Academy in the state. Thus Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Academy came into existence.\nIn 1995 from 16 December to 22, under the auspice of Konkani Bhasha Mandal Karnataka, as Chief Convener, Basti Vaman Shenoy organised First World Konkani Convention in Mangalore. Margaret Alva, the then Central Minister was the Hon. Chairman, and K.K.Pai was the Chairman of the Organising Committee. 5000 Delegates from all over the world attended this Convention. The Convention bought together Konkani Speaking People from all regions, Religion, dialect and sub communities. The then Chief Minister of Karnataka H.D. Deve Gowda inaugurated the Convention. The 7 Days convention consisting of seminars, debates, cultural presentations, exhibition and food festival was a grand success. Delegates honoured Basti Vaman Shenoy with a title of \"Vishwa Konkani Sardar\" (World Leader of Konkani). Basti Vaman Shenoy presented before the gathering of world representatives of Konkani People his dream to establish a permanent entity for the preservation and promotion of Konkani language, art and culture.

It came into being immediately after the World Konkani Convention in 1995. Basti Vaman Shenoy became its President. Eminent Banker, Philanthropist and Social Leader K.K. Pai became Chairman of the KLCF. The Foundation stone marking the beginning of construction work was laid in a ceremony in September 2005 by Eminent Philanthropist Dr. P. Dayanand Pai. The then Union Minister Mr. Oscar Fernandes and Cooperative Minister of Government of Karnataka Shri R.V.Deshpande were present. Basti Vaman Shenoy toured relentlessly to raise funds for this mammoth project all over India and abroad. After the demise of Shri K.K.Pai, the Chairmanship of the KLCF is served by Dr. P. Dayananda Pai, eminent philanthropist.\n\nVishwa Konkani Abhiyan\n\nIn the auspice of KLCF, Basti Vaman Shenoy initiated a movement called Visha Konkani abhiyan aimed at creating opportunity of interaction between Konkani Writers and Scholars with their counterparts in other languages of the country. The Abhiyan was inaugurated at New Delhi on 12 October 2008 by Former Union Minister Margaret Alva. Dr. M. Veerappa Moily released a Book on Rashtrakavi M. Govinda Pai translated to Hindi from Konkani. Eminent Economist and Sanskrit Scholar Dr. V. R. Panchamukhi (former chairman ICSSR) presided over the function. A seminar \"Integration Through Languages\" was held in which scholars from Panjabi, Hindi, Persian, Urdu, Kannada and Konkani Languages participated. Similar programs were held in Baroda, Mumbai and Pune.\n\nKonkani: विश्व कोंकणी केंद्र Kannada:ವಿಶ್ವ ಕೊಂಕಣಿ ಕೇಂದ್ರ\n\nWorld Konkani Centre, built on a 3 Acre plot called Konkani Gaon (Konkani Village) at Shakti Nagar, Mangalore was inaugurated by Shri Digambar Kamat, Hon'ble Chief Minister of Goa on 17 January 2009.

It is preceded by direct examination (in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, South Africa, India and Pakistan known as examination-in-chief) and may be followed by a redirect (re-examination in England, Scotland, Australia, Canada, South Africa, India, Hong Kong, and Pakistan).\n\nIn the United States federal Courts, a cross-examining attorney is typically not permitted to ask questions that do not pertain to the testimony offered during direct examination, but most state courts do permit a lawyer to cross-examine a witness on matters not raised during direct examination. Similarly, courts in England, South Africa, Australia, and Canada allow a cross-examiner to exceed the scope of direct examination.\n\nSince a witness called by the opposing party is presumed to be hostile, cross-examination does permit leading questions. A witness called by the direct examiner, on the other hand, may only be treated as hostile by that examiner after being permitted to do so by the judge, at the request of that examiner and as a result of the witness being openly antagonistic and/or prejudiced against the opposing party.\n\nCross-examination is a key component in a trial and the topic is given substantial attention during courses on Trial Advocacy. The opinions by a jury or judge are often changed during cross examination if doubt is cast on the witness. In other times a credible witness affirms the belief in their original statements or in some cases enhances the judge's or jury's belief. Though the closing argument is often considered the deciding moment of a trial, effective cross-examination wins trials.\n\nAttorneys anticipate hostile witness' responses during pretrial planning, and often attempt to shape the witnesses' perception of the questions to draw out information helpful to the attorney's case. Typically during an attorney's closing argument he will repeat any admissions made by witnesses that favor their case. Indeed, in the United States, cross-examination is seen as a core part of the entire adversarial system of justice, in that it \"is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.\" Another key component affecting a trial outcome is the jury selection, in which attorneys will attempt to include jurors from whom they feel they can get a favorable response or at the least unbiased fair decision. So while there are many factors affecting the outcome of a trial, the cross-examination of a witness will often influence an open-minded unbiased jury searching for the certainty of facts upon which to base their decision.\n\n\n"}

Formally, the reference context-free grammar of the language is ambiguous, meaning there is more than one correct parse tree.\n\nIn many programming languages one may write conditionally executed code in two forms: the if-then form, and the if-then-else form – the else clause is optional:\n\nThis gives rise to an ambiguity in interpretation when there are nested statements, specifically whenever an if-then form appears as codice_1 in an if-then-else form:\n\nIn this example, codice_2 is unambiguously executed when codice_3 is true and codice_4 is true, but one may interpret codice_5 as being executed when codice_3 is false (thus attaching the else to the first if) or when codice_3 is true and codice_4 is false (thus attaching the else to the second if). In other words, one may see the previous statement as either of the following expressions:\n\nThe dangling else problem dates to ALGOL 60, and has been resolved in various ways in subsequent languages. In LR parsers, the dangling else is the archetypal example of a shift-reduce conflict.\n\nThis is a problem that often comes up in compiler construction, especially scannerless parsing. The convention when dealing with the dangling else is to attach the else to the nearby if statement, allowing for unambiguous context-free grammars, in particular. Programming languages like Pascal, C and Java follow this convention, so there is no ambiguity in the semantics of the \"language\", though the use of a parser generator may lead to ambiguous \"grammars\". In these cases alternative grouping is accomplished by explicit blocks, such as codice_9 in Pascal and codice_10 in C.\n\nDepending on the compiler construction approach, one may take different corrective actions to avoid ambiguity:\n\n\nThe problem can also be solved by making explicit the link between an else and its if, within the syntax. This usually helps avoid human errors.\n\nPossible solutions are:\n\nConcrete examples follow.\n\nIn C, the grammar reads, in part:\nThus, without further rules, the statement\n\nif (a) if (b) s; else s2;\n\ncould ambiguously be parsed as if it were either:\n\nif (a)\n\nor:\n\nif (a)\nelse\n\nIn practice in C the first tree is chosen, by associating the codice_13 with the nearest codice_14.\n\nThe above example could be rewritten in the following way to remove the ambiguity:\nAny other statement-related grammar rules may also have to be duplicated in this way if they may directly or indirectly end with a codice_15 or codice_16 non-terminal.\n\nHowever, we give grammar that includes both of if and while statements.\n\nFinally, we give the grammar that forbids ambiguous IF statements.\n\n"}

They are securities printed by the finance ministry of the relevant country.\n\nExcise stamps are often as detailed in their design as banknotes - usually made from the same type of paper and containing holograms and other anti-counterfeit devices. The reason for such measures is that excise duty is extremely expensive, in most EU countries accounting for around half the market price of the product.\n\nExcise stamps are most commonly found on tobacco and alcohol products, which reach the consumer in neatly packaged units (namely packets and bottles) to which the adhesive stamp is easily affixed. Since counterfeit alcohol and cigarettes are extremely common in many countries, the presence of a genuine excise stamp also goes some way towards guaranteeing the genuineness of the product, as only certified producers may legally buy excise stamps. (However, illegally obtained or counterfeit stamps are common in some countries.)\n\nManufacturers will buy a certain quantity of excise stamps from the government at their excise value which they are then obliged to affix to every packet of cigarettes or bottle of spirits produced. The excise stamps are ideally affixed with strong glue over the cap of a bottle or across the lid of a box of cigarettes (and underneath the plastic/foil wrapper on the bottleneck or the cellophane of the cigarette-box) in such a way that they are destroyed when the product is opened. This is so that they cannot be reused, since this would constitute contraband.\n\nIn countries where excise stamps are required, all cigarettes and alcohol produced legally will bear a stamp. Some countries have separate stamps for domestically-produced and imported excisable goods; others require separate stamps for products destined for duty-free sale, which are still subject to excise but not VAT; some countries do not require stamps for wines, while others do.\n\nIn the UK, excise stamps have been in use for spirits since 2006. While these are usually printed on the back label of the bottle by the manufacturer rather than being a special security bought from the government, they still have to adhere to strict specifications, such as containing UV-visible inks. UK law does not require such physical stamps for cigarettes, either - instead, the words \"UK Duty Paid\" are printed in bold on all packs as part of the manufacturing process, while other forms of control are implemented by HM Revenue & Customs to verify that this is indeed the case. Meanwhile, foreign-bought cigarette packets bearing revenue stamps can be widely seen across the UK, mainly due to the comparatively high price of British cigarettes, leading people to (often illegally) import them from abroad.\n\nRussian excise stamps (2000s)\n\n"}

{"id": "10869922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10869922", "title": "Gender in English", "text": "Gender in English\n\nA system of grammatical gender, whereby every noun was treated as either masculine, feminine or neuter, existed in Old English, but fell out of use during the Middle English period. Modern English retains features relating to natural gender, namely the use of certain nouns and pronouns (such as \"he\" and \"she\") to refer specifically to persons or animals of one or other genders and certain others (such as \"it\") for sexless objects – although feminine pronouns are sometimes used when referring to ships (and more uncommonly some airplanes and analogous machinery) and nation states.\n\nSome aspects of gender usage in English have been influenced by the movement towards a preference for gender-neutral language. This applies in particular to avoidance of the default use of the masculine \"he\" when referring to a person of unknown gender, usually using the neuter \"they\" as a third-person singular, and avoidance of the use of certain feminine forms of nouns (such as \"authoress\" and \"poetess\"). Increasingly, the \"male\" form of such nouns is used for both men and women.\n\nOld English had a system of grammatical gender similar to that of modern German, with three genders: masculine, feminine, neuter. Determiners and attributive adjectives showed gender inflection in agreement with the noun they modified. Also the nouns themselves followed different declension patterns depending on their gender. Moreover, the third-person personal pronouns, as well as interrogative and relative pronouns, were chosen according to the grammatical gender of their antecedent.\n\nOld English grammatical gender was, as in other Germanic languages, remarkably opaque, that is, one often could not know the gender of a noun by its meaning or by the form of the word; this was especially true for nouns referencing inanimate objects. Learners would have had to simply memorize which word goes with which gender. Though nouns referring to human males were generally masculine and for the most part the masculine went with human males and the feminine went with human females, as Charles Jones noted, \"it is with those nouns which show explicit female reference that the sex specifying function of the gender classification system appears to break down...\" Most words referencing human females were feminine, but there was a sizable number of words that were either neuter or even masculine. Here are the discrepant nouns referring specifically to human females as listed by Jones:\n\nOld English had multiple generic nouns for \"woman\" stretching across all 3 genders: for example, in addition to the neuter \"wif\" and the masculine \"wifmann\" listed above, there was also the feminine \"frowe\". For the gender-neutral nouns for \"child\", there was the feminine \"byren\" in addition to the neuter \"bearn\" and the neuter \"cild\" (compare English \"child\"). And even with nouns referring to persons, one could not always determine gender by meaning or form: for example, with 2 words ending in \"-mæg\", there was the female-specific neuter noun \"wynmæg\", meaning \"winsome maid\" or attractive woman; as well as the gender-neutral noun meaning \"paternal kindred\" or member of father's side of the family, but which was grammatically feminine: \"fædernmæg\".\n\nFor details of the declension patterns and pronoun systems, see Old English grammar.\n\nBy the 11th century, the role of grammatical gender in Old English was beginning to decline. The Middle English of the 13th century was in transition to the loss of a gender system. One element of this process was the change in the functions of the words \"the\" and \"that\" (then spelt \"þe\" and \"þat\"; see also Old English determiners): previously these had been non-neuter and neuter forms respectively of a single determiner, but in this period \"the\" came to be used generally as a definite article and \"that\" as a demonstrative; both thus ceased to manifest any gender differentiation. The loss of gender classes was part of a general decay of inflectional endings and declensional classes by the end of the 14th century. While inflectional reduction seems to have been incipient in the English language itself, some theories suggest that it was accelerated by contact with Old Norse, especially in midland and northern dialects.\n\nGender loss began in the north of England; the south-east and the south-west Midlands were the most linguistically conservative regions, and Kent retained traces of gender in the 1340s. Late 14th-century London English had almost completed the shift away from grammatical gender, and Modern English retains no morphological agreement of words with grammatical gender.\n\nGender is no longer an inflectional category in Modern English. The only traces of the Old English gender system are found in the system of pronoun–antecedent agreement, although this is now based on natural gender – the sex, gender identity, or perceived sexual characteristics, of the pronoun's referent. Another manifestation of natural gender that continues to function in English is the use of certain nouns to refer specifically to persons or animals of a particular sex: \"widow/widower\", \"actor/actress\", etc.\n\nBenjamin Whorf described grammatical gender in English as a covert grammatical category. He noted that gender as a property inherent in nouns (rather than in their referents) is not entirely absent from modern English: different pronouns may be appropriate for the same referent depending on what noun has been used.\n\nThe third-person singular personal pronouns are chosen according to the natural gender of their antecedent or referent. As a general rule:\n\nPronoun agreement is often with the natural gender of the referent (the person or thing denoted) rather than simply the antecedent (a noun or noun phrase which the pronoun replaces). For example, one might say either \"the doctor and his patients\" or \"the doctor and her patients\", depending on one's knowledge or assumptions about the sex of the doctor in question, as the phrase \"the doctor\" (the antecedent) does not itself have any specific natural gender. Also, pronouns are sometimes used without any explicit antecedent. However, as noted above (the example with \"child\" and \"daughter\"), the choice of pronoun may also be affected by the particular noun used in the antecedent.\n\nBecause there is no third-person singular gender-neutral pronoun for animate referents, problems arise when the referent is a person of unknown or unspecified sex. Traditionally the male forms \"he\" etc. or the singular \"they\" have been used in such situations, but in contemporary English (partly because of the movement towards gender-neutral language) the male forms are often avoided in this context, although they are still considered proper. Possible alternatives include:\n\nAlthough the use of \"she\" and \"he\" for inanimate objects is not very frequent in Standard Modern English, it is in fact fairly widespread in some varieties of English. Gender assignment to inanimate nouns in these dialects is sometimes fairly systematic. For example, in some dialects of southwest England, masculine pronouns are used for individuated or countable matter, such as iron tools, while the neuter form is used for non-individuated matter, such as liquids, fire and other substances.\n\nIn principle, animals are triple-gender nouns, being able to take masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns. However, animals viewed as less important to humans, also known as ‘lower animals’, are generally referred to using \"it\"; higher (domestic) animals may more often be referred to using \"he\" and \"she\", when their sex is known. If the sex of the animal is not known, the masculine pronoun is often used with a sex-neutral meaning. For example,\n\n\"Person A: Ah there’s an ant\"\n\n\"Person B: Well put him outside\"\n\nAnimate pronouns \"he\" and \"she\" are usually applied to animals when personification and/or individuation occurs. Personification occurs whenever human attributes are applied to the noun. For example:\n\nSpecifically named animals are an example of individuation, such as \"Peter Rabbit\" or \"Blob the Whale\". In these instances, it is more likely that animate pronouns \"he\" or \"she\" will be used to represent them.\n\nThese rules also apply to other triple-gender nouns, including ideas, inanimate objects, and words like \"infant\" and \"child\".\n\nTraditionally, oceans, countries, and ships, even those named after men such as USS \"Barry\", have been referred to using the feminine pronouns. This usage is currently in decline (though still more common for ships, particularly in nautical usage, than for countries); in American English it is advised against by \"The Chicago Manual of Style\".\n\nSome genderqueer or similarly-identified people prefer not to use either \"he\" or \"she\", but a different pronoun such as they, \"zie\", or so forth.\n\nOther English pronouns are not subject to male/female distinctions, although in some cases a distinction between animate and inanimate referents is made. For example, the word \"who\" (as an interrogative or relative pronoun) refers to a person or people, and rarely to animals (although the possessive form \"whose\" can be used as a relative pronoun even when the antecedent is inanimate), while \"which\" and \"what\" refer to inanimate things (and non-human animals). Since these pronouns function on a binary gender system, distinguishing only between animate and inanimate entities, this suggests that English has a second gender system which contrasts with the primary gender system.\nIt should also be noted that relative and interrogative pronouns do not encode number. This is shown in the following example:\n\n\"The man who lost his head \"vs.\" the men who lost their heads\"\n\nOther pronouns which show a similar distinction include \"everyone/everybody\" vs. \"everything\", \"no one/nobody\" vs. \"nothing\", etc.\n\nMany words in modern English refer specifically to people or animals of a particular sex, although sometimes the specificity is being lost (for example, \"duck\" need not refer exclusively to a female bird; cf. Donald Duck). Likewise, many feminine and masculine job titles (steward/stewardess, waiter/waitress) have undergone a process of becoming gender-neutralised in recent decades (see below).\n\nAn example of an English word that has retained gender-specific spellings is the noun-form of blond/blonde, with the former being masculine and the latter being feminine.\n\nGender neutrality in English became a growing area of interest among academics during Second Wave Feminism, when the work of structuralist linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, and his theories on semiotics, became more well known in academic circles. By the 1960s and 1970s, post-structuralist theorists, particularly in France, brought wider attention to gender-neutrality theory, and the concept of supporting gender equality through conscious changes to language. Feminists analyzing the English language put forward their own theories about the power of language to create and enforce gender determinism and the marginalization of the feminine. Debates touched on such issues as changing the term \"stewardess\" to the gender-neutral \"flight attendant\", \"fireman\" to \"fire fighter\", \"mailman\" to \"mail carrier\", and so on. At the root of this contentiousness may have been feminists' backlash against the English language's shift from \"grammatical gender\" to \"natural gender\" during the early Modern era coinciding with the spread of institutional prescriptive grammar rules in English schools. These theories have been challenged by some researchers, with attention given to additional possible social, ethnic, economic, and cultural influences on language and gender. The impact on mainstream language has been limited, yet has led to lasting changes in practice.\n\nFeatures of gender-neutral language in English may include:\n\nCertain naming practices (such as the use of \"Mrs\" and \"Miss\" to distinguish married and unmarried women) may also be discouraged on similar grounds. For more details and examples, see Gender neutrality in English.\n\n\n"}

He was President of the Welsh political party Plaid Cymru for thirty six years and was the first Member of Parliament to represent it at Westminster, which he did twice, from 1966 to 1970, and again from 1974 to 1979.\n\nGwynfor Evans was born in Barry, near Cardiff, to Dan Evans and Catherine Richard. He had a brother named Alcwyn, and a sister named Ceridwen. His father ran a chain of shops in Barry, and his mother a china shop. His mother was a fluent Welsh speaker. As a boy, he was educated at Gladstone Road School. Later on he was educated at Barry County School, where he was captain of the school's cricket and hockey teams. At the school he began learning the Welsh language, but did not become fully fluent until the age of seventeen.\n\nEvans studied at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth and at St John's College, Oxford, from where he qualified as a lawyer. During his time at St John's, he became a member of the Dafydd ap Gwilym society there. He was also a market gardener. He was a teenager when the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru was founded in 1925, and he founded a branch of the party while he was at Oxford. He became the party's president in 1945 and retained the office until 1981.\n\nA pacifist, he became active in Heddychwyr Cymru, a Welsh organisation closely associated with the Peace Pledge Union, serving as secretary and editor of a series of pamphlets throughout the Second World War. A committed Christian also, he declared himself a conscientious objector, and was required to appear before a tribunal which, recognising the firmness of his beliefs, registered him unconditionally.\n\nEvans is credited with keeping Plaid Cymru going through the lean years of the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, he campaigned unsuccessfully for a Welsh parliament, and failed to prevent the damming of the Tryweryn River and consequent inundation of the Welsh-speaking community of Capel Celyn to supply the city of Liverpool with water, a \"cause célèbre\" in Wales in the early 1960s.\n\nIn 1962, Wales West and North Television, a group in which Evans was one of the leading figures, won the ITV franchise for western and northern Wales, but the venture failed because of financial difficulties, and the company was merged with Television Wales and the West, with western and northern Wales merged with the rest of Wales and the West of England,\nas a separate sub-region.\n\nEvans was elected to Carmarthenshire County Council in 1949, keeping his seat for the next 25 years, usually as the lone Plaid Cymru representative, acquiring the nickname \"Evans dual carriageway\" for his emphasis on improving transport links. In 1973, following the abolition of Carmarthenshire County Council, Evans failed to be elected to the new Dyfed County Council. Evans contested Merioneth at the general elections of 1945, 1950, 1955 and 1959, and the Aberdare by-election, 1954.\n\nIn 1964 Evans transferred his candidature to Carmarthen. On 14 July 1966, Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen from Labour in a by-election caused by the death of Lady Megan Lloyd George, daughter of the former Liberal Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, having come third in the general election just a few weeks before. He had also contested the seat at the 1964 general election. His by-election victory is regarded as a seminal moment for Plaid Cymru. He was shown around the House of Commons by fellow pacifist Emrys Hughes, the son-in-law of Keir Hardie; on pointing out the Welsh Labour table in the Commons' tea room, Hughes warned him, \"You'd better not sit down there, your name's mud among that lot.\"\n\nIn the 1970 general election Evans lost his Carmarthen seat to Labour's Gwynoro Jones and failed to regain it in the February 1974 general election by only three votes. He regained the seat, with a majority of 3,640 votes, in the October 1974 general election, when he returned to Parliament accompanied by two other Plaid Cymru MPs, Dafydd Wigley and Dafydd Elis Thomas.\n\nEvans lost Carmarthen once more at the 1979 general election, to Dr Roger Thomas (also Labour). He was unsuccessful in the 1983 general election, and did not contest any further elections.\n\nIn the House of Commons, Evans was true to his pacifist principles in being one of the few MPs to oppose the British government's support of the Nigerian federal government with supplies of weapons in the civil war against Biafra (1967–1970). He also opposed the Vietnam War: after being denied entry to the country as part of an inspection group, he instead protested outside a US air base in Thailand.\n\nEvans was the first (and last) president of the Celtic League 1961–71. Dr. Robert McIntyre of the SNP was vice-president at the time.\n\nIn 1980, his threat to go on hunger strike, after the Conservative government reneged on its election promise of a Welsh language television channel, was instrumental in bringing about an early U-turn on the part of Margaret Thatcher, and S4C began broadcasting on 1 November 1982.\n\nIn his political retirement he became a prolific writer, mainly on Welsh subjects and writing in Welsh with simultaneous or later English editions. His work \"Aros Mae\" (\"It Endures\") (published 1971), a comprehensive history of Wales, and the English-language version \"Land of my Fathers: 2000 Years of Welsh History\" (published 1974), had already become best-sellers.\n\nIn 1941 Evans married Rhiannon Prys Thomas, who survived him by nine months, dying on 13 January 2006. They had seven children. Their daughter, Meinir, became a prominent Welsh-language activist, and married Ffred Ffransis.\n\nOn 21 April 2005, Evans died at his home in Pencarreg, at the age of 92.\n\nOn his death the Welsh political establishment united in paying its respects to Gwynfor Evans:\n\n\n\n"}

He published his first poetry book, \"Harpas Selvagens\" (\"Wild Harps\"), in 1857. He travelled to many countries, such as France (where he graduated in Linguistics and mining engineering at Sorbonne) and the United States, where he settled in 1871. It was while in the U.S.A. that he wrote \"Guesa\", an epic poem based on a Quechua legend about a teenager Indian who is going to be sacrificed to the Sun God. \"Guesa\" is characterized by the employment of neologisms and vertiginous metaphors; thus, it is considered by some critics a precursor work of Modernism, however this was only acknowledged decades after his death. From 1871 to 1879 he was secretary and collaborator for the periodical \"O Novo Mundo\", directed by José Carlos Rodrigues in New York City.\n\nReturning to Maranhão, in order to commemorate the proclamation of the republic in Brazil, he became president of the mayor's office of São Luís in 1890. He founded many schools, realized reforms in the education and idealized the flag of Maranhão. He also planned to be a senator in 1890, but quit before the elections were held.\n\nSousândrade died poor, forgotten and allegedly mentally ill in São Luís, in 1902. His works, forgotten for decades, were only rediscovered in the 1960s and the 1970s, thanks to the efforts of Augusto and Haroldo de Campos. Ironically, he has said once of his poem \"Guesa\", in 1877:\n\n\n\n"}

The new name was transliterated in Komi as \"коми-пермяцкöй кыв\" 'Komi-Permyak language'. In this way the local language was nominally separated from the Komi-Zyrian language, that officially received the original name \"коми кыв\". The Komis of Region Perm had to officially use the new name, even though it has negative connotations for the speakers, continuing in their colloquial speech to use exclusively the original name of their language as \"коми кыв\".\n\nOnly in the early 2000s (decade) has started a controversial process of replacing the offensive official name by a more correct one. The term \"перем коми кыв\" 'Permian Komi language' was proposed and it is used nowadays (alongside the old term) in local mass-media, in scientific papers and in the Komi-Permyak Wikipedia.\n\nAll of the Komi-Permyak dialects are easily intelligible with one another and to some extent with the Komi-Zyrian dialects.\n\nThe Komi-Permyak dialects might be divided geographically into Northern and Southern groups, and phonemically into /l/ and /v/ groups:\n\n1. Northern\n\n2. Southern\nEarlier there was a southern group too, in the Obva river basin, but now it is nearly extinct. Its only remaining member, the Nerdva dialect, is usually considered together with the central group, which in this way became \"southern\".\n\nThe central (new southern) and northern groups of Komi-Permyak are spoken in Komi Okrug of Perm Krai, where the language was standardized in the 1920s. The modern standard is based on Kudymkar dialect of the central group, but many elements of northern dialects were included as well, so that the \"literary language\" has significant differences in its morphological system from the \"main\" dialect.\n\nThe central dialects, spoken in the Ińva river basin, differ considerably from the other Komi-Permyak dialects due to the general shift of etymological /l/ to /v/, then to /w/, and finally to the disappearance of the consonant, which has triggered significant changes in morphology.\n\nThe differences between the Kudymkar and Uliś Ińva dialects are mainly in accentuation: the Uliś Ińva has a phonological stress (the Öń too), whereas the Kudymkar dialect (like as Ńerdva) has a morphological one. The Ńerdva dialect retains the etymological /l/. The same can be said about the Öń dialect (recently extinct), that had connections with the eastern Permian.\n\nThe northern group of the Permian dialects (upon Kösva, Kama and Lup rivers) was under a strong Zyrian influence on all the levels. The Köć and Kös dialects are closely related with some Syktyv dialects of Zyrian, whereas the Lup dialect for a long time was in tenuous connections with the Upper Ezhva dialect.\n\nThe Komi-Permyak standard language refers only to the central and northern groups of the Komi-Permyak dialects. They can be called as proper Permian dialects. The other two groups are marginal.\n\nAn only relic of the eastern Permian is the Yaźva dialect, ca. 200 speakers of the ca. 900 ethnical Komis in Krasnovishersky District of Perm Krai. In the early 2000s (decade) it was standardized by authority of the krai. The dialect has archaic system of vowels (including /ö/, /ü/ and /ʌ/), while its accentuation is similar to Uliś Ińva's and its lexical system likes the Northern Permian one.\n\nThe Western Permian group is presented by another marginal dialect, Źuźdin (ca. 1000 person living in Kirov Oblast near the border of Komi Okrug).\n\nIn the Komi-Permyak standard language there are the same 26 main consonants and 7 vowels as in Komi-Zyrian.\n\nKomi-Permyak's modern consonant system includes 26 native ones, and the additional consonants /ts/, /f/, /x/ in Russian loanwords. In traditional speech the \"foreign sounds\" were replaced with respectively /t͡ɕ/, /p/, and /k/, respectively.\n\nThe Komi-Permyak vowel system can be considered as being three-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by three features: front and back, rounded and unrounded and vowel height.\n\nKomi-Permyak does not distinguish between long and short vowels and does not have vowel harmony. There are no diphthongs; when two vowels come together, which occurs at some morpheme boundaries, each vowel retains its individual sound.\n\nThe both regional standards of the Komi language have an identical alphabet, introduced in 1938. The alphabet (анбур) includes all the Russian letters plus two additional graphemes: і and ӧ.\n\nKomi alphabet (Коми анбур)\nKomi is an agglutinating language. It uses affixes to express possession, to specify mode, time, and so on.\n\nAll Permian Komi nouns are declined for number, case and possession, adding special suffixes to word stem.\n\nIn Permian Komi there are two grammatical numbers: singular and plural. The singular is the unmarked form of a word, and the plural is obtained by inflecting the singular.\n\nThe plural marker of nouns is /ez/ (orthographically эз or ез) immediately following a word stem before any case or other affixes. The last consonant of the stem before the plural suffix has to be duplicated.\n\nThe plural suffix has also a reduced variant (a \"weak form\") /е/ (orth. э or е), that is used combining with some weak forms of possessive suffixes, e.g. киэт 'your (Sg.) hands ' versa киэз 'hands'.\n\nThe Permian Komi possessive suffixes are added to the end of nouns either before or after a case suffix depending of case. The three suffixes of singular possession have in addition to their main forms the weak variants used combining with a weak form of plural suffix, weak forms of some cases or forming the suffixes of plural possession.\n\nThe possessive suffix of 3Sg is widely used also as a definite article. In colloquial speech it is the main meaning of this suffix.\n\nIt is assumed, that the Permian Komi standard language has eighteen noun cases: ten grammatical cases and eight locative cases. The disputes continue about the status of some monosyllabic postpositions and a set of dialectal reduced forms of postpositions that can be treated as case suffixes too. The maximal amount of all possible cases reaches 30.\n\nThe case suffixes are added to the end of nouns either before or after a possessive suffix depending of case. Some cases have weak variants of their suffixes combining with the weak variants of possessive suffixes.\n\nUsed attributively, Permian Komi adjectives precede the nouns they modify, and are not declined: басöк нывка 'beautiful girl' → басöк нывкаэслö 'to the beautiful girls'.\n\nHowever most adjectives can also be used as nouns and sometimes as appositions, in which case they are declined: e.g. ыджыт (\"big\") → ыджыттэзісь (\"out of the bigs\"). The declensional paradigma is the same as by nouns, except the main accusative form, that became by adjectives suffix ö instead of öс or a null morpheme by nouns: адззи басöк нывкаöс 'I have found a beautiful girl' → адззи басöкö 'I have found a beautiful [girl]'.\n\nBeing predicative an adjective agrees with the subject for number. The plural marker of the predicative is öсь: керкуыс ыджыт 'the house is big ' → керкуэc ыджытöсь 'the houses are big'.\n\nThe adjective in Permian Komi have five degrees of comparison\n\nThe comparative and the superlative compare the intensity of an object's quality with the other object's one. The sative, excessive and diminutive compare the intensity of the quality with its basic degree.\n\nThe numerals in Komi-Permyak \n\nKomi personal pronouns inflect in all the cases. The language makes no distinction between \"he\",\" she\" and \"it\". The nominative case of personal pronouns are listed in the following table:\n\nPermian Komi verbs show tense (present, future, past), mood (indicative, imperative, evidential, optative, conditional and conjunctive), voice and aspect.\n\nThe verbal stem is a 2ed person singular of imperative mode: мун 'go', кер 'make'. All the other forms are formed by adding suffixes to the stem.\n\nSome verbal stems having a consonant cluster at the end become expanded with a so-called \"voyelle de soutien\" ы which is dropped before the suffixes beginning with a vowel: кывзы = кывз+ы 'hear', видчы 'swear' = видч+ы, e. g. кывзыны 'to hear', кывзытöн 'by hearing' but кывзі 'I heard', кывзö 'he hears', кывзан 'you hear'. Thus, these stems with a consonant cluster have their full und reduced variants.\n\nPermian infinitives are marked with -ны added to a stem as in мyнны 'to go', кывзыны 'hear'\n\nAll Permian Komi verbs are conjugated in the same way, except for the defective verb вöвны 'to be'.\n\nNegation is mostly expressed by a conjugated negator preceding the stem, e. g. эг мун 'I didn't go'.\n\nThe indicative mood has three tenses: present, future and past. The main marker of the present and future tense is а (negat. о), the marker of the past tense is и (negat. э).\n\nHere is conjugation of verb керны 'make, do':\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1365953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1365953", "title": "Likbez", "text": "Likbez\n\nLikbez (, ; from a Russian abbreviation for \"likvidatsiya bezgramotnosti\", ликвида́ция безгра́мотности, , meaning \"elimination of illiteracy\") was a campaign of eradication of illiteracy in Soviet Russia and Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s. The term was also used for various schools and courses established during the campaign. Nowadays this term is sometimes used in Russian as a slang for answers on common questions.\n\nIn 1897, the overall literacy rate of the Russian Empire was an estimated 24%, with the rural literacy rate at 19.7%. There were few schools available to the population, particularly in rural areas. Until the early 20th century, there were still no specific curricular plans or guidelines in the zemstvo schools. In 1891, the literacy schools came under church administration, and maintained a largely religious curriculum, which emphasized the teaching of old Church Slavonic. The peasantry was largely self-educated, and often relied on schools run by political dissidents for the latter period of tsarist rule. Facing a growing opposition from the general populace, Tsar Alexander II announced a decree that would raise the tuition fee for schools, thus preventing further social mobility for serfs who were allowed free mobility. During the reign of Tsar Nicholas II (1894–1917) liberals pushed for a universal education system, which scholars predict may have expanded if it were not for World War I.\n\nWhen the Bolshevik Party came to power in 1917, they faced a crumbling empire infamous for its perceived backwardness and poor education system. In 1917, within the remaining Tsarist territories, an estimated 37.9% of the male population above seven years old was literate and only 12.5% of the female population was literate.\nLenin's views on literacy were rooted in its economic and political benefits. \"Without literacy,\" he declared, \"There can be no politics, there can only be rumors, gossip and prejudice.\" The Likbez campaign was started on December 26, 1919, when Vladimir Lenin signed the Decree of the Soviet government \"On eradication of illiteracy among the population of RSFSR\" (\"О ликвидации безграмотности среди населения РСФСР\"). According to this decree, all people from 8 to 50 years old were required to become literate in their native language. 40,000 liquidation points (ликпункты) were arranged to serve as centers for education, and achieving literacy.\n\nFighting for time and funding during the ensuing Russian Civil War of 1917–23, Narkompros, the Soviet Ministry of Education, quickly assembled the Cheka Likbez (an acronym for the \"Extraordinary Commission for the Liquidation of Illiteracy\") which was to be responsible for the training of literacy teachers as well as organizing and propagating the literacy campaign. From the peasantry to trade unions, specific literacy percentage quotas were made for different sectors of Soviet society. For example, the trade union campaign aimed for 100% literacy for its workers by 1923. The Bolsheviks also believed that through literary campaigns they could easily promote Party ideology and shape the population's outlook. Women, given their low literacy rate, were regarded as having the highest potential for becoming the \"modernizers\" of Soviet society. Through the education of peasant women, the Bolsheviks hoped to break down the patriarchal domination of rural society. Lenin had written in The Emancipation of Women that a woman's illiteracy would impair the \"fighting spirit\" of male party members and prevent wives from grasping their husbands' ideals. In the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, the women's literacy campaign was largely carried out by members of the Ali Bayramov Club, a women's organization founded by Azeri Bolshevik women in Baku in 1920.\n\nTo further extend their reach to the peasant community, the Bolsheviks built reading rooms in villages across the country. Serving as a propaganda center rather than library, a literate peasant would act as the room's \"Red Reader\" and lead discussions on texts sent by the Party directive with members of the local community. Attendance was most often mandatory, as the reading rooms proved to be one of the Party's most successful propaganda tools, where campaigns would take shape and the locals would hear about happenings in the outside world.\n\nBy 1923, however, it was clear that the campaign had its shortcomings. For one thing, Narkompros was having difficulty competing for funding from the Politburo. The Narkompros budget for literacy education dropped from 2.8% in 1924-5 to 1.6% in 1927–8. Likbez literary schools were not established locally by order of Party elites—instead, they relied heavily on grassroots demand. Narkompros also found it hard to find educated teachers actually willing to live in the isolated conditions of the countryside.\n\nIn many cases, peasant and proletariat students met their educators and literacy teachers with hostility due to their \"petty bourgeois\" backgrounds. To solve this problem, local governments established a system of rewards for workers who attended class, granting special privileges to those who did. In some extreme cases, during the 1922 famine, many districts required their illiterate male and female populations to attend literacy school in order to earn their food points. Fearing they were not reaching out to the population and making the popular reading frenzy that they had hoped, the Politburo decided to heavily fund and promote clubs and societies such as the \"Down with Illiteracy\" society.\n\nPro-literacy propaganda came into popular Soviet culture with the government's policy of \"likbez\" rooted in the Bolshevik push for mass literacy directly following the Bolshevik rise to power. After the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the Soviet People's Commissariat for Education made a conscious effort to introduce political propaganda into Soviet schools, particularly the labour schools that had been established in 1918 with the \"Statutniihge of the Uniform Labour School\" decree. These propaganda pamphlets, required texts, and posters artistically embodied the core values of the Soviet push for literacy in both rural and urban settings, namely the concept espoused by Lenin that \"Without literacy, there can be no politics, there can only be rumors, gossip and prejudice.\" This concept, the Soviet valuing of literacy, was later echoed in works like Trotsky's 1924 Literature and Revolution, in which Trotsky describes literature and reading as driving forces in the forging of a new Communist man.\n\nIn the early years of the Likbez campaign, the State compulsarily enrolled millions of illiterate Soviets from both town and country in literacy schools, requiring these citizens to engage with the Leninist ideology of pro-literacy. In this period, Komsomol members and Young Pioneer detachments were also commissioned to spread pro-literacy propaganda in the form of pamphlets and word of mouth to village illiterates. Initial pro-literacy propaganda efforts included instituting spaces in villages, particularly, that would facilitate the spread of literacy through the countryside. For example, in the early 1920s, Bolsheviks built \"Red Rooms,\" reading rooms in villages across Russia, to serve as propaganda centers by which texts sent by the Party were disseminated to local communities. In children's education, particularly, inoculation of illiteracy was presented by the State as a means by which children could most fully develop desirable qualities such as curiosity and patience. For children, the most widely used books in the early Likbez campaign to promote literacy were the Bible, \"Kniga Svyashchennogo Chtenia\" (Book of Holy Reading), \"Detsky Mir\" (Children's World) and \"Rodnoe Slovo\" (Native Word) by Konstantin D. Ushinsky. God and divine will were a common pro-literacy motif in propaganda throughout the Likbez campaign, but were especially present in its pre-1920 phase.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Bolshevik government emphasized local initiatives and de-emphasized centralized State control to parallel Lenin's New Economic Policy that had been instituted in 1921. It was in this atmosphere that the Soviet government's Commissariat of Enlightenment most heavily launched its methodical literacy campaign by the Spring of 1923. The height of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic's (RSFR) People's Commissariat of Enlightenment (\"Narkompros\") literacy campaign lasted until the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, 7 November 1927.\n\nFrom 1923-1927, Soviet pro-literacy propaganda became especially pushed by the Cheka's \"likbez\" agencies among Russian Trade Unions. In the pro-literacy propaganda campaigns within trade Unions, the Party-line contained in pamphlets and other pieces of propaganda focused on \"true literacy\" as the ideal literacy level for workers, a commitment that would require 6–8 months of additional enrollment in Union-sponsored literacy schools after a worker had initially achieved \"semi literacy.\" In the mid-1920s, Cheka likbez commissions would routinely seek and publish reports of literacy rates from Unions as a means of spreading a competitive desire for literacy between towns and factories. In these reports, illiteracy was painted as a \"weak opponent\" to be overcome in a short period of time by reading State literature in libraries and \"Red Rooms\" or red corners. The Russian Transport Union, with its educational administration's 40-50 million ruble annual spending capacity, was largely in charge of seeing to the promulgation of literacy initiatives, transmission of pro-literacy pamphlets, and dissemination of books and reading materials to Union-sponsored schools.\n\nThroughout the 1920s, spreading literacy in the Soviet transportation sector through the building of Union schools held symbolic importance for the State as a means of propaganda in and of itself. By promoting literacy in transport workers, specifically, the Komsomol and Cheka likbez units hoped to achieve symbolic victories in signaling the Likbez campaign's overall success. Even in the early Likbez campaign, the transportation sector already experienced relatively low illiteracy rates in workers due to the reading necessary to operate modes of transportation. As such, achieving high literacy in this population was a relatively easy goal and would show the Likbez campaign's success in a widespread and visible industry.\n\nState-sponsored prescriptive materials in the 1920s concerning the plight of the domestic worker had a specific focus on literacy stemming from Union membership. These short stories, chastushki, poems, cartoons, and plays were spread through pamphlets, journals, and wall newspapers and were usually tales about young, single, illiterate women from the countryside. In these pieces of propaganda, it was when the downtrodden women became acquainted with local Soviet officials that the women's luck began to change. In the plot lines of most of these works, the main characters, who had usually fled their countryside homes after being taken advantage of sexually, experienced reversals of fortunes after meeting Soviet officials in their new, urban homes. These officials would rescue the women from the abuses they were suffering as ill-paid and ill-respected domestic servants by encouraging the women to join a Union. At this point in the story, the women would receive not only Union protection but also an education as a result of Union membership and access to Union schools and reading materials. Ultimately, the story's heroine, the domestic worker, would become fully literate as well as active in her local worker's committee (\"mestkom\"). Often, the women in these works of pro-literacy propaganda were portrayed as using their new literacy and subsequent heightened foothold in Union society to become Soviet delegates themselves and help second generations of downtrodden women by teaching them to read and write. In these rags to riches propaganda tales, literacy was the vehicle by which women were able to lift up their status as workers within Unions and Soviet society. In 1924, 90% of domestic workers coming from villages were illiterate and were referred to in Soviet literature and propaganda as the \"third front,\" a subset of the population which needed to be raised up through literacy. The focus on spreading the desire for literacy among trade unions through pamphlets, building of schools, and the dissemination of state-approved literature largely petered out by 1925 when Cheka likbez realized it could not achieve its high literary goals by 1933, the date of the Narkompros deadline for compulsory secondary education throughout the Soviet Union. After 1925, greater flexibility in literacy class structures and attendance within Soviet trade unions was gradually introduced.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, posters had become a \"quintessential form of propaganda\" in Likbez. Throughout the 1920s, though pro-literacy propaganda was still taking on its earlier forms, it was increasingly contained in propaganda posters.\n\nAs Stalin consolidated his power through the late 1920s, Soviet propaganda largely shifted its focus to center on rapid industrialization and centralized, State control of the economy. By the 1930s, the dissemination of pro-literacy propaganda had slowed throughout the Soviet Union. The bodies for promoting literacy whose establishment Likbez had catalyzed throughout the Soviet Union remained in place, but the push for pro-literacy propaganda was not occurring with the same fervor as it had in the previous decade. Indeed, throughout the 1930s, propaganda became increasingly focused on glorifying the Soviet State, particularly its leader Joseph Stalin.\n\nPro-literacy propaganda posters were a cheap way for the State Publishing House in Leningrad and other Soviet State bodies to reach a wide audience. Moreover, posters could be understood even by illiterate citizens. Propaganda posters had been an important weapon for the Bolsheviks during the Civil War 1918-1921, but they remained in use even after the war's conclusion. After the Civil War and Lenin's institution of the NEP Policy, propaganda posters began increasingly depicting the reforging of Soviet everyday life or \"byt\"\".\"\n\nPropaganda posters of the 1920s focused on the need to build a new world and way of life after the destruction of the Civil War. While the Bolsheviks were experienced in the use of print media to spread ideas, they recognized that print media could not work to imprint Soviet ideology on the USSR as a whole, since most Soviets were illiterate and could not even understand Soviet staple texts such as those of Marx or Lenin.\n\nDue to the prevalence of religion in mass Russian pre-revolutionary culture, Soviet citizens were used to looking at religious icons and learning from the images and symbolism that they saw. Much like the Orthodox Church had done with icons, the Soviet State used propaganda posters to \"present symbols in a simple and easily identifiable way, even to barely literate peasants\". Pro-literacy propaganda posters sold Communist ideology to the population by portraying the benefits of literacy to individuals, specifically. In the early years of the Soviet Union, particularly in the early-mid 1920s, propaganda posters were used to spread literacy while at the same time indoctrinating the masses in Marxist–Leninist thought.\n\nWomen, particularly, became motifs in Soviet pro-literacy propaganda. In pro-literacy propaganda, the Bolshevik commitment to female literacy was used to underscore the party's commitment to improving women's station in Soviet society. \"Zhenotdel\", the Russian Soviet Party's women's section, was a particular force in disseminating pro-literacy pamphlets and posters during the height of the Likbez campaign.\n\nThe use of women as main characters was a key element of Likbez-era propaganda literature. The plot line of women improving their stations in Soviet society through literacy was first introduced in the widely disseminated rags-to-riches tales of domestic workers in the early 1920s. For example, on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the Russian decree on literacy (December 1924), the State commissioning body of Ivanovo-Voznesensk (the \"guberniia\") published a pamphlet which linked women's lag in reaching full equality to their husbands with women's ignorance and illiteracy. By achieving literacy, the pamphlet's main character Riabnkova is able to gain autonomy and escape the clutches of her overbearing husband to become a contributing member of Soviet society.\n\nMoreover, images of women became central to Soviet pro-literacy propaganda posters during the Likbez campaign. In these posters, women were shown distributing books, teaching children how to read, and generally engaging with the Soviet ideals of education and literacy. Prior to 1920, women's representation in political posters was mostly allegorical. It was not until 1920 that Soviet artists generated a female counterpart for the commonly-used imagery of the male worker or blacksmith that had come into widespread use in post-Civil War propaganda. After 1920, the imagery of women in propaganda posters began to shift to that of the woman worker, a new Soviet woman. Though some allegorical representations of women subsisted in propaganda posters and art through the early 1920s, the new depictions of women found in Likbez-era posters were of women in plain dress, \"industrious women workers and peasant women, building socialism alongside their male counterparts.\" Throughout the Likbez campaign, the building of socialism in which women were depicted as taking part was the spread of literacy. Though representation of the woman worker waned in its prevalence in political propaganda during the NEP-era, the representation of women and books remained a mainstay in pro-literacy Likbez-era propaganda through the 1920s and into the 1930s.\n\nWomen, given their low literacy rate, were regarded by the State as having the highest potential for becoming the \"modernizers\" of Soviet society. Reports of success in the education and literacy of women, the largest demographic group in the illiterate segment of Soviet society, were used as propaganda in reports by the Soviet State as symbols of the State's power to improve the lot of even the most vulnerable and needy of its society.\n\nWith the October 1917 Revolution, governmental standards regarding what was considered \"literate\" also changed. Although all army personnel in the tsarist period eligible for conscription were required to be functionally literate, most men who could simply read the alphabet and their own name were deemed as fully literate. Although census takers were given rather strict orders on what was deemed fully literate and even semi-literate, in remote provinces and parts of Central Asia standards were somewhat laxer than in locations with a closer proximity to Moscow. The campaign was not the success the Bolsheviks had originally envisioned mainly because it lacked teacher volunteers, funding, and organization.\nThe likbez campaign was most effective for people between the ages of 9 and 35. For anyone over 35, the Bolsheviks believed they were utterly unreachable.\n\nIn 1926, however, only 51% of the population over the age of 10 had achieved literacy. Male literacy was at 66.5 while female literacy lagged behind at 37.2. By 1939, however, male literacy was at 90.8 and female literacy had increased to 72.5%. According to the 1939 Soviet Census, literate people were 89.7% (RSFSR, ages 9–49). During the 1950s, the Soviet Union had become a country of nearly 100% literacy.\n\nThere is speculation that had the peasant tradition of self-education been able to continue, the peasantry may have reached the level of education that it did by the mid-1930s, independent of government efforts. By the 1950s, with a stable education system and an entire generation that had at least completed some form of lower level education, the Soviet Union had reached a literacy rate of 100%.\n\nIn non-Russian speaking areas of the Soviet population, Narkompros promoted the policy of Korenizatsiya (literally \"putting down the roots\") within the separate autonomous regions and republics to the extent that teaching Russian was considered a counter-revolutionary crime. For the separate nationalities, the ABCD Hierarchy, a system which ranked the 120 languages of the Soviet Union according their communicable significance, charted out a specific plan for each nationality's achievement of literacy. In 1924 textbooks were printed in only 25 languages of the Soviet Union. However, by 1934 they were printed in 104 languages.\n\nSources\n"}

Akhundzade singlehandedly opened a new stage of development of Azerbaijani literature. He was also the founder of materialism and atheism movement in Azerbaijan and one of forerunners of modern Iranian nationalism.\n\nAkhundzade was born in 1812 in Nukha (present-day Shaki, Azerbaijan) to a wealthy land owning family from Iranian Azerbaijan. His parents, and especially his uncle Haji Alaskar, who was Fatali's first teacher, prepared young Fatali for a career in Shi'a clergy, but the young man was attracted to the literature. In 1832, while in Ganja, Akhundzade came into contact with the poet Mirza Shafi Vazeh, who introduced him to a Western secular thought and discouraged him from pursuing a religious career. Later in 1834 Akhundzade moved to Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi, Georgia), and spent the rest of his life working as a translator of Oriental languages in the service of the Russian Empire's Viceroyalty. Concurrently, from 1837 onwards he worked as a teacher in Tbilisi uezd Armenian school, then in Nersisyan school. In Tiflis his acquaintance and friendship with the exiled Russian Decembrists Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, Vladimir Odoyevsky, poet Yakov Polonsky, Armenian writers Khachatur Abovian, Gabriel Sundukyan and others played some part in formation of Akhundzade's Europeanized outlook.\nAkhundzade's first published work was \"The Oriental Poem\" (1837), written to lament the death of the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. But the rise of Akhundzade's literary activity comes in the 1850s. In the first half of the 1850s, Akhundzade wrote six comedies – the first comedies in Azerbaijani literature as well as the first samples of the national dramaturgy. The comedies by Akhundzade are unique in their critical pathos, analysis of the realities in Azerbaijan of the first half of the 19th century. These comedies found numerous responses in the Russian other foreign periodical press. The German \"Magazine of Foreign Literature\" called Akhundzade \"dramatic genius\", \"the Azerbaijani Molière\" 1. Akhundzade's sharp pen was directed against everything that he believed hindered the advance of the Russian Empire, which for Akhundzadeh was a force for modernisation, in spite of the atrocities it committed in its southern advance against Akhundzadeh's own kin. According to Walter Kolarz:\n\nThe greatest Azerbaidzhani poet of the nineteenth century, Mirza Fathali Akhundov (1812-78), who is called the \"Molière of the Orient\", was so completely devoted to the Russian cause that he urged his compatriots to fight Turkey during the Crimean War.\n\nIn 1859 Akhundzade published his short but famous novel \"The Deceived Stars\". In this novel he laid the foundation of Azerbaijani realistic historical prose, giving the models of a new genre in Azerbaijani literature. By his comedies and dramas Akhundzade established realism as the leading trend in Azerbaijani literature.\n\nAccording to Ronald Grigor Suny:\nTurkish nationalism, which developed in part as a reaction to the nationalism of the Christian minorities [of the Ottoman Empire], was, like Armenian nationalism, heavily influenced by thinkers who lived and were educated in the Russian Empire. The Crimean Tatar Ismail Bey Gasprinski and the Azerbaijani writer Mirza Fath Ali Akhundzade inspired Turkish intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nAccording to Tadeusz Swietochowski:\nIn his glorification of the pre-Islamic greatness of Iran, before it was destroyed at the hands of the \"hungry, naked and savage Arabs, \"Akhundzada was one of the forerunners of modern Iranian nationalism, and of its militant manifestations at that. Nor was he devoid of anti-Ottoman sentiments, and in his spirit of the age-long Iranian Ottoman confrontation he ventured into his writing on the victory of Shah Abbas I over the Turks at Baghdad. Akhundzade is counted as one of the founders of modern Iranian literature, and his formative influence is visible in such major Persian-language writers as Malkum Khan, Mirza Agha Khan and Mirza Abd ul-Rahim Talibov Tabrizi. All of them were advocates of reforms in Iran. If Akhundzade had no doubt that his spiritual homeland was Iran, Azerbaijan was the land he grew up and whose language was his native tongue. His lyrical poetry was written in Persian, but his work that carry messages of social importance as written in the language of the people of his native land, azari. With no indication of split-personality, he combined larger Iranian identity with Azerbaijani – he used the term vatan (fatherland) in reference to both.\n\nReza Zia-Ebrahimi too considers Akhundzade as the founding-father of what he calls 'dislocative nationalism' in Iran. According to Zia-Ebrahimi, Akhundzade found inspiration in Orientalist templates to construct a vision of ancient Iran, which offered intellectuals disgruntled with the pace of modernist reform in Iran, a self-serving narrative where all of Iran's shortcomings are blamed on a monolithic and otherized 'other': the Arab. For Zia-Ebrahimi, Akhundzade must be credit with the introduction of ethno-racial ideas, particularly the opposition between the Iranian Aryan and the Arab Semite, into Iran's intellectual debates. Zia-Ebrahimi disputes that Akhundzade had any influence on modernist intellectuals such as Malkum Khan (beyond a common project to reform the Alphabet used to write Persian) or Talibov Tabrizi. His real heir was Kermani, and these two intellectuals' legacy is to be found in the ethnic nationalism of the Pahlavi state, rather than the civic nationalism of the Constitutional movement.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre was named after Akhundzade.\n\nAkhundzade identified himself as belonging to the nation of Iran (mellat-e Irān) and to the Iranian homeland (waṭan). He corresponded with Jālāl-al-Din Mirzā (a minor Qajar prince, son of Bahman Mirza Qajar,1826–70) and admired this latter's epic Nāmeh-ye Khosrovān ('Book of Sovereigns'), which was an attempt to offer the modern reader a biography of Iran's ancient kings, real and mythical, without recourse to any Arabic loanword. The Nāmeh presented the pre-Islamic past as one of grandeur, and the advent of Islam as a radical rupture.\n\nFor Zia-Ebrahimi, Akhundzade is the founder of what he refers to as 'dislocative nationalism'. Zia-Ebrahimi defines dislocative nationalism as\n\n'an operation that takes place in the realm of the imagination, an operation whereby the Iranian nation is dislodged from its empirical reality as a majority-Muslim society situated - broadly - in the \"East\". Iran is presented as an Aryan nation adrift, by accident, as it were, from the rest of its fellow Aryans (read: Europeans).'\n\nDislocative nationalism is thus predicated on more than a total distinction between supposedly Aryan Iranians and Semitic Arabs, as it is suggested that the two races are incompatible and in opposition to each other. These ideas are directly indebted to nineteenth-century racial thought, particularly the Aryan race hypothesis developed by European comparative philologists (a hypothesis that Zia-Ebrahimi discusses at length ). Dislocative nationalism presents the pre-Islamic past as the site of a timeless Iranian essence, dismisses the Islamic period as one of decay, and blames all of Iran's shortcomings in the nineteenth and later twentieth century on Arabs and the adoption of Islam. The advent of Islam is thus ethnicised into an 'Arab invasion' and perceived as a case of racial contamination or miscegenation. According to Zia-Ebrahimi, dislocative nationalism does not, in itself, offer a blueprint for reforming the state beyond calls to eliminate what it arbitrarily defines as the legacy of Arabs: Islam and Arabic loanwords.\n\nMirza Aqa Khan Kermani (1854–96) was one of Akhundzades disciples, and three decades later will endeavour to disseminate Akhundzade's thought while also significantly strengthening its racial content (Zia-Ebrahimi argues that Kermani was the first to retrieve the idea of 'the Aryan race' from European texts and refer to it as such, the modern idea of race here being different to the various cognates of the term 'Ariya' that one finds in ancient sources). Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani also followed Jalāl-al-Din Mirzā in producing a national history of Iran, Āʾine-ye sekandari (The Alexandrian Mirror), extending from the mythological past to the Qajar era, again to contrast a mythified and fantasised pre-Islamic past with a present that falls short of nationalist expectations.\n\nZia-Ebrahimi sees dislocative nationalism as the dominant paradigm of identity in modern Iran, as it became part and parcel of the official ideology of the Pahlavi State (1925–79) and thus disseminated through mass-schooling, propaganda, and the state's symbolic repertoire.\n\nWell ahead of his time, Akhundzade was a keen advocate for alphabet reform, recognizing deficiencies of Perso-Arabic script with regards to Turkic sounds. He began his work regarding alphabet reform in 1850. His first efforts focused on modifying the Perso-Arabic script so that it would more adequately satisfy the phonetic requirements of the Azerbaijani language. First, he insisted that each sound be represented by a separate symbol - no duplications or omissions. The Perso-Arabic script expresses only three vowel sounds, whereas Azeri needs to identify nine vowels. Later, he openly advocated the change from Perso-Arabic to a modified Latin alphabet. The Latin script which was used in Azerbaijan between 1922 and 1939, and the Latin script which is used now, were based on Akhundzade's third version.\n\nBeside of his role in Azerbaijani literature and Iranian nationalism, Akhundzadeh was also known for his harsh criticisms of religions (mainly Islam) and stays as the most iconic Azerbaijani atheist. National Library of Azerbaijan and Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre as well as couple of streets, parks and libraries are also named after Akhundzade in Azerbaijan. A cultural museum in Tbilisi, Georgia that focuses on Georgian-Azerbaijani cultural relations is also named after him.\n\nPunik, town in Armenia was also named in the honour of Akhundzade until very recently. TURKSOY hosted a groundbreaking ceremony to declare 2012 as year of Mirza Fatali Akhundzade.\n\nHe published many works on literary criticism:\n\n"}
{"id": "764733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=764733", "title": "Mizrahi Hebrew", "text": "Mizrahi Hebrew\n\nMizrahi Hebrew, or Eastern Hebrew, refers to any of the pronunciation systems for Biblical Hebrew used liturgically by Mizrahi Jews: Jews from Arab countries or east of them and with a background of Arabic, Persian or other languages of the Middle East and Asia. As such, Mizrahi Hebrew is actually a blanket term for many dialects.\n\nSephardi Hebrew is not considered one of these, even if it has been spoken in the Middle East and North Africa. The Sephardim were expellees from Spain and settled among the Mizrahim, but in countries such as Syria and Morocco, there was a fairly high degree of convergence between the Sephardi and the local pronunciations of Hebrew. Yemenite Hebrew is also considered quite separate, as it has a wholly different system for the pronunciation of vowels.\n\nThe same terms are sometimes used for the pronunciation of Modern Hebrew by Jews of Mizrahi origins. It is generally a compromise between Modern Standard Hebrew and the traditional liturgical pronunciation as described in this article. A common form of such compromise is the use of and for and , respectively, with most or all other sounds pronounced as in Standard Israeli Hebrew.\n\nThe following features are generally found in the pronunciation of Jews from Arabic-speaking countries, and the variations tend to follow the Arabic dialect of the country in question:\n\nThe pronunciation of Mizrahi Jews from non-Arab countries differs in some respects. For example, among Persian Jews, distinctively Arabic sounds such as ح and ط do not occur, and Kamatz gadol is pronounced , like the long \"a\" in Persian.\n\nIn Talmudic times, it was noted that the Galilean (and maybe Syrian) pronunciation of Hebrew and Aramaic differed from those of both Judaea and Babylonia, principally by the loss of distinct sounds for the guttural letters \"he\", \"ḥet\" and \"ʿayin\". That feature is still found in Samaritan Hebrew.\n\nAfter the Arab conquest of Palestine and Mesopotamia, much work was done by the Masoretes in standardising and refining the pronunciation of Biblical Hebrew, under the influence of the Arabic grammarians of the time. That included establishing the pronunciation of the guttural letters by reference to their Arabic equivalents. Three distinct notations for the vowels were devised: the Palestinian, the Babylonian and the Tiberian, the last of which eventually superseded the others.\n\nThe distinctive Babylonian pronunciation of Geonic times is still preserved by Yemenite Jews, but they do not retain the Babylonian notation. In Iraq, it appears to have been superseded by the Palestinian pronunciation (similar to today's Sephardi Hebrew) in or around the 11th century, when the Tiberian notation was adopted: both Saadia Gaon and Jacob Qirqisani report that in their time the Palestinian pronunciation had come to be regarded as standard. Nevertheless, in their reading of unvocalised texts such as the Mishnah, Baghdadi Jews preserve certain peculiarities of the old Babylonian pronunciation, particularly with their choices between \"dagesh\" and \"rafe\" and between silent and vocal \"sheva\".\n\nThe process of assimilation to Arabic went the furthest with the Babylonian Jews. For example, in Classical Arabic and in some spoken dialects including Mesopotamian Arabic, there is no phonemic distinction between \"a\" and \"e\", but a phonetic difference is made by the presence of an adjacent emphatic or guttural consonant. Accordingly, the Babylonian notation does not distinguish between \"patach\" (in other pronunciations ), \"segol\" (in other pronunciations or ) and \"sheva na'\", and the three vowels are still pronounced alike (as ) bu Yemenite Jews. In Levantine Arabic, by contrast, there are distinct \"a\" and \"e\" sounds, and both vowels are distinguished in both the Palestinian and the Tiberian notations.\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Sephardi Jews from Spain in 1492, the exiles took the leading position in most Arab and Ottoman countries, and the local pronunciation of Hebrew assimilated to Sephardi Hebrew in many respects, particularly for pronouncing the vowels. Today's Iraqi Jews distinguish between \"patach\" () and \"segol\" () in the same way as most other Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews. However, distinct sounds for the guttural and emphatic letters and the sound for \"bet rafe\" were retained in many Arab countries, probably under the influence of Arabic.\n\nIraqi Jews, like Yemenite Jews, retain the Classical Arabic sounds of \"waw\" () and \"tav raphe\" (). In other Arab countries, \"tav raphe\" is pronounced , which is equally consistent with the pronunciation of both Sephardi Hebrew and of colloquial Arabic. The pronunciation of \"waw\" as , in countries other than Iraq and Yemen, is more clearly Sephardic in origin.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21704", "title": "Norwegian language", "text": "Norwegian language\n\nNorwegian () is a North Germanic language spoken mainly in Norway, where it is the official language. Along with Swedish and Danish, Norwegian forms a dialect continuum of more or less mutually intelligible local and regional varieties, and some Norwegian and Swedish dialects, in particular, are very close. These Scandinavian languages, together with Faroese and Icelandic as well as some extinct languages, constitute the North Germanic languages. Faroese and Icelandic are hardly mutually intelligible with Norwegian in their spoken form because continental Scandinavian has diverged from them. While the two Germanic languages with the greatest numbers of speakers, English and German, have close similarities with Norwegian, neither is mutually intelligible with it.\n\nThere are two official forms of Norwegian, \"Bokmål\" (literally \"book tongue\") and \"Nynorsk\" (\"new Norwegian\"), each with its own variants. Norwegian is one of the two official languages in Norway. The other is Sami, spoken by some members of the Sami people, mostly in the Northern part of Norway. Norwegian and Sami are not mutually intelligible, as Sami belongs to the Finno-Ugric group of languages. Sami is spoken by less than one percent of people in Norway.\n\nNorwegian is one of the working languages of the Nordic Council. Under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries who speak Norwegian have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs.\n\nLike most of the languages in Europe, the Norwegian language descends from the Proto-Indo-European language spoken about 5500 years ago on the Pontic–Caspian steppe north of the Black Sea. As early Indo-Europeans spread across Europe, they became isolated and new languages evolved. In the northwest of Europe, the West Germanic languages evolved, which would eventually become English, Dutch, German, and the North Germanic languages, of which Norwegian is one.\nProto-Norse is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic during the first centuries AD. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the Elder Futhark inscriptions, the oldest form of the runic alphabets. A number of inscriptions are memorials to the dead, while others are magical in content. The oldest are carved on loose objects, while later ones are chiseled in runestones. They are the oldest written record of any Germanic language.\n\nAround 800 AD, the script was simplified to the Younger Futhark, and inscriptions became more abundant. At the same time, the beginning of the Viking Age led to the spread of Old Norse to Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. Viking colonies also existed in parts of the British Isles, France (Normandy), and Russia. In all of these places except Iceland and the Faroes, Old Norse speakers went extinct or were absorbed into the local population.\n\nAround 1030, Christianity came to Scandinavia, bringing with it an influx of Latin borrowings and the Roman alphabet. These new words were related to church practices and ceremonies, although many other loanwords related to general culture also entered the language.\n\nThe Scandinavian languages at this time are not considered to be separate languages, although there were minor differences among what are customarily called Old Icelandic, Old Norwegian, Old Gutnish, Old Danish, and Old Swedish.\n\nThe economic and political dominance of the Hanseatic League between 1250 and 1450 in the main Scandinavian cities brought large Middle Low German-speaking populations to Norway. The influence of their language on Scandinavian is similar to that of French on English after the Norman conquest.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, dialects began to develop in Scandinavia because the population was rural and little travel occurred. When the Reformation came from Germany, Martin Luther's High German translation of the Bible was quickly translated into Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic. Norway entered a union with Denmark in 1397. Danish was the language of the elite, the church, literature, and the law. When the union with Denmark ended in 1814, the Dano-Norwegian \"koiné\" had become the mother tongue of many Norwegians.\n\nFrom the 1840s, some writers experimented with a Norwegianised Danish by incorporating words that were descriptive of Norwegian scenery and folk life, and adopting a more Norwegian syntax. Knud Knudsen proposed to change spelling and inflection in accordance with the Dano-Norwegian \"koiné\", known as \"cultivated everyday speech.\" A small adjustment in this direction was implemented in the first official reform of the Danish language in Norway in 1862 and more extensively after his death in two official reforms in 1907 and 1917.\n\nMeanwhile, a nationalistic movement strove for the development of a new written Norwegian. Ivar Aasen, a botanist and self-taught linguist, began his work to create a new Norwegian language at the age of 22. He traveled around the country collecting words and examples of grammar from the dialects and comparing the dialects among the different regions. He examined the development of Icelandic, which had largely escaped the influences under which Norwegian had come. He called his work, which was published in several books from 1848 to 1873, Landsmål, meaning \"national language\". The name \"Landsmål\" is sometimes interpreted as \"rural language\" or \"country language\", but this was clearly not Aasen's intended meaning.\n\nThe name of the Danish language in Norway was a topic of hot dispute through the 19th century. Its proponents claimed that it was a language common to Norway and Denmark, and no more Danish than Norwegian. The proponents of Landsmål thought that the Danish character of the language should not be concealed. In 1899, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson proposed the neutral name Riksmål, meaning national language like Landsmål, and this was officially adopted along with the 1907 spelling reform. The name \"Riksmål\" is sometimes interpreted as \"state language\", but this meaning is secondary at best. (Compare to Danish rigsmål from where the name was borrowed.)\n\nAfter the personal union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, both languages were developed further and reached what is now considered their classic forms after a reform in 1917. Riksmål was in 1929 officially renamed \"Bokmål\" (literally \"book language\"), and Landsmål to \"Nynorsk\" (literally \"new Norwegian\"). A proposition to substitute Danish-Norwegian (\"dansk-norsk\") for \"Bokmål\" lost in parliament by a single vote. The name \"Nynorsk\", the linguistic term for modern Norwegian, was chosen to contrast with Danish and emphasis on the historical connection to Old Norwegian. Today, this meaning is often lost, and it is commonly mistaken as a \"new\" Norwegian in contrast to the \"real\" Norwegian Bokmål.\n\nBokmål and Nynorsk were made closer by a reform in 1938. This was a result of a state policy to merge Nynorsk and Bokmål into a single language, to be called \"Samnorsk\". A 1946 poll showed that this policy was supported by 79% of Norwegians at the time. However, opponents of the official policy still managed to create a massive protest movement against \"Samnorsk\" in the 1950s, fighting in particular the use of \"radical\" forms in Bokmål text books in schools. In the reform in 1959, the 1938 reform was partially reversed in Bokmål, but Nynorsk was changed further towards Bokmål. Since then Bokmål has reverted even further toward traditional Riksmål, while Nynorsk still adheres to the 1959 standard. Therefore, a small minority of Nynorsk enthusiasts use a more conservative standard called Høgnorsk. The Samnorsk policy had little influence after 1960, and was officially abandoned in 2002.\n\nWhile the sound systems of Norwegian and Swedish are similar, considerable variation exists among the dialects.\n\nThe retroflex consonants only appear in East Norwegian dialects as a result of sandhi, combining with , , , , and .\n\nThe realization of the rhotic depends on the dialect. In Eastern, Central, and Northern Norwegian dialects, it is a tap , whereas in Western and Southern Norway, and for some speakers also in Eastern Norway, it is rendered more gutturally as or . And in the dialects of North-Western Norway, it is realized as , much like the trilled R of Spanish.\n\nNorwegian is a pitch-accent language with two distinct pitch patterns, like Swedish. They are used to differentiate two-syllable words with otherwise identical pronunciation. For example, in many East Norwegian dialects, the word \" (farmers) is pronounced using tone 1, while \" (beans or prayers) uses tone 2. Though spelling differences occasionally differentiate written words, in most cases the minimal pairs are written alike, since written Norwegian has no explicit accent marks. In most eastern low-tone dialects, accent 1 uses a low flat pitch in the first syllable, while accent 2 uses a high, sharply falling pitch in the first syllable and a low pitch in the beginning of the second syllable. In both accents, these pitch movements are followed by a rise of intonational nature (phrase accent)—the size (and presence) of which signals emphasis or focus, and corresponds in function to the normal accent in languages that lack lexical tone, such as English. That rise culminates in the final syllable of an accentual phrase, while the utterance-final fall common in most languages is either very small or absent.\n\nThere are significant variations in pitch accent between dialects. Thus, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary. The pitch accents (as well as the peculiar phrase accent in the low-tone dialects) give the Norwegian language a \"singing\" quality that makes it easy to distinguish from other languages. Accent 1 generally occurs in words that were monosyllabic in Old Norse, and accent 2 in words that were polysyllabic.\n\nThe Norwegian alphabet has 29 letters.\nThe letters \"c\", \"q\", \"w\", \"x\" and \"z\" are only used in loanwords. As loanwords are assimilated into Norwegian, their spelling might change to reflect Norwegian pronunciation and the principles of Norwegian orthography, e.g. \"zebra\" in Norwegian is written \"sebra\". Due to historical reasons, some otherwise Norwegian family names are also written using these letters.\n\nSome letters may be modified by diacritics: \"é\", \"è\", \"ê\", \"ó\", \"ò\", and \"ô\". In Nynorsk, \"ì\" and \"ù\" and \"ỳ\" are occasionally seen as well. The diacritics are not compulsory, but may in a few cases distinguish between different meanings of the word, e.g.: for (for/to), fór (went), fòr (furrow) and fôr (fodder). Loanwords may be spelled with other diacritics, most notably \"ü\", \"á\" and \"à\".\n\nAs established by law and government policy, the two official forms of \"written\" Norwegian are \"Bokmål\" (literally \"book tongue\") and \"Nynorsk\" (\"new Norwegian\"). The official Norwegian Language Council (\"Språkrådet\") is responsible for regulating the two forms, and recommends the terms \"Norwegian Bokmål\" and \"Norwegian Nynorsk\" in English. Two other written forms without official status also exist, one, called \"Riksmål\" (\"national language\"), is today to a large extent the same language as Bokmål though somewhat closer to the Danish language. It is regulated by the unofficial Norwegian Academy, which translates the name as \"Standard Norwegian\". The other is \"Høgnorsk\" (\"High Norwegian\"), a more purist form of Nynorsk, which maintains the language in an original form as given by Ivar Aasen and rejects most of the reforms from the 20th century; this form has limited use.\n\nNynorsk and Bokmål provide standards for how to write Norwegian, but not for how to speak the language. No standard of spoken Norwegian is officially sanctioned, and most Norwegians speak their own dialects in all circumstances. Thus, unlike in many other countries, the use of any Norwegian dialect, whether it coincides with the written norms or not, is accepted as correct \"spoken\" Norwegian. However, in areas where East Norwegian dialects are used, a tendency exists to accept a \"de facto\" spoken standard for this particular regional dialect, \"Urban East Norwegian\" or \"Standard East Norwegian\" (), in which the vocabulary coincides with Bokmål. Outside Eastern Norway, this spoken variation is not used.\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, Danish was the standard written language of Norway. As a result, the development of modern written Norwegian has been subject to strong controversy related to nationalism, rural versus urban discourse, and Norway's literary history. Historically, Bokmål is a Norwegianised variety of Danish, while Nynorsk is a language form based on Norwegian dialects and puristic opposition to Danish. The now-abandoned official policy to merge Bokmål and Nynorsk into one common language called \"Samnorsk\" through a series of spelling reforms has created a wide spectrum of varieties of both Bokmål and Nynorsk. The unofficial form known as \"Riksmål\" is considered more conservative than Bokmål and is far closer to Danish while the unofficial \"Høgnorsk\" is more conservative than Nynorsk and is far closer to Faroese, Icelandic and Old Norse.\n\nNorwegians are educated in both Bokmål and Nynorsk. The language form that is not registered as the main language form of a Norwegian student will be a mandatory school subject in both high school and elementary school for the student, which is called Sidemål. For instance, a Norwegian with Bokmål as its main language form has Nynorsk as a mandatory school subject throughout both high school and elementary school. A 2005 poll indicates that 86.3% use primarily Bokmål as their daily written language, 5.5% use both Bokmål and Nynorsk, and 7.5% use primarily Nynorsk. Thus, 13% are frequently \"writing\" Nynorsk, though the majority \"speak\" dialects that resemble Nynorsk more closely than Bokmål. Broadly speaking, Nynorsk writing is widespread in western Norway, though not in major urban areas, and also in the upper parts of mountain valleys in the southern and eastern parts of Norway. Examples are Setesdal, the western part of Telemark county (\"fylke\") and several municipalities in Hallingdal, Valdres, and Gudbrandsdalen. It is little used elsewhere, but 30–40 years ago, it also had strongholds in many rural parts of Trøndelag (mid-Norway) and the southern part of northern Norway (Nordland county). Today, not only is Nynorsk the official language of four of the 19 Norwegian counties, but also of many municipalities in five other counties. NRK, the Norwegian broadcasting corporation, broadcasts in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, and all governmental agencies are required to support both written languages. Bokmål is used in 92% of all written publications, and Nynorsk in 8% (2000).\n\nLike some other European countries, Norway has an official \"advisory board\" Språkrådet (Norwegian Language Council) that determines, after approval from the Ministry of Culture, official spelling, grammar, and vocabulary for the Norwegian language. The board's work has been subject to considerable controversy throughout the years.\n\nBoth Nynorsk and Bokmål have a great variety of optional forms. The Bokmål that uses the forms that are close to Riksmål is called \"moderate\" or \"conservative\", depending on one's viewpoint, while the Bokmål that uses the forms that are close to Nynorsk is called \"radical\". Nynorsk has forms that are close to the original Landsmål and forms that are close to Bokmål.\n\nOpponents of the spelling reforms aimed at bringing Bokmål closer to Nynorsk have retained the name Riksmål and employ spelling and grammar that predate the Samnorsk movement. Riksmål and conservative versions of Bokmål have been the \"de facto\" standard written language of Norway for most of the 20th century, being used by large newspapers, encyclopedias, and a significant proportion of the population of the capital Oslo, surrounding areas, and other urban areas, as well as much of the literary tradition. Since the reforms of 1981 and 2003 (effective in 2005), the official Bokmål can be adapted to be almost identical with modern Riksmål. The differences between written Riksmål and Bokmål are comparable to American and British English differences.\n\nRiksmål is regulated by the Norwegian Academy, which determines acceptable spelling, grammar, and vocabulary.\n\nThere is also an unofficial form of Nynorsk, called \"Høgnorsk\", discarding the post-1917 reforms, and thus close to Ivar Aasen's original Landsmål. It is supported by Ivar Aasen-sambandet, but has found no widespread use.\n\nIn 2010 86.5% of the pupils in the primary and lower secondary schools in Norway receive education in Bokmål, while 13.0% receive education in Nynorsk. From the eighth grade onwards pupils are required to learn both. Out of the 431 municipalities in Norway, 161 have declared that they wish to communicate with the central authorities in Bokmål, 116 (representing 12% of the population) in Nynorsk, while 156 are neutral. Of 4,549 state publications in 2000 8% were in Nynorsk, and 92% in Bokmål. The large national newspapers (Aftenposten, Dagbladet, and VG) are published in Bokmål or Riksmål. Some major regional newspapers (including \"Bergens Tidende\" and \"Stavanger Aftenblad\"), many political journals, and many local newspapers use both Bokmål and Nynorsk.\n\nA newer trend is to write in dialect for informal use. When writing an SMS, Facebook update, or fridge note, most younger people write the way they talk rather than using Bokmål or Nynorsk.\n\nThere is general agreement that a wide range of differences makes it difficult to estimate the number of different Norwegian dialects. Variations in grammar, syntax, vocabulary, and pronunciation cut across geographical boundaries and can create a distinct dialect at the level of farm clusters. Dialects are in some cases so dissimilar as to be unintelligible to unfamiliar listeners. Many linguists note a trend toward regionalization of dialects that diminishes the differences at such local levels; there is, however, a renewed interest in preserving distinct dialects.\n\nBelow are a few sentences giving an indication of the differences between Bokmål and Nynorsk, compared to the conservative (closer to Danish) form Riksmål, Danish, as well as Old Norse, Swedish, Faroese, Icelandic (the living language grammatically closest to Old Norse), Old English and some modern West Germanic languages:\n\nNorwegian nouns are inflected for number (singular/plural) and declined for definiteness (indefinite/definite) and case (nominative/genitive). In some dialects, definite nouns are also in the dative.\n\nNorwegian nouns belong to three noun classes: masculine, feminine and neuter. Adjectives and determiners agree in gender with the noun they modifiy. Riksmål and conservative Bokmål traditionally have two genders like Danish, but Nynorsk and most speakers of Norwegian regional dialects use three genders to different extents.\n\nThe inflection of feminine words like \"jente\" using morphemes from the masculine noun class is common in the Bergen and Oslo areas. However, feminine noun class morphology tends to be restricted in most Eastern and Northern dialects to the uses of the definite article.\n\nIn general, almost all nouns in Bokmål follow these patterns (like the words in the examples above):\nIn contrast, almost all nouns in Nynorsk follow these patterns (the noun gender system is more pronounced than in Bokmål):\nUnlike in Bokmål, in Nynorsk feminine nouns cannot be inflected using masculine noun class morphology. Feminine nouns must be written using the prescribed inflection patterns.\n\nThere is no way in general to infer what gender a specific noun has, but there some patterns of nouns where the gender can be inferred. For instance, all nouns ending in -\"nad\" will be masculine in both Bokmål and Nynorsk (for instance the noun \"jobbsøknad\", which means job application). Most nouns ending in -\"ing\" will be feminine, like the noun \"forventning\" (expectation).\n\nThere are some common irregular nouns, many of which are irregular in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, like the following:\n\nIn Nynorsk, even though the irregular word \"fot\" is masculine, it is inflected like a feminine word in the plural. Another word with the same irregular inflection is \"son - søner\" (son - sons).\n\nIn Nynorsk, nouns ending in -\"ing\" typically have masculine plural inflections, like the word \"dronning\" in the following table. But they are treated as feminine nouns in every other way.\nIn general, the genitive case has died out in modern Norwegian and there are only some remnants of it in certain expressions: \"til fjells\" (to the mountains), \"til sjøs\" (to the sea). To show ownership, there is an enclitic -\"s\" similar to English -\"s\"; \"Sondres flotte bil\" (Sondre's nice car, Sondre being a personal name). There are also reflexive possessive pronouns, \"sin\", \"si\", \"sitt\", \"sine\"; \"Det er Sondre sitt\" (It is Sondre's). In both Bokmål and modern Nynorsk, there is often a mix of both of these to mark possession, though it is more common in Nynorsk to use the reflexive pronouns; in Nynorsk use of the reflexive possessive pronouns is generally encouraged to avoid mixing the enclitic -\"s\" with the historical grammatical case remnants of the language. The reflexive pronouns agree in gender and number with the noun.\n\nThe enclitic -\"s\" in Norwegian evolved as a shorthand expression for the possessive pronouns \"sin\", \"si\", \"sitt\" and \"sine\". \n\nNorwegian adjectives inflect for gender, number, definiteness and for comparison (positive/comparative/superlative). Most adjectives in all Norwegian dialects and written forms follow the pattern below. \n\nIn most dialects, some verb participles used as adjectives have a separate form in both definite and plural uses, and sometimes also in the masculine-feminine singular:\n\n\nIn some Southwestern dialects, the definite adjective is also declined in gender and number with one form for feminine and plural, and one form for masculine and neuter.\n\nIn Norwegian, a definite noun has a suffixed article (cf. above). However, when a definitive noun is preceded by an adjective (or a numeral), an additional definite article is placed in front of the adjective in the beginning of the noun phrase, so that definiteness is marked twice since the adjective is inflected as definite as well. In Bokmål, though, the suffixed noun article may be dropped in formal or literary styles.\n\nDefiniteness is also signaled by using possessive pronouns or any uses of a noun in its genitive form in either Nynorsk or Bokmål: \"mitt grønne hus\" (\"my green house\"), \"min grønne bil\" (\"my green car\"), \"mitt tilbaketrukne tannkjøtt\" (\"my pulled gums\"), \"presidentens gamle hus\" (\"the president's old house\").\n\nExamples of comparative and superlative inflections in Bokmål: \"et hvitere hus\" (a whiter house), \"den grønneste bilen\" (the greenest car); \"hvitere hus\" (whiter house), \"grønnest bil\" (greenest car).\nIn all dialects of Norwegian and in the written languages, unlike related languages like German, there is also predicative agreement of adjectives.\n\nThis means that nouns will have to agree with the adjective when there is a copula verb involved, like in Bokmål: «være» (to be), «bli» (become), «ser ut» (looks like), «kjennes» (feels like) etc. \n\nNorwegian finite verbs are inflected or conjugated according to mood: indicative/imperative/subjunctive. The subjunctive mood is constrained to only a handful of verbs. Indicative verbs are conjugated for tense: present / past / future. The infinitive, present and past tense also have a passive form. In a few dialects, indicative verbs are also conjugated according to number. Agreement with person is lost in Norwegian.\n\nThere are four non-finite verb forms: infinitive, passive infinitive, and the two participles perfective/past participle and imperfective/present participle.\n\nThe participles are verbal adjectives. The imperfective participle is not declined, whereas the perfect participle is declined for gender (though not in Bokmål) and number like strong, positive adjectives. The definite form of the participle is identical to the plural form.\n\nAs with other Germanic languages, Norwegian verbs can be either weak or strong.\n\nThere are ergative verbs in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, where there is two different conjugation patterns depending on if the verb takes an object or not. In Bokmål, there are only two different conjugations for the preterite tense for the strong verbs, while Nynorsk has different conjugations for all tenses, like Swedish and a majority of Norwegian dialects. Some weak verbs are also ergative and are differentiated for all tenses in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, like «ligge»/«legge» that both means to lie down, but «ligge» does not take an object while «legge» requires an object. «legge» corresponds to the English verb «lay», while «ligge» corresponds to the English verb «lie». There are however many verbs that do not have this direct translation to English verbs.\n\nNorwegian personal pronouns are declined according to case: nominative / accusative. Like English, pronouns in Bokmål and Nynorsk are the only class that has case declension. Some of the dialects that have preserved the dative in nouns, also have a dative case instead of the accusative case in personal pronouns, while others have accusative in pronouns and dative in nouns, effectively giving these dialects three distinct cases.\n\nIn the most comprehensive Norwegian grammar, Norsk referansegrammatikk, the categorization of personal pronouns by person, gender, and number is not regarded as inflection. Pronouns are a closed class.\n\nThe words for «mine», «yours» etc. are dependent on the gender of the noun it describes. Just like adjectives, they have to agree in gender with the noun.\n\nBokmål has two sets of 3rd person pronouns. \"Han\" and \"hun\" refer to male and female individuals respectively, \"den\" and \"det\" refer to impersonal or inanimate nouns, of masculine/feminine or neutral gender respectively. In contrast, Nynorsk and most dialects use the same set of pronouns \"han\" (he), \"ho\" (she) and \"det\" (it) for both personal and impersonal references, just like in German. \"Det\" also has expletive and cataphoric uses like in the English examples it rains\" and it was known by everyone (that) he had travelled the world\".\nUnlike Swedish and Danish, the ordering of possessive pronouns are a bit more free. When there is no adjective, the most common word order is the one used in the examples in the table above, where the possessive comes after the noun, while the noun is in its definite form; «boka mi» (my book). If one wishes to emphasize the owner of the noun, the possessive pronoun usually come first. In Bokmål however, due to its Danish origins, one could choose to always write the possessive first «min bil» (my car), but this may sound very formal. Some dialects that have been very influenced by Danish do this too, some speakers in Bærum and the west of Oslo may always use this word order. When there is an adjective describing the noun, the possessive pronoun will always come first; «min egen bil» (my own car).\n\nThe closed class of Norwegian determiners are declined in gender and number in agreement with their argument. Not all determiners are inflected.\n\nNorwegian has five closed classes without inflection, i.e. lexical categories with grammatical function and a finite number of members that may not be distinguished by morphological criteria. These are interjections, conjunctions, subjunctions, prepositions, and adverbs. The inclusion of adverbs here requires that traditional adverbs that are inflected in comparison be classified as adjectives, as is sometimes done.\n\nIn Norwegian compound words, the head, i.e. the part determining the compound's class, is the last part. If the compound word is constructed from many different nouns, the last noun in the compound noun will determine the gender of the compound noun. Only the first part has primary stress. For instance, the compound \"tenketank\" (think tank) has primary stress on the first syllable and is a masculine noun since the noun «tank» is masculine.\n\nCompound words are written together in Norwegian, which can cause words to become very long, for example ' (maximum likelihood estimator) and ' (human rights organizations). Other examples are the title \"høyesterettsjustitiarius\" (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, originally a combination of supreme court and the actual title, justiciar) and the translation \"En midtsommernattsdrøm\" for \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\n\nIf they are not written together, each part is naturally read with primary stress, and the meaning of the compound is lost. Examples of this in English are the difference between a green house and a greenhouse or a black board and a blackboard.\n\nThis is sometimes forgotten, occasionally with humorous results. Instead of writing, for example, ' (lamb chops), people make the mistake of writing ' (lame, or paralyzed, chops). The original message can even be reversed, as when ' (lit. \"smoke-free\" meaning no smoking) becomes ' (smoke freely).\n\nOther examples include:\nThese misunderstandings occur because most nouns can be interpreted as verbs or other types of words.\nSimilar misunderstandings can be achieved in English too. The following are examples of phrases that both in Norwegian and English mean one thing as a compound word, and something different when regarded as separate words:\n\nNorwegian syntax is predominantly SVO with the subject of the sentence coming first, then the verb coming second and finally the object. However, like many other Germanic languages such as Dutch, it has a V2 rule, which means that the finite verb will be placed as the second element within a sentence. No matter what, the finite/conjugated verb will always be the second element of a sentence. E.g.:\n\n•\"Jeg spiser fisk \"i dag\" (I eat fish \"today\")\n\n•\"I dag\" spiser jeg fisk\" (\"Today\", I eat fish)\n\n•\"Jeg vil drikke kaffe \"i dag\" (I want to drink coffee \"today\")\n\n•\"I dag\" vil jeg drikke kaffe\" (\"Today\", I want to drink coffee)\n\nAny piece of the sentence could be placed first to highlight its importance, but the finite verb must \"always\" follow its subject.\n\nAdjectives always precede the noun that they modify.\n\nBy far the largest part of the modern vocabulary of Norwegian dates back to Old Norse. The largest source of loanwords is Middle Low German, which had a huge influence on Norwegian vocabulary from the late Middle Ages onwards partially even influencing grammatical structures, such as genitive constructions. Bokmål and many dialects have these loanwords, while Nynorsk is more puristic and has many of these words replaced with words that are derived from Old Norse, Nynorsk thus shares more vocabulary with Icelandic and Faroese. There are Middle Low German vocabulary in Nynorsk too, but to a lesser extent than Bokmål. At present, the main source of new loanwords is English e.g. \"rapper\", \"e-mail\", \"catering\", \"juice\", \"bag\" (originally a loan word to English from Old Norse).\n\nSome loanwords have their spelling changed to reflect Norwegian pronunciation rules, but in general Norwegianised spellings of these words tend to take a long time to sink in: e.g. ' (from French ') and ' (from French ') are now the common Norwegian spellings, but \"juice\" is more often used than the Norwegianised form ', \"catering\" more often than ', \"service\" more often than \"\", etc.\n\nNorwegian has also and continues to borrow words and phrases from both Danish and Swedish to a relatively large extent. And though there are very often related, similar- or identical-sounding words in those languages, the spelling in Norwegian is often less conservative and, arguably, closer to the pronunciation, and thus different from the others, and four of the letters most shunned in Norwegian in comparison to the other Scandinavian languages are \"c\", \"d\", \"j\" and \"x\". Norwegian ' is ' in Swedish and Danish; the words \"sex\" and \"six\" are ' and ' in Norwegian, but in Swedish they are both '; Danish words ending in ' end in ' to reflect pronunciation and many traditional Danish spellings with \"d\" preceded by another consonant are changed to double consonants, such as in the Danish for water, ', versus Norwegian (Bokmål) spelling ', but \"sand\" is spelled ' in both languages (Norwegian was standardized this way because in some dialects a \"d\" was pronounced in ', whereas Norwegian speakers pronounced ' without a \"d\"-sound). (The word for water in Nynorsk is \"\".)\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "776459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=776459", "title": "Pas de deux", "text": "Pas de deux\n\nIn ballet, a pas de deux (French, literally \"step of two\") is a dance duet in which two dancers, typically a male and a female, perform ballet steps together. The pas de deux is characteristic of classical ballet and can be found in many well-known ballets, including \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Swan Lake\", and \"Giselle\". It is most often performed by a male and a female (a \"danseur\" and a \"ballerina\") though there are exceptions, such as in the film \"White Nights\", in which a pas de deux is performed by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines.\n\nA grand pas de deux is a structured pas de deux that typically has five parts, consisting of an \"entrée\" (introduction), an \"adagio\", two variations (a solo for each dancer), and a \"coda\" (conclusion). It is effectively a suite of dances that share a common theme, often symbolic of a love story or the partnership inherent in love, with the dancers portraying expressions of affectionate feelings and thoughts between romantic partners. It is often considered to be the pièce de résistance and bravura highlight of a ballet and is usually performed by a leading pair of principal dancers.\n\nA grand pas de deux usually begins with an entrée (literally \"entrance\"), which serves as a short prelude to and also unequivocally denotes the beginning of the dance suite. During the entrée, the dancers first appear on the stage and, typically with great pageantry, acknowledge each other and position themselves near each other in preparation for the subsequent adagio. Depending on the choreography, the ballerina and danseur may enter the stage simultaneously or at different times.\n\nThe \"adagio\" or \"adage\" (meaning \"slowly\") part of a grand pas de deux features graceful and elaborate partnering by the dancing pair. In the adagio, the ballerina performs elegant, often slow and sustained movements while the danseur supports her. The danseur, in turn, strives to maintain a display of poise and seemingly effortless strength while providing support for the ballerina. The danseur may support the ballerina in a variety of common ways, including lifting her, holding and steadying her during turns, and offering a steady arm or hand for her to use as a \"virtual barre\" when she performs balancing feats that would be difficult or impossible without assistance. Because of this support the adagio is sometimes called \"supported adagio\". \nUpon completion of the adagio, the dancers separate and each dancer, in turn, takes center stage and performs a \"variation\" (a solo dance). In general, the variations are intended to showcase spectacular, acrobatic leaps and turns, as well as the skills and athleticism of the individual dancers. The danseur's variation is usually performed first, followed by the ballerina's variation.\n\nThe \"coda\" (literally \"tail\") is the concluding segment of a grand pas de deux. Typically, it is a recapitulation of earlier segments of the grand pas de deux, consisting of elements that are characteristic of the adagio, variations, or both, and ends during a grand musical climax.\n\nElements of the grand pas de deux first appeared in the early 18th century as opening acts of operas and ballets in which a couple would perform identical dance steps, sometimes while holding hands. At that time and throughout the Baroque period, ballet partner dancing was evolving to show more dramatic content. For example, in \"The Loves of Mars and Venus\" ballet of 1717, Mars (the male dancer) strove to portray gallantry, respect, ardent love and adoration, while Venus showed bashfulness, reciprocal love, and wishful looks.\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries a romantic pas de deux emerged that involved closer physical contact, with ballerinas dancing on their toes in the hands of their partners. As the 19th century progressed, the form became a showcase for the skills of the increasingly sophisticated ballerina.\n\nThe ballets of the late 19th Century—particularly of those of Marius Petipa—introduced the concept of the grand pas de deux, which often served as the climax of a scene or an entire performance. This involved a consistent format of entrée and adagio by a pair of leading male and female dancers, followed by virtuosic solos (first by the male and then the female) and a finale. During the 20th century, the grand pas de deux became more integrated with the story of the ballet, with increasingly acrobatic content.\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to transitioning, he identified as a lesbian and as such, wrote for many years a sex advice column for the gay men's leather magazine \"Drummer\". His writings explore sexuality and gender identity, and have included lesbian erotica and works about BDSM subculture. Califia is a member of the third-wave feminism movement.\n\nCalifia was born in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1954 and grew up in Utah in a Mormon family. His father was a construction worker and his mother was a housewife. Califia was the oldest of six children. Califia has said he did not have a good childhood, claimed that his father was an angry and violent man and his mother a pious woman.\n\nCalifia believed in the Mormon religion, and there were elements of Mormonism in his approach to life. One primary tenet of Mormonism Califia tended to follow was, \"if the truth has been revealed to you and you don't speak out, you are culpable for any wrongs that are committed in those realms of life.\" Califia's sense of difference began when he was a child. He had dreams of becoming a train engineer which his parents shot down because he was born female. He started transitioning in 1999.\n\nIn the 1970s, Califia's parents had him admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and he dropped out of college (the University of Utah in Salt Lake City) due to his mental state. Califia came out as lesbian in 1971 while attending college. He began using the last name \"Califia,\" after the mythical female warrior Amazon. Califia began to evade his parents, and became involved in the women's liberation and anti-war movements. After getting involved in consciousness raising in the area, he moved to San Francisco in 1973, bringing an interest in sex education to work on the San Francisco Sex Information switchboard. After moving to San Francisco he began writing for a magazine and joined a lesbian separatist movement. In 1975 he spoke in favor of sadomasochism and found himself excluded from the lesbian feminist community. He was not only excluded from his nuclear family by coming out as a lesbian but also lost his gay family when speaking his opinions. Califia became increasingly involved in S/M activities not only with lesbians but also with gay men. He co-founded the first lesbian S/M group, Samois, in 1978.\n\nCalifia began attending the University of Utah in Salt Lake City in 1971. In 1981, he graduated from San Francisco State University (SFSU) with a bachelor of arts degree in psychology. He has also said he has a master's degree.\n\nIn 1980, Califia published his first book—\"Sapphistry: The Book of Lesbian Sexuality\", a non-fiction work for lesbians which described, in a non-judgmental tone, butch-femme sexuality, and BDSM safety and practice. Subsequently, he published work in lesbian, gay and feminist magazines, including a long-running sex advice column in \"The Advocate\".\n\nCalifia is \"one of earliest champions of lesbian sadomasochistic sex\" whose \"work has been taught on college campuses across the country and abroad.\" He has a long history of transgression, identifying as a feminist, lesbian, and transgender while also at times finding rejection from those communities \"for various infractions.\" He played what some observers termed a \"notable role\" in the Feminist Sex Wars of the 1970s/1980s. The sides were characterized by anti-porn feminist and sex-positive feminist groups with disagreements regarding sexuality, pornography and other forms of sexual representation, prostitution, the role of trans women in the lesbian community, lesbian sexual practices, sadomasochism, and other sexual issues. Califia rejected the \"essentialist, feminist ideology – that women are better, more nurturing, more peaceful, more loving, more relationship-oriented and less raunchy in bed,\" instead advocating for BDSM, \"the consensual integration of power, pain, domination and submission into sex.\" According to the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", many feminists were won over to Califia's views on S/M not from his arguments, but from his erotic fiction: \"they read Califia-Rice's S/M fantasies, got turned on and got over it.\"\n\nIn 1979, as a student in psychology at San Francisco State University, his research was published in the \"Journal of Homosexuality\".\n\nCalifia co-founded Samois, a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization based in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983, and shifted his focus to the lesbian experience of BDSM. The Samois Collective produced, with Califia's contributions, the book, \"Coming to Power\", published by Alyson Publications. \"Coming To Power\", according to editor in chief Heather Findlay of lesbian magazine \"Girlfriends\", was \"one of the most transformative lesbian books, [foretelling] the end of a certain puritanism that had dominated the community. It was the first articulate defense of lesbian S/M, and that was the end of it.\" Another book, the \"Lesbian S/M Safety Manual\", won the 1990 Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year.\n\nIn 1992 Califia founded the leatherwomen's quarterly \"Venus Infers\", and published \"Feminism, Paedophilia, and Children's Rights\" in Vol. 2, No. 4, a special women's issue, of the pro-pedophile scholarly journal \"Paidika\". In 1996 he was co-editor, with Robin Sweeney, of \"The Second Coming: A Leatherdyke Reader\", a sequel to \"Coming to Power\". Califia was writing about queer studies and gender identity, and coming to terms with these issues on a personal level. At age 45, Califia transitioned, taking the name Patrick.\n\nIn a 2000 interview, Califia explained that the inspiration for his erotic writings varies; sometimes it is just about having fun, or it can be satire, or exploring a sexuality issue like HIV-positive people barebacking with the intention of infecting the other person with the virus. In the interview with Rona Marech, Califia is quoted as saying:\nIt's about me trying to put a human face on that and understand that from the inside out. ...It's about being thought-provoking, hopefully. And I like (presenting issues) that challenge the reader; that are maybe a little scary, maybe hard to think about. ...It's also a way to top a lot of people. In some ways, I get to do a scene with everyone who reads one [sic] my books.\nJanet Hardy, of Greenery Press, admires Califia's tenacity, stating, \"He's got a phenomenal mind. ...He's willing to get a hold of a thought and follow it through to the end, even if it doesn't feel comfortable.\"\n\nCalifia was nominated for the Lambda Literary Awards for his short-story collection, \"Macho Sluts\" (1988), his novel, \"Doc and Fluff: The Dystopian Tale of a Girl and Her Biker\" (1990), and a compilation of his columns, \"The Advocate Adviser\" (1991). He is working on a book that discusses the topic of FTM sexuality, and is working on a new set of essays surrounding the topic of BDSM. He has also written vampire books.\n\nCalifia presented a paper for the American Academy of Religion conference in Montréal, November 19–22, 2009, on the gay marriage debate, and how arguments about monogamy and S/M have been used to try and control the argument.\n\nWhen Califia would travel to Canada, his pornographic works were often seized by Canadian customs, until he fought a court case to allow them to be accepted. Afterwards, he wrote of his amusement at finding that anti-porn feminist Catherine Itzin's book, \"Pornography: Women, Violence and Civil Liberties\", was seized under the very law she had helped to establish, while Califia's books were recognized as acceptable by that law. Califia fought against anti-pornography legislation co-authored by Catharine MacKinnon.\n\nIn 2013, he was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the LGBT History Month.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2011, Califia was licensed in California as a marriage and family therapist (MFT).\n\nCalifia has a son, Blake Califia-Rice (born October 1999), to whom his ex-partner, Matt Rice (now a trans man), gave birth.\n\nCalifia has said that since the 1990s, he has had fibromyalgia.\n\nIn 1999, Califia decided to begin hormone replacement therapy as a part of his transition. Califia had considered sex reassignment in his twenties, but had been hesitant, for one reason, because there were many dangers to the surgery at that time. He also hesitated because his career had been built around a reputation as a lesbian writer and activist. Califia had entered age-related perimenopause when he began his transition. He has stated that being a man or a woman was never a good fit for him but sex reassignment seemed to be the most reasonable option.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Drawing from sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology, raciolinguistics focuses on race and its relation to language. A central concern of raciolinguistics is to understand the complex meanings and implications of speech coming from a racialized subject. The field also explores how the relationship between race and language impacts domains like politics and education.\n\nAlthough sociolinguists and linguistic anthropologists have previously studied the intersections of language, race, and culture, raciolinguistics is a relatively new focus for scholars trying to theorize race throughout language studies. Nelson Flores and Jonathan Rosa first popularized the term in their 2015 discussion of \"appropriateness\" in American language and education. In 2016, H. Samy Alim, John R. Rickford and Arnetha F. Ball published a book compiling raciolinguistic research. In their work, raciolinguists incorporate intersectionality in theorizing how various identities (e.g. gender, ethnicity, nationality) within a group and/or an individual influence lived experiences of race.\n\n\"Languaging race\" focuses on how race can be constructed or deconstructed \"through the lens of language\" Through and by language, one can take on, discard, or impose affiliations made with a certain race; such as education level, economic status, etc.\n\n\"Languaging race\" also encompasses the theory of transracialization, made popular in the United States by the case of Rachel Dolezal. However, within raciolinguistics, the emphasis of transracialization is put on how individuals both resist racial categorization and use such categorization in order to achieve racial justice, as in the case of Black Lives Matter.\n\n\"Racing language\" uses race theory to understand how sociolinguistic variation relates to social and political processes. This includes the development of African American Language (AAL) in the United States, the generational linguistic shifts of Punjabi communities in London, and the significance of pharyngeal versus depharyngealized Hebrew in Israel. Association with a racial group may be related to the use of ethnolects or ethnolinguistic repertoires, influencing the language used among a racial group and/or an individual seeking to identify with the group. This area explores the historic and systematic reasons linguistic features are associated with certain racial groups.\n\nIn their critique of American language education, Nelson Flores and Jonathan Rosa argued that the standardization of \"appropriate\" language in American schooling creates different experiences for racialized students. \"Appropriate\" language, defined by the language of the dominant culture, is a construction of raciolinguistic ideologies that uphold certain linguistic practices as normative and others as deficient. These ideologies are defined by the White listening/speaking subject in that \"language-minoritized students [are expected] to mimic the white speaking subject while ignoring the raciolinguistic ideologies that the white listening subject uses to position them as racial Others\".\n\nIn her LangCrit framework, Alison Crump also explored Whiteness within the construction and education of a standard English and how language scholars may further address language, race, and identity in language education.\n\n"}

His father was a senior official with the post office. While he was growing up he attended schools successively in Düsseldorf, Hamburg and Berlin. He successfully completed his schooling in 1909 in Berlin. By this time he was a member of the circle of youthful left wing intellectuals surrounding the poet Henriette Hardenberg and her brother Hans. A period of study in Munich followed and Richard Oehring, along with his brother Fritz joined the informal so-called \"Tat\" (\"Deed[s]\") group of left-leaning politically aware liberal writers and artists: fellow members included Oskar Maria Graf, Franz Jung and Georg Schrimpf. Following his return to Berlin, Richard Oehring took to contributing as a business and economics journalist to the \"Buchwald Börsenberichte\" newspaper. From 1912 he was providing pieces for \"Die Aktion\", a newly launched magazine with its focus on literature and left-wing politics in which he also published some of his poetic and lyrical creations. One of these was his essay \"Der Käfig\" which appeared in 1913/1914. During 1913/1914 he actively promoted \"Die Aktion Authors' Evenings\" at the magazine, together with the likes of Gottfried Benn, Paul Boldt, Alfred Lichtenstein and Franz Pfemfert.\n\nHis brother Fritz was an early victim of the war which broke out in July 1914. Richard Oehring took part in the war, being stationed in Brussels where he undertook medical work. Falling ill, he returned home to Berlin, but was re-assessed and declared fit for military service. He was reconscripted and deserted, eventually achieving his dismissal by refusing to accept either food or wages. In March 1915 he married Cläre Otto, later described by as \"the soul and muse of their little [Berlin based artists' and writers'] circle\". Starting in 1915 they produced \"\" \"(The Free Street)\", an Anarchist-Dadaist journal appearing at irregular intervals and of which, by the end of 1917, six editions had been produced. Other members of the production team were Franz Jung, Otto Gross and Georg Schrimpf. A feature of \"Die freie Straße\" was that the team took turns to take responsibility for production. Richard Oehring was the producer for editions 3 and 4.\n\nOehring's marriage to Cläre Otto ended in divorce in 1917, and by 1918 she was living with Franz Jung, although it was only in 1924 that the two of them married. The affair put an end to the friendship between Richard Oehring and Franz Jung. Following the divorce Oehring traveled to Vienna to visit Otto Gross. In Vienna he met Margarethe Kuh, a sister of Gross's friend, the writer Anton Kuh: Margarethe became Oehring's second wife. Their daughter, Aurora Miriam \"Mimi\" Oehring, was born in Berlin in March 1918. Richard Oehring now took work with Alfons Goldschmidt on the Berlin-based \"Räte-Zeitung\" (newspaper). During the period of acute austerity and turbulence on the streets that followed the end of the First World War Oehring also belonged, with his comrades Ernst Jacobi und Friedrich M. Minck, to the so-called \"Co-operative Council for Economic Reconstruction\" (\"Rätegenossenschaft für wirtschaftlichen Aufbau\").\n\nIn 1922 Oehring moved to the Soviet Union. By May 1923 he was back in Berlin, possibly on account of his wife's health. That month he wrote in a letter to \"Comrade\" , then in Konstanz, describing Margarethe's illness which he believed would be cured by plenty of rest and good food. In Berlin he worked as a trade representative for the Soviet Union, also participating in the film production unit of the Soviet sponsored Workers' International Relief (\"IAH – Internationale Arbeiter-Hilfe / Международная рабочая помощь\") organisation in Berlin. In 1931 he became a member of the \"Arplan\". Fellow members included Arvid Harnack, Georg Lukács, and Karl August Wittfogel. The commentator believes that Oehring probably accompanied the \"Arplan\" delegation that travelled to the Soviet Union in 1932, although his name is not included in the official list of delegates.\n\nJanuary 1933 brought régime change to Germany. Richard Oehrling and his family left the country the same year, relocating to the Netherlands where he worked for \"Exportchleb\", the Soviet trade organisation in the Netherlands, and at the same time undertaking work for the Soviet security services. While in the Netherlands he was in close contact with Ignace Reiss, a Soviet spy who fell foul of Moscow's shifting power structures and was shot by an NKVD assassin in Lausanne a few weeks after sending a letter to Party general secretary Stalin in which he announced his \"defection\", and support for Trotsky (who by this time had become a high-profile opponent of the Soviet dictator). While in the Netherlands Oehring recruited , the foreign correspondent of the \"Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (NRC)\" (newspaper), to work for Soviet intelligence. It is not clear whether Oehring's resignation from \"Exportchleb\" in 1939 was connected with the killing of Reiss. As an Economics advisor for the NRC, he provided the Rotterdam newspaper with Economics reports from the Soviet Union that were published in its business section. Huijts later recalled that Oehring was much troubled by his failure to obtain Soviet citizenship during the count-down to the Second World War.\n\nIn May 1940 the German army invaded the Netherlands and Richard Oehrling responded by committing suicide on 14 May, the day on which the Netherlands formally surrendered. During the German occupation Margarethe Oehrling was arrested and imprisoned, but both she and their daughter survived the war. Margarethe was still alive in 1977.\n"}
{"id": "369743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369743", "title": "Ruth Barcan Marcus", "text": "Ruth Barcan Marcus\n\nRuth Barcan Marcus (; born Ruth C. Barcan; August 2, 1921 – February 19, 2012) was an American philosopher and logician who developed the Barcan formula. She was a pioneer in the quantification of modal logic and the theory of direct reference, and conducted seminal research on identity, essentialism, possibilia, belief, moral conflict as well as some critical historical studies. Timothy Williamson, the Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford University, sums up his celebration of Professor Marcus's career by stating that many of her \"main ideas are not just original, and clever, and beautiful, and fascinating, and influential, and way ahead of their time, but actually — I believe — \"true\".\"\n\n\n\nRuth Barcan Marcus' earliest published work was the publication of the first axiomatic study of modal logic with quantifiers. These three ground-breaking articles were \"A Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication\", \"Journal of Symbolic Logic\" (JSL, 1946), \"The Deduction Theorem in a Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication\" (JSL, 1946), \"The Identity of Individuals in a Strict Functional Calculus of Second Order\", (JSL, 1947). The three articles are published under Marcus' maiden name: Ruth C. Barcan. The widely discussed Barcan formula is introduced as an axiom in QML. The papers of 1946 and 1947, were the first systems of quantified modal logic, which extended some propositional modal systems of Clarence Irving Lewis to first and second order; a major accomplishment in the development of 20th century logic. Lewis gives Marcus special recognition in his \"Notes on the Logic of Intension\", originally printed in \"Structure, Method, and Meaning: Essays in Honor of Henry M. Sheffer\" (New York, 1951). Here Lewis recognizes Barcan Marcus as the first logician to extend propositional logic as a higher order intensional logic.\n\nRuth Barcan Marcus proposed the view in the philosophy of language according to which proper names are what Marcus termed mere \"tags\" (\"Modalities and Intensional Languages\" (\"Synthese\", 1961) and elsewhere). According to her tag theory of names (a direct reference theory), these \"tags\" are used to refer to an object, which is the bearer of the name. The meaning of the name is regarded as exhausted by this referential function. This view contrasts for example with late Bertrand Russell's description theory of proper names as well as John Searle's cluster description theory of names which prevailed at the time. This view of proper names (presented in 1962 with Willard Van Orman Quine as commentator) has been identified by Quentin Smith with the theory of reference given in Saul Kripke's \"Naming and Necessity\". However, in a recent laudatio to Ruth Barcan Marcus, Professor Timothy Williamson says:\n\nThe philosopher of language Stephen Neale has also argued against Professor Smith's claim in the \"Times Literary Supplement\".\n\nMarcus formally proved the necessity of identity in 1946 and informally argued for it in 1961 and thereafter thus rejecting the possibility of contingent identity. See \"Journal of Symbolic Logic\", (1947) 12: pp 12–15\n\nMarcus prefers an interpretation where the domain of the interpretation comprises individual entities in the actual world. She also suggests that for some uses an alternative substitutional semantics is warranted. She provides arguments against possibilia. See \"Dispensing with Possibilia\" (Proceedings of the American Philosophical Association, 1975–76); \"Possibilia and Possible Worlds\" (\"Grazer Philosophische Studien\", 1985–86).\n\nMarcus defines a consistent set of moral principles as one in which there is some \"possible world \" in which they are all obeyable. That they may conflict in the actual world is not a mark of inconsistency. As in the case of necessity of identity, there was a resistance to this interpretation of moral conflict. Her argument counts against a widely received view that systems of moral rules are inevitably inconsistent.\n\nIt is proposed that believing is a relationship of an agent to a possible state of affairs under specified internal and external circumstances. Assenting to a quoted sentence (the disquotation account of belief) is only one behavioral marker of believing. Betting behavior is another. The wholly language-centered account of belief (e.g. Davidson) is rejected. Where an agent would traditionally be described as believing an impossibility until its impossibility was disclosed, Marcus proposes that under those circumstances the agent should say that she only claimed to believe an impossibility. In much the same way, when a mathematician discovers that one of his conjectures is false, and since if it is mathematically false it is impossible, he would say he only claimed that the conjecture was true. Odd as this proposal is, it is analogous to the widely accepted principle about knowing: if we claim to know P, and P turns out false, we do not say we used to know it, we say we were mistaken in so claiming.\n\nAristotelian Essentialism is concerned with properties which Marcus defines in the context of a modal framework. One proposal is that a property is essential if something has it, not everything has it, if something has it then it has it necessarily, and it is not wholly individuating \"e.g.\" a natural kind property. It is otherwise claimed by Quine and others that modal logic or semantics is committed to essentialist truths. Marcus argues informally that there are interpretations of some modal systems in which all essentialist claims are false. Terence Parsons later formally proved this result.\n\nAn alternative to Tarskian (model theoretic) semantics is proposed for some uses where \"the truth conditions for quantified formuli are given purely in terms of truth with no appeal to domains of interpretation\". (Later called by others \"truth value semantics\".) She shows that the claim that such a semantics leads to contradictions is false. Such a semantics may be of interest for mathematics \"e.g.\" Hartry Field, or for fictional discourse. Objectual quantification is required for interpretation of identity and other metaphysical categories.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13281443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13281443", "title": "Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce", "text": "Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce began writing on semiotics, which he also called semeiotics, meaning the philosophical study of signs, in the 1860s, around the time that he devised his system of three categories. During the 20th century, the term \"semiotics\" was adopted to cover all tendencies of sign researches, including Ferdinand de Saussure's semiology, which began in linguistics as a completely separate tradition. \n\nPeirce adopted the term \"semiosis\" (or \"semeiosis\") and defined it to mean an \"action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of \"three\" subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this trirelative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs\". This specific type of triadic relation is fundamental to Peirce's understanding of \"logic as formal semiotic\". By \"logic\" he meant philosophical logic. He eventually divided (philosophical) logic, or formal semiotics, into (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology on the elements of semiosis (sign, object, interpretant), how signs can signify and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs, objects, and interpretants there are, how signs combine, and how some signs embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative rhetoric, or methodeutic, the philosophical theory of inquiry, including his form of pragmatism. His speculative grammar, or stechiology, is this article's subject.\n\nPeirce conceives of and discusses things like representations, interpretations, and assertions broadly and in terms of philosophical logic, rather than in terms of psychology, linguistics, or social studies. He places philosophy at a level of generality between mathematics and the special sciences of nature and mind, such that it draws principles from mathematics and supplies principles to special sciences. On the one hand, his semiotic theory does not resort to special experiences or special experiments in order to settle its questions. On the other hand, he draws continually on examples from common experience, and his semiotics is not contained in a mathematical or deductive system and does not proceed chiefly by drawing necessary conclusions about purely hypothetical objects or cases. As philosophical logic, it is \"about\" the drawing of conclusions deductive, inductive, or hypothetically explanatory. Peirce's semiotics, in its classifications, its critical analysis of kinds of inference, and its theory of inquiry, is philosophical logic studied in terms of signs and their triadic relations as positive phenomena in general.\n\nHere is Peirce's definition of the triadic sign relation that formed the core of his definition of logic.\n\nNamely, a sign is something, \"A\", which brings something, \"B\", its \"interpretant\" sign determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence with something, \"C\", its \"object\", as that in which itself stands to \"C\". (Peirce 1902, NEM 4, 20–21).\n\nThis definition, together with Peirce's definitions of \"correspondence\" and \"determination\", is sufficient to derive all of the statements that are necessarily true for all sign relations. Yet, there is much more to the theory of signs than simply proving universal theorems about generic sign relations. There is also the task of classifying the various species and subspecies of sign relations. As a practical matter, of course, familiarity with the full range of concrete examples is indispensable to theory and application both.\n\nIn Peirce's theory of signs, a \"sign\" is something that stands in a well-defined kind of relation to two other things, its \"object\" and its \"interpretant sign\". Although Peirce's definition of a sign is independent of psychological subject matter and his theory of signs covers more ground than linguistics alone, it is nevertheless the case that many of the more familiar examples and illustrations of sign relations will naturally be drawn from linguistics and psychology, along with our ordinary experience of their subject matters.\n\nFor example, one way to approach the concept of an interpretant is to think of a psycholinguistic process. In this context, an interpretant can be understood as a sign's effect on the mind, or on anything that acts like a mind, what Peirce calls a \"quasi-mind\". An interpretant is what results from a process of interpretation, one of the types of activity that falls under the heading of \"semiosis\". One usually says that a sign stands \"for\" an object \"to\" an agent, an interpreter. In the upshot, however, it is the sign's effect on the agent that is paramount. This effect is what Peirce called the \"interpretant sign\", or the \"interpretant\" for short. An interpretant in its barest form is a sign's meaning, implication, or ramification, and especial interest attaches to the types of semiosis that proceed from obscure signs to relatively clear interpretants. In logic and mathematics the most clarified and most succinct signs for an object are called \"canonical forms\" or \"normal forms\".\n\nPeirce argued that logic is the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that \"all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs\", along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs:\n\nTo say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs. (Peirce, 1868)\nThought is not necessarily connected with a brain. It appears in the work of bees, of crystals, and throughout the purely physical world; and one can no more deny that it is really there, than that the colors, the shapes, etc., of objects are really there. Consistently adhere to that unwarrantable denial, and you will be driven to some form of idealistic nominalism akin to Fichte's. Not only is thought in the organic world, but it develops there. But as there cannot be a General without Instances embodying it, so there cannot be thought without Signs. We must here give \"Sign\" a very wide sense, no doubt, but not too wide a sense to come within our definition. Admitting that connected Signs must have a Quasi-mind, it may further be declared that there can be no isolated sign. Moreover, signs require at least two Quasi-minds; a Quasi-utterer and a Quasi-interpreter; and although these two are at one (i.e., are one mind) in the sign itself, they must nevertheless be distinct. In the Sign they are, so to say, welded. Accordingly, it is not merely a fact of human Psychology, but a necessity of Logic, that every logical evolution of thought should be dialogic. (Peirce, 1906 )\n\nSignhood is a way of being in relation, not a way of being in itself. Anything is a sign — not as itself, but in some relation to another. The role of sign is constituted as one role among three: object, sign, and interpretant sign. It is an irreducible triadic relation; the roles are distinct even when the things that fill them are not. The roles are but three: a sign of an object leads to interpretants, which, as signs, lead to further interpretants. In various relations, the same thing may be sign or semiotic object. The question of what a sign is depends on the concept of a \"sign relation\", which depends on the concept of a \"triadic relation\". This, in turn, depends on the concept of a \"relation\" itself. Peirce depended on mathematical ideas about the reducibility of relations — dyadic, triadic, tetradic, and so forth. According to Peirce's Reduction Thesis, (a) triads are necessary because genuinely triadic relations cannot be completely analyzed in terms of monadic and dyadic predicates, and (b) triads are sufficient because there are no genuinely tetradic or larger polyadic relations—all higher-arity \"n\"-adic relations can be analyzed in terms of triadic and lower-arity relations and are reducible to them. Peirce and others, notably Robert Burch (1991) and Joachim Hereth Correia and Reinhard Pöschel (2006), have offered proofs of the Reduction Thesis. According to Peirce, a genuinely monadic predicate characteristically expresses quality. A genuinely dyadic predicate — reaction or resistance. A genuinely triadic predicate — representation or mediation. Thus Peirce's theory of relations underpins his philosophical theory of three basic categories (see below).\n\n\"Extension × intension = information.\" Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of \"extension\" (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of \"intension\" (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of \"information\", including change of information, in order to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole. For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies. A proposition's comprehension consists in its implications.\n\n\"Determination.\" A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object — the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out especially when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object — the object determines the sign to determine the interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something \"as\" a sign representing an object. It is an informational kind of determination, a rendering of something more determinately representative. Peirce used the word \"determine\" not in strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of \"specializes\", \"bestimmt\", involving variation in measure, like an influence. Peirce came to define sign, object, and interpretant by their (triadic) mode of determination, not by the idea of representation, since that is part of what is being defined. The object determines the sign to determine another sign — the interpretant — to be related to the object \"as the sign is related to the object\", hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general. In semiosis, every sign is an interpretant in a chain stretching both fore and aft. The relation of informational or logical determination which constrains object, sign, and interpretant is more general than the special cases of causal or physical determination. In general terms, any information about one of the items in the sign relation tells you something about the others, although the actual amount of this information may be nil in some species of sign relations.\n\nPeirce held that there are exactly three basic semiotic elements, the sign, object, and interpretant, as outlined above and fleshed out here in a bit more detail:\n\nSome of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. In order to know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object collaterally to that sign or sign system, and in this context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.\n\n\"Representamen\" (properly with the \"a\" long and stressed: ) was adopted (not coined) by Peirce as his blanket technical term for any and every sign or sign-like thing covered by his theory. It is a question of whether the theoretically defined \"representamen\" covers only the cases covered by the popular word \"sign.\" The word \"representamen\" is there in case a divergence should emerge. Peirce's example was this: Sign action always involves a mind. If a sunflower, by doing nothing more than turning toward the sun, were thereby to become fully able to reproduce a sunflower turning in just the same way toward the sun, then the first sunflower's turning would be a representamen of the sun yet not a sign of the sun. Peirce eventually stopped using the word \"representamen.\"\n\nPeirce made various classifications of his semiotic elements, especially of the sign and the interpretant. Of particular concern in understanding the sign-object-interpretant triad is this: In relation to a sign, its object and its interpretant are either immediate (present in the sign) or mediate.\nThe immediate object is, from the viewpoint of a theorist, really a kind of sign of the dynamic object; but phenomenologically it \"is\" the object until there is reason to go beyond it, and somebody analyzing (critically but not theoretically) a given semiosis will consider the immediate object to be \"the\" object until there is reason to do otherwise.\n\nPeirce preferred phrases like \"dynamic object\" over \"real object\" since the object might be fictive — Hamlet, for instance, to whom one grants a fictive reality, a reality within the universe of discourse of the play \"Hamlet\".\n\nIt is initially tempting to regard immediate, dynamic, and final interpretants as forming a temporal succession in an actual process of semiosis, especially since their conceptions refer to beginning, midstages, and end of a semiotic process. But instead their distinctions from each other are modal or categorial. The immediate interpretant is a quality of impression which a sign is fitted to produce, a special potentiality. The dynamic interpretant is an actuality. The final interpretant is a kind of norm or necessity unaffected by actual trends of opinion or interpretation. One does not actually obtain a final interpretant per se; instead one may successfully \"coincide\" with it. Peirce, a fallibilist, holds that one has no guarantees that one has done so, but only compelling reasons, sometimes very compelling, to think so and, in practical matters, must sometimes act with complete confidence of having done so. (Peirce said that it is often better in practical matters to rely on instinct, sentiment, and tradition, than on theoretical inquiry.) In any case, insofar as truth is the final interpretant of a pursuit of truth, one believes, in effect, that one coincides with a final interpretant of some question about what is true, whenever and to whatever extent that one believes that one reaches a truth.\n\nPeirce proposes several typologies and definitions of the signs. More than 76 definitions of what a sign is have been collected throughout Peirce's work. Some canonical typologies can nonetheless be observed, one crucial one being the distinction between \"icons\", \"indices\" and \"symbols\" (CP 2.228, CP 2.229 and CP 5.473). The icon-index-symbol typology is chronologically the first but structurally the second of three that fit together as a trio of three-valued parameters in regular scheme of nine kinds of sign. (The three \"parameters\" (not Peirce's term) are not independent of one another, and the result is a system of ten classes of sign, which are shown further down in this article.)\n\nPeirce's three basic phenomenological categories come into central play in these classifications. The 1-2-3 numerations used further below in the exposition of sign classes represents Peirce's associations of sign classes with the categories. The categories are as follows:\nThe three sign typologies depend respectively on (I) the sign itself, (II) how the sign stands for its denoted object, and (III) how the signs stands for its object to its interpretant. Each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a trichotomy, via Peirce's three phenomenological categories.\n\n\nEvery sign falls under one class or another within (I) \"and\" within (II) and' within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications aren't found. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.\n\nIn later years, Peirce attempted a finer level of analysis, defining sign classes in terms of relations not just to sign, object, and interpretant, but to sign, immediate object, dynamic object, immediate interpretant, dynamic interpretant, and final or normal interpretant. He aimed at 10 trichotomies of signs, with the above three trichotomies interspersed among them, and issuing in 66 classes of signs. He did not bring that system into a finished form. In any case, in that system, icon, index, and symbol were classed by category of how they stood for the dynamic object, while rheme, dicisign, and argument were classed by the category of how they stood to the final or normal interpretant.\n\nThese conceptions are specific to Peirce's theory of signs and are not exactly equivalent to general uses of the notions of \"icon\", \"index\", \"symbol\", \"tone\", \"token\", \"type\", \"term\" (or \"rheme\"), \"proposition\" (or \"dicisign), \"argument\".\n\nAlso called \"tone, token, type\"; and also called \"potisign, actisign, famisign\".\n\nThis is the typology of the sign as distinguished by \"sign's own\" phenomenological category (set forth in 1903, 1904, etc.).\n\n\nA \"replica\" (also called \"instance\") of a legisign is a sign, often an actual individual one (a sinsign), which embodies that legisign. A replica is a sign for the associated legisign, and therefore is also a sign for the legisign's object. All legisigns need sinsigns as replicas, for expression. Some but not all legisigns are symbols. All symbols are legisigns. Different words with the same meaning are symbols which are replicas of that symbol which consists in their meaning but doesn't prescribe qualities of its replicas.\n\nThis is the typology of the sign as distinguished by phenomenological category of its way of denoting the \"object\" (set forth in 1867 and many times in later years). This typology emphasizes the different ways in which the sign refers to its object — the icon by a quality of its own, the index by real connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant. The modes may be compounded, for instance, in a sign that displays a forking line iconically for a fork in the road and stands indicatively near a fork in the road.\n\n\n * \"Note:\" in \"On a New List of Categories\" (1867) Peirce gave the unqualified term \"sign\" as an alternate expression for \"index\", and gave \"general sign\" as an alternate expression for \"symbol\". \"Representamen\" was his blanket technical term for any and every sign or signlike thing covered by his theory. Peirce soon reserved \"sign\" to its broadest sense, for index, icon, and symbol alike. He also eventually decided that the symbol is not the only sign which can be called a \"general sign\" in some sense, and that indices and icons can be generals, generalities, too. The general sign, as such, the generality as a sign, he eventually called, at various times, the \"legisign\" (1903, 1904), the \"type\" (1906, 1908), and the \"famisign\" (1908).\n\nThis is the typology of the sign as distinguished by the phenomenological category which the sign's interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting the object (set forth in 1902, 1903, etc.):\n\n\n *\"Note:\" In his \"Prolegomena To an Apology For Pragmaticism\" (The \"Monist\", v. XVI, no. 4, Oct. 1906), Peirce uses the words \"seme\", \"pheme\", and \"delome\" (pp. 506, 507, etc.) for the rheme-dicisign-argument typology, but retains the word \"rheme\" for the predicate (p. 530) in his system of Existential Graphs. Also note that Peirce once offered \"seme\" as an alternate expression for \"index\" in 1903.\n\nThe three typologies, labeled \"I.\", \"II.\", and \"III.\", are shown together in the table below. As parameters, they are not independent of one another. As previously said, many co-classifications aren't found. The slanting and vertical lines show the options for co-classification of a given sign (and appear in MS 339, August 7, 1904, viewable here at the Lyris peirce-l archive). The result is ten classes of sign.\n\nWords in parentheses in the table are alternate names for the same kinds of signs. \n\n *\"Note:\" As noted above, in \"On a New List of Categories\" (1867) Peirce gave the unqualified word \"sign\" as an alternate expression for \"index\", and gave \"general sign\" as an alternate expression for \"symbol.\" Peirce soon reserved \"sign\" to its broadest sense, for index, icon, and symbol alike, and eventually decided that symbols are not the only signs which can be called \"general signs\" in some sense. See note at end of section \"II. Icon, index, symbol\" for details.<br>\nNote that a term (in the conventional sense) is not just any rheme; it is a kind of rhematic symbol. Likewise a proposition (in the conventional sense) is not just any dicisign, it is a kind of dicent symbol.\n\nFor abbreviations of his works see Abbreviations\n\n"}

The \"San Francisco Call\" stated that she was \"the first Chinese woman in the history of the world to exercise the electoral franchise.\" Schulze was also the first Chinese woman hired to work at Angel Island. She is a designated Women's History Month Honoree by the National Women's History Project.\n\nTye Leung was born in San Francisco, California in 1887. She was one of eight children and her father was a Chinese cobbler while her mother ran a boarding house. As a teenager she was placed in an arranged marriage to a man in Butte, Montana. At 14 she was saved from the arranged marriage by Donaldina Cameron of the Presbyterian Mission Home. At the Mission she learned to speak English, studied Christianity, and helped Cameron rescue Chinese slaves by acting as an interpreter.\n\nLeung was the first Chinese American to pass the civil service examinations and she was hired to work as an assistant to the matron at the Angel Island Immigration Station. There she would work with Chinese immigrants who were detained for physical examinations and interrogation upon their arrival.\n\nIn 1912 Leung was the first Chinese woman to vote in a primary election. After voting the \"San Francisco Examiner\" called the vote \"the last word in the modern movement for the complete enfranchisement of women...It was the latest achievement in the great American work of amalgamating and lifting up all the races of the earth.\" \n\nAt Angel Island she would meet immigration inspector Charles Schulze. Intermarriage of Chinese and white Americans was illegal in California so the couple went to Vancouver, Washington to be legally married. They were married in October 1913. They had to quit their government jobs after the marriage due to racial prejudice. Schulze went to work for the Southern Pacific Company as an \"inspector of office machines\", and then as a superintendent of service for the Columbia Gramaphone Company. The couple had four children. Schulze died in 1935 and Leung served as a bookkeeper at the San Francisco Chinese Hospital to support her family. Leung went to work as a night-shift PBX operator at the Chinatown telephone exchange. She spent many years providing interpretation and social services to San Francisco's Chinatown residents. She passed at the approximate age of 85.\n\nIn October 2011 the story of Tye Leung Schulze was told through a play starring actress Lily Tung.\n\n"}
{"id": "25574050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25574050", "title": "Udmurt grammar", "text": "Udmurt grammar\n\nThis article deals with the grammar of the Udmurt language.\n\nUdmurt pronouns are inflected much in the same way that their referent nouns are. However, personal pronouns are only inflected in the grammatical cases and cannot be inflected in the locative cases.\n\nSomewhat like in English, Udmurt personal pronouns are used to refer to human beings only. However, the third person singular can be referred to \"it\". Udmurt personal pronouns only inflect in the grammatical cases and the approximative case. The nominative case of personal pronouns are listed in the following table:\n\nUdmurt reflexive pronouns only inflect in the grammatical cases and the approximative case. The nominative case of reflexive pronouns are listed in the following table:\n\nUdmurt interrogative pronouns inflect in all cases. However, the inanimate interrogative pronouns 'what' in the locative cases have the base form \"кыт-\". The nominative case of interrogative pronouns are listed in the following table:\n\nThe following table shows Udmurt interrogative pronouns in all the cases:\n\nUdmurt does not distinguish gender in nouns or even in personal pronouns: 'со' = 'he' or 'she' depending on the referent.\n\nUdmurt has fifteen noun cases: eight grammatical cases and seven locative cases. Notice that the word in a given locative case modifies the verb, not a noun. The locative cases can only be used with inanimate references with the exception of the approximative case.\n\nUdmurt case endings affix directly to nouns quite regularly with the exception of a few lexemes of Uralic origin. These lexemes have stem changes when declining in the locative cases whose endings begin with a vowel:\n\nThe personal pronouns, however, have irregularities in comparison to the declension of other nouns:\n\nThere are two types of nominal plurals in Udmurt. One is the plural for nouns \"-ос/-ëс\" and the other is the plural for adjectives \"-эсь/-есь\".\n\nThe noun is always in plural. In attributive plural phrases, the adjective is not required to be in the plural:\n\nThe plural marker always comes before other endings (i.e. cases and possessive suffixes) in the morphological structure of plural nominal.\n\nAs in Hungarian, if the subject is plural, the adjective is always plural when it functions as the sentence's predicative:\n\nNouns are ordinarily in the singular when following cardinal numbers. However, a living being as the sentence's subject may be in the plural. In this case, the predicate verb must be in congruency with the subject.\n\nUdmurt possessive suffixes are added to the end of nouns either before or after a case ending. The possessive suffixes vary in the nominative and accusative cases and with case endings. The consonant of the second and third person plural depends on if the last phoneme of the word is voiced or unvoiced.\n\nCertain lexemes of Finno-Ugric origin (especially those ending with a vowel or meaning an inalienable object) contain the vowel \"-ы-\" in the first, second and third person singular nominative possessive suffixes:\n\nAccusative possessive suffixes are shown in the following table. The consonant of the second and third person singular and plural depends on if the last phoneme of the word is voiced or unvoiced.\n\nThe morphological placement of possessive suffixes with other endings depends on the case. Possessive suffixes are the same as nominative suffixes after which the genitive, ablative, dative, abessive, adverbial and approximative cases agglutinates.\n\nThe possessive suffix follows the instrumental, inessive, illative, elative egressive, terminative and prolative cases and the vowel reduces to \"ы\" in the singular persons. An \"м\", an old Uralic first person singular marker, appears in the first person singular. When adding a possessive suffix, the inessive and illative forms change to \"-а-\" and the elative form changes to \"-ысьт-\". The \"ы\" does not appear in the inessive, illative, terminative and prolative cases where the case ends with a vowel.\n\nAs in the singular, possessive suffixes precede the genitive, ablative, dative, abessive, adverbial and approximative cases. However, the vowel of the singular persons reduce to \"ы\":\n\nAs in the singular, possessive suffixes follow the instrumental, inessive, illative, elative, egressive, terminative and prolative cases. The suffix forms follow the same structure as in the singular. The same exceptions appear in the plural as in the singular with the added exception of the instrumental \"э/е\" reducing to \"ы\" and the prolative \"э/е\" not used.\n\nSome words can be used as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs without a change in form. For example, чылкыт \"\" means \"cleanliness\", \"clean\", and \"clearly\".\n\nThe third person singular possessive suffix also acts as a definite article: удмурт кыл(ыз) чебер udmurt kyliz č´eber (\"the Udmurt language is nice\" – literally \"Udmurt language's nice\").\n\nThere is no congruency between adjectives and nouns in neutral Udmurt noun phrases, i.e. there is no adjective declension as in the inessive noun phrase \"бадӟым гуртын, 'in a large/big village' (cf. Finnish inessive phrase \"isossa kylässä 'in a large/big village', in which \"iso\" 'big/large' is inflected according to the head noun). However, as stated earlier, Udmurt adjectives in neutral attributive (non-predicative) noun phrases may have a plural marker when the noun is pluralised.\n\nUdmurt does have an emphasising determinative suffix. Its function is to place emphasis on the features of the referent, defining and separating it from a group of other similar referents. The third person singular possessive suffix \"-ез/-эз\" and \"-из\" and plural \"-ыз\" acts as the determinative suffix. The determinative adjective conjugates as in the third person singular or plural and the noun conjugates without any other marker.\n\nComparative is used when two referents are compared to each other but the subject of comparison does not necessarily need to be expressed.\n\nThe comparative suffix in Udmurt is \"-гес\". The subject of comparison can be expressed either in the ablative case or with the postposition \"сярысь\" structure. If the subject of comparison it is shown the comparative suffix can be left out.\n\nThere is no superlative suffix in Udmurt. Superlative is expressed with the Russian particle \"самой\" or indefinitive expressions \"ваньмызлэсь\", \"котькинлэсь\" or \"котьмалэсь\".\n\nUdmurt makes use of postpositions rather than prepositions. A large percentage of the stems of Udmurt postpositions have a locative meaning and can conjugate in the local cases. For example, \"выл\" means 'top' and also 'surface' and can inflect in all the locative cases: (inessive) \"вылын\", (elative) \"вылысь\", (illative) \"вылэ\", (prolative) \"вылтӥ\", (eggressive) \"вылысен\", (termanitive) \"вылозь\" and (approximative) \"выллань\".\n\nHowever less than the seven locative cases are included in paradigm inflection of many of the postpositions. The paradigm usually consists of the inessive, elative and illative cases. Like nominals of foreign Uralic origin, some postpositions have a consonant in their stem. such as \"вис(к-)\", 'between'.\n\nSome common postpositions are:\n\nThe illative case can vary between \"-э/-е\" and \"-ы\". The illative form of the postposition \"пал\" 'side' is \"пала\" 'to the side of'.\n\nThere is also a small group of non-inflecting postpositions in addition to those inflecting in the locative cases (cf. Finnish \"kanssa\" \"with (a person)\" that always takes the genitive case: \"ystävän kanssa\" \"with a friend\"). A few examples of these are:\n\nMost of the nouns in Udmurt postposition phrases are inflected in the nominative but there are a few postpositions that require the noun to be in the dative, ablative or instrumental cases:\n\nUdmurt verbs are divided into two groups or two conjugations, both having the infinitive marker \"-ны\". The conjugation I type verb is structured with \"ы\" as in \"мыныны, 'to go'. The conjugation II type verb features an \"-а-\" in the infinitive as in \"ужаны, 'to work'. The conjugation I verb can also have two stems, a full stem as in \"мыны-\" and a short stem as in \"мын-\".\n\nThere are three verbal moods in Udmurt: indicative, conditional and imperative. There is also an optative mood used in certain dialects. The indicative mood has four tenses: present, future, and two past tenses. In addition there are four past tense structures which include auxiliary verbs. Verbs are negated by use of an auxiliary negative verb that conjugates with personal endings. Separate personal pronouns are not required in verb phrases.\n\nThe basic verbal personal markers in Udmurt are (with some exceptions):\n\nPresent tense in Udmurt, in all but the third person, is marked with \"-(ӥ)сько-/-(и)сько-\". Third person singular is marked with \"-э/-е\" (conjugation I) or unmarked (conjugation II) and third person plural is marked with \"-о\" (conjugation I) or \"-ло\" (conjugation II).\n\nThe negative indicative present is formed by the auxiliary \"у-\" negative verb and the marker \"-(ӥ)ськы/-(и)ськы\" in the first and second person singular or \"-(ӥ)ське/-(и)ське\" in the first and second plural of the main verb. The third person singular main verb is either marked by the full stem (conjugation I) or unmarked (conjugation II). The third person plural is marked with \"-о\" (conjugation I) or \"-ло\" (conjugation II).\n\nThe negative verb conjugates with the ending \"-г\" in first and third person singular and third person plural. Second person singular and plural both conjugate with the ending \"-д\" and first person plural with \"-м\".\n\nThe future tense in Udmurt is marked with \"-о-\" in conjugation I verbs and \"-ло-\" in conjugation II verbs.\n\nThe negative indicative future is formed by the auxiliary \"у-\" negative verb and the stem of the main verb in singular persons. The plural persons are marked either with \"-э/-е\" (conjugation I) or \"-лэ\" (conjugation II)\n\nThe negative verb conjugates with the ending \"-г\" in first person singular. Third person singular and third person plural have the ending \"-з\" and the remaining are as in present negative.\n\nThe conventionally used designations \"preterite\" and \"perfect\" are used with denotations which are divergent from their usual meanings in the grammar of other languages.\n\nThe first preterite can be compared with the simple past in English. Preterite I is marked with \"ӥ/и\" in conjugation I. There is no past tense marker in conjugation II verbs with the exception of \"й\" in the first person singular.\n\nThe negative preterite I is formed by the auxiliary \"ӧ-\" negative verb and the stem of the main verb in singular persons. The plural persons are marked either with \"-э/-е\" (conjugation I) or \"-лэ\" (conjugation II)\n\nThe negative verb conjugates with the ending \"-й\" in first person singular. Third person singular and third person plural have the ending \"-з\" and the remaining are as in present negative.\n\nThe second preterite is a past tense with an evidentiality distinction. It can be compared to the English perfect in which the speaker did not personally observe the past event. The preterite II is marked with \"(э)м/(е)м\", which is historically related to the third infinitive in Finnish.\n\nIn addition to the normal personal endings, the present indicative marker \"-(ӥ)ськ-/-(и)ськ-\" is featured in first persons and a frequentive verbal marker \"-лля-\" is present in the second and third person plural. There is no personal ending in the third person singular and sometimes featured in the third person plural.\n\nThe negative preterite II is formed either by including the auxiliary copular negative verb \"ӧвӧл\" 'is not' or with the negation marker \"-мтэ-\".\n\nThere are four past tenses in Udmurt which use a preterite form of the main verb and a preterite form of the auxiliary verb 'to be'.\n\nThe Udmurt pluperfect makes use of the preterite I main verb and the auxiliary \"вал\", 'was' in third person singular, also in simple past. The pluperfect I tense expresses a process of action that has happened in the (distant) past.\n\nThe negative Pluperfect I is formed by the negative preterite I negative plus the auxiliary \"вал\".\n\nThere are two structures of the pluperfect II tense. One uses the preterite II third person singular form of the main verb inflected with a personal possessive suffix and the auxiliary \"вал\". The other is the preterite II of the main verb (with normal personal inflection) and the preterite I form of the 'to' be verb \"вылэм\". The pluperfect II tense expresses the result of an action that has been completed, but no one had seen.\n\nThe negative pluperfect II is formed either by with the preterite II third person singular of the main verb in the negative (marked with \"-мтэ-\") with a personal possessive suffix and the auxiliary verb \"вал\" (pluperfect II a) or with the negative preterite II of the main verb marked with \"-мтэ-\" with the preterite II auxiliary verb \"вылэм\".\n\nThe durative preterite in Udmurt can be compared to the past progressive in English \"was doing\". Its function can be described as expressing a process in the past. The structure is the present tense of the main verb with either preterite of the auxiliary verb. The structure of the negative durative preterite is the negative present tense of the main verb with either preterite of the auxiliary verb.\n\nThe frequentative preterite in Udmurt expresses a repeated action in the past. The structure is the future tense of the main verb with either preterite of the auxiliary verb. The structure of the negative frequentative preterite is the negative future tense of the main verb with either preterite of the auxiliary verb.\n\nUdmurt does not have a separate affix to express a passive voice. The plural third person of the verb is used as a personal form to express an unknown, non-determinative actor.\n\nThe conditional mood expresses an unrealistic action which the speaker considers to be supposed, possible or hopeful. The conditional marker is \"-сал\" and is attached to the stem of the verb (i.e. full stem of conjugation I verbs) along with personal endings. The third person singular, however, can function without a personal ending. The first person singular preterite I negative verb \"ӧй\" is used in the negative conditional.\n\nThe stem of the verb is used for the second person singular imperative in Udmurt. If the stem of a conjugation I verb ends in one consonant or is one syllable and ends in a vowel, the short stem is the imperative. If the stem of a conjugation I verb ends in two consonants, the full stem is used.\n\nThe second person plural infinitive is marked with \"-е(лэ)/-э(лэ)\" in conjugation I verbs and \"-лэ\" in conjugation I verbs.\n\nThe imperative negative auxiliary is \"эн\" which precedes the infinitive form.\n\nUdmurt makes use of the morphosyntactic structure of inflected nominals and verbs with an auxiliary for modal expressions.\n\nTo express ability, the verb \"луынын\", 'to be' is inflected in the third person singular (in all tenses) with the subject in the genitive case. The verb to which the subject directs ability is inflected with the past participle \"(э)м/(е)м\" (preterite II, third person singular) with a personal possessive suffix.\n\nThe desiderative modal expresses desire. The verb \"потынын\", 'to want' is inflected in the third person singular (in all tenses) with the subject in the genitive case. The verb to which the subject directs the desire is inflected with the past participle \"(э)м/(е)м\" (preterite II, third person singular) with a personal possessive suffix.\n\nTo express necessity, the word \"кулэ\", 'necessary' is used with the copula verb inflected in the third person singular (in all tenses) with the subject in the dative case. The infinitive of the verb to which the subject directs necessity or an object is used.\n\nTo express permissiveness, the verb \"яраны\", 'to suit/to be valid' is inflected in the third person singular (in all tenses) with the subject in the dative case. The infinitive of the verb to which the subject directs permissiviness is used.\n\nUdmurt verbs have past, present and future participles. Participles can be used in different ways than ordinary adjectives. In addition to affirmative participles, Udmurt also has caritive participles.\n\nThe present participle is \"-(ӥ)сь/-(и)сь\". It is a participle which expresses continuous action. It is affixed to short stems in conjugation I verbs. The present participle caritive is \"-(ӥ)сьтэм/-(и)сьтэм\"\n\nIn addition to functioning as regular attributive participles, the present participle also functions as a nominalising derivational suffix.\n\nThe past participle is \"-(э)м/-(е)м\". It is an attributive participle which expresses completed action. It is affixed to short stems in conjugation I verbs. The past participle caritive is \"-(э)мтэ/-(е)мтэ\".\n\nThe past participle can also be inflected with the inessive ending \"-(э)мын/-(е)мын\". This is a predicative participle which expresses completed action.\n\nThe modal-future participle is \"-(о)но\". It is affixed to short stems in conjugation I verbs. The future participle caritive is \"-(о)нтэм\" and expresses that which is unable to be done.\n\nThere is also a modal participle similar to gerunds in function. It expresses the ability to do some action or that it is possible to do the action. The marker is \"-мон\" and it is affixed to short stems in conjugation I verbs.\n\nThere are four gerunds in Udmurt, one being a caritive. that are affixed to the verb's full stem. One gerund, which also has a caritive, is formed by the past participle \"(э)м/(е)м\" (preterite II, third person singular) with the instrumental or elative case.\n\nThe \"basic\" \"-са\" gerund (and its caritive \"-тэк\") can be compared to the English present active participle \"-ing\" and Finnish second or third infinitives, however having more functions. They can express a way of doing something, a reason for the action or a certain condition.\n\nThe temporal \"-ку\" gerund (\"-кы\" in southern dialects) expresses action or state of being which happens simultaneously with the action of the main verb of the clause.\n\nThe fourth gerund is \"-тозь\" which can express an action or an event that lasts to the starting or ending limit of the action expressed by the predicate verb of the sentence. The gerund also expresses the structure \"instead of\". In addition, possessive suffixes can be affixed after the \"-тозь\" gerund.\n\nThe past participle gerund is inflected with either the instrumental \"-(э)мен/-(е)мен\" (caritive \"-мтэен\") or elative \"-(э)мысь/-(е)мысь\" (caritive \"-мтэысь\") case, both having the basic same meaning of \"because\". In literary Udmurt, the gerund in the instrumental case is preferred. However, the gerund in the eleative case is used with some verbs such as \"дугдыны\" 'to cease/stop'.\n\nPersonal possessive suffixes can also be affixed to \"-(э)м-/-(е)ме-\" gerunds:\n\nIf there are no interrogative (question) words (who, what, when etc.), an interrogative phrase is formed by the suffix \"-а\". The interrogative suffix is affixed to the constituent to which the question is concerned. The suffix's placement can also vary according to dialect. Both southern and northern dialect forms are used in literary Udmurt.\n\nThere are a few main derivational suffixes in Udmurt word formation.\n\nUdmurt has the productive deverbalising nominal suffix \"-(о)н/-(ë)н\". \"-(о)н/-(ë)н\" is affixed to the short stem of conjugation I verbs and \"-н\" affixes directly to the stem of conjugation II verbs The function of this suffix is quite diverse. With this deverbalising affix, the nominal usually:\n\n1. expresses the action (deverbalised noun) set out by the base verb:\n\n2. expresses the result of action:\n\n3. expresses an instrument or tool denoted by an action:\n\n4. expresses the focus of action:\n\nMost of these derivations have both abstract and concrete meanings. The derivation can expresses both the action set out by the base verb or result or instrument:\n\nDeverbalised nominal derivations can function as qualifiers of collocations, such as \"лыдӟон книга\" 'reader, digest' or \"юон ву\" 'drinking water'.\n\nUdmurt has the denominalising adjectival suffixes \"-о/-ë\" and carritive \"-тэм\". The adjectives formed by the suffix \"-о/-ë\" express the condition of a quality, feature or phenomenon of the base word or possession of the referent. The adjectives formed by the suffix \"-тэм\" express the lack of quality, feature, phenomenon or referent. This suffix can be compared to the prefix \"un-\" or suffix \"-less\" in English.\n\nAdjectives formed by the \"-ӧ\" suffix can also have a qualifier:\n\nUdmurt also has moderative adjectival suffixes (\"-алэс\", \"-мыт\" and \"-пыр(ъем)\") which express a somewhat large, but not complete, amount of quality of an adjective base, usually a colour or flavour. They can be compared to the English suffix \"-ish\". The suffix \"-мыт\" does not normally associate with flavour, but Southern dialect variant \"-пыр(ъем)\" does.\n\nIn Udmurt grammar, the lexical aspect (aktionsart) of verbs is called verbal aspect. Udmurt verbs can be divided into two categories: momentane verbs and frequentative verbs. The transitivity or of a verb mainly relies on if the verb is frequentative or not.\n\nIn Udmurt word formation, verbs can be derived by frequentative or causative deverbalising suffixes.\n\nThe momentane aspect of Udmurt verbs expresses action (state of being or process) that happens only once. There is no transparent base momentane marker (cf. Finnish momentane verbs). For example, \"лыӟыны\" 'to read (once)'. However a causative \"-т-\" denotes momentanity and those verbs can be derived into frequentative verbs.\n\nThe frequentative aspect expresses that the action (state of being or process) does not happen just one time. The action is continuous or frequent. There are various frequentative markers, usually containing an \"л\", for example \"лыӟылыны\" 'to read (frequently/often)'. The frequentative aspect, however, does not denote continuous repetitiveness as in e.g.some Finnish frequentative derivations.\n\nThe frequentative deverbalising affixes in Udmurt are \"-лы-\" (conjugation I), \"-лля-\" (conjugation II) (both historically related to the Finnish frequentative derivational suffix \"-ele-\") and \"-а-/-я-\" (conjugation I) which precede the infinitive marker \"ны\".\n\nSome verbal derivations, that follow the pattern \"потыны\" → \"потаны\", have parallel frequentative derivations, and \"-лля-\" can be affixed to an already frequentatised derivation:\n\n\"тубыны\" 'to rise' → \"тубылыны\" 'to rise (often)'\n\n\"тубыны\" 'to rise' → \"тубаны\" → \"тубалляны\" 'to rise (often)'\n\nAnother frequentative verb affix is \"-иськы-/-ӥськы-\", which is historically related to the Finnish frequentative derivational suffix \"-skele-\". \"-иськы-/-ӥськы-\" frequentative verbs can be considered different from the above-mentioned derivations. \"-иськы-/-ӥськы-\" verbs do not semantically denote frequency in the same way; their \"ofteness\" is related to objective or non-objective relation. For example, the verb \"лыдӟыны\" ('to read') requires an object and the verb \"лыдӟиськыны\" does not.\n\nUdmurt is an SOV language.\n\nThe copular verb (вань ', – \"to be\") is omitted if the sentence is in the present tense: туннэ кыӵе нунал? ' (\"What day is it today?\"). If the sentence expresses possession, the ' can be part of the predicate: тӥ палан нюлэсъёс вань-а\"? ' (\"At you (plur.), are there forests?\")\n\nThese are sentences which introduce a new subject – they often begin with 'there is' or 'there are' in English.\nAs in most Uralic languages, ownership in Udmurt is expressed by inflection and sentence structure, rather than with a separate verb 'have'. The owner of the object and the possessed object are both inflected with a possessive suffix and used with the copula verb to express ownership.\n"}

Kannada, Tamil, Arabic, Old Hungarian, Hebrew, Georgian, and Hangul are unicase alphabets, while (modern) Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Armenian are \"bicameral\", as they have two cases for each letter, e.g., B/b, Β/β, Б/б, Բ/բ. Individual characters can also be called unicameral if they are used as letters with a generally bicameral alphabet but have only one form for both cases; for example, ʻokina (), used in Polynesian languages, and glottal stop (ʔ) as used in Nuu-chah-nuulth.\n\nAll alphabets with case were once unicase. Latin, for example, used to be written with a unicase alphabet in imperial Roman times; it was only later that scribes developed new sets of symbols for running text, which became the lower case of the Latin alphabet, while the letterforms of Ancient Rome came to be called capitals or upper case.\n\nThe Georgian alphabet, on the other hand, has developed in the other direction: in the medieval period, Georgian also had two sets of letters available for bicameral writing, but the use of two cases later gave way to a unicameral system. The ecclesiastical form of the Georgian alphabet, Khutsuri, had an upper case called Asomtavruli (like the Ancient Roman capitals) and a lower case called Nuskhuri (like the medieval Latin scribal forms). Out of Nuskhuri came a secular alphabet called Mkhedruli, which is the unicase Georgian alphabet in use today.\n\nA unicase version of the Latin alphabet was proposed by Michael Mann and David Dalby in 1982 as a variation of the Niamey African Reference Alphabet. This version has apparently never been actively used. Another example of unicase Latin alphabet is the Initial Teaching Alphabet. Occasionally some fonts use unicase designs to create an unusual effect; this was particularly popular in the 1960s.\n\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet only uses lowercase Latin (and Greek) letters and some scaled upper-case letters (small caps), effectively making it a unicase alphabet, although it is not used for actual writing of any language.\n\n\n"}
