Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic theologians have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the theology of the Eucharist, particularly the transubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood. In this example, the bread and wine are considered accidents, since at transubstantiation, they become incidental to the essential substance of body and blood. \n\nIn modern philosophy, an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: property and contingency. Non-essentialism argues that every property is an accident. Modal necessitarianism argues that all properties are essential and no property is an accident.\n\nAristotle made a distinction between the essential and accidental properties of a thing. For example, a chair can be made of wood or metal, but this is accidental to its being a chair: that is, it is still a chair regardless of the material from which it is made. To put this in technical terms, an accident is a property which has no necessary connection to the essence of the thing being described.\n\nTo take another example, all bachelors are unmarried: this is a necessary or essential property of what it means to be a bachelor. A particular bachelor may have brown hair, but this would be a property particular to that individual, and with respect to his bachelorhood it would be an accidental property. And this distinction is independent of experimental verification: even if for some reason all the unmarried men with non-brown hair were killed, and every single existent bachelor had brown hair, the property of having brown hair would still be accidental, since it would still be logically possible for a bachelor to have hair of another color.\n\nThe nine kinds of accidents according to Aristotle are quantity, quality, relation, habitus, time, location, situation (or position), action, and passion (\"being acted on\"). Together with \"substance\", these nine kinds of accidents constitute the ten fundamental categories of Aristotle's ontology.\n\nCatholic theologians such as Thomas Aquinas have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the theology of the Eucharist, particularly the transubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood. According to this tradition, the accidents (or \"species\") of the appearance of bread and wine do not change, but the substance changes from bread and wine to the Body and Blood of Christ.\n\nIn modern philosophy, an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: property and contingency. In relation to the first, an accidental property (Greek \"symbebekos\") is at its most basic level a \"property\". The color \"yellow\", \"high value\", \"Atomic Number 79\" are all properties, and are therefore candidates for being accidental. On the other hand, \"gold\", \"platinum\", and \"electrum\" are not properties, and are therefore not classified as accidents.\n\nThere are two opposed philosophical positions that also impact the meaning of this term:\n\n"}

She taught school until 1979, and was the Cultural Liaison for the City of Divinópolis from 1983 to 1988.\n\nHer poetry was \"discovered\" in 1976, when at the age of 40 she sent a small collection of her poems to poet Affonso Romano de Sant’Anna. De Sant'Anna passed her work on to the Brazilian modernist poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade, who read it and proclaimed in his weekly newspaper column that St. Francis was dictating lines to a housewife in Minas Gerais. Her work is a seeming paradox of a deep and spiritual Catholicism combined with the physical and the carnal. She herself has tried to resolve this contradiction, writing that \"It's the soul that's erotic.\" She is especially focused on the everyday concerns of women. Adélia has published eight volumes of poetry and seven volumes of prose, starting with her first poetry collection \"Bagegem\" (Baggage). In describing her work, Robert Hass said \"Brazil has produced what might seem impossible: a really sexy, mystical, Catholic poet.\"\n\nThough she does her best to avoid the limelight, Prado is considered one of Brazil's foremost poets. Her work has been translated into English, Italian, and Spanish, and has been written about extensively in the critical and popular press in Brazil.\n\nAdélia Prado has a long relationship with American poet and translator Ellen Doré Watson, who has translated several collections of Prado's poetry. They are:\nPrado's work has also been published in translation in \"The Paris Review\", \"Antaeus\", \"Field\", and \"American Poetry Review\".

This has led some scholars to conjecture that this person's full, correct name may have been \"Flavus Alfius Avitus\". All this is very uncertain. We know from the ancient grammarian Terentianus that Alphius Avitus composed a work about \"Illustrious Men\", in iambic dimeters, extending to several books; and eight lines are cited by Priscian from the second book, forming a part of the legend of the Faliscan schoolteacher who betrayed his students to Marcus Furius Camillus; besides which, three lines more from the first book are contained in some manuscripts of the same grammarian.

This error rests on misunderstanding the word \"argument\". \"Argument\" can mean \"a series of persuasive statements\" (the legal sense discussed in this article) as well as \"a verbal fight or disagreement\". Thus, an argumentative objection may be raised only when the lawyer himself is making a legal argument under the guise of asking a question. \"Badgering the witness\" is the proper objection for a lawyer who is antagonizing or mocking a witness by asking insulting or derisive questions, perhaps in an attempt to provoke an emotional response.\n\nA lawyer on direct examination asks his witness, a layperson with no legal training, \"So John Doe was driving negligently?\" Opposing counsel could raise an argumentative objection. In this context, \"negligently\" is a legal term of art with a precise and narrow meaning, and the witness cannot reasonably answer the question without understanding the relevant law. Since the lawyer is \"arguing\" his case that John Doe was driving negligently through the witness, the objection would be sustained and the improper statements stricken from the record.\n\nIn this example, however, the lawyer conducting the direct examination may have an opportunity to rephrase his question. If the judge sustains the argumentative objection, the lawyer may instead ask questions such as \"was John Doe exceeding the posted speed limit?\", \"was John Doe making lane changes without proper signals?\", \"how did Mr. Doe respond to your comments about his driving,\" or \"Did you feel unsafe when you were a passenger in the car driven by John Doe?\"\n\nSuch questions may be permitted and require no legal expertise for a layperson to answer, thus allowing the lawyer to introduce testimony about John Doe's driving habits without specifically using the legal term \"negligence\".\n\n"}

In a piece in which the original material or melody is referred to as the \"A\" section, the bridge may be the third eight-bar phrase in a thirty-two-bar form (the B in AABA), or may be used more loosely in verse-chorus form, or, in a compound AABA form, used as a contrast to a full AABA section.\n\nThe term comes from a German word for bridge, \"Steg\", used by the Meistersingers of the 15th to the 18th century to describe a transitional section in medieval bar form. The German term became widely known in 1920s Germany through musicologist Alfred Lorenz and his exhaustive studies of Richard Wagner's adaptations of bar form in his popular 19th-century neo-medieval operas. The term entered the English lexicon in the 1930s—translated as \"bridge\"—via composers fleeing Nazi Germany who, working in Hollywood and on Broadway, used the term to describe similar transitional sections in the American popular music they were writing.\n\nThe bridge is often used to contrast with and prepare for the return of the verse and the chorus. \"The b section of the popular song chorus is often called the \"bridge\" or \"release\".\" For example, the B of AABA in thirty-two-bar form, with the verse surrounding the whole. While the bridge in verse-chorus and other forms is C, for example: ABABCAB. Lyrically, the bridge is typically used to pause and reflect on the earlier portions of the song or to prepare the listener for the climax. The term may also refer to the section between the verse and the chorus, though this is more commonly called the \"pre-chorus\" or \"link\". The lyrics of the theme, \"The Song That Goes Like This\", from the musical play \"Spamalot\" spoofs the abuse of the bridge in romantic songwriting: \"Now we can go straight / into the middle eight / a bridge that is too far for me\". Similarly, in the \"Axis of Awesome\" song \"This Is How You Write a Love Song\", the lyrics humorously map the movement of the song from chorus to chorus using bridges. In the song \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\", James Brown asks if he can \"take the band to the bridge\". Led Zeppelin makes an in-joke regarding the use of bridges in popular music in their song \"The Crunge\", asking, at the end, \"Where's the confounded bridge?\" The song, humorously, does not have a bridge.\n\nBridges are also common in classical music, and are known as a specific Sequence form—also known as transitions. Formally called a bridge-passage, they delineate separate sections of an extended work, or smooth what would otherwise be an abrupt modulation, such as the transition between the two themes of a sonata form. In the latter context, this transition between two musical subjects is often referred to as the \"transition theme\"; indeed, in later Romantic symphonies such as Dvořák's New World Symphony or César Franck's Symphony in D minor, the transition theme becomes almost a third subject in itself.\n\nThe latter work also provides several good examples of a short bridge to smooth a modulation. Instead of simply repeating the whole exposition in the original key, as would be done in a symphony of the classical period, Franck repeats the first subject a minor third higher in F minor. A two-bar bridge achieves this transition with Frank's characteristic combination of enharmonic and chromatic modulation. After the repeat of the first subject, another bridge of four bars leads into the transition theme in F major, the key of the true second subject. \n\nIn a fugue, a bridge is, \"...a short passage at the end of the first entrance of the answer and the beginning of the second entrance of the subject. Its purpose is to modulate back to the tonic key (subject) from the answer (which is in the dominant key). Not all fugues include a bridge.\"\n\nAn example of a bridge-passage that separates two sections of a more loosely organized work occurs in George Gershwin's \"An American in Paris\". As Deems Taylor described it in the program notes for the first performance: \"Having safely eluded the taxis ... the American's itinerary becomes somewhat obscured. ... However, since what immediately ensues is technically known as a bridge-passage, one is reasonably justified in assuming that the Gershwin pen ... has perpetrated a musical pun and that ... our American has crossed the Seine, and is somewhere on the Left Bank.\"\n\n\n"}

Early 20th century operas of this type include Paul Hindemith's \"Cardillac\" (1926). Earlier small-scale operas such as Pergolesi's \"La serva padrona\" (1733) are sometimes known as chamber operas. \n\nOther 20th century examples include Gustav Holst's \"Savitri\" (1916). Benjamin Britten wrote works in this category in the 1940s when the English Opera Group needed works that could easily be taken on tour and performed in a variety of small performance spaces. \"The Rape of Lucretia\" (1946) was his first example in the genre, and Britten followed it with \"Albert Herring\" (1947), \"The Turn of the Screw\" (1954) and \"Curlew River\" (1964). Other composers, including Hans Werner Henze, Harrison Birtwistle, Thomas Adès, George Benjamin, William Walton, and Philip Glass have written in this genre.\n\nInstrumentation for chamber operas vary: Britten scored \"The Rape of Lucretia\" for eight singers with single strings and wind with piano, harp and percussion. Humphrey Searle's \"The Diary of a Madman\" (1958) is scored for four voices and an orchestra of single strings, woodwind and brass, with two percussionists.

Cuneiform would be applied in the recording of the Akkadian language and several other languages of Mesopotamia as the usage of Sumerian began to fade as a spoken language.\n\nAs both Mesopotamians and Egyptians began to regard writing as an indicator of one's privilege/rank in societal hierarchy, instructors of the times were given rein to develop drilling (reading/identification, and so on) and memorisation techniques still in operation in modern language instruction. This may have also been assisted by the eventual availability of papyrus as well as the evolution of the hieroglyphs into the more comprehensible forms of Hieratic (from the Greek 'hieros' meaning 'sacred' and coined by Herodotus (c. 484-424 BCE)) and Demotic. These would diminish one another in their own swiftness and would be key elements in the deciphering of the Rosetta Stone by Jean-François Champollion.\n\nWhile it is thought that the Phoenician alphabet is the first veritable alphabet, it contained only consonants (an abjad). Upon reaching the shores of Greece via sailing merchants, it is proposed that the Greek alphabet was developed by a combination of the Phoenician form and the Egyptian Demotic. Although it would fall out of common usage in or around 1100 BCE (except for, or almost exclusively in the university/scholarly realm, as well as in its mother country), its presence would be felt in more modern languages such as Latin and later English.\n\nAs a great number of Biblical texts were transcribed in Aramaic (arising in Aram (modern day Syria) in or near 800 BCE), along with the rising popularity of the Gospels, teachings of both the language and theological aspects therein became more prevalent in society. This would be furthered by the eventual translations of the Aramaic into Hebrew and/or Yiddish which began to flourish in the Arabic peninsula and the surrounding areas along with the established language found in Qur'anic texts. And although there are spotty connections with their Phoenician systems, it is clear that the transcription of the 'scriptures' mentioned into dialects still spoken, to some degree, today allowed for written as well as verbal language to reach a larger portion of the masses.\n\nThe intricate system of characters defined by their radicals (214 in the Chinese system, with an alternative 79 radical system in the later developed Japanese interpretation known as Kanji (漢字)) is believed to have come to use around 2000 BCE. It was furthermore codified about 1500 BCE and finally systemised between 200 BCE-400 CE. It is considered one of the most consistently unchanged systems of writing and is held in high regard in its influence of nearby languages. Its forms, when written, may range from bloc (the most visible form generally not using brushes) to semi- and fully cursive styles which require a certain degree of skill and devotion (through constant practice and memorisation) and remain in wide use.\n\nIn the words of Philip Hofer (1941, p. 2), in the latter portion of the 7th century 'English calligraphy became important and influential on the course of writing styles for the first time' (often credited in part to Alcuin of York). Eventually a form of English handwriting would form to follow the function of the daily business affairs of merchants, clerks and professional scribes for a more masterful and consistent means of correspondence. \n\nDuring the same period (around the 17th-18th centuries), as English trade came more to the forefront of mainland Europe and the \"New World\", a significant amount of copy books came about which made use of the finery of English script of the time. In some time a more common system of joined/cursive handwriting would be developed for usage in the same vein along with its promotion in the education system.\n\n\nAlthough, to a certain degree, modern widespread and efficient means of printing coupled with computer technology have pushed stylistic and complex handwriting techniques to the backdrop of linguistic aspects, the aforementioned practices remain in use often in the fields of academia for study. Calligraphy remains a commonplace facet of many modern East Asian languages as well as forms of cursive Arabic. However dated they may seem, they are necessary in order to grasp archaic or other older forms of current languages in the field of linguistics, as there are still mysteries to resolve (such as the near indecipherable Indus Script).\n\n\n\n"}

Encumbrances can be classified in several ways. They may be financial (for example, liens) or non-financial (for example, easements, private restrictions). Alternatively, they may be divided into those that affect title (for example, lien, legal or equitable charge) or those that affect the use or physical condition of the encumbered property (for example, restrictions, easements, encroachments). Encumbrances include security interests, liens, servitudes (for example, easements, wayleaves, real covenants, profits a prendre), leases, restrictions, encroachments, and air and subsurface rights. Also, those considered as potentially making the title defeasible are encumbrances, for example, charging orders, building orders and structure alteration. Encumbrance: charge upon or claim against land arising out of private grant or a contract.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there is statutory definition of \"encumbrance\". In Conveyancing and Property Ordinance (Cap. 219) it reads: \"\"\"encumbrance\" (產權負擔) includes a legal and equitable mortgage, a trust for securing money, a lien, a charge of a portion, annuity, or other capital or annual sum; and \"encumbrancer\" (產權負擔人) has a meaning corresponding with that of \"encumbrance\" and includes every person entitled to the benefit of an encumbrance, or to require payment and discharge thereof\"\".\n\nIt is also a term used by colleges and universities to describe limitations placed on a student's account due to late payment, late registration, or other reasons stated by the institution. An encumbrance can prohibit students from registering for classes, affect the release of their transcripts, or delay the reception of their diplomas.\n\nIn management accounting, \"encumbrance\" is a management tool used to reflect commitments in the accounting system and attempt to prevent overspending. Encumbrances allow organizations to recognize future commitments of resources prior to an actual expenditure. \n"}

It explains what is being commemorated on what date, and generally also includes an illustration page.\n\nIdeally, the stamps used relate to the celebration (for instance, space stamps for a shuttle launch). Cancels are either obtained in the city of the event (such as Kitty Hawk for the Wright Brothers first flight anniversary) or, for larger quantities of envelopes, from a special cancellation unit maintained by the Postal Service in Kansas City, Missouri. If a special cancellation (one with a design) has been created for the event, you can generally only receive that cancel from the local post office.\nA good example of a special Event cover was one by the Isle of Man Philatelic Bureau that was issued in 1985 to mark the anniversary of the aircraft Douglas DC-3, which was of interest, not only because of the high volume of air mail handled by Dakotas at that time, but also the link between the names of Douglas, Isle of Man, and Dakota - Douglas DC3. A 26p stamp was specially issued by the Isle of Man and a special handstamp was also created for these covers, which was deliberately created with a Dakota flying \"free\" and not boxed in. The envelope was also officially acknowledged by the McDonnell Douglas company and bore their official DC3 logo in the bottom right of the Envelope.\n\nThe earliest recognized event covers were presidential inauguration covers, which were first created in the early part of the 20th century (the stamp hobby calls envelopes \"covers\" because letters were originally simply wrapped in a blank piece of paper, or \"cover\"). Event cover creation and collecting is considered part of the first day cover hobby, which creates decorated covers to commemorate the issuance of stamps. Both fields are recognized by the principal cover collecting organization, the American First Day Cover Society, which includes an event cover category in its annual cachet-maker's contest and an event cover column in its journal, \"First Days\".\n\nEvent covers can include mail that was aboard aircraft that flew the mail between two points, usually large cities, for the first time, however these covers are usually referred to as First flight covers by collectors.\n\n"}

Hunter Skott, who has worked as one, contended in an interview that they \"are only used for a gangbang or bukkake, not for regular [porn] movies\". Sloane Steel, formerly of Bangbros.com, said much the same.\n\nIn the 1998 video game \"Fallout 2\", it is possible for the player to become a fluffer for a post-apocalyptic studio engaged in the porn industry.\n\nThe 2001 film \"The Fluffer\" is about a film buff with a crush on a porn star who is straight, for whom he would end up working as a fluffer in gay porn. A four-minute short comedy film also titled \"The Fluffer\" was released in 2003.\n\nIn the 2003 fourth episode of the TV series \"Nip/Tuck\", Matt McNamara's one-night stand with a pornographic \"fluffer\" (played by Marnette Patterson) results in a sexually transmitted infection scare.\nIn an episode of \"New Girl\" entitled \"Fluffer\", a male character is described as an \"emotional fluffer\" for the female lead, providing her sentimental stimulation which allows her to maintain a more active sex life with a different man with whom she has been having sex.\n\nThe term \"fluffer\" has also been adopted by the real estate industry to refer to a person that stages homes, and as a term for a maid who fluffs pillows, or in general cleans and prepares work equipment. These two usages of the term predate the pornographic usage, which came into use in the 1970s.\n\n"}

His work has been applied in automatic language-understanding software, and in writing-skills training. He has also analysed Ronald Coase's \"theory of the firm\" and the economic and political implications of e-business.\n\nSampson is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, the British Computer Society and the Higher Education Academy.\nHe is also a Chartered Information Technology Professional. He holds three MA degrees, one each from Cambridge, Yale and Oxford (by incorporation). Sampson attended Bristol Grammar School, matriculating to study Oriental Studies at St John's College, Cambridge. After graduating from St. John's he went on to Yale, conducting research in the Linguistics and Engineering & Applied Science departments. He was awarded a doctorate by Cambridge under the special regulations; his published work was deemed to comprise \"a significant contribution to scholarship\".\n\nHis academic career has included work in Oriental languages, linguistics and computing, with side interests in philosophy, and political and economic thought. He lectured at the London School of Economics, the University of Lancaster and the University of Leeds before moving to Sussex in 1991.\n\nSampson is widely known for academic papers criticising the linguistic nativist movement, including the arguments of proponents such as Noam Chomsky, Jerry Fodor and Steven Pinker. Sampson critically engaged with Pinker's 1994 book \"The Language Instinct\", in his own book \"The 'Language Instinct' Debate\", the first edition of which, published in 1997, was entitled \"Educating Eve\". To date, Pinker has not published responses to the criticisms.\n\nSampson is cited twice as an authority on writing systems in \"Encyclopædia Britannica\".\n\nSampson describes himself as a politically active man. He was elected to Wealden District Council in 2001, serving until 2002 with the local Conservative Party branch. He resigned this position after he was criticized by Labour Party and Liberal Democrat ministers and councillors for publishing on his website an article, \"There's Nothing Wrong With Racism (Except the Name)\", containing a number of racist claims. The outcome was subsequently endorsed by Conservative Central Office as \"in the best interests of all concerned ...the Conservative party is opposed to all forms of racial discrimination\". Some time later he left the Conservative Party and in 2006 joined the United Kingdom Independence Party.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "66443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66443", "title": "Kleptocracy", "text": "Kleptocracy\n\nKleptocracy (from Greek κλέπτης \"kléptēs\", \"thief\", κλέπτω \"kléptō\", \"I steal\", and -κρατία -\"kratía\" from κράτος \"krátos\", \"power, rule\") is a government with corrupt leaders (kleptocrats) that use their power to exploit the people and natural resources of their own territory in order to extend their personal wealth and political powers. Typically, this system involves embezzlement of funds at the expense of the wider population.\n\nKleptocracy is different from a plutocracy; A kleptocracy is a government ruled by corrupt politicians who use their political power to receive kickbacks, bribes, and special favors at the expense of the populace. Kleptocrats may use political leverage to pass laws that enrich them or their constituents and they usually circumvent the rule of law.\n\nKleptocracies are generally associated with dictatorships, oligarchies, military juntas, or other forms of autocratic and nepotist governments in which external oversight is impossible or does not exist. This lack of oversight can be caused or exacerbated by the ability of the kleptocratic officials to control both the supply of public funds and the means of disbursal for those funds. Kleptocratic rulers often treat their country's treasury as a source of personal wealth, spending funds on luxury goods and extravagances as they see fit. Many kleptocratic rulers secretly transfer public funds into hidden personal numbered bank accounts in foreign countries to provide for themselves if removed from power.\n\nKleptocracy is most common in developing countries whose economies are based on the export of natural resources. Such export incomes constitute a form of economic rent and are easier to siphon off without causing the income to decrease.\n\nA specific case of kleptocracy is \"Raubwirtschaft\", German for \"plunder economy\" or \"rapine economy\", where the whole economy of the state is based on robbery, looting and plundering the conquered territories. Such states are either in continuous warfare with their neighbours or they simply milk their subjects as long as they have any taxable assets. Arnold Toynbee has claimed the Roman Empire was a \"Raubwirtschaft.\"\n\nContemporary studies have identified 21st century kleptocracy as a global financial system based on money laundering (which the International Monetary Fund has estimated comprises 2-5 percent of the global economy).\n\nKleptocrats engage in money laundering to obscure the corrupt origins of their wealth and safeguard it from domestic threats such as economic instability and predatory kleptocratic rivals. They are then able to secure this wealth in assets and investments within more stable jurisdictions, where it can then be stored for personal use, returned to the country of origin to support the kleptocrat's domestic activities, or deployed elsewhere to protect and project the regime's interests overseas.\n\nIllicit funds are typically transferred out of a kleptocracy into Western jurisdictions for money laundering and asset security. Since 2011, more than $1 trillion has left developing countries annually in illicit financial outflows. A 2016 study found that $12 trillion had been siphoned out of Russia, China, and developing economies.\n\nWestern professional services providers are an essential part of the kleptocratic financial system, exploiting legal and financial loopholes in their own jurisdictions to facilitate transnational money laundering. The kleptocratic financial system typically comprises four steps.\n\nFirst, kleptocrats or those operating on their behalf create anonymous shell companies to conceal the origins and ownership of the funds. Multiple interlocking networks of anonymous shell companies may be created and nominee directors appointed to further conceal the kleptocrat as the ultimate beneficial owner of the funds.\n\nSecond, a kleptocrat's funds are transferred into the Western financial system via accounts which are subject to weak or nonexistent anti-money laundering procedures.\n\nThird, financial transactions conducted by the kleptocrat in a Western country complete the integration of the funds. Once a kleptocrat has purchased an asset this can then be resold, providing a legally defensible origin of the funds. Research has shown the purchase of luxury real estate to be a particularly favored method.\n\nFourth, kleptocrats may use their laundered funds to engage in reputation laundering, hiring public relations firms to present a positive public image and lawyers to suppress journalistic scrutiny of their political connections and origins of their wealth.\n\nThe United States is international kleptocrats' favoured jurisdiction for laundering money. In a 2011 forensic study of grand corruption cases, the World Bank found the United States was the leading jurisdiction of incorporation for entities involved in money laundering schemes. The Department of Treasury estimates that $300 billion is laundered annually in the United States.\n\nThis kleptocratic financial system flourishes in the United States for three reasons. First, the absence of a beneficial ownership registry means that it is the easiest country in the world in which to conceal the ownership of a company. The United States produces more than 2 million corporate entities a year, and 10 times more shell companies than 41 other countries identified as tax havens combined. It currently takes more information to obtain a library card than to form a US company.\n\nSecond, some of the professions most at risk of being exploited for money laundering by kleptocrats are not required to perform due diligence on prospective customers, including incorporation agents, lawyers, and realtors. A 2012 undercover study found that just 10 of 1,722 U.S. incorporation agents refused to create an anonymous company for a suspicious customer; a 2016 investigation found that just one of 13 prominent New York law firms refused to provide advice for a suspicious customer.\n\nThird, such anonymous companies can then freely engage in transactions without having to reveal their beneficial owner.\n\nCurrently, there are only around 1,200 money laundering convictions per year in the United States and money launderers face a less than five percent chance of conviction. Raymond Baker estimates that law enforcement fails in 99.9% of cases to detect money laundering by kleptocrats and other financial criminals.\n\nOther Western jurisdictions favoured by kleptocrats include the United Kingdom and its dependencies, especially the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey and Jersey. Jurisdictions in the European Union which are particularly favoured by kleptocrats include Cyprus, the Netherlands, and its dependency the Dutch Antilles.\n\nThe effects of a kleptocratic regime or government on a nation are typically adverse in regards to the welfare of the state's economy, political affairs, and civil rights. Kleptocratic governance typically ruins prospects of foreign investment and drastically weakens the domestic market and cross-border trade. As kleptocracies often embezzle money from their citizens by misusing funds derived from tax payments, or engage heavily in money laundering schemes, they tend to heavily degrade quality of life for citizens.\n\nIn addition, the money that kleptocrats steal is diverted from funds earmarked for public amenities such as the building of hospitals, schools, roads, parks – having further adverse effects on the quality of life of citizens. The informal oligarchy that results from a kleptocratic elite subverts democracy (or any other political format).\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the first use in English occurs in the publication \"Indicator\" of 1819: “Titular ornaments, common to Spanish kleptocracy.”\n\nAccording to at least one commentator, parasitism may be the new social paradigm involving class warfare and exploitation of electoral processes of myriad and disparate countries around the world. See Oligarchy and Elite capture.\n\nIn early 2004, the German anti-corruption NGO Transparency International released a list of what it believes to be the ten most self-enriching leaders in the past two decades.\nIn order of amount allegedly stolen USD, they were:\n\nThe Russian president Vladimir Putin is alleged to be the \"head of the clan\", whose assets are estimated at over $200 billion. A list of Russian and Ukrainian politicians associated with \"kleptocratic style\" has been published by the Kleptocracy Archives project.\n\nSources have also alleged that former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stole up to $70 billion.\n\nIn addition, other sources have listed former PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat as having stolen $1 billion to $10 billion; and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari to have received kickbacks on contracts and misappropriating public funds, siphoning over $2 billion to his Swiss accounts.\n\nThe former Chairman of BTA Bank Mukhtar Ablyasov is alleged to have embezzled more than $6 billion from his bank committing the largest financial fraud in history.\n\nIn May 2017, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace released a report detailing what it called a kleptocratic network across the government and private sector in Honduras.\n\nNursultan Nazarbayev is a head of the Kazakhstan ruling clan with $7 billion assets.\n\nChina's former prime minister, Wen Jiabao, left office in 2013 with his close relatives controlling assets worth at least $2.7 billion. These revelations were censored in print and censored online in China.\n\nFormer Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Abdul Razak had $731 million when his ruling-party alliance Barisan Nasional lost the 14th election to opposition party Pakatan Harapan led by former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, in part because of 1MDB scandal and various other corruption scandals. (national debt of $250 billion) \n\nThe term kleptocracy was also used to refer to the Russian economy, soon after the Soviet collapse in 1991. The \"democrats\", led by Yegor Gaidar and Anatoly Chubais, freed prices in 1992 and unleashed hyperinflation before they privatized Russia's assets. Most Russian citizens lost their savings in only a few weeks. A few billionaire \"oligarchs\" amassed fortunes not by creating new enterprises, but by arbitraging the huge difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market. Instead of investing in the Russian economy, they stashed billions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts. Experts estimate that as much as $15 billion left Russia each year as either capital flight or laundered money from illegal transactions. Referring to Russia, Daniel Kimmage also used the terms: \"kerdocracy\" (\"rule based on the desire for material gain\") or \"khrematisamenocracy\" (\"rule by those who transact business for their own profit\").>\nThe republic of South Africa is presently embroiled in \" state capture\"\n\nA narcokleptocracy is a society in which criminals involved in the trade of narcotics have undue influence in the governance of a state. For instance, the term was used to describe the regime of Manuel Noriega in Panama in a report prepared by a subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Committee chaired by Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. The term narcostate has the same meaning.\n\n"}

He is the host of \"The Savage Nation\", a nationally syndicated talk show that aired on Talk Radio Network across the United States until 2012, and in 2009 was the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States. Since October 23, 2012, Michael Savage has been syndicated by Cumulus Media Networks. He holds master's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathy; as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached \"The New York Times Best Seller list\".\n\nSavage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative nationalism, while critics have characterized them as \"fostering extremism.\" He supports the English-only movement and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.\n\nSince 2009, Savage has been barred from entering the United Kingdom for \"seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred.\" \n\nSavage was born Michael Alan Weiner in the Bronx, New York, one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner, Jewish emigrants from Russia. He described his childhood as difficult. His little brother, Jerome, was born with developmental disabilities and was unable to hear or speak. Jerome died in 1969. His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57 in 1970, and his mother died in 2003.\n\nAfter graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958, Savage attended Queens College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963. After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD. Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972. He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine. His thesis was titled \"Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji\".\n\nSavage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco in the 1970s. He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and three postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University. One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could \"hear and see and know why I adore your public image.\" Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.\n\nAcquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views. Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends. When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, \"I was once a child; I am now a man.\" Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker. He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes. Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as \"political opposition\" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, \"Immigrants and Epidemics\", was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory. In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative. Savage later dropped the lawsuit.\n\nThe rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host. On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was \"To the right of Rush and to the left of God.\" On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours on sister station KSFO. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.\n\nIn mid 2006, Savage had 8–10 million listeners per week, which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as \"literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy.\" He has described his show's production as one with a \"... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein.\" Mark de la Viña of the \"San Jose Mercury News\" wrote of Savage: \"In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab.\"\n\nBy 2009, \"The Savage Nation\" had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time. Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New Yorker\"; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the \"New Yorker\" profile, titled \"Party of One\", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.\n\nOn September 10, 2009, KNEW-AM (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM (640 kHz)/Los Angeles. John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed \"... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information.\" According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW-AM dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.\n\nOn January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for \"Playboy\" had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the \"Playboy\" writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the \"Savage Nation\" but a critic of the profile done by \"The New Yorker\". The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to \"rattle\" \"Playboy\"s readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. \"Playboy\" published the interview in June 2010. He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word \"Playboy\" interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the \"New Yorker\" interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a \"real writer\" who had understood his subject.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way. Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012. By April 2013, according to the radio industry's \"Talkers Magazine\", Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners. On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, \"The Savage Nation\", would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for \"The Savage Nation\".\n\nSavage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book \"The Savage Nation\" and the objections of NBC employees including news anchor Tom Brokaw, who asked NBC executives, \"Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?\" Sorenson, at the time, called Savage \"brash, passionate and smart,\" and promised that he would provide \"compelling opinion and analysis with an edge.\"\n\nFour months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a \"sodomite\", to which the caller answered, \"Yes, I am.\" Savage then said to the caller,\n\nThe day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.\n\nMichael Savage calls himself an \"independent-minded individualist\" and says that he \"fits no stereotype.\" He has also cited Barry Goldwater as an influence. Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias. He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society. He is a strong advocate of wildlife preservation, and has privately urged President Trump to support conservation in meetings at Mar-a-Lago. This followed a series of pleas on his radio show for the President to support legislation that protected wildlife.\n\nSavage describes the European Union as \"Hitler's dream of a united Europe under German control.\" He equates Britain's vote to leave the Union with the Second World War, saying it was \"in many ways the Battle of Britain all over again.\" Savage foresees that, after Brexit, the E.U. risks igniting a civil war to gain total control of the population for their plans of \"a new Soviet-style superstate, which have been long on the drawing books.\"\n\nIn 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush \"quite reluctantly, incidentally.\" In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush. Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election.\n\nSavage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election. Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.\n\nSavage subscribes to the white genocide conspiracy theory, a white nationalist belief, which claims that white people are becoming extinct through forced assimilation or violent genocide. Savage blames Barack Obama and the Democratic Party for promoting the concept within the United States. He has claimed there is a \"cultural genocide being promulgated against Caucasians\".\n\nSavage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the U.S. Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton. Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of \"Healing Children Naturally\" and \"Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's\" purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund.\nThe Marines were ultimately found not guilty.\n\nOn June 9, 2007, \"Talkers Magazine\" awarded Savage with the publication's annual \"Freedom of Speech Award,\" and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech.\n\nNational Radio Hall of Fame\n\nIn July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book \"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America\". Goldberg wrote that \"Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left.\" David Klinghoffer, a \"National Review\" columnist, speculated that \"The Savage Nation\" \"is an act, a put-on.\" Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.\n\nOn April 17, 2006, Savage was seriously criticized worldwide after he said on the topic of Muslims, \"They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die—would you rather us die than them?\" This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.\n\nIn the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an \"aggressive act\" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism,\n\nIn March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it \"pastoral support\"). Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying \"what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.\n\nOn March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to counter pro-immigration rallies in California.\n\nWhen \"Talkers Magazine\" awarded Savage with the publication's annual \"Freedom of Speech Award,\" C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage. Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.\n\nIn early November 2007, the Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims \"need deportation\", and that adherents of Islam would do well to \"take your religion and shove it up your behind\" because \"I'm sick of you.\" On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.\n\nOn November 5, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show.\n\nSavage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website. The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was \"deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage\". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as \"a throwback document\" and a \"book of hate\". CAIR called the suit \"bizarre, sloppy and baseless\". On July 25, 2008, United States district court Judge Susan Illston dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under fair use. The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case. CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage, Judge Illston denied that request.\n\nIn July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of \"a racket\" designed to get disability payments for \"poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government.\" He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:\n\nIn July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children. WOR issued a statement saying, \"We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners.\" Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising, and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with \"The Dennis Miller Show\". Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been \"ripped out of context\" by \"far left Stalinists\" who want him off of the air. He appeared on \"Larry King Live\" with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits. On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, The Home Depot, and DirectBuy, will discontinue their support for Savage's show.\n\nSavage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.\n\nOn May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that Savage was on a list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is \"considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence\". During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a \"lunatic\".\n\nDuring a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, \"No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing\". Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, \"If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball.\" When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a \"foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!\" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.\n\nOf the banning, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote:\n\"America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight.\"\nIn \"The Guardian\", Catherine Bennett wrote: \"The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation.\" While Sam Leith wrote: \"Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech.\"\n\nOn October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of posttraumatic stress disorder, accusing them of \"weakness\". According to Savage, \"Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military.\"\n\nWhile in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji. That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage.\n\nSavage and his second wife, Janet, have two children, a daughter and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink. Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009. In 1974, Savage and his family moved to Fairfax, California after Savage completed his master's degree at the University of Hawaii. Savage has homes in Larkspur and Tiburon in Marin County, California, an apartment in San Francisco, as well as residences in Beverly Hills, California and West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Jewish Synagogue Chabad house in Berkeley. In a 2003 interview on \"The O'Reilly Factor\", Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year. In his 2012 book \"Trickle Down Tyranny\", Savage wrote: \"... I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.\"\n\nSavage is noted as a supporter of wildlife conservation efforts, speaking out against the poaching of elephants in Africa. He has pleaded on his show and called upon President Donald J. Trump to reinstate a ban on the importation of elephant trophies.\n\nSavage has had many pet dogs throughout his life, his current one being Teddy, a toy poodle.\n\nSavage has met with President Trump on numerous occasions and was formally invited to the White House to meet with the President and Vice President Mike Pence. He had not been in Washington D.C. for three decades prior this visit.\n\nIn total, Savage has written 40 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 \"New York Times\" Best Sellers and three additional books which made \"The New York Times Best Seller list\". have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.\n\nHis earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and HIV/AIDS. He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.\n\nHis more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.\n\nIn 1991, Savage self-published \"The Death of the White Male\", an argument against affirmative action, through Quantum Books. In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action \"reverse discrimination\", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.\n\nIn January 2003, Savage published \"The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture\", his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of \"The New York Times Best Seller list]\", earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at \"liberal media bias\", the \"dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'\", gay activists, and liberals.\n\nIn January 2004, Savage published his second political book \"The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military\". His next book, \"Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder\", was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike \"The Savage Nation\", both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.\n\nIn April 2006, Savage released \"The Political Zoo\". The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, depicted in caricature as animals in the \"Political Zoo\", with Savage portrayed as the zoo keeper.\n\nIn October 2010, Savage released \"Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security\". Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that \"Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses.\"\n\nIn November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, \"Abuse of Power\", was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on \"My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know\", said Savage. It is set in San Francisco, mainly in North Beach, as well as London, and Tel Aviv. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as \"the Hand of Allah\". The publisher has described the novel by saying, \"will make 9/11 look like child's play\".\n\nIn 2014, Savage released \"Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth\", in which Savage writes in part, \"We are under assault from both inside and out as our government moves to consolidate its domestic power, while at the same time weakening our defenses against the growing power of our enemies.\"\n\nIn 2015, Savage released another New York Times Best Seller titled \"Government Zero: No Borders, No Language, No Culture.\" It tells of how the country has been left without the founding principles of his radio show, \"borders, language and culture,\" and the destruction the Obama Presidency brought to the country. Savage offered several solutions as to how to rebuild the nation.\n\nIn 2016 Savage released \"Scorched Earth: Restoring The Country After Obama\". This New York Times best seller was a blueprint for how then candidate Donald Trump could help get the country back on the right track should he win the election.\n\nIn March 2017, Savage released what he said would be his last political book, \"Trump's War: His Battle For America\". The book debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller List.\n\nIn November 2017 Dr. Savage released a non-political book based on his lifelong quest for spiritual truth titled, \"God, Faith, and Reason.\" \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8156749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8156749", "title": "National Thanksgiving Proclamation", "text": "National Thanksgiving Proclamation\n\nThe National Thanksgiving Proclamation was the first formal proclamation of Thanksgiving in the United States. President George Washington declared Thursday, November 26, 1789 as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.\n\nSetting aside time to give thanks for one's blessings, along with holding feasts to celebrate a harvest, are both practices that long predate the European settlement of North America. The first documented thanksgiving services in territory currently belonging to the United States were conducted by Spaniards and the French in the 16th century. Thanksgiving services were routine in what became the Commonwealth of Virginia as early as 1607, with the first permanent settlement of Jamestown, Virginia holding a thanksgiving in 1610. In 1619, the Berkeley Hundred colony held a service on December 4, 1619, to celebrate “the day of our ship’s arrival” and proclaimed the date would be “yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of thanksgiving to the Almighty God.” The colony was wiped out shortly after, in March 1722, with some inhabitants being massacred, and the rest fleeing. The generally referenced 'First Thanksgiving' occurred on Plymouth Colony, shortly after the colonists first successful harvest in autumn of 1621. They celebrated for three straight dayswith their Native American neighbors with whom they had signed a mutual protection treaty the Spring before. \n\nIn 1723, Massachusetts Bay Governor William Dummer proclaimed a day of thanksgiving on November 6. The first proclamation in the independent United States was issued by John Hancock as President of the Continental Congress as a day of fasting on March 16, 1776. The first national Thanksgiving was celebrated on December 18, 1777, and the Continental Congress issued National Thanksgiving Day proclamations each year between 1778 and 1784. There were no national thanksgiving day proclamations from 1785 to 1788.\n\nIn Congress, Elias Boudinot introduced a resolution to create a joint committee to \"wait on the President of the United States, to request that he would recommend to the people a day of public prayer and thanksgiving,\"\n\nThe resolution was opposed by Anti-Federalists, who opposed increased power of the central government. Chief among the opposition were Aedanus Burke, and Thomas Tudor Tucker. Burke was of the opinion that the holiday was too \"European.\" He \"did not like this mimicking of European customs, where they made a mere mockery of thanksgivings.\" Burke was referencing the fact that at thanksgivings, both sides of a war often sang Te Deum, a hymn of praise. He was objecting that both the winners and losers in a war gave thanksgiving. Tucker however, felt that the federal government did not have the power to propose a day of thanksgiving. He was of the opinion that \"If a day of thanksgiving must take place, let it be done by the authority of the States.\" Tucker also worried about the separation of church and state, as in his opinion, proclaiming a day of thanksgiving was a religious matter.\n\nIn the end, the resolution passed the House and the Senate, and a committee of Elias Boudinot, Roger Sherman, Peter Silvester, William Samuel Johnson, and Ralph Izard delivered the message to Washington on or before September 28, 1789. President Washington noted that \"both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested [him] 'to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanks-giving and prayer.'\" It was formally declared on November 26 to \"be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.\" President George Washington made this proclamation on October 3, 1789 in New York City.\n\nOn the day of thanksgiving, Washington attended services at St. Paul's Chapel in New York City, and donated beer and food to imprisoned debtors in the city.\n\nGeorge Washington proclaimed a second day of Thanksgiving in 1795, following the defeat of the Whiskey Rebellion. After Washington left office, John Adams, James Madison, and others intermediately declared days of Thanksgiving. Several presidents opposed days of national thanksgiving, with Thomas Jefferson openly denouncing such a proclamation. By 1855, 16 states celebrated Thanksgiving (14 on the fourth Thursday of November, and two on the third). However, it was not until 1863 that Abraham Lincoln established the regular tradition of observing days of national thanksgiving.\n\n"}
{"id": "4796857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4796857", "title": "Nukuoro language", "text": "Nukuoro language\n\nThe Nukuoro language is a Polynesian language, spoken by about 860 people on the Nukuoro atoll and on Pohnpei in Micronesia.\n\nNukuoro is a coral atoll and Polynesian outlier found within the Pohnpei District within the Federated States of Micronesia. Despite the fact that Nukuoro is a Micronesian atoll, from a typological perspective, Nukuoro is a Polynesian language that descends from the Austronesian node. Its most immediate node is the Elliciean node. This language is most closely related to Kapingamarangi, Rennellese, and Vaeakau-Taumako sporting lexical similarity (Carroll 1965). These languages are not mutually intelligible, but they can make themselves understand each other with a little bit of difficulty. Bilingualism is not a common feature among the Nukuoro people, although the majority of the older Nukuoro population have a considerable amount of knowledge in Ponapean, sometimes know some German, Japanese, English, or another Micronesian language. This second language is usually reserved for the classroom, Bible reading, conversation with visitors, etc.\n\nNukuoro was colonized multiple times, by Germany, Japan, and then also some by the United States of America in its lifetime. The history that local legend has it says that immigrants from another island first populated Nukuoro. Two canoes from Samoa under the leadership of Chief Ko Wave and his priestly father Teakhu lead this movement (Newton).\n\nThe primary language spoken on the Nukuoro atoll is Nukuoro. In 1965 there were approximately 400 speakers. 260 of these speakers resided on the atoll, 125 lived on Ponape, the District Center, and a few others were spread out on the other islands in the District (Carroll 1965). The current population is estimated to be at about 1000 speakers. The Nukuoro people are very dependent on the sea. They have a strong respect for the marine culture, and are very well known for their skillfully created wooden sculptures. These often are carved to represent marine animals.\n\nThere are 5 vowels in Nukuoro: /a, e, i, o, u/. There are also lengthened vowels, for example ‘’taane’’. Double vowels are represented by writing the vowel symbol twice. The phonemic geminate /aa/ is often realized phonetically as [æ]. \n\nThere are 10 consonants in Nukuoro.\n\nLike many Polynesian languages, Nukuoro has only three stops in its phonemic inventory: /p/, /t/, and /k/. These stops can be variably voiced, but are phonemically voiceless. The orthography of Nukuoro represents these voiceless stops with \"b, d, g\". The alveolar tap /ɾ/ is represented in Nukuoro orthography using the letter \"l\", although early records of Nukuoro (and in fact, the spelling of the language name itself) use \"r\". \n\nThere are also lengthened consonants, as in the word \"hhano\". Since singleton /p/, /t/, /k/ are written with \"b, d, g\", geminated /p/, /t/, /k/ are written with \"p, t, k\". Geminated /m/, /n/, /s/, /h/, /ɾ/ are represented with double letters (\"mm, nn, ss, hh, ll\"), and geminated /ŋ/ is written as \"nng\"..\n\nSyllables take the shapes V, VV, VVV, CV, CVV and CVVV. All possible V and VV combinations occur. All possible CV combinations occur except /vu/. The first member of a diphthong is always the syllabic peak when the syllable is stressed; elsewhere there is little difference between members, the peak of sonority tending to occur on the most naturally sonorous vowel (Carroll 1956).\n\nIn the Nukuoro language, each phoneme is distinct: “/b/ is an aspirated bilabial stop, /d/ is a lax aspirated dental stop, /g/ is a slightly aspirated of implosive velar stop, /v/ is a very lax labio-dental fricative, /s/ is a tense voiceless alveo-palatal fricative, /h/ is a voiceless velar fricative, /m/ is a voiced bilabial nasal, /n/ is a voiced dental nasal, /ng/ is a voiced velar nasal, /l/ is a voiced dental flap, /i/ is a high front unrounded vowel, /e/ is a mid front unrounded vowel, /a/ us a low or mid central unrounded vowel, /o/ is a mid back rounded vowel, and /u/ is a high back rounded vowel” (Carroll 1965). For double phonemes “stops have increased aspiration especially after pause, and articulation is tense and phones are normally voiceless; nasals and fricatives have tense articulation; flaps are tense, long, with pre-voiced dental stop; and vowels are about twice as long as single vowels and not rearticulated” (Carroll 1965).\n\nThe basic word order in Nukuoro is Subject-Object-Verb, but there are also cases of Verb-Subject-Object. \nAn example sentence: \"Au ne gidee de gaago\" \"I saw the chicken\"\n\nThere are four types of reduplication.\nR1 appears in nouns, adjectives, and verbs, while R2, R3 and R4 appear only in adjectives and verbs.\nR1 is reduplication of the entire base. So, for example, \"gohu\" \"dark\" and \"gohugohu\" means \"getting dark\".\nR2 is reduplication of the first syllable of a base. For example, \"gai\" means \"eat\" and \"gagai\" means \"the fish are biting\".\nR3 is reduplication of the initial consonant of a base. For example, \"seni\" means \"sleep\" and \"sseni\" means \"to sleep\".\nR4 is reduplication of the initial vowel of a base. For example, \"malemo\", which is a singular subject, and \"maalemo\", which is plural subject\n\nThere are few solid resources for the Nukuoro language. The primary and probably most informative one is Vern Carroll's book \"An Outline of the Structure of the Language of Nukuoro\". There is also a Nukuoro Lexicon that has English to Nukuoro and Nukuoro to English, as well as grammar notes.\n\nIn 2013, Gregory D.S. Anderson and K. David Harrison of Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages created the Nukuoro Talking Dictionary, a digital lexicon that includes sound recordings of Nukuoro words. This lexicon was initially populated with sound recordings from Nukuoro speakers Johnny Rudolph, Maynard Henry, and Kurt Erwin. This dictionary continues to be augmented by speakers and linguists and includes over 1000 audio tokens.\n\nNukuoro is listed as a developing language. Ethnologue states that this means it is in vigorous use but isn’t yet widespread. It is being transmitted to children, and is used in schools, government, and daily life. After World War 2 ended there were already efforts to help preserve the language as the United States set up an elementary school taught completely in Nukuoro. The population of speakers also increased from 400 to 1000 since 1965, which shows positive growth.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and emeritus professor at Princeton University. Since the 1960s, Kripke has been a central figure in a number of fields related to mathematical logic, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, metaphysics, epistemology, and set theory. Much of his work remains unpublished or exists only as tape recordings and privately circulated manuscripts. Kripke was the recipient of the 2001 Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy.\n\nKripke has made influential and original contributions to logic, especially modal logic. His work has profoundly influenced analytic philosophy; his principal contribution is a semantics for modal logic involving possible worlds, now called Kripke semantics. Another of his most important contributions is his argument that necessity is a \"metaphysical\" notion that should be separated from the epistemic notion of \"a priori\", and that there are necessary truths that are \"a posteriori\" truths, such as that water is HO. He has also contributed an original reading of Wittgenstein, referred to as \"Kripkenstein.\" A 1970 Princeton lecture series, published in book form 1980 as \"Naming and Necessity\", is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century.\n\nSaul Kripke is the oldest of three children born to Dorothy K. Kripke and Rabbi Myer S. Kripke. His father was the leader of Beth El Synagogue, the only Conservative congregation in Omaha, Nebraska; his mother wrote educational Jewish books for children. Saul and his two sisters, Madeline and Netta, attended Dundee Grade School and Omaha Central High School. Kripke was labeled a prodigy, teaching himself Ancient Hebrew by the age of six, reading Shakespeare's complete works by nine, and mastering the works of Descartes and complex mathematical problems before finishing elementary school. He wrote his first completeness theorem in modal logic at 17, and had it published a year later. After graduating from high school in 1958, Kripke attended Harvard University and graduated summa cum laude in 1962 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. During his sophomore year at Harvard, he taught a graduate-level logic course at nearby MIT. Upon graduation he received a Fulbright Fellowship, and in 1963 was appointed to the Society of Fellows. Kripke later said, \"I wish I could have skipped college. I got to know some interesting people but I can't say I learned anything. I probably would have learned it all anyway just reading on my own.\"\n\nAfter briefly teaching at Harvard, in 1968 Kripke moved to Rockefeller University in New York City, where he taught until 1976. In 1978 he took a chaired professorship at Princeton University. In 1988 he received the university's Behrman Award for distinguished achievement in the humanities. In 2002 Kripke began teaching at the CUNY Graduate Center, and in 2003 he was appointed a distinguished professor of philosophy there.\n\nKripke has received honorary degrees from the University of Nebraska, Omaha (1977), Johns Hopkins University (1997), University of Haifa, Israel (1998), and the University of Pennsylvania (2005). He is a member of the American Philosophical Society and an elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1985 was a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. He won the Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy in 2001.\n\nKripke was married to philosopher Margaret Gilbert. He is the second cousin once removed of television writer, director, and producer Eric Kripke.\n\nKripke's contributions to philosophy include:\n\n\nHe has also contributed to set theory (see admissible ordinal and Kripke–Platek set theory).\n\nTwo of Kripke's earlier works, \"A Completeness Theorem in Modal Logic\" and \"Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic,\" the former written when he was a teenager, were on modal logic. The most familiar logics in the modal family are constructed from a weak logic called K, named after Kripke. Kripke introduced the now-standard Kripke semantics (also known as relational semantics or frame semantics) for modal logics. Kripke semantics is a formal semantics for non-classical logic systems. It was first made for modal logics, and later adapted to intuitionistic logic and other non-classical systems. The discovery of Kripke semantics was a breakthrough in the making of non-classical logics, because the model theory of such logics was absent before Kripke.\n\nA Kripke frame or modal frame is a pair formula_1, where \"W\" is a non-empty set, and \"R\" is a binary relation on \"W\". Elements of \"W\" are called \"nodes\" or \"worlds\", and \"R\" is known as the accessibility relation. Depending on the properties of the accessibility relation (transitivity, reflexivity, etc.), the corresponding frame is described, by extension, as being transitive, reflexive, etc.\n\nA Kripke model is a triple formula_2, where formula_1 is a Kripke frame, and formula_4 is a relation between nodes of \"W\" and modal formulas, such that:\n\n\nWe read formula_13 as \"\"w\" satisfies \"A\", \"A\" is satisfied in \"w\", or \"w\" forces \"A\"\". The relation formula_4 is called the \"satisfaction relation\", \"evaluation\", or \"forcing relation\". The satisfaction relation is uniquely determined by its value on propositional variables.\n\nA formula \"A\" is valid in:\n\n\nWe define Thm(\"C\") to be the set of all formulas that are valid in \"C\". Conversely, if \"X\" is a set of formulas, let Mod(\"X\") be the class of all frames which validate every formula from \"X\".\n\nA modal logic (i.e., a set of formulas) \"L\" is sound with respect to a class of frames \"C\", if \"L\" ⊆ Thm(\"C\"). \"L\" is complete with respect to \"C\" if \"L\" ⊇ Thm(\"C\").\n\nSemantics is useful for investigating a logic (i.e., a derivation system) only if the semantical entailment relation reflects its syntactical counterpart, the \"consequence\" relation (\"derivability\"). It is vital to know which modal logics are sound and complete with respect to a class of Kripke frames, and for them, to determine which class it is.\n\nFor any class \"C\" of Kripke frames, Thm(\"C\") is a normal modal logic (in particular, theorems of the minimal normal modal logic, \"K\", are valid in every Kripke model). However, the converse does not hold generally. There are Kripke incomplete normal modal logics, which is unproblematic, because most of the modal systems studied are complete of classes of frames described by simple conditions.\n\nA normal modal logic \"L\" corresponds to a class of frames \"C\", if \"C\" = Mod(\"L\"). In other words, \"C\" is the largest class of frames such that \"L\" is sound wrt \"C\". It follows that \"L\" is Kripke complete if and only if it is complete of its corresponding class.\n\nConsider the schema T : formula_20. T is valid in any reflexive frame formula_1: if formula_22, then formula_13 since \"w\" \"R\" \"w\". On the other hand, a frame which validates T has to be reflexive: fix \"w\" ∈ \"W\", and define satisfaction of a propositional variable \"p\" as follows: formula_24 if and only if \"w\" \"R\" \"u\". Then formula_25, thus formula_26 by T, which means \"w\" \"R\" \"w\" using the definition of formula_4. T corresponds to the class of reflexive Kripke frames.\n\nIt is often much easier to characterize the corresponding class of \"L\" than to prove its completeness, thus correspondence serves as a guide to completeness proofs. Correspondence is also used to show \"incompleteness\" of modal logics: suppose \"L\" ⊆ \"L\" are normal modal logics that correspond to the same class of frames, but \"L\" does not prove all theorems of \"L\". Then \"L\" is Kripke incomplete. For example, the schema formula_28 generates an incomplete logic, as it corresponds to the same class of frames as GL (viz. transitive and converse well-founded frames), but does not prove the GL-tautology formula_29.\n\nFor any normal modal logic \"L\", a Kripke model (called the canonical model) can be constructed, which validates precisely the theorems of \"L\", by an adaptation of the standard technique of using maximal consistent sets as models. Canonical Kripke models play a role similar to the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra construction in algebraic semantics.\n\nA set of formulas is \"L\"-\"consistent\" if no contradiction can be derived from them using the axioms of \"L\", and modus ponens. A \"maximal L-consistent set\" (an \"L\"-\"MCS\" for short) is an \"L\"-consistent set which has no proper \"L\"-consistent superset.\n\nThe canonical model of \"L\" is a Kripke model formula_2, where \"W\" is the set of all \"L\"-\"MCS\", and the relations \"R\" and formula_4 are as follows:\n\nThe canonical model is a model of \"L\", as every \"L\"-\"MCS\" contains all theorems of \"L\". By Zorn's lemma, each \"L\"-consistent set is contained in an \"L\"-\"MCS\", in particular every formula unprovable in \"L\" has a counterexample in the canonical model.\n\nThe main application of canonical models are completeness proofs. Properties of the canonical model of K immediately imply completeness of K with respect to the class of all Kripke frames. This argument does \"not\" work for arbitrary \"L\", because there is no guarantee that the underlying \"frame\" of the canonical model satisfies the frame conditions of \"L\".\n\nWe say that a formula or a set \"X\" of formulas is canonical with respect to a property \"P\" of Kripke frames, if\n\n\nA union of canonical sets of formulas is itself canonical. It follows from the preceding discussion that any logic axiomatized by a canonical set of formulas is Kripke complete, and compact.\n\nThe axioms T, 4, D, B, 5, H, G (and thus any combination of them) are canonical. GL and Grz are not canonical, because they are not compact. The axiom M by itself is not canonical (Goldblatt, 1991), but the combined logic S4.1 (in fact, even K4.1) is canonical.\n\nIn general, it is undecidable whether a given axiom is canonical. We know a nice sufficient condition: H. Sahlqvist identified a broad class of formulas (now called Sahlqvist formulas) such that:\n\n\nThis is a powerful criterion: for example, all axioms listed above as canonical are (equivalent to) Sahlqvist formulas. A logic has the finite model property (FMP) if it is complete with respect to a class of finite frames. An application of this notion is the decidability question: it follows from Post's theorem that a recursively axiomatized modal logic L which has FMP is decidable, provided it is decidable whether a given finite frame is a model of L. In particular, every finitely axiomatizable logic with FMP is decidable.\n\nThere are various methods for establishing FMP for a given logic. Refinements and extensions of the canonical model construction often work, using tools such as filtration or unravelling. As another possibility, completeness proofs based on cut-free sequent calculi usually produce finite models directly.\n\nMost of the modal systems used in practice (including all listed above) have FMP.\n\nIn some cases, we can use FMP to prove Kripke completeness of a logic: every normal modal logic is complete wrt a class of modal algebras, and a finite modal algebra can be transformed into a Kripke frame. As an example, Robert Bull proved using this method that every normal extension of S4.3 has FMP, and is Kripke complete.\n\nKripke semantics has a straightforward generalization to logics with more than one modality. A Kripke frame for a language with\nformula_38 as the set of its necessity operators consists of a non-empty set \"W\" equipped with binary relations \"R\" for each \"i\" ∈ \"I\". The definition of a satisfaction relation is modified as follows:\n\nA simplified semantics, discovered by Tim Carlson, is often used for polymodal provability logics. A Carlson model is a structure formula_41 with a single accessibility relation \"R\", and subsets \"D\" ⊆ \"W\" for each modality. Satisfaction is defined as:\n\nCarlson models are easier to visualize and to work with than usual polymodal Kripke models; there are, however, Kripke complete polymodal logics which are Carlson incomplete.\n\nIn \"Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic\", published in 1963, Kripke responded to a difficulty with classical quantification theory. The motivation for the world-relative approach was to represent the possibility that objects in one world may fail to exist in another. If standard quantifier rules are used, however, every term must refer to something that exists in all the possible worlds. This seems incompatible with our ordinary practice of using terms to refer to things that exist contingently.\n\nKripke's response to this difficulty was to eliminate terms. He gave an example of a system that uses the world-relative interpretation and preserves the classical rules. However, the costs are severe. First, his language is artificially impoverished, and second, the rules for the propositional modal logic must be weakened.\n\nKripke's possible worlds theory has been used by narratologists (beginning with Pavel and Dolezel) to understand \"reader's manipulation of alternative plot developments, or the characters' planned or fantasized alternative action series.\" This application has become especially useful in the analysis of hyperfiction.\n\nKripke semantics for intuitionistic logic follows the same principles as the semantics of modal logic, but uses a different definition of satisfaction.\n\nAn intuitionistic Kripke model is a triple\nformula_44, where formula_45 is a partially ordered Kripke frame, and formula_4 satisfies the following conditions:\n\nIntuitionistic logic is sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics, and it has the Finite Model Property.\n\nIntuitionistic first-order logic\n\nLet \"L\" be a first-order language. A Kripke model of \"L\" is a triple\nformula_61, where\nformula_45 is an intuitionistic Kripke frame, \"M\" is a\n(classical) \"L\"-structure for each node \"w\" ∈ \"W\", and the following compatibility conditions hold whenever \"u\" ≤ \"v\":\nGiven an evaluation \"e\" of variables by elements of \"M\", we define the satisfaction relation formula_63:\nHere \"e\"(\"x\"→\"a\") is the evaluation which gives \"x\" the value \"a\", and otherwise agrees with \"e\".\n\nThe three lectures that form \"Naming and Necessity\" constitute an attack on descriptivist theory of names. Kripke attributes variants of descriptivist theories to Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein and John Searle, among others. According to descriptivist theories, proper names either are synonymous with descriptions, or have their reference determined by virtue of the name's being associated with a description or cluster of descriptions that an object uniquely satisfies. Kripke rejects both these kinds of descriptivism. He gives several examples purporting to render descriptivism implausible as a theory of how names get their references determined (e.g., surely Aristotle could have died at age two and so not satisfied any of the descriptions we associate with his name, but it would seem wrong to deny that he was still Aristotle).\n\nAs an alternative, Kripke outlined a causal theory of reference, according to which a name refers to an object by virtue of a causal connection with the object as mediated through communities of speakers. He points out that proper names, in contrast to most descriptions, are rigid designators: that is, a proper name refers to the named object in every possible world in which the object exists, while most descriptions designate different objects in different possible worlds. For example, \"Richard Nixon\" refers to the same person in every possible world in which Nixon exists, while \"the person who won the United States presidential election of 1968\" could refer to Nixon, Humphrey, or others in different possible worlds.\n\nKripke also raised the prospect of \"a posteriori necessities\" — facts that are necessarily true, though they can be known only through empirical investigation. Examples include \"Hesperus is Phosphorus\", \"Cicero is Tully\", \"Water is HO\" and other identity claims where two names refer to the same object.\n\nFinally, Kripke gave an argument against identity materialism in the philosophy of mind, the view that every mental particular is identical with some physical particular. Kripke argued that the only way to defend this identity is as an \"a posteriori\" necessary identity, but that such an identity — e.g., that pain is C-fibers firing — could not be necessary, given the (clearly conceivable) possibility that pain could be separate from the firing of C-fibers, or the firing of C-fibers be separate from pain. (Similar arguments have since been made by David Chalmers.) In any event, the psychophysical identity theorist, according to Kripke, incurs a dialectical obligation to explain the apparent logical possibility of these circumstances, since according to such theorists they should be impossible.\n\nKripke delivered the John Locke lectures in philosophy at Oxford in 1973. Titled \"Reference and Existence\", they are in many respects a continuation of \"Naming and Necessity\", and deal with the subjects of fictional names and perceptual error. They were recently published by Oxford University Press.\n\nIn a 1995 paper, philosopher Quentin Smith argued that key concepts in Kripke's new theory of reference originated in the work of Ruth Barcan Marcus more than a decade earlier. Smith identified six significant ideas in the New Theory that he claimed Marcus had developed: (1) that proper names are direct references that do not consist of contained definitions; (2) that while one can single out a single thing by a description, this description is not equivalent to a proper name of this thing; (3) the modal argument that proper names are directly referential, and not disguised descriptions; (4) a formal modal logic proof of the necessity of identity; (5) the concept of a rigid designator, though Kripke coined that term; and (6) \"a posteriori\" identity. Smith argued that Kripke failed to understand Marcus's theory at the time but later adopted many of its key conceptual themes in his New Theory of Reference.\n\nOther scholars have subsequently offered detailed responses arguing that no plagiarism occurred.\n\nKripke's main propositions about proper names in \"Naming and Necessity\" are that the meaning of a name simply is the object it refers to and that a name's referent is determined by a causal link between some sort of \"baptism\" and the utterance of the name. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the possibility that propositions containing names may have some additional semantic properties, properties that could explain why two names referring to the same person may give different truth values in propositions about beliefs. For example, Lois Lane believes that Superman can fly, although she does not believe that Clark Kent can fly. This can be accounted for if the names \"Superman\" and \"Clark Kent\", though referring to the same person, have distinct semantic properties.\n\nBut in his article \"A Puzzle about Belief\" Kripke seems to oppose even this possibility. His argument can be reconstructed as follows: The idea that two names referring to the same object may have different semantic properties is supposed to explain that coreferring names behave differently in propositions about beliefs (as in Lois Lane's case). But the same phenomenon occurs even with coreferring names that obviously have the same semantic properties: Kripke invites us to imagine a French, monolingual boy, Pierre, who believes that \"Londres est joli\" (\"London is beautiful\"). Pierre moves to London without realizing that London = Londres. He then learns English the same way a child would learn the language, that is, not by translating words from French to English. Pierre learns the name \"London\" from the unattractive part of the city where he lives, and so comes to believe that London is not beautiful. If Kripke's account is correct, Pierre now believes both that \"Londres\" is \"joli\" and that London is not beautiful. This cannot be explained by coreferring names having different semantic properties. According to Kripke, this demonstrates that attributing additional semantic properties to names does not explain what it is intended to.\n\nFirst published in 1982, Kripke's \"Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language\" contends that the central argument of Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\" centers on a devastating rule-following paradox that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language. Kripke writes that this paradox is \"the most radical and original skeptical problem that philosophy has seen to date\", and that Wittgenstein does not reject the argument that leads to the rule-following paradox, but accepts it and offers a \"skeptical solution\" to ameliorate the paradox's destructive effects.\n\nMost commentators accept that \"Philosophical Investigations\" contains the rule-following paradox as Kripke presents it, but few have agreed with his attributing a skeptical solution to Wittgenstein. It should be noted that Kripke himself expresses doubts in \"Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language\" as to whether Wittgenstein would endorse his interpretation of \"Philosophical Investigations.\" He says that the work should not be read as an attempt to give an accurate statement of Wittgenstein's views, but rather as an account of Wittgenstein's argument \"as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him\".\n\nThe portmanteau \"Kripkenstein\" has been coined for Kripke's interpretation of \"Philosophical Investigations\". Kripkenstein's main significance was a clear statement of a new kind of skepticism, dubbed \"meaning skepticism\": the idea that for an isolated individual there is no fact in virtue of which he/she means one thing rather than another by the use of a word. Kripke's \"skeptical solution\" to meaning skepticism is to ground meaning in the behavior of a community.\n\nKripke's book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his skeptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as Gordon Baker and Peter Hacker, who argue that his meaning skepticism is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke's position has been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher Martin Kusch, and Wittgenstein scholar David G. Stern considers Kripke's book \"the most influential and widely discussed\" work on Wittgenstein since the 1980s.\n\nIn his 1975 article \"Outline of a Theory of Truth\", Kripke showed that a language can consistently contain its own truth predicate, something deemed impossible by Alfred Tarski, a pioneer in formal theories of truth. The approach involves letting truth be a partially defined property over the set of grammatically well-formed sentences in the language. Kripke showed how to do this recursively by starting from the set of expressions in a language that do not contain the truth predicate, and defining a truth predicate over just that segment: this action adds new sentences to the language, and truth is in turn defined for all of them. Unlike Tarski's approach, however, Kripke's lets \"truth\" be the union of all of these definition-stages; after a denumerable infinity of steps the language reaches a \"fixed point\" such that using Kripke's method to expand the truth-predicate does not change the language any further. Such a fixed point can then be taken as the basic form of a natural language containing its own truth predicate. But this predicate is undefined for any sentences that do not, so to speak, \"bottom out\" in simpler sentences not containing a truth predicate. That is, \" 'Snow is white' is true\" is well-defined, as is \" ' \"Snow is white\" is true' is true,\" and so forth, but neither \"This sentence is true\" nor \"This sentence is not true\" receive truth-conditions; they are, in Kripke's terms, \"ungrounded.\"\n\nNevertheless, it has been shown by Gödel that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects (such as integers) can have an informal self-referential meaning, and this idea – manifested by the diagonal lemma – is the basis for Tarski's theorem that truth cannot be consistently defined. It has thus been claimed that Kripke's suggestion does lead to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. There is still a debate about whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every variation of such a partial truth system, but none has been shown to be consistent by acceptable proving methods used in mathematical logic.\n\nKripke's proposal is also problematic in the sense that while the language contains a \"truth\" predicate of itself (at least a partial one), some of its sentences – such as the liar sentence (\"this sentence is false\") – have an undefined truth value, but the language does not contain its own \"undefined\" predicate. In fact it cannot, as that would create a new version of the liar paradox, called the \"strengthened liar paradox\" (\"this sentence is false or undefined\"). Thus while the liar sentence is undefined in the language, the language cannot express that it is undefined.\n\nKripke is an observant Jew.\nOn how his religious views influenced his philosophical views, he has said: \"I don't have the prejudices many have today. I don't believe in a naturalist worldview. I don't base my thinking on prejudices or a worldview and do not believe in materialism.\"\n\nThe Saul Kripke Center at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York is dedicated to preserving and promoting Kripke's work. Its director is Gary Ostertag. The SKC holds events related to Kripke's work and is creating a digital archive of previously unpublished recordings of Kripke's lectures, lecture notes, and correspondence dating back to the 1950s. In his favorable review of Kripke's \"Philosophical Troubles\", the Stanford philosopher Mark Crimmins wrote, \"That four of the most admired and discussed essays in 1970s philosophy are here is enough to make this first volume of Saul Kripke's collected articles a must-have... The reader's delight will grow as hints are dropped that there is a great deal more to come in this series being prepared by Kripke and an ace team of philosopher-editors at the Saul Kripke Center at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Under color removal is used in four-color (or more colors) printing. Black ink used to add details and darkness in shadowed areas is called a \"Skeletal Black\".\n\nWith current ink technology, the total CMYK ink in the shadows refuses to stick after it reaches the dark shadows (usually above a 250% total CMYK coverage), and begins to peel off. To prevent this, printers developed UCR, in which neutral shadows – which would have normally been produced by overprinting the four inks \"Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black\" on top of each other (high ink coverage) – are replaced with the single layer of \"Black\". UCR removes the color inks \"under\" the Black, resulting in a single layer of ink which sticks to the sheet better, and saves on the consumption of ink.\n\nThere is no universal rule for UCR. The amount required will depend on the printing press, paper, and ink in use. \n\nUCR is generally not recommended for use in printing, due to its tendency to produce dull-looking images and artwork. (The problem of \"looking dull\" can often be obviated on coated paper by use of an aqueous coating or UV coating applied on the press or as post-press. A press-applied coating can also eliminate the \"ink sticking\" problem.) The main exception to this rule is that where working in newsprint, UCR is the best way to avoid the associated ink limit and registration issues. UCR is also recommended for some specific paper stocks, depending on the coloration and texture of the paper.\n\n"}
{"id": "23672633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23672633", "title": "Wattle and daub", "text": "Wattle and daub\n\nWattle and daub is a composite building material used for making walls, in which a woven lattice of wooden strips called \"wattle\" is \"daubed\" with a sticky material usually made of some combination of wet soil, clay, sand, animal dung and straw. Wattle and daub has been used for at least 6,000 years and is still an important construction material in many parts of the world. Many historic buildings include wattle and daub construction, and the technique is becoming popular again in more developed areas as a low-impact sustainable building technique.\n\nThe wattle is made by weaving thin branches (either whole, or more usually split) or slats between upright stakes. The wattle may be made as loose panels, slotted between timber framing to make infill panels, or made in place to form the whole of a wall. In different regions, the material of wattle can be different. For example, in Mitchell Site on the northern outskirts of the city of Mitchell, South Dakota, willow has been found as the wattle material of the walls of the house. Reeds and vines can also be used as wattle material. The origin of the term \"wattle\" describing a group of acacias in Australia, is derived from the common use of acacias as wattle in early Australian European settlements.\n\nDaub is usually created from a mixture of ingredients from three categories: binders, aggregates and reinforcement. Binders hold the mix together and can include clay, lime, chalk dust and limestone dust. Aggregates give the mix its bulk and dimensional stability through materials such as earth, sand, crushed chalk and crushed stone. Reinforcement is provided by straw, hair, hay or other fibrous materials, and helps to hold the mix together as well as to control shrinkage and provide flexibility. The daub may be mixed by hand, or by treading – either by humans or livestock. It is then applied to the wattle and allowed to dry, and often then whitewashed to increase its resistance to rain. Sometimes there can be more than one layer of daub. Still in Mitchell Site, the anterior of the house had double layers of burned daub. \n\nThis process has been replaced in modern architecture by lath and plaster, a common building material for wall and ceiling surfaces, in which a series of nailed wooden strips are covered with plaster smoothed into a flat surface. In many regions this building method has itself been overtaken by drywall construction using plasterboard sheets.\n\nThe wattle and daub technique was used already in the Neolithic period. It was common for houses of a Linear pottery and Rössen cultures of Central Europe, but is also found in Western Asia (Çatalhöyük, Shillourokambos) as well as in North America (Mississippian culture) and South America (Brazil). In Africa it is common in the architecture of traditional houses such as those of the Ashanti people. Its usage dates back at least 6000 years. There are suggestions that construction techniques such as lath and plaster and even cob may have evolved from wattle and daub. Fragments from prehistoric wattle and daub buildings have been found in Africa, Europe, Mesoamerica and North America. A review of English architecture especially reveals that the sophistication of this craft is dependent on the various styles of timber frame housing.\n\nAs discussed earlier, there were two popular choices for wattle and daub infill paneling: close-studded paneling and square paneling.\n\nClose-studding panels create a much more narrow space between the timbers: anywhere from 7 to 16 inches (18 to 40 cm). For this style of panel, weaving is too difficult, so the wattles run horizontally and are known as ledgers. The ledgers are sprung into each upright timber (stud) through a system of augered holes on one side and short chiseled grooves along the other. The holes (along with holes of square paneling) are drilled at a slight angle towards the outer face of each stud. This allows room for upright hazels to be tied to ledgers from the inside of the building. The horizontal ledgers are placed every two to three feet (0.6 to 0.9 metres) with whole hazel rods positioned upright top to bottom and lashed to the ledgers. These hazel rods are generally tied a finger widths apart with 6–8 rods each with a 16-inch (40 cm) width. Gaps allow key formation for drying.\n\nSquare panels are large, wide panels typical of some later timber frame houses. These panels may be square in shape, or sometimes triangular to accommodate arched or decorative bracing. This style does require wattles to be woven for better support of the daub.\n\nTo insert wattles in a square panel several steps are required. First, a series of evenly spaced holes are drilled along the middle of the inner face of each upper timber. Next, a continuous groove is cut along the middle of each inner face of the lower timber in each panel. Vertical slender timbers, known as staves, are then inserted and these hold the whole panel within the timber frame. The staves are positioned into the holes and then sprung into the grooves. They must be placed with sufficient gaps to weave the flexible horizontal wattles.\n\nIn some places or cultures, the technique of wattle and daub were used with different materials thus has different names, including pug and pine, mud and stud (stud and mud), hourdis, rab (rad) and dab, pierrotage/bousillage (bouzillage) and columage. Bajarreque and jacal are examples of structure built with the technique of wattle and daub.\nIn the early days of the colonisation of South Australia, in areas where substantial timber was unavailable, pioneers' cottages and other small buildings were frequently constructed with light vertical timbers, which may have been \"native pine\" (\"Callitris\" or \"Casuarina\" spp.), driven into the ground, the gaps being stopped with \"pug\" (kneaded clay and grass mixture). Another term for this construction is \"palisade and pug\".\n\n\"Mud and stud\" is a similar process to wattle and daub, with a simple frame consisting only of upright studs joined by cross rails at the tops and bottoms. Thin staves of ash were attached, then daubed with a mixture of mud, straw, hair and dung. The style of building was once common in Lincolnshire.\n\nPierrotage is the infilling material used in French Vernacular architecture of the Southern United States to infill between half-timbering with diagonal braces, which is similar with daub. It is usually made of lime mortar clay mixed with small stones. It is also called bousillage or bouzillage, especially in French Vernacular architecture of Louisiana of the early 1700s. The materials of bousillage are Spanish moss or clay and grass. Bousillage also refers to the type of brick molded with the same materials and used as infilling between posts. Columbage refers to the timber-framed construction with diagonal bracing of the framework. Pierratage or bousillage is the material filled into the structural timbers.\n\nBajarreque is a wall constructed with the technique of wattle and daub. The wattle here is made of bagasse, and the daub is the mix of clay and straw.\n\nJacal can refer to a type of crude house whose wall is built with wattle and daub in southwestern America. Closely spaced upright sticks or poles driven into the ground with small branches (wattle) interwoven between them make the structural frame of the wall. Mud or an adobe clay (daub) is covered outside. To provide additional weather protection, the wall is usually plastered.\n\n"}
