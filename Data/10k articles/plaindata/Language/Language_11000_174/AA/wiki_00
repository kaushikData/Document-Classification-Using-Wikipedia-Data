{"id": "8375902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8375902", "title": "Bengali Wikipedia", "text": "Bengali Wikipedia\n\nThe Bengali Wikipedia or Bangla Wikipedia (, \"Bānglā u'ikipiḍiẏā\") is the Bengali language edition of Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia. It also has a phonetic Latin alphabet to Bengali script tool so Latin alphabet keyboards can be used to type Bengali without downloading any software.\n\nLaunched in January 27, 2004, it surpassed 10,000 articles in October 2006, becoming the second South-Asian language to do so. In , total article crossed articles. Community-produced news publications include ‘WikiBarta’.\n\nIn February 2002, the developers started creating language-code based sub-domains for different language Wikipedias. Along with other Wikipedia sub-domains, Bengali language sub-domain was created at that time. A placeholder page was created automatically in that sub-domain on June 1, 2002. On December 9, 2003, A Bangladeshi Ph.D. student of Canada's McGill University named Shah Asaduzzaman emailed Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales with a request to create Bengali Wikipedia. As a result, the developers created a test page on the Wikipedia named \"Home Page\" on December 26 of the same year.\n\nThe Main Page of Bengali Wikipedia was created on January 27, 2004 from an IP address which marks the official beginning of Bengali Wikipedia. '' (\"Bānglā Bhāshā\"; Bengali Language in English) is the first article of Bengali Wikipedia which was created on May 24, 2004.\n\nBengali Wikipedia started its journey in January 27, 2004. Back then, the people of Bangladesh had a little interest in Wikipedia. A few students and scholars used the English Wikipedia, but it was not accountable. Besides that, there were various difficulties contributing in Bengali. The whole scenario has been changed in 2006. During that time, the Bengali blogging world was growing slowly, and many people became accustomed to Bengali computing where a free and open-source Bengali typing tool, Avro Keyboard played a key role. On March 25, 2006, a Wiki team was created by the ‘Bangladesh Open Source Network’ (BdOSN) to popularize Wikipedia throughout the country. The aim was to represent the country to the world through Wikipedia and build a complete encyclopedia in Bengali.\n\nAt that time, Bengali Wikipedia had only 500 articles. ‘BdOSN wiki team’ managed to spread the word through some newspapers and start a Bengali Wiki mailing list. Soon, many Bengali-speaking people from Bangladesh and abroad joined them in this dynamic project. As a result, by the end of the October, Bengali Wikipedia got to 10,000 articles. Among the South Asian language Wikipedias, Bengali Wikipedia reached that milestone first, and many of these articles were illustrated with photos from the demonstrator of Bengali Language Movement Dr. Rafiqul Islam, who donated all his historical photographs taken during the language movement to Wikimedia Commons.\n\nOne of the pioneer of the Bengali Wikipedia, Dr. Ragib Hasan said that \n\nBetween 2009 and 2010, Bengali speakers from West Bengal, India also started to contribute to Bengali Wikipedia. In the meantime, the Wikimedia Foundation started their operations and in October 3, 2011 a local chapter named Wikimedia Bangladesh was approved in Bangladesh by the Foundation to promote educational content in Bengali. On February 26, 2015, Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia—visited Bangladesh for a celebration program that was organized by Wikimedia Bangladesh to mark the tenth year of Bengali Wikipedia. In his keynote, Jimmy said that according to the article depth, Bengali Wikipedia is rated quite well.\n\nBengali Wikipedia now has articles on various topics with active editors per month. As of September 2018, Bengali Wikipedia is the only online free encyclopedia written in Bengali language. It is also one of the largest Bengali content related sites on the internet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4198908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4198908", "title": "Bengalis", "text": "Bengalis\n\nBengalis ( ), also rendered as the Bengali people, Bangalis and Bangalees, are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group native to the Bengal region in South Asia, specifically in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, presently divided between Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura, Assam's Barak Valley, who speak Bengali, a language from the Indo-Aryan language family. The term \"Bangalee\" is also used to denote people of Bangladesh as a nation.\n\nBengalis are the third largest ethnic group in the world, after Han Chinese and Arabs. Apart from Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura, Assam's Barak Valley, Bengali-majority populations also reside in India's union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands as well as Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts which was originally not a part of Bengal, with significant populations in Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Uttarakhand. The global Bengali diaspora (Bangladeshi diaspora and Indian Bengalis) have well-established communities in Pakistan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Middle East, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Italy.\n\nThey have four major religious subgroups: Bengali Muslims, Bengali Hindus, Bengali Christians, and Bengali Buddhists.\n\nIn modern usage, \"Bengali\" or \"Bangali\" is used to refer to anyone whose linguistic, cultural, family ancestral or genetic origins are from Bengal. Their ethnonym is derived from the ancient Banga or Bangla. The exact origin of the word \"Bangla\" is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe \"Bang/Banga\" that settled in the area around the year 2500 BCE. Other accounts speculate that the name is derived from \"Venga\" (\"Bôngo\"), which came from the Austric word \"Bonga\" meaning the Sun-god. According to the Mahabharata, the Puranas and the Harivamsha, Vanga was one of the adopted sons of King Vali who founded the Vanga Kingdom. It was either under Magadh or under Kalinga Rules except few years under Pals.The Muslim accounts refer that \"Bong\", a son of Hind (son of Hām who was a son of Prophet Noah/Nooh) colonised the area for the first time. The earliest reference to \"Vangala\" (\"Bôngal\") has been traced in the Nesari plates (805 CE) of Rashtrakuta Govinda III which speak of Dharmapala as the king of Vangala. The records of Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty, who invaded Bengal in the 11th century, speak of Govindachandra as the ruler of Vangaladesa. Shams-ud-din Ilyas Shah took the title \"Shah-e-Bangla\" and united the whole region under one government.\n\nAn interesting theory of the origin of the name is provided by \"Abu'l-Fazl\" in his \"Ain-i-Akbari\". According to him, \"The original name of Bengal was Bung, and the suffix \"al\" came to be added to it from the fact that the ancient rajahs of this land raised mounds of earth 10 feet high and 20 in breadth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were called \"al\". From this suffix added to the Bung, the name Bengal arose and gained currency\".\n\nArchaeologists have discovered remnants of a 4,000-year-old Chalcolithic civilisation in the greater Bengal region, and believe the finds are one of the earliest signs of settlement in the region. However, evidence of much older Palaeolithic human habitations were found in the form of a stone implement and a hand axe in Rangamati and Feni districts of Bangladesh. The origin of the word \"Bangla ~ Bengal\" is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from a tribe called \"Bang\" that settled in the area around the year 1000 BCE.\n\nKingdoms of Pundra and Vanga were formed in Bengal and were first described in the \"Atharvaveda\" around 1000 BCE as well as in Hindu epic Mahabharata. Anga and later Magadha expanded to include most of the Bihar and Bengal regions. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of Buddha and was one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas. Under the Maurya Empire founded by Chandragupta Maurya, Magadha extended over nearly all of South Asia, including parts of Balochistan and Afghanistan, reaching its greatest extent under the Buddhist emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE.\n\nOne of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is the mention of a land ruled by the king Xandrammes named Gangaridai by the Greeks around 100 BCE. The word is speculated to have come from \"Gangahrd\" ('Land with the Ganges in its heart') in reference to an area in Bengal. Later from the 3rd to the 6th centuries CE, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire.\n\nOne of the first recorded independent kings of Bengal was Shashanka, reigning around the early 7th century. After a period of anarchy, Gopala came to power in 750. He founded the Bengali Buddhist Pala Empire which ruled the region for four hundred years, and expanded across much of Southern Asia: from Assam in the northeast, to Kabul in the west, and to Andhra Pradesh in the south. Atisha was a renowned Bengali Buddhist teacher who was instrumental in the revival of Buddhism in Tibet and also held the position of Abbot at the Vikramshila university. Tilopa was also from the Bengal region.\n\nThe Pala Empire enjoyed relations with the Srivijaya Empire, the Tibetan Empire, and the Arab Abbasid Caliphate. Islam first appeared in Bengal during Pala rule, as a result of increased trade between Bengal and the Middle East.\n\nThe Pala dynasty was later followed by a shorter reign of the Hindu Sena Empire. Islam was introduced to Bengal in the twelfth century by Sufi missionaries. Subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region. Bakhtiar Khalji, a Turkic general of the Slave dynasty of Delhi Sultanate, defeated Lakshman Sen of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal. Consequently, the region was ruled by dynasties of sultans and feudal lords under the Bengal Sultanate for the next few hundred years. Islam was introduced to the Sylhet region by the Muslim saint Shah Jalal in the early 14th century.\n\nThe Mughal Empire conquered Bengal in the 16th century. Mughal general Man Singh conquered parts of Bengal including Dhaka during the time of Emperor Akbar. A few Rajput tribes from his army permanently settled around Dhaka and surrounding lands. Later, in the early 17th century, Islam Khan conquered all of Bengal. However, administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence of the area under the Nawabs of Murshidabad, who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi.\n\nThe Bengal Subah province in the Mughal Empire was the wealthiest state in the subcontinent. Bengal's trade and wealth impressed the Mughals so much that it was described as the \"Paradise of the Nations\" by the Mughal Emperors.\n\nUnder Mughal rule, Bengal was a center of the worldwide muslin, silk and pearl trades. During the Mughal era, the most important center of cotton production was Bengal, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka, leading to muslin being called \"daka\" in distant markets such as Central Asia. Domestically, much of India depended on Bengali products such as rice, silks and cotton textiles. Overseas, Europeans depended on Bengali products such as cotton textiles, silks and opium; Bengal accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia, for example, including more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks. From Bengal, saltpeter was also shipped to Europe, opium was sold in Indonesia, raw silk was exported to Japan and the Netherlands, cotton and silk textiles were exported to Europe, Indonesia, and Japan, cotton cloth was exported to the Americas and the Indian Ocean. Bengal also had a large shipbuilding industry. In terms of shipbuilding tonnage during the 16th–18th centuries, the annual output of Bengal alone totaled around 2,232,500 tons, larger than the combined output of the Dutch (450,000–550,000 tons), the British (340,000 tons), and North America (23,061 tons).\n\nAfter the weakening of the Mughal Empire with the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, Bengal was ruled independently by the Nawabs until 1757, when the region was annexed by the East India Company after the Battle of Plassey.\n\nIn Bengal effective political and military power was transferred from the old regime to the British East India Company around 1757–65.\nCompany rule in India began under the Bengal Presidency. Calcutta was named the capital of British India in 1772. The presidency was run by a military-civil administration, including the Bengal Army, and had the world's sixth earliest railway network. Great Bengal famines struck several times during colonial rule, notably the Great Bengal famine of 1770 and Bengal famine of 1943, each killing millions of Bengalis.\n\nUnder British rule, Bengal experienced deindustrialization. The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was initiated on the outskirts of Calcutta, and spread to Dhaka, Chittagong, Jalpaiguri, Sylhet and Agartala, in solidarity with revolts in North India. The failure of the rebellion led to the abolishment of the Mughal Court and direct rule by the British Raj.\n\nBengal Renaissance refers to a socio-religious reform movement during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, centered around the city of Calcutta and predominantly led by upper caste Bengali Hindus under the patronage of the British Raj who created a reformed religion called Brahmo dharma. The Bengal renaissance can be said to have started with reformer and humanitarian Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1775–1833), considered the \"Father of the Bengal Renaissance\", and ended with Asia's first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941), although there have been many stalwarts thereafter embodying particular aspects of the unique intellectual and creative output. Nineteenth-century Bengal was a unique blend of religious and social reformers, scholars, literary giants, journalists, patriotic orators and scientists, all merging to form the image of a renaissance, and marked the transition from 'medieval' to 'modern'.\n\nOther figures have been considered to be part of the Renaissance. Swami Vivekananda is considered a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and America and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of a world religion during the 1800s. Jagadish Chandra Bose was a Bengali polymath: a physicist, biologist, botanist, archaeologist, and writer of science fiction who pioneered the investigation of radio and microwave optics, made significant contributions to plant science, and laid the foundations of experimental science in the Indian subcontinent. He is considered one of the fathers of radio science, and is also considered the father of Bengali science fiction. Satyendra Nath Bose was a Bengali physicist, specializing in mathematical physics. He is best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, providing the foundation for Bose–Einstein statistics and the theory of the Bose–Einstein condensate. He is honoured as the namesake of the boson.\n\nThough the Bengal Renaissance was the \"culmination of the process of emergence of the cultural characteristics of the Bengali people that had started in the age of Hussein Shah, it remained predominantly Hindu and only partially Muslim.\" There were, nevertheless, examples of Muslim intellectuals such as Syed Ameer Ali, Mosharraf Hussain, Sake Dean Mahomed, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Roquia Sakhawat Hussain. The Freedom of Intellect Movement sought to challenge religious and social dogma in Bengali Muslim society.\n\nBengal played a major role in the Indian independence movement, in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant. Many of the early proponents of the independence struggle, and subsequent leaders in the movement were Bengalis such as Chittaranjan Das, Khwaja Salimullah, Surendranath Banerjea, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Titumir (Sayyid Mir Nisar Ali), Prafulla Chaki, A. K. Fazlul Huq, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, Bagha Jatin, Khudiram Bose, Surya Sen, Binoy-Badal-Dinesh, Sarojini Naidu, Aurobindo Ghosh, Rashbehari Bose, and Sachindranath Sanyal.\n\nSome of these leaders, such as Netaji, who was born, raised and educated at Cuttack in Odisha did not subscribe to the view that non-violent civil disobedience was the best way to achieve Indian Independence, and were instrumental in armed resistance against the British force. Netaji was the co-founder and leader of the Japanese-aligned Indian National Army (distinct from the army of British India) that challenged British forces in several parts of India. He was also the head of state of a parallel regime, the Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind. Bengal was also the fostering ground for several prominent revolutionary organisations, the most notable of which was Anushilan Samiti. A number of Bengalis died during the independence movement and many were imprisoned in Cellular Jail, the notorious prison in Andaman.\n\nThe first partition in 1905 divided the Bengal region in British India into two provinces for administrative and development purposes. However, the partition stoked Hindu nationalism. This in turn led to the formation of the All India Muslim League in Dhaka in 1906 to represent the growing aspirations of the Muslim population. The partition was annulled in 1912 after protests by the Indian National Congress and Hindu Mahasabha.\n\nThe breakdown of Hindu-Muslim unity in India drove the Muslim League to adopt the Lahore Resolution in 1943, calling the creation of \"independent states\" in eastern and northwestern British India. The resolution paved the way for the Partition of British India based on the Radcliffe Line in 1947, despite attempts to form a United Bengal state that was opposed by many people.\n\nThe legacy of partition has left lasting differences between the two sides of Bengal, most notably in linguistic accent and cuisine.\n\nThe rise of self-determination and Bengali nationalism movements in East Bengal (later East Pakistan), led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, culminated in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War against the Pakistani military junta. An estimated 3 million (3,000,000) people died in the conflict, particularly as a result of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. The war caused millions of East Pakistani refugees to take shelter in India's Bengali state West Bengal, with Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal province, becoming the capital-in-exile of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh. The Mukti Bahini guerrilla forces waged a nine-month war against the Pakistani military. The conflict ended after the Indian Armed Forces intervened on the side of Bangladeshi forces in the final two weeks of the war, which ended with the Surrender of Pakistan and the liberation of Dhaka on 16 December 1971.\n\nBengali cuisine is the culinary style originating in Bengal, a region of the Indian subcontinent which is now located in Bangladesh and West Bengal. Some Indian regions like Tripura, Shillong and the Barak Valley region of\nAssam (in India) also have large native Bengali populations and share this cuisine. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables, and milk served with rice as a staple diet, Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the Indian subcontinent that is analogous in structure\nto the modern service à la russe style of French cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once.\n\nBengalis celebrate the major holidays of the Muslim and Hindu faiths. For Muslims, these include Eid-ul-Azha, Eid-ul-Fitr, and Muharram. Although Bengali Hindus observe Holi, Diwali, and other important religious festivals, Durga Puja is the biggest and most important to them. Dedicated to the goddess Durga, who is a manifestation of Shakti, the festivities last for five days. Months before the festival, special clay idols of Durga and her children are made. These show her mounted on a lion and killing the evil demon Mahishasura. These lavishly painted and decorated idols are displayed and worshipped on each day of the festival in the pandals and at homes. On the tenth day, the idols are decorated with flowers and carried through the streets in processions. The procession makes its way to a river or other body of water, where the image of Durga is immersed in the water.\n\nBengali or Bangla is the language native to the region of Bengal, which comprises present-day Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and southern Assam. It is written using the Bengali script. With about 250 million native and about 300 million total speakers worldwide, Bengali is one of the most spoken languages, ranked seventh in the world. The National Anthem of Bangladesh, National Anthem of India and the National Song of India were first composed in the Bengali language.\n\nAlong with other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Bengali evolved circa 1000–1200 CE from eastern Middle Indo-Aryan dialects such as the Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, which developed from a dialect or group of dialects that were close, but not identical to, Vedic and Classical Sanskrit.\n\nThe earliest extant work in Bengali literature is the \"Charyapada\", a collection of Buddhist mystic songs dating back to the 10th and 11th centuries. Thereafter, the timeline of Bengali literature is divided into two periods: medieval (1360–1800) and modern (1800–present). Bengali literature is one of the most enriched bodies of literature in Modern India and Bangladesh.\n\nThe first works in Bengali, written in new Bengali, appeared between 10th and 12th centuries CE It is generally known as the \"Charyapada\". These are mystic songs composed by various Buddhist seer-poets: Luipada, Kanhapada, Kukkuripada, Chatilpada, Bhusukupada, Kamlipada, Dhendhanpada, Shantipada, Shabarapada, etc. The famous Bengali linguist Haraprasad Shastri discovered the palm-leaf \"Charyapada\" manuscript in the Nepal Royal Court Library in 1907.\n\nThe Middle Bengali Literature is a period in the history of Bengali literature dating from 15th to 18th centuries. Following the Mughal invasion of Bengal in the 13th century, literature in vernacular Bengali began to take shape. The oldest example of Middle Bengali literature is believed to be \"Shreekrishna Kirtana\" by Boru Chandidas.\nIn the mid-19th century, Bengali literature gained momentum. During this period, the Bengali Pandits of Fort William College did the tedious work of translating textbooks in Bengali to help teach the British local languages including Bengali. This work played a role in the background in the evolution of Bengali prose.\n\nThe largest religions practiced in Bengal are Islam and Hinduism. According to 2014 US Department of State estimates, 89.9% of the population of Bangladesh follow Islam while 8.3% follow Hinduism. In West Bengal, Hindus are the majority with 70.54% of the population while Muslims comprise 27.01%. Other religious groups include Buddhists (comprising around 1% of the population in Bangladesh) and Christians.\n\nBengali theater traces its roots to Sanskrit drama under the Gupta Empire in the 4th century CE. It includes narrative forms, song and dance forms, supra-personae forms, performance with scroll paintings, puppet theatre and the processional forms like the Jatra. \n\nBengal has an extremely rich heritage of dancing dating back to antiquity. It includes classical, folk and martial dance traditions.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51426", "title": "Cantor's diagonal argument", "text": "Cantor's diagonal argument\n\nIn set theory, Cantor's diagonal argument, also called the diagonalisation argument, the diagonal slash argument or the diagonal method, was published in 1891 by Georg Cantor as a mathematical proof that there are infinite sets which cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the infinite set of natural numbers.\nSuch sets are now known as uncountable sets, and the size of infinite sets is now treated by the theory of cardinal numbers which Cantor began.\n\nThe diagonal argument was not Cantor's first proof of the uncountability of the real numbers, which appeared in 1874.\nHowever, it demonstrates a powerful and general technique that has since been used in a wide range of proofs, including the first of Gödel's incompleteness theorems and Turing's answer to the \"Entscheidungsproblem\". Diagonalization arguments are often also the source of contradictions like Russell's paradox and Richard's paradox.\n\nIn his 1891 article, Cantor considered the set \"T\" of all infinite sequences of binary digits (i.e. each digit is zero or one).\nHe begins with a constructive proof of the following theorem:\nThe proof starts with an enumeration of elements from \"T\", for example:\nNext, a sequence \"s\" is constructed by choosing the 1st digit as complementary to the 1st digit of \"s\" (swapping 0s for 1s and vice versa), the 2nd digit as complementary to the 2nd digit of \"s\", the 3rd digit as complementary to the 3rd digit of \"s\", and generally for every \"n\", the \"n\" digit as complementary to the \"n\" digit of \"s\". For the example above, this yields:\nBy construction, \"s\" differs from each \"s\", since their \"n\" digits differ (highlighted in the example).\nHence, \"s\" cannot occur in the enumeration.\n\nBased on this theorem, Cantor then uses a proof by contradiction to show that:\nThe proof starts by assuming that \"T\" is countable.\nThen all its elements can be written as an enumeration \"s\", \"s\", … , \"s\", … .\nApplying the previous theorem to this enumeration produces a sequence \"s\" not belonging to the enumeration. However, this contradicts \"s\" being an element of \"T\" and therefore belonging to the enumeration. This contradiction implies that the original assumption is false. Therefore, \"T\" is uncountable.\n\nThe interpretation of Cantor's result will depend upon one's view of mathematics. To constructivists, the argument shows no more than that there is no bijection between the natural numbers and \"T\". It does not rule out the possibility that the latter are subcountable. In the context of classical mathematics, this is impossible, and the diagonal argument establishes that, although both sets are infinite, there are actually \"more\" infinite sequences of ones and zeros than there are natural numbers.\n\nThe uncountability of the real numbers was already established by Cantor's first uncountability proof, but it also follows from the above result. To prove this, an injection will be constructed from the set \"T\" of infinite binary strings to the set R of real numbers. Since \"T\" is uncountable, the image of this function, which is a subset of R, is uncountable. Therefore, R is uncountable. Also, by using a method of construction devised by Cantor, a bijection will be constructed between \"T\" and R. Therefore, \"T\" and R have the same cardinality, which is called the \"cardinality of the continuum\" and is usually denoted by formula_1 or formula_2.\n\nAn injection from \"T\" to R is given by mapping strings in \"T\" to decimals, such as mapping \"t\" = 0111… to the decimal 0.0111…. This function, defined by , is an injection because it maps different strings to different numbers. \n\nInstead of mapping 0111… to the decimal 0.0111…, it can be mapped to the base \"b\" number: 0.0111…. This leads to the family of functions: . The functions are injections, except for . This function will be modified to produce a bijection between \"T\" and R.\n\nA generalized form of the diagonal argument was used by Cantor to prove Cantor's theorem: for every set \"S\", the power set of \"S\"—that is, the set of all subsets of \"S\" (here written as P(\"S\"))—has a larger cardinality than \"S\" itself. This proof proceeds as follows:\n\nLet \"f\" be any function from \"S\" to P(\"S\"). It suffices to prove \"f\" cannot be surjective. That means that some member \"T\" of P(\"S\"), i.e. some subset of \"S\", is not in the image of \"f\". As a candidate consider the set:\n\nFor every \"s\" in \"S\", either \"s\" is in \"T\" or not. If \"s\" is in \"T\", then by definition of \"T\", \"s\" is not in \"f\"(\"s\"), so \"T\" is not equal to \"f\"(\"s\"). On the other hand, if \"s\" is not in \"T\", then by definition of \"T\", \"s\" is in \"f\"(\"s\"), so again \"T\" is not equal to \"f\"(\"s\"); cf. picture.\nFor a more complete account of this proof, see Cantor's theorem.\n\nThis result implies that the notion of the set of all sets is an inconsistent notion. If \"S\" were the set of all sets then P(\"S\") would at the same time be bigger than \"S\" and a subset of \"S\".\n\nRussell's Paradox has shown us that naive set theory, based on an unrestricted comprehension scheme, is contradictory. Note that there is a similarity between the construction of \"T\" and the set in Russell's paradox. Therefore, depending on how we modify the axiom scheme of comprehension in order to avoid Russell's paradox, arguments such as the non-existence of a set of all sets may or may not remain valid.\n\nThe diagonal argument shows that the set of real numbers is \"bigger\" than the set of natural numbers (and therefore, the integers and rationals as well). Therefore, we can ask if there is a set whose cardinality is \"between\" that of the integers and that of the reals. This question leads to the famous continuum hypothesis. Similarly, the question of whether there exists a set whose cardinality is between |\"S\"| and |P(\"S\")| for some infinite \"S\" leads to the generalized continuum hypothesis.\n\nAnalogues of the diagonal argument are widely used in mathematics to prove the existence or nonexistence of certain objects. For example, the conventional proof of the unsolvability of the halting problem is essentially a diagonal argument. Also, diagonalization was originally used to show the existence of arbitrarily hard complexity classes and played a key role in early attempts to prove P does not equal NP.\n\nThe above proof fails for W. V. Quine's \"New Foundations\" set theory (NF). In NF, the naive axiom scheme of comprehension is modified to avoid the paradoxes by introducing a kind of \"local\" type theory. In this axiom scheme,\n\nis \"not\" a set — i.e., does not satisfy the axiom scheme. On the other hand, we might try to create a modified diagonal argument by noticing that\n\n\"is\" a set in NF. In which case, if P(\"S\") is the set of one-element subsets of \"S\" and \"f\" is a proposed bijection from P(\"S\") to P(\"S\"), one is able to use proof by contradiction to prove that |P(\"S\")| < |P(\"S\")|.\n\nThe proof follows by the fact that if \"f\" were indeed a map \"onto\" P(\"S\"), then we could find \"r\" in \"S\", such that \"f\"({\"r\"}) coincides with the modified diagonal set, above. We would conclude that if \"r\" is not in \"f\"({\"r\"}), then \"r\" is in \"f\"({\"r\"}) and vice versa.\n\nIt is \"not\" possible to put P(\"S\") in a one-to-one relation with \"S\", as the two have different types, and so any function so defined would violate the typing rules for the comprehension scheme.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "761880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=761880", "title": "Catalan phonology", "text": "Catalan phonology\n\nThe phonology of Catalan, a Romance language, has a certain degree of dialectal variation. Although there are two standard dialects, one based on Eastern Catalan and one based on Valencian, this article deals with features of all or most dialects, as well as regional pronunciation differences. Various studies have focused on different Catalan varieties; for example, and analyze Central Eastern varieties, the former focusing on the educated speech of Barcelona and the latter focusing more on the vernacular of Barcelona, and does a careful phonetic study of Central Eastern Catalan.\n\nCatalan is characterized by final-obstruent devoicing, lenition, and voicing assimilation; a set of 7 or 8 phonemic vowels, vowel assimilations (including vowel harmony), many phonetic diphthongs, and vowel reduction, whose precise details differ between dialects. Several dialects have a dark \"l\", and all dialects have palatal \"l\" () and \"n\" ().\n\nPhonetic notes:\n\nVoiced obstruents undergo final-obstruent devoicing so that ('cold', m. s.) is pronounced with , while ('cold', f. pl.) is pronounced with .\n\nVoiced stops become lenited to approximants in syllable onsets, after continuants: → , → , → . Exceptions include after lateral consonants and after , e.g. ('oeil-de-boeuf'), ('excellent ballpoint'). Additionally, fails to lenite in non-betacist dialects. In the coda position, these sounds are always realized as stops except in many Valencian dialects, where they are lenited.\n\nIn some Valencian dialects final can be lenited before a vowel: ('all this').\n\nIn some dialects (e.g. many Valencian accents) initial can be lenited: .\n\nIn many Catalan dialects (except Valencian), and may be geminated in certain environments (e.g. 'village', 'rule').\n\nIn Majorcan varieties, and become and word-finally and before front vowels, in some of these dialects, this has extended to all environments except before liquids and back vowels; e.g. ('blood').\n\nThe phonemic status of affricates is dubious; after other consonants, affricates are in free variation with fricatives, e.g. ~ ('hair parting') and may be analyzed as either single phonemes or clusters of a stop and a fricative.\n\nThere is dialectal variation in regards to affricate length, with long affricates occurring in both Eastern and Western dialects such as in Majorca and few areas in Southern Valencia. Also, intervocalic affricates are predominantly long, especially those that are voiced or occurring immediately after a stressed syllable (e.g. 'medic'). In modern Valencian and have merged into .\n\n occurs in Balearic, as well as in Alguerese, standard Valencian and some areas in southern Catalonia. Everywhere else, it has merged with historic so that and occur in complementary distribution. In Majorcan, and are in complementary distribution, with occurring before vowels (e.g. 'blue' f. vs. 'blue' m.). In other varieties that have both sounds, they are in contrast before vowels, with neutralization in favor of before consonants.\n\nIn some Valencian dialects, and are auditorily similar such that neutralization may occur in the future. That is the case of Northern Valencian where is depalatalized to or as in ('box'). Central Valencian words like ('half') and ('ugly') have been transcribed with rather than the expected , and Southern Valencian \"has been reported to undergo depalatalization without merging with \". as in ('small steps') versus ('promenade')\n\nIn Aragon and Central Valencian (the so called ), voiced fricatives and affricates are missing (i.e. has merged with , has merged with , with only voiceless realizations occurring) and has merged with the set.\n\nWhile \"dark (velarized) l\", , may be a positional allophone of in most dialects (such as in the syllable coda; e.g. 'ground'), is dark irrespective of position in Eastern dialects like Majorcan and standard Eastern Catalan (e.g. ).\n\nThe distribution of the two rhotics and closely parallels that of Spanish. Between vowels, the two contrast (e.g. 'myrrh' vs. 'look'), but they are otherwise in complementary distribution. appears in the onset, except in word-initial position (), after , , and (, ), and in compounds, where is used. Different dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda, with Western Catalan generally featuring and Central Catalan dialects like those of Barcelona or Girona featuring a weakly trilled unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case appears ( in Western Catalan, in Central Catalan). There is free variation in \"r\" word-initially, after , , and , and in compounds (if is preceded by consonant), wherein is pronounced or [], the latter being similar to English \"red\": , , .\n\nIn careful speech, , , and may be geminated (e.g. 'unnecessary'; 'to store'; 'illusion'). A geminated may also occur (e.g. 'line'). analyzes intervocalic as the result of gemination of a single rhotic phoneme: 'saw, mountains' (this is similar to the common analysis of Spanish and Portuguese rhotics).\n\nPhonetic notes:\n\nMost varieties of Catalan contrast seven stressed vowel phonemes. However, some Balearic dialects have an additional stressed vowel phoneme (); e.g. ('dry'). The stressed schwa of these dialects corresponds to in Central Catalan and in Western Catalan varieties (that is, Central and Western Catalan dialects differ in their incidence of and , with appearing more frequently in Western Catalan; e.g. Central Catalan vs. Western Catalan 'dry, I sit').\n\nContrasting series of the main Catalan dialects:\nIn Eastern Catalan, vowels in unstressed position reduce to three : , , ; , , ; remains unchanged. However there are some dialectal differences: Alguerese merges , , and with ; and in most areas of Majorca, can appear in unstressed position (that is, and are usually reduced to ).\n\nIn Western Catalan, vowels in unstressed position reduce to five: , ; , ; remain unchanged. However, in some Western dialects reduced vowels tend to merge into different realizations in some cases:\n\nThere are also a number of phonetic diphthongs and triphthongs, all of which begin and/or end in or .\n\nIn standard Eastern Catalan, rising diphthongs (that is, those starting with or ) are only possible in the following contexts:\n\nThere are certain instances of \"compensatory diphthongization\" in Majorcan so that ('logs') (in addition to deleting the palatal stop) develops a compensating palatal glide and surfaces as (and contrasts with the unpluralized ). Diphthongization compensates for the loss of the palatal stop (segment loss compensation). There are other cases where diphthongization compensates for the loss of point of articulation features (property loss compensation) as in ('year') vs. ('years').\n\nThe dialectal distribution of compensatory diphthongization is almost entirely dependent on the dorsal stop () and the extent of consonant assimilation (whether or not it is extended to palatals).\n\nVoiced affricates are devoiced after stressed vowels in dialects like Eastern Catalan where there may be a correlation between devoicing and lengthening (gemination) of voiced affricates: → ('medic'). In Barcelona, voiced stops may be fortified (geminated and devoiced); e.g. 'village').\n\nCatalan denti-alveolar stops can fully assimilate to the following consonant, producing gemination; this is particularly evident before nasal and lateral consonants: e.g. ('rind'), / ('spring'), and ('week'). Learned words can alternate between featuring and not featuring such assimilation (e.g. 'atlas', 'to administer').\n\nCentral Valencian features simple elision in many of these cases (e.g , ) though learned words don't exhibit either assimilation or elision: and .\n\nStress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word (e.g. 'compass', 'punishment', 'fool').\n\nCompound words and adverbs formed with may have more than one stressed syllable (e.g. 'willingly'; 'lightning conductor') but every lexical word has just one stressed syllable.\n\nAny consonant, as well as and may be an onset. Clusters may consist of a consonant plus a semivowel (C, C) or an obstruent plus a liquid. Some speakers may have one of these obstruent-plus-liquid clusters preceding a semivowel, e.g. ('watermelon'); for other speakers, this is pronounced (i.e. the semivowel must be syllabic in this context).\n\nWord-medial codas are restricted to one consonant + ( ). In the coda position, voice contrasts among obstruents are neutralized. Although there are exceptions (such as 'future'), syllable-final rhotics are often lost before a word boundary or before the plural morpheme of most words: ('color') vs. ('bright color').\n\nIn Central Eastern Catalan, obstruents fail to surface word-finally when preceded by a homorganic consonant (e.g. ). Complex codas simplify only if the loss of the segment doesn't result in the loss of place specification.\n\nWhen the suffix is added to it makes , indicating that the underlying representation is || (with subsequent cluster simplification), however when the copula is added it makes . The resulting generalization is that this underlying will only surface in a morphologically complex word. Despite this, word-final codas are not usually simplified in most of Balearic and Valencian (e.g. ).\n\nWord-initial clusters from Graeco-Latin learned words tend to drop the first phoneme: ('pneumatic'), ('pseudonym'), ('pterodactylus'), ('gnome').\n\nWord-final obstruents are devoiced, however they assimilate voicing of the following consonant; e.g. ('silkworm'). In regular and fast speech, stops often assimilate the place of articulation of the following consonant producing phonetic gemination: ('all good').\n\nWord-final fricatives (except ) are voiced before a following vowel; e.g. ('huge bus').\n\nIn Majorcan and Minorcan Catalan, undergoes total assimilation to a following consonant (just as stops do): ('large puff').\n\nThe differences in the vocalic systems outlined above are the main criteria used to differentiate between the major dialects:\n\nRegarding consonants, betacism and fricative–affricate alternations are the most prominent differences between dialects.\n\nOther dialectal features are:\n\nCatalan shares features with neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, Italian, Sardinian, French, Spanish).\n\n\nIn contrast with other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters. Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like ('male friend') vs. ('female friend').\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39412522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39412522", "title": "Comprehension of idioms", "text": "Comprehension of idioms\n\nComprehension of idioms is the act of processing and understanding idioms. Idioms are a common type of figure of speech. Based on common linguistic definitions, an idiom is a combination of words that contains a meaning that cannot be understood based on the literal definition of the individual words. An example of an idiom is \"hit the sack\", which means \"to go to bed\". It can be used in a sentence like the following: \"I'm so exhausted that I'm going to hit the sack now\".\n\nTraditionally, idiom comprehension was thought to require a distinct processing mode other than literal language comprehension. Subsequent research suggested that the comprehension of idioms could be explained in the context of general models of comprehension. Contemporary researchers have also posited that different modes of processing are required for distinct types of idioms. Factors, such as idiom familiarity, transparency, and context are found to influence idiom comprehension. \n\nRecent neurolinguistic research has found, using various techniques, several neural substrates that are associated with idiom comprehension, such as the left temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex.\n\nPsycholinguistic research in idiom comprehension began in the 1970s. Early research on figurative language typically assumed that comprehending figurative and literal language involved different kinds of processes. The non-compositional models of idiom comprehension were constructed based on this assumption. \n\nNon-compositional models in general assume that idioms are stored like long words in memory. For example, the entire phrase \"kick the bucket\" is represented by the meaning \"to die\". The words kick and bucket separately do not contribute to the idiomatic meaning. Since individual words do not matter in an idiomatic expression, they are thought to be processed together as one entity during comprehension. In contrast, processing a literal expression requires the meaning of each word to be derived and then perceived in relation to the other words in the phrase. Non-compositional models include the \"literal first hypothesis\", \"lexical representation hypothesis\", and the \"direct access hypothesis\". \n\nThe Literal First Hypothesis \n\n\nThe Lexical Representation Hypothesis\n\n\nThe Direct Access Hypothesis\n\n\nThere are several criticisms for the non-compositional models. \"First\", studies demonstrated that idiom expressions are not processed more slowly than literal expression. In fact, it is often the opposite, which is in contrary to the prediction of literal first hypothesis. \"Second\", idioms have been found to be more than just “frozen phrases” or long words. For example, some idioms can be transformed to some extent and still be recognized and understood. For example, \"spill the beans\" can be used as “the beans were spilt by Mary”. This is possible because \"spill the bean\" can be mapped on the meaning “reveal the secret”, i.e. \"spill\" (reveal) and \"beans\" (secret). Such idiom shows that the internal structure of the word string matters during comprehension. The meaning of some idioms, like \"play with fire\", can be also inferred from literal interpretation of their components (i.e. \"to do something dangerous\"). These findings reveal that idioms are not a homogeneous, distinct group and thus may not involve different processing strategies from those for literal expressions.\n\nCompositional models assume that idiom comprehension uses normal language processing. When an idiomatic expression is encountered, it is processed incrementally like a normal expression. Components of an idiomatic word string contribute to a figurative meaning in either a literal or metaphorical way. Compositional models include the \"configurational hypothesis\" and the \"conceptual metaphor hypothesis\". \n\nThe Configurational Hypothesis\n\n\nThe Conceptual Metaphor Hypothesis\n\n\nThe prediction of the configurational hypothesis was not supported by research findings. Researchers found that even after a word string is recognized as an idiom, its literal meaning is still activated. Another criticism of the compositional models concerns the role of familiarity in idiom comprehension. As discovered by research on non-compositional models, idiomatic expressions are processed faster than non-idiomatic expressions. This is likely due to people’s familiarity of idioms. This suggests that when highly familiar idioms are encountered, people may not need to engage in literal processing or utilize conceptual metaphor to infer their meanings.\n\nResearch in idiom comprehension continues today. Non-compositional and compositional models both inform contemporary researchers. One of the recent models includes the dual idiom representation model.\n\nThe Dual Idiom Representation Model\n\n\nMany factors have an effect on the comprehension of idioms. They can influence the processing speed and understandability of the idioms. Some of these factors include the familiarity, transparency, and context of use of the idioms.\n\nIdiom familiarity is typically defined as how frequently an idiom is encountered in a language community. Subjective ratings of idiom familiarity are usually obtained from members of the language community. An example of a more familiar English idiom is \"pain in the neck\", while a less familiar idiom is \"paddle his own canoe\". Research demonstrated that familiar idioms are processed quicker and more accurately than unfamiliar ones. As the dual idiom representation model suggests, highly familiar idioms may lead to direct memory retrieval. Processing unfamiliar idioms, on the other head, requires contextual information and commonsense knowledge.\n\nIdiom transparency can refer to the “literalness” of an idiom; how easy it is to understand an idiom based on the words it contains. Idioms can be sorted depending on their degree of transparency. Three categories of idioms have been identified: \"decomposable\", \"abnormally decomposable\", and \"nondecomposable\". Decomposable idioms are composed of words that literally contribute to their overall figurative meaning, e.g. \"pop the question\". \"Pop\" refers to \"sudden\" and \"the question\" refers to \"marriage proposal\". Abnormally decomposable idioms contain words that are associated with the overall figurative meaning of the idiom but in a metaphorical way, e.g. \"spill the beans\". \"Spill\" mapping on to \"reveal\" and \"beans\" metaphorically representing \"secret\". Nondecomposable idioms are made of words that do not reflect their idiomatic meaning, e.g. \"kick the bucket\". People are found to respond to both types of decomposable idioms faster than nondecomposable ones.\n\nResearch in children highlighted the important effects of context on idiom comprehension. It was found that children understand idiomatic expression more accurately when they are shown in informative contexts than when they are presented in isolation. When they are encountered out of context, children tended to interpret idioms literally. The ability to use contextual information in language processing has also been found to influence children’s performance in idiom comprehension. Adults, however, are more affected by the familiarity of the idiom.\n\nResearchers have used various means to explore the brain regions that are associated with idiom comprehension. The investigations involve examining brain damage patients, and conducting transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Brain damages in the patients were mostly caused by strokes or traumatic accidents. rTMS causes temporary cerebral lesion, and thereby impairs the target area’s functioning. fMRI measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. The areas that have been studied include the right hemisphere, left hemisphere, and prefrontal cortex.\n\nSince aphasic patients often preserve their ability to use familiar phrases (i.e. idioms and proverbs), researchers hypothesized that they may be stored and processed in different brain regions than novel phrases. It was found that patients who experienced right-brain damage (RBD) showed more impairment in idiom comprehension than patients with left-brain damage (LBD). RBD patients however performed better in comprehending novel sentence compared to patients with LBD. This suggests that the right hemisphere is involved in the comprehension of idioms. However, later research has suggested that RBD patients’ difficulties in idiom comprehension, as demonstrated by sentence-to-picture matching task, may be due to deficits in their visuospatial abilities, rather than impairment in linguistic processing. The right hemisphere shows dominance in visuospatial processing.\n\nOther researchers have hypothesized that comprehension of nondecomposable idioms mainly involved left hemispheric activity. When healthy adults were studied, left temporal rTMS was found to influence the reaction time and accuracy of both idiom comprehension and literal sentence processing. In particular, it increased processing time and reduced accuracy in understanding. When rTMS was applied to the left frontal, right frontal and right temporal, there were no effects on idiom comprehension. Recent research with healthy adults using fMRI also found that, when processing idioms that were not literally interpretable (i.e., \"raining cats and dogs\"), the Broca’s area in the left prefronto-temporal network was activated. However, when literally interpretable idioms (i.e., \"break the ice\") were processed, the left medial frontal gyrus (MFQ) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) were activated.\n\nPrefrontal cortex (PFC) is suggested to be important for idiom comprehension. It may play a role in selecting the appropriate interpretation and suppressing the incorrect ones when an idiomatic expression is encountered. Research using fMRI indicated that the left temporal cortex, left superior medial frontal gyrus, and left inferior frontal gyrus were activated when idiomatic phrases were presented. In addition, the right superior and middle temporal gyri, the right temporal pole, and the right inferior frontal gyrus were activated as well. In contrast, the left inferior parietal lobe and the right supramarginal gyrus were activated when literal sentences were presented.\n\nFuture research in this field should continue to investigate which brain regions are associated with idiom processing, in order to resolve the ongoing debate on hemispheric specialization in figurative language comprehension. A recent review suggested that the familiarity affect which brain region is activated during the comprehension of figurative language. Less familiar expressions are suggested to be processed in the right hemisphere, while more familiar ones are processed predominately in the left hemisphere. More brain imaging research needs to be conducted to test this hypothesis. \n\nAdditionally, future research could use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to explore the temporal dynamics of idiom comprehension. Recent research using MEG has found that, when idioms containing action verbs (i.e. \"kick the bucket\") were processed, motor regions of the brain were activated. The anterior fronto-temporal cortex, a region previously found to distinguish between literal and figurative processing, was activated at the same time as well. This suggests that literal and figurative meanings are processed in parallel to some extent, which gives support to the configurational hypothesis. More work with MEG should be done to verify these findings.\n\n"}

This produces a viewpoint akin to tilting one's head to the side.\n\nIn cinematography, the Dutch angle is one of many cinematic techniques often used to portray psychological uneasiness or tension in the subject being filmed.\n\nDutch refers to a bastardisation of the word \"Deutsch\", the German word for \"German\". It is not related to the Dutch people or language. It originated in the First World War, as Navy blockades made the import (and export) of movies impossible. The German movie scene was part of the expressionist movement, which used the Dutch angle extensively.\n\nA Dutch angle is a camera shot in which the camera has been rotated relative to the horizon or vertical lines in the shot. The primary use of such angles is to cause a sense of unease or disorientation for the viewer. Many Dutch angles are static shots, but in a moving Dutch angle shot the camera can pivot, pan or track along the established diagonal axis for the shot. \n\nDziga Vertov's 1929 experimental documentary \"Man with a Movie Camera\" contains uses of the Dutch angle, among other innovative techniques discovered by Vertov himself.\n\nThe angle was widely used to depict madness, unrest, exoticism, and disorientation in German Expressionism, hence its name \"Deutsch\", meaning German, was often conflated with the etymologically similar word Dutch which gives the corruption of the term now commonly used. Montages of Dutch angles are often structured such that the tilts are horizontally opposed in each shot – for example, a right-tilted shot will be followed with a left-tilted shot, and so on.\n\nThe 1949 film \"The Third Man\" makes extensive use of Dutch angle shots, to emphasize the main character's alienation in a foreign environment. Director Carol Reed has said that William Wyler gifted him with a spirit level after seeing the film, to sardonically encourage him to use more traditional shooting angles.\n\nDutch angles were used extensively in the 1960s \"Batman\" TV series and 1966 film, satires in which each villain had his or her own angle, as they were \"crooked\".\n\nDutch angles are frequently used by film directors who have a background in the visual arts, such as Tim Burton (in \"Edward Scissorhands\" and \"Ed Wood\"), and Terry Gilliam (in \"Brazil\", \"The Fisher King\", \"12 Monkeys\", \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" and \"Tideland\") to represent madness, disorientation, or drug psychosis. In his \"Evil Dead\" trilogy, Sam Raimi used Dutch angles to show that a character had become possessed.\n\nThe Dutch angle is an overt cinematographical technique that can be overused. The science-fiction film \"Battlefield Earth\" (2000), in particular, drew sharp criticism for its pervasive use of the Dutch angle. In the words of film critic Roger Ebert, \"the director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why\".\n\nDutch angles are often used in horror video games, particularly those with static camera angles such as early entries in the \"Resident Evil\" and \"Silent Hill\" franchises. Similar to their use in movies, these angles are used to bring about a feeling of unease in the player.\n\n"}

Sampson explains the original title of the book as a deliberate allusion to \"Educating Rita\" (1980), and uses the plot of that play to illustrate his argument. Sampson's book is a response to Steven Pinker's \"The Language Instinct\" specifically and Chomskyan linguistic nativism broadly.\n\nThe title, \"Educating Eve\", was dropped after the first edition because the allusion to \"Educating Rita\" \"was deemed unduly mysterious\". The revised edition (2005) contains an additional chapter and \"many passages, from a few words up to new chapter-sections, that discuss relevant scientific findings which have emerged since the first edition, or respond to objections made by critics of that edition.\"\n\nSampson critically evaluates the ability of theories of linguistic nativism to accommodate the growing understanding of human brain processing over the course of the late 20th century. He proposes an alternative explanation, borrowing some ideas and terminology from Karl Popper.\n\n\nThe book has seven chapters introduced by a foreword by Paul Postal who claims an agnostic position regarding the debate. He expresses serious concerns regarding the strength of the \"nativist\" argument; but despite being unconvinced of the alternative view, he commends Sampson for challenging nativism and attempting to make a case for an alternative.\n\nThe first chapter of \"Educating Eve\" considers broad contours of the nature versus nurture debate in regard to human knowledge generally, before narrowing this down to the rise of late 20th century linguistic nativism in particular. It concludes with an overview of the methodology of the rest of the book. Chapter 2 reports evidence that was available to the \"first wave\" of nativists (like Chomsky) during the 1960s and 1970s. Chapter 3 reports the results of research that have become available since then. Chapter 4 turns to examining the distinctive arguments of \"new wave\" nativists (like Pinker). Chapter 5 presents a case for an alternative view.\nIn chapter 7 Sampson concludes with a short personal perspective on sociological changes in the nature of academic discourse over the 40 years of the debate regarding nativism. He attributes the popularity of nativism to various features of these sociological changes.\n\n\nCowley, and some others, view Sampson and Pinker as standing at extreme ends of a nature–nurture spectrum, as applied to explaining language acquisition. Cowley notes philosophical difficulties with each extreme, as they are argued by Sampson and Pinker: Sampson's version of the nurture position also argues for philosophical dualism; whereas Pinker's version of the nature position also argues for an ontological reality for syntax. Both these auxiliary arguments are unsatisfactory to many writers who address the relevant broader philosophical questions.\n\nCowley proposes an alternative: that language acquisition involves culturally determined language skills, apprehended by a biologically determined faculty that responds to them. In other words, he proposes that each extreme is right in what it affirms, but wrong in what it denies. \"Both\" cultural diversity of language, and a learning instinct, can be affirmed; \"neither\" need be denied.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3365023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3365023", "title": "Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet", "text": "Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet\n\nThe extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet, also extIPA symbols for disordered speech or simply extIPA (), are a set of letters and diacritics devised by the International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association to augment the International Phonetic Alphabet for the phonetic transcription of disordered speech. Some of the symbols are occasionally used for transcribing features of normal speech.\n\nMany sounds found only in disordered speech are indicated with diacritics, though an increasing number of dedicated letters are used as well. Special letters are included to transcribe the speech of people with lisps and cleft palates. The extIPA repeats several standard-IPA diacritics that are unfamiliar to most people but transcribe features that are common in disordered speech. These include preaspiration , linguolabial , laminal fricatives and for a sound (segment or feature) with no available symbol (letter or diacritic). The novel transcription is used for an English molar-r, as opposed to for an apical r; these articulations are indistinguishable in sound and so are rarely identified in non-disordered speech.\n\nSounds not found in non-disordered speech include fricative nasals (a.k.a. nareal fricatives) and percussive consonants. Sounds sometimes found in the world's languages that do not have symbols in the IPA include denasals and fricatives that are simultaneously lateral and sibilant.\n\nThe full letters added by the extIPA are the following:\n\nThe symbol is used with the alveolar click for , an alveolar click with percussive release, a \"cluck\".\n\nVoQS letters may also be used, as in for a \"buccal interdental trill\" (a raspberry).\n\nThe extIPA has widened the use of some of the regular IPA symbols, such as for pre-aspiration, or for uvularization, as well as adding some new ones. Some of the extIPA diacritics are occasionally used for non-disordered speech, for example for the unusual airstream mechanisms of Damin.\n\nOne modification is the use of subscript parentheses around the phonation diacritics to indicate partial phonation; a single parenthesis at the left or right of the voicing indicates that it is partially phonated at the beginning or end of the segment. These conventions may be convenient for representing various voice onset times. Phonation diacritics may also be prefixed or suffixed rather than placed directly under the segment to represent relative timing.\n\nThe transcriptions for partial voicing and devoicing may be used in either the sense of degrees of voicing or in the sense that the voicing is discontinuous. For the former, both parentheses indicate the sound is mildly (partially) voiced throughout, and single parentheses mean a partial degree of voicing at the beginning or end of the sound. \nFor the latter, both parentheses mean the sound is (de)voiced in the middle, while the single parentheses mean complete (de)voicing at the beginning or end of the sound.\n\nAltering the position of a diacritic relative to the letter indicates that the phonation begins before the consonant or vowel does or continues beyond it. The voiceless ring and other phonation diacritics can be used in the same way if needed. For example, indicates that voicelessness continues past the , equivalent to .\n\nOther extIPA diacritics are:\n\nDiacritics may be placed within parentheses as the voicing diacritics are above. For example, with parentheses around the diacritic indicates a \"partially\" denasalized [m]. \n\nFollowing a longstanding tradition of the IPA not found on the IPA chart, any IPA or extIPA letter may be used as a superscript diacritic to indicate the onset or release of another letter. For example, for with a lateral-fricative release (similar to the velar lateral affricate , but with less frication), or for with lateral plus central release. Combining diacritics can be added to superscript diacritics, such as for with bidental aspiration. \n\nThe VoQS voice-quality symbols take IPA and extended-IPA diacritics, as well as several additional diacritics that are potentially available for the extIPA. At least the subscript dot for 'whisper' is sometimes found in IPA transcription, though that diacritic is also commonly used for apical-retroflex articulation.\n\nThe Extended IPA has adopted bracket notation from conventions transcribing discourse. Parentheses are used to indicate \"mouthing\" (silent articulation), as in , a silent sign to hush. Parentheses are also used to indicate silent pauses, for example (...). Double parentheses indicate extraneous, obscured or unintelligible sound, as in ((2 syll.)), two audible but unidentifiable syllables. An empty circle, ◯, is used for an indeterminate segment; capital Ⓒ is identified only as a consonant, capital Ⓕ as a fricative, IPA ⓟ as \"probably\" a , etc. Curly brackets with Italian musical terms are used for phonation and prosodic notation, such as and terms for the tempo and dynamics of connected speech. These are subscripted within a {curly brace} notation to indicate that they are comments on the intervening text.\n\nThe VoQS conventions use similar notation for voice quality.\n\nThree rows appear in the extIPA chart that do not occur in the IPA chart: \"fricative lateral + median\" (simultaneous grooved and lateral frication), \"fricative nasal\" (a.k.a. nareal fricative) and \"percussive\". A denasal row is added here. Several new columns appear as well, though the linguolabial column is the result of a standard-IPA diacritic. \n\n\n"}

Castañeda received his Ph.D. in June 1954 for his dissertation \"The Logical Structure of Moral Reasoning\". He studied at Oxford University from 1955–1956, after which he once again returned to the US to take a sabbatical-replacement position in philosophy at Duke University. Castañeda is noted for his development of Guise theory, which he applied to outstanding problems in the analysis of thought, language, and the structure of the world. He is also credited with the discovery of the \"quasi-indicator\" or \"quasi-indexical\", a linguistic device by which one person can attribute an indexical reference to another. His discussion on this matter strongly influenced John Perry's theory of indexicals, an influence which Perry acknowledged in the first footnote of the paper \"The Problem of the Essential Indexical\".\n\nHe died of a brain tumor in 1991.\n\nFollowing his brief stay at Duke University, Castañeda's first full-time academic appointment was as a professor in the Philosophy department at Wayne State University, where he taught from 1957–1969. It was there that he founded the philosophical journal \"Noûs\", in 1967. From 1962–1963, he was also a visiting professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He was granted a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation between 1967 and 1968.\n\nHe moved to Indiana University in 1969, and eventually became the Mahlon Powell Professor of Philosophy as well as that university's first Dean of Latino Affairs, a position he held from 1978–1981. He was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences from 1981–1982.\n\nIn addition to his other academic honors, Castañeda received grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the National Science Foundation. He served as President of the American Philosophical Association Central Division from 1979–1980, and was named to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990. Castañeda was awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor by the Government of Guatemala in 1991.\n\nCastañeda started from the fact that thoughts about real things in the world are of a fundamentally similar nature to thoughts about things in the imagination, it is still a thought, and from there he hypothesized an entire realm of abstract objects that included both the real and the imagined. He referred to these objects collectively as \"guises\", and argued that they could be treated as sets of properties. He went on to analyse all of language and perception in terms of these guises, ultimately developing an entire metaphysics based on them.\n\nOne noted critic of Guise theory was Plantinga, who developed his own rival theory involving a realm of abstract objects. Both theories were in fact based on even earlier work developed by Ernst Mally in 1912. They differed, however, in the details of their metaphysical system and in how they regarded the basic building blocks of their respective systems.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46531067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46531067", "title": "Identification in rhetoric", "text": "Identification in rhetoric\n\nContemporary rhetoric focuses on cultural contexts and general structures of rhetoric structures. Kenneth Burke is one of the most notable contemporary U.S. rhetoricians who made major contributions to the rhetoric of identification. One of his most foundational ideas is as follows, “rhetoric makes human unity possible, that language use is symbolic action, and that rhetoric is symbolic inducement.” Branching from this, Herrick states that identification in rhetoric is crucial to persuasion, and thus to cooperation, consensus, compromise, and action. Burke believed that the most serious human problem was to be alienated or separated, and rhetoric was to be that problem’s only solution. Much of his work was based on bringing people back together. “Identification is affirmed with earnestness precisely because there is division. Identification is compensatory to division.” Rhetoric’s goal, in regards to identification, is to bring people together of whom have been separated by estrangement or opposition.\n\nKenneth Burke plays an important part in learning and understanding the core values of rhetorical theory in identification. He introduces the notion by taking the Aristotelian approach into a \"world of particulars.\" Burke states that Aristotle treated rhetoric as purely verbal. But there are also areas of overlap. The flexibility of identification that Burke has created expands into elements beyond language. Burke wrote that “identification ranges from the politician who, addressing an audience of farmers, says, ‘I was a farm boy myself,’ through the mysteries of social status, to the mystic’s devout identification with the source of all being.” This symbolic interaction is possible because it recognizes the hidden sources of identification among human beings as symbol users. From this, Burke understands symbols as something that is around constantly, and that choosing to accept and learning to read them accurately is what needs to be understood.\n\nBurke’s theory of identification has been applied and expanded upon in Krista Ratcliffe’s Rhetorical Listening Framework. Ratcliffe proposes the “blurring of Burke’s and Fuss’s theories of identification, what becomes visible is multiple places for rhetorical listening. When applying Burke and Fuss’s theories, Ratcliffe proposes non-identification in cross-cultural communication and feminist pedagogy. Her critique of Western logic is that it is difficult to simultaneously pay attention to both commonalities and differences, but that is where non-identification exists and thus provides a place for rhetorical listening. Burke’s theory is critiqued by Ratcliffe for only focusing on identification; she argues that rhetorical listeners need to be accountable and take into consideration different points of view, which can be done through simultaneous listening to commonalities and differences.\n\nRatcliffe draws upon Diane Fuss because Fuss expands Burke’s theory of identification to gear toward examining the differences in identificaion. Fuss defines Identification as related to the issue of connection between opposite entities, such as the interrelation between self and other, subject and object, and insiders and outsiders. For Fuss, identification is difficult to pinpoint, as the distinction between opposite entities is porous, oftentimes “impossibly confused and finally untenable.” Fuss further builds the connection between identification and disidentification. Fuss defines disidentification as contingent on previous identification with another group, no matter how stereotypical the identification is, while at the same time the identification has receded from the subconscious. Ratcliffe argues that previously identification has been configured as a metaphor, which is manifested in Burke’s consubstantiality and Fuss’s (dis)identification. Ratcliffe notes that metaphor has been used to function as the dominant trope for identification; however, metaphor foregrounds commonalities more than differences. Ratcliff suggests theorizing identification via the use of metonymy to counter the privilege of communality. Intrinsic to the trope of metonymy is an attention to both commonalities and differences.\n\nPractical applications of Burke’s “identification” can be seen in the scholarly effort to reframe identifications. Assembling essays from the fifth Biennial Rhetoric Society of America Conference, Michelle Ballif addresses Ratcliffe’s call for rethinking Burke’s notion of identification “as a place of perpetual reframing that affects who, how, and what can be thought, spoken, written, and imagined.” While some of the essay contributors draw upon Burke’s theory to reinterpret social identifications, others turn to specific social actions to reread Burke’s “identification.” For instance, following Ratcliffe’s critique of Burke’s theory for its lack of attention to difference, Dominic J. Ashby destabilizes Burke’s relatively fixed and teleological construction of identification with “a fluid and contingent notion of self”—that is, “uchi/soto,\" or inside/outside in Japanese rhetoric—highlighting a simultaneous exclusion and inclusion of outsiders through an ongoing unfolding of group dynamics. By way of analyzing the Facebook news feed of “We are all Khaled Said,” Katherine Bridgman expands Burkean identification to “embodiment,” or the mutually coordinated experience between speakers and their audiences triggered by specific circumstances. Along a similar vein, critiquing Burke’s consubstantiality for being sexually indifferent, Janice Odom draws from Irigaray’s feminist theories to reframe identification as a playground of sexual dominance and surrender.\n\n"}

Various other languages have co-official or recognised status in specific territories, and a number of unofficial languages and dialects are spoken in certain localities.\n\nIn terms of the number of speakers and dominance, the most prominent of the languages of Spain is Spanish (Castilian), spoken by about 99% of Spaniards as a first or second language. Catalan (or Valencian) is spoken by 19%, Galician by 5%, and Basque by 2% of the population.\n\nDistribution of the regional co-official languages in Spain:\n\nSpanish is official throughout the country; the rest of these languages have legal and co-official status in their respective communities, and (except Aranese) are widespread enough to have daily newspapers and significant book publishing and media presence in those communities. In the cases of Catalan and Galician, they are the main languages used by the Catalan and Galician regional governments and local administrations. A number of citizens in these areas consider their regional language as their primary language and Spanish as secondary.\n\nIn addition to these, there are a number of seriously endangered and recognised minority languages:\n\nSpanish itself also has distinct dialects around the country; for example, the Andalusian or Canarian dialects, each of these with their own subvarieties, some of them being partially closer to the Spanish of the Americas, which they heavily influenced at different degrees, depending on the regions or periods, and according to different and non-homogeneous migrating or colonisation processes.\n\nFive very localised dialects are of difficult filiation: Fala, a nearly extinct variety of its own mostly adscribed to the Galician-Portuguese group; Cantabrian and Extremaduran, two Astur-Leonese dialects also regarded as Spanish dialects; Eonavian, a dialect between Asturian and Galician, closer to the latter according to several linguists; and Benasquese, a Ribagorçan dialect that was formerly classified as Catalan, later as Aragonese, and which is now often regarded as a transitional language of its own. Asturian and Leonese are closely related to the local Mirandese which is spoken on an adjacent territory but over the border into Portugal. Mirandese is recognised and has some local official status.\n\nWith the exception of Basque, which appears to be a language isolate, all of the languages present in mainland Spain are Indo-European languages, specifically Romance languages.\n\nAfro-Asiatic languages, such as Arabic (including Ceuta Darija) or Berber (mainly Riffian), are spoken by the Muslim population of Ceuta and Melilla and by recent immigrants (mainly from Morocco and Algeria) elsewhere.\n\nIn Galicia, the mutual relationship between Galician and Portuguese has caused some controversy, since some linguists, such as Lindley Cintra, consider that they are still dialects of a common language, in spite of the differences in phonology and vocabulary (see reintegrationism).\n\nOthers, such as Pilar Vázquez Cuesta, argue that they have become separate languages due to major differences in phonetics and vocabulary usage, and, to a lesser extent, morphology and syntax.\n\nIn any case, the respective written standards are noticeably different one from another, partly because of the divergent phonological features and partly due to the usage of Spanish orthographic conventions over the Portuguese ones at the time of Galician standardisation by the early 20th century.\n\nThe official (delegated onto both the and the Royal Galician Academy standard) and widespread position is that Galician and Portuguese should be considered independent languages.\n\nA Galician-Portuguese-based dialect known as Fala is locally spoken in an area sometimes called \"Valley of Jálama/Xálima\", which includes the towns of San Martín de Trevejo (\"Sa Martin de Trevellu\"), Eljas (\"As Elhas\") and Valverde del Fresno (\"Valverdi du Fresnu\"), in the northwestern corner of Cáceres province, Extremadura.\n\nPortuguese proper is still spoken by local people in three border areas:\n\nIn addition to the languages which continue to be spoken in Spain to the present day, other languages which have been spoken within what are now the borders of Spain include:\n\nLanguages that are now chiefly spoken outside Spain but which have roots in Spain are:\n\n\nThere are also variants of these languages proper to Spain, either dialect, cants or pidgins:\n\n\n\n"}

Mean world syndrome is one of the main conclusions of cultivation theory. Gerbner, a pioneer researcher on the effects of television on society, argued that people who watch television tended to think of the world as an intimidating and unforgiving place. A direct correlation between the amount of television one watches and the amount of fear one harbors about the world has been proven, although the direction of causality remains debatable in that persons fearful of the world may be more likely to retreat from it and in turn spend more time with indoor, solitary activities such as television watching.\n\nThe number of opinions, images, and attitudes that viewers tend to form when watching television will have a direct influence on how the viewer perceives the real world. They will reflect and refer to the most common images or recurrent messages thought to affect their own real lives. Gerbner once said: \"You know, who tells the stories of a culture really governs human behaviour. It used to be the parent, the school, the church, the community.

This theory is most commonly associated with the cognitive neuroscientist and neuroanthropologist Merlin Donald, who developed the idea in his 1991 book \"Origins of the Modern Mind\" as the fundamental pillar in his three-part model of the development of symbolic culture and symbolic cognition.\n\nThe mimetic theory of development was the central pillar in Donald's three-part model of symbolic cognition proposed in his 1991 book \"Origins of the Modern Mind\".\n\n\"Origins of the Modern Mind\" proposes a three-stage development of human symbolic capacity through culture:\n\nMimetic culture: The watershed adaptation allowing humans to function as symbolic and cultural beings was a revolutionary improvement in motor control, the \"mimetic skill\" required to rehearse and refine the body's movements in a voluntary and systematic way, to remember those rehearsals, and to reproduce them on command. Following this development, Homo erectus assimilated and reconceptualized events to create various prelinguistic symbolic traditions such as rituals, dance, and craft.\n\nMythic cultures arose as a result of the acquisition of speech and the invention of symbols. Mimetic representation serves as a preadaptation to this development.\n\nTechnology-supported culture: Finally, the cognitive ecology dominated by ephemeral face-to-face communication has changed for most of us as a result of the external memory-store that reading and writing permit. Computer technology intensifies these changes by offering even more extensive capacities for external storage and retrieval of information.\"\n\nDonald argues for a periodic development of the human mind, a lineage in which the progression of the hominid brain, and the emergence of social culture, can be tracked through a primarily four-phase process of development in memory and social-cognitive systems that left humans with the cognitive infrastructure that we still retain today. Donald begins with the development of episodic memory in primates, and traces how the evolutionary lineage of the brain brought about next a mimetic culture, based on pantomiming and simplistic vocalizations to convey intentionality, and then a mythic culture, which used simplistic forms of story-sharing to form the basis of the first hominids trying to model their environment, its origins, and their place within it, and finally to a theoretic culture, which had the capability for higher orders of cognitive-processing, and whom eventually developed language.\n\nDonald’s theory of the evolution of the human mind with mimesis at the core of things is very dependent on a lineage that is highly period-based, likely as a means to help explain some of the contradictory gaps in the archaeological record, where tool use, cultural artifacts, mastery of fire, and brain size (based on skulls that have been found) seem to either conflict, or have missing steps in their development. Donald sees this progression taking place in a very linear way, and his logic behind this makes sense. For example, the concept of mimetic minds makes intuitive sense- an episodic memory certainly had to be in place before an intentional communication system of any capacity could be implemented, but it also seems highly unlikely that hominids went straight from the ability to remember and mentally manipulate certain events to the ability to speak; after all, one would have little use for language- let alone an evolutionary reason to develop it- without first developing a concrete sense of personal intentionality, along with the capacity to communicate this intentional stance to others, and with the reciprocal action of understanding their intentional stance as well.\n\nIt seems unlikely that the development of the mind occurred in such linear periods as Donald describes them; new evidence that has emerged since the publication of Donald’s book, primarily the discovery of mirror neurons, has laid the groundwork for a potentially more fluid, less periodic theory of the evolution of the mind.\n\nMirror neurons are a class of cells that have been found in the brains of several species of monkey, as well as in humans. Small clusters of mirror neurons tend to fire when an individual performs a given intentional action; this, however, is not the unique part. What is unique to mirror neurons is that a few of them in a cluster will also fire when an individual watches a different individual performing an intentional action. In other words, these neurons are influencing your ability for social learning. Because the same neurons are firing both when you perform an action and when you watch someone else rehearse that same action, the mind has obtained a method by which it can link itself to conspecific minds in order to share knowledge, culture, and judge the intentional stance of a potential friend or foe.\n\nThe existence of these neurons should likely trace their roots back closer to a common ancestor with modern primates, the only other species noted with mirror neurons, and some of the intentional and mimetic capabilities that Donald attributes to the evolution of the mimetic mind in Homo Erectus were likely around much earlier in some simplified form, perhaps as the foundation of the rigid social hierarchies that our primate cousins are known for.\n\nIndeed, evidence exists that perhaps monkeys are even better at some aspects of the social cognition game than humans are. Colin Camerer, a behavioral economist at the California Institute of Technology, has conducted studies on monkeys using strategic games, where the outcomes can be quantitatively assessed against results from game theory, an applied branch of mathematics and economics which dictates rational choices and optimal outcomes, such as Nash Equilibriums, in games of strategy between two or more opponents. Amazingly, when pairs of chimps and pairs of humans were pitted against each other in a strategic pattern matching game, the outcomes for pairs of chimps clustered much more closely to the Nash Equilibrium and other mathematically-efficient outcomes than the outcomes for pairs of humans did.\n\nPerhaps even more interesting is that when the researchers shifted the reward incentive more in favor of one party versus the other- and so also shifting where the efficient equilibrium points should fall- the chimps not only altered their behavior accordingly, they once again clustered more closely around the new mathematical equilibriums than human pairs did. Camerer posits that this is likely attributable to the importance of social hierarchy and role in chimpanzees, where the ability to strategize into a position of best outcome given the circumstance (or the chance to manipulate another chimpanzee’s strategic mistake to maximize one’s own gain) is an incredibly valuable skill.\n\nThis seems to be a probable explanation for the unlikely capability of monkeys to have such a finely attuned social sense that their behavior can be described by formal mathematical equilibriums; unfortunately, it does not bode well for Donald’s theory of a period of mimetic mind and culture development during the Erectus period of Homo lineage. Chimps in these experiments have shown signs of intentionality, communicativity, reference, modeling of social structure, reciprocal mimetic games, and conformity and coordination, all tenets of mimetic minds and mimetic cultures in Donald’s model, but all certainly having roots in ancestry from before Donald’s proposed mimetic period. Additionally, the chimpanzees must have at least a crude form of mental representations: the chimpanzees shifting to a new equilibrium when reward incentives were altered seems to undoubtedly indicate that they are aware of themselves and another chimp in a mutually-interactive environment, in which an abstract activity leads to a variable reward, a degree of strategy that requires at least some basic information to be held in the mind and manipulated.\n\nFurthermore, many of these capabilities formed the basis of the progression into unique-to-human features of the mind developing in Donald’s model. For example, this mimetic behavior must be preceded first by an episodic memory capable of handling mental manipulations; the combination of this memory system with the acquisition and development of skills like intentionality and mimesis should then be sufficient with the proper pressures to allow for skills like tool-making, ritual dance, and pedagogy. And yet primates have evolved alongside us for millions of years without developing tools, dance, or any significant means of information transfer and teaching, despite certainly having an episodic memory, and presumably having some sort of social mirroring neurons that allowed them to develop such a complex social hierarchy, as well as display basic levels of intentionality, communicativity, and coordination.\n\nThus, the divergence of cognitive capacities between humans and lower hominids may not be due so much to mimetic culture as it is due to some mutation that increased that plasticity in our brains around the time of Homo Erectus, perhaps in part related to the mastery of fire during this period, which would have allowed for cooking and the ability to ingest enough quality nutrition to give our brains the resources to make its final push into its modern stage of development. This increase in plasticity would certainly be a mutation or upgrade supported by natural selection; a brain that can learn faster, more efficiently, and calibrate itself more properly to the needs of body and mind in the environment provides an absolutely massive leg-up on the competition. The mirror neuron system would be a logical system to derive primary benefit from an increase in plasticity under the conditions proposed. If this adaptation were indeed a result of the mastery of fire and the additional nutrition and food security brought about by cooking, changes in communal relations would be a logical co-requisite development, as fire promised warmth and security, and the invention of cooking would have provided an easier way of feeding larger groups.\n\n"}

{"id": "21566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21566", "title": "Noam Chomsky", "text": "Noam Chomsky\n\nAvram Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, political activist, and social critic. Sometimes described as \"the father of modern linguistics\", Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and laureate professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of over 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.\nBorn to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He began studying at the University of Pennsylvania at age 16, taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. From 1951 to 1955, he was appointed to Harvard University's Society of Fellows. While at Harvard, he developed the theory of transformational grammar; for this, he was awarded his doctorate in 1955. Chomsky began teaching at MIT in 1957 and emerged as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work \"Syntactic Structures\", which remodelled the scientific study of language. From 1958 to 1959, he was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. Chomsky is credited as the creator or co-creator of the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of behaviorism, being particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.\nChomsky vocally opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, believing the war to be an act of American imperialism. In 1967, Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for his anti-war essay entitled \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\". Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and was placed on Nixon's \"Enemies List\". While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the Linguistics Wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later co-wrote , which articulated the propaganda model of media criticism, and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. Additionally, his defense of freedom of speech—including free speech for Holocaust deniers—generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the early 1980s. Following his retirement from active teaching, Chomsky has continued his vocal political activism by opposing the War on Terror and supporting the Occupy Movement.\nOne of the most cited scholars in history, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as a paradigm shifter who helped spark a major revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarly research, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proved highly significant within the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements. Some of his critics have accused him of anti-Americanism.\n\nAvram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the East Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father was William \"Zev\" Chomsky, an Ashkenazi Jew originally from Ukraine who had fled to the United States in 1913. Having studied at Johns Hopkins University, William went on to become school principal of the Congregation Mikveh Israel religious school, and in 1924 was appointed to the faculty at Gratz College in Philadelphia. Chomsky's mother was the Belarusian-born Elsie Simonofsky (1904–1972), a teacher and activist whom William had met while working at Mikveh Israel.\n\nNoam was the Chomsky family's first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later. The brothers were close, although David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive. Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of Zionism; the family was particularly influenced by the Left Zionist writings of Ahad Ha'am. As a Jew, Chomsky faced anti-semitism as a child, particularly from the Irish and German communities living in Philadelphia.\n\nChomsky described his parents as \"normal Roosevelt Democrats\" who had a center-left position on the political spectrum; however, he was exposed to far-left politics through other members of the family, a number of whom were socialists involved in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. He was substantially influenced by his uncle who owned a newspaper stand in New York City, where Jewish leftists came to debate the issues of the day. Whenever visiting his uncle, Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores in the city, voraciously reading political literature. He later described his discovery of anarchism as \"a lucky accident\", because it allowed him to become critical of other far-left ideologies, namely Stalinism and other forms of Marxism–Leninism.\n\nChomsky's primary education was at Oak Lane Country Day School, an independent Deweyite institution that focused on allowing its pupils to pursue their own interests in a non-competitive atmosphere. It was here, at the age of 10, that he wrote his first article, on the spread of fascism, following the fall of Barcelona to Francisco Franco's fascist army in the Spanish Civil War. At the age of 12, Chomsky moved on to secondary education at Central High School, where he joined various clubs and societies and excelled academically, but was troubled by the hierarchical and regimented method of teaching used there. During the same time period, Chomsky attended the Hebrew High School at Gratz College. From the age of 12 or 13, he identified more fully with anarchist politics.\n\nIn 1945, Chomsky, aged 16, embarked on a general program of study at the University of Pennsylvania, where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning Arabic. Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew. However, he was frustrated with his experiences at the university, and considered dropping out and moving to a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine. His intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist Zellig Harris, whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject. Chomsky's B.A. honors thesis was titled \"Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew\", and involved his applying Harris's methods to the language. Chomsky revised this thesis for his M.A., which he received at Penn in 1951; it would subsequently be published as a book. He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of his teacher Nelson Goodman.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1955, Chomsky was named to the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, where he undertook research on what would become his doctoral dissertation. Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply, a significant factor in his decision to move to Harvard was that the philosopher W. V. Quine was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, J. L. Austin of the University of Oxford, would strongly influence Chomsky. In 1952, Chomsky published his first academic article, \"Systems of Syntactic Analysis\", which appeared not in a journal of linguistics, but in \"The Journal of Symbolic Logic\". Being highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures given at the University of Chicago and Yale University. Although he had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, in 1955 he submitted a thesis to them setting out his ideas on transformational grammar; he was awarded his Ph.D. on the basis of it, and it would be privately distributed among specialists on microfilm before being published in 1975 as part of \"The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory\". Possession of this Ph.D. nullified his requirement to enter national service in the armed forces, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955. George Armitage Miller, a Professor at Harvard, read the Ph.D. and was impressed; together he and Chomsky published a number of technical papers in mathematical linguistics.\n\nIn 1947, Chomsky entered into a romantic relationship with Carol Doris Schatz, whom he had known since they were toddlers, and they married in 1949. After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to an apartment in the Allston area of Boston, remaining there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of Lexington. In 1953 the couple took up a Harvard travel grant in order to visit Europe, traveling from the United Kingdom through France and Switzerland and into Italy. On that same trip they also spent six weeks in Israel at Hashomer Hatzair's HaZore'a Kibbutz. Although enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the Jewish nationalism and anti-Arab racism that he encountered in the country, as well as the pro-Stalinist trend that he thought pervaded the kibbutz's leftist community.\n\nOn visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of Yiddish anarchist journal \"Freie Arbeiter Stimme\", becoming enamored with the ideas of contributor Rudolf Rocker, whose work introduced him to the link between anarchism and classical liberalism. Other political thinkers whose work Chomsky read included the anarchist Diego Abad de Santillán, democratic socialists George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, and Dwight Macdonald, and works by Marxists Karl Liebknecht, Karl Korsch, and Rosa Luxemburg. His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the Spanish Civil War, which were documented in Orwell's \"Homage to Catalonia\" (1938). He avidly read leftist journal \"politics\", remarking that it \"answered to and developed\" his interest in anarchism, as well as the periodical \"Living Marxism\", published by council communist Paul Mattick. Although rejecting its Marxist basis, Chomsky was heavily influenced by council communism, voraciously reading articles in \"Living Marxism\" written by Antonie Pannekoek. He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the Leninist League, an anti-Stalinist Marxist–Leninist group, sharing their views that the Second World War was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union's \"state capitalists\" to crush Europe's proletariat.\n\nChomsky had befriended two linguists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Morris Halle and Roman Jakobson, the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position at MIT in 1955. There Chomsky spent half his time on a mechanical translation project, and the other half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy. Chomsky had been recruited to MIT by Jerome Wiesner, an influential scientist who, at this time, was also involved in getting the US's nuclear missile program established Having brought such missile research to MIT, Wiesner then became a nuclear strategy adviser to both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, before returning to MIT to oversee research programmes at the Institute. However, despite its military involvement, Chomsky has described MIT as \"a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work.\" In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by Columbia University as a visiting professor. That same year, Chomsky's first child, a daughter named Aviva, was born, and he published his first book on linguistics, \"Syntactic Structures\", a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris–Bloomfield trend in the field. The response to Chomsky's ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused \"significant upheaval\" in the discipline. Linguist John Lyons later asserted that it \"revolutionized the scientific study of language\". From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1959 he published a review of B. F. Skinner's 1957 book \"Verbal Behavior\" in the journal \"Language\", in which he argued against Skinner's view of language as learned behavior. Opining that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics, his review helped him to become an \"established intellectual\", and he proceeded to found MIT's Graduate Program in linguistics with Halle. In 1961 he was awarded academic tenure, being made a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics. He went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth International Congress of Linguists, held in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which established him as the \"de facto\" spokesperson of American linguistics. He continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in \"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax\" (1966), \"Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar\" (1966), and \"Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought\" (1966). Along with Halle, he also edited the \"Studies in Language\" series of books for Harper and Row, and extended the theory of generative grammar to phonology in \"The Sound Pattern of English\" (1968).\n\nHe continued to receive academic recognition and honors for his work, in 1966 visiting a variety of Californian institutions, first as the Linguistics Society of America Professor at the University of California, and then as the Beckman Professor at the University of California, Berkeley. His Beckman lectures would be assembled and published as \"Language and Mind\" in 1968. In this period, military scientists were also interested in Chomsky's linguistics. As former Air Force Colonel, Anthony Debons, said: \"much of the research conducted at MIT by Chomsky and his colleagues [has] direct application to the efforts undertaken by military scientists to develop … languages for computer operations in military command and control systems.\" Indeed, between 1963 and 1965, Chomsky was a consultant for a military sponsored project \"to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control.\" One of Chomsky's students who also worked on this project, Barbara Partee, says that this research was justified to the military on the basis that \"in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program.\"\n\nHowever, these scientists eventually found Chomsky's theories unworkable for their computer systems. Other subsequent difficulties with the theories led to various debates between Chomsky and his critics that came to be known as the \"Linguistics Wars\", although they revolved largely around debating philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.\n\nChomsky first involved himself in active political protest against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes. However, it was not until 1967 that he publicly entered the debate on United States foreign policy. In February he published a widely read essay in \"The New York Review of Books\" entitled \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\", in which he criticized the country's involvement in the conflict; the essay was based on an earlier talk that he had given to Harvard's Foundation for Jewish Campus Life. He expanded on his argument to produce his first political book, \"American Power and the New Mandarins,\" which was published in 1969 and soon established him at the forefront of American dissent. His other political books of the time included \"At War with Asia\" (1971), \"The Backroom Boys\" (1973), \"For Reasons of State\" (1973), and \"Peace in the Middle East?\" (1975), published by Pantheon Books. Coming to be associated with the American New Left movement, he nevertheless thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm, and preferred the company of activists to intellectuals. Although \"The New York Review of Books\" did publish contributions from Chomsky and other leftists from 1967 to 1973, when an editorial change put a stop to it, he was virtually ignored by the rest of the mainstream press throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nAlong with his writings, Chomsky also became actively involved in left-wing activism. Refusing to pay half his taxes, he publicly supported students who refused the draft, and was arrested for being part of an anti-war teach-in outside the Pentagon. During this time, Chomsky, along with Mitchell Goodman, Denise Levertov, William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight Macdonald, also founded the anti-war collective RESIST. Although he questioned the objectives of the 1968 student protests, Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups; furthermore, he and his colleague Louis Kampf began running undergraduate courses on politics at MIT, independently of the conservative-dominated political science department.\n\nDuring this period, MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam and, as Chomsky says, \"a good deal of [nuclear] missile guidance technology was developed right on the MIT campus\". As Chomsky elaborates, \"[MIT was] about 90% Pentagon funded at that time. And I personally was right in the middle of it. I was in a military lab ... the Research Laboratory for Electronics.\" By 1969, student activists were actively campaigning \"to stop the war research\" at MIT. Chomsky was sympathetic to the students but he also thought it best to keep such research on campus and he proposed that it should be restricted to what he called \"systems of a purely defensive and deterrent character\". MIT had six of its anti-war student activists sentenced to prison terms. Chomsky says MIT's students suffered things that \"should not have happened.\" However, Chomsky has also claimed that MIT has \"quite a good record on civil liberties\". In 1970 Chomsky visited the Vietnamese city of Hanoi to give a lecture at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology; on this trip he also toured Laos to visit the refugee camps created by the war, and in 1973 he was among those leading a committee to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the War Resisters League.\n\nAs a result of his anti-war activism, Chomsky was ultimately arrested on multiple occasions, and U.S. President Richard Nixon included him on the master version of his \"Enemies List\". He was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience, and his wife began studying for her own Ph.D. in linguistics in order to support the family in the event of Chomsky's imprisonment or loss of employment. However, MIT – despite being under some pressure to do so – refused to fire him due to his influential standing in the field of linguistics. His work in this area continued to gain international recognition; in 1967 he received honorary doctorates from both the University of London and the University of Chicago. In 1970, Loyola University and Swarthmore College also awarded him honorary D.H.L.'s, as did Bard College in 1971, Delhi University in 1972, and the University of Massachusetts in 1973.\n\nIn 1971 Chomsky gave the Bertrand Russell Memorial Lectures at the University of Cambridge, which were published as \"Problems of Knowledge and Freedom\" later that year. He also delivered the Whidden Lectures at McMaster University, the Huizinga Lecture at Leiden University in the Netherlands, the Woodbridge Lectures at Columbia University, and the Kant Lectures at Stanford University. In 1971 he partook in a televised debate with French philosopher Michel Foucault on Dutch television, entitled \"Human Nature: Justice versus Power\". Although largely agreeing with Foucault's ideas, he was critical of post-modernism and French philosophy generally, believing that post-modern leftist philosophers used obfuscating language which did little to aid the cause of the working-classes and lambasting France as having \"a highly parochial and remarkably illiterate culture\". Chomsky also continued to publish prolifically in linguistics, publishing \"Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar\" (1972), an enlarged edition of \"Language and Mind\" (1972), and \"Reflections on Language\" (1975). In 1974 he became a corresponding fellow of the British Academy.\n\nThroughout the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomsky's publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory. His public talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized actions of the Israeli government and military, and his political views came under attack from right-wing and centrist figures, the most prominent of whom was Alan Dershowitz. Chomsky considered Dershowitz \"a complete liar\" and accused him of actively misrepresenting his position on issues. During the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with Edward S. Herman, who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam. Together they authored \"\", a book which criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and highlighted how mainstream media neglected to cover stories about these activities; the publisher Warner Modular initially accepted it, and it was published in 1973. However, Warner Modular's parent company, Warner Communications, disapproved of the book's contents and ordered all copies to be destroyed.\n\nWhile mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from Michael Albert's South End Press, an activist-oriented publishing company.\nIn 1979, Chomsky and Herman revised \"Counter-Revolutionary Violence\" and published it with South End Press as the two-volume \"The Political Economy of Human Rights\". In this they compared U.S. media reactions to the Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. They argued that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on that in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy. Taking a particular interest in the situation in East Timor, Chomsky testified on the subject in front of the United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization in both 1978 and 1979, and attended a conference on the occupation held in Lisbon in 1979. The following year, the Marxist academic, Steven Lukes authored an article for the \"Times Higher Education Supplement\" accusing Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader Pol Pot. Laura J. Summers and Robin Woodsworth Carlsen replied to the article, arguing that Lukes completely misunderstood Chomsky and Herman's work. The controversy damaged his reputation, and Chomsky maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies about him in order to defame him.\n\nAlthough Chomsky had long publicly criticized Nazism and totalitarianism more generally, his commitment to freedom of speech led him to defend the right of French historian Robert Faurisson to advocate a position widely characterized as Holocaust denial. Without Chomsky's knowledge, his plea for the historian's freedom of speech was published as the preface to Faurisson's 1980 book \"Mémoire en défense contre ceux qui m'accusent de falsifier l'histoire\". Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson, and France's mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations. Critiquing Chomsky's position, sociologist Werner Cohn later published an analysis of the affair titled \"Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers\". The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomsky's career, and Chomsky did not visit France, where the translation of his political writings was delayed until the 2000s, for almost thirty years following the debacle.\n\nThe election of Republican Party candidate Ronald Reagan to the U.S. Presidency in 1980 marked a period of increased military intervention in Central America. In 1985, during Nicaragua's Contra War – in which the U.S. supported the Contra militia against the Sandinista government – Chomsky travelled to Managua to meet with workers' organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics. Many of these lectures would be published in 1987 as \"On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures\". In 1983 he published \"The Fateful Triangle\", an examination of the Israel-Palestine conflict and the place of the U.S. within it, arguing that the U.S. had continually used the conflict for its own ends. In 1988, Chomsky then visited the Palestinian territories to witness the impact of Israeli military occupation.\n\nIn 1988, Chomsky and Herman published \"Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media\", in which they outlined their propaganda model for understanding the mainstream media; there they argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news provided was censored through four filters which had a great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented. The book was adapted into a 1992 film, \"\", which was directed by Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick. In 1989, Chomsky published \"Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies,\" in which he critiqued what he sees as the pseudo-democratic nature of Western capitalist states.\n\nBy the 1980s, a number of Chomsky's students had become leading linguistic specialists in their own right, expanding, revising, and expanding on Chomsky's ideas of generative grammar. By the end of the 1980s, Chomsky had established himself as a globally recognized figure.\n\nIn the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before. Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance. The lectures that he gave on the subject would be published as \"Powers and Prospects\" in 1996. As a result of the international publicity generated by Chomsky, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist John Pilger. After East Timor's independence from Indonesia was achieved in 1999, the Australian-led International Force for East Timor arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing that it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the Timor Gap Treaty. Chomsky's book \"Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order\" was a Boston Globe and Voice Literary Supplement bestseller in 1999.\n\nChomsky retired from full-time teaching, although as an Emeritus he nevertheless continued to conduct research and seminars at MIT.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed, with these interviews being collated and published by Seven Stories Press in October.\nChomsky argued that the ensuing War on Terror was not a new development, but rather a continuation of the same U.S. foreign policy and its concomitant rhetoric that had been pursued since at least the Reagan era of the 1980s. In 2003 he published \"Hegemony or Survival\", in which he articulated what he called the United States' \"imperial grand strategy\" and critiqued the Iraq War and other aspects of the 'War on Terror.'\n\nChomsky toured the world with increasing regularity during this period, giving talks on various subjects. In 2001 he gave the D.T. Lakdawala Memorial Lecture in New Delhi, India, and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the Latin American Association of Social Scientists. In 2002 Chomsky visited Turkey in order to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky's books; Chomsky insisted on being a co-defendant and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the prosecution on the first day. During that trip, Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favour of the Kurds' human rights. A supporter of the World Social Forum, he attended their conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.\n\nHis wife, Carol, died in December 2008.\n\nChomsky was drawn to the energy and activism of the Occupy movement, delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence, first \"Occupy\" a pamphlet, in 2012, then, in 2013, \"Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity\". Both were published by Zuccotti Park Press. His analysis included a critique that attributed Occupy's growth as a response to a perceived abandonment of the interests of the white working class by the Democratic Party.\n\nIn March 2014, Chomsky joined the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation advisory council and is a senior fellow there.\n\nIn late 2015, Chomsky announced his support for Vermont U.S. senator Bernie Sanders in the upcoming 2016 United States presidential election.\n\nIn early 2016, Chomsky was publicly rebuked by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey after he signed an open letter condemning the Turkish leader for his anti-Kurdish repression and for holding double standards on terrorism. Chomsky accused Erdoğan of hypocrisy and added that the Turkish president supports al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, the al-Nusra Front. Chomsky also criticized the U.S.'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and U.S. involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, highlighting that Saudi has \"one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world\".\n\nIn 2016, the documentary \"Requiem for the American Dream\" was released, summarizing his views on capitalism and economic inequality through a \"75-minute teach-in\". \"Requiem for the American Dream\" was published as a book in 2017, and is a furthering of the ideas put forward in the 2016 documentary (Seven Stories Press).\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Chomsky called Donald Trump an \"ignorant, thin-skinned megalomaniac\" and a \"greater evil\" than Hillary Clinton. Asked about claims that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election through hacking, Chomsky said: \"It's possible, but it's a kind of strange complaint in the United States. The U.S. has been interfering with, and undermining, elections all over the world for decades and is proud of it.\"\n\nIn August 2017, at age 88 and retired since 2002, Chomsky left MIT to join the linguistics department of University of Arizona in Tucson as part-time faculty, officially starting a few weeks later, and teaching in spring 2018. His salary is covered by philanthropy funds. Chomsky will maintain an office in Cambridge.\n\nIn July 2018, Chomsky said in an interview with \"Democracy Now!\" that \"it's hard to think of a more brutal and sadistic policy\" about the Trump administration family separation policy. In the same interview Chomsky also said that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's victory of the 2018 New York primary election \"was a quite spectacular and significant event\".\n\nWithin the field of linguistics, McGilvray credits Chomsky with inaugurating the \"cognitive revolution\". McGilvray also credits him with establishing the field as a formal, natural science, moving it away from the procedural form of structural linguistics that was dominant during the mid-20th century. As such, some have called him \"the father of modern linguistics\".\n\nThe basis to Chomsky's linguistic theory is rooted in biolinguistics, holding that the principles underlying the structure of language are biologically determined in the human mind and hence genetically transmitted. He therefore argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences. In adopting this position, Chomsky rejects the radical behaviorist psychology of B. F. Skinner which views the mind as a \"tabula rasa\" (\"blank slate\") and thus treats language as learned behavior. Accordingly, he argues that language is a unique evolutionary development of the human species and is unlike modes of communication used by any other animal species. Chomsky's nativist, internalist view of language is consistent with the philosophical school of \"rationalism\", and is contrasted with the anti-nativist, externalist view of language, which is consistent with the philosophical school of \"empiricism\".\n\nSince the 1960s, Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain parochial features of their native languages. Chomsky based his argument on observations about human language acquisition, noting that there is an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic knowledge they attain (see: \"poverty of the stimulus\" argument). For example, although children are exposed to only a finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones which have never before been uttered. To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data (PLD) must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks as the language acquisition device (LAD), and he suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to determine what the LAD is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints constitute \"universal grammar\".\n\nBeginning with his \"Syntactic Structures\" (1957), a distillation of his \"Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory\" (1955), Chomsky challenges structural linguistics and introduces transformational grammar.\n\nChomsky's theory posits that language consists of both deep structures and surface structures. Surface structure 'faces out' and is represented by spoken utterances, while deep structure 'faces inward' and expresses the underlying relations between words and conceptual meaning. Transformational grammar is a generative grammar (which dictates that the syntax, or word order, of surface structures adheres to certain principles and parameters) that consists of a limited series of rules, expressed in mathematical notation, which transform deep structures into well-formed surface structures. The transformational grammar thus relates meaning and sound.\n\nThe Chomsky hierarchy, sometimes referred to as the Chomsky-Schützenberger hierarchy, is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars. The hierarchy imposes a logical structure across different language classes and provides a basis for understanding the relationship between grammars (devices that enumerate the valid sentences within languages). In order of increasing expressive power it includes regular (or Type-3) grammars, context-free (or Type-2) grammars, context-sensitive (or Type-1) grammars, and recursively enumerable (or Type-0) grammars. Each class is a strict subset of the class above it, i.e., each successive class can generate a broader set of formal languages (infinite sets of strings composed from finite sets of symbols, or alphabets) than the one below. In addition to being important in linguistics, the Chomsky hierarchy is also relevant in theoretical computer science, especially in programming language theory, compiler construction, and automata theory.\n\nSince the 1990s, much of Chomsky's research has focused on what he calls the Minimalist Program (MP), in which he departs from much of his past research and instead attempts to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties that could be expected, given certain external conditions that are imposed on us independently. Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as 'deep structure' and 'surface structure' and instead places emphasis on the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, along with which comes an infinite number of concepts, or 'logical forms'. When exposed to linguistic data, the brain of a hearer-speaker then proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar that we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way that language works. Thus, while much of Chomsky's prior research has focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms that the brain uses to \"create\" these rules.\n\nChomsky has built a \"reputation as a political dissident\". Chomsky's political views have changed little since his childhood, when he was influenced by the emphasis on political activism that was ingrained in Jewish working-class tradition. He usually identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist or a libertarian socialist. He views these positions not as precise political theories but as ideals that he thinks best meet the needs of humans: liberty, community, and freedom of association. Unlike some other socialists, such as those who accept Marxism, Chomsky believes that politics lies outside the remit of science; however, he still roots his ideas about an ideal society in empirical data and empirically justified theories.\n\nIn Chomsky's view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed through elite corporate interests, who use corporate media, advertising, and think tanks to promote their own propaganda. His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth that they obscure. He believes that \"common sense\" is all that is required to break through the web of falsehood and see the truth, if it (common sense) is employed using both critical thinking skills and an awareness of the role that self-interest and self-deception plays both on oneself and on others. He believes that it is the moral responsibility of intellectuals to tell the truth about the world, but claims that few do so because they fear losing prestige and funding. He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his privilege, resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles.\n\nAlthough he had joined protest marches and organized activist groups, he identifies his primarily political outlet as being that of education, offering free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness. His political writings have covered a wide range of topics, although there are a number of core themes throughout much of his work. He is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World international union, and sits on the interim consultative committee of the International Organization for a Participatory Society.\n\nChomsky has been a prominent critic of U.S. imperialism. His published work has focused heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States, such as the U.S.-backed state terror campaign against left-wing dissidents across Latin America known as Operation Condor. Chomsky believes that the basic principle of the foreign policy of the United States is the establishment of \"open societies\" that are economically and politically controlled by the U.S. and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper. He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power. When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective.\nHe believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British imperialism have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading Christianity; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them. Prominent examples that he regularly cites are the actions of the British Empire in India and Africa, and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n\nChomsky explains his decision to focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy. His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway the population of the U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature. He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; to accept responsibility for one's own thoughts and actions; and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.\n\nHe has been critical of U.S. involvement in the Israel–Palestine conflict, arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement. Chomsky has long endorsed the left binationalist program, seeking to create a democratic state in the Levant that is home to both Jews and Arabs. However, acknowledging the realpolitik of the situation, Chomsky has also considered a two-state solution on the condition that both nation-states exist on equal terms. As a result of his criticisms of Israel, Chomsky was barred from entering Israel in 2010.\n\nIn his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of capitalism and the selfish pursuit of material advancement. At the same time, he developed a disdain for the authoritarian attempts to establish a socialist society, as represented by the Marxist–Leninist policies of the Soviet Union. Rather than accepting the common view among American economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy on the one hand and total private ownership on the other, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy on the one hand and total autocratic control (whether state or private) on the other. He argues that Western capitalist nations are not really democratic, because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy. He has stated his opposition to ruling elites, among them institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and GATT.\n\nChomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the Bretton Woods financial control agreements. He characterizes the U.S. as a \"de facto\" one-party state, viewing both the Republican Party and Democratic Party as manifestations of a single \"Business Party\" controlled by corporate and financial interests. Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.\n\nNoting that this economic system is firmly entrenched and difficult to overthrow, he believes that change is possible through the organized co-operation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to re-organize the economy in a more equitable way. Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible. He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of the upheaval.\n\nChomsky deems libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas to be the inheritors of the classical liberal ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, arguing that his ideological position revolves around \"nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being\".\nHe envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future in which there is direct worker control of the means of production, with society governed by workers' councils, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies. In this, he believes that there will be no need for political parties. By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction, a sense of fulfillment, and purpose to their work. He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.\n\nChomsky's political writings have largely been focused on the two concepts of ideology and power, or the media and state policy. One of Chomsky's best-known works, \"Manufacturing Consent\", dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, from government-guided \"free market\" forces, is more subtle and difficult to undermine than the equivalent propaganda system that was present in the Soviet Union. As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests. Although acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the choice of topics and issues featured in the mass media, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions that are expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology. He states that, although the mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part. As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators. He also points to examples of important news stories that have been ignored by U.S. mainstream media because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the U.S. state: For instance, it ignored the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton with possible FBI involvement, the massacres perpetrated in Nicaragua by the U.S.-funded Contras, and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths while ignoring the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in the conflict between those two nations.\nTo remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.\n\nChomsky considers most conspiracy theories to be fruitless, distracting substitutes to thinking about policy formation in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives. He does not dismiss conspiracy theories outright, but he does consider them unproductive to challenging power in a substantial way.\nIn response to the labeling of his own thoughts as \"conspiracy theory\", Chomsky has replied that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether General Motors would be accused of conspiracy if they deliberately selected what they would use or discard to sell their product.\n\nChomsky has also been active in a number of philosophical fields, including the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of science. In these fields he has been highly critical of many other philosophers, in particular those operating within the field of cognitive science.\n\nChomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another, calling himself \"scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom\". An intensely private person, he is uninterested in appearances and the fame that his work has brought him. McGilvray suggested that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but that he was impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so. He also has little interest in modern art and music. He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the U.S., he subscribes to \"The Boston Globe\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Financial Times\", and \"The Christian Science Monitor\". He acknowledges that his income and the financial security that it accords him means that he lives a privileged life compared to the majority of the world's population. He characterizes himself as a \"worker\", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill.\n\nDespite having been raised Jewish, Chomsky is currently non-religious, although he has expressed approval of forms of religion such as liberation theology. He is known for his \"dry, laconic wit\", and for the use of irony in his writings, and has attracted controversy for labeling established political and academic figures with terms such as \"corrupt\", \"fascist\", and \"fraudulent\". Chomsky's colleague Steven Pinker has said that he \"portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric\", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions that he generates from his critics. Chomsky avoids attending academic conferences, including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.\n\nChomsky was married to Carol Doris Schatz (Chomsky) from 1949 until her death in 2008. They had three children together: Aviva (b. 1957), Diane (b. 1960), and Harry (b. 1967). In 2014, Chomsky married Valeria Wasserman.\n\nChomsky's legacy is as both a \"leader in the field\" of linguistics and \"a figure of enlightenment and inspiration\" for political dissenters. Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in him being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being \"on the outer margin of acceptability.\"\n\nLinguist John Lyons remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become \"the most dynamic and influential\" school of thought in the field. By the 1970s, his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy, while a poll conducted by Minnesota State University found \"Syntactic Structures\" to be the single most important work in the field of cognitive science. In addition, his work in automata theory and the Chomsky hierarchy has become well known in computer science, and he is much cited within the field of computational linguistics.\n\nChomsky's work contributed substantially to the decline of behaviorist psychology; in addition, some arguments in evolutionary psychology are derived from his research results. Nim Chimpsky, a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in animal language acquisition at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.\n\nThe 1984 Nobel Prize laureate in Medicine and Physiology, Niels Kaj Jerne, used Chomsky's generative model to explain the human immune system, equating \"components of a generative grammar ... with various features of protein structures\". The title of Jerne's Stockholm Nobel Lecture was \"The Generative Grammar of the Immune System\". His theory of generative grammar has also carried over into music theory and analysis.\nAn MIT press release found that Chomsky was cited within the Arts and Humanities Citation Index more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992.\n\nDespite their respect for his intellectual contribution, a number of linguists and philosophers have been very critical of Chomsky's approach to language. These critics include Christina Behme, Cedric Boeckx, Margaret Boden, Rudolph Botha, Vyvyan Evans, Nicholas Evans, Daniel Everett, Adele Goldberg, Anna Kinsella, Chris Knight, Stephen Levinson, Bruce Nevin, Geoffrey K. Pullum, Barbara Scholtz, Pieter Seuren and Michael Tomasello.\n\nChomsky's approach to academic freedom has led him to give support to MIT academics whose actions he deplores. In 1969, when Chomsky heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened \"to protest publicly\" if Rostow was \"denied a position at MIT\". Then, in 1989, when Pentagon adviser John Deutch wanted to be the President of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, \"The New York Times\" quoted Chomsky as saying, \"He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met... If somebody's got to be running the C.I.A., I'm glad it's him.\"\n\nChomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes the linguist and activist as \"one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people\", while journalist John Pilger described him as a \"genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins – activists and movements – he's unfailingly supportive.\" Arundhati Roy called him \"one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time\", and Edward Said thought him to be \"one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions\". Fred Halliday stated that by the start of the 21st century, Chomsky had become a \"guru\" for the world's anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements. The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media, also exerting a significant influence on the growth of alternative media, including radio, publishers, and the Internet, which in turn have helped to disseminate his work.\n\nHowever, Sperlich notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press. University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their syllabuses for undergraduate reading. Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no expertise in these areas; to this he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many social scientists claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them, regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so or not.\n\nHis far-reaching criticisms of U.S. foreign policy and the legitimacy of U.S. power have raised controversy. A document obtained pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from the U.S. government revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored Chomsky's activities and for years denied doing so. The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky at some point in time, possibly in violation of federal law. He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East, although he has refused uniformed police protection. German newspaper \"Der Spiegel\" described him as \"the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred\", while conservative commentator David Horowitz termed him \"the most devious, the most dishonest and ... the most treacherous intellect in America\", one whose work was infused with an \"anti-American dementia\" and which evidences Chomsky's \"pathological hatred of his own country\". Writing in \"Commentary\" magazine, the journalist Jonathan Kay described Chomsky as \"a hard-boiled anti-American monomaniac who simply refuses to believe anything that any American leader says\".\n\nHis criticism of Israel has led to him being accused of being a traitor to the Jewish people and an anti-Semite. Criticizing Chomsky's defense of the right of individuals to engage in Holocaust denial on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints, Werner Cohn accused Chomsky of being \"the most important patron\" of the Neo-Nazi movement, while the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) accused him of being a Holocaust denier himself. The ADL have been accused of monitoring Chomsky's activities, and have characterized him as a \"dupe of intellectual pride so overweening that he is incapable of making distinctions between totalitarian and democratic societies, between oppressors and victims\". In turn, Chomsky has claimed that the ADL is dominated by \"Stalinist types\" who oppose democracy in Israel. Alan Dershowitz considered Chomsky to be a \"false prophet of the left\", while Chomsky has accused Dershowitz of being on \"a crazed jihad, dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation\".\n\nAccording to McGilvray, many of Chomsky's critics \"do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky's text\".\n\nIn Spring 2017, Chomsky taught a short-term politics course at the University of Arizona.\n\nIn 1970, Chomsky was named one of the \"makers of the twentieth century\" by the London \"Times\". In early 1969, he delivered the John Locke Lectures at Oxford University; in January 1971, the Bertrand Russell Memorial Lecture at the University of Cambridge; in 1972, the Nehru Memorial Lecture in New Delhi; in 1975, the Whidden Lectures at McMaster University; in 1977, the Huizinga Lecture in Leiden; in 1978, the Woodbridge Lectures at Columbia University; in 1979, the Kant Lectures at Stanford University; in 1988, the Massey Lectures at the University of Toronto; in 1997, The Davie Memorial Lecture on Academic Freedom in Cape Town; in 2011, the Rickman Godlee Lecture at University College, London; and many others.\n\nChomsky has received honorary degrees from many colleges and universities around the world, including from the following:\n\nIn the United States, he is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, the Linguistic Society of America, the American Philosophical Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Abroad, he is a member of the Utrecht Society of Arts and Sciences, the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, a corresponding fellow of the British Academy, an honorary member of the British Psychological Society, and a foreign member of the Department of Social Sciences of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In addition, he is a recipient of a 1971 Guggenheim Fellowship, the 1984 American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology, 1988 the Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences, the 1996 Helmholtz Medal, the 1999 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science, and the Dorothy Eldridge Peacemaker Award. He is also a two-time winner of the Gustavus Myers Center Award, receiving the honor in both 1986 and 1988, and the NCTE George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language, receiving the honor in both 1987 and 1989. He has also received the Rabindranath Tagore Centenary Award from The Asiatic Society.\n\nIn 2004 Chomsky received the Carl-von-Ossietzky Prize from the city of Oldenburg, Germany, to acknowledge his body of work as a political analyst and media critic. In 2005, Chomsky received an honorary fellowship from the Literary and Historical Society. In February 2008, he received the President's Medal from the Literary and Debating Society of the National University of Ireland, Galway. Since 2009, he has been an honorary member of International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters (IAPTI).\n\nIn 2010, Chomsky received the Erich Fromm Prize in Stuttgart, Germany. In April 2010, Chomsky became the third scholar to receive the University of Wisconsin's A.E. Havens Center's Award for Lifetime Contribution to Critical Scholarship.\nChomsky has an Erdős number of four.\n\nChomsky was voted the world's leading public intellectual in The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll jointly conducted by American magazine \"Foreign Policy\" and British magazine \"Prospect\". In a list compiled by the magazine \"New Statesman\" in 2006, he was voted seventh in the list of \"Heroes of our time.\"\n\nActor Viggo Mortensen and avant-garde guitarist Buckethead dedicated their 2003 album \"Pandemoniumfromamerica\" to Chomsky. On January 22, 2010, a special honorary concert for Chomsky was given at Kresge Auditorium at MIT.

These oral traditions included different types of stories about Jesus. For example, people told anecdotes about Jesus healing the sick and debating with his opponents. The traditions also included sayings attributed to Jesus, such as parables and teachings on various subjects which, along with other sayings, formed the oral gospel tradition.\n\nBiblical scholars use a variety of critical methodologies known as biblical criticism. They apply source criticism to identify the written sources beneath the canonical gospels. Scholars generally understood that these written sources must have had a prehistory as oral tellings, but the very nature of oral transmission seemed to rule out the possibility of recovering them. However, in the early 20th century the German scholar Hermann Gunkel demonstrated a new critical method, form criticism, which he believed could discover traces of oral tradition in written texts. Gunkel specialized in Old Testament studies, but other scholars soon adopted and adapted his methods to the study of the New Testament.\n\nThe essence of form criticism is the identification of the \"Sitz im Leben\", \"situation in life\", which gave rise to a particular written passage. When form critics discuss oral traditions about Jesus, they theorize about the particular social situation in which different accounts of Jesus were told. For New Testament scholars, this focus remains the Second Temple period. It needs be remembered that the first century Palestine of Jesus was predominantly an oral society.\n\nA modern consensus exists that Jesus must be understood as a Jew in a Jewish environment. According to scholar Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus was so very firmly rooted in his own time and place as a first-century Palestinian Jew – with his ancient Jewish comprehension of the world, and God – that he does not translate easily into a modern idiom. Ehrman stresses that Jesus was raised in a Jewish household in the Jewish hamlet of Nazareth. He was brought up in a Jewish culture, accepted Jewish ways and eventually became a Jewish teacher, who, like other Jewish teachers of his time, debated the Law of Moses orally. Early Christians sustained these teachings of Jesus orally. Rabbis or teachers in every generation were raised and trained to deliver this oral tradition accurately. It consisted of two parts: the Jesus tradition (i.e., logia or sayings of Jesus) and inspired opinion. The distinction is one of authority: where the earthly Jesus has spoken on a subject, that word is to be regarded as an instruction or command.\n\nThe accuracy of the oral gospel tradition was insured by the community designating certain learned individuals to bear the main responsibility for retaining the gospel message of Jesus. The prominence of teachers in the earliest communities such as the Jerusalem Church is best explained by the communities' reliance on them as repositories of oral tradition. One of the most striking features to emerge from recent study is the \"amazing consistency\" of the history of the tradition \"which gave birth to the NT\".\n\nA review of Richard Bauckham's book \"Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony\" states \"The common wisdom in the academy is that stories and sayings of Jesus circulated for decades, undergoing countless retellings and embellishments before being finally set down in writing.\"\n\nModern scholars have concluded that the Canonical Gospels went through four stages in their formation:\n\n\nMark, Matthew and Luke are known as the Synoptic Gospels because they have such a high degree of interdependence. Modern scholars generally agree that Mark was the first of the gospels to be written (see Markan priority). The author does not seem to have used extensive written sources, but rather to have woven together small collections and individual traditions into a coherent presentation. It is generally, though not universally, agreed that the authors of Matthew and Luke used as sources the gospel of Mark and a collection of sayings called the Q source. These two together account for the bulk of each of Matthew and Luke, with the remainder made up of smaller amounts of source material unique to each, called the M source for Matthew and the L source for Luke, which may have been a mix of written and oral material (see Two-source hypothesis). Most scholars believe that the author of John's gospel used oral and written sources different from those available to the Synoptic authors – a \"signs\" source, a \"revelatory discourse\" source, and others – although there are indications that a later editor of this gospel may have used Mark and Luke.\n\nOral transmission may also be seen as a different approach to understanding the Synoptic Gospels in New Testament scholarship. Current theories attempt to link the three synoptic gospels together through a common textual tradition. However, many problems arise when linking these three texts together (see the Synoptic problem). This has led many scholars to hypothesize the existence of a fourth document from which Matthew and Luke drew upon independently of each other (for example, the Q source). The Oral Transmission hypothesis based on the oral tradition steps away from this model, proposing instead that this common, shared tradition was transmitted orally rather than through a lost document.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31909887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31909887", "title": "Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)", "text": "Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)\n\nThe Proclamation of the Republic () was a military coup d'état that established the First Brazilian Republic on 15 November 1889. It overthrew the constitutional monarchy of the Empire of Brazil and ended the reign of Emperor Pedro II.\n\nThe proclamation of the Republic took place in Rio de Janeiro, then capital of the Empire of Brazil, when a group of military officers of the Brazilian Army, led by Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, staged a coup d'état without the use of violence, deposing Emperor Pedro II and the President of the Council of Ministers of the Empire, the Viscount of Ouro Preto.\n\nA provisional government was established that same day, 15 November, with Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca as President of the Republic and head of the interim Government.\n\nFrom the 1870s, as a consequence of the Paraguayan War (also called the War of the Triple Alliance, 1864-1870), the idea of some sectors of the elite was altered to change the current political regime. Factors that influenced this movement:\n\n\nThe Imperial Government, through the 37th and last ministerial cabinet, was inaugurated on 7 June 1889, under the command of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Empire, Afonso Celso de Assis Figueiredo, the Viscount of Ouro Preto of the Liberal Party, perceiving the difficult political situation in which he was present, presented in a last desperate attempt to save the Empire to the Chamber of Deputies, a program of political reforms which included, among others, the following measures: greater autonomy administrative freedom for the provinces (Federal system), universal suffrage, freedom of education, reduction of prerogatives of the Council of State and non-lifelong mandates for the Imperial Senate. The proposals of the Viscount de Ouro Preto aimed at preserving the monarchical regime in the country, but were vetoed by the majority of deputies of conservative tendency that controlled the General Chamber. On 15 November 1889, the republic was proclaimed by the positivist militaries supported by the agrarian elite resented for not being compensated for the abolition of slavery.\n\nThere were many factors that led the Empire to lose the support of its economic and military bases. On the part of the conservative groups, by the serious friction with the Catholic Church; by the loss of the political support of the great landowners for the abolition of slavery, which occurred in 1888 without the compensation of the slaveholders.\n\nOn the part of the progressive groups, there was the criticism that the monarchy had maintained until very late, the slavery in the country. Progressives also criticized the absence of initiatives aimed at the economic, political or social development of the country, the maintenance of a political regime of caste and census voting, that is, based on the annual income of the people, the absence of a system of universal education, high rates of illiteracy and misery, and the political withdrawal of Brazil from all other countries on the continent, which were republican.\n\nThus, at the same time that imperial legitimacy declined, the republican proposal - perceived as meaning social progress - gained space. However, it is important to note that the Emperor's legitimacy was distinct from that of the imperial regime: While, on the one hand, the population generally respected and loved Emperor Pedro II, on the other hand, had less and less the Empire. In this sense, it was a common voice at the time that there would be no third reign, that is, the monarchy would not continue to exist after the death of Pedro II, whether due to the lack of political support of the monarchical regime itself or due to public repudiation The prince consort, husband of Princess Isabel, the French Count d'Eu. The Count was known as arrogant, he did not listen well, he spoke with a French accent, and, moreover, he owned slums in Rio, for which he collected exorbitant rents from poor people. It was feared that, when Isabel ascended the throne, he would become the de facto ruler of Brazil.\n\nAlthough the phrase of Aristides Lobo (journalist and republican leader from São Paulo, later made provisional minister), \"The people witnessed bestialized\" to the proclamation of the republic, has entered into history, more recent historical research has given another version to the acceptance Of the republic among the Brazilian people. This is the case of the thesis defended by Maria Tereza Chaves de Mello (A República Consentida, FGV Publisher, EDUR, 2007), which indicates that the republic, before and after the proclamation, was popularly seen as a political regime that would bring about development, in a broad sense, to the country, Although the common people did not want to change the regime of government.\n\nThe abolitionist question had been imposed since the abolition of the slave trade in 1850, finding resistance among the country's traditional agrarian elites. In view of the measures adopted by the Empire for the gradual extinction of the slave regime, due to the repercussion of the unsuccessful experience in the United States of general liberation of the slaves having led that country to civil war, these elites demanded from the State reparations proportional to the total price they had paid by slaves to be liberated by law. These indemnities would be paid with an external loan.\n\nWith the enactment of the Golden Law (1888), and by failing to indemnify these large landowners, the Empire lost its last pillar of support. Called \"Republican last minute\" or Republican May 13, former slaveholders joined the Republican cause, not because of a sentiment, but as a \"revenge\" against the monarchy.\n\nIn the view of the progressives, the Empire of Brazil was very slow in the solution of the so-called \"Servant Question\", which undoubtedly undermined its legitimacy over the years. Even the adherence of the former slaveholders, who were not compensated, to the republican cause, shows how much the imperial regime was tied to slavery.\n\nThus, shortly after Princess Isabel signed the Golden Law, João Maurício Vanderlei, Baron of Cotejipe, the only senator of the empire who voted against the project of abolishing slavery, prophesied: \"His Highness redeemed a race but lost the throne\". Despite this, the republican and black journalist José do Patrocínio threw himself at the Princess's feet and named her \"redeemer\".\n\nFrom the colonial period, the Catholic Church, as institution, was submitted to the state. This was maintained after independence and meant, among other things, that no order of the Pope could be enforced in Brazil without having been previously approved by the Emperor (Regal Benefict). In 1872, Vital Maria Gonçalves de Oliveira and Antônio de Macedo Costa, bishops of Olinda and Belém respectively, decided to follow on their own the orders of Pope Pius IX, which excluded the Freemasons from the church. As members of high influence in monarchic Brazil were Freemasons (some books also mention Dom Pedro II himself as Mason), the bull was not ratified.\n\nThe bishops refused to obey the law and were arrested. In 1875, thanks to the intervention of the Duke of Caxias, the bishops received imperial pardon and were released. However, in the episode, the image of the Empire was worn next to the Catholic Church. And this was an aggravating factor in the crisis of the monarchy, since the support of the Catholic Church to the monarchy was always essential to its subsistence.\n\nThe military of the Brazilian Army was dissatisfied with the ban imposed by the monarchy, by which its officers could not express themselves in the press without the prior authorization of the Minister of War. The military did not have autonomy of decision-making on the defense of the territory, being subject to the orders of the Emperor and the Cabinet of Ministers, formed by civilians, that they surpassed to the orders of the generals. Thus, in the Empire, most war ministers were civilians.\n\nIn addition, often the Brazilian Army soldiers felt discredited and disrespected. On the one hand, the rulers of the empire were civilians, whose selection was extremely elitist and whose formation was bachelora, but that resulted in positions highly paid and valued; On the other hand, the military had a more democratic selection and a more technical formation, but did not result in professional valorization or political, social or economic recognition. Military career promotions were hard to come by and were based on personal criteria rather than on merit and seniority promotions.\n\nThe Paraguayan War, in addition to spreading republican ideals, showed the military this devaluation of the professional career, which continued and even intensified after the end of the war. The result was the perception, on the part of the military, that they sacrificed themselves for a regime that little considered them and that gave more attention to the Navy of Brazil. Simultaneously the military suffered a strong positivist influence that spread to the military schools. They became desirous of a strong republic headed by a dictator.\n\nDuring the Paraguayan War, the Brazilian military's contact with the reality of its South American neighbors led them to reflect on the relationship between political regimes and social problems. From this, a greater interest for the republican ideal and Brazilian economic and social development began to develop, both among the career military and among the civilians called to fight in the conflict.\n\nThus, it was no coincidence that Republican propaganda had, by its initial mark, the publication of the in 1870 (the year in which the Paraguayan War ended), followed by the in 1873 and the emergence of Republican clubs, which Have multiplied, since then, by the main centers in the country.\n\nIn addition, various groups were heavily influenced by Freemasonry (Deodoro da Fonseca was a Freemason, as well as his entire ministry) and Auguste Comte's positivism, especially after 1881, when the Positivist Church of Brazil emerged. Its directors, Miguel Lemos and Raimundo Teixeira Mendes, initiated a strong abolitionist and republican campaign.\n\nRepublican propaganda was carried out by what were later called \"historic Republicans\" (as opposed to those who became Republicans only after November 15, called \"Nov. 16 Republicans\").\n\nThe ideas of many of the republicans were published by the newspaper The Republic. According to some researchers, Republicans were divided into two main streams:\n\n\nAlthough there were differences between each of these groups as regards the political strategies for the implementation of the republic and also the substantive content of the regime to be established, the general idea common to both groups was that the republic should be a progressive, opposed to the \"exhausted\" monarchy. Thus, the proposal of the new regime was of a revolutionary social character and not only of a mere exchange of rulers.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, Republicans insisted that Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, a monarchist, head the revolutionary movement that would replace the monarchy with the republic.\n\nAfter much insistence from the revolutionaries, Deodoro da Fonseca agreed to lead the military movement.\n\nAccording to historical accounts, on November 15, 1889, commanding a few hundred soldiers moving through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Marshal Deodoro, as well as a large part of the military, intended only to overthrow the then Chief of the Imperial Cabinet (equivalent To the Prime Minister), the Viscount of Ouro Preto. \"The main culprits of all this [the proclamation of the Republic] are Count of Eu and the Viscount of Ouro Preto: the last to persecute the Army and the first to consent to this persecution,\" Deodoro later wrote.\n\nThe military coup, which was scheduled for November 20, 1889, had to be anticipated. On the 14th, the conspirators issued a rumor that the government had arrested Benjamin Constant Botelho de Magalhães and Deodoro da Fonseca. Later it was confirmed that it was even rumor. Thus, the revolutionaries anticipated the coup, and in the early hours of November 15, Deodoro was willing to lead the movement of army troops that put an end to the monarchist regime in Brazil.\n\nThe conspirators went to the residence of Marshal Deodoro, who was sick with dyspnea, and they finally convinced him to lead the movement. Apparently decisive for Deodoro was to know that, as of November 20, the new President of the Council of Ministers of the Empire would be Silveira Martins, an old rival. Deodoro and Silveira Martins had been enemies since the time when the marshal had served in Rio Grande do Sul, when both fought for the attention of the Baroness of Triunfo, a very beautiful and elegant widow who, according to the reports of the time, had preferred Silveira Martins. Since then, Silveira Martins did not miss an opportunity to provoke Deodoro from the Senate floor, insinuating that he misused funds and even challenging its effectiveness as a military.\n\nIn addition, Major Frederico Solon de Sampaio Ribeiro had told Deodoro that an alleged arrest warrant had been issued against him, a false argument that finally convinced the old marshal to proclaim the Republic on the 16th and to exile the Imperial Family by night, in order to avoid an eventual popular commotion.\n\nConvinced that he would be arrested by the imperial government, Deodoro left his residence at dawn on November 15, crossed the Campo de Santana, and on the other side of the park called the soldiers of the battalion there, where the Duke de Caxias Palace is now located, to rebel against the government. They offer a horse to the marshal, who rode on it, and, according to testimony, took off his hat and proclaimed \"Long live the Republic!\" Then he alighted, crossed the park again, and returned to his residence. The demonstration continued with a parade of troops on Direita street until the Imperial Palace. Recent studies indicate that Marshal Deodoro shouted \"Long live His Majesty the Emperor!\" however, for until then he was convinced to testify to the cabinet, not to proclaim the republic, and only did so when it was falsely told that his rival would take the Position.\n\nThe rioters occupied the headquarters of Rio de Janeiro and then the Ministry of War. They deposed the Cabinet and arrested their president, Afonso Celso de Assis Figueiredo, Viscount Ouro Preto.\n\nIn the Imperial Palace, Viscount de Ouro Preto, the president of the cabinet (prime minister), had been trying to resist asking the commander of the local detachment and responsible for the security of the Imperial Palace, General Floriano Peixoto, to confront the mutineers, explaining to General Floriano Peixoto that there were enough legalist troops on the scene to defeat the rioters. The Viscount of Ouro Preto reminded Floriano Peixoto that he had faced much more numerous troops in the Paraguayan War. However, General Floriano Peixoto refused to obey the orders given by the Viscount of Ouro Preto and thus justified his insubordination, responding to the Viscount of Ouro Preto:\n\nThen, adhering to the republican movement, Floriano Peixoto gave a prison sentence to the head of government.\n\nThe only one wounded in the episode of the proclamation of the republic was the Baron of Ladario, minister of navy, who resisted the arrest warrant given by the mutineers and was shot. It is said that Deodoro did not address criticism of the Emperor Pedro II and that he hesitated in his words. Despite this, it was known that Deodoro da Fonseca was with Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Constant at his side and that there were some civilian republican leaders at that time. But Deodoro favored the republic only after the death of the Emperor: \"I would like to carry the coffin of the Emperor,\" he said.\n\nOn the afternoon of November 15, at the City Hall of Rio de Janeiro, the Republic was solemnly proclaimed.\n\nAt night, in the Municipal Council of the Neutral Municipality, Rio de Janeiro, José do Patrocínio drafted the official proclamation of the Republic of the United States of Brazil, approved without a vote. The text went to the newspaper charts that supported the cause, and, only the next day, November 16, was announced to the people the change of the political regime of Brazil.\n\nPedro II, who was in Petrópolis, returned to Rio de Janeiro. Thinking that the aim of the revolutionaries was only to replace the office of Ouro Preto, the Emperor still tried to organize another ministerial cabinet, under the chairmanship of the councilor José Antônio Saraiva. The Emperor, in Petropolis, was informed and decided to go down to the Court. Upon learning of the coup, the Emperor acknowledged the fall of the Ouro Preto Cabinet and sought to announce a new name to replace the Viscount of Ouro Preto. However, since nothing had been said about Republic until then, the most exalted Republicans spread the rumor that the Emperor had chosen Gaspar Silveira Martins, political enemy of Deodoro da Fonseca since Rio Grande do Sul, to be the new head of government. Deodoro da Fonseca then persuaded himself to join the Republican cause. The Emperor was informed of this and, disillusioned, decided not to offer resistance.\n\nThe next day, Major Frederico Solon de Sampaio Ribeiro gave Pedro II a communication, informing him of the proclamation of the republic and ordering his departure for Europe, in order to avoid political upheavals. The Brazilian Imperial Family was exiled in Europe, only being allowed to return to Brazil in 1920 by President Epitácio Pessoa.\n\nDespite the lack of any will to resist from Pedro II, there was significant monarchist reaction after the fall of the Empire, which was thoroughly repressed. A few examples can be given. On 17 November 1889, upon hearing the news of the Emperor's fall, the 25th Infantry Battalion resisted by attacking the local Republican Club in Desterro (present-day Florianópolis). They were defeated by Republican militias and policemen and several were killed. Others were executed. According to the source, other battalions across the country also unsuccessfully fought against policemen and militias loyal to the Republic. In Rio de Janeiro, then-the Brazilian capital, on 18 November between 30 to 40 monarchist soldiers rebelled. Other monarchists rebellions occurred in Rio. On 18 December 1889, the 2nd Artillery Regiment – around 50 men – rebelled in a restorationist attempt. It led the government to ban freedom of the speech and exile or arrest several monarchist politicians. Another far more serious monarchist rebellion occurred on 14 January 1890, when 1 Cavalry Regiment, 2 Infantry Regiments and 1 Artillery Battalion attempted to overthrown the republic It had more than 100 casualties, and 21 officers and soldiers who took part of it were executed and more monarchist politicians were arrested.\n\nIn 1891 happened in Rio de Janeiro the so-called Revolta da Armada, a rebellion movement promoted by units of the Brazilian Navy against the dictatorial government of Deodoro da Fonseca, supposedly supported by the monarchist opposition to the recent installation of the republic, in which the navy threatened to bomb the federal capital. The Navy, still resented by circumstances and outcomes of the coup that had put an end to the monarchy in Brazil. Again between 1893 and 1894, before the dictatorship and the rights curtailment promoted by the government of Floriano Peixoto, the navy monarchist rebelled against the government. In that episode the Republicans had aid of the American navy to defeat the monarchists.\n\nA major civil war, that occurred from 1893 to 1895, between several monarchists and even republicans led by the monarchists leaders Gaspar da Silveira Martins, Custódio de Melo and Saldanha Da Gama against the republican government resulted in the death of 10,000 men.\n\nThe War of Canudos was a conflict between the state of Brazil and a group of some 30,000 settlers who had founded their own community in the Northeastern state of Bahia, named Canudos. After a number of unsuccessful attempts at military suppression, it came to a brutal end in October 1897, when a large Brazilian army force overran the village and killed nearly all the inhabitants. This was the deadliest civil war in Brazilian history. The community of Canudos was led by Antonio Conselheiro, in the interior of the state of Bahia against the great farmers supported by the Republican army. Rumors were created that Canudos was armed to attack neighboring towns and leave for the capital to depose the republican government and reinstall the monarchy. Only 300 survived the massacre caused by Republican Army troops in 1897 As a matter of comparison, the 1964–1985 Military dictatorship led to the death of 380 people\n\nAn event little known, but very interesting was the Revolt of Ribeirãozinho. Also called the Ribeirãozinho Revolution, it was a conservative movement of the early twentieth century that occurred in the city of Ribeirãozinho (now Taquaritinga), in São Paulo, and whose fundamental objective was the restoration of the monarchy and the coronation of Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza, son of Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil. Unhappy with the First Brazilian Republic, the São Paulo monarchists had planned an uprising that was supposed to take place on August 23, 1902, and which was to topple then President Campos Sales. In fact, the uprising had only been carried out in Ribeirãozinho and Espírito Santo do Pinhal, a neighboring town. This attempt to restore the monarchy lasted one day.\n\nIt is possible to challenge the legitimacy of the republic in Brazil from different angles.\n\nFrom the point of view of the , sanctioned on December 16, 1830, the crime committed by the Republicans was:\n\n\"Article 87: To try directly and by deeds to dethrone the Emperor, to deprive him of all or part of his constitutional authority, or to alter the legitimate order of succession, and imprisonment for five to fifteen years. Crime to be consummated: Fees of life imprisonment with work in the maximum degree, imprisonment with work for twenty years in the middle, and for a minimum of ten years.\n\nThe Viscount of Ouro Preto, deposed on November 15, understood that the proclamation of the republic had been a mistake and that the reign of Pedro II had been good, and this was expressed in his book \"Advent of the Military Dictatorship in Brazil\":\n\nThe movement of November 15, 1889 was not the first to seek the republic, although it was the only truly successful one, and according to some versions it would have had the support of both national and regional elites:\n\n\nAlthough there was no popular participation in the movement that ended with the monarchist regime and implanted the republic, there were also no popular demonstrations of support for the monarchy or repudiation of the new regime, although there was clear adoration and commotion toward the Emperor who was beloved and admired even by the republicans. The people seemed indifferent to the political course of the nation.\n\nSome researchers argue that, if the monarchy were popular, there would be moves against the republic then beyond the Canudos War and the Revolta da Armada. However, according to other researchers, what would have happened was a growing awareness about the new regime and the indifference by the most different sectors of Brazilian society. An opposing version is given by the researcher, Maria de Lourdes Monaco Janoti, in the book \"Os Subversivos da República\", in which she recounts the fear that the Republicans had in the first decades of the republic, regarding a possible restoration of the monarchy in Brazil. Maria Janoti also shows in her book the strong Republican repression of any attempt to organize monarchist political groups at that time.\n\nIn relation to the lack of popular participation in the November 15 movement, a document that had great repercussions was the article by Aristides Lobo, who was an eyewitness to the proclamation of the Republic, in the Popular \"Diário de São Paulo\", on November 18, in which Said:\n\nAt the meeting at the house of Deodoro, on the night of November 15, 1889, it was decided that a popular referendum would be held, so that the Brazilian people would vote for the republic, or not. However, this plebiscite only occurred 104 years later, as determined by article two of the Transitional Constitutional Provisions Act of 1988.\n"}

In the 1970s, a group of Sakuye moved to the Dabel hills, which lie below the Ethiopian plateau. The traditional camel-oriented rituals, with a nominal Muslim affiliation, became much less important after the destruction of the herds and the Sakuye became Husayniyya, followers of the Sufi order founded by Sheikh Hussein whose tomb lies in the village named for him in Bale, Ethiopia.

The Second Language Writing IS; it held its first meeting in Tampa in March 2006, covering topics ranging from “Broadening Perspectives in Second Language Writing” and “Alternative Placement Methods for Second Language Writers” to “Issues in Technologies for L2 Composition Classrooms” and “Crossing Bridges with Second Language Writing Partnerships.”\n\nAs these suggest, the section provides a forum for researchers and educators at different grade levels and institutional settings to discuss second language writing. Specifically, the section's goals are:\n\n\nThe section facilitates communication about writing across teaching levels and settings. Recent research on the scope of second language writing scholarship suggests that most of the field’s nationally (within the U.S.) and internationally circulated scholarship is produced by scholars in post-secondary education at research intensive institutions. Other contexts for writing (Pre-K through 12, two-year colleges, community programs, international K-12 schools, etc.) often have much larger populations of ELL/EFL writers, but scholars, particularly teacher-researchers, in these settings do not often receive support for researching and writing.\n\nGiven this, the section provides scholars with the opportunity to initiate more research and scholarship in these underrepresented contexts by supporting new collaborations and partnerships across levels and by providing a forum for discussing shared experiences. The section, like its parent body, TESOL, is distinctive in including all the academic levels and areas.\n\nSecond language writing scholars also participate in a Special Interest Group on the field at CCCC. In addition, the organization has a Committee on Second Language Writing to bridge work between CCCC and TESOL to involve more scholars in the field’s discussions.\n\nMuch recent attention focuses on the potential of Computer-mediated communication (CMC) to foster desire and opportunity to write.\n\nIn addition, attention has been focused on the practical application of teaching Second Language writing not only in academia but in the field. \n\nSecond language writing development has been investigated from many different perspectives. Manchón's edited book on \"L2 Writing Development: Multiple Perspectives\" provides an insight in which perspective second language writing development can be investigated. Her edited books includes studies on L2 writing development from Dynamic Systems Theory, Goal Theory, Genre-based Systemic functional linguistics, and Rhetorical genre theory.\n\nSecond language writing development has been most extensively investigated by traditional cross-sectional methodologies such as pre-test post-test designs.\n\nHowever, in the early 2000s a novel angle has emerged called Dynamical systems theory approach on Second language development. Studies adopting the DST perspective explore interactions between different constructs such as lexicon, syntax, and accuracy by using moving correlations. The degree of variability in the constructs is usually explored by min-max graphs, data resampling and Monte Carlo Analysis. Among the researchers who have adopted this new angle are Verspoor, de Bot, and Lowie. These researchers used a time-series data to investiagte development in second language writing.\n\nThe following is a list of researchers who contributed to the field of second language writing research.\n\n\nSecond language writing research uses different computational tools to investigate development. For example:\n\n\n"}

Over the years, with research done at the Department of Informatics of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, it evolved into a semiotic theory of human-computer interaction (HCI).\n\nSemiotic Engineering views HCI as computer-mediated communication between designers and users at interaction time. The system speaks for its designers in various types of conversations specified at design time. These conversations communicate the designers' understanding of who the users are, what they know the users want or need to do, in which preferred ways, and why. The designers' message to users includes even the interactive language in which users will have to communicate back with the system in order to achieve their specific goals. So, the process is in fact one of communication about communication, or metacommunication.\n\nSemiotic engineering has two methods to evaluate the quality of metacommunication in HCI: the semiotic inspection method (SIM) and the communicability evaluation method (CEM). In the 2009 book \"Semiotic Engineering Methods for Scientific Research in HCI\", Clarisse de Souza and Carla Leitão discuss how SIM and CEM, which are both qualitative methods, can also be used in scientific contexts to generate new knowledge about HCI. To illustrate their points, the authors present an extensive case study with a free open-source digital audio editor called Audacity. They show how the results obtained with a triangulation of SIM and CEM point at new research avenues not only for semiotic engineering and HCI but also for other areas of computer science such as software engineering and programming.\n\nRené Jorna and Clarisse de Souza independently developed two different kinds of ‘semiotic engineering.’ Jorna’s was originally closer to Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science. His ideas were later developed and applied to decision support systems and organizational semiotics rather than HCI. The authors were introduced to each other (and to each other's version of 'semiotic engineering') only in 1996, in a Dagstuhl Seminar on Informatics and Semiotics organized by Peter B. Andersen, Mihai Nadin and Frieder Nake.\n\n"}

Some lightweight versions may be fitted with an elastic neck strap to hold them in place while freeing the user's hands for other tasks. The purpose of a stenomask is to allow a person to speak without being heard by other people, and to keep background noise away from the microphone. \n\nA stenomask is useful for speech recognition applications, because it allows voice transcription in noisy environments. Perhaps more importantly, a stenomask silences the user's voice so that it does not interfere with the surrounding environment such as a court or a classroom. The user can verbally identify the speaker, indicate gestures and unspoken answers, and describe activities as they take place.\n\nAn operator of a stenomask can be trained to \"re-voice\" everything he or she hears into a stenomask connected to a speech recognition system, for a real-time text transcription of everything spoken. This allows a \"voice writer\" to produce instant text feeds within a courtroom and distribute them in plain text format immediately after a proceeding. The equipment can also interface with litigation management software.\n\nA trained operator using a stenomask connected to a pre-trained speech recognition system can exceed 180 words per minute while at the same time exceeding 95 percent accuracy. They may also modify the pronunciation of the words they are speaking in order to improve accuracy.\n\nMicrophones that work much like a stenomask are used by aircraft ground crews to communicate with cockpit crews in airport environments with extreme engine noise, and are usually part of their headsets.\n\nThe stenomask was developed by Horace Webb and two colleagues in the early 1940s. He was proficient with Gregg shorthand, but sought a more accurate and faster system of transcription, as shorthand notes can become unmanageable with fast talkers or difficult terminology. Furthermore, until recently, shorthand reporters would verbally dictate transcription notes into typewritten form, resulting in about two hours dictation for every hour transcribing.\n\nThus, Webb thought he could \"repeat it with my voice instead of with a pen\". After much experimentation — first with a cigar box and then a tomato juice can — he arrived at a solution using a microphone inside a military aviator's rubber oxygen mask, paired with a coffee pot filled with sound-absorbing material. The result was eventually deemed by the United States Navy to be the most accurate method of transcription among \"all known systems of verbatim reporting\", and was subsequently adopted for use in their court reporting.\n\n"}
{"id": "14644243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14644243", "title": "Taxonomic rank", "text": "Taxonomic rank\n\nIn biological classification, taxonomic rank is the relative level of a group of organisms (a taxon) in a taxonomic hierarchy. Examples of taxonomic ranks are species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain, etc.\n\nA given rank subsumes under it less general categories, that is, more specific descriptions of life forms. Above it, each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of traits or features from common ancestors. The rank of any \"species\" and the description of its \"genus\" is \"basic\"; which means that to identify a particular organism, it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two.\n\nConsider a particular species, the red fox, \"Vulpes vulpes\": the next rank above, the genus \"Vulpes\", comprises all the \"true\" foxes. Their closest relatives are in the immediately higher rank, the family Canidae, which includes dogs, wolves, jackals, and all foxes; the next higher rank, the order Carnivora, includes caniforms (bears, seals, weasels, skunks, raccoons and all those mentioned above), and feliforms (cats, civets, hyenas, mongooses). Carnivorans are one group of the hairy, warm-blooded, nursing members of the class Mammalia, which are classified among animals with backbones in the phylum Chordata, and with them among all animals in the kingdom Animalia. Finally, at the highest rank all of these are grouped together with all other organisms possessing cell nuclei in the domain Eukarya.\n\nThe \"International Code of Zoological Nomenclature\" defines \"rank\" as: \"The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily).\"\n\nIn his landmark publications, such as the \"Systema Naturae\", Carl Linnaeus used a ranking scale limited to: kingdom, class, order, genus, species, and one rank below species. Today, nomenclature is regulated by the nomenclature codes. There are seven main taxonomic ranks: kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus, species. In addition, \"domain\" (proposed by Carl Woese) is now widely used as a fundamental rank, although it is not mentioned in any of the nomenclature codes, and is a synonym for dominion (lat. dominium), introduced by Moore in 1974.\n\nA taxon is usually assigned a rank when it is given its formal name. The basic ranks are species and genus. When an organism is given a species name it is assigned to a genus, and the genus name is part of the species name.\n\nThe species name is also called a binomial, that is, a two-term name. For example, the zoological name for the human species is \"Homo sapiens\". This is usually italicized in print and underlined when italics are not available. In this case, \"Homo\" is the generic name and it is capitalized; \"sapiens\" indicates the species and it is not capitalized.\n\nThere are definitions of the following taxonomic ranks in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature: superfamily, family, subfamily, tribe, subtribe, genus, subgenus, species, subspecies.\n\nThe International Code of Zoological Nomenclature divides names into \"family-group names\", \"genus-group names\" and \"species-group names\". The Code explicitly mentions the following ranks for these categories:\n\n\"Family\"\n\n\"Genus\"\n\"Species\"\n\nThe rules in the Code apply to the ranks of superfamily to subspecies, and only to some extent to those above the rank of superfamily. Among \"genus-group names\" and \"species-group names\" no further ranks are officially allowed. Zoologists sometimes use additional terms such as \"species group\", \"species subgroup\", \"species complex\" and \"superspecies\" for convenience as extra, but unofficial, ranks between the subgenus and species levels in taxa with many species, e.g. the genus \"Drosophila\". (Note the potentially confusing use of \"species group\" as both a category of ranks as well as an unofficial rank itself.)\n\nAt higher ranks (family and above) a lower level may be denoted by adding the prefix \"infra\", meaning \"lower\", to the rank. For example, \"infra\"order (below suborder) or \"infra\"family (below subfamily).\n\n\nAccording to Art 3.1 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) the most important ranks of taxa are: kingdom, division or phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. According to Art 4.1 the secondary ranks of taxa are tribe, section, series, variety and form. There is an indeterminate number of ranks. The ICN explicitly mentions:\nprimary ranks\nkingdom (\"regnum\")\n\ndivision or phylum (\"divisio\", \"phylum\")\n\nclass (\"classis\")\n\norder (\"ordo\")\nfamily (\"familia\")\n\ngenus (\"genus\")\n\nspecies (\"species\")\n\nThere are definitions of the following taxonomic categories in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants: cultivar group, cultivar, grex.\n\nThe rules in the ICN apply primarily to the ranks of family and below, and only to some extent to those above the rank of family. Also see descriptive botanical names.\n\nTaxa at the rank of genus and above have a botanical name in one part (unitary name); those at the rank of species and above (but below genus) have a botanical name in two parts (binary name); all taxa below the rank of species have a botanical name in three parts (an infraspecific name). To indicate the rank of the infraspecific name, a \"connecting term\" is needed. Thus \"Poa secunda\" subsp. \"juncifolia\", where \"subsp.\" is an abbreviation for \"subspecies\", is the name of a subspecies of \"Poa secunda\".\n\nHybrids can be specified either by a \"hybrid formula\" that specifies the parentage, or may be given a name. For hybrids receiving a hybrid name, the same ranks apply, prefixed with \"notho\" (Greek: 'bastard'), with nothogenus as the highest permitted rank.\n\nIf a different term for the rank was used in an old publication, but the intention is clear, botanical nomenclature specifies certain substitutions:\n\nClassifications of five species follow: the fruit fly familiar in genetics laboratories (\"Drosophila melanogaster\"), humans (\"Homo sapiens\"), the peas used by Gregor Mendel in his discovery of genetics (\"Pisum sativum\"), the \"fly agaric\" mushroom \"Amanita muscaria\", and the bacterium \"Escherichia coli\". The eight major ranks are given in bold; a selection of minor ranks are given as well.\n\n\nTaxa above the genus level are often given names based on the type genus, with a standard termination. The terminations used in forming these names depend on the kingdom (and sometimes the phylum and class) as set out in the table below.\n\nPronunciations given are the most Anglicized. More Latinate pronunciations are also common, particularly rather than for stressed \"a\".\n\n\nThere is an indeterminate number of ranks, as a taxonomist may invent a new rank at will, at any time, if they feel this is necessary. In doing so, there are some restrictions, which will vary with the nomenclature code which applies.\n\nThe following is an artificial synthesis, solely for purposes of demonstration of relative rank (but see notes), from most general to most specific:\n\nRanks are assigned based on subjective dissimilarity, and do not fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: not because the rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists. Furthermore, some groups have many described species not because they are more diverse than other species, but because they are more easily sampled and studied than other group.\n\nOf these many ranks, the most basic is species. However, this is not to say that a taxon at any other rank may not be sharply defined, or that any species is guaranteed to be sharply defined. It varies from case to case. Ideally, a taxon is intended to represent a clade, that is, the phylogeny of the organisms under discussion, but this is not a requirement.\n\nClassification, in which all taxa have formal ranks, cannot adequately reflect knowledge about phylogeny; at the same time, if taxon names are dependent on ranks, rank-free taxa can't be supplied with names. This problem is dissolved in cladoendesis, where the specially elaborated rank-free nomenclatures are used.\n\nThere are no rules for how many species should make a genus, a family, or any other higher taxon (that is, a taxon in a category above the species level). It should be a natural group (that is, non-artificial, non-polyphyletic), as judged by a biologist, using all the information available to them. Equally ranked higher taxa in different phyla are not necessarily equivalent (e.g., it is incorrect to assume that families of insects are in some way evolutionarily comparable to families of mollusks). For animals, at least the phylum rank is usually associated with a certain body plan, which is also, however, an arbitrary criterion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20345678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20345678", "title": "Telephone interpreting", "text": "Telephone interpreting\n\nTelephone interpreting is a service that connects human interpreters via telephone to individuals who wish to speak to each other but do not share a common language. The telephone interpreter converts the spoken language from one language to another, enabling listeners and speakers to understand each other. Interpretation over the telephone most often takes place in consecutive mode, which means that the interpreter waits until the speaker finishes an utterance before rendering the interpretation into the other language.\n\nTelephone interpreting is one modality or delivery mechanism for providing interpreting services. Other forms of delivering interpreting services include in-person interpreting and video interpreting for the deaf and hard of hearing.\n\n\nThere are many types of organizations that provide telephone interpreting services, including for-profit companies, governmental organizations, non-profit groups, and internal divisions within organizations. For example, the government of Australia operates a telephone interpreting service, as do the governments of South Africa and New Zealand.\n\nIn the United States, telephone interpreting is widely used by its federal courts. Numerous commercial providers are also available and commonly used. Many of the commercial telephone interpreting providers connect users with interpreters for more than 150 languages. Some providers claim to have the ability to connect an interpreter at any time of day, within a matter of seconds. Some hospitals and health care systems also provide telephone interpreting services.\n\nMajor providers of telephone interpretation in the United States include Language Line Services, CyraCom International and Pacific Interpreters. In 2009, CyraCom was the second largest supplier of telephone interpretation in the world behind Language Line Services ranked #1, while Pacific Interpreters was the fifth largest.\n\nIn 2013, Language Line Services acquired Pacific Interpreters.\n\nLanguage Line Inc. is an American commercial interpreting provider that in 2006 acquired a UK charity of the same name: British social activist Michael Young noticed that language barriers were leading to substandard services for ethnic minorities at Royal London Hospital, so he obtained grant funding to provide free telephone interpreters starting in 1990. Police on the Isle of Dogs became his second client, and he later began serving corporate clients and converted the charity into a commercial service.\n\nThere is now a prevalence of companies that offer this service, many on a more global basis which is a natural benefit of \"virtualising\" interpretation. Similarly to translation, the diversity of organisations cover generic interpretation, as well as domain-specific services such as legal, medical, pharmaceutical and other technical.\n\nUsers typically access telephone interpreting services with a telephone or computer with VoIP. However, if the two parties wishing to communicate are in the same location, using a dual handset phone, a phone with two receivers, can relieve the two parties from passing a phone back and forth. Speakerphones are also sometimes used, but these can create challenges both in terms of confidentiality, and for the interpreter, especially due to background noise, which can hinder the interpreter's ability to hear.\n\nWhere one party is deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired, communication via an off-site sign language interpreter can be performed using a video link using the necessary video telecommunication equipment.\n\nThe provisioning of telephone interpreting generally fits into two main categories:\n\n\nAdditionally, some of the companies that have the required capability will offer a hybrid of the two principles, where for example a customer can:\n\nTelephone interpreting is widely used in a number of settings, including health care, government, financial, emergency telephone call centres (e.g. '9-1-1' or '1-1-2'), and others. Telephone interpreting is especially helpful for settings in which the two parties would communicate via telephone anyway, such as interactions between call centers and consumers, calls between members of the public and emergency telephone call centres, etc. Telephone interpreting can be used to take applications over the phone and help individuals with account issues.\n\nTelephone interpretation via Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) or a Video Relay Service (VRS) are also useful where one of the parties is deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired. In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as French Sign Language (FSL) to spoken French, Spanish Sign Language (SSL) to spoken Spanish, British Sign Language (BSL) to spoken English, and American Sign Language (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct), etc. Multilingual sign language interpreters, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as to and from SSL, to and from spoken English), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the translator, since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction and syntax, which are different from the aural version of the same principal language.\n\nIn 2007, the global telephone interpreting market was worth $700 million, with an estimated $500 million generated in the United States. Industry analyst firm Common Sense Advisory estimates that in 2012, the market will be worth $1.2 billion, an increase of 70% from 2007. The market for telephone interpreting is global in scope and includes companies from the United States, the Netherlands, Sweden, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, India, China, Norway, Spain, and Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1393859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1393859", "title": "Travel literature", "text": "Travel literature\n\nThe genre of travel literature encompasses outdoor literature, guide books, nature writing, and travel memoirs.\n\nOne early travel memoirist in Western literature was Pausanias, a Greek geographer of the 2nd century AD. In the early modern period, James Boswell's \"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides\" (1786) helped shape travel memoir as a genre.\n\nEarly examples of travel literature include Pausanias' \"Description of Greece\" in the 2nd century CE, the \"Journey Through Wales\" (1191) and \"Description of Wales\" (1194) by Gerald of Wales, and the travel journals of Ibn Jubayr (1145–1214) and Ibn Battuta (1304–1377), both of whom recorded their travels across the known world in detail. The travel genre was a fairly common genre in medieval Arabic literature.\n\nTravel literature became popular during the Song dynasty (960–1279) of medieval China. The genre was called 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), and was often written in narrative, prose, essay and diary style. Travel literature authors such as Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Xu Xiake (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of geographical and topographical information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' \"Record of Stone Bell Mountain\" by the noted poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.\n\nOne of the earliest known records of taking pleasure in travel, of travelling for the sake of travel and writing about it, is Petrarch's (1304–1374) ascent of Mount Ventoux in 1336. He states that he went to the mountaintop for the pleasure of seeing the top of the famous height. His companions who stayed at the bottom he called \"frigida incuriositas\" (\"a cold lack of curiosity\"). He then wrote about his climb, making allegorical comparisons between climbing the mountain and his own moral progress in life.\n\nMichault Taillevent, a poet for the Duke of Burgundy, travelled through the Jura Mountains in 1430 and recorded his personal reflections, his horrified reaction to the sheer rock faces, and the terrifying thunderous cascades of mountain streams. Antoine de la Sale (c. 1388–c. 1462), author of \"Petit Jehan de Saintre\", climbed to the crater of a volcano in the Lipari Islands in 1407, leaving us with his impressions. \"Councils of mad youth\" were his stated reasons for going. In the mid-15th century, Gilles le Bouvier, in his \"Livre de la description des pays\", gave us his reason to travel and write:\n\nIn 1589, Richard Hakluyt (c. 1552–1616) published \"Voyages\", a foundational text of the travel literature genre.\n\nIn the 18th Century, travel literature was commonly known as the book of travels, which mainly consisted of maritime diaries. In 18th century Britain, almost every famous writer worked in the travel literature form. Captain James Cook's diaries (1784) were the equivalent of today's best sellers Alexander von Humboldt's \"Personal narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of America, during the years 1799–1804\", originally published in French, was translated to multiple languages and influenced later naturalists, including Charles Darwin.\n\nOther later examples of travel literature include accounts of the Grand Tour. Aristocrats, clergy, and others with money and leisure time travelled Europe to learn about the art and architecture of its past. One tourism literature pioneer was Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894), with \"An Inland Voyage\" (1878), and \"Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes\" (1879) about his travels in the Cévennes, (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first sleeping bags.\n\nTravel books come in styles ranging from the documentary, to the literary, as well as the journalistic, and from the humorous to the serious. They are often associated with tourism and include guide books. Travel writing may be found on web sites, in periodicals, and in books. It has been produced by a variety of writers, including travelers, military officers, missionaries, explorers, scientists, pilgrims, social and physical scientists, educators, and migrants. Englishmen Eric Newby, H. V. Morton, the Americans Bill Bryson and Paul Theroux, and Welsh author Jan Morris are or were widely acclaimed as travel writers (though Morris has frequently claimed herself as a writer of 'place' rather than travel \"per se\"). Bill Bryson in 2011 won the Golden Eagle Award from the Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild. On 22 November 2012, Durham University officially renamed the Main Library the Bill Bryson Library for his contributions as the university's 11th chancellor (2005–11). Paul Theroux was awarded the 1981 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel \"The Mosquito Coast\", which was adapted for the 1986 movie of the same name. He was also awarded in 1989 the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award for \"Riding the Iron Rooster\". In 2005, Jan Morris was awarded the Golden PEN Award by English PEN for \"a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature\".\n\nTravel literature often intersects with essay writing, as in V. S. Naipaul's \"\" (1976), whose trip became the occasion for extended observations on a nation and people. This is similarly the case in Rebecca West's work on Yugoslavia, \"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\" (1941).\n\nSometimes a writer will settle into a locality for an extended period, absorbing a sense of place while continuing to observe with a travel writer's sensibility. Examples of such writings include Lawrence Durrell's \"Bitter Lemons\" (1957), Deborah Tall's \"The Island of the White Cow: Memories of an Irish Island\" (1986), and Peter Mayle's best-selling \"A Year in Provence\" (1989) and its sequels.\n\nTravel and nature writing merge in many of the works by Sally Carrighar, Gerald Durrell and Ivan T. Sanderson. Sally Carrighar's works include \"One Day at Teton Marsh\" (1965), \"Home to the Wilderness\" (1973), and \"Wild Heritage\" (1965). Gerald Durrell's \"My Family and Other Animals\" (1956) is an autobiographical work by the British naturalist. It tells of the years that he lived as a child with his siblings and widowed mother on the Greek island of Corfu between 1935 and 1939. It describes the life of the Durrell family in a humorous manner, and explores the fauna of the island. It is the first and most well-known of Durrell's \"Corfu trilogy\", together with \"Birds, Beasts, and Relatives\" and \"The Garden of the Gods\" (1978). Ivan T. Sanderson published \"Animal Treasure\", a report of an expedition to the jungles of then-British West Africa; \"Caribbean Treasure\", an account of an expedition to Trinidad, Haiti, and Surinam, begun in late 1936 and ending in late 1938; and \"Living Treasure\", an account of an expedition to Jamaica, British Honduras (now Belize) and the Yucatán. These authors are naturalists, who write in support of their fields of study. Another naturalist, Charles Darwin, wrote his famous account of the journey of HMS \"Beagle\" at the intersection of science, natural history and travel.\n\nA number of writers famous in other fields have written about their travel experiences. Examples are Samuel Johnson's \"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland\" (1775); Charles Dickens' \"American Notes for General Circulation\" (1842); Mary Wollstonecraft's \"Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark\" (1796); Hilaire Belloc's \"The Path To Rome\" (1902); D. H. Lawrence's \"Twilight in Italy and Other Essays\" (1916); \"Mornings in Mexico and Other Essays\" (1927); Rebecca West's \"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\" (1941); and John Steinbeck's \"\" (1962).\n\nIn the world of sailing Joshua Slocum's \"Sailing Alone Around the World\" (1900) is a classic of outdoor adventure literature. In April 1895, Joshua Slocum set sail from Boston, Massachusetts and in \"Sailing Alone Around the World\", he described his departure in the following manner:\n\nMore than three years later, on June 27, 1898, Slocum returned to Newport, Rhode Island, having circumnavigated the world.\n\nA guide book or travel guide is \"a book of information about a place, designed for the use of visitors or tourists\". An early example is Thomas West's guide to the Lake District, published in 1778. Thomas West, an English priest, popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the Lake District of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed: to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations. To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities. Published in 1778 the book was a major success.\nIt will usually include full details relating to accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities. Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are also often included. Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from adventure travel to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet. Travel guides can also take the form of travel websites.\n\nA travel journal, also called road journal, is a record made by a traveller, sometimes in diary form, of the traveler's experiences, written during the course of the journey and later edited for publication. This is a long-established literary format; an early example is the writing of Pausanias (2nd century AD) who produced his \"Description of Greece\" based on his own observations. James Boswell published his \"The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides\" in 1786 and Goethe published his \"Italian Journey\", based on diaries, in 1816. Fannie Calderón de la Barca, the Scottish-born wife of the Spanish ambassador to Mexico 1839–1842, wrote \"Life in Mexico\", an important travel narrative of her time there, with many observations of local life. A British traveller, Mrs Alec Tweedie, published a number of travelogues, ranging from Denmark (1895) and Finland (1897), to the U.S. (1913), several on Mexico (1901, 1906, 1917), and one on Russia, Siberia, and China (1926). A more recent example is Che Guevara's \"The Motorcycle Diaries\". A travelogue is a film, book written up from a travel diary, or illustrated talk describing the experiences of and places visited by traveller. American writer Paul Theroux has published many works of travel literature, the first success being \"The Great Railway Bazaar\". Anglo-American Bill Bryson is known for \"A Walk in the Woods\", made into a Hollywood film of the same name.\n\nSome fictional travel stories are related to travel literature. Although it may be desirable in some contexts to distinguish fictional from non-fictional works, such distinctions have proved notoriously difficult to make in practice, as in the famous instance of the travel writings of Marco Polo or John Mandeville. Examples of fictional works of travel literature based on actual journeys are: \n\nIn the 21st century, travel literature became a genre of social media in the form of travel blogs, with travel bloggers using outlets like personal blogs, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to convey information about their adventures, and provide advice for navigating particular countries, or for traveling generally. Travel blogs were among the first instances of blogging, which began in the mid 1990s.. In 2018 the most popular self hosted blogging platform is WordPress, due to its ease of use.\n\nThe systematic study of travel literature emerged as a field of scholarly inquiry in the mid-1990s, with its own conferences, organizations, journals, monographs, anthologies, and encyclopedias. Important, pre-1995 monographs are: \"Abroad\" (1980) by Paul Fussell, an exploration of British interwar travel writing as escapism; \"Gone Primitive: Modern Intellects, Savage Minds\" (1990) by Marianna Torgovnick, an inquiry into the primitivist presentations of foreign cultures; \"Haunted Journeys: Desire and Transgression in European Travel Writing\" (1991) by Dennis Porter, a close look at the psychological correlatives of travel; \"Discourses of Difference: An Analysis of Women's Travel Writing\" by Sara Mills, an inquiry into the intersection of gender and colonialism during the 19th century; \"Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation\" (1992), Mary Louise Pratt's influential study of Victorian travel writing's dissemination of a colonial mind-set; and \"Belated Travelers\" (1994), an analysis of colonial anxiety by Ali Behdad.\n\nDisrupting the assumptions of traditional travel writing, Amitav Ghosh's \"In an Antique Land\" may be regarded as an example of \"counter travel narrative\", reversing the \"roles of traveller and local, viewing the present as contextualized by the colonial and precolonial past, and eschewing definitive authorial authority [in] a powerful rebuttal to the ideology of the traditional travel text.\"\n\nPrizes awarded annually for travel books have included the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award, which ran from 1980 to 2004, the Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature, and the Dolman Best Travel Book Award, which began in 2006. The North American Travel Journalists Association holds an annual awards competition honoring travel journalism in a multitude of categories, ranging across print and online media.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18112665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18112665", "title": "Vancouverism", "text": "Vancouverism\n\nVancouverism is an urban planning and architectural phenomenon in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It is characterized by a large residential population living in the city centre with mixed-use developments, typically with a medium-height, commercial base and narrow, high-rise residential towers, significant reliance on mass public transit, creation and maintenance of green park spaces, and preserving view corridors. \n\nBeing consistently ranked among the most livable cities in the world has urban planners flocking to the city to attempt to try to emulate and implement on their own city. An article in San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association has taken note of Vancouver's approach to new development and view corridors and asks if San Francisco should pursue similar direction.\n\nArchitect Bing Thom described Vancouverism this way:\nIt's a spirit about public space. I think Vancouverites are very, very proud that we built a city that really has a tremendous amount of space on the waterfront for people to recreate and to enjoy.\n\nAt the same time, False Creek and Coal Harbour were previously industrial lands that were very polluted and desecrated. We've refreshed all of this with new development, and people have access to the water and the views. So, to me, it's this idea of having a lot people living very close together, mixing the uses. So, we have apartments on top of stores. In Surrey we have a university on top of a shopping centre. This mixing of uses reflects Vancouver in terms of our culture and how we live together.\n\nAn important aspect to note is that Vancouverism is an ideal that was developed in Vancouver but is not present in all regions of the city of Vancouver. Additionally, while outlying regions of Metro Vancouver, such as Surrey, has adopted aspects of these ideals, they did not originate outside the city of Vancouver.\n\nVancouverism developed in part as a product of Vancouver's geographical context. Wedged between the sea, mountains and the border with the United States, the Greater Vancouver Regional District partnered with the area's municipalities to encourage controlled development. Early recognition that British Columbia's farmland would be engulfed by sprawl led to the establishment of the Agricultural Land Reserve in the 1970s. This assisted in containing and intensifying development throughout the Vancouver metropolitan area and the Fraser Valley.\n\nArchitect Arthur Erickson is credited by some with developing the concept that became Vancouverism in the mid-1950s, in a never-realized development called \"Project 56\". Many of the principles were incorporated into the development of the West End. The city's planning department, under the direction of Ray Spaxman in the 1980s, began to expand on the concepts, many of which were brought into fruition with the development of the former Expo 86 lands along False Creek and Yaletown.\n\nAnother person who is credited with influencing Vancouverism is Jane Jacobs, author of \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\". Brent Toderian, the former head of Planning for the City of Vancouver says of Jacobs: “There isn't a person or book more influential in creating ‘Vancouverism' than Jane and The Death and Life”... “I know what she means about people misunderstanding density – that's why we emphasize density done well rather than density as a mathematical exercise. [But] people 'round the world praise Vancouver's livability, and she had a big hand in it.”\n\nOne principle associated with Vancouverism, as evidenced by planning policy, involves protecting \"view corridors\". Vancouver's \"View Protection Guidelines\" were approved in 1989 and amended in 1990, establishing height limits to protect views of the North Shore Mountains. This approach, while credited with preserving the city's scenic backdrop, has been criticized for lessening visual interest and failing to represent the city's contemporary image. In response, Council commissioned a \"Skyline Study\" in 1997 which concluded that Vancouver's skyline would benefit from the addition of a handful of buildings exceeding current height limits, to add visual interest to Vancouver's skyline.\n\nA study found that opportunities for such buildings were restricted due to a limited number of large development sites in the downtown. Eight years later, five of the seven sites identified for higher buildings had been planned or developed. The tallest of the new buildings is the Living Shangri-La hotel/residential tower, which was completed in 2008, and stands 201 metres (659 ft) tall (62 stories).\n\nThe fine-meshed urban grid with mid-block lanes, has allowed the city to easily densify and promotes walkability. The overhead, visible, grade separated SkyTrain (Vancouver) transit system is an integral part of the aesthetic of Vancouverism, as it promotes a healthy lifestyle.\n\nOne of the circumstances allowing the development of Vancouverism was the discretionary planning process implemented by the city. The planning process of Vancouver is based on collaboration by aligning the development goals of the city prior to determining the particular actions for individual drivers. Following the extended public outcry over a freeway and development program known as Project 200, Vancouver voted the Elector's Action Movement (TEAM) into power. TEAM ran on a platform of implementing more stringent design criteria and oversight to city developments. Development along South False Creek is the ideal urban form advocated by TEAM. The South False Creek development is characterized by low-density, mixed use and mixed-income residential properties with a high level of access to amenities. As well as favouring the urban form found along South False Creek, TEAM implemented significant reforms to the planning process. Discretionary planning allows the automatic approval of small developments that conform to the existing building codes. Larger projects are subject to the design review of the planning department. The planning department is empowered to make decisions that will force developments to conform to certain design guidelines.\n\nSustainable development refers to solutions that not only benefit the present population, but also the future generations as well. This type of development requires looking at the consequences of decisions, which lead to solutions, and the consequences of those consequences too. Vancouver planners have been looking ahead of their current problems and solutions for decades. An example of this foresight can be seen in Vancouver’s zoning regulations maintaining set-backs and sight-lines; and rejecting the downtown freeway, in which the city sacrificed initial gains for smaller long-term benefits and neighbourhood preservation—a trade-off that benefit current residents and later generations as well. Current issues revolve around finite energy sources and their impacts on the environment. These problems have led Vancouver to outline a growth strategy that considers the environment and community.\n\n\n"}

He was the younger son of Vallabhacharya, who founded the Pushtimarg religious sect of Hinduism.\n\nThe name Vitthalanatha is also pronounced as Vitthalnath in modern vernaculars because of schwa deletion. His other names include Vitthaleshvara (IAST: Viṭṭhaleśvara), Vitthala Dikshita, or Agnikumara. In addition, he is known by the title \"Gosvami\" (Gosain-ji or Gusain-ji).\n\nVitthalanatha was born around 1516 (between 1515 and 1518), as the second son of the religious scholar Vallabha.\n\nHis devotees consider him an incarnation of the god Vitthal of Pandharpur. He was brought up by Vallabha till the age of 15, and after that, by Vallabha's disciple Damodara-dasa.\n\nHe was proficient in the Vedas, the Brahma Sutra, and the Mimansa philosophy. He studied \"nyaya\" at Navadvipa.\n\nAfter the deaths of his father Vallabhacharya (c. 1530), his elder brother Gopinatha, and Gopinatha's son Purushottama (c. 1550), Vitthalanatha emerged as the main leader of the religious sect established by his father. Initially, he faced some opposition from other leaders of the sect, including Krishnadasa, a manager of the Shrinathji Temple. Krishnadasa banned Vitthalanatha from entering the temple because of personal disputes, but later, reconciled with him. Vitthalanatha forgave him, and made him in-charge of the Govardhan Hill temple.\n\nVitthalanatha propagated the teachings of his father, and established a religious centre at Gokul.\n\nThe texts and commentaries attributed to Vitthala include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "147533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147533", "title": "Yue Chinese", "text": "Yue Chinese\n\nYue or Yueh ( or ; ) is one of the primary branches of Chinese spoken in southern China, particularly the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, collectively known as Liangguang.\n\nThe name Cantonese is often used for the whole branch, but linguists prefer to reserve that name for the variety of Guangzhou (Canton), Hong Kong and Macau, which is the prestige dialect. Taishanese, from the coastal area of Jiangmen located southwest of Guangzhou, was the language of most of the 19th-century emigrants from Guangdong to Southeast Asia and North America. Most later migrants have been speakers of Cantonese.\n\nYue varieties are not mutually intelligible with other varieties of Chinese. They are among the most conservative varieties with regard to the final consonants and tonal categories of Middle Chinese, but have lost several distinctions in the initial and medial consonants that other Chinese varieties have retained.\n\nThe prototypical use of the name \"Cantonese\" in English is for the Yue variety of Guangzhou (Canton), but it is also used for Yue as a whole. To avoid confusion, academic texts may call the primary branch of Chinese \"Yue\", following the Mandarin pinyin spelling, and either restrict \"Cantonese\" to its common usage for the Guangzhou variety, or avoid the term \"Cantonese\" altogether and distinguish Yue from Guangzhou (Canton) dialect.\n\nIn Chinese, people of Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Cantonese immigrants abroad, usually call their language \"Gwóngdūng wá\" (廣東話) \"speech of Guangdong\". The people of Guangdong and Guangxi do not use that term, but rather \"Yuht Yúh\" (粵語) \"Yue language\". They also use \"baahk wá\" () on its own to refer to the Guangzhou dialect. It is also used in Guangxi to refer to Yue varieties, as for example in an expression like \"南寧白話\", which means the \"\"baak waa\" of Nanning\".\n\nThe area of China south of the Nanling Mountains, known as the Lingnan (roughly modern Guangxi and Guangdong), was originally home to peoples known to the Chinese as the Hundred Yue (Baiyue). Large-scale Han Chinese migration to the area began after the Qin conquest of the region in 214 BC. Successive waves of immigration followed at times of upheaval in Northern and Central China, such as the collapse of the Han, Tang and Song dynasties. The most popular route was via the Xiang River, which the Qin had connected to the Li River by the Lingqu Canal, and then into the valley of the Xi Jiang (West River). A secondary route followed the Gan River and then the Bei Jiang (North River) into eastern Guangdong. Yue-speakers were later joined by Hakka-speakers following the North River route, and Min-speakers arriving by sea.\n\nAfter the fall of Qin, the Lingnan area was part of the independent state of Nanyue for about a century, before being incorporated in the Han empire in 111 BC. After the Tang dynasty collapsed, much of the area became part of the state of Southern Han, one of the longest-lived states of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, between 917 and 971.\n\nLarge waves of Chinese migration throughout succeeding Chinese dynasties assimilated huge numbers of Yue aborigines, with the result that today's Southern Han Chinese Yue-speaking population is descended from both groups. The colloquial layers of Yue varieties contain elements influenced by the Tai languages formerly spoken widely in the area and still spoken by people such as the Zhuang or the Dong.\n\nThe port city of Guangzhou lies in the middle of Pearl River Delta, with access to the interior via the West River, North River and East River, which all converge at the delta. It has been the economic centre of the Lingnan region since Qin times, when it was an important shipbuilding centre. By 660, it was the largest port in China, part of a trade network stretching as far as Arabia. During the Southern Song, it also became the cultural centre of the region. Like many other Chinese varieties it developed a distinct literary layer associated with the local tradition of reading the classics. The Guangzhou dialect (Cantonese) was used in the popular \"Yuèōu\", \"Mùyú\" and \"Nányīn\" folksong genres, as well as Cantonese opera.\nThere was also a small amount of vernacular literature, written with Chinese characters extended with a number of non-traditional characters for Cantonese words.\n\nGuangzhou became the centre of rapidly expanding foreign trade after the maritime ban was lifted, with the British East India Company establishing a chamber of commerce in the city in 1715.\nThe ancestors of most of the Han Chinese population of Hong Kong came from Guangzhou after the territory was ceded to Britain in 1842. As a result, Hong Kong Cantonese, the most widely spoken language in Hong Kong and Macau, is an offshoot of the Guangzhou dialect. The popularity of Cantonese-language media, Cantopop and the Cinema of Hong Kong has since led to substantial exposure of Cantonese to China and the rest of Asia. On the Mainland, the national policy is to promote Standard Chinese, which is also the medium of instruction in schools. The place of local Cantonese language and culture remains contentious. In 2010, a controversial proposal to switch some programming on Guangzhou local television from Cantonese to Mandarin was abandoned following widespread backlash accompanied by public protests.\n\nYue varieties are spoken in the southern provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, an area long dominated culturally and economically by the city of Guangzhou (Canton) at the delta of the Pearl River. The Cantonese variety, also spoken in Hong Kong and Macau, is the prestige variety of Yue.\n\nThe influence of Guangzhou has spread westward along the Pearl River system, so that, for example, the speech of the city of Wuzhou some upstream in Guangxi is much more similar to that of Guangzhou than dialects of coastal districts that are closer but separated from the city by hilly terrain. One of these coastal languages, Taishanese, is the most common Yue variety among overseas communities. Yue varieties are not at all mutually intelligible with one another.\n\nIn Yuan Jiahua's dialect manual (1962), Yue dialects were divided into five groups:\n\nIn the \"Language Atlas of China\", some varieties spoken in western Guangxi formerly classified as Yue are placed in a separate Pinghua group.\nThe remaining Yue dialects are divided into seven groups.\nThree groups are found in the watershed of the Pearl River:\n\n\nThe remaining four groups are found in coastal areas:\n\n\nAnne Yue-Hashimoto has proposed an alternative classification based on a wider sampling of features:\n\nThe Dapeng dialect is a Cantonese-Hakka mixed language spoken by 3,000 to 5,500 people in Dapeng, Shenzhen.\n\nThe Guangzhou (Canton) dialect of \"Yuehai\", usually called \"Cantonese\", is the prestige dialect of Guangdong province and social standard of Yue. It is the most widely spoken dialect of Yue and is an official language of Hong Kong and of Macau, alongside English and Portuguese respectively. It is the \"lingua franca\" of not only Guangdong province but also of overseas Cantonese emigrants, though in many areas abroad it is numerically second to the Taishanese dialect of Yue.\n\nBy law, Mandarin (\"Putonghua\" or \"guoyu\") is the standard language of mainland China and Taiwan and is taught nearly universally as a supplement to local languages such as Cantonese in Guangdong and Guangxi. In Guangzhou, many distinctively Yue vocabulary items have been replaced with Cantonese pronunciations of corresponding \"Putonghua\" terms.\n\nCantonese is the \"de facto\" official language of Hong Kong (along with English) and Macau (along with Portuguese), though legally the official language is just \"Chinese\".\nIt is the oral language of instruction in Chinese schools in Hong Kong and Macau, and is used extensively in Cantonese-speaking households. Cantonese-language media (Hong Kong films, television serials, and Cantopop), isolation from the other regions of China, local identity, and the non-Mandarin speaking Cantonese diaspora in Hong Kong and abroad give the language a unique identity. Colloquial Hong Kong Cantonese often incorporates English words due to historical British influences.\n\nMost \"wuxia\" films from Canton are filmed originally in Cantonese and then dubbed or subtitled in Mandarin, English, or both.\n\nWhen the Chinese government removed the prohibition on emigration in the mid-19th century, many people from rural areas in the coastal regions of Fujian and Guangdong emigrated to Southeast Asia and North America. Until the late 20th century, the vast majority of Chinese immigrants to North America came from the Siyi (four counties) to the southwest of Guangzhou.\nThe speech of this region, particularly the Taishan dialect, is thus the most common Yue variety in these areas.\nIt is only partially understood by speakers of Cantonese.\n\nYue varieties are among the most conservative of Chinese varieties regarding the final consonants and tonal categories of Middle Chinese, so that the rhymes of Tang poetry are clearer in Yue dialects than elsewhere. However they have lost several distinctions in the initial and medial consonants that other Chinese varieties have retained.\n\nIn addition to aspirated and unaspirated voiceless initials, Middle Chinese had a series of voiced initials, but voicing has been lost in Yue and most other modern Chinese varieties apart from Wu and Old Xiang.\nIn the Guangfu, Siyi and Gao–Yang subgroups, these initials have yielded aspirated consonants in the level and rising tones, and unaspirated consonants in the departing and entering tones.\nThese initials are uniformly unaspirated in Gou–Lou varieties and uniformly aspirated in Wu–Hua.\n\nIn many Yue varieties, including Cantonese, Middle Chinese has become or in most words; in Taishanese, has also changed to , for example, in the native name of the dialect, \"Hoisan\".\nIn Siyi and eastern Gao–Yang, Middle Chinese has become a voiceless lateral fricative .\n\nMost Yue varieties have merged the Middle Chinese retroflex sibilants with the alveolar sibilants, in contrast with Mandarin dialects, which have generally maintained the distinction. For example, the words \"jiāng\" and \"zhāng\" are distinguished in Mandarin, but in modern Cantonese they have the same sound, \"jeung1\".\n\nMany Mandarin varieties, including Beijing dialect, have a third sibilant series, formed through a merger of palatalized alveolar sibilants and velars, but this is a recent innovation, which has not affected Yue and other Chinese varieties. For example, 晶, 精, 經 and 京 are all pronounced as \"jīng\" in Mandarin, but in Cantonese the first pair is pronounced \"jīng\", and the second pair \"gīng\". The earlier pronunciation is reflected in historical Mandarin romanizations, such as \"Peking\" (Beijing), \"Kiangsi\" (Jiangxi) and \"Tientsin\" (Tianjin).\n\nSome Yue speakers, such as many Hong Kong Cantonese speakers born after World War II, merge with , but Taishanese and most other Yue varieties preserve the distinction.\nYounger Cantonese speakers also tend not to distinguish between and the zero initial, though this distinction is retained in most Yue dialects.\nYue varieties retain the initial in words where Late Middle Chinese shows a shift to a labiodental consonant, realized in most Northern varieties of Chinese as .\nNasals can be independent syllables in Yue words, e.g. Cantonese \"ńgh\" (五) \"five\", and \"m̀h\" (唔) \"not\", although Middle Chinese did not have syllables of this type.\n\nIn most Yue varieties (except for Tengxian), the rounded medial has merged with the following vowel to form a monophthong, except after velar initials.\nIn most analyses velars followed by are treated as labio-velars.\n\nMost Yue varieties have retained the Middle Chinese palatal medial, but in Cantonese it has also been lost to monophthongization, yielding a variety of vowels.\n\nMiddle Chinese syllables could end with glides or , nasals , or , or stops , or . Syllables with vocalic or nasal endings could occur with one of three tonal contours, called level (\"píng\" 平), rising (\"shǎng\" 上) or departing (\"qù\" 去). Syllables with final stops were traditionally treated as a fourth tone category, the entering tone (\"rù\" 入), because the stops were distributed in the same way as the corresponding final nasals.\n\nWhile northern and central varieties have lost some of the Middle Chinese final consonants, they are retained by most southern Chinese varieties, though sometimes affected by sound shifts. They are most faithfully preserved in Yue dialects.\nFinal stops have disappeared entirely in most Mandarin dialects, including the Beijing-based standard, with the syllables distributed across the other tones.\nFor example, the characters , , , , , , , , , and are all pronounced \"yì\" in Mandarin, but they are all different in Yue (Cantonese \"jeoi6\", \"ngat6\", \"ngai6\", \"jik1\", \"jik6\", \"ji3\", \"ji6\", \"ai3\", \"jap1\", and \"jat6\", respectively).\n\nSimilarly, in Mandarin dialects the Middle Chinese final has merged with , but the distinction is maintained in southern varieties of Chinese such as Hakka, Min and Yue.\nFor example, Cantonese has \"taahm\" (譚) and \"tàahn\" (壇) versus Mandarin \"tán\", \"yìhm\" (鹽) and \"yìhn\" (言) versus Mandarin \"yán\", \"tìm\" (添) and \"tìn\" (天) versus Mandarin \"tiān\", and \"hàhm\" (含) and \"hòhn\" (寒) versus Mandarin \"hán\".\n\nMiddle Chinese is described in contemporary dictionaries as having four tones, where the fourth category, the entering tone, consists of syllables with final stops.\nMany modern Chinese varieties contain traces of a split of each of these four tones into two registers, an upper or \"yīn\" register from voiceless initials and a lower or \"yáng\" register from voiced initials.\nMandarin dialects retain the register distinction only in the level tone, yielding the first and second tones of the standard language (corresponding to the first and fourth tones in Cantonese), but have merged several of the other categories.\nMost Yue dialects have retained all eight categories, with a further split of the upper entering tone conditioned by vowel length, as also found in neighbouring Tai dialects.\nA few dialects spoken in Guangxi, such as the Bobai dialect, have also split the lower entering tone.\n\nWhile most Chinese varieties form compounds consisting of a qualifier followed by a qualified element, Yue dialects use the reverse order. For example, the Standard Chinese word for \"guest\" is 客人 \"kèrén\" \"guest-person\", but the same morphemes are interchanged in Cantonese \"jɐn ha:k\", Taishanese \"ŋin hak\" and Tengxian \"jən hɪk\". This is generally attributed to the influence of Tai languages, in which modifiers normally follow nouns.\nGender markers for nouns are also suffixed, as in other southern varieties.\n\nSome Yue dialects, including Cantonese, can use the same word \"bīn-go\" (), meaning \"which one\", for both \"who\" and \"which\".\nOther dialects, including Taishanese, use \"sŭe\" (, cognate with the word used in Mandarin) for \"who\", and words meaning \"which one\" for \"which\".\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n"}
