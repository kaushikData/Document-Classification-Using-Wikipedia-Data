While taking on such controversial subjects, Fatimah Rifaat’s protagonists remained religiously faithful with passive feelings towards their fate. Her stories did not attempt to undermine the patriarchal system; rather they were used to depict the problems inherent in a patriarchal society when men do not adhere to their religious teachings that advocate for the kind treatment of women. Fatimah Rifaat used the psydonymn Alifa to prevent embarrassment on the part of her family due to the themes of her stories and her writing career.\n\nFatma Abdullah Rifaat was born on June 5, 1930 in Cairo, Egypt. Her father was an architect and her mother was a housewife. Her family boasted that their roots are said to extend back to Umar ibn al-Khattab, a companion and advisor to the prophet Muhammad. She was raised in provincial Egypt and spent most of her life there. Subsequently, rural Egypt became the setting for most of her stories. Her active interest in writing began at age nine when she wrote a poem expressing the despair in her village. For this she was met with punishment by her family due to the poem’s subject matter. Fatimah attended Misr al-Jadidah Primary school and The Cultural Center for Women for her intermediate education. She also attended the British Institute in Cairo from 1946 to 1949 where she studied English. When Alifa Rifaat expressed interest in continuing her education by enrolling in the College of Fine Arts in Egypt her father instead arranged for her to marry her cousin, a police officer.\n\nFor the first few years of their marriage her husband allowed her to write and publish stories under her pseudonym despite the common idea of writing being a purely masculine field in Egyptian culture. She published her stories from 1955 until 1960 when she chose to stop after facing pressure from her husband to end her writing career. During this nearly 14-year period of literary silence Alifa Rifaat pursued the study of literature, astronomy, and history. Despite her attempts at preoccupation through these means Alifa Rifaat remained frustrated at her inability to express herself and the societal issues she faced as a woman through literary means.\n\nIn 1973, after facing a serious illness, Alifa’s husband allowed her once more to write and publish her work. She continued on to publish a collection of short stories and two novels beginning with the short story \"My World of the Unknown,\" for which she gained initial popularity.\n\nAlifa Rifaat’s husband died in 1979. Although she traveled across provincial Egypt in accordance to her husband’s transfers for work she never left Egypt until after his death. She continued on to make the [hajj], the sacred pilgrimage to Mecca, in 1981 and traveled to multiple European and Arab states including England, Turkey, Germany, Morocco, and Austria.\n\nThroughout her life Fatimah Rifaat became a member of the Federation of Egyptian Writers, the Short-Story Club, and the Dar al-Udaba (Egypt). She also attended the First International Women's Book Fair (London, England) in 1984 where she spoke about the rights of women in Islam and the topic of polygamy.\nIn 1984 Fatimah Rifaat received the Excellency Award from the Modern Literature Assembly.\n\nFatimah Rifaat Died at the age of 65 in January 1996. She left behind three sons and a body of over 100 works that have been translated into multiple languages and have been produced for television. Some of her works have also been read on BBC.\n\nAlifa Rifaat wrote in Arabic throughout her literary career. Her style, though focusing more on romance in the beginning of her career, later shifted to social critique after she met translator Denys John-Davies. Denys also persuaded her to write in a more colloquial style of Arabic, which although being a more accessible form of writing to the Egyptian population, was also during this period a less desired form of writing than the formal style. Her novels and short stories have been translated into multiple languages including English, German, Dutch, and Swedish. The most popular English translation of her work is of her collection of short stories, Distant View of a Minaret and Other Short Stories, which is translated by Denys Johnson-Davies.\n\nFatimah Rifaat, unlike the prominent Egyptian Feminist Nawal El Saadawi, focused her writing on women in traditional Islamic roles. In her autobiography Fatimah describes her father’s lack of affection towards her as a possible root of her exploration of the needs and desires of men in terms of women. She continues on to relate that through her life she found that \"all men seek is pleasure. For that reason I cry out for complete and complementary love in all my writings.\" Fatimah also expresses in her autobiography the need for men and women to only participate in intercourse when they are in a serene state, so that orgasm can be achieved, which she believes acts to strengthen faith in God.\n\nFatimah Rifaat’s writing centers upon the silent plight of women in a patriarchal Muslim society. Her stories mainly take place in provincial Egypt. These stories handle themes such as sex, death, marriage, masturbation, clitoridectomy, love, teenage pregnancy, widowhood, and loss along with other controversial topics. During this time period a woman was considered a purely sexual being, and the allowance of freedom of her sexuality was feared to result in fitna, or societal chaos. Although Alifa Rifaat strove to express through writing the sexual repression of women, her stories and her life were conducted in an orthodox Muslim manner and she did not advocate the rise of women against patriarchy. Most of Rifaat’s female protagonists take a resigned or begrudgingly accepting stance towards the hardships they face in life. For Fatimah Rifaat, patriarchy is merely a fact of life and acceptable under Quranic terms, however it is the opposite and in some instances even the same gender’s lack of observance towards religious teachings that acts as the catalyst to many of the protagonists’ problems. In her stories many of the sexual encounters take place during the characters' marriage and there is no instance of extra-marital male-female relationships as this would be considered purely sinful under the practice of Islam.\n\nSome of Fatimah Rifaat’s most popular stories include \"Distant View of a Minaret,\" \"Bahiyya’s Eyes,\" and \"My World of the Unknown.\"\n\n\"Distant View of a Minaret\" opens with a husband and wife performing the act of intercourse. The story is told from the wife’s point of view and it is quickly revealed that during this interaction she is both uninterested and feels estranged from her husband. She recalls how in the past she attempted to express her desire for sexual satisfaction to her husband which was met in return with denial and anger. At some point during the act she becomes aware of the call to prayer. Afterwards she performs necessary ablutions and her prayers, a ritual with which she feels more in touch with than with her own relationship with her husband. She then peers out the window to look at a minaret in Cairo, recounting how there used to be a view of multiple minarets before new buildings blocked them out. The husband then suffers from a heart attack while still in bed and dies. In the end the protagonist is dully surprised at how calm she has remained during and after her husband’s death.\nThis story conveys the passive female sexual role as pushed by selfish male domination of the sexual relationship in marriage. The lone minaret likely represents the solitude that the female protagonist experiences having resigned to this role.\n\n\"Bahiyya’s Eyes\" is told from the perspective of the aged Bahiyya speaking to her daughter after visiting a doctor about her loss of sight. She tells her daughter that although the doctor’s diagnosis attributes her loss of sight to natural causes and tells her she can be treated with medication she knows that it is instead due to all of the tears she has cried because of her life as a woman. Bahiyya then recounts her childhood, her clitoridectomy by the women of her village, her widowhood and the hardships of raising children as a single mother.\nThis story tackles the issue of suppression of female sexuality through recounting the events of Bahiyya’s childhood. She continues on to lament the position of women in society and the upholding of this low status by members of both genders. Bahiyya is also a name for Egypt.\n\n\"My World of the Unknown\" centers on a woman who enters into a sexual awakening with the aid of a jinni in the form of a snake. When the woman and her husband move into a house the wife discovers a female jinni in the form of a snake who teaches her the height of sexual pleasure. The woman remains with the snake despite her confusion until her husband kills a snake in the yard, violating the code of the jinni, at which point the female jinni leaves.\n\nThis story deals with the issue of feminine pleasure. Although the wife does have an affair with the jinni, since the creature is female it is not considered adultery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1609743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1609743", "title": "André Bjerke", "text": "André Bjerke\n\nJarl André Bjerke (30 January 1918-10 January 1985) was a Norwegian writer and poet. He wrote a wide range of material: poems (both for children and adults), mystery novels (four of them under the pseudonym Bernhard Borge), essays, and articles. He translated works by Shakespeare, Molière, Goethe and Racine. Bjerke was known as a prominent proponent of the Riksmål language during the Norwegian language struggle, and of anthroposophy, especially in the 1950s.\nBjerke was born at Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. His parents were the author Ejlert Bjerke and Karin (Svensson) Bjerke. He was the cousin of author Jens Bjørneboe (1920-1976). His debut was in 1940 with a collection of poems, \"Syngende Jord\". \n\nHis mystery novels were influenced by his interest in psychoanalysis. His first mystery novel, \"Nattmennesket\" was published in 1941. In this novel he introduced the psycho analyst Kai Bugge who claims that a psychologist is more able to solve a real crime than a police officer. After a particularly hideous murder, Bugge and police officer Hammer, join forces to solve the impossible mystery. Where Hammer looks for material clues and interviews the suspects about things like motive and alibis, Bugge makes an analytical approach.\n\"De dødes tjern\" from 1942 was made into a film in 1958, directed by Kåre Bergstrøm (1911–1976). This novel is also featured by Kai Bugge in opposition to literary critic, Gabriel Mørk and policeman, Harald Gran. The three accompanied by author Bernhard Borge, his wife and Gran's fiancee visit the scene of a suicide. The deceased had left a diary in which he revealed his growing obsession by the pond, which ends with a confession that he has no choice but to commit suicide by drowning himself. During the investigation it turns out that visitors are not immune to the forces that abode in the pond. \nIn 1947, he published \"Døde menn går i land\". This is the only one of his full novels that does not star Kai Bugge, but the conflict between a traditional solver of mysteries and those who dabbles in paranormal phenomena is a central motif in the novel. Arne Krag-Andersen has bought a famously haunted house on the southern coast of Norway. There is a curse on the manor: Any one who tries to change anything whatsoever with the house or its contents, will die a violent death. American minister Pahle is deeply fascinated by satanism and claims that a satanic cult was connected to the house. A deserted Estonian ship found outside the shore adds to the atmosphere. \nIn 1950, \"Skjult Mønster\" was published. Kai Bugge re-enters the scene, but even if he solves the strange mystery and sheds light on the hidden pattern, he plays no central role. Irene Cramer is scared to death, and it seems clearly that her fright is not only imagined. She moves in with four bachelors in an attempt to be protected, but even their chivalrous behavior doesn't give her the security she craves. The reader is led through a veritable maze with a pattern that seems impossible until the hidden pattern is revealed by Kai Bugge.\n\nThe short story collection \"Tryllestaven\" from 1961 does not really fit the description \"mysteries\". A few of them are, but most of them concerns other parts of life. You meet a young boy and his dreams, a girl solving the ultimate question for a scientist, a very distorted traditional Norwegian fairy tale, an underdog who finds his magic wand in shape of a walking cane, the challenge of writing soberly while sober and other stories. \n\nIn 1963 André Bjerke published \"Enhjørningen\" under his own name. \"Enhjørningen\" consists of three novellas and a short story bound together by the challenge between psychology and the unicorn – representing the supernatural forces in existence. Dr. Kahrs denies the existence of any unicorn, and his three bridge-playing friends, author Nordberg, ad-man Bøhmer and journalist Strand, try to convince him by telling of their meeting with the unicorn. \n\nBjerke also published the short story collection, \"Hobby-detektiven\" where the very unusual police officer, Klaus Vangli is the hero. Vangli has a very untraditional approach to the different mysteries he sets out to solve. He claims that his enormous range of hobbies gives him the necessary skills and knowledge to solve murders, thefts, fraud and a rather petty theft by a small child. His hobbies covers chess, astronomy, optics, philately, track and field, football betting and other interests that has seems to have nothing in common. \n\nBjerke also published two collections of mystery short stories in 1970, titled \"Onkel Oscar starter opp\" and \"Onkel Oscar kjører videre\". Oscar is a cab driver in contemporary Oslo who is mixed up in different crimes and solves them by his ability his acumen. The stories, co-written by TV host, Harald Tusberg, were adaptations from the manuscripts for the TV series about uncle Oscar. \n\nBjerke was the co-host of the television show NRK Streiftog i grenseland in 1973. This series of shows was the first dedicated to investigating paranormal and occult phenomena. Harald Tusberg was the other host.\n\nAndré Bjerke was a chess player and wrote several essays about the history and culture of chess. \n\nBjerke was married to the actress Henny Moan. Together they had a daughter, Vilde, who wrote a book about her father, \"Du visste om et land\" in 2002.\nAfter a debilitating stroke in 1981, he was bound to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. In 1983, he was made a knight in the Order of St. Olav. He died during 1985 and was buried at Vestre gravlund in Olso.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

One of the most authoritative was the Bible that Jekuthiel Blitz translated in 1678.\n\nThere are numerous Biblical translations in Yiddish because it constituted the very beginning of its literature along with other the religious texts such as the Talmud. Scholars explained that this can be attributed to the fact that the Bible is a popular book among the Jewish communities in Germany and surrounding European countries and it was also a reference for the early education of young Jews there.\n\nThere were different translation style such as the so-called Ashkenazi literary tradition, more popularly known as \"taytsh-khumesh\", which translated the Bible literally. Here, the words in the Hebrew original were translated into their Yiddish counterparts. While this method was widely criticized, mainly for its strict adherence to the literal meaning of the text, it proved useful particularly for theologians and Hebraists who needed sources in their effort to understand of the literal sense of the Bible.\n\nJekuthiel Blitz, who was a rabbi from Wittmund, Germany, published his work with the backing financial backers such as Aharon Halevi, who obtained \"haskomes\" for the undertaking from the Council of the Four Lands, the central governing body of Polish Jews. \n\nA notable milestone in the historical development of the Yiddish Bible involved Solomon Bloomgarden's initiative. His translation is considered to be the most comprehensive and was published under his pen name Yehosesh. The text is regarded as both literary and scholarly, influenced the work of Yiddish scholars in the nineteenth century. \n\n\n"}

His work as a poet and historian is marked by nationalist claims and calls to rebellion against the French state on the model of Irish nationalism.\n\nHe was the grandson of a Chouan officer. He was based in Paris when in 1909 he published his first collections of poetry. The same year, in the \"Revue de l’Ouest\", he wrote \"Traditionalism and separatism\", an article advocating separatist politics in defence of cultural tradition. His proposals caused a sensation. He was the principal founder of the Breton Nationalist Party in 1911, and was arrested when the party launched a protest in the same year at the official opening of a monument to the unity of Brittany and France. Le Mercier d'Erm also founded the activist journal \"Breiz Dishual\" (Free Brittany).\n\nThe party and journal folded in 1914 on the outbreak of World War I. Immediately after the war, Le Mercier d'Erm helped to found a replacement journal, Breiz Atao (Brittany Forever), which was created in 1919.

{"id": "1860204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1860204", "title": "Centre-right politics", "text": "Centre-right politics\n\nCentre-right politics or center-right politics (American English), also referred to as moderate-right politics, are politics that lean to the right of the left–right political spectrum, but are closer to the centre than other right-wing politics. From the 1780s to the 1880s, there was a shift in the Western world of social class structure and the economy, moving away from the nobility and mercantilism, as well as moving towards the bourgeoisie and capitalism. This general economic shift towards capitalism affected centre-right movements such as the British Conservative Party, that responded by becoming supportive of capitalism.\n\nThe International Democrat Union, an alliance of centre-right political parties, including the British Conservative Party, the Republican Party of the United States, the Conservative Party of Canada, the Liberal Party of Australia, the New Zealand National Party and Christian democratic parties, amongst others across the world. It is committed to the principles that \"democratic societies provide individuals throughout the world with the best conditions for political liberty, personal freedom, equality of opportunity, and economic development under the rule of law; and therefore being committed to advancing the social and political values on which democratic societies are founded, including the basic personal freedoms and human rights, as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; in particular, the right of free speech, organization, assembly, and non-violent dissent; the right to free elections and the freedom to organise effective parliamentary opposition to government; the right to a free and independent media; the right to religious belief; equality before the law; and individual opportunity and prosperity\".\n\nThe prominent inspiration for the centre-right (especially in Britain) was the traditionalist conservatism of Edmund Burke. Burke's traditionalist conservatism was more moderate than the continental conservatism developed by Joseph De Maistre in France, that upon experiencing the French Revolution completely denounced the status quo that existed immediately prior to the revolution (unlike Burke) and de Maistre sought a reactionary counter-revolution that would dismantle all modern society and return it to a strictly religious-based society. While Burke condemned the French Revolution, he had supported the American Revolution that he viewed as being a conservative revolution. Burke claimed that the Americans revolted for the same reason as the English had during the Glorious Revolution, in both cases a monarch had overstepped the boundaries of his duties. Burke claimed that the American Revolution was justified because King George III had overstepped his customary rights by imposing taxes on the American colonists without their consent. Burke opposed the French Revolution because he opposed its anti-traditionalism and its use of abstract ideas, such as the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and its universal egalitarianism that Burke rebuked by claiming that it effectively endorsed \"hairdressers\" being able to be politicians.\n\nIn Britain, the traditionalist conservative movement was represented in the British Conservative Party. Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Benjamin Disraeli sought to address social problems affecting the working class due to lack of assistance from the laissez-faire economy and formed his one nation conservatism that claimed that lack of assistance for the lower classes had divided British society into two nations – the rich and the poor as the result of unrestrained private enterprise, he claimed that he sought to break down. Disraeli said that he supported a united British nation while presenting the other parties representing the upper-class or the lower-class. Disraeli was hostile to free trade and preferred aristocratic paternalism as well as promoting imperialism. However, with the revival in Britain of the socialist movement with the rise of the Labour Party and the demise of the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party shifted to become a supporter of capitalism and an opponent of socialism, while advocacy of capitalism was promoted within the principles of traditionalist conservatism.\n\nAnother centre-right movement that arose in France in response to the French Revolution was the beginning of the Christian democracy movement, where moderate conservative Catholics accepted the democratic elements of the French Revolution. The first Christian democratic party was founded in Italy in 1919 by Luigi Sturzo, but it was suppressed by the Italian Fascist regime and was forced into exile in France. In France, Sturzo founded an international movement that supported the creation of a European common market and European integration to prevent war, amongst those who attended the group included future German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, Alcide de Gasperi and Robert Schuman.\n\nIn Europe after World War II, centre-right Christian democratic parties arose as powerful political movements while the authoritarian reactionary Catholic traditionalist movements in Europe diminished in strength. Christian democratic movements became major movements in Austria, the Benelux countries, Germany and Italy.\n\nNeoliberalism arose as an economic theory by Milton Friedman that condemned government interventionism in the economy that it associated with socialism and collectivism. Neoliberals rejected Keynesian economics that they claimed advocate too much emphasis on relieving unemployment in response to their observance of the Great Depression, identifying the real problem as being with inflation and advocate the policy of monetarism to deal with inflation.\n\nNeoliberal economics was endorsed by Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who adapted it as part of a free-market conservatism closer to the developments in American conservatism, while traditionalist conservatism became less influential within the British Conservative Party. However, the British Conservative Party still has a large traditional conservative base, particularly the conservative Cornerstone Group. Thatcher publicly supported centre-right politics and supported its spread in Eastern Europe after the end of the Marxist-Leninist regimes in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, a variety of centre-right political parties have emerged there, including many that support neoliberalism.\n\nIn the United States, President Ronald Reagan (1981–1989) adopted many policies stemming from Milton Friedman's economic theories, including principles from the Chicago school of economics and monetarism. While social conservatives and the rise of the Christian Right contributed greatly to forming the Reagan Coalition, the President also had the support of right-wing economic neoliberals. Using Friedman's neoliberal theories, the Reagan administration cut the marginal income tax from 70% to 28%, reduced inflation from 13.5% in Jimmy Carter's final year (1980) to 1.9% in 1986 and reduced civilian unemployment from 10.8% to 5.3% of the workforce.\n"}

Some newspapers include other personnel as well. Editorial boards for magazines may include experts in the subject area that the magazine focuses on, and larger magazines may have several editorial boards grouped by subject. An executive editorial board may oversee these subject boards, and usually includes the executive editor and representatives from the subject focus boards.\n\nEditorial boards meet on a regular basis to discuss the latest news and opinion trends and discuss what the newspaper should say on a range of issues. They will then decide who will write what editorials and for what day. When such an editorial appears in a newspaper, it is considered the institutional opinion of that newspaper. At some newspapers, the editorial board will also review wire service and syndicated columns for inclusion on the editorial page or op-ed page. Some newspapers, particularly small ones, do not have an editorial board, choosing instead to rely on the judgment of a single editorial page editor.\n\nBook and magazine publishers will often use their editorial boards to review or select manuscripts or articles, and sometimes to check facts. Book publishers may also make use of editorial boards, using subject experts to select manuscripts.\n\nThe editorial board meeting ran by Phyllis E. Grann at Putnam was called the \"Thursday Morning Breakfast Meeting.\" The meeting was described in \"New York Magazine\" as, \"8:30 event had a war-room atmosphere, with representatives of every department--editorial, publicity, sales and marketing--reporting in to Grann, who made decisions like a Mike Milken-style bond trader, constantly evaluation and re-evaluating her positions.\" \n\nAlmost all academic journals have an editorial board consisting of selected, unpaid experts in the academic field covered by a journal. This is almost always an honorary position, although board members sometimes provide peer review of submissions. A member may be asked to review several manuscripts per year and may edit a special issue. The members may also be consulted regarding new regulations at the journal. They are expected to promote the journal among their peers.\n\nThe editorial board controls the endorsement process for the newspaper during campaigns. Candidates will come before the editorial board for a group interview which can last for several hours, depending on the office. During the meeting, the board asks the candidate a range of questions on various issues and uses the meeting as a way to judge which candidate to endorse.\n\nCandidates may routinely meet with editorial board early in their campaigns in order to provide their opinions to the newspaper's decision makers. This is a way to steer media coverage their way and to influence the final endorsement.\n5\n\n"}

He was the Consul General of the Ottoman Empire in Bordeaux, Brussels, Paris and Buenos Aires. He authored books and articles in Arabic, Spanish and French.\n\nHe initially supported the ideas of the Young Turks, who favoured a reform so as to restore the Ottoman constitution of 1876 and the parliament and grant rights to all the individuals and nations of the Empire. In 1914, while at office as Ottoman Consul General in Buenos Aires, he broke with the Young Turks government due to its alliance with the German Empire and its entrance in World War I, which Arslan harshly criticized.\n\nHe denounced the extermination of Armenians from the review he founded and edited, La Nota, in August 1915. During his stay in Europe he had also condemned the Hamidian massacres from the French press.\n\nAfter the war Arslan initially supported a provisional Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. As the Mandate prolonged he denounced it as a corrupt and despotic colonization and adhered to the idea of the independence of former Ottoman Syria as a single sovereign state.\n\nEmin Arslan was born in Choueifat, Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, Ottoman Empire. He belonged to a distinguished Druze family whose members hold traditionally the title of Emirs until today.\n\nEmin was son of Zahiyya Shihāb and Mağīd Arslān, son of Milḥam, son of Ḥaidar, son of 'Abbās, son of Fakhreddīn. He had three brothers: Nouhad, Fouad, Sa'īd and Tawfīq (also transliterated as Toufic). The latter helped found Greater Lebanon in 1920 and fathered Mağīd Arslān II (1908–1983), a Lebanon's independence hero, member of the Lebanese Parliament and government minister. Current traditional chief of the Arslān family, Talal Arslan, is therefore a great niece of Emin Arslan.\n\nEmin did not marry and had no children; he was succeeded by his nieces Rafīq Sa'īd Arslān, Malik Sa'īd Arslān, Zahiyya Tawfīq Arslān, Majīd Tawfīq Arslān (i.e. Mağīd Arslān II) and Nuhād Tawfīq Arslān.\n\nIn 1892 he was designated \"mudīr\" ('director') of the Far West Directorate (\"Nāḥyat al-Ġarb al-Aqṣā\"), in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. He resigned in 1893 after a conflict with the \"mutaṣarrif\" Na'ūm Pāšā (Naum Pasha). Arslan joined the Freemasonry on 24 August 1889.\n\nIn 1893, he resigned as \"mudīr\" and joined his friend Salim Sarkis in exile. They stopped briefly in Egypt and then went to Paris where, along with other Arab expatriates founded the \"Turkish Syrian Committee.\"\n\nThey contacted Ahmed Rıza, a major supporter of the Young Turks movement and editor of \"Meşveret\", a Turkish written political newspaper. The main activity of the exiles was to spread criticism against the Ottoman regime through the general European press and from some party organs. They demanded restoration of the 1876 Ottoman constitution, reestablishment of the parliament and equal rights for individuals and communities.\n\n\"Kashf an-Niqāb\" (كشف النقاب), i.e. \"unveiling\", was an Arabic written newspaper edited in Paris by Emin Arslan and his friend, writer and journalist Salim Sarkis, from 9 August 1894 until 25 July 1895.\n\nAccording to Sarkis, the Ottoman embassy pressured the French authorities into censoring the magazine and order the concierge to disclose names of visitors.\n\n\"Turkiyā al-Fatāt\" (تركيا الفتاة) – \"La Jeune Turquie\", i.e. \"Young Turkey\", was a bilingual biweekly edited in Paris in Arabic and French from December 1895 through middle 1897 by Emin Arslan and Ḫalīl Ġānim (خليل غانم) on behalf of the \"Turkish Syrian Committee,\" self described as \"journal of political propaganda.\" It criticized sultan Abdul Hamid II's government.\n\nCo-editor Khalil Ghanem (Beirut 1847 – Paris 1903) had taken part in the previous reformist movement known as the Young Ottomans. Member of the first Ottoman parliament in 1877, the French Embassy in Istanbul granted him political asylum after his mentor Midhat Pasha was deposed. Before meeting Arslan he had founded and edited al-Bassir (al-Bașīr البصير) weekly (Paris, 1881–1882). Ghanem wrote also for the Journal des débats and was named chevalier of the French Legion of Honour in 1879.\n\nOn 1896 Arslan wrote four articles that were published on La Revue Blanche, titled \"Les Affaires de Crète\", \"Les Affaires d'Orient\", \"Les Troubles de Syrie\" and \"Les Arménians à Constantinople\". The latter was about the Occupation of the Ottoman Bank by Armenian militants and denounced the subsequent brutal retaliation. At those times Arslan frequented French writer Jules Claretie and they assisted together at the fourth International Press Congress in Stockholm in 1897.\n\nThe Ottoman leadership tried to neutralize the exiles' propaganda in Europe. Despite not being too numerous, the exiles managed to get attention in the press. As one of them wrote: \"(...) <nowiki>[the sultan]</nowiki> \"knows that if we are allowed a free hand in Paris our members and papers can do him more harm than ten French men-of-war\".\"\n\nOn 29 January 1897, one of their communiques was published by the Official Bulletin of the Kingdom of Italy. It was addressed to \"the six powers signatories of the Treatises of Paris and Berlin\" and it was signed by \"Murād Bey, general deputy of the Young Turkey; Ḫalīl Ġānim, former representative of Syria before the Turkish parliament; Ahmed Rıza Bey; the Emir Emin Arslan; H. Anthony Salmoné\", et al., on behalf of the \"party of the general reformation in Turkey.\"\n\nThe Ottoman government sent to Paris Ahmed Cemâluddîn with the mission of contacting the opposition and offer a general pardon for political prisoners, restoring the exiles in their former positions and reestablishing the constitution, in exchange for ending their propaganda campaign.\n\nArslan states in his memories that initially he rejected the agreement despite having direct relatives who would be released with the amnesty. Then he proposed suspending the agreement until Istanbul showed progress in abiding by it, which was rejected by Cemâluddîn. He finally agreed and was designated Consul General in Bordeaux.\n\nThe sultan fulfilled his promises except for restoring the constitution and reopening the parliament, which would only happen in 1908 with the Young Turks Revolution.\n\nSince the 1897 \"truce\" Emin Arslan was designated Consul General of the Ottoman Empire in Bordeaux and almost immediately transferred to Brussels, where he stayed at office until 1908.\n\nIn Belgium Arslan befriended Roland de Marès (1874–1955), director of \"L'indépendance belge\" newspaper, and jurist Ernest Nys.\n\nDespite joining the Ottoman consular service Arslan kept publishing articles, sometime with heavy criticism against the government. As a 1900 article in The Nation quoted:\n\n\"A new advocate for reform in Turkey has risen in Emin Arslan Effendi, the Consul General in Brussels. Last year he sent to Abdul Hamid a detailed report of the sufferings of the peasants in certain of the richest provinces in the empire. He pointed out that, unable to bear the heavy burden of taxation and the arbitrary methods of the farmers of revenue, they were cutting down their trees, tearing up their vines, leaving their lands uncultivated, and even emigrating in vast numbers beyond the seas. America alone, be said, contained more than 100,000 Syrian emigrants, a third of whom were Mohammedans. \"Never in the history of Islam has such a thing occurred.\" In this year’s report he dwells upon the great numbers of high officials and their enormous salaries. There are in the army, for instance, forty-four marshals, and forty-six viziers with the rank of marshal, and there are eighty members of the Council of State\"—\"as many as in France and Germany put together. Mukhtar Pasha's salary is four times as large as Lord Cromer's, and the Grand Vizier receives twice as much as Lord Salisbury. But \"as the majority of these high officials receive from the Treasury double and sometimes treble their salaries, the financial embarrassment of the empire is but natural\".\"\n\nA novel that Arslan wrote in Spanish years after, \"End of a romance\" (\"Final de un idilio\") is staged in Brussels short before WWI. Its main characters are Van Doren, an army officer and aristocrat, and Riette, a French Alsacian girl. It was first edited in Buenos Aires in 1917.\n\nArslan resigned as Ottoman Consul General in Brussels on 1908 and travelled to Istanbul. A month before, the Young Turks Revolution had taken over the power although without deposing Sultan Abdul Hamid II.\n\nDuring the Ottoman countercoup of 1909, a first cousin of Arslan's, Latakia's representative to the Congress Muḥammad Muṣṭafā Arslān, was shot and killed close to the Parliament. Emin Arslan had to take care of his remnants and arrange their transport to Beyrouth. The French newspaper Gil Blas published on 15 April 1909, that \"the Emir Arslan, representative for Latakia\" had been killed. Some European friends of Emin Arslan thought he was the victim.\n\nEmin Arslan was designated Consul General in Paris in 1909. Paris' Le Temps informed in September 1909, that \"the Turkish government resolved to upgrade its Paris consulate to a general consulate\" and that Emir Emin Arslan, former Consul General in Brussels, had been designated as Consul General in Paris.\n\nIn his biographic writings Arslan states that he looked for an alternative destination, without elaborating on the reasons. By then, ambassador to France was Na'ūm Pāšā, former \"mutaṣarrif\" of Mount Lebanon during Arslan's tenure as \"mudīr\" in 1893. Apparently Arslan did not have good relations with Na'ūm; 17 years before, a conflict with him had caused his resignation as mudīr and his exile.\n\nOnce Arslan found out about the newly established consular relations between the Ottoman Empire and the Argentine Republic, he asked to be transferred to Buenos Aires.\n\nOn 11 June 1910, the Ottoman Empire and the Argentine Republic signed an agreement on consular relations and exchanged consuls before the treatise was approved by both the parliaments (the Argentine congress sanctioned law 8184 approving the treatise only on 2 September 1911).\n\nEmir Emin Arslan was to be the first and only consul of the Ottoman Empire in Argentina, because in 1914 the Porte removed Arslan and the German Consulate assumed the representation of Ottoman interests in Argentina. Arslan arrived in Buenos Aires on 29 October 1910, on board of the steamboat \"Chili\", belonging to French firm Messageries Maritimes, \"to an exuberant welcome by a crowd of 4000 Ottoman subjects.\"\n\nBefore arriving in Buenos Aires, the 'Chili' made a stop at Rio de Janeiro, where Argentine newspapers of the last weeks were available. Other passengers informed Arslan that during a debate in the Argentine Senate, Senator Manuel Láinez had critiziced the Syro-Ottoman immigration deeming it \"not useful\" because it was purportedly composed of peddlers rather than agricultural workers.\n\nOttoman immigration had been defended by La Rioja Senator Joaquín V. González. The Senate session was on 12 September 1910, few days before Arslan's arrival to Buenos Aires, on 29 October 1910. Since Arslan was aware of that kind of criticism, right from his first press interviews he announced that he was going to favor the dedication of his fellows to agriculture. Short after his arrival he visited Senator González to thank him for his defense of the Syro-Ottoman community. Since they were both fluent in French they could communicate without a translator. They became close friends until González's demise in December 1923.\n\nAlthough Arslan had arrived in Argentina without any knowledge of Spanish, short after his arrival he published his first articles in Spanish at Caras y Caretas magazine and started writing a novel: \"End of a romance\" (\"Final de un idilio\"). In the long \"dedication to general Roca\" that opens the novel, Arslan states that he wrote part of the book in \"La Larga\" Roca's ranch, (\"Estancia La Larga\"). The former president died in 1914 before a scheduled second visit of Arslan's to \"La Larga\". The novel's first edition was published in 1917.\n\nWhile at office as Consul General in Buenos Aires, Arslan wrote for the \"Revista Argentina de Ciencias Políticas\" (\"Argentine Review of Political Science\"), directed by Rodolfo Rivarola, the following articles: \"\"La joven Turquía y Europa\" (\"Young Turkey and Europe\", t. II, pp. 200–215, 1911), \"La Tripolitania\" (\"The Tripolitania\", t. III, pp. 177–87, 379–90, 1911) and \"Historia diplomática de la Europa Balcánica\"\" (\"Diplomatic History of Balcanic Europe\", t. VI, pp. 635–66, 1913).\n\nArslan opposed the entry of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and his relation with the Ottoman Foreign Ministry was damaged. He resigned in late 1914. The Ottoman Empire then entrusted its consular relations with Argentina to the German Consul General in Buenos Aires, Rodolfo Bobrik, who demanded Arslan to surrender the consulate and its documentation. Arslan replied that he had not received an official communication from Istanbul ordering him to hand down consular documentation to a foreign official. The German Consul General filed a case before Argentine's Supreme Court. The Court upheld the claim.\n\nIn an article published on June 1916 on \"La Nota\" magazine, Arslan wrote about the death sentence \"in absentia\" passed against him after he was declared \"\"firārī\", i.e. \"fugitive\". The review's staff organized a banquet in his honor at a restaurant called \"Ferrari\" after his owner's surname, and published the news under the title \"A death sentence celebrated with a banquet\".\" \n\nArslan founded and directed weekly \"La Nota\", whose first issue was published on 14 August 1915. During 1916 Carlos Alberto Leumann was its editor-in-chief. A total of 312 issues were edited until discontinuation in 1921.\n\n\"La Nota\" was one of the main Argentine literary magazines of its time and among its contributors were Emilio Becher, Arturo Cancela, Juan Pablo Echagüe, Martín Gil, José Ingenieros, Leopoldo Lugones, Ricardo Rojas, José Enrique Rodó, Eduardo Talero, Manuel Ugarte, Joaquín de Vedia, Joaquín V. González, Alfredo L. Palacios, Franciso Grandmontagne, Víctor Pérez Petit, Charles de Soussens, Arturo Marasso, Carlos Ibarguren, Baldomero Fernández Moreno, Carlos Alberto Leumann, Ataliva Herrera, Julio V. González, Enrique Banchs, Arturo Capdevila, Alfonsina Storni, Evar Méndez, Mario Bravo, Alfredo R. Bufano, Alberto Mendióroz, José Gabriel, Pablo Rojas Paz, Alberto Gerchunoff, Juan Carlos Dávalos, Ricardo Güiraldes, Roberto Mariani, Antonio Herrero, Ricardo E. Molinari, Enrique Méndez Calzada, Héctor Lafleur, Sergio Provenzano, Fernando Alonso, Carlos López Buchardo, Ricardo Rojas, Francisco Sicardi, Joaquín de Vedia, Francisco A. Barroetaveña, Juan Zorrilla de San Martín, Amado Nervo and Rubén Darío.\n\n\"La Nota\" had a strongly anti-German posture during World War I. For instance, poem \"Apóstrofe\", by Almafuerte, a diatribe against German emperor William II, appeared twice: 15 January and 5 February 1916.\n\nAlfonsina Storni published some of her first works on \"La Nota\" during 1916. She was a permanent contributor from 28 March until 21 November 1919. Her poems “Convalecer” and “Golondrinas” were published in the magazine.\n\nMiguel de Unamuno wrote in a letter to Pedro Jiménez Ilundain on 20 February 1916: \"\"I read quite a lot and write a bit, almost always about the war, especially for Argentina, for La Nación and La Nota (do you know this weekly?)\".\" He considered \"La Nota\" \"\"quite an interesting and frankly germanophobe magazine\".\"\n\nDuring 1916 Pablo Rojas Paz headed the literary criticism section of the magazine.\n\nIn 1921, during the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, Arslan acquired the Argentine citizenship and made public his reasons: \n\nIn 1925 Arslan founded the \"humoristic, political and literary weekly \"El Lápiz Azul\" (i.e. \"The Blue Pencil\"). Editor-in-chief was Celso Tíndaro (born Pedro B. Franco, 1894–1947). 47 issues were published from May 1925 to May 1926, including texts from Leopoldo Lugones, Alberto Williams, Eugenio d'Ors and Eduardo Acevedo Díaz.\n\nIn June 1926, Arslan founded \"Al-Istiklal\" (الإستقلال), \"The Independence.\" The magazine was in Arabic but part of its commercial ads were in Spanish. It came into being \"as a political and intellectual response to the upheaval caused by the Great Syrian Revolt\", and \"was one of the main Arabic anti-French organs from Argentina/Brazil. Moreover, it represented a particular strand within local pan-Arab/nationalist anti-colonial thought and activism\".\n\nArslan kept editing this newspaper until his demise in January 1943.\n\nIn 1926 Arslan founded the Druze Benefit Society, currently known as Druze Benefit Association (Asociación de Beneficencia Drusa) and located in Buenos Aires.\n\n\nMost editions of Arslan's books include a list of unpublished theatrical works that are today lost: \n\n"}
{"id": "2318626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2318626", "title": "German studies", "text": "German studies\n\nGerman studies is the field of humanities that researches, documents, and disseminates German language and literature in both its historic and present forms. Academic departments of German studies often include classes on German culture, German history, and German politics in addition to the language and literature component. Common German names for the field are , , and . In English the terms Germanistics or Germanics are sometimes used (mostly by Germans), but the subject is more often referred to as \"German studies\", \"German language and literature\", or \"German philology\".\n\nModern German studies is usually seen as a combination of two sub-disciplines: German linguistics and Germanophone literature studies.\n\nGerman linguistics is traditionally called philology in Germany, as there is something of a difference between philologists and linguists. It is roughly divided as follows:\n\nIn addition, the discipline examines German under various aspects: the way it is spoken and written, i.e., spelling; declination; vocabulary; sentence structure; texts; etc. It compares the various manifestations such as social groupings (slang, written texts, etc.) and geographical groupings (dialects, etc.).\n\nThe study German literature is divided into two parts: \"Ältere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft\" deals with the period from the beginnings of German in the early Middle Ages up to post-Medieval times around AD 1750, while the modern era is covered by \"Neuere Deutsche Literaturwissenschaft\". The field systematically examines German literature in terms of genre, form, content, and motifs as well as looking at it historically by author and epoch. Important areas include edition philology, history of literature, and textual interpretation. The relationships of German literature to the literatures of other languages (e.g. reception and mutual influences) and historical contexts are also important areas of concentration. \"The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory: Fourth Edition\" () is printed in English but contains many German-language literary terms that apply cross-culturally in the field of literary criticism; quite a few of the in terms in the book originated in German but have since been adopted by English-language critics and scholars.\n\nAt least in Germany and Austria, German studies in academia play a central role in the education of German school teachers. Their courses usually cover four fields:\nSeveral universities offer specialized curriculae for school teachers, usually called \"'\". In Germany, they are leading to a two step exam and certificate by the federal states of Germany cultural authorities, called the ' (\"state exam\").\n\nIn recent years, German has looked for links with the fields of communications, cultural studies and media studies. In addition, the sub-branch of film studies has established itself.\n\nAs an unsystematic field of interest for individual scholars, German studies can be traced back to Tacitus' \"Germania\". The publication and study of legal and historical source material, such as Medieval Bible translations, were all undertaken during the German Renaissance of the sixteenth century, truly initiating the field of German studies. As an independent university subject, German studies was introduced at the beginning of the nineteenth century by Georg Friedrich Benecke, the Brothers Grimm, and Karl Lachmann.\n\n\n\n\"German studies\" is taught at many German universities. Some examples are:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Paul Getty Trust included in the Getty Vocabulary Program. The TGN includes names and associated information about places. Places in TGN include administrative political entities (e.g., cities, nations) and physical features (e.g., mountains, rivers). Current and historical places are included. Other information related to history, population, culture, art and architecture is included. \n\nThe resource is available to museums, art libraries, archives, visual resource collection catalogers, bibliographic projects through private license or available to members of the general public for free on the Getty Vocabulary website (see external links).\n\nThe Getty vocabulary databases (Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), Union List of Artist Names (ULAN), and TGN) are produced and maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program. They are compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction. They contain terms, names, and other information about people, places, things, and concepts relating to art, architecture, and material culture.\n\nThe Getty vocabularies can be used in three ways: at the data entry stage, by catalogers or indexers who are describing works of art, architecture, material culture, archival materials, visual surrogates, or bibliographic materials; as knowledge bases, providing information for researchers; and as search assistants to enhance end-user access to online resources.\n\nWork on the TGN began in 1987, when the Getty created a department dedicated to compiling and distributing terminology, at that time called the Vocabulary Coordination Group. The AAT was already being managed by the Getty at that time, and the Getty attempted to respond to requests from the creators of art information for additional controlled vocabularies for artists' names (ULAN) and geographic names (TGN). The development of TGN was informed by an international study completed by the Thesaurus Artis Universalis (TAU), a working group of the Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art (CIHA), and by the consensus reached at a colloquium held in 1991, attended by the spectrum of potential users of geographic vocabulary in cataloging and scholarship of art and architectural history and archaeology. The initial core of the TGN was compiled from thousands of geographic names in use by various Getty cataloging and indexing projects, enlarged by information from U. S. government databases, and further enhanced by the manual entry of information from published hard-copy sources. The TGN grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the Getty Vocabulary Program.\n\nThe basic principles under which the TGN is constructed and maintained were established by the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) and also employed for the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN): Its scope includes terminology needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is constructed using national and international standards for thesaurus construction; it comprises a hierarchy with tree structures corresponding to the current and historical worlds; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community.\n\nTGN was founded under the management of Eleanor Fink (head of what was then called the Vocabulary Coordination Group, and subsequently Director of the Art History Information Program, later called the Getty Information Institute). TGN has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors, under the supervision of several managers. Technical support for the TGN was provided by the Getty. TGN was first published in 1997 in machine-readable files. Given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the TGN, hard-copy publication was deemed to be impractical. It is currently published in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The data for the TGN is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, building complex and changing polyhierarchies, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of the TGN is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. The current managers of the TGN are Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor, and Murtha Baca, Head, Vocabulary Program and Digital Resource Management.\n\nTGN is available as Linked Open Data since August 2014.\n\nTGN is a structured vocabulary currently containing around 1,106,000 names and other information about places. Names for a place may include names in the vernacular language, English, other languages, historical names, names and in natural order and inverted order. Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name.\n\nTGN is a thesaurus, compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships. Note that TGN is not a GIS (Geographic Information System). While many records in TGN include coordinates, these coordinates are approximate and are intended for reference only.\n\nThe focus of each TGN record is a place. There are around 912,000 places in the TGN. In the database, each place record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to the record for the place are names, the place's parent or position in the hierarchy, other relationships, geographic coordinates, notes, sources for the data, and place types, which are terms describing the role of the place (e.g., inhabited place and state capital). The temporal coverage of the TGN ranges from prehistory to the present and the scope is global.\n\nThe TGN is a faceted classification system as well as a poly-hierarchical one. There are two facets: World and Extraterrestrial. Within the World facet are Physical Features and Political Entities. One can view administrative places from as broad as continents and regions to as specific as neighborhoods, boroughs, towns, and cities. Within the Physical Features facets are mountain ranges, oceans, seas, rivers, waterfalls, island groups, and deserts.\n\nThe record for each concept includes its place in the hierarchy (with a link to its parent), as well as links to related terms, related concepts, sources for the data, and notes.\n\n\n"}

More specifically, the conjecture states that certain de Rham cohomology classes are algebraic, that is, they are sums of Poincaré duals of the homology classes of subvarieties. It was formulated by the Scottish mathematician William Vallance Douglas Hodge as a result of a work in between 1930 and 1940 to enrich the description of de Rham cohomology to include extra structure that is present in the case of complex algebraic varieties. It received little attention before Hodge presented it in an address during the 1950 International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Hodge conjecture is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millennium Prize Problems, with a prize of $1,000,000 for whoever can prove or disprove the Hodge conjecture.\n\nLet \"X\" be a compact complex manifold of complex dimension \"n\". Then \"X\" is an orientable smooth manifold of real dimension 2\"n\", so its cohomology groups lie in degrees zero through 2\"n\". Assume \"X\" is a Kähler manifold, so that there is a decomposition on its cohomology with complex coefficients\n\nwhere \"H\"(\"X\") is the subgroup of cohomology classes which are represented by harmonic forms of type (\"p\", \"q\"). That is, these are the cohomology classes represented by differential forms which, in some choice of local coordinates \"z\", ..., \"z\", can be written as a harmonic function times\n(See Hodge theory for more details.) Taking wedge products of these harmonic representatives corresponds to the cup product in cohomology, so the cup product is compatible with the Hodge decomposition:\n\nSince \"X\" is a compact oriented manifold, \"X\" has a fundamental class.\n\nLet \"Z\" be a complex submanifold of \"X\" of dimension \"k\", and let \"i\" : \"Z\" → \"X\" be the inclusion map. Choose a differential form α of type (\"p\", \"q\"). We can integrate α over \"Z\":\n\nTo evaluate this integral, choose a point of \"Z\" and call it 0. Around 0, we can choose local coordinates \"z\", ..., \"z\" on \"X\" such that \"Z\" is just \"z\" = ... = \"z\" = 0. If \"p\" > \"k\", then α must contain some \"dz\" where \"z\" pulls back to zero on \"Z\". The same is true if \"q\" > \"k\". Consequently, this integral is zero if (\"p\", \"q\") ≠ (\"k\", \"k\").\n\nMore abstractly, the integral can be written as the cap product of the homology class of \"Z\" and the cohomology class represented by α. By Poincaré duality, the homology class of \"Z\" is dual to a cohomology class which we will call [\"Z\"], and the cap product can be computed by taking the cup product of [\"Z\"] and α and capping with the fundamental class of \"X\". Because [\"Z\"] is a cohomology class, it has a Hodge decomposition. By the computation we did above, if we cup this class with any class of type (\"p\", \"q\") ≠ (\"k\", \"k\"), then we get zero. Because \"H\"(\"X\", C) = \"H\"(\"X\"), we conclude that [\"Z\"] must lie in \"H\"(\"X\", C). Loosely speaking, the Hodge conjecture asks:\n\nLet:\n\nWe call this the group of \"Hodge classes\" of degree 2\"k\" on \"X\".\n\nThe modern statement of the Hodge conjecture is:\n\nA projective complex manifold is a complex manifold which can be embedded in complex projective space. Because projective space carries a Kähler metric, the Fubini–Study metric, such a manifold is always a Kähler manifold. By Chow's theorem, a projective complex manifold is also a smooth projective algebraic variety, that is, it is the zero set of a collection of homogeneous polynomials.\n\nAnother way of phrasing the Hodge conjecture involves the idea of an algebraic cycle. An \"algebraic cycle\" on \"X\" is a formal combination of subvarieties of \"X\"; that is, it is something of the form:\n\nThe coefficients are usually taken to be integral or rational. We define the cohomology class of an algebraic cycle to be the sum of the cohomology classes of its components. This is an example of the cycle class map of de Rham cohomology, see Weil cohomology. For example, the cohomology class of the above cycle would be:\n\nSuch a cohomology class is called \"algebraic\". With this notation, the Hodge conjecture becomes:\n\nThe assumption in the Hodge conjecture that \"X\" be algebraic (projective complex manifold) cannot be weakened. In 1977 Zucker showed that it is possible to construct a counterexample to the Hodge conjecture as complex tori with analytic rational cohomology of type (\"p\",\"p\"), which is not projective algebraic. (see appendix B of )\n\nThe first result on the Hodge conjecture is due to . In fact, it predates the conjecture and provided some of Hodge's motivation.\n\nA very quick proof can be given using sheaf cohomology and the exponential exact sequence. (The cohomology class of a divisor turns out to equal to its first Chern class.) Lefschetz's original proof proceeded by normal functions, which were introduced by Henri Poincaré. However, Griffiths transversality theorem shows that this approach cannot prove the Hodge conjecture for higher codimensional subvarieties.\n\nBy the Hard Lefschetz theorem, one can prove:\n\nCombining the above two theorems implies that Hodge conjecture is true for Hodge classes of degree formula_10. This proves the Hodge conjecture when formula_12 has dimension at most three.\n\nThe Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes also implies that if all Hodge classes are generated by the Hodge classes of divisors, then the Hodge conjecture is true:\n\nBy the strong and weak Lefschetz theorem, the only non-trivial part of the Hodge conjecture for hypersurfaces is the degree \"m\" part (i.e., the middle cohomology) of a 2\"m\"-dimensional hypersurface formula_16. If the degree \"d\" is 2, i.e., \"X\" is a quadric, the Hodge conjecture holds for all \"m\". For \"m\" = 2, i.e., fourfolds, the Hodge conjecture is known for formula_17.\n\nFor most abelian varieties, the algebra Hdg*(\"X\") is generated in degree one, so the Hodge conjecture holds. In particular, the Hodge conjecture holds for sufficiently general abelian varieties, for products of elliptic curves, and for simple abelian varieties of prime dimension. However, constructed an example of an abelian variety where Hdg(\"X\") is not generated by products of divisor classes. generalized this example by showing that whenever the variety has complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field, then Hdg(\"X\") is not generated by products of divisor classes. proved that in dimension less than 5, either Hdg*(\"X\") is generated in degree one, or the variety has complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field. In the latter case, the Hodge conjecture is only known in special cases.\n\nHodge's original conjecture was:\n\nThis is now known to be false. The first counterexample was constructed by . Using K-theory, they constructed an example of a torsion cohomology class, that is, a cohomology class α such that for some positive integer \"n\", \"n\"α = 0, which is not the class of an algebraic cycle. Such a class is necessarily a Hodge class. reinterpreted their result in the framework of cobordism and found many examples of such classes.\n\nThe simplest adjustment of the integral Hodge conjecture is:\n\nEquivalently, after dividing \"H\"(\"X\", Z) ∩ \"H\"(\"X\") by torsion classes, every class is the image of the cohomology class of an integral algebraic cycle. This is also false. found an example of a Hodge class α which is not algebraic, but which has an integral multiple which is algebraic.\n\nA natural generalization of the Hodge conjecture would ask:\n\nThis is too optimistic, because there are not enough subvarieties to make this work. A possible substitute is to ask instead one of the two following questions:\n\nHodge made an additional, stronger conjecture than the integral Hodge conjecture. Say that a cohomology class on \"X\" is of \"co-level c\" (coniveau c) if it is the pushforward of a cohomology class on a \"c\"-codimensional subvariety of \"X\". The cohomology classes of co-level at least \"c\" filter the cohomology of \"X\", and it is easy to see that the \"c\"th step of the filtration \"N'H\"(\"X\", Z) satisfies\n\nHodge's original statement was:\nThis version is open.\n\nThe strongest evidence in favor of the Hodge conjecture is the algebraicity result of . Suppose that we vary the complex structure of \"X\" over a simply connected base. Then the topological cohomology of \"X\" does not change, but the Hodge decomposition does change. It is known that if the Hodge conjecture is true, then the locus of all points on the base where the cohomology of a fiber is a Hodge class is in fact an algebraic subset, that is, it is cut out by polynomial equations. Cattani, Deligne & Kaplan (1995) proved that this is always true, without assuming the Hodge conjecture.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2313342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2313342", "title": "Inuit grammar", "text": "Inuit grammar\n\nThe Inuit language, like other Eskimo–Aleut languages, exhibits a regular agglutinative and heavily suffixing morphology. The language is rich in suffixes, up to 700 per dialect, making words very long and potentially unique. For example, in Nunavut Inuktitut:\n\nThis long word is composed of a root word tusaa- – \"to hear\" – followed by seven suffixes (a vowel-beginning suffix always erases the final consonant of the preceding consonant-ending suffix):\n\nNote the consonant sandhi (see \"Inuit phonology\"): The /q/ from -tsiaq- followed by the /j/ from -junnaq- becomes ‹r› , a single consonant taking its point of articulation from /q/ and its manner of articulation from /j/. The /q/ from -junnaq- is assimilated into the /ŋŋ/ of -nngit-, because Inuktitut forbids triple length consonants, and because the morphophonological rules attached to -nngit- require it to delete any consonant that comes before it.\n\nThis sort of word construction is pervasive in Inuit language and makes it very unlike English. In one large Inuktitut corpus – the \"Nunavut Hansard\" – 92% of all words appear only once, in contrast to a small percentage in most English corpora of similar size. This makes the application of Zipf's law quite difficult.\n\nFurthermore, the notion of a part of speech can be somewhat complicated in Inuit language. Fully inflected verbs can be interpreted as nouns. The word ilisaijuq can be interpreted as a fully inflected verb – \"he studies\" – but can also be interpreted as a noun: \"student\".\n\nBecause of the language's rich and complicated morphology, this article can present only a limited and unsystematic sample of its features. It is based largely on the Inuktitut dialects of north Baffin Island and central Nunavut. The morphology and syntax of Inuit language varies to some degree between dialects, but the basic principles will generally apply to all of them and to some degree to Yupik as well.\n\nInuktitut verbs fall into two major categories with different morphological properties: \"non-specific verbs\" and \"specific verbs\". Many verbs belong in both categories, and can take either set of endings depending on the type of information about the verb's arguments that speakers intend to communicate. Others are restricted to one category or require a morphological change in order to move between categories.\n\nEvery fully inflected Inuktitut verb can act alone as a proposition. No other words are required to form a syntactically correct sentence.\n\nThis section will only cover two of the most common sets of endings for these two verb classes and a small selection of verbal modifiers. Inuktitut has a large and diverse set of verbal inflections, of which this article can only cover a small portion designed to give some sense of how the Inuktitut language works.\n\nNon-specific verbs are verbs that either are \"intransitive\" (they have no direct object), or have an \"indefinite noun\" as their object. In English, an indefinite noun is marked by the lack of the article \"the\" or, if the noun is singular (and countable) the article \"a(n)\". In Inuktitut, when it is the object of a verb, it is distinguished by the use of a non-specific verb and particular suffix described below. A definite noun, in contrast, requires the use of a \"specific verb\" when it is the object of a verb.\n\nAs a general rule, a correctly formed Inuktitut verb must start with a root and end with a suffix that indicates the grammatical person of its subject:\n\nThe indicative is the simplest form of the verb in Inuktitut, and for state verbs - verbs indicating a condition or a situation - this form indicates the present tense: The condition or situation is presently the case. For action verbs, it indicates that the action has recently been completed, mixing tense and aspect. Inuktitut verbs are divided into state verbs and action verbs. However, the distinction may not match how non-Inuktitut speakers would categorise verbs. For example, the verb root pisuk-, meaning \"to be walking\" - is a state verb in Inuktitut.\n\nWhen the verb root ends in a consonant, the suffixes that indicate the grammatical person all begin with t. For example, pisuk- - \"to be walking\" - is conjugated as follows:\n\nVerb roots that end in a vowel have suffixes that start with a j. For example, ani- - \"to go out\":\n\nNote that Inuktitut has a fully productive dual number, present in all three persons.\n\nThere is an alternative form of the above conjugation which is used in different ways and to different degrees depending on dialect. Instead of starting with t after a consonant and j after a vowel, this form starts with p after a consonant and v after a vowel. The exact difference varies from dialect to dialect. In western dialects, including Inuinnaqtun and Inupiatun, only the t/j forms are ever used for statements and the p/v form is rarely if ever heard. In Greenland, only the p/v form is used. In the central and eastern Canadian dialects, both forms are used.\n\nThere are additional p/v forms used in Nunavut to indicate interrogative statements - asking questions - although they may indicate other subtle distinctions of aspect. When they are used to ask questions, the last vowel may be doubled to indirectly indicate rising pitch. So, the question \"Are we there yet?\" can be written as \"?\" (tikip- - to arrive, and for -pita see the table below) but may also be written as \"?\"\n\nThis way, one can very compactly pose and answer simple yes/no questions:\n\nThe subject of a non-specific verb has no special morphological mark:\n\nThe object of a non-specific verb must end in a suffix that indicates its syntactic role:\n\nThe object of a non-specific verb takes one of the suffixes below, depending on its number:\n\nAn example using the verb taku- - \"to see\" - and inuviniq - \"dead person\":\n\nTo say \"I see the dead person\" or \"I see the dead people\" requires a \"specific verb\", which is described in the section below.\n\nSpecific verbs - verbs whose objects are definite as opposed to indefinite - take suffixes that indicate the grammatical person of both the subject and the object, but not their grammatical number.\n\nSpecific verb suffixes used after vowels:\nSpecific verb suffixes used after consonants:\nNote that the suffixes in this table cannot be used for reflexive verbs. That will be discussed separately.\n\nAs with non-specific verbs, specific verbs have an alternate v/p form used to the exclusion of j/t forms in Greenland, to some extent interchangeably in Nunavut, and not at all in the west:\n\nSpecific verb suffixes used after vowels:\nSpecific verb suffixes used after consonants:\nThe specific interrogative is also sometimes used to indicate conditional forms or other aspects. It overlaps heavily with the v/p alternative form described above:\n\nAfter vowels:\nAfter consonants:\nThe subject of a specific verb requires a specific suffix to indicate its syntactic role:\nThe subject of a specific verb takes the following suffixes, depending on its grammatical number:\n\nAll of the suffixes above delete any consonant that immediately precedes them. For example, qajaq becomes qajaup in the singular, qajaak in the dual, and qajait in the plural when it is the subject of a specific verb.\n\nSo, as an example:\nThe object of a specific verb needs no particular suffix at all. Thus, we can contrast Inuviniq takujara - \"I see the dead person\" - with the table for \"non-specific verbs\" above. Continuing the example from above:\nSome verbs are automatically both specific and non-specific verbs, depending only on which suffixes they receive. The verb taku- - \"to see\" - is one example. However, other verbs require an additional suffix to shift classes.\n\nMany action verbs that specifically involve an actor performing an action on another are \"specific verbs\" that take the suffix -si- in order to become \"non-specific verbs\":\nMany verbs of emotion alternate between the suffixes -suk- and -gi- to change whether or not they are specific:\nThis is important when attributing an emotion to a person without designating the cause. To do so, Inuktitut always uses the \"non-specific\" form:\nA reflexive verb is a verb which must have both an object and a subject, but where, in some context, both the object and the subject are identical. In Inuktitut, this situation is expressed by using a \"specific verb\" but by affixing a \"non-specific\" ending to it.\nA verb that has been fully inflected as described above is a complete proposition able to stand on its own. However, when clauses are linked in Inuktitut, a number of other morphosyntactic phenomena come into play.\n\nFirst, many secondary structures use other classes of verb suffixes that those used in main clauses. This article cannot cover the whole of Inuktitut morphology, especially since each class of inflexion has its own set of non-specific and specific endings and they vary significantly from dialect to dialect. The examples below are based on the North Baffin dialect.\n\nIn secondary clauses, third person inflexions must make a distinction between instances where the two clauses have the same subject and those where the subject is different. In English, the sentence \"He is leaving because he is tired\" is ambiguous unless you know whether or not the two \"he\"'s refer to different people. In Inuktitut, in contrast, this situation is clearly marked:\n\nThe set of suffixes used to indicate the other third person is sometimes called the third person different, but is also often called the fourth person. This additional grammatical person is a pervasive feature of Inuktitut.\n\nThe causative is used to link propositions that follow logically. It is much more broadly used in Inuktitut than similar structures are in English. The causative is one of the most important ways of connecting two clauses in Inuktitut:\n\nThis structure has a meaning closer to an \"if... then...\"' sentence in English than the kind of structure usually referred to as \"conditional\". It generally involves using an additional marker of the future tense or the conditional mood in the main clause:\n\nThe frequentative endings indicate that two propositions routinely occur together. In English, this is expressed with words like \"usually\", \"often\", \"generally\" and \"whenever\". It generally involves using an additional marker in the main clause to indicate frequency:\n\nThe dubitative suffixes express uncertainty or disbelief about a proposition:\n\nIn addition to root verb morphemes and inflexions to indicate the number and person of the arguments, Inuktitut has a large inventory of morphemes that modify the verb and may be placed between the root morpheme and inflexions, or at the end of the inflected verb. In pedagogic and linguistic literature on Inuktitut, these infix morphemes are often called verb chunks. These modifiers indicate tense, aspect, manner and a variety of functions that in English require auxiliary verbs, adverbs, or other structures.\n\nThis section can only list a small selection of the many verb chunks, in order to give a sense for how the system works:\n\nWhile Indo-European languages tend to make tense distinctions in terms of before or after some reference event, Inuktitut makes a number of somewhat fuzzy distinctions depending on how far into the past or the future the event took place. In English, this distinction requires additional words to place the event in time, but in Inuktitut the tense marker itself carries much of that information.\n\nInuktitut marks the subject of a non-specific verb and the object of a specific verb in the same way - the absence of a specific morphological marker - and marks the subject of a specific verb and the object of a non-specific verb with particular morphological elements. This kind of morphosyntactic structure is often called an ergative structure. However, ergativity in its most clearly defined instances is primarily about transitive and intransitive verbs. This dichotomy is not identical to the specific/non-specific verb distinction in Inuktitut, since Inuktitut usage is also concerned with the definiteness of the objects of verb,\n\nConsequently, the application of the notion of ergativity to Inuktitut, and to many other languages, is somewhat controversial. Regardless, by analogy with more conventionally ergative languages, the -up, -k, -it endings described above are often called \"ergative suffixes\" which are taken to be indicative of the \"ergative case\", while the -mik, -rnik, -nik endings (see Non-specific verbs - Objects) are called \"accusative\". This usage is often seen in linguistics literature describing Inuktitut, and sometimes in pedagogic literature and dictionaries, but remains a quite foreign vocabulary to most Inuit.\n\n\n\n\"Although as many of the examples as possible are novel or extracted from Inuktitut texts, some of the examples in this article are drawn from \"Introductory Inuktitut\" and \"Inuktitut Linguistics for Technocrats\".\"\n\nDictionaries and lexica\n\nWebpages\n"}

{"id": "2387156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2387156", "title": "Iris printer", "text": "Iris printer\n\nAn Iris printer is a large-format color inkjet printer introduced in 1985 by Iris Graphics, originally of Stoneham, Massachusetts and currently manufactured by the Graphic Communications Group of Eastman Kodak, designed for prepress proofing. It is also used in the fine art reproduction market as a final output digital printing press, as in Giclée.\n\nPrints produced by an Iris printer are commonly called Iris prints, Iris proofs or simply Irises.\n\nThe Iris printer was developed by Iris Graphics, Inc. originally of Stoneham, Massachusetts. Iris was founded in 1984 by two former employees of Applicon, Inc., Dieter Jochimsen and Craig Surprise, who had worked with Professor Helmuth Hertz of Lund University in Sweden from whom Applicon had licensed the continuous-flow inkjet technology used in an Applicon-manufactured large-format printer. Jochimsen and Surprise were joined in founding Iris by John Oberteuffer and Richard Santos after being introduced by the U.S. licensing agent for Professor Hertz' inkjet patents, Arthur D. Little of Lexington, MA. The Iris model 2044 large-format printer, capable of printing on paper up to 34\" x 44\" (864 x 1118 mm), was first shipped in 1985. A smaller model 3024, supporting automatic handling of 11\" x 17\" (279 x 432 mm) paper, was introduced at the September 1987 \"Lasers in Graphics\" show in Miami. The company was acquired by Scitex in 1990, which was then purchased by Creo Products Inc. in 2000. In 2005, Creo was purchased by Kodak. The Iris product line evolved into the Veris printer line\n\nThe Iris printer is an inkjet printer designed to interface with digital prepress systems to produce a hard copy that shows what the exact image will look like before the job goes to press. Such prepress output devices are used to check the image and for critical color match on industrial printing jobs such as commercial product packaging and magazine layout. Their output is also used to check color after mass production begins. Iris printers use a continuous flow ink system to produce continuous-tone dot free output. The paper used in the machine is mounted on a drum rotating at 150 inches per second. Unlike most ink jet printers which fire drops only when needed, the IRIS printer's four 1-micrometer glass jets operate continuously under high pressure, vibrated by a piezoelectric crystal to produce drops at a 1 MHz rate. The droplets are given an electric charge so that the ones that are not needed to form the image are deflected electrostatically into a waste system.\n\nIris printers have also been used since the late 1980s as final output digital printing devices in the production of fine art reproductions on various media, including paper, canvas, silk, linen and other textiles. There were many printers, photographers, artists, and engineers who saw the merit in using this industrial proof printer as a way to produce high-resolution color accurate reproductions. Color engineer David Coons used the 3024 at the Walt Disney Company to print images from Disney’s new computer 3D animation system. He also wrote software to print works created on desktop computers such as Sally Larsen 1989 \"Transformer\" series, and a 1990 photo exhibition for Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Nash was so impressed with the quality of the Iris prints, he purchased his own Iris Graphics 3047 ink-jet printer for $126,000 to print further editions of his work and eventually set up Nash Editions, a digital reproduction company based on the Iris printer. There were many problems with adapting the Iris printer to fine art printing including modifying the machines to take heavy paper stock and dealing with the poorly fade-resistant (fugitive) nature of the inks.\n\nBecause of the Iris printer's connection to digital, ink-jet industrial and home/office printing, one of the print makers at Nash Editions, Jack Duganne, thought such terms might have bad connotations in the art world. He came up with a neologism for the process, the coined name \"giclée\". Similarly, Nash and Mac Holbert, manager of Nash Editions, came up with the name \"digigraph\" for this type of print.\n\nIn the 2010s the Iris printer was for the most part superseded in the fine art printing business by Epson and other large-format printers that are much cheaper than the Iris and use inks designed to be archival.\n\n"}

Kawi is a standardised form of Old Javanese, a language with a sizable vocabulary of Sanskrit loanwords. Kawi is also the direct ancestor language of modern Javanese. The name \"kawi\" is derived from the root \"ku\", which in Sanskrit means “poet”, and, in derived forms, a “wise, educated man”. The syllabic meter of Kawi poetry is \"sekar kawi\", which means “flowers of the language”, sekar itself deriving from the Sanskrit \"sekhara\" (“garland”). All Javanese languages are hierarchical and stratified, with strict social conventions for appropriate language subsets to be used for one's superiors or social and cultural functions. Kawi is commonly considered the pinnacle language.\n\nKawi uses a unique script for writing commonly called hanacaraka; the more correct term is \"Dentawiyanjana\". It is a syllabic alphabet consisting of 20 letters and ten numbers and a number of vowel and consonant modifiers. The script of the island of Bali, heavily influenced by neighboring Java, has a unique sub-form called Tulisan Bali. Prince Aji Caka (an Indian migrant) is credited with establishing the first known kingdom of Java, called Java Dvipa (Swarna Dvipa) and also introducing the Kawi language was and the twenty letters of the syllabic hanacaraka script. The Javanese also credit the language to Aji Saka, a legendary hero of Medang Kamulan Kingdom. The earliest known inscription of Kawi is found at Gunung Wukir Temple in Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia.\n\nKawi is not truly extinct as a spoken language. It is commonly used in wayang golek, wayang wong and wayang kulit, in addition to high activities such as a Javanese wedding, especially for the stylised meeting ritual of bride's parents with groom's parents in the ceremonies of Peningsetan and Panggih. Archaically or for certain nobles very strongly attached to tradition, it is used for the Midodareni, Siraman and Sungkeman ceremonies of the Javanese wedding.\n\nThe island of Lombok has adopted Kawi as its regional language, reflecting the very strong influence of neighbouring East Java. Today, it is taught in primary school education as part of the compulsory secondary language unit of National curriculum. Traditionally, Kawi is written on lontar prepared palm leaves.\n\nKawi remains in occasional use as an archaic prose and literary language, in a similar fashion to Shakespeare-era English, which has such aesthetically and arguably more cultivated words as thy, thee, hast and so forth.\n\nThere are many important literary works written in Kawi, most notably Empu Tantular's epic poem, \"Kakawin Sutasoma\" (E.M. Uhlenbeck, 1964: \"A Critical Survey of Studies on the Languages of Java and Madura\", The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff), from which is taken the National motto of Indonesia: \"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\". Although often glibly translated as \"Unity in Diversity\", it is more correctly rendered as \"[although] scattered, remaining [as] one\"— referring to the scattered islands of the archipelago nation, not as an expression of multicultural solidarity as may be perceived in modern times.\n\nA more modern work is the poem \"Susila Budhi Dharma\", by Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo, the founder of Subud. In this work, he provides a framework for understanding the experience of the latihan kejiwaan.\n\nFamous poems, epics and other literature include:\n\nThe following are notable authors of Kawi:\n\nThe first scholar to address Kawi in a serious academic manner was Humboldt, who considered it the father of all Malay-Polynesian languages. Furthermore, he deprecated misconceptions about Kawi being wholly influenced by Sanskrit, finding that Kawi did not use verb inflexion, thus differing from Sanskrit's highly developed inflectional system. Kawi might have came from a very ancient settlement in the pacific side of Asia. In Kawi language, the meaning of a sentence must be grasped through word order and context. Humboldt further noted that Kawi utilizes tense distinctions, with past, present, and future, and differentiated moods via the imperative and subjunctive.\n\nNumerous scholars have studied the language, including the Dutch expatriate Indonesian Prof. Dr. Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder S.J., who contributed an enormous quantity of original texts and serious scholarly study to the language, and his pupil and associate, Father Dr. Ignatius Kuntara Wiryamartana. Other eminent Indonesian scholars of the language include Poedjawijatna, Sumarti Suprayitna, Poerbatjaraka and Tardjan Hadiwidjaja.\n\n\n\n"}

This taxonomy might be extended to scientific theories in general, and from there even stretched into the realm of the aesthetics of art. This present article's use of the phrase as a \"terminus technicus\" should not be confused with its everyday language uses.\n\nThe \"potency\" criterion alluded to in the preceding section is somewhat ill-defined, but may include \"exhaustiveness\", \"effectiveness', and an affective component as well. (Arguably, the taxonomy is also motivated by considerations of \"elegance\". This should not be confused with the application of the taxonomy in the field of aesthetics). As a metatheory, or \"theory of theories\", it becomes a concept of epistemology in the philosophy of science, rather than a mere tool or methodology of scientific linguistics. As Chomsky put it in an earlier work:\nThe theory of linguistic structure must be distinguished clearly from a manual of helpful procedures for the discovery of grammars.\n\nTheories which do not achieve the third level of adequacy are said to \"account for the observations\", rather than to \"explain the observations.\"\n\nThe second and third levels include the assumption of Ockhamist parsimony. This is related to the \"Minimalist\" requirement, which is elaborated as a corollary of the levels, but which is actually employed as an axiom.\n\nIt is suggested that the system of levels proposed by Chomsky in \"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax\" has its antecedents in the works of Descartes, Kant, Carnap, Quine, and others. Certainly the criterion of adequacy found in rationalism, specifically, rational empiricism, bear some resemblance to Chomsky's formulation.\n\nSince one of the key issues which Chomsky treats in \"Aspects\" is a supposition of a congenital endowment of the language faculty in humans, the topic ramifies into questions of innateness and \"a priori\" knowledge, since it is by reference to those questions that the third level of adequacy is to be sought.\n\nThis concept should not to be confused with the \"causal adequacy principle,\" which refers to Descartes' version of the ontological argument for the existence of God in his \"Meditations on First Philosophy\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "263276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263276", "title": "Mooring (watercraft)", "text": "Mooring (watercraft)\n\nA mooring refers to any permanent structure to which a vessel may be secured. Examples include quays, wharfs, jetties, piers, anchor buoys, and mooring buoys. A ship is secured to a mooring to forestall free movement of the ship on the water. An \"anchor mooring\" fixes a vessel's position relative to a point on the bottom of a waterway without connecting the vessel to shore. As a verb, \"mooring\" refers to the act of attaching a vessel to a mooring.\n\nThe term likely stems from the Dutch verb \"meren\" (to \"moor\"), used in English since the end of the 15th century.\n\nThese moorings are used instead of temporary anchors because they have considerably more holding power, cause less damage to the marine environment, and are convenient. Where there is a row of moorings they are termed a tier. They are also occasionally used to hold floating docks in place. There are several kinds of moorings:\n\nSwing moorings also known as simple or single-point moorings, are the simplest and most common kind of mooring. A swing mooring consists of a single anchor at the bottom of a waterway with a rode (a rope, cable, or chain) running to a float on the surface. The float allows a vessel to find the rode and connect to the anchor. These anchors are known as swing moorings because a vessel attached to this kind of mooring swings in a circle when the direction of wind or tide changes.\n\nFor a small boat (e.g. 22' / 6.7 m sailing yacht), this might consist of a heavy weight on the seabed, a 12 mm or 14 mm rising chain attached to the \"anchor\", and a bridle made from 20 mm nylon rope, steel cable, or a 16 mm combination steel wire material. The heavy weight (anchor) should be a dense material. Old rail wagon wheels are used in some places (e.g. Clontarf, Dublin, Ireland) for this purpose. In some harbours (e.g. Dun Laoghaire, Ireland), very heavy chain (e.g. old ship anchor chain) may be placed in a grid pattern on the sea bed to ensure orderly positioning of moorings. Ropes (particularly for marker buoys and messenger lines) should be \"non floating\" to reduce likelihood of a boat's prop being fouled by one.\n\nPile moorings are poles driven into the bottom of the waterway with their tops above the water. Vessels then tie mooring lines to two or four piles to fix their position between those piles. Pile moorings are common in New Zealand but rare elsewhere.\n\nWhile many mooring buoys are privately owned, some are available for public use. For example, on the Great Barrier Reef off the Australian coast, a vast number of public moorings are set out in popular areas where boats can moor. This is to avoid the massive damage that would be caused by many vessels anchoring.\n\nThere are four basic types of permanent anchors used in moorings:\n\n\nA vessel can be made fast to any variety of shore fixtures from trees and rocks to specially constructed areas such as piers and quays. The word pier is used in the following explanation in a generic sense.\n\nMooring is often accomplished using thick ropes called \"mooring lines\" or \"hawsers\". The lines are fixed to deck fittings on the vessel at one end and to fittings such as bollards, rings, and cleats on the other end.\n\nMooring requires cooperation between people on a pier and on a vessel. Heavy mooring lines are often passed from larger vessels to people on a mooring by smaller, weighted heaving lines. Once a mooring line is attached to a bollard, it is pulled tight. Large ships generally tighten their mooring lines using heavy machinery called \"mooring winches\" or \"capstans\".\nThe heaviest cargo ships may require more than a dozen mooring lines. Small vessels can generally be moored by four to six mooring lines.\n\nMooring lines are usually made from manila rope or a synthetic material such as nylon. Nylon is easy to work with and lasts for years, but it is highly elastic. This elasticity has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that during an event, such as a high wind or the close passing of another ship, stress can be spread across several lines. However, should a highly stressed nylon line break, it may part catastrophically, causing \"snapback\", which can fatally injure bystanders. The effect of \"snapback\" is analogous to stretching a rubber band to its breaking point between your hands and then suffering a stinging blow from its suddenly flexing broken ends. Such a blow from a heavy mooring line carries much more force and can inflict severe injuries or even sever limbs. Mooring lines made from materials such as Dyneema and Kevlar have much less elasticity and are therefore much safer to use. However, such lines do not float on water and they do tend to sink. In addition, they are relatively more expensive than other sorts of line.\n\nSome ships use wire rope for one or more of their mooring lines. Wire rope is hard to handle and maintain. There is also risk associated with using wire rope on a ship's stern in the vicinity of its propeller.\n\nMooring lines and hawsers may also be made by combining wire rope and synthetic line. Such lines are more elastic and easier to handle than wire rope, but they are not as elastic as pure synthetic line. Special safety precautions must be followed when constructing a combination mooring line.\n\nThe two-headed mooring bitts is a fitting often-used in mooring. The rope is hauled over the bitt, pulling the vessel toward the bitt. In the second step, the rope is tied to the bitt, as shown. This tie can be put and released very quickly. In quiet conditions, such as on a lake, one person can moor a 260-tonne ship in just a few minutes.\n\nQuick release mooring hooks provide an alternative method of securing the rope to the quay: such a system \"greatly reduces the need for port staff to handle heavy mooring ropes … means staff have to spend less time on exposed areas of the dock, and [reduces] the risk of back injuries from heavy lifting\". The Oil Companies International Marine Forum recommend the use of such hooks in oil and gas terminals.\n\nThe basic rode system is a line, cable, or chain several times longer than the depth of the water running from the anchor to the mooring buoy, the longer the rode is the shallower the angle of force on the anchor (it has more scope). A shallower scope means more of the force is pulling horizontally so that ploughing into the substrate adds holding power but also increases the swinging circle of each mooring, so lowering the density of any given mooring field. By adding weight to the bottom of the rode, such as the use of a length of heavy chain, the angle of force can be dropped further. Unfortunately, this scrapes up the substrate in a circular area around the anchor. A buoy can be added along the lower portion of rode to hold it off the bottom and avoid this issue.\n\nNon-line mooring (\"hands-free\") is used where pier time is highly valuable, and includes suction cups or magnets. It can also be used between ships.\n\nMediterranean mooring, also known as \"med mooring\" or \"Tahitian mooring\", is a technique for mooring a vessel to pier. In a Mediterranean mooring the vessel sets a temporary anchor off the pier and then approaches the pier at a perpendicular angle. The vessel then runs two lines to the pier. Alternatively, simple moorings may be placed off the pier and vessels may tie to these instead of setting a temporary anchor. The advantage of Mediterranean mooring is that many more vessels can be connected to a fixed length of pier as they occupy only their width of pier rather than their length. The disadvantages of Mediterranean mooring are that it is more likely to result in collisions and that it is not practical in deep water or in regions with large tides.\n\nA mooring used to secure a small boat (capable of being beached) at sea so that it is accessible at all tides. Making a Travelling Mooring involves (1) the sinking of a heavy weight to which a block (pulley wheel) is attached at a place where the sea is sufficiently deep at low tide, (2) fitting a block / pulley wheel to a rock or secure point above the high tide mark, and (3) running a heavy rope with marker buoy between these blocks.\n\nMooring involves (a) beaching the boat, (b) drawing in the mooring point on the line (where the marker buoy is located), (c) attaching to the mooring line to the boat, and (d) then pulling the boat out and away from the beach so that it can be accessed at all tides.\n\nA mooring used to secure a Narrowboat (capable of traversing narrow UK canals and narrow locks) overnight, during off boat excursions or prolonged queuing for canal lock access. Water height with minimal exceptions, remain constant (not-tidal); there is water height variance in close proximity to locks.\n\nTypes of canal moorings are\n\nMooring pin (boat operator supplied) driven into the ground between the edge of the canal and the Towpath with a mooring-line rope to the boat.\n\nMooring hook (boat operator supplied) placed on the (permanent) canal-side rail with either (boat operator supplied) rope or chain-and-rope to the boat.\n\nMooring ring (permanent) affixed between the edge of the canal and the tow path, with (boat operator supplied) rope to the boat.\n\nMooring Bollard (permanent) affixed canal-side on lock-approaches for the short-term mooring of advancing boats and lock-side to assist in ascent and descent.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born on September 28, 1897 and raised in Semey (Kaskabulak).\n\nAuezov's writings were influenced by the poet Abai. Mukhtar's father and grandfather Omarkhan Auez both highly revered the poet, who was a neighbour and a friend of the Auezov family. His grandfather was a storyteller of folk tales, and taught his grandson to read and write.\n\nAuezov was born in a nomadic family from an area known today as Abay District, in East Kazakhstan Province. His grandfather taught him how to read and write. Auezov was educated at the Semipalatinsk Teacher's Seminary and Leningrad State University.\n\nAuezov is best known for his plays. The first play he authored was \"Enlik-Kebek\", a story of two young lovers that resembles the story of Romeo and Juliet. He authored more than twenty plays that dealt with the issues relevant to Socialism in Kazakhstan.\n\nAfter writing plays, Auezov changed his focus to writing novels. Two novels – \"Abay\" and \"The Path of Abay\" – dealing with the life of Kazakh poet Abay Qunanbayuli were the product of the last twenty years of his life.\n\nAuezov's other projects included drawing and translating literature into the Kazakh language. Some translations made by him include Nikolai Gogol's \"The Government Inspector\" and Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\".\n\nMukhtar first studied in Kaskabulak, then later a Muslim madrasa in Semipalatinsk. At age of eleven, he moved to a nearby, five-year grammar school. His father Omarkhan died in 1900, and his mother Nurzhamal in 1912. The young Mukhtar was raised by his uncle Kasymbek and his grandfather Auez and grandmother Dinas. In 1907, after a year of study in the madrasa, he was sent to the large Russian school in Semipalatinsk.\n\nMukhtar Auezov attended the Semipalatinsk Pedagogical Seminary after graduating from the City College. In the 1912–1913 academic year, Mukhtar finished the first seminary class with an award and went on to complete his studies at the Semipalatinsk Seminary in 1919. Around this time he began his acquaintance with Russian and other foreign classics of literature. At the same time, Auezov wrote short stories, poems and articles that began to be published.\n\n\"The young Auezov, according to the testimonies of the pedagogues, was marked for his impeccable attention, extraordinary gifts, slim build and aristocratic self-belief. He was an extraordinary sportsman and represented “Yarysh F C”, which at the time was the best football team in the city.\"\n\nMukhtar Auezov joined the faculty of a large state school, and he also worked holding various positions in the local government in Semipalatinsk with the Kazakh Central Executive Committee and in Orenburg.\n\nIn the summer of 1917, Auezov married a 15-year-old girl named Raihan. They had a daughter together in 1918 who they named Mugamilya (she lived until 2009), and a year later, in 1919, a son (who died in infancy). They got divorced in 1920.\n\nIn 1928 Mukhtar Auezov graduated from the Philological Faculty of Leningrad State University and completed his PhD at the University of Tashkent. During the 1930s, his endeavors as a professional writer began to take off. Mukhtar Auezov died during an operation in Moscow on 27 June 1961. He was buried in the Central Cemetery, Almaty. On his grave there stands a bust created by Yevgeny Vuchetich.\n\nAfter his death in 1961, the Government of the Republic Kazakhstan decided to perpetuate the name of the writer. The Institute of Literature and Art of the Academy of Sciences was renamed as the Auezov Institute of Literature and Art of the Academy of Sciences. Kazakh State Academic Drama Theatre, a literary memorial museum, a school, a street and an urban area in Almaty also bear his name.\n\nAuezov wrote numerous essays, short stories, and plays (many translated into other languages) in different genres.\n\nIn 1917, while he was studying at the seminary, he wrote “Enilik-Kebek\" (a play based on folk legends). The \"Enilik-Kebek\" play and the story \"Korgansyzdyn Kuni\", which was written in 1921 demonstrated to the world his great talent as a writer. \nFrom 1923 he began to devote all his energy to the literary arts and to work productively. In the period 1923–1926 he authored stories such as \"Okygan azamat\", \"Kyr suretteri\", \"Uilenu\", \"Eskilik kolenkesinde\", \"Kinamshil boizhetken\", \"Karaly sulu\".\n\nDuring the period 1923–1928 years he studied and then graduated from Leningrad University in the Faculty of Language and Literature. During the last two years of his studies In Leningrad (St. Petersburg), he wrote two highly acclaimed novels: \"Karash-karash\" and \"Kokserek\".\n\nAuezov began working in depth with themes of Kazakh history. His fixation with history is demonstrated in his works \"Enilik-Kebek\", \"Khan Kene\", \"Kily zmaan\", \"Aiman – Sholpan\", and \"Karakypshak Kobylandy.\"\nFor 20 years he devoted himself to prose and plays, which have become classics of Kazakh literature. In the thirties, he wrote a series of stories, such as: \"Kasennin kubylystary\", \"Izder\", \"Shatkalan\", \"Kum men Askar\", \"Burtkiwi\", and plays like\" Aiman-Sholpan\", \"Tas tilek\", \"Shekarada\", \"Tungi saryn\".\n\nIn 1936 he published a piece of prose called \"Tatiananyn kyrdagy ani\" in the Kazakh press \"Kazak adebieti\", that was a section from the future novel of the same name. Some years after that(around 1940), with the cooperation of Leonid Sobolev, he wrote the \"Abai\" tragedy. \nThe great scientist and teacher, Auezov, worked on the history of Kazakhs literature, and the training of personnel. He was the founder of the Abai studies and the principal author and editor of the multivolume \"Kazak adebiet Tarihy\". He also wrote a monograph on the Kyrgyz epic Manas.\n\nAfter the Abai Joly epic, he began writing a new, large-scale epic that described a new era in the future. His first book of that period is called \"Osken orken\" and was first published posthumously in 1962. \nA period of blooming of Kazakh drama is associated with the works of Auezov. He wrote over twenty plays and translated such classic works of world and Russian drama as \"The Inspector\" by Gogol, Othello and The Taming of the Shrew 'by Shakespeare, Aristocrats by Nikolai Pogodin, Spring Love by Konstantin Trenyov, and Officer of the Navy by A. Kron.\n\nIn 1960, together with a group of Soviet writers, he visited the United States. In the summer of 1960, he started work on the series of essays named “The American Impressions”. From mid-summer 1960, he began work on the novel named “The Young Tribe”.\nIn March 1961, Auezov embarked on a visit to India that included participation in the work of the III International Congress for Peace in Delhi together with a delegation headed by Nikolai Tikhonov. In June of that same year, he planned to visit England, the land of Shakespeare, but his untimely death meant that his wish to travel to England did not occur. On June 3, 1961, he travelled to Moscow for medical tests. On June 27, 1961 – his heart failed during a surgical operation.\n\nIn his formative years, Mukhtar listened to the memories of his grandfather that told of Abai and Kunanbay. The destiny of Mukhtar Auezov was linked by many threads to the life of Abai the hero great inspiration of his life. Abai himself graced family celebrations, arranged for Auez to mark the birth of his grandson. Nurganym, one of the wives of Kunanbai father of Abai, was the sister of Auez.\n\nMukhtar later became friends with the son of Abai Turagulom and married Camille, granddaughter of the great poet, that is the daughter of Magauov.\nAuezov met Dilda, the first wife of Abai with whom he received a great deal of information. More information about Abai was forthcoming from Eigerim another of Abai’s life partners who survived her husband for more than a decade.\n\nMukhtar Omarhanuly for 15 years wrote his famous four-volume epic historical novel called \"Abai Joly\". It was translated into Russian. In 1949 two books of the novel \"Abai\" received the first level award of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This epic, which ended with four books, was awarded the Lenin prize. was translated into 30 languages, and received rave reviews from readers all over the world.\n\n\"Abai Zholy\" is one of the most popular and valuable novels written by Mukhtar Auezov. The first book of the series was published in 1942 and after five years in 1947 “Abai”, the second of the series was published, then came the third book in 1952 called “Abai aga” (Brother Abai). Finally, the fourth book was released in 1956. Later all of the books were repackaged and renamed as “Abai zholy” (The Path of Abai).\nThe first book and second books each have 7 chapters and one epilogue. The third book has 6 chapters as has the Fourth and one epilogue entire epic is divided into 20 short chapters each of which includes uniquely interesting situations.\n\nEach chapter’s name precisely demonstrates the psychological state of the events within the story. \nIf we compare there is much more drama, tragedy, sadness and sorrow than positive and happy moments. In the first book we can clearly see how the young and inexperienced boy grows up and at the end of the fourth book we see how he became an adult and changed and who ultimately fails.\n\nMukhtar Auezov wrote the libretto of the opera \"Abai\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lakshmikutty Amma, on 27 May 1931 at Chavara, Kollam (Quilon) in Kerala. He lost his father when he was eight. His childhood days were spent in Chavara where he attended the government school. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in Economics from SN College, Kollam, he moved to Thiruvananthapuram city (Trivandrum) where he joined Travancore University (now Kerala University) and pursued Master of Arts in Malayalam literature.\n\nO.N.V. was a lecturer at Maharajas College – Ernakulam, University College – Trivandrum, Arts and Science College – Kozhikode, and Brennen College – Thalassery. He joined Government Women's College – Trivandrum as the Head of Malayalam Department. He was also a visiting professor at Calicut University. He retired from service in 1986.\n\nHe received the Jnanpith Award, India's highest literary award, for the year 2007. He was the fifth Jnanpith laureate from Kerala and the second Malayalam poet to win the prestigious award. According to a statement by Bharatiya Jnanpith, the trust which presents the award, Kurup began his career as a \"progressive writer and matured into a humanist though he never gave up his commitment to socialist ideology\".\n\nHe was settled at Vazhuthacaud in Thiruvananthapuram, with his wife Sarojini, who was also his student in his early days. His son Rajeev works with the Indian Railways Authority, and daughter Dr. Mayadevi is a noted gynaecologist in Aster Medicity, Cochin. Malayalam playback singer Aparna Rajeev is his granddaughter.\n\nO. N. V.'s first published poem was 'Munnottu' (Forward) which appeared in a local weekly in 1946. His first poetry collection, \"Porutunna Soundaryam\", came out in 1949. He published a book named \"Dahikunna Panapatram\" (The Thirsty Chalice) which was a collection of his early poems during 1946–1956.\n\nIn addition to the valuable contributions he had given to the Malayalam literature, he was one of the leading lyricists in Malayalam film/drama/album industry. He was the part of many dramas by Kerala People's Arts Club (KPAC) which has a major remark in the revolutionary movements of Kerala. \"Kalam Marunnu\" (1956) was his first film which was also the first film by the famous Malayalam composer G. Devarajan. Since then he has been active in film until date and was honoured with one national award and fourteen state awards (the most by a Malayalee). He has penned about 1000 songs in about 232 films and numerous songs for plays and albums. His partnerships with Salil Chowdhury and M. B. Sreenivasan were so popular in Malayalam film industry. He has made many hit songs with popular music directors, including G. Devarajan, Raveendran, V. Dakshinamoorthy, M. S. Baburaj, M. K. Arjunan, K. Raghavan, Shyam, Johnson, Bombay Ravi, Mohan Sithara, M. G. Radhakrishnan, S. P. Venkatesh, Ouseppachan, Vidhyadharan and M. Jayachandran.\n\n\nO. N.

He is credited with a revival of the Marathi musical theater (sangeet natya) in the 1960s.\n\nPurushottam Darwhekar studied in Nilcity High School, Nagpur. After B. Sc. B. T., he completed M. A. LL.B. with Gold Medal. He was a teacher at Kurve’s New Model High School, Hadas High School, and at Sule High School in Nagpur. He joined Balvihar (Akashvani radio, Nagpur) and thereafter became Script Writer and then Assistant Producer.\n\nDarwhekar was Assistant Producer at Delhi Doordarshan from 1961 to 1963, before moving to Mumbai All India Radio (Akashwani) as Producer. He worked as a member of the Stage Review Committee from 1974 to 1980.\n\nIn 1977, he was appointed Special Executive Magistrate. He was also the President of Films, Drama and Cultural Development Board in the same year. He was made the President of Baroda Marathi Sahitya Mandal. He also served as the President of 58th Drama Conference at Pune and by then he was an honorable personality of Marathi Theatre.\n\nHe was appointed as Producer in Mumbai Doordrashan in 1986. By the time he retired, he had produced 700 scripts in Hawamahal, Balvihar, and Doordarshan serials, including serials on Pandit Nehru and the China War.

This practice conflicts with the use of the letter \"Ø\" in the Danish and Norwegian languages, and the empty set character \"∅\" used in set theory. Forms that avoid confusion with Danish include: \n\nConfusion between the numeral 0 and the letter O can be resolved by using a script letter O (with a loop at the top), and leaving the numeral 0 without embellishments; this was a common practice before use of the slashed zero became the norm\nThe numeral 1 — This numeral is sometimes written with a serif at the top extending downward and to the left. People in some parts of Europe extend this stroke nearly the whole distance to the baseline. It is sometimes written with horizontal serifs at the base; without them it can resemble the shape of the numeral \"7\", which has a near-vertical stroke without a crossbar, and a shorter horizontal top stroke. This numeral is often written as a plain vertical line without an ear at the top; this form is easily confused with the capital letter I and with the lower-case letter L.\n\nThe numeral 2 — In the U.S., Germany and Austria, a curly version used to be taught and is still used by many in handwriting. This 2 can be confused with a capital script Q, or a letter Z. It appears as ɚ.\n\nThe numeral 3 — This numeral is sometimes written with a flat top, similar to the character Ʒ (ezh). This form is sometimes used to prevent people from fraudulently changing a three into an eight.\n\nThe numeral 4 — Some people leave the top \"open\" — all the lines are either vertical or horizontal, as in a seven segment display. This makes it easier to distinguish from the numeral \"9\". Whether the horizontal bar terminates at or crosses the right vertical bar is insignificant in the West, but to be distinguished from certain Chinese characters (particularly 丩) it must cross.\n\nThe numeral 5 — In Taiwan, the left vertical bar is extended upwards as a long stem. If this is slanted, the overall figure may more closely resemble an uppercase \"Y\". If casually written it can be confused with a letter S.\n\nThe numeral 6 — Can be confused with a letter capital \"G\", or the lowercase \"b\", or the nine if inverted. In situations where the number 6 may appear at various angles (such as on billiard balls, some styles of playing cards and dice), it can be underlined (appearing as \"6\") or followed by a full stop (appearing as \"6.\") to indicate the proper viewing angle to disambiguate between \"6\" and \"9\"; a \"9\" may or may not appear with similar underlining or full stop (as \"9\" or \"9.\"). It can also be written with a straight line rather than a curly line on top, appearing as \"b\".\n\nThe numeral 7 — The traditional form found in copperplate penmanship begins with a serif at the upper left and has a wavy horizontal stroke (a swash). In East Asian countries (Korea, China and Japan), this numeral is commonly written with such a serif, but no swash and no crossbar through the middle. It is usually written with just two strokes, the top horizontal and the (usually angled) vertical. A short horizontal bar is sometimes used to cross the vertical in the middle, to distinguish the seven from a numeral one, especially in cultures (such as French) that write \"1\" with a very long upstroke. This form is used commonly throughout continental Europe, parts of the United States and frequently in Australia. In Taiwan two horizontal bars are sometimes used, although an extra-long serif is the feature which most clearly distinguishes \"7\" from \"1\". When the cross is added in the center it can cause confusion with a script capital \"F\".\n\nThe numeral 9 — In parts of Europe, this numeral is written with the vertical ending in a hook at the bottom. This version resembles how the lowercase letter codice_1 is commonly written. () Elsewhere the usual shape is to draw the vertical straight to the baseline. A nine may or may not appear with underlining or full stop (as \"9\" or \"9.\") in order to avoid confusion with \"6\". In China, southern Taiwan, and South Korea, the nine is sometimes written with the loop to the right of the stick, resembling the capital letter \"P\".\n\nThe lowercase letter a — Some writers put a double-story through the letter a, a practice that was used on some early, typefaces which displayed a hook top a. This practice conflicts with the use of the letter \"a\" in the Latin and Cyrillic small letters.\n\nRelations between the letter a and the Cyrillic letter a can be resolved by using a Latin script letter ɑ (with a single-story lowercase circle and a vertical line adjacent to the right of the circle without the hook top, also known as \"round-a\"); this is a common form in most cursive scripts, the two-story form being reintroduced in handwriting as cursive scripts lose ground to print scripts, where the two-story form is more common.\n\nThe lowercase letter g — In Polish, this letter is often rendered with a straight descender without a hook or loop. This effectively means that a handwritten g looks much like a q in other writing traditions. The letter q, which is only used in foreign words and is extremely rare, is then disambiguated from g by adding a serif (often undulated) extending to the right from the bottom tip of the descender.\n\nThe lowercase letter p — The French way of writing this character has a half-way ascender as the vertical extension of the descender, which also does not complete the bowl at the bottom. In early Finnish writing, the curve to the bottom was omitted, thus the resulting letter resembled a 'n' with a descender ('ɲ').\n\nThe lowercase letter q — In block letters, some Europeans like to cross the descender to prevent confusion with the numeral \"9\", which also can be written with a straight stem. In North America the descender often ends with a hook curving up to the right. () In Polish, the lowercase q is disambiguated from g by a serif extending from the bottom tip of the descender to the right.\n\nThe lowercase letter s — See long s.\n\nThe lowercase letter t — In block letters, t is often written with straight mark without the hook bottom. In modern cursive, the descender often ends with a hook to the right.\n\nThe lowercase letters u and v — These letters have a common origin and were once written according to the location in the word rather than the sound. The v came first; the u originally had a loop extending to the left and was only used to start words. All other locations for either u or v were written with the latter. In Germany (especially southern Germany), Austria and Switzerland, lowercase u is often written with a horizontal stroke or swish over it (\"ū\", \"ũ\"), to distinguish it from n.\nThe uppercase letter I — This letter is often written with one stroke on the top of the letter and one on the bottom. This distinguishes it from the lowercase letter l, and the numeral 1, which is often written as a straight line without the ear.\n\nThe uppercase letter J — In Germany, this letter is often written with a long stroke to the left at the top. This is to distinguish it from the capital letter \"I\".\n\nThe uppercase letter S — In Japan, this letter is often written with a single serif added to the end of the stroke.\n\nThe uppercase letter Z — This letter is usually written with three strokes. In parts of Europe such as Italy, Germany and Spain, it is commonly written with a short horizontal crossbar added through the middle. This version is sometimes preferred in mathematics to help distinguish it from the numeral \"2\". In Polish, the character Ƶ is used as an allographic variant of the letter Ż. In Japan it is often written with a short diagonal crossbar through the middle. () In France, it is often written with a loop at the bottom.\n\nGerman Kurrent and its modernized 20th century school version Sütterlin, the form of handwriting taught in schools and generally used in Germany and Austria until it was banned by the Nazis in 1941, was very different from that used in other European countries. However, it was generally only used for German words. Any foreign words included in the text would usually be written in the \"normal\" script, which was called the \"lateinische Schrift\" (Latin script) in German.\n\nThe slant of a sample of writing is a reflection of the copybook that is taught. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "444216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=444216", "title": "Riksmål", "text": "Riksmål\n\nRiksmål is a written Norwegian language form, meaning the \"National Language\", based on the Dano-Norwegian language used by the upper class in Christiania (modern Oslo) in the 19th century.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the union with Denmark in 1814, Norway had no national language standard of its own, the written language being Danish, while the verbal language consisted of numerous dialects – that to some extent were not mutually intelligible. The new union partner Sweden had a different language, Swedish, and there was a fear that if no measures were taken, its language would be imposed upon the Norwegians.\n\nHence, prominent Norwegians, such as Henrik Wergeland and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, advocated a standardized Norwegian language, to be based on the legacy of the Danish language as used in Norway by the upper class of Christiania. This was proposed by Knud Knudsen, a schoolteacher, who had witnessed how schoolchildren struggled with the Danish language they were taught, since it was very different from the spoken language they were used to. However, as late as in 1883 the Danish intellectual Georg Brandes stated that the language in Norway was Danish, and that the Norwegians did not have a language of their own.\n\nKnud Knudsen presented his Norwegian language in several works from the 1850s until his death in 1895, while the term \"Riksmaal\" (\"aa\" is a contemporary way of writing \"å\") was first proposed by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in 1899 as a name for the Norwegian variety of written Danish as well as spoken Dano-Norwegian. It was borrowed from Denmark where it denoted standard written and spoken Danish. The same year the Riksmål movement became organised under his leadership in order to fight against the growing influence of Nynorsk, eventually leading to the foundation of the non-governmental organisation Riksmålsforbundet in 1907. Bjørnson became its first leader, until his death in 1910.\n\nRiksmål became the chosen language for Norwegian pupils from the latter part of the 19th century, and Norwegian newspapers adapted to the language. However, many Norwegian authors, such as Henrik Ibsen, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Knut Hamsun, did not adhere and continued using Danish. Riksmål got an official writing norm in 1907, and in 1917 a new reform introduced some elements from Norwegian dialects and Nynorsk as optional alternatives to traditional Dano-Norwegian forms. This was part of an official policy to bring the two Norwegian languages more closely together, intending eventually to merge them into one. These changes met resistance from the Riksmål movement, and \"Riksmålsvernet\" (The Society for the Protection of Riksmål) was founded in 1919. They have later been the purist protectors of the traditional riksmål, in opposition to Bokmål and Nynorsk, and especially Samnorsk.\n\nIn the 1938 reform of Bokmål introduced more elements from dialects and Nynorsk, and more importantly, many traditional Dano-Norwegian forms were excluded. This so-called \"radical\" Bokmål or \"\" (Common Norwegian) met even stiffer resistance from the Riksmål movement, culminating in the 1950s under the leadership of Arnulf Øverland. Riksmålsforbundet organised a parents' campaign against Samnorsk in 1951, and the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature was founded in 1953. Because of this resistance, the 1959 reform was relatively modest, and the radical reforms were partially reverted in 1981 and 2005.\n\nCurrently, Riksmål denotes the moderate, chiefly pre-1938, unofficial variant of Bokmål, which is still in use and is regulated by the Norwegian Academy and promoted by Riksmålsforbundet. Riksmål has gone through some spelling reforms, but none as profound as the ones that shaped Bokmål. A Riksmål dictionary was published in four volumes in the period 1937 to 1957 by Riksmålsvernet, and two supplementary volumes were published in 1995 by the Norwegian Academy. After the latest Bokmål reforms in 2005, the difference between Bokmål and Riksmål have diminished and they are now comparable to American and British English differences, but the Norwegian Academy still upholds its own standard.\n\nThe daily newspaper \"Aftenposten\" is notable for its use of Riksmål as its standard language. Use of Riksmål is rigorously pursued, even with regard to readers' letters, which are \"translated\" into the standard.\n"}
{"id": "14693108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14693108", "title": "Riparian buffer", "text": "Riparian buffer\n\nA riparian buffer or stream buffer is a vegetated area (a \"buffer strip\") near a stream, usually forested, which helps shade and partially protect the stream from the impact of adjacent land uses. It plays a key role in increasing water quality in associated streams, rivers, and lakes, thus providing environmental benefits. With the decline of many aquatic ecosystems due to agriculture, riparian buffers have become a very common conservation practice aimed at increasing water quality and reducing pollution.\n\nRiparian buffers act to intercept sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other materials in surface runoff and reduce nutrients and other pollutants in shallow subsurface water flow. They also serve to provide habitat and wildlife corridors in primarily agricultural areas. They can also be key in reducing erosion by providing stream bank stabilization.\n\n\n\n\nA riparian buffer is usually split into three different zones, each having its own specific purpose for filtering runoff and interacting with the adjacent aquatic system. Buffer design is a key element in the effectiveness of the buffer. It is generally recommended that native species be chosen to plant in these three zones, with the general width of the buffer being on each side of the stream.\n\nZone 1. This zone should function mainly to shade the water source and act as a bank stabilizer. The zone should include large native tree species that grow fast and can quickly act to perform these tasks. Although this is usually the smallest of the three zones and absorbs the fewest contaminants, most of the contaminants have been eliminated by Zone 2 and Zone 3.\n\nZone 2. Usually made up of native shrubs, this zone provides a habitat for wildlife, including nesting areas for bird species. This zone also acts to slow and absorb contaminants that Zone 3 has missed. The zone is an important transition between grassland and forest.\n\nZone 3. This zone is important as the first line of defense against contaminants. It consists mostly of native grasses and serves primarily to slow water runoff and begin to absorb contaminants before they reach the other zones. Although these grass strips should be one of the widest zones, they are also the easiest to install.\n\nStreambed Zone. The streambed zone of the riparian area is linked closely to Zone 1. Zone 1 provides fallen limbs, trees, and tree roots that in turn slow water flow, reducing erosional processes associated with increased water flow and flooding. This woody debris also increases habitat and cover for various aquatic species\n\nThe National Agroforestry Center has developed a Filter Strip Design tool (AgBufferBuilder), which is a GIS-based computer program for designing vegetative filter strips around agricultural fields that utilizes terrain analysis to account for spatially non-uniform runoff.\n\nIn Zone 1: Cottonwood, Bur Oak, Hackberry, Swamp White Oak, Siberian Elm, Honeylocust, Silver Maple, Black Walnut, and Northern Red Oak.\n\nIn Zone 2: manchurian apricot, Silver Buffaloberry, Caragana, Black Cherry, Chokecherry, Sandcherry, Peking Cotoneaster, Midwest Crabapple, Golden Currant, Elderberry, Washington Hawthorn, American Hazel, Amur Honeysuckle, Common Lilac, Amur Maple, American Plum, and Skunkbush Sumac.\n\nIn Zone 3: Western Wheatgrass, Big Bluestem, Sand Bluestem, Sideoats Grama, Blue Grama, Hairy Grama, Buffalo Grass, Sand Lovegrass, Switchgrass, Little Bluestem, Indiangrass, Prairie Cordgrass, Prairie Dropseed, Tall Dropseed, Needleandthread, Green Needlegrass.\n\nLogging is sometimes recommended as a management practice in riparian buffers, usually to provide economic incentive. However, some studies have shown that logging can harm wildlife populations, especially birds. A study by the University of Minnesota found that there was a correlation between the harvesting of timber in riparian buffers and a decline in bird populations. Therefore, logging is generally discouraged as an environmental practice, and left to be done in designated logging areas.\n\nThe Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a farming assistance program in the United States, provides many incentives to landowners to encourage them to install riparian buffers around water systems that have a high chance of non-point water pollution and are highly erodible. For example, the Nebraska system of Riparian Buffer Payments offers the following:\n\nThese incentives are offered to agriculturists to compensate them for their economic loss of taking this land out of production. If the land is highly erodible and produces little economic gain, it can sometimes be more economic to take advantage of these CRP programs.\n\nRiparian buffers have undergone much scrutiny about their effectiveness, resulting in thorough testing and monitoring. A study done by the University of Georgia, conducted over a nine-year period, monitored the amounts of fertilizers that reached the watershed from the source of the application. It found that these buffers removed at least 60% of the nitrogen in the runoff, and at least 65% of the phosphorus from the fertilizer application. The same study showed that the effectiveness of the Zone 3 was much greater than that of both Zone 1 and 2 at removing contaminants.. But another recent study did not find efficiency (or a very limiting capacity) for reducing glyphosate and AMPA leaching to streams ; Spontaneous herbaceous vegetation RBS is as efficient as Salix plantations and mesures of Glyphosate in runoff after a year, suggest an unexpected persistence and even a capacity of RBS to potentially favor glyphosate infiltration up to 70 cm depth in the soil.\n\nAfter the initial installation of the riparian buffer, relatively little maintenance needs to be performed to keep the buffer in good condition. Once the trees and grasses reach maturity, they regenerate naturally and make a more effective buffer. The sustainability of the riparian buffer makes it extremely attractive to landowners, since they do relatively little work and still receive payments. Riparian buffers have the potential to be the most effective ways to protect aquatic biodiversity, water quality and manage water resources in developing countries that lack the funds to install water treatment and supply systems in midsize and small towns.\n\n"}

The International Phonetic Alphabet symbol for secondary stress is a short vertical line preceding and at the foot of the secondarily stressed syllable: as before the \"nun\" in \"\" (the higher vertical line denotes primary stress). Another tradition in English is to assign acute and grave accents for primary and secondary stress: \"pronùnciátion\".\n\nMost languages have at most one degree of stress on the phonemic level. That is, each syllable has stress or it does not. Many languages have rhythmic stress; location of the stress may not be predictable, but when the location of one stressed syllable (which may be the primary stress) is known, certain syllables before or after can be predicted to also be stressed; these may have secondary stress. An example is Dutch, where the rule is that initial and final syllables (word boundaries) take secondary stress, then every alternate syllable before and after the primary stress, as long as two stressed syllables are not adjacent and stress does not fall on (there are, however, some exceptions to this rule). See . A similar rule applies in Romanian: secondary stress falls on every alternate syllable, starting with the first, as long as it does not fall adjacent to the primary stress. In other languages (including Egyptian Radio Arabic, Bhojpuri, Cayuga, Estonian, Hawaiian, Kaure, Malayalam, and Warrgamay), secondary stress can be predicted to fall on heavy syllables.\n\nHowever, in other languages the placement of secondary stress is not predictable, or may not be predictable (and thus be phonemic) for some words. This is frequently posited for Germanic languages, including English. For example, secondary stress is said to arise in compound words like \"vacuum cleaner\", where the first syllable of \"vacuum\" has primary stress, while the first syllable of \"cleaner\" is usually said to have secondary stress. However, this analysis is problematic; notes that these may be cases of full vs reduced unstressed vowels being interpreted as secondary stress vs unstressed. See Stress and vowel reduction in English for details.\n\nIn Norwegian, the pitch accent is lost from one of the roots in a compound word, but the erstwhile tonic syllable retains the full length (long vowel or geminate consonant) of a stressed syllable; this has sometimes been characterized as secondary stress.\n\n"}
{"id": "51691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51691", "title": "Stanley Unwin (comedian)", "text": "Stanley Unwin (comedian)\n\nStanley Unwin (7 June 1911 – 12 January 2002), sometimes billed as Professor Stanley Unwin, was an English comedian, actor and comic writer.\n\nHe invented his own comic language, \"Unwinese\", referred to in the film \"Carry On Regardless\" (1961) as \"gobbledygook\". Unwinese was a corrupted form of English in which many of the words were altered in playful and humorous ways, as in its description of Elvis Presley and his contemporaries as being \"wasp-waist and swivel-hippy\". Unwin claimed that the inspiration came from his mother, who once told him that on the way home she had \"falolloped (fallen) over\" and \"grazed her kneeclabbers\".\n\nUnwin's parents, Ivan Oswald Unwin and his wife Jessie Elizabeth, Brand, emigrated from the United Kingdom to South Africa in the early 1900s. Their son was born in Pretoria in 1911. Following his father's death in 1914, Unwin's mother arranged for the family to return to England. By 1919, Unwin had been sent to the National Children's Home in Congleton, Cheshire. In the late 1920s, he studied radio, television and languages at Regent Street Polytechnic in London.\n\nIn 1937, he married his wife Frances, with whom he had two daughters and a son. Unwin later stated that Unwinese had its roots in enlivening the bedtime stories that he used to tell his children. In 1940, he was given a job in transmitter maintenance for the BBC, and was assigned to the Borough Hill transmitting station in Daventry. Unwin, Frances and their nine-month-old daughter, Marion, moved to Long Buckby in Northamptonshire, where Unwin would reside for the rest of his life.\n\nUnwin's early career and training introduced him to wireless and radio communication, and this, coupled with work in the BBC's War Reporting Unit from about 1944, ultimately proved to be his passage into the media.\n\nWhile based in Birmingham from 1947 to 1951, Unwin made his first, accidental, transmission. While testing equipment, he handed the microphone to broadcaster F.R. \"Buck\" Buckley, who ad-libbed a spoof commentary about an imaginary sport called \"Fasche\". Buckley then encouraged Unwin to join in and introduced him as \"Codlington Corthusite\", handing back the microphonewhereupon Unwin continued in Unwinese. The recording was played back to two BBC producers, who added sound effects; it was eventually broadcast on Pat Dixon's \"Mirror of the Month\" programme and, after receiving a positive response, culminated in another sketch in which Unwin, playing a man from Atlantis, was interviewed about life in the sunken city. The broadcast produced Unwin's first fan mail, from Joyce Grenfell, who had been impressed by his performance. Since Grenfell was Unwin's heroine, the encouragement gave Unwin a boost and he was inspired to break into show business.\n\nAfter the war, while in Egypt and recording a series of shows by Frankie Howerd, Unwin was pushed onto the stage and told to \"do a turn\" after the actor suddenly fell ill. Unwin's next major breakthrough came when producer Roy Speer introduced him to the comedian Ted Ray. Once Ray had heard Unwin talking, he said simply: \"I want him in the series\"namely, \"The Spice of Life\", co-starring June Whitfield and Kenneth Connor. During the mid-1950s, Unwin performed in about a dozen shows for Speer and made the acquaintance of Johnnie Riscoe and his daughter, Patsy, who would become his managers for the rest of his career. By the end of the 1950s, Unwin had ventured into the film industry, being given a part in the Cardew Robinson film \"Fun at St Fanny's\" (1956).\n\nIn 1968 Unwin was invited to narrate \"Happiness Stan\", a six song fairy tale about a boy of the same name, taking up the entire side two of the Small Faces' album \"Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake\", which reached number 1 in the UK Albums Chart.\n\nIn 1969, Unwin appeared in Gerry Anderson's \"Supermarionation\" TV series \"The Secret Service\", both in person and as the voice of the puppet character Father Stanley Unwin, whose appearance was based on him. Episodes typically comprised one or more scenes in which the character of Unwin would attempt to baffle opponents with his gobbledegook. When Lew Grade, Anderson's financial backer and head of distributor ITC, was introduced to the Unwinese dialogue, he cancelled the production on the basis that viewers would not understand what Unwin was saying, despite the fact that such confusion was intentional.\n\nThough less active in later decades, Unwin continued to make occasional appearances. In the 1970s, he appeared on \"The Max Bygraves Show\" on ITV, sometimes speaking normally and sometimes in gobbledegook. In the final episode, Bygraves tested a number of gobbledegook phrases on Unwin, who claimed that he could not understand them. In 1985, Unwin recorded with Suns of Arqa on their album \"Ark of the Arqans\", providing spoken word accompaniment in Unwinese on the first three tracks. In 1987, he recorded again with Suns of Arqa on their track \"Erasmus Meets The Earthling\", featured on their album \"Seven\", and a remixed version of this track was released again in the 1990s. He appeared as himself in a hospital scene of Inside Victor Lewis-Smith. In 1994, Unwin collaborated with British dance music act Wubble-U on their single \"Petal\"; on its re-release in 1998, the track ranked number 55 in the UK Chart. In 1998, Unwin made a cameo appearance in the Aardman Animations series \"Rex the Runt\", as an accountant who speaks largely in fairly standard English, occasionally lapsing inexplicably into Unwinese.\n\nUnwinese, also known as \"Basic Engly Twenty Fido\", was an ornamented and mangled form of English in which many of the words were corrupted in a playful and humorous manner. Unwin's performances could be hilarious yet disorientating, although the meaning and context were always conveyed in a disguised and picturesque style. Unwinese may have been inspired in part by Lewis Carroll's 1871 poem \"Jabberwocky\".\n\nUnwin died at Danetre Hospital in Daventry on 12 January 2002. He is buried in the churchyard at Long Buckby, with Frances, who pre-deceased him. Their gravestone bears the epitaph, \"Reunitey in the heavenly-bodeDeep Joy!\".\n\nA thanksgiving service was held at St Lawrence's Church in Long Buckby and ended with a rendering of \"Bye Bye Blackbird\" by John Percival and friends. The valediction had been prepared by Unwin's family in his own style: \"Goodly Byelode loyal peeploders! Now all gatherymost to amuse it and have a tilty elbow or a nice cuffle-oteedeeOh Yes!\"\n\nSuns of Arqa released a tribute album to Unwin (entitled \"Tributey\") following his death, featuring a selection of his works with the band over the years, as well as various interviews.\n\nUnwin's work is considered to have been a significant influence on the two books written by John Lennon: \"In His Own Write\" (1964) and \"A Spaniard in the Works\" (1965).\n\n"}

It is closely related to the Chaga languages of Kenya and Tanzania. The Taveta language was erroneously re-classified by Jouni Maho (2009) as Daw'ida, however it is lexically and grammatically closest to Chasu (Pare). The Saghala (Northern Sagala, Sagalla) variety is distinct enough to be considered a language separate from Dawida.\n\nThe Daw'ida and Saghala varieties of Taita contain loanwords from two different South Cushitic languages, called Taita Cushitic, which are now extinct. It is likely that the Cushitic speakers were assimilated fairly recently, since lateral obstruents in the loanwords were still pronounced as such within living memory. However, those consonants have now been replaced by Bantu sounds.\n"}
{"id": "1185505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1185505", "title": "Trans bashing", "text": "Trans bashing\n\nTrans bashing is the act of victimizing a person emotionally, physically, sexually, or verbally because they are transgender or transsexual. The term has also been applied to hate speech directed at transgender people and at depictions of transgender people in the media that reinforce negative stereotypes about them.\n\nDiscrimination, including physical or sexual violence against trans people due to transphobia or homophobia, is a common occurrence for trans people. Hate crimes against trans people are common even recently, and \"in some instances, inaction by police or other government officials leads to the untimely deaths of transgender victims.\"\n\nOne of the most infamous incidents was the December 1993 rape and murder of Brandon Teena, a young trans man, by two male friends after they found out that he had been assigned female at birth. The events became internationally known when told in the feature film \"Boys Don't Cry\", which earned Hilary Swank an Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nUnlike gay bashing, trans bashing is committed because of the target's actual or perceived gender identity, not sexual orientation. However, a trans person may be gay bashed if the person perceives them as gay rather than transgender.\n\nAt least since the Stonewall riots in 1969, people from the greater trans communities have often been politically aligned with the lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities. However, researchers and some activists from the greater trans communities argue trans bashing should be categorized separately from violence committed on the basis of sexual orientation (\"gay-bashing\"). Anti-trans bias crimes have been conceptually and characteristically distinguished from homophobic crimes in the scholarly research. One argument is that conflating violence against trans peoples with violence against gay people erases the identities of people in the greater trans communities and the truth of what happens to them. However, campaigns against gay bashing and trans bashing are often seen as a common cause.\n\nIn one case, perpetrators accused of hate crimes against trans people have tried to use a trans panic defense, an extension of gay panic defense. The jury deadlocked, but there is evidence they rejected the trans-panic defense. One law journal provided an analysis of the trans-panic defense, arguing in part that the emotional premise of a trans panic defense (shock at discovering unexpected genitals) is different from the emotional premise of a gay panic defense (shock at being propositioned by a member of the same sex, perhaps because of one's repressed homosexuality).\n\nThe United Nations adopted their Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as the first global declaration of human rights. There are a number of articles in the declaration that have been suggested to specifically pertain to transgender people and violence (including, but not limited to, physical, psychological, legal, systemic, emotional, and political violence), although LGBT rights are not explicitly outlined in the document.\n\n\nIn the United States, currently seventeen states plus the District of Columbia have hate crime laws protecting people victimized on the basis of their gender identity (they are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.).\n\nIn the late 2000s in Seattle's gay village of Capitol Hill, there was evidence of an increase in incidents of trans bashing.\n\nThe Matthew Shepard Act expanded the federal hate crime laws to include gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. In order to qualify as a federal hate crime in the United States, the crime must include successful or attempted bodily injury due to the use of firearm, explosives, weapons, fire, or incendiary devices. Hate crimes are covered by state, rather than federal laws unless the victim or defendant travel across state lines or national borders; using an interstate commuting route; the weapon has been brought across state lines; or if the conduct interferes with or otherwise affects commerce across state lines. This means that, unless hate crimes under the federal definition occur in a way that does not just affect one state, states have the freedom to implement their own hate crime laws. The protections of these laws range widely. Pennsylvania, for example, has not included gender identity in their hate crime protections since it was rescinded from the law in 2008.\n\nBathroom bills are bills proposed with relation to bathroom access and gender identity. There have been a number of bills proposed in the United States intended to limit access to restrooms for those who do not identify with the sex on their birth certificate. Some of these bills are justified with the rationale of protecting cisgender women from violent acts committed by cisgender men entering their facilities under the pretense of identifying as transgender women, although there is no evidence thus far of any incidences of this.\n\nSome transgender people are content, and may even prefer, using gender-neutral bathrooms, but others expect the right to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. The Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network found that singling out trans students by offering them alternative facility options may backfire by increasing their chances of disengaging from school or dropping out entirely.\n\nIt is transgender people who are likely to be harassed in bathrooms by cisgender people, not the other way around. In one survey, 70 percent of the transgender respondents had faced discrimination when attempting to use a restroom of their gender identity, including \"denial of access to facilities, verbal harassment, and physical assault.\" An example of such harassment occurred in 2018, when California Republican Congressional candidate Jazmina Saavedra said she heard the \"voice of a man\" from a locked stall in the women's restroom of a fast-food restaurant in Los Angeles and filmed herself chasing the person out of the restaurant with assistance from the restaurant manager. In the video, Saavedra said she was prepared to use pepper spray and a stungun against the transgender woman. This kind of tactic can result in public outing of a transgender person's current or former gender identity.\n\nMalta passed the 'Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Sex Characteristics Act in 2015. This bill states that all citizens of Malta have the right to\n\nThis act protects the gender identity of a person at all times. It also states that \"person shall not be required to provide proof of a surgical procedure for total or partial genital reassignment, hormonal therapies or any other psychiatric, psychological or medical treatment to make use of the right to gender identity.\" The act allows parents to postpone listing gender on a child's birth certificate and prohibits “non-medically necessary treatments on the sex characteristics of a person.”\n\nMedia can contribute to trans bashing through misinformation and scare tactics. Transgender individuals are oftentimes misrepresented negatively in media, or not represented in media at all.Transgender individuals may be portrayed in the media as curiosities or oddities, as mentally unstable persons, and/ or as predators. A public example of this is the attention paid to the transition of Chelsea Manning, a transgender U.S. Army soldier imprisoned for releasing classified documents to WikiLeaks. A Fox News story on Manning's transition was introduced with the Aerosmith song \"Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\", while host Gretchen Carlson referred to Chelsea by her birth name, Bradley, mocking \"The New York Times\" for \"helping him\" by using Manning's preferred gender pronoun. The Army refused to let her grow her hair as long as female prisoners, and continued referring to her as Bradley \"to avoid confusion\" until a court mandated her preferred gender pronouns.\n\nAccording to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care (NTDSR), which surveyed 6,450 transgender and gender non-conforming people, people who do not identify with their birth sex face obstacles to getting healthcare and have a greater likelihood of facing health issues related to their gender identity.\n\nTransgender people experience greater mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, suicide attempts, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as physical health disparities (e.g., cardiovascular disease). Trans people also have a higher rate of suicide attempts than the population as a whole. In 2013, the 2.2% of U.S. adults had attempted suicide while 41% of trans people had attempted suicide in 2011. The rate of attempted suicide in transgender individuals increased to 51% for those bullied or harassed in school, 55% for those who recently lost a job due to bias, and 61% and 64% for those who were victims of physical and sexual assault, respectively.\nLow self-esteem in transgender people has been linked to being at high-risk for HIV transmission. In 2008, the rate of HIV in transgender women in North America was 27.7%.\n\nIn the 2010 and 2011 NTDSRs, 19% of the people surveyed reported having been refused medical care due to their gender identity and 50% reported lack of provider knowledge of transgender health needs.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, it is illegal for any health program receiving federal funding to discriminate based on gender identity. Discrimination includes refusal to admit, treat or provide any services that are available for other patients; subjection of patients to intrusive examination; harass or refuse to respond to harassment by other staff or patients; refusal to provide support services; obligation to participate in conversion therapy; and any sort of interference in the pursuit of health care rights.\n\nRace has been shown to compound manifestations of existing discrimination on the basis of gender identity.\nBlack trans women have the highest suicide rate of any other group in the United States, at almost half attempting in their lives, while cisgender black women attempt suicide at a rate of 1.7% on average. \nTrans students of color face higher rates of harassment and violence in schools. American Indian transgender students face the highest rates of sexual assault in school at 24%, followed by multiracial (18%), Asian (17%), and black (15%) students. White transgender students face a 9% rate of sexual assault in K–12.\nBlack trans women have a higher rate of HIV infection than other groups, with a 30.8–56.3% rate, versus 27.7% of MTF transgender people on average.\n\nIn the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 22% of respondents who had interacted with the police reported harassment due to bias. 20% reported denial of equal services. 48% reported being uncomfortable asking for police assistance. Respondents who had served time in jail reported a higher rate of harassment by officers than by others in jail. For all respondents, 7% reported being held in a jail cell solely due to gender identity expression, while this number was 41% for black and 21% for Latino trans respondents. \nTransgender people have reported being refused medical care, particularly hormone therapy, in prison, with black trans people and American Indian trans people with the highest reporting rates.\n\n\n"}

Born on Dhulikhel,Kavrepalanchok Nepal ; Udesh Shrestha came as a fifth child to Mr. Ram Shrestha and Mrs. Ram Pyari Shrestha.\n\nUdesh Shrestha started his musical career in 1999 by recording his first single track “Ghorahi Bazar.” However, he was not noticed in the music industry until 2005 when he released his debut album titled “Lovearea.” He became an immediate music sensation in the pop music of Nepal when his song Yo Junima featuring Bhugol Dahal went chartbusters in various TV and FM stations around the nation. Furthermore, his following tragic love ballad “Kina Mayama,” established him as a most promising artist with hundreds and thousands of fan follow up around the nation. He has won various nominations in various prestigious award ceremonies around the nation. In 2005, he was nominated in Hits Fm Music Award 2061 for Best Vocal Collaboration Song “Yo Junima” together with Bhugol Dahal for the album Lovearea. He has won various nominations in various prestigious national award ceremonies like Hits FM Music Award, Tuborg Image Awards, Music Khabar Music Award, Kalika FM Music Award and a lot more. He won the 14th Annual Tuborg Image Award for Best Vocal Performance Pop for the song Aansu Ko Thopa and 17th Annual Tuborg Image Award for Best Song With National Feelings for the song Uthau Uthau. He has been nominated on Tuborg Image Awards in 6 occasions where he's won a couple of times.\n\nFrom his early childhood, Udesh Shrestha was passionate about music. He used to learn various songs on his own. In 1993 (2050 BS), he started learning guitar with the limited resources. Performing in various festivals and school and college shows were his preliminary yet, the most strong foundation towards his future career as a pop star. He has had his musical quality made him unique in contrary to his colleagues while his schooling life in Shree Triveni Higher Secondary School. With the thrive for music, he studied his high school level in Lalitkala Music College, one of the most respected and only music and arts college (then.)\n\nToday, Udesh Shrestha is a celebrated name in the music industry of Nepal. However, reaching this height was not easy for him. His years and years of practice and training on classical music with renowned classical maestro like Professor Sangita Pradhan ( Rana ) and Dr. Homnath Upadhyaya has guided him to the right direction. Currently, he’s working for his 5th studio album due this fall. Also, Udesh is active in social causes too. He's working for Yes Humanity ( A Non-Profit Organization, Sydney Australia ) as Nepal Ambassador since 2015. He's also the spoke artist for the Nepal's one and only music streaming mobile app Yonder Music Nepal powered by Ncell , an Axiata Group company in collaboration with US-based Yonder Music Inc.\n\nShrestha’s earlier music were a blend of neo-pop fused with eastern semi-classical styles. Songs like Yo Junima, Bhakkano Futera and Kina Mayama are its examples. Yo Junima was his critically hit number with a blend of eastern classical raga and pop music merged in melodic style. His songs were about the tragic incidents of love life resulting in loneliness and pain. His first album have variations of songs ranging from melodic pop, soft-rock, folk pop and romantic music which he has continued in all of his albums with some minor experiments in his later albums. He plays guitar and piano too.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "984021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=984021", "title": "Yupik languages", "text": "Yupik languages\n\nThe Yupik languages are the several distinct languages of the several Yupik peoples of western and south-central Alaska and northeastern Siberia. The Yupik languages differ enough from one another that they are not mutually intelligible although speakers of one of the languages may understand the general idea of a conversation of speakers of another of the languages. One of them, Sirenik, has been an extinct language since 1997.\n\nThe Yupik languages are in the family of Eskimo–Aleut languages. The Aleut and Eskimo languages diverged about 2000 BC (contemporaneous with the split of Indo-Iranian); within the Eskimo classification, the Yupik languages diverged from each other and from the Inuit language about 1000 AD.\n\n\nCentral Yup'ik Consonants:\n\nc ~, g , gg , k, l , ll , m, ḿ (\"voiceless\" m), n (\"alveolar\"), ń (\"voiceless\" n), ng , ńg (\"voiceless\" ŋ), p, q , r , rr , s , ss , t (\"alveolar\"), û , v ~, vv , w , y , ' (\"gemination of preceding consonant\")\n\nYupik languages have four vowels: 'a', 'i', 'u' and schwa. They have from 13 to 27 consonants.\n\nCentral Yup'ik Vowels:\n\na, aa, e (ə) (\"schwa\"), i, ii, u, uu\n\nYup'ik verbs always begin with a root morpheme like \"kaig\"- to be hungry and always end with a pronoun.\n\nYupik is a polysynthetic language that can have analytic alternatives; speakers can express similar ideas in a series of words with a number of bound morphemes.\n\nThe stress pattern of Central Siberian and Central Alaskan is generally iambic where stress occurs on the second syllable of each two-syllable metrical foot. This can be seen in words consisting of light (L) syllables. Here, the parsing of syllables into feet is represented with parentheses:\n\nAs can be seen above, the footing of a Yupik word starts from the left edge of the word. (Therefore, a foot parsing of \"L(L'L)(L'L)\" is not permitted.) Syllables that cannot be parsed into feet in words with an odd number of syllables are not stressed. (Thus, a parsing of \"(L'L)('L)\" is impossible.)\n\nAdditionally, heavy (H) syllables (consisting of two moras) are obligatorily stressed:\n\nHowever, there is a restriction against stress falling on the final syllable of a phrase:\n\nStressed syllables undergo phonetic lengthening in Yupik although the details differ from dialect to dialect. Generally, a foot consisting of light CV syllables will have the stressed vowel at a greater length than the unstressed vowel. That can be analyzed as light syllables changing to heavy under stress:\n\nBoth Central Siberian and Central Alaskan Yup'ik show this iambic lengthening of light syllables.\n\nWhen the stressed syllable is underlyingly heavy (such as \"LHL)\"), there is dialectal variation. The Chaplinski variety of Central Siberian Yupik shows no extra lengthening of the already long vowel: the heavy syllables remain heavy (no change). The St. Lawrence variety of Central Siberian Yupik has further iambic overlengthening, resulting in a change from underlying heavy to a phonetically superheavy syllable (S). In those cases, Central Alaskan Yup'ik changes the first light syllable in what would be a (LH) foot to a heavy syllable which then receives stress. The light to heavy shift is realized as consonant gemination (of the onset) in CV syllables and as consonantal lengthening of the coda in CVC syllables:\n\nNote that in the Chaplinski variety because of iambic lengthening there is a neutralization of vowel length contrast in nonfinal stressed syllables.\n\nThe Yupik languages, like other Eskimo–Aleut languages, represent a particular type of agglutinative language called an \"affixally polysynthetic language\".\n\nYupik languages \"synthesize\" a single root at the beginning of every word with various grammatical suffixes to create long words with sentence-like meanings. Within the vocabulary of Yupik there are no more than two thousand roots and around four hundred lexical suffixes, but they can be combined to create meanings that in most languages are expressed by multiple free morphemes.\n\nAlthough every Yupik word contains \"one and only one root\" that is rigidly constrained to word-initial position, the ordering of the suffixes that follow can be varied to communicate different meanings, principally through recursion. The only exception lies with case suffixes on nouns and person suffixes on verbs, which are restricted to the end of the words in which they occur.\n\nYupik is an ergative language both in nominal and verbal morphology. It has obligatory polyagreement on all verbs with subject and object but not with the theme of a ditransitive verb.\n\nThe Yupik languages were not written until the arrival of Europeans around the beginning of the 19th century. The earliest efforts at writing Yupik were those of missionaries who, with their Yupik-speaking assistants, translated the Bible and other religious texts into Yupik. Such efforts as those of Saint Innocent of Alaska, Reverend John Hinz (see John Henry Kilbuck) and Uyaquk had the limited goals of transmitting religious beliefs in written form.\n\nIn addition to the Alaskan Inupiat, the Alaskan and Siberian Yupik adopted a Latin alphabet originally developed by Moravian missionaries in Greenland beginning in the 1760s, which the missionaries later transported to Labrador. The Alaskans were the only Northern indigenous peoples to develop their own form of picture writing.\n\nAfter the United States purchased Alaska, Yupik children were taught to write English with Latin letters in the public schools. Some were also taught the Yupik script developed by Rev. Hinz, which used Latin letters, which had become the most widespread method for writing Yupik. In Russia, most Yupik were taught to read and write only Russian, but a few scholars wrote Yupik using Cyrillic letters.\n\nIn the 1960s, the University of Alaska assembled a group of scholars and native Yupik speakers,who developed a script to replace the Hinz writing system. One of the goals of this script was that it could be input from an English keyboard without diacriticals or extra letters. Another requirement was that it accurately represent each phoneme in the language with a distinct letter. A few features of the script are that it uses 'q' for the back version of 'k', 'r' for the Yupik sound that resembles the French 'r', and consonant + ' for a geminated (lengthened) consonant. The rhythmic doubling of vowels (except schwa) in every second consecutive open syllable is not indicated in the orthography unless it comes at the end of a word.\n\n"}

The term F-value or \"F\" is defined as the equivalent number of minutes to a certain reference temperature (T) for a certain control microorganism with an established Z-value.\n\nZ-value is a term used in microbial thermal death time calculations. It is the number of degrees the temperature has to be increased to achieve a tenfold (i.e. 1 log) reduction in the D-value. The D-value of an organism is the time required in a given medium, at a given temperature, for a ten-fold reduction in the number of organisms. It is useful when examining the effectiveness of thermal inactivations under different conditions, for example in food cooking and preservation. The z-value is a measure of the change of the D-value with varying temperature, and is a simplified version of an Arrhenius equation and it is equivalent to z=2.303 RT T/E.\n\nThe z-value of an organism in a particular medium is the temperature change required for the D-value to change by a factor of ten, or put another way, the temperature required for the thermal destruction curve to move one log cycle. It is the reciprocal of the slope resulting from the plot of the logarithm of the D-value versus the temperature at which the D-value was obtained. While the D-value gives the time needed at a certain temperature to kill 90% of the organisms, the z-value relates the resistance of an organism to differing temperatures. The z-value allows calculation of the equivalency of two thermal processes, if the D-value and the z-value are known.\n\nExample: if it takes an increase of 10 °F to move the curve one log, then our z-value is 10. Given a D-value of 4.5 minutes at 150 °F, the D-value can be calculated for 160 °F by reducing the time by 1 log. The new D-value for 160 °F given the z-value is 0.45 minutes. This means that each 10 °F increase in temperature will reduce our D-value by 1 log. Conversely, a 10 °F decrease in temperature will increase our D-value by 1 log. So, the D-value for a temperature of 140 °F would be 45 minutes.\na\n"}

Population censuses performed in Austria-Hungary recorded the native language of the citizens, whereby Šokac was declared as native language to one part of the population, presumably members of the Šokci ethnic group. According to the 1910 census, the speakers of Šokac were recorded in the Bačka-Bodrog County, in the municipalities of Apatin, Baja, Odžaci, and Palanka. Although, not very different from Croatian or Serbian Shtokavian speech, Šokac could be identified along with Slavonian subdialect of the \"old-Štokavian\" speech. Today, most of the members of the Šokci community declare themselves as Croats in the census, and their language as Croatian or Serbian.\n\nThe Slavonian subdialect is spoken by Šokci who live in some parts of Slavonia, Bačka, Baranja, Syrmia, in eastern Croatia, northern Serbia (Vojvodina), and Hungary, as well as in northern Bosnia. The Slavonian subdialect has mixed Ikavian and Ekavian pronunciation. Ikavian accent is predominant in the Posavina, Baranja, Bačka, and in the Slavonian enclave of Derventa and \"Orašje\", while Ekavian accent is predominant in Podravina. There are also enclaves of one accent in the territory of the other, as well as mixed Ekavian–Ikavian and Jekavian–Ikavian areas. In some villages in Hungary, the original \"yat\" is preserved. Local variants can widely differ with the degree of neo-Štokavian influence.\n\nThe oldest variant of this dialect persisted in some settlements of Sava river valley between Gradiška and Brod: chiefly in Davor, Orubica, \"Siče\", and \"Magić-Mala\". There the terminal \"l\" e.g. in the verb \"nosil has been retained (instead of modern \"nosio\" = \"carried\"), and \"pepel instead of new \"pepeo\" (ash). The old group \"šć\" is conserved instead of modern \"št\" e.g. \"šćap\" (not modern \"štap\" = stick), and the archaic accents are often \"terminal\" or penultimate, rarely initial in polysyllabic words. In some villages in the Podravina \"čr\" instead of the usual \"cr\" is preserved, for example in old \"črn\" instead of new \"crn\" (\"black\"). All these features are usual in Chakavian and Kajkavian, but rare old-Štokavian dialects also have these features.\n\n"}
