The first philological sign (σημεῖον) invented by the first head of the Alexandrinian Library, Zenodotos of Ephesos, in his edition of Homer has been the Obelos (ὀβελός: -), a short horizontal dash, which Zenodotos used to mark spurious lines. For this reason, the practice of using signs for textual criticism has been called 'Obelism'. Aristophanes of Byzantium invented later the asterisk (ἀστερίσκος: *) to mark lines, that are duplicated from another place as well as the Lunate Sigma (σίγμα: Ϲ) and the antisigma (ἀντίσιγμα: Ͻ) for two consecutive and interchangeable lines of the same content. A system of dots also credited to Aristophanes of Byzantium was developed in the 3rd century BC: a low dot marked an occasion for a short breath after a short phrase, a middot (στιγμή) marked an occasion for a longer breath after a longer passage, and a high dot marked a full stop at the end of a completed thought. Other writers employed two dot punctuation to mark the ends of sentences or changing speakers. Less often, arrangements of three , four and , and five dots appeared. \n\nThe number of the philological signs and in some cases their meanings were modified by Aristarchos of Samothrake (220–143 BC), sixth head of the Alexandrinian Library. He used critical and exegetical signs in his editions of the Homeric poems. A dotted lunate sigma (σίγμα περιεστιγμένον: Ͼ) was used by him as an editorial sign indicating that the line so marked is at an incorrect position. Similarly, an antisigma, or reversed sigma (Ͻ), may mark a line that is out of place. A dotted antisigma or dotted reversed sigma (ἀντίσιγμα περιεστιγμένον: Ͽ) may indicate a line after which rearrangements should be made, or to variant readings of uncertain priority. The Diple marked lines, whose language or content was perhaps also exegetically noteworthy and pointed to a corresponding explanation in a commentary. The diple periestigmene (διπλῆ περιεστιγμένη) a dotted Diple to point to a verse in which Aristarchos' text differs from that of Zenodotos. He used the obelos added to the asteriskos (*-) where the repeated line is out of place and the \"stigme\" (στιγμή: ·) indicated suspected spuriousness.\n\nAristarchos' \"semeia\" became the standard philological signs for centuries to follow, also adopted early on by scholars in Rome. Some papyrus fragments contain un-Aristarchian signs whose use was fairly consistent nevertheless. For instance, the so-called \"ancora\", an anchor-shaped diagonal upward and downward pointer often marks places were text had been omitted or draws attention to text-critical restoration in the top or bottom margin. The Hypodiastole, a curved interpunct was used to disambiguate certain homonyms and showed also that a series of letters should be understood as two separate words. It's companion mark was the enotikon (ἐνωτικόν: ‿) served to show that a series of letters should be read as a single word. The Paragraphos marked a division in a text. The Coronis was used to mark the ends of entire works or major sections in poetic and prose texts.\n\nNine ancient Greek textual annotation symbols are included in the supplemental punctuation list of ISO IEC standard 10646 for character sets. Unicode encodes several more signs.\n\nThe names of the characters Asterix and Obelix in the French comic series \"The Adventures of Asterix\" by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo are derived from the Aristarchian symbols.\n\n"}

At this time the phrase was in use in military slang for a group of recruits who seemed incapable of understanding discipline or not yet sufficiently trained or disciplined to properly carry out their duties.\n\nJohn Clare, an English peasant poet, wrote with his own spelling and no punctuation. He complained in the 1820s to his editors that people could understand him, and he refused to use \"that awkward squad of colon, semi-colon, comma, and full stop\", according to the display in the John Clare Cottage, in Helpston.\n\nIn Canto 7, stanza 52 of Byron's \"Don Juan\", the Russian general Suvorov (or \"Suwarrow\" as Byron anglicizes it) is described training the 'awkward squad' prior to the battle of Ismail.\n\nThomas Babington Macaulay, in his 1842 essay on Frederic the Great, used the phrase to describe the army of Frederic's father.\n\nIn her 1853 novel \"Villette\", Charlotte Brontë writes of M.

The group includes Bob Crow, Mark Serwotka, and Tony Woodley. In a Parliamentary sense, however, it can also apply to the left-wing of the Labour Party, which perennially occupies a bench of the House of Commons which allows its members to heckle and unnerve the Prime Minister regularly.\n\n"}

{"id": "1466696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1466696", "title": "Binding (linguistics)", "text": "Binding (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, binding is the distribution of anaphoric elements (pronouns and other pro-forms). A pronoun (a \"bindee\") usually has an antecedent (a \"binder\") in context. The goal of binding theory is to identify the syntactic relationship that can or must hold between a given pronoun or noun and its antecedent (or postcedent), e.g. \"John said he would help\" vs. \"*He said John would help\" (the second sentence is not possible if \"he\" is intended to mean \"John\"). \n\nThe idea that there should be a specialized, coherent theory dealing with this sort of phenomena originated in work in transformational grammar in the 1970s. This work culminated in government and binding theory in the 1980s. The binding theory that became established at that time is still considered a reference point, though its validity is no longer accepted. \n\nMany theories of syntax now have a subtheory that addresses binding phenomena. These phenomena exist in all languages, although the behavior of binding can vary in interesting and nuanced ways across languages, even across languages that are closely related.\n\nThe following sentences illustrate some basic facts of binding. The words that bear the index i should be construed as referring to the same person or thing.\n\nThese sentences illustrate some aspects of the distribution of reflexive and personal pronouns. In the first pair of sentences, the reflexive pronoun must appear for the indicated reading to be possible. In the second pair, the personal pronoun must appear for the indicated reading to be possible. The third pair shows that at times a personal pronoun must follow its antecedent, and the fourth pair further illustrates the same point, although the acceptability judgement is not as robust. Based on such data, one sees that reflexive and personal pronouns differ in their distribution and that linear order (of a pronoun in relation to its antecedent or postcedent) is a factor influencing where at least some pronouns can appear. A theory of binding should be in a position to predict and explain the differences in distribution seen in sentences like these. It should be in a position to answer questions like: What explains where a reflexive pronoun must appear as opposed to a personal pronoun? When does linear order play a role in determining where pronouns can appear? What other factor (or factors) beyond linear order help predict where pronouns can appear?\n\nThe following three subsections consider the binding domains that are relevant for the distribution of pronouns and nouns. The discussion follows the outline provided by the traditional binding theory (see below), which divides nominals into three basic categories: reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, personal pronouns, and nouns (common and proper).\n\nWhen one examines the distribution of reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, one sees that there are certain domains that are relevant, a \"domain\" being a syntactic unit that is clause-like. Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns often seek their antecedent close by, in a binding domain that is local, e.g.\n\nThese examples illustrate that there is a domain within which a reflexive or reciprocal pronoun should find its antecedent. The a-sentences are fine because the reflexive or reciprocal pronoun has its antecedent within the clause. The b-sentences, in contrast, do not allow the indicated reading, a fact illustrating that personal pronouns have a distribution that is different from that of reflexive and reciprocal pronouns. A related observation is that a reflexive and reciprocal pronoun often cannot seek its antecedent in a superordinate clause, e.g.\n\nWhen the reflexive or reciprocal pronoun attempts to find an antecedent outside of the immediate clause containing it, it fails. In other words, it can hardly seek its antecedent in the superordinate clause. The binding domain that is relevant is the immediate clause containing it.\n\nPersonal pronouns have a distribution that is different from reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, a point that is evident with the first two b-sentences in the previous section. The local binding domain that is decisive for the distribution of reflexive and reciprocal pronouns is also decisive for personal pronouns, but in a different way. Personal pronouns seek their antecedent outside of the local binding domain containing them, e.g.\n\nIn these cases, the pronoun has to look outside of the embedded clause containing it to the matrix clause to find its antecedent. Hence based on such data, the relevant binding domain appears to be the clause. Further data illustrate, however, that the clause is actually not the relevant domain:\n\nSince the pronouns appear within the same minimal clause containing their antecedents in these cases, one cannot argue that the relevant binding domain is the clause. The most one can say based on such data is that the domain is \"clause-like\".\n\nThe distribution of common and proper nouns is unlike that of reflexive, reciprocal, and personal pronouns. The relevant observation in this regard is that a noun is often reluctantly coreferential with another nominal that is within its binding domain or in a superordinate binding domain, e.g.\n\nThe readings indicated in the a-sentences are natural, whereas the b-sentences are very unusual. Indeed, sentences like these b-sentences were judged to be impossible in the traditional binding theory according to Condition C (see below). Given a contrastive context, however, the b-sentences can work, e.g. \"Susan does not admire Jane, but rather Susan admires Susan\". One can therefore conclude that nouns are not sensitive to binding domains in the same way that reflexive, reciprocal, and personal pronouns are.\n\nThe following subsections illustrate the extent to which pure linear order impacts the distribution of pronouns. While linear order is clearly important, it is not the only factor influencing where pronouns can appear.\n\nA simple hypothesis concerning the distribution of many anaphoric elements, of personal pronouns in particular, is that linear order plays a role. In most cases, a pronoun follows its antecedent, and in many cases, the coreferential reading is impossible if the pronoun precedes its antecedent. The following sentences suggest that pure linear can indeed be important for the distribution of pronouns:\n\nWhile the coreferential readings indicated in these b-sentences are possible, they are unlikely. The order presented in the a-sentences is strongly preferred. The following, more extensive data sets further illustrate that linear order is important:\n\nWhile the acceptability judgements here are nuanced, one can make a strong case that pure linear order is at least in part predictive of when the indicated reading is available. The a- and c-sentences allow the coreferential reading more easily than their b- and d-counterparts.\n\nWhile linear order is an important factor influencing the distribution of pronouns, it is not the only factor. The following sentences are similar to the c- and d-sentences in the previous section insofar as an embedded clause is present.\n\nWhile there may be a mild preference for the order in the a-sentences here, the indicated reading in the b-sentences is also available. Hence linear order is hardly playing a role in such cases. The relevant difference between these sentences and the c- and d-sentences in the previous section is that the embedded clauses here are adjunct clauses, whereas they are argument clauses above. The following examples involve adjunct phrases:\n\nThe fact that the c-sentences marginally allow the indicated reading whereas the b-sentences do not at all allow this reading further demonstrates that linear order is important. But in this regard, the d-sentences are telling, since if linear order were the entire story, one would expect the d-sentences to be less acceptable than they are. The conclusion that one can draw from such data is that there are one or more other factors beyond linear order that are impacting the distribution of pronouns.\n\nGiven that linear order is not the only factor influencing the distribution of pronouns, the question is what other factor or factors might also be playing a role. The traditional binding theory (see below) took c-command to be the all important factor, but the importance of c-command for syntactic theorizing has been extensively criticized in recent years. The primary alternative to c-command is functional rank. These two competing concepts (c-command vs. rank) have been debated extensively and they continue to be debated. C-command is a configurational notion; it is defined over concrete syntactic configurations. Syntactic rank, in contrast, is a functional notion that resides in the lexicon; it is defined over the ranking of the arguments of predicates. Subjects are ranked higher than objects, first objects are ranked higher than second objects, and prepositional objects are ranked lowest. The following two subsections briefly consider these competing notions.\n\nC-command is a configurational notion that acknowledges the syntactic configuration as primitive. Basic subject-object asymmetries, which are numerous in many languages, are explained by the fact that the subject appears outside of the finite verb phrase (VP) constituent, whereas the object appears inside it. Subjects therefore c-command objects, but not vice versa. C-command is defined as follows:\n\nGiven the binary division of the clause (S → NP + VP) associated with most phrase structure grammars, this definition sees a typical subject c-commanding everything inside the verb phrase (VP), whereas everything inside the VP is incapable of c-commanding anything outside of the VP. Some basic binding facts are explained in this manner, e.g.\n\nSentence a is fine because the subject \"Larry\" c-commands the object \"himself\", whereas sentence b does not work because the object \"Larry\" does not c-command the subject \"himself\". The assumption has been that within its binding domain, a reflexive pronoun must be c-commanded by its antecedent. While this approach based on c-command makes a correct prediction much of the time, there are other cases where it fails to make the correct prediction, e.g.\n\nThe reading indicated is acceptable in this case, but if c-command were the key notion helping to explain where the reflexive can and must appear, then the reading should be impossible since \"himself\" is not c-commanded by \"Larry\".\n\nAs reflexive and personal pronouns occur in complementary distribution, the notion of c-command can also be used to explain where personal pronouns can appear. The assumption is that personal pronouns \"cannot\" c-command their antecedent, e.g.\n\nIn both examples, the personal pronoun \"she\" does not c-command its antecedent \"Alice\", resulting in the grammaticality of both sentences despite reversed linear order.\n\nThe alternative to a c-command approach posits a ranking of syntactic functions (SUBJECT > FIRST OBJECT > SECOND OBJECT > PREPOSITIONAL OBJECT). Subject-object asymmetries are addressed in terms of this ranking. Since subjects are ranked higher than objects, an object can have the subject as its antecedent, but not vice versa. With basic cases, this approach makes the same prediction as the c-command approach. The first two sentences from the previous section are repeated here:\n\nSince the subject outranks the object, sentence a is predictably acceptable, the subject \"Larry\" outranking the object \"himself\". Sentence b, in contrast, is bad because the subject reflexive pronoun \"himself\" outranks its postcedent \"Larry\". In other words, this approach in terms of rank is assuming that within its binding domain, a reflexive pronoun may not outrank its antecedent (or postcedent). Consider the third example sentence from the previous section in this regard:\n\nThe approach based on rank does not require a particular configurational relationship to hold between a reflexive pronoun and its antecedent. In other words, it makes no prediction in this case, and hence does not make an incorrect prediction. The reflexive pronoun \"himself\" is embedded within the subject noun phrase, which means that it is not the subject and hence does not outrank the object \"Larry\".\n\nA theory of binding that acknowledges both linear order and rank can at least begin to predict many of the marginal readings. When both linear order and rank combine, acceptability judgments are robust, e.g.\n\nThis ability to address marginal readings is something that an approach combining linear order and rank can accomplish, whereas an approach that acknowledges only c-command cannot do the same.\n\nThe exploration of binding phenomena got started in the 1970s and interest peaked in the 1980s with Government and Binding Theory, a grammar framework in the tradition of generative syntax that is still prominent today. The theory of binding that became widespread at that time serves now merely as reference point (since it is no longer believed to be correct). This theory distinguishes between 3 different binding conditions: A, B, and C. The theory classifies nominals according to two features, [±anaphor] and [±pronominal], which are binary. The binding characteristics of a nominal are determined by the values of these features, either plus or minus. Thus, a nominal that is [-anaphor, -pronominal] is an R-expression (referring expression), such as a common noun or a proper name. A nominal that is [-anaphor, +pronominal] is a pronoun, such \"he\" or \"they\", and a nominal that is [+anaphor, -pronominal] is a reflexive pronoun, such as \"himself\" or \"themselves\". Note that the term \"anaphor\" here is being used in a specialized sense; it essentially means \"reflexive\". This meaning is specific to the Government and Binding framework and has not spread beyond this framework.\n\nBased on the classifications according to these two features, three conditions are formulated:\n\nWhile the theory of binding that these three conditions represent is no longer held to be valid, as mentioned above, the associations with the three conditions are so firmly anchored in the study of binding that one often refers to, for example, \"Condition A effects\" or \"Condition B effects\" when describing binding phenomena.\n\n"}

Bulgarian dialectology dates to the 1830s and the pioneering work of Neofit Rilski, \"Bolgarska gramatika\" (published 1835 in Kragujevac, Serbia, then Ottoman Empire). Other notable researchers in this field include Marin Drinov, Konstantin Josef Jireček, Lyubomir Miletich, Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan, Stoyko Stoykov.\n\nThe dialects of Macedonian were for the most part classified as part of Bulgarian in the older literature. The Bulgarian linguistics continue to treat it as such in.\nSince the second half of the 20th century, foreign authors have mostly adopted the convention of treating these in terms of a separate Macedonian language, following the codification of Macedonian as the literary standard language of Yugoslav Macedonia. However, some contemporary linguists still consider Macedonian as a dialect of Bulgarian. Macedonian authors in turn tend to treat all dialects spoken in the geographical region of Macedonia as Macedonian, including those spoken in Bulgarian Macedonia. Together with their closest lexical and grammatical relative they comprise the Eastern South Slavic branch. The present article treats all these dialects together, because of their close structural similarity and the fact that many important dialect boundaries intersect both territories.\n\nThe Bulgar nation absorbed diverse Slavic tribes and not a particular language. The main isogloss separating the Bulgarian dialects into Eastern and Western is the yat border, marking the different mutations of the Old Bulgarian yat form (ѣ, *\"ě\"), pronounced as either /ʲa/ or /ɛ/ to the east (\"byal\", but plural \"beli\" in Balkan dialects, \"white\") and strictly as /ɛ/ to the west of it (\"bel\", plural \"beli\") throughout former Yugoslavia. Isoglosses shape three groups. Besides the Eastern and Western dialects, the Rup group of dialects is distinct, which comrpises the Rhodopes and everything southwards from Thessaloniki to Istanbul, although it is an Eastern dialect. The official language derives most often from the northeastern group of dialects nominally based on Veliko Tarnovo dialect. Many Western South Slavic lexical, morphological and phonological isoglosses are present in all Western Bulgarian dialects and rarer in Rup dialects, which peak in Torlakian. Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian dialects share characteristics far beyond the Torlakian area and beyond the contested territories of the medieval Bulgarian and Serbian states, which are west of Sofia. So, these political entities are not responsible for the transitional features, but they are basically rooted in other type of evolution, likely in a makeup in the contact area of the two sources of Eastern and Western South Slavic tribes. The transitional dialect from Tran shares more similarities with Serbo-Croatian than with Bulgarian. The makeup of the transitional area shows a mix of Eastern and Western South Slavic characteristics found in western Bulgaria, which contact happened in the Balkans assuming the exact location of this area. All isoglosses commonly share gradual borders deep inside the country, but the northeast always don't, which likely means that the contact zone mixed after the settling of the Slavs in the Balkans. In one instance both \"a\" and \"ъ\" for nasal yus are part of Elin Pelin dialect. Probably one of the words that remain the same on one of the largest areas in Bulgaria is that for night \"nosht\", which is at best rare in other Slavic languages, in which along with the Torlaks in Bulgaria \"noch\" means night.\n\nThe same diversity of phonetic characteristics of the nosal big yus (*ǫ) isoglosses as a root of the words \"zab maž, pat, bachva\", etc. featuring other vowels than \"u\" or \"o\", are likely documented only in Eastern South Slavic and Lechitic dialects. The official pronunciation of \"a\" was used in Medieval Polish and is now Kashubian. The modern official Polish this is still inscribed with \"a\", but pronounced in number of varieties such as \"om\" as preserved in the Kostur dialect or \"e\" as in Varna dialect. Present and medieval Lechitic dialects are also likely the only documented speech that would match analogously with the ending of the standard Bulgarian verbs in first person in present tense with yus endings \"am\" or \"a\" in singular form (1st conj.- \"cheta\" \"I read\"; 2 conj.- \"slusham\" \"I listen\") or in plural form (1st conj.- \"chetem\" \"we read\"; 2nd conj.- \"slushame\" \"we listen\"). In eastern Bulgarian dialects in contrast with the other South Slavic languages, standard Ukrainian and Czech, the unstressed vowel \"e\" by palatalization turns into \"i\" or \"ie\". The Bulgarian pronouns in third person \"toy, te\" are documented in Ukrainian dialects.\n\nBulgarian dialects can be divided into the following dialectal groups and individual dialects:\n\n\n"}

It deals with the phonology and phonetics of Egyptian Arabic as well as the phonological development of child native speakers of the dialect. To varying degrees, it affects the pronunciation of Literary Arabic by native Egyptian Arabic speakers, as is the case for speakers of all other varieties of Arabic.\n\nTraditionally, the interdental consonants correspond to the Egyptian Arabic alveolar consonants . This is a feature common to some North African Arabic varieties and is attested in \"pre-modern\" words:\n\nHowever, unlike other North African varieties, in Egyptian Arabic, the Literary Arabic interdental consonants may correspond to sibilant consonants .\n\n\nClassical Arabic reflex ' is realized as velar in Cairene Egypt in the same way as it is in some southern Arabic dialects in Yemen. Thus, ' , ('mountain'), is pronounced, even in Literary Arabic as rather than .\n\nOther consonants are more marginal. In addition to appearing in native words, also appears in loanwords from European languages, such as ('parachute'), and native words with guttural vowels, such as ('my cows') vs ('cowlike'). Labial emphatics and also come from loanwords; minimal pairs include ('patriarch') vs ('Paopi'). Classical Arabic * became in Cairo (a feature shared with Lebanese and other forms of Levantine Arabic), but is retained natively in some dialects to the west of the Nile Delta, outside of Alexandria, and has been reintroduced as a marginal phoneme from Standard Arabic, particularly relating to certain religious words and those deriving from the root \"\"-\"\"-\"\", relating to culture.. In mildly careful speech, is used to distinguish between words that would otherwise be identical. For example, may be either ('law') or ('kanun'); may be either ('strong') or ('very'), although could be used for both meanings). , , and also appear in loanwords, such as ('jacket').\n\n\n\nFor some speakers, there is a voicing and devoicing assimilation for the following consonants:\nWhen the input consonants differ only in voicing, the resultant assimilation will be complete.\n\nThe Egyptian Arabic vocalic system has changed from the Classical system. The system of vowels is as follows:\n\nLike Maghrebi Arabic dialects, the higher vowels tend to be more centralized in emphatic environment:\n\nThe Classical Arabic phonemes and are in the process of splitting into two phonemes each, resulting in the four Egyptian Arabic phonemes . The front and back variants alternate in verbal and nominal paradigms in ways that are largely predictable, but the back variants occur unpredictably in some lexical stems, especially those of European-language origin. This is discussed more below.\n\nVowels and are often regarded as allophones of the vowels and respectively instead of constituting separate vowel phonemes; so they cannot form minimal pairs. For further discussion regarding vowel allophony in Egyptian Arabic, see .\n\nEgyptian Arabic maintains in all positions the early post-Classical distinctions between short and . Contrast, for example, Levantine Arabic dialects, which merge and into in most positions, and Moroccan Arabic, which merges and into in all positions. In particular, note the different shapes and vowel distinctions between ('book') and ('beautiful' pl.) vs. ('camels') and ('he chose'); in most Levantine dialects, all the short vowels in these words are elided, leading to the identical shapes , , .\n\nAn epenthetic vowel is automatically inserted after the second of three or more consonants in a cluster to break up such clusters. The epenthetic vowel is , the same as , but it remains even when surfaces as , leading to minimal pairs:\n\nMany spoken Arabic varieties have developed two allophones of the Classical Arabic vowels and , with fronted allophones occurring in most circumstances, but backed allophones occurring in the vicinity of emphatic consonants. This process is known as emphasis spreading. The exact criteria of both \"vicinity\" and \"emphatic consonant\" varies depending on the individual speech variety. In Egyptian Arabic, the occurrence of is no longer completely predictable, suggesting that these sounds have become phonemicized; but see below for more discussion.\n\nIn Egyptian Arabic, the consonants that trigger emphasis spreading include the pharyngealized consonants , the , and some instances of (see below). On the other hand, the pharyngeal consonants do \"not\" trigger emphasis spreading; in the standard Cairene dialect, the fricatives also do not, although this is different in many Saidi dialects in which they are .\n\nIn general, when emphasis spreading is triggered, the back variants spread both forward and backward throughout the phonological word, including any morphological prefixes, suffixes and clitics. Note that this is different from many other Arabic varieties. For example, in Moroccan Arabic, emphasis spreading usually travels no farther than the first full vowel on either side of the triggering consonant, and in many varieties of Levantine Arabic, emphasis spreading is of indefinite extent but is blocked by the phonemes . Nevertheless, emphasis spreading is not completely reliable, and there is some free variation, especially in the pronunciation of prefixes and suffixes at some distance from the triggering consonant.\n\nSome instances of trigger emphasis spreading, while others do not. Originally, an adjacent to was considered non-emphatic, while others were emphatic and triggered emphasis spreading. Currently, however, this is no more than a rough guideline, as many exceptions have since developed. This situation has led many linguists to postulate the existence of two phonemes , which both surface as but where only triggers emphasis spreading. This analysis is not completely ideal in that these two resulting \"phonemes\" alternate to a large extent (often unpredictably) in related forms derived from the same root.\n\nCurrently, to the extent that the emphatic or non-emphatic variant of /r/ can be predicted, it works as follows: If is adjacent to a vowel , emphasis-spreading is inhibited; otherwise, it occurs. The is able to \"see across\" derivational but not inflectional morphemes. As an example, ('commerce') and ('you grow' masc.) both have emphasis spreading, since occurs adjacent to low but not adjacent to any non-low front vowel. On the other hand, of the derived forms ('commercial') and ('you grow' fem.), only the latter has emphasis spreading. In this case, the derivational suffix ('related to') creates a new lexical item in the language's vocabulary, and hence the stem is reevaluated for emphasis, with the non-low front vowel triggering non-emphatic ; but the inflectional suffix marking feminine singular does not create a new lexical item, and as a result the emphasis in the stem remains. (For these purposes, past and non-past forms of a verb are considered separate stems; hence alternations can occur like 'he continued' vs. 'he continues'.)\n\nAn emphasis-spreading is usually adjacent to a low vowel (which in turn is backed to ), but that is not necessary, and also triggers emphasis-spreading: Examples ('famous') → , ('project') → , ('thin') → .\n\nThe alternation between and is almost completely predictable in verbal and nominal paradigms, as well as in the large majority of words derived from Classical Arabic. It is also irrelevant for the operation of the numerous phonological adjustment rules (e.g. vowel lengthening, shortening and elision) in Egyptian Arabic. As a result, linguistic descriptions tend to subsume both under an archiphoneme . On the other hand, there are a number of lexical items in which \"autonomous\" tend to occur irrespective of the presence of emphatic consonants. A few are in Arabic-derived words, e.g. ('water'), but the majority are in words of foreign origin — especially those derived from European languages — where echo the vowel quality of in those languages.\n\nDifferent authors have proposed differing phonemic analyses of this situation:\nThe approach followed here is to ignore the distinction in phonemic descriptions, subsuming as allophones of , but where necessary to also include a phonetic explication (i.e. detailed pronunciation) that indicates the exact quality of all vowels. Generally, these phonetic explications are given for the examples in the section on phonology, and elsewhere whenever autonomous occurs.\n\nAll long vowels are shortened when followed by two consonants (including geminated consonants), and also in unstressed syllables, though they are but sometimes kept long in careful speech pronunciations of loanwords, as in ('Cairo') and a few other borrowings from Classical Arabic with similar shapes, such as ('phenomenon'). Long vowel , when shortened collapse with which are, as well, the shortened form of ; as a result, The following three words are only distinguished contextually:\n\nFinal short vowels are lengthened when the stress is brought forward onto them as a result of the addition of a suffix.\n\nUnstressed and are deleted (i.e. syncope) when occurring in the context /VCVCV/, i.e. in an internal syllable with a single consonant on both sides. This also applies across word boundaries in cases of close syntactic connection.\n\nThree or more consonants are never allowed to appear together, including across a word boundary. When such a situation would occur, an epenthetic is inserted between the second and third consonants.\n\nUnlike in most Arabic dialects, Egyptian Arabic has many words that logically begin with a vowel (e.g. 'I'), in addition to words that logically begin with a glottal stop (e.g. 'very', from Classical 'strong'). When pronounced in isolation, both types of words will be sounded with an initial glottal stop. However, when following another word, words beginning with a vowel will often follow smoothly after the previous word, while words beginning with a glottal stop will always have the glottal stop sounded, e.g.:\n\nThe phonetic pronunciations indicated above also demonstrate the phenomenon of \"linking\", a normal process in Egyptian Arabic where syllable boundaries are adjusted across word boundaries to ensure that every syllable begins with exactly one consonant.\n\nElision of vowels often occurs across word boundaries when a word ending with a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, especially when the two vowels are the same, or when one is .\nMore specifically, elision occurs in the following circumstances:\n\nMultiple processes often apply simultaneously. An example of both insertion and deletion working together comes from the phrase ('the girl is grown up'):\nExample of insertion and deletion together:\nCompare ('the boy is grown up'), where neither process applies.\n\nSimilarly, an example of both deletion and long-vowel shortening appears in the phrase ('friend' fem.):\nCompare with Classical Arabic .\n\nThe operation of the various processes can often produce ambiguity:\nHence, is ambiguous in regards to grammatical gender.\n\nEgyptian Arabic has the following five syllable types: CV, CVː, CVC, CVːC, and CVCC.\n\nCVː, CVːC, and CVCC are long, or heavy, syllables. Long syllables bear primary stress, and there is only one stressed syllable per word.\nEgyptian Arabic has a strong preference for heavy syllables, and various phonetic adjustments conspire to modify the surface pronunciation of connected speech towards the ideal of consisting entirely of heavy syllables. Examples can be seen below:\n\nAn example of these various processes together:\nIn the following and similar analyses, the normal-form pronunciation is given as the phonetic equivalent of the given phonemic form, although the intermediate steps may be given if necessary for clarity.\n\nOther examples include ('I want to eat') → , ('I want to eat it') → , and ('They want to eat it') → .\n\nThe position of stress is essentially automatic. The basic rule is that, preceding from right to left in a word (from the end to the beginning of the word), the stress goes on the first encountered syllable of any of these types:\n\n1. A heavy syllable: that is, a syllable ending in either a long vowel (CVː) or one or two consonants (CVC, CVCC)\n\n2. A non-final light syllable that directly follows a heavy syllable\n\n3. A non-final light syllable that directly follows two light syllables (i.e. ...CVCVˈCVCV...)\n\n4. The first syllable of the word\n\nBecause the stress is almost completely predictable, it is not indicated in phonemic transcriptions (but \"is\" given in the corresponding phonetic explication).\n\n identifies three stages in the phonological acquisition of Egyptian Arabic, ending with completion of the consonant inventory (with the possible exception of ) at approximately age five.\n\nThe sound inventory found in the babbling stage does not technically consist of phonemes, but rather vowel- and consonant-\"like\" sounds. Therefore, they are not true speech sounds. Like children acquiring other world languages, Egyptian Arabic infants produce consonant-like sounds approximating , , , , , , , , , .\n\nAt this stage children have acquired the basic , , vowel triangle, and the consonants , , , , and . At this stage is only produced word-initially (possibly due to speakers’ tendency to insert a glottal stop on words which begin with a vowel). There is typically no voiced-voiceless contrast and no single-double consonant contrast.\n\nNewly acquired phonemes are: , , , , , , , , , , , , , . A voiced-voiceless contrast is now apparent in stops and fricatives. Consonant clusters appear but are unstable, often being omitted or simplified (consonant cluster reduction). The newly acquired lateral is frequently used in place of the tap/trill ~ (lateralization). Example: ('school') → \n\nVowel length distinction, the emphatics , , , ;   (sometimes realized as ) and (often realized as ) are acquired. A geminated consonant distinction is developing, although children have difficulty with and its voiced pair .\n\nThe tap/trill ~ and all diphthongs and clusters are acquired, and geminate consonant distinction is stable. The phoneme is rare in Egyptian Arabic and is typically only mastered with formal schooling at around age seven or eight, and is realized acceptably in the dialect as .\n\nEgyptian Arabic phoneme acquisition has been chiefly compared to that of English. The order of phoneme acquisition is similar for both languages: Exceptions are , , and , which appear earlier in Arabic-speaking children's inventory than in English, perhaps due to the frequency of their occurrence in the children's input. Egyptian Arabic differs most from English in terms of age of phoneme acquisition: Vowel distinctions appear at an earlier age in Egyptian Arabic than in English, which could reflect both the smaller inventory and the higher functional value of Arabic vowels: The consonantal system, on the other hand, is completed almost a year later than that of English. However, the lateral is acquired by most Arabic-speaking children by age two, a year earlier than English-speaking children. The most difficult phonemes for young Arabic children are emphatic stops, fricatives, and the tap/trill ~.   and , which are relatively rare sounds in other languages, are the most difficult geminate consonants to acquire.\n\nFor children under two, syllable reduction and final consonant deletion are the most common phonological processes. De-emphasis, involving the loss of the secondary articulation for emphatic consonants (e.g., realizing emphatic as ), may reflect the motoric difficulty of emphatic consonants, which are rare in world languages, as well as their relatively low frequency and functional load in Arabic.\n\nThe back fricatives and are unusually accurate at an early age and less prone to fronting than in other languages.\n\nMost children have mastered all syllable types between the ages of two and three. A preference for three-syllable words is evident (CVːC syllables being the most frequently produced) and production rarely exceeds four syllables. Simplification processes like those detailed above may occur to reduce CVCC syllables to CVːC or CVC syllables; however, when children change the syllable structure, they preserve the prosodic weight of the altered syllable in order to maintain stress relations.\n\n"}

Nearly every county has its own distinct dialect unintelligible to a speaker from a few counties away. For this reason, bilingualism and multilingualism are common among speakers of Hui. It is estimated that there are around 4.6 million speakers of Huizhou varieties.\n\nHuizhou Chinese was originally classified as Lower Yangtze Mandarin but it is currently classified separately from it.\nThe Chinese Academy of Social Sciences supported the separation of Huizhou from Lower Yangtze Mandarin in 1987. Its classification is disputed, with some linguists such as Matisoff classifying it as Wu Chinese, others such as Bradley (2007) as Gan, and still others setting it apart as a primary branch of Chinese.\n\nIn the Ming and Qing dynasties Jianghuai speakers moved into Hui dialect areas.\n\nSome works of literature produced in Yangzhou, such as \"Qingfengzha\", a novel, contain Jianghuai Mandarin. People in Yangzhou identified by the dialect they speak, locals spoke the dialect, as opposed to sojourners, who spoke other varieties like Huizhou or Wu. This led to the formation of identity based on dialect. Large numbers of merchants from Huizhou lived in Yangzhou and effectively were responsible for keeping the town afloat.

{"id": "1265105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1265105", "title": "Human security", "text": "Human security\n\nHuman security is an emerging paradigm for understanding global vulnerabilities whose proponents challenge the traditional notion of national security by arguing that the proper referent for security should be at the human rather than national level. Human security reveals a people-centred and multi-disciplinary understanding of security involves a number of research fields, including development studies, international relations, strategic studies, and human rights. The United Nations Development Programme's 1994 Human Development Report is considered a milestone publication in the field of human security, with its argument that insuring \"freedom from want\" and \"freedom from fear\" for all persons is the best path to tackle the problem of global insecurity.\n\nCritics of the concept argue that its vagueness undermines its effectiveness, that it has become little more than a vehicle for activists wishing to promote certain causes, and that it does not help the research community understand what security means or help decision makers to formulate good policies. Alternatively, other scholars have argued that the concept of human security should be broadened to encompass military security: 'In other words, if this thing called ‘human security’ has the concept of ‘the human’ embedded at the heart of it, then let us address the question of the human condition directly. Thus understood, human security would no longer be the vague amorphous add-on to harder edged areas of security such as military security or state security.'\n\nIn order for human security to challenge global inequalities, there has to be cooperation between a country’s foreign policy and its approach to global health. However, the interest of the state has continued to overshadow the interest of the people. For instance, Canada's foreign policy, \"three Ds\", has been criticized for emphasizing defense more than development.\n\nThe emergence of the human security discourse was the product of a convergence of factors at the end of the Cold War. These challenged the dominance of the neorealist paradigm’s focus on states, “mutually assured destruction” and military security and briefly enabled a broader concept of security to emerge. The increasingly rapid pace of globalisation; the failure of liberal state building through the instruments of the Washington Consensus; the reduced threat of nuclear war between the superpowers, the exponential rise in the spread and consolidation of democratisation and international human rights norms opened a space in which both ‘development’ and concepts of ‘security’ could be reconsidered.\n\nAt the same time the increasing number of internal violent conflicts in Africa, Asia and Europe (Balkans) resulted in concepts of national and international security failing to reflect the challenges of the post Cold War security environment whilst the failure of neoliberal development models to generate growth, particularly in Africa, or to deal with the consequences of complex new threats (such as HIV and climate change) reinforced the sense that international institutions and states were not organised to address such problems in an integrated way.\n\nThe principal possible indicators of movement toward an individualized conception of security lie in the first place in the evolution of international society's consideration of rights of individuals in the face of potential threats from states. The most obvious foci of analysis here are the UN Charter, the UN Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and its associated covenants (1966), and conventions related to particular crimes (e.g.,genocide) and the rights of particular groups (e.g., women, racial groups, and refugees).\n\nMahbub ul Haq first drew global attention to the concept of human security in the United Nations Development Programme's 1994 \"Human Development Report\" and sought to influence the UN's 1995 World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen. The UNDP's 1994 Human Development Report's definition of human security argues that the scope of global security should be expanded to include \"threats in seven areas\":\n\nSince then, human security has been receiving more attention from the key global development institutions, such as the World Bank. Tadjbakhsh, among others, traces the evolution of human security in international organizations, concluding that the concept has been manipulated and transformed considerably since 1994 to fit organizational interests.\n\nIn an ideal world, each of the UNDP's seven categories of threats (and perhaps others as a broader discussion might prioritize) would receive adequate global attention and resources. Yet attempts to implement this human security agenda have led to the emergence of two major schools of thought on how to best practice human security – '\"Freedom from Fear\"' and '\"Freedom from Want\"'. While the UNDP 1994 report originally argued that human security requires attention to both \"freedom from fear\" and \"freedom from want,\" divisions have gradually emerged over the proper scope of that protection (e.g. over what individuals should be protected from) and over the appropriate mechanisms for responding to these threats.\n\n\nDespite their differences, these two approaches to human security can be considered complementary rather than contradictory. Expressions to this effect include:\n\n\nAlthough \"freedom from fear\" and \"freedom from want\" are the most commonly referred to categories of human security practice, an increasing number of alternative ideas continue to emerge on how to best practice human security. Among them:\n\nCoined in the early 1990s, the term human security has been used by thinkers who have sought to shift the discourse on security away from its traditional state-centered orientation to the protection and advancement of individuals within societies. Human security emerged as a challenge to ideas of traditional security, but human and traditional or national security are not mutually exclusive concepts. It has been argued that, without human security, traditional state security cannot be attained and vice versa.\nTraditional security is about a state's ability to defend itself against external threats. Traditional security (often referred to as national security or state security) describes the philosophy of international security predominance since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 and the rise of the nation-states. While international relations theory includes many variants of traditional security, from realism to liberalism, the fundamental trait that these schools share is their focus on the primacy of the nation-state.\n\nThe following table contrasts four differences between the two perspectives:\n\nHuman security also challenged and drew from the practice of international development.\n\nTraditionally, embracing liberal market economics was considered to be the universal path for economic growth, and thus development for all humanity. Yet, continuing conflict and human rights abuses following the end of the Cold War and the fact that two-thirds of the global population seemed to have gained little from the economic gains of globalization, led to fundamental questions about the way development was practiced. Accordingly, human development has emerged in the 1990s to challenge the dominant paradigm of liberal economy in the development community. Human development proponents argue that economic growth is insufficient to expand people’s choice or capabilities, areas such as health, education, technology, the environment, and employment should not be neglected.\n\nHuman security could be said to further enlarge the scope for examining the causes and consequences of underdevelopment, by seeking to bridge the divide between development and security. Too often, militaries didn’t address or factor in the underlying causes of violence and insecurity while development workers often underplayed the vulnerability of development models to violent conflict . Human security springs from a growing consensus that these two fields need to be more fully integrated in order to enhance security for all.\n\nThe paper \"Development and Security\" by Frances Stewart argues that security and development are deeply interconnected.\n\nFurther, it could also be said that the practice of human development and human security share three fundamental elements:\n\n\nDespite these similarities, the relationship with development is one of the most contested areas of human security . \"Freedom from fear\" advocates, such as Andrew Mack, argue that human security should focus on the achievable goals of decreasing individual vulnerability to violent conflict, rather than broadly defined goals of economic and social development. Others, such as Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, argue that human development and human security are inextricably linked since progress in one enhances the chances of progress in another while failure in one increases risk of failure of another.\n\nThe following table is adopted from Tadjbakhsh to help clarify the relationship between these two concepts.\n\nHuman security is indebted to the human rights tradition (the ideas of natural law and natural rights). The development of the human security model can be seen to have drawn upon ideas and concepts fundamental to the human rights tradition. Both approaches use the individual as the main referent and both argue that a wide range of issues (i.e. civil rights, cultural identity, access to education and healthcare) are fundamental to human dignity. A major difference between the two models is in their approach to addressing threats to human dignity and survival. Whilst the human rights framework takes a legalistic approach, the human security framework, by utilizing a diverse range of actors, adopts flexible and issue-specific approaches, which can operate at local, national or international levels.\n\nThe nature of the relationship between human security and human rights is contested among human security advocates. Some human security advocates argue that the goal of human security should be to build upon and strengthen the existing global human rights legal framework. However, other advocates view the human rights legal framework as part of the global insecurity problem and believe that a human security approach should propel us to move above and beyond this legalistic approach to get at the underlying sources of inequality and violence which are the root causes of insecurity in today's world.\n\nSee also: Non-governmental organization\n\nThe term NGO (Non Government Organisation) cannot be simply defined due to complexities surrounding its structure, environment and complex relations it shares with its internal factions; being its organisational mission, membership and sources of funding, and external factors such as the relationship it shares with actors; detailing the economic, political and societal constructs they may be bound by. A generic understanding of the term may refer to the actions taken in the interests of independent, voluntary contributors which exist independently from governments and corporations, designed to represent and provide a collective voice to individuals regarding issues. These issues cover contributions to the fields and industries of human development, health and nutrition, human rights and education, and environmental concerns; all of which influence and affect human security.\n\nThe traditional roles of NGOs may be classified into three components, in accordance with Lewis:\n\n- Implementer: refers to the mobilisation of resources in order to aid the provision of goods and services, such as the act of service delivery.\n\n- Catalyst: refers to the emotional and psychological aspect of the NGOs ability to inspire, facilitate or contribute to spur action or thinking.\n\n- Partner: refers to the NGOs relationships shared with external actors such as governments, donors or the private sector players through joint activities, or projects with communities, with the purpose to strengthen the relationship between the NGOs and these partners in a mutually beneficial fashion.\n\nThe expansion of these roles have culminated in assisting the creation of a society where NGOs serve as important players in the global arena in regards to maintaining human security. Due to this increasing influence and the emergence of growing natural and man-made disasters, NGOs now are contracted by governments in order to adequately respond to crises, as well as assist individual or collectivised groups of citizens in lobbying their interests; thus culminating in the ability to enact, influence and change government agendas. However, NGOs are still largely dependent on certain levels of government funding, hence critics may argue that NGOs pose the ability to potentially damage issues of human security due to this financial dependence. Despite these critiqes, the focus, expertise and infrastructure developed by NGOs through their activities linked with human development and human rights allow them to make unique contributions to human security provision.\n\nComprehensive human security attempts to unify environmental security together with social (societal) security. A great number of intertwined environmental and social components together create the framework for comprehensive human security under the assumption that neither of those two categories is attainable in the long run without synergy between the two. That is to say that the trends in environmental, resource, and population stresses are intensifying and will increasingly determine the quality of human life on our planet and as such are a large determining factor of our social security.\n\nArthur H. Westing posits that the two interdependent branches of comprehensive human security can be broken down into a series of subcomponents to better achieve optimal environmental and social security. \nEnvironmental security is composed of two subcomponents: (a) Rational resource utilization, that is resource use that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” \nSocial security can be simplified to components of (a) Established political safeguards, (b) Economic safeguards, (c) Personal safeguards, and (d) Military safeguards.\n\nThe International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) states that a major goal of comprehensive human security is to “transmit practical recommendations to policy-makers on how to strengthen human security through better environmental management and more effective natural resource governance.” The overreaching goal being a pervasive global mindset that recognizes the interdependent natures of the natural environment and our collective social security.\n\nHuman security focuses on the serious neglect of gender concerns under the traditional security model. Traditional security’s focus on external military threats to the state has meant that the majority of threats women face have been overlooked. It has recently been argued that these forms of violence are often overlooked because expressions of masculinity in contexts of war have become the norm. By focusing on the individual, the human security model aims to address the security concerns of both women and men equally. However, as of recent conflicts, it is believed that the majority of war casualties are civilians and that \"such a conclusion has sometimes led to the assumptions that women are victimized by war to a greater extent than men, because the majority of adult civilians are women, and when the populations of civilian women and children are added together, they outnumber male combatants. Furthermore, in the post-war context women survivors generally outnumber men and so it is often said that women as a group bear a greater burden for post-war recovery\". Women are often victims of violence and conflict: they form the majority of civilian deaths; the majority of refugees; and, are often the victims of cruel and degrading practices, such as rape. Women's security is also threatened by unequal access to resources, services and opportunities. The UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, as of 1995, suggested that the problem is not just a social one, but requires evaluation of the political institutions which uphold unequal system of domination. Women's rights are neglected especially in the Middle East and Southeast Asian regions where customary practices are still prevalent. Although there are different opinions on the issue of customary practices, it infringes upon human security's notion where women and men are innated with equal human rights. Attempts to eradicate such violent customary practices requires political and legal approaches where human security in relation to gender should be brought up as the main source of assertion. Such cruel customary practices as honor killing, burning brides and widows, child marriage are still in existence because of women's vulnerability in economic independence and security. Human security in relationship to gender tries to overthrow such traditional practices that are incompatible to the rights of women. Also human security seeks to empower women, through education, participation and access, as gender equality is seen as a necessary precondition for peace, security and a prosperous society.\n\nDuring times of conflict, certain varieties of masculinity come to be celebrated by the State, and these varieties of behaviors can influence how a population's combatants come to behave, or are expected to behave during crises. These behaviors range from acting aggressively and exemplifying hyper-masculine behaviors, to playing upon the rise of \"nationalist or ethnic consciousness\" to secure \"political support for the cause and to undermine \"the Other\". Overtly militaristic societies have utilized rape and other sexually violent acts to further their gains within the context of war, but also by using such practices of violence as rewards to the (often male) combatants. This tactic undermines the enemy's morale, as they are seen as \"unable to protect their women\".\n\nRecent feminist critiques of Human Security often find difficulties with the concept and categorization of \"Human\". This categorization is made under the influence of certain value systems which are inherently exclusive by their nature. For instance, the liberal definition of \"human\" is: someone that is independent and capable of making decisions for themselves. This definition is problematic because it excludes persons who are not independent, such as persons with disabilities, from human security rights. If Human Security was to be entirely inclusive it would need to challenge the current definition of \"human\" on which it operates and acknowledge that different abilities also require rights.\n\nThe concept of human security has developed out of the precepts put forth by the United Nations, wherein there has been critique of Human Security's focus on what is deemed acceptable behaviors. Human security perspectives view practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation as a threat to human (more specifically women) security and well-being in the Global North, while it is more common that these events occur predominately in the Global Southern states. Thus it is seen by states with a traditional human security outlook, to see it as their duty to intervene and perpetuate this eurocentric ideal of what human security looks like, and what is best to protect the familiar concept of women. This can be seen as an infringement on the traditional practices found within some sovereign states of the Global South, and a threat to ways of life and processes of development.\n\nHuman security seeks to address underlying causes and long-term implications of conflicts instead of simply reacting to problems, as the traditional security approach is often accused of doing. \"The basic point of preventive efforts is, of course, to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, the need for intervention altogether,\" while an investment in rehabilitation or rebuilding seeks to ensure that former conflicts do not breed future violence. The concepts of prevention and rebuilding are clearly embraced as the “responsibility to prevent” and well elaborated in \"The Responsibility to protect report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty.\"\n\nIn several senses there is a natural fit between human security concepts and humanitarian principles. The concern with the protection of people or individuals is a core humanitarian value as well as of human security. In this sense it shares human security’s merging of development and security and the casting of the protection of life as the referent object.\n\nHuman security and humanitarian action also shared a similar process of evolution. The rise of the human security discourse in the 1990s paralleled an equally rapid expansion in humanitarian roles and a broadening in the objectives of humanitarianism that was labeled the ‘new humanitarianism’. Humanitarian assistance, once encompassing a narrow set of emergency based life saving interventions conducted by a small group of relatively independent actors, became ‘an organising principle for intervention in internal conflicts, a tool for peacebuilding and the starting-point for addressing poverty, as well as a palliative in times of conflict and crisis.’ It also merged with development concerns such as the promotion of social justice and societal cohesion.\n\nThe human security discourse was also used as a tool to resist aid policies becoming hijacked by narrow security concerns. States, such as the Republic of Ireland, promoted the Human Security concept as a way to ensure a more balanced approach to security and development issues both nationally and within the EU.\n\nDespite the sense of a natural fit between human security concepts and humanitarian principles they have enjoyed a difficult relationship. Human security perspectives have the potential to interfere with the traditionally apolitical nature of humanitarianism in conflict situations, leading to a blurring of the boundaries between politico-military interventions and those designed primarily to reduce suffering. In another sense the emphasis on human security has legitimised the idea of armed international intervention as a \"moral duty\" if states are deemed incapable or unwilling of protecting their citizens. Similarly the adoption of 'holistic' security and development strategies within UN Integrated peacekeeping missions is viewed by some as having the potential to compromise humanitarian principles.\n\nAuthors such as White and Cliffe drew attention to the way in which the 'broadening of aid objectives from pure survival support towards rehabilitation, development and/ or peace-building' led to the 'dilution of commitment to core humanitarian principles'. Furthermore, many humanitarian organisations have sought to develop rights-based approaches to assistance strategies which challenge the apolitical approach of traditional humanitarianism. Rights based approaches view poverty and vulnerability as rooted in power relations – specifically, the denial of power, which is itself related to the denial of human rights. Hence rights based approaches to humanitarian action relate the achievement of security for marginalized people to the realization of their human rights and often to broader social change. Multimandate humanitarian organisations that seek more inclusive and participatory forms of citizenship and governance and the achievement of broader social rights outcomes therefore risk enmeshing apolitical humanitarian responses in advocacy programmes that push for broader social changes.\n\nWhile there are numerous examples of the human security approach in action, two notable global political events with direct ties to the human security agenda include the development of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) principles guiding humanitarian intervention and the passage of the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.\n\nThe application of human security is highly relevant within the area of humanitarian intervention, as it focuses on addressing the deep rooted and multi-factorial problems inherent in humanitarian crises, and offers more long term resolutions. In general, the term humanitarian intervention generally applies to when a state uses force against another state in order to alleviate suffering in the latter state (See, humanitarian intervention).\n\nUnder the traditional security paradigm humanitarian intervention is contentious. As discussed above, the traditional security paradigm places emphasis on the notion of states. Hence, the principles of state sovereignty and non-intervention that are paramount in the traditional security paradigm make it difficult to justify the intervention of other states in internal disputes. Through the development of clear principles based on the human security concept, there has been a step forward in the development of clear rules of when humanitarian intervention can occur and the obligations of states that intervene in the internal disputes of a state.\n\nThese principles on humanitarian intervention are the product of a debate pushed by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. He posed a challenge to the international community to find a new approach to humanitarian intervention that responded to its inherent problems. In 2001, the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) produced the \"Responsibility to protect\", a comprehensive report detailing how the “right of humanitarian intervention” could be exercised. It was considered a triumph for the human security approach as it emphasized and gathered much needed attention to some of its main principles:\n\n\nThe report illustrates the usefulness of the human security approach, particularly its ability to examine the cause of conflicts that explain and justify humanitarian intervention. In addition, it could also act as a paradigm for identifying, prioritizing and resolving large transnational problems, one of the fundamental factors that act as a stimulus for humanitarian intervention in the first place. However, human security still faces difficulties concerning the scope of its applicability, as large problems requiring humanitarian intervention usually are built up from an array of socio-political, cultural and economic problems that may be beyond the limitations of humanitarian projects. On the other hand, successful examples of the use of human security principles within interventions can be found.\n\nThe success of humanitarian intervention in international affairs is varied. As discussed above, humanitarian intervention is a contentious issue. Examples of humanitarian intervention illustrate, that in some cases intervention can lead to disastrous results, as in Srebrenica and Somalia. In other cases, a lack of clarity as to the rules of when intervention can occur has resulted in tragic inaction, as was witnessed during the Rwandan genocide. One example is of a successful humanitarian intervention and also of humanitarian principles being applied is East Timor which, prior to its independence, was plagued with massive human rights abuses by pro-Indonesian militias and an insurgency war led by indigenous East Timorese against Indonesian forces. A peacekeeping mission was deployed to safeguard the move to independence and the UN established the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This not only dealt with traditional security priorities, but also helped in nation building projects, coordinated humanitarian aid and civil rehabilitation, illustrating not only a successful humanitarian intervention but also an effective application of human security principles.\n\nIn contrast to the traditional security discourse which sees security as focused on protecting state interests, human security proponents believe that Anti-personnel mines could not be viable weapons of war due to the massive collateral damage they cause, their indiscriminate nature and persistence after conflict. In particular, they argue that Anti-personnel mines differ from most weapons, which have to be aimed and fired since they have the potential to kill and maim long after the warring parties have ceased fighting. The United Nations has reckoned that landmines are at least ten times more likely to kill or injure a civilian after a conflict than a combatant during hostilities. The effects are also long-lasting. The ICBL estimates that anti-personnel mines were the cause of 5,751 casualties in 2006. Whereas traditionally, states would justify these negative impacts of mines due to the advantage they give on the battlefield, under the human security lens, this is untenable as the wide-ranging post-conflict impact on the day-to-day experience of individuals outweighs the military advantage.\n\nThe Ottawa Convention, which led to the banning of anti-personnel landmines, is seen as a victory for the Human Security agenda. The Ottawa Convention has proved to be a huge step forward in the 'Freedom from Fear' approach. In Ottawa, the negotiations were moved outside traditional disarmament forums, thus avoiding the entrenched logic of traditional arms control measures.\nAccording to Don Hubert, an advocate of Human Security from the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, the main reason for its success was a multilateral focus. While INGO's like the UN and the ICRC remain the key players along with middle power states like Norway and Canada, its actual power and push comes from the involvement of a host of civil society actors (NGOs) and the general public. Human Security proponents believe that this treaty has set new standards in humanitarian advocacy and has acted as a landmark in international lawmaking for a more secure world.\n\nCritics of the treaty, however, caution against complacency on its success. Many states, they point out, have neither signed nor ratified this convention. They include China, Russia and the United States who are major contributors to the global weapons trade. Second, even though there were a diverse group of civil society actors, the real influence on the treaty came from the ones in the 'global north'. Third, cynics may argue that the success of this campaign stems from the fact that these weapons were outdated and of limited military value and this treaty just helped to accelerate a process that would have happened anyway.\n\nWalter Dorn raises several additional criticisms. In particular he asks whether it is in fact as radical a departure in foreign policy terms as is sometimes claimed. Dorn argues that international community has been concerned with issues of human safety since at least the time of the establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the 1860s. Stuart Gordon argues that Canada, one of its principal adherents, has in many ways simply recast its traditional Pearsonian foreign policy in the language of human security. \nDorn also questioned whether the concept was really necessary ‘since all the initiatives in the human security agenda were already advancing before the advent of the concept.’ Finally he suggests that the concept may be counterproductive. In their effort to fortify against ‘virtually limitless UN interventionism’ governments may repress ‘their populations into servility.\"\n\nRichard Jolly and Deepayan Basu Ray, in their UNDP report, suggest that the key criticisms of human security include: Human security does not have any definite boundaries, therefore anything and everything could be considered a risk to security. This makes the task of policy formulation nearly impossible; Human security, when broadened to include issues like climate change and health, complicates the international machinery for reaching decisions or taking action on the threats identified; Human security risks engaging the military in issues best tackled through non-military means; Human security under the UN risks raising hopes about the UN’s capacity, which it cannot fulfil.\n\nOther authors, such as Roland Paris, argue that human security is not such a fundamental recasting of the security debate in terms of a central struggle ‘between Realist, traditional, state-based, interest-based, approaches and new, Liberal cosmopolitan, de-territorialised, values-based approaches, which focus on individual human needs. ‘ Rather, he suggests that the talk of two radically different ‘paradigms’ has been much exaggerated.\n\nAs if to answer the points above, a Human Security Index was prototyped and released in 2008. Project coordinator D. A. Hastings notes that \"if one were challenged to create an index on the condition of people-centric Human Security, such as the authors of the Human Development Index faced in 1990 and expanded qualitatively in 1994, one could now begin to do so – at least for the sake of discussion and resultant improvements.\" The release document and a United Nations Bangkok Working Paper publish and discuss the original approach, which is based partly on:\n\nA 2010 enhancement to the HSI recast the composite index around a trinity of Economic, Environmental, and Social Fabric Indices. The result is thus conceptually similar to the Triple Bottom Line of Corporate Social Responsibility as described by John Elkington, as well as to the stated goals of the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. The release note of HSI Version 2 also notes efforts to balance local and global context, individual and society concerns, left-right political issues, east-west and north-south cultural and social issues. Current Version 2 of the HSI ingests about 30 datasets and composite indicators, and covers 232 countries and dependencies. It is released at HumanSecurityIndex.org.\n\nConsiderable differences in national ratings and standings have been noted between the HSI and indicators such as GDP per capita or the Human Development Index. Several small island countries plus Bhutan, Botswana, and some central-eastern European countries do considerably better in the HSI than they do in GDP per capita or HDI. Conversely, Greece and some Eurozone peers such as Ireland and Spain, several countries in the Gulf, Israel, Equatorial Guinea, the USA and Venezuela do worse in the HSI than in GDP per capita or HDI. Influential factors vary (as is viewed in the data and discussions on the HumanSecurityIndex.org Website), but include diversity and income equality, peacefulness, and governance.\n\n"}
{"id": "819478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=819478", "title": "Kabyle language", "text": "Kabyle language\n\nKabyle , or Kabylian (native name: \"Taqbaylit\", ), is a Berber language spoken by the Kabyle people in the north and northeast of Algeria. It is spoken primarily in Kabylie, east of the capital Algiers and in Algiers itself, but also by various groups near Blida, such as the Beni Salah and Beni Bou Yaqob.\n\nEstimates of the number of speakers range from five million to about seven million speakers worldwide, the majority in Algeria, according to INALCO.\n\nKabyle is one of the Berber languages, a family within Afroasiatic. It is believed to have broken off very early from proto-Berber, although after the Zenaga language did so.\n\nKabyle Berber is native to Kabylie. It is present in seven Algerian districts.\n\nApproximately one-third of Algerians are Berber-speakers, clustered mostly near Algiers, in Kabylian and Shawi, but with some communities in the west, east and south of the country. Kabyles are the largest Berber group in Algeria, but may not constitute a majority.\n\nThe populations of Béjaïa (Bgayet), Bouïra (Tubirett) and Tizi Ouzou (Tizi Wezzu) provinces are in majority Kabyle-speaking. Kabyle is mainly spoken in the provinces of Boumerdès, and as well as in Bordj Bou Arréridj, Jijel, and in Algiers where it coexists with Algerian Arabic.\n\nKabyle Berber is also spoken as a native language among the Algerian Kabyle-descended diaspora in European and North American cities (mainly France). It is estimated that half of Kabyles live outside the Kabylian region.\n\nAfter the 2001–02 widespread Kabyle protests known as the Black Spring, the Berber (Amazigh) language (with all its Algerian dialects and varieties) was recognized as a 'national language' in the 2002 Algerian Constitution, but not as an 'official language' until 2016 after a long campaign by activists. The Arabic language is still the only \"de jure\" official language of Algeria. French is not recognized in any legal document of Algeria but enjoys a \"de facto\" position of an official language as it is used in every Algerian official administration or institution, at all levels of the government, sometimes much more than Arabic.\n\nThe Berber (Amazigh) language faces an unfavourable environment, despite a public radio (Channel II, which dates back to the Algerian War), as well as a public TV channel (Channel IV or Tamazight TV). Since private ownership of TV channels is illegal in Algeria, Kabyles have launched a private Kabyle speaking TV channel, called \"Berbère Television\", that broadcasts from Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in France (93).\n\nIn 1994, Kabyle pupils and students boycotted Algerian schools for a year, demanding the officialization of Berber, leading to the symbolic creation of the \"Haut Commissariat à l'Amazighité\" (HCA) in 1995. Berber was subsequently taught as a non-compulsory language in Berber speaking areas. The course being optional, few people attend.\n\nPresident Bouteflika has frequently stated that \"Amazigh (the Berber language) will never be an official language, and if it has to be a national language, it must be submitted to a referendum\".\nIn 2005, President Bouteflika, stated that \"there is no country in the world with two official languages\" and \"this will never be the case of Algeria\".\nNevertheless, after four decades of pacific struggle, riots, strikes, and social mobilization, including the Berber spring (1980, riots and strikes in the Kabylie region of Tizi Ouzou, Bouira and Bejaïa, as well as Algiers) and the Black Spring in 2001, President Bouteflika and his government stepped back and submitted to the Kabylie pressure by recognising Amazigh (Berber) as a \"national language\" without a referendum.\n\nMany identify two dialects: Greater Kabylie (west) and Lesser Kabylie (east), but the reality is more complex than that, Kabyle dialects constitute a dialect continuum that can be divided into four main dialects (from west to east):\n\n\nAt the exception of Far-eastern dialect, much of the vocabulary of Kabyle is common among its dialects though some lexical differences exist, example for the word \"dream\" in english (from west to east): bargu, argu, argu, bureg.\n\nThe phonemes below reflect the pronunciation of Kabyle.\n\nKabyle has three phonemic vowels:\n\nThe phonetic realization of the vowels, especially , is influenced by the character of the surrounding consonants; emphatic consonants invite a more open realization of the vowel, e.g. aẓru = 'stone' vs. amud = 'seed'. Often /a, i, u/ are realized as .\n\nIn the Kabyle language there are various accents which are the result of assimilations (these accents are generally divided into western and eastern Kabyle). Some of these assimilations are present among all Kabyle \"dialects\" and some not. These assimilations are not noted in writing, such as:\n\n\nGemination affects the quality of certain consonants, turning semivowels and fricatives into stops; in particular, geminated \"ɣ\" becomes \"qq\", geminated \"y\" becomes \"gg\", and geminated \"w\" becomes \"bb\".\n\nKabyle is mostly composed of fricatives, phonemes which are originally stops in other Berber languages, but in writing there is no difference between fricatives and stops. Below is a list of fricatives vs. stops and when they are pronounced (note that gemination turns fricatives into stops).\n\nThe most ancient Berber writings were written in the Libyco-Berber script (Tifinagh). Such writings have been found in Kabylie (also known as Kabylia) and continue to be discovered by archeologists.\n\nTifinagh alphabet disappeared in the seventh century, when Latin became the official and administrative language in North Africa, as in rest of the former Roman empire.\n\nThe first French–Kabyle dictionary was compiled by a French ethnologist in the 18th century. It was written in Latin script with an orthography based on that of French.\n\nHowever, the Kabyle language really became a written language again in the beginning of the 19th century. Under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the Latin script. \"Tamacahutt n wuccen\" by Brahim Zellal was one of the first Kabyle books written using this alphabet.\n\nAfter the independence of Algeria, some Kabyle activists tried to revive the Libyco-Berber script, which is still in use by the Tuareg. Attempts were made to modernize the writing system by modifying the shape of the letters and by adding vowels, but its use remains limited to logos. Kabyle literature continued to be written in Latin script. This new version of Tifinagh has been called Neo-Tifinagh and has been adopted as the official script for Berber languages in Morocco.\n\nMouloud Mammeri codified a new orthography for the Kabyle language which avoided using French orthography. His script has been adopted by all Berber linguists, the INALCO, and the Algerian HCA. It uses diacritics and two letters from the extended Latin alphabet: Čč Ḍḍ Ɛɛ Ǧǧ Ɣɣ Ḥḥ Ṣṣ Ṭṭ Ẓẓ.\n\nKabyle has two genders: masculine and feminine. As in most Berber languages, masculine nouns and adjectives generally start with a vowel (\"a-\", \"i-\", \"u-\"), while feminine nouns generally start with \"t-\" and end with a \"-t\", e.g. aqcic 'boy' vs. taqcict 'girl'.\n\nPlurals generally are formed by replacing initial \"a-\" with \"i-\", and either suffixing \"-en\" (\"regular/external\" plurals), changing vowels within the word (\"broken/internal\" plurals), or both. Examples: \n\nAs in all Berber languages, Kabyle has two types of states or cases of the noun: \"free state\" and construct state (or 'annexed state'). The free state is morphologically unmarked. The construct state is derived either by changing initial /a-/ to /u-/, loss of initial vowel in some feminine nouns, addition of a semi-vowel word-initially, or in some cases no change occurs at all:\n\nAs in Central Morocco Tamazight, construct state is used for subjects placed after their verbs, after prepositions, in noun complement constructions, and after certain numerals. Kabyle also places nouns in construct state when they head a noun phrase containing a co-referential bound pronoun earlier in the utterance.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nAfter a preposition (with the exception of \"ar\" and \"s\"), all nouns take their annexed state:\n\n\nVerbs are conjugated for three tenses : the Preterite (past), intensive Aorist (present perfect, present continuous, past continuous) and the future (Ad+Aorist). Unlike other Berber languages, the aorist alone is rarely used in Kabyle (In the other languages it is used to express the present).\n\n\n\nVerbs are conjugated for person by adding affixes. These suffixes are static and identical for all tenses (only the theme changes). The epenthetic vowel \"e\" may be inserted between the affix and the verb. Verbs are always marked for subject and may also inflect for person of direct and indirect object.\n\nExamples\n\nKabyle is a satellite-framed based language, Kabyle verbs use two particles to show the path of motion:\n\nExamples:\n\nKabyle usually expresses negation in two parts, with the particle \"ur\" attached to the verb, and one or more negative words that modify the verb or one of its arguments. For example, simple verbal negation is expressed by « \"ur\" » before the verb and the particle « \"ara\" » after the verb:\nOther negative words (acemma ... etc.) are used in combination with \"ur\" to express more complex types of negation. This system developed via Jespersen's cycle.\n\nVerb derivation is performed by adding affixes. There are three types of derivation forms : Causative, reflexive and Passive.\n\nTwo prefixes can cancel each other:\n\nEvery verb has a corresponding agent noun. In English it could be translated into verb+er. It is obtained by prefixing the verb with « am- » or with « an- » if the first letter is b / f / m / w (there are exceptions however).\n\n\nVerbal nouns are derived differently from different classes of verbal stems (including 'quality verbs'). Often \"a-\" or \"t(u)-\" is prefixed:\n\nPronouns may either occur as standalone words or bound to nouns or verbs.\n\nExample : « Ula d nekk. » – \"Me too.\"\n\nPossessive pronouns are bound to the modified noun.\n\nExample : « Axxam-nneɣ. » – \"Our house.\" (House-our)\n\nThere are three demonstratives, near-deictic ('this, these'), far-deictic ('that, those') and absence. They may either be suffixed to nouns, or appear in isolation. Examples: « Axxam-a / Axxam-agi» – \"This house.\", (House-this), «Wagi yelha» – \"This is nice.\" (This is-nice).\n\nPrepositions precede their objects: « \"i medden\" » \"to the people\", « \"si taddart\" » \"from the village\". All words preceded by a preposition (except « \"s\" » and « \"ar\" », \"towards\", \"until\" ) take the annexed state.\n\nSome prepositions have two forms : one is used with pronominal suffixes and the other form is used in all other contexts, e.g. \"ger\" 'between' → \"gar\".\n\nSome prepositions have a corresponding relative pronoun (or interrogative), for example: \n\nNegation\n\nPredicative particle 'd'\n\nThe predicative particle 'd' is an indispensable tool in speaking Kabyle (or any other Amazigh language). \"d\" is equivalent to both \"it is + adjective\" and \"to be + adjective\", but cannot be replaced by the verb \"ili\" (to be). It is always followed by a noun in free state.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe predicative particle \"d\" should not be confused with the particle of coordination \"d\"; indeed, the former is followed by a noun at its annexed state while the first is always followed by a noun at its free state.\n\nKabyle has absorbed quite some Arabic and Latin vocabulary. According to Salem Chaker, about a third of Kabyle vocabulary is of foreign origin; the number of French loanwords has not been studied yet. These loanwords are sometimes Berberized and sometimes kept in their original form. The Berberized words follow the regular grammar of Kabyle (free and annexed state).\n\nExamples of Berberized Arabic or French words:\n\nMany loanwords from Arabic have often a different meaning in Kabyle:\n\nAll verbs of Arabic origin follow a Berber conjugation and verbal derivation:\n\nOnly the first two numbers are Berber; for higher numbers, Arabic is used. They are \"yiwen\" (f. \"yiwet\") \"one\", \"sin\" (f. \"snat\") \"two\". The noun being counted follows it in the genitive: \"sin n yirgazen\" \"two men\".\n\nIn. MOULIERAS (Auguste), les fourberies de si Djeh'a.\nNote: the predicative particle d was translated as \"it.is\", the particle of direction d was translated as \"here\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

In contrast, the unvoiced \"kototama\" pronunciation especially refers to , which was popularized by Onisaburo Deguchi in the Oomoto religion. This field takes the Japanese \"gojūon\" phonology as the mystical basis of words and meanings, in rough analogy to Hebrew Kabbalah.\n\nThe etymology of \"kotodama\" is uncertain, but one explanation correlating words and events links two Japanese words pronounced \"koto\": this \"word; words; speech\" and \"situation; circumstances; state of affairs; occurrence; event; incident\". These two \"kanji\" were used interchangeably in the name Kotoshironushi or , an oracular \"kami\" mentioned in the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon shoki\". \"Kotodama\" is related with Japanese words such as \"kotoage\" \"words raised up; invoke the magical power of words\", \"kotomuke\" \"directed words; cause submission though the power of words\", and \"jumon\" \"magic spell; magic words; incantation\".\n\n\"Kotodama\" is a central concept in Japanese mythology, Shinto, and Kokugaku. For example, the \"Kojiki\" describes an \"ukei\" (or \"seiyaku\") \"covenant; trial by pledge\" between the sibling gods Susanoo and Amaterasu, \"Let each of us swear, and produce children\". Uttering the divine words of the Shinto divination ritual known as \"ukehi\" supposedly determines results, and in this case, Amaterasu giving birth to five male deities proved that Susanoo's intentions were pure.\n\n\"Kototama\" or \"kotodama\" is also fundamental to Japanese martial arts, for instance, in the use of kiai. Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of aikido and a student of Deguchi, used \"kototama\" as a spiritual basis for his teachings. William Gleason says Ueshiba \"created aikido based on the \"kototama\" principle,\" and quotes him that \"Aikido is the superlative way to practice the \"kototama\". It is the means by which one realizes his true nature as a god and finds ultimate freedom.\" Mutsuro Nakazono, a disciple of Ueshiba, wrote books on the importance of \"kototama\" in aikido, such as \"The Kotoma Principle\" in 1983.\n\nWhile other cultures have parallels to \"kotodama\", such as mantra, mana, and logos, some Japanese people believe the \"word spirit\" is unique to the Japanese language. One of the classical names of Japan is , a phrase that originated in the \"Man'yōshū\".\n\n"}

The local governments were allowed, however, to levy an additional charge on certain outgoing mail items to defray their costs and in January 1987 the first local postal surcharge label was used in Guangdong.\n\nThe labels quickly became popular and, eventually, labels were issued in 25 different provinces. Around 1500 different labels are known. The rules set for their use were as follows:\n\nRecording the extra charge was done in a variety of ways, including manuscript marks, postal chop marks, extra postage stamps and printed labels.\n\nWhere printed labels were used they were of widely varying designs and could be of one, two or three parts to enable record keeping. Some were multi-coloured, perforated and similar to postage stamps like the label from Ankang shown above, others were crude productions in one colour similar to tickets or store receipts.\n\nLocal governments and postal officials successfully seized the opportunity to raise additional funds. Hubei province, for instance, introduced a rule that from 1 January 1993 a charge be made to finance postal development and a label was issued by a postmaster in Susong in support of China's bid for the 2000 Olympic Games. As time went on more stamp-like labels were produced and they were often banned by the central government within days of issue. Some may well have been purely philatelic issues with no genuine function.\n\nThe use of the labels was never popular with the Chinese government and eventually it was banned completely in 1999.\n\nThe wide variety of the labels and their varying use mean that they defy easy philatelic classification. They are not strictly local stamps, although locally produced, and not stamps of the central government of China. The charge levied may be seen as a form of local tax on each letter originating in a particular province, in which case they fall into the category of fiscal or revenue stamps. Labels produced purely for philatelic purposes or outside of the rules are cinderella stamps.\n\nPhilatelists prefer to collect these labels on cover as this gives the fullest information about the label and confirms genuine postal use.\n\nNo definitive catalogue exists of all the labels used as the Chinese government initially suppressed their display at stamp exhibitions and it is likely that many items remain to be discovered and catalogued. Much of what has been published in this area is in Chinese.\n\nCollectors have used postcodes printed on the labels to indicate probable origins and as a method of classification.\n\n\n\n"}

Medical terminology is used in the field of medicine.\n\nMedical terminology has quite regular morphology, the same prefixes and suffixes are used to add meanings to different roots. The root of a term often refers to an organ, tissue, or condition. For example, in the disorder hypertension, the prefix \"hyper-\" means \"high\" or \"over\", and the root word \"tension\" refers to pressure, so the word \"hypertension\" refers to abnormally high blood pressure. The roots, prefixes and suffixes are often derived from Greek or Latin, and often quite dissimilar from their English-language variants. This regular morphology means that once a reasonable number of morphemes are learnt it becomes easy to understand very precise terms assembled from these morphemes. A lot of medical language is anatomical terminology, concerning itself with the names of various parts of the body.\n\nIn forming or understanding a word root, one needs a basic comprehension of the terms and the source language. The study of the origin of words is called etymology. For example, if a word was to be formed to indicate a condition of kidneys, there are two primary roots – one from Greek (νεφρός \"nephr(os)\") and one from Latin (\"ren(es)\"). Renal failure would be a condition of kidneys, and nephritis is also a condition, or inflammation, of the kidneys. The suffix \"-itis\" means inflammation, and the entire word conveys the meaning inflammation of the kidney. To continue using these terms, other combinations will be presented for the purpose of examples: The term \"supra-renal\" is a combination of the prefix \"supra-\" (meaning \"above\"), and the word root for kidney, and the entire word means \"situated above the kidneys\". The word \"nephrologist\" combines the root word for kidney to the suffix \"-ologist\" with the resultant meaning of \"one who studies the kidneys\".\n\nThe formation of plurals should usually be done using the rules of forming the proper plural form in the source language. Greek and Latin each have differing rules to be applied when forming the plural form of the word root. Often such details can be found using a medical dictionary.\n\nMedical terminology often uses words created using prefixes and suffixes in Latin and Ancient Greek. In medicine, their meanings, and their etymology, are informed by the language of origin. Prefixes and suffixes, primarily in Greek—but also in Latin, have a dropable \"-o-\". Medical roots generally go together according to language: Greek prefixes go with Greek suffixes and Latin prefixes with Latin suffixes. Although it is technically considered acceptable to create hybrid words, it is strongly preferred not to mix different lingual roots. Examples of well-accepted medical words that do mix lingual roots are neonatology and quadriplegia.\n\n\"Prefixes\" do not normally require further modification to be added to a word root because the prefix normally ends in a vowel or vowel sound, although in some cases they may assimilate slightly and an \"in-\" may change to \"im-\" or \"syn-\" to \"sym-\".\n\n\"Suffixes\" are attached to the end of a word root to add meaning such as condition, disease process, or procedure.\n\nIn the process of creating medical terminology, certain rules of language apply. These rules are part of language mechanics called linguistics. The word root is developed to include a vowel sound following the term to add a smoothing action to the sound of the word when applying a suffix. The result is the formation of a new term with a vowel attached (word root + vowel) called a combining form. In English, the most common vowel used in the formation of the combining form is the letter \"-o-\", added to the word root. For example if there is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, this would be written as \"gastro-\" and \"enter-\" plus \"-itis\", gastroenteritis.\n\nSuffixes are categorized as either (1) needing the combining form, or (2) not needing the combining form since they start with a vowel.\n"}

Many Memons have settled in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan since the independence in 1947.\n\nThe true origin of the language is still debated among the historians of the regions. However, it is common to believe that Memoni language actually originated as a dialect of Sindhi language. Within the language itself, there are currently many different dialects, some having more influence of one language, and others having that of others. The language has not been organized greatly, hence, neither having its alphabetical system of reading and writing, nor having its literature and dictionary. This is one of the reasons the disorientation among the speakers themselves for deciding which words are better for what, as there is a wide variety of vocabulary available. Haji Mohammed Husein Abdel Kareem Nagani invented the alphabet of Memon language.\n\nThe Memon community is generally divided into three major subgroups: Kathiawadi Memons, Sindhi Memons (who speak the Sindhi language) and Kutchi Memons (who speak Kutchi) The first category (Memons originating in Kathiawar) are simply called \"Memons\", and they speak the \"Memon\" language, the subject of this article. These people are mostly Muslims (and mostly Sunni Hanafi), who migrated from Sindh to Kathiawar several centuries ago. Sindhi and Kutchi languages are spoken by both Muslims and non-Muslims, in contrast to the Memon language, which is exclusively spoken by Memons of Kathiawadi origin, who are almost entirely Muslim.\n\nIn stress, intonation, and everyday speech, Memoni is very similar to Sindhi, but it borrows extensively from Gujarati, Hindustani and lately English. Like most languages of the Indian subcontinent the sentence structure of Memoni generally follows subject–object–verb order. In Pakistan, Memoni has adopted many Urdu words and phrases. Even between different villages of Kathiawar, variations arose. For example, in Ranavav, the word for sugar is \"khand\", while in Jodiya, it is \"chinni\".\n\nThe most nouns has a grammatical gender, either masculine or feminine and often have singular and plural forms. The Memons borrow vast majorities of the nouns from Hindustani (mixture of Urdu & Hindi) languages and lately extensive use of English vocabulary.\n\nThere is no equivalent for the definite article ‘the’, and the indefinite article ‘a’ is further inflected as masculine or feminine with its object.\n\nThe subject pronouns second person(s) ‘You’ is expressed two different ways; one is the polite form ‘aaen’ (cognate with ‘avheen’ in standard Sindhi) used for respect generally for a stranger, elderly and well respected persons including parents and relatives and the second ‘tu’ (the same as in standard Sindhi) is informal and used among close friends and when addressing subordinates. The object, possessive and reflexive pronouns are often inflected for masculine and feminine and must agree with its object.\n\nSee \n\nIn most Indic languages the third person such as, he, she, it and they and the demonstrative pronouns this, these, that, those same pronouns are used and they are divided into two categories; one for a near object or person and the other for a far object or person.\n\nNo significant differences are among the object, possessive and reflexive pronouns. In addition these pronouns are further inflected for masculine and feminine and must agree to the object (noun, pronouns, adjective and adverbs).\n\nThe verbs generally conjugated (in form, according to many factors, including its tense, aspect, mood and voice. It also agree with the person, gender, and/or number of some of its arguments (subject, object, etc.). The verb generally appears at the end of the sentence.\n\nLike English, the position of the adjectives nearly always appears immediately before the noun and they are modified and often inflected for masculine and feminine and must be agree to the noun that follows. The proposition generally comes after a noun or a verb.\n\nIn the past there was some attempt to write the Memoni dialect using Gujrati and later in Urdu script with little success. Lately some attempt has been made to write Memoni using Roman script.\n\nReference: Origin of Memoni Language a Memoni Language Project by Siddique Katiya\n"}
{"id": "22253822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22253822", "title": "Primal scene", "text": "Primal scene\n\nIn psychoanalysis, the primal scene () is the initial witnessing by a child of a sex act, usually between the parents, that traumatizes the psychosexual development of that child. The scene witnessed may also occur between animals, and be displaced onto humans.\n\nThe expression \"primal scene\" refers to the sight of sexual relations between the parents, as observed, constructed, or fantasized by the child and interpreted by the child as a scene of violence. The scene is not understood by the child, remaining enigmatic but at the same time provoking sexual excitement.\n\nThe term appeared for the first time in Freud's published work apropos of the \"Wolf Man\" case (1918b [1914]), but the notion of a sexual memory experienced too early to have been translated into verbal images, and thus liable to return in the form of conversion symptoms or obsessions, was part of his thinking as early as 1896 [as witnessed in his letter of May 30 of that year to Wilhelm Fliess, where he evokes a \"surplus of sexuality\" that \"impedes translation\" (1950a, pp. 229–230)]. Here Freud is already close to the model of the trauma and its \"deferred\" effect. The following year, in his letter to Fliess of May 2, Freud uses the actual term \"Urszene\" for the first time; and gives the approximate age when in his estimation children were liable to \"hear things\" that they would understand only \"subsequently\" as six or seven months (SE 1, p. 247). The subject of the child's witnessing parental coitus came up as well, albeit in an older child, with the case of \"Katharina,\" in the \"Studies on Hysteria\" (1895d), and Freud evoked it yet again in \"The Interpretation of Dreams\", with the fantasy of the young man who dreamed of watching his parents copulating during his life in the womb (1900a [addition of 1909], pp. 399–400).\n\nFreud persistently strove to decide whether the primal scene was a fantasy or something actually witnessed; above all, he placed increasing emphasis on the child's own fantasy interpretation of the scene as violence visited upon the mother by the father. He went so far, in \"On the Sexual Theories of Children\" (1908c, p. 221), as to find a measure of justification for what he called the \"sadistic concept of coitus\", suggesting that, though the child may exaggerate, the perception of a real repugnance towards sexual intercourse on the part of a mother fearful of another pregnancy may be quite accurate. In the case of \"Little Hans,\" however, the violence was explained in terms of a prohibition: Hans deemed it analogous to \"smashing a window-pane or forcing a way into an enclosed space\" (1909b, p. 41).\n\nThe case history of the Wolf Man gave Freud the opportunity not only to pursue the issue of the reality of the primal scene, but also to propose the idea that it lay at the root of childhood (and later adult) neurosis: the sexual development of the child was \"positively splintered up by it\" (1918b [1914), pp. 43–44). In his \"Introductory Lectures\", however, he argued for the universality of the fantasy of the primal scene (like the sexual theories of children): it may be encountered in all neurotics, if not in every human being (Freud, 1915f), and it belongs in the category of \"primal\" fantasies. It appears, however, not to have the same force for all individuals. Freud would later assign a central place to the primal scene in his analysis of Marie Bonaparte, although in her case the scene took place between her nanny and a groom (Bonaparte, 1950–53).\n\nLooked upon as an actual event rather than as a pure fantasy reconstructed in a retrospective way (as with Carl Jung's \"zurückphantasieren\"), the primal scene had a much more marked traumatic impact, and this led Freud to insist on the \"reality\" of such scenes, thus returning to the debate over event-driven (or \"historical\") reality versus psychic reality. Beyond the issue of the scene itself, however, it was the whole subject of fantasy that was thus raised (in chapter five of the Wolf Man case-history [1918b, pp. 48–60]), discussed in terms that would be picked up by Freud again later in \"Constructions in Analysis\" (1937d).\n\nIt was not merely, in Freud's view, that the technique of psychoanalysis demanded that fantasies be treated as realities so as to give their evocation all the force they needed, but also that many \"real\" scenes were not accessible by way of recollection, but solely by way of dreams. Whether a scene was constructed out of elements observed elsewhere and in a different context (for example, animal coitus transposed to the parents); reconstituted on the basis of clues (such as bloodstained sheets); or indeed observed directly, but at an age when the child still had not the corresponding verbal images at its disposal; did not fundamentally alter the basic facts of the matter: \"I intend on this occasion,\" wrote Freud, \"to close the discussion of the reality of the primal scene with a non liquet\" (1918b, p. 60).\n\nMelanie Klein's view of the primal scene differed from Freud's, for where Freud saw an enigmatic perception of violence, she saw the child's projective fantasies. Klein considered that a child's curiosity was first provoked by the primal scene, and that typically the child felt both excited and excluded by the primal scene. The sexual relationship between the parents, fantasized as continuous, is also the basis of the \"combined-parent figure\", mother and father seen as locked in mutual (but excluding) gratification.\n\nWhere Klein laid emphasis on the way the infant projected hostile and destructive tendencies onto the primal scene, with the mother pictured therein as just as dangerous for the father as the father is for her, later Kleinians like John Steiner have stressed the creative aspect of the primal scene; and the necessity in analysis of overcoming a splitting of its image between a loving couple on the one hand, and a combined parent figure locked in hate.\n\nThe primal scene is inseparable from the sexual theories of childhood that it serves to create. This disturbing representation, which at once acknowledges and denies the familiar quality of the parents, excludes the child even as it concerns them, as witness the libidinal excitement the child feels in response. Otto Fenichel has stressed the traumatic nature of the excess excitement felt by the child, which they are unable to process — what he called the \"overwhelming unknown\".\n\nThe particularity of the primal scene lies in the fact that the subject experiences in a simultaneous and contradictory way the emergence of the unknown within a familiar world, to which they are bound by vital needs, by expectations of pleasure, and by the self-image that it reflects back to them. The lack of common measure between the child's emotional and psychosexual experience and the words that could give an account of the primal scene creates a gulf that the sexual theories of childhood attempt to bridge. A sadistic reading of the scene combines the child's curiosity about both the origin and the end of life in a representation in which death and life are indeed fused.\n\nNed Lukacher has proposed using the term in literary criticism to refer to a kind of intertextuality in which the ability to interpret one text depends on the meaning of another text. It is \"the interpretive impasse that arises when a reader has good reason to believe that the meaning of one text is historically dependent on the meaning of another text or on a previously unnoticed set of criteria, even though there is no conclusive evidential or archival means of establishing the case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n\n\n——.

The theories behind reference class forecasting were developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. The theoretical work helped Kahneman win the Nobel Prize in Economics.\n\nKahneman and Tversky found that human judgment is generally optimistic due to overconfidence and insufficient consideration of distributional information about outcomes. Therefore, people tend to underestimate the costs, completion times, and risks of planned actions, whereas they tend to overestimate the benefits of those same actions. Such error is caused by actors taking an \"inside view\", where focus is on the constituents of the specific planned action instead of on the actual outcomes of similar ventures that have already been completed.\n\nKahneman and Tversky concluded that disregard of distributional information, i.e. risk, is perhaps the major source of error in forecasting. On that basis they recommended that forecasters \"should therefore make every effort to frame the forecasting problem so as to facilitate utilizing all the distributional information that is available\". Using distributional information from previous ventures similar to the one being forecast is called taking an \"outside view\". Reference class forecasting is a method for taking an outside view on planned actions.\n\nReference class forecasting for a specific project involves the following three steps:\n\nThe reference class problem, also known as reference class tennis, is the discussion of which reference class to use when forecasting a given situation. Suppose someone were trying to predict how long it would take to write a psychology textbook. Reference class tennis would involve debating whether we should take the average of all books (closest to an outside view), just all textbooks, or just all psychology textbooks (closest to an inside view).\n\nWhereas Kahneman and Tversky developed the theories of reference class forecasting, Flyvbjerg and COWI (2004) developed the method for its practical use in policy and planning. The first instance of reference class forecasting in practice is described in Flyvbjerg (2006). This was a forecast carried out in 2004 by the UK government of the projected capital costs for an extension of Edinburgh Trams. The promoter's forecast estimated a cost of £255 million. Taking all available distributional information into account, based on a reference class of comparable rail projects, the reference class forecast estimated a cost of £320 million. A report issued in August 2011 estimated that the final cost of the yet unfinished project would be over £1 billion, for a shorter tram line than the proposed Line 2.\n\nSince the Edinburgh forecast, reference class forecasting has been applied to numerous other projects in the UK, including the £15 (US$29) billion Crossrail project in London. After 2004, The Netherlands, Denmark, and Switzerland have also implemented various types of reference class forecasting.\n\nBefore this, in 2001 (updated in 2011), AACE International (the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering) included Estimate Validation as a distinct step in the recommended practice of Cost Estimating (Estimate Validation is equivalent to Reference class forecasting in that it calls for separate empirical-based evaluations to benchmark the base estimate):\nThe estimate should be benchmarked or validated against or compared to historical experience and/or past estimates of the enterprise and of competitive enterprises to check its appropriateness, competitiveness, and to identify improvement opportunities...Validation examines the estimate from a different perspective and using different metrics than are used in estimate preparation.\nIn the process industries (e.g., oil and gas, chemicals, mining, energy, etc. which tend to dominate AACE's membership), benchmarking (i.e., \"outside view\") of project cost estimates against the historical costs of completed projects of similar types, including probabilistic information, has a long history.\n\n\n"}

A dictionary of the language has been published.\n\nRennellese, also known as Rennell or Bellonese is only one of the many languages in the Pacific, that is spoken in the Central Solomon Islands; mainly the Rennell and Bellona Islands (Jonsson, 1999). For a great deal of time the Solomon Islands were occupied by the British, and pidgin English had become the main language spoken in the Rennell and Bellona Islands, until World War II. At that time the Rennell and Bellona Islands were a battlefield during the Battle of Midway, between the Japanese and Americans; just like Hawaii. During the battle the Japanese occupied most of the area using it as a base. After World War II had, both Rennell and Bellona were still being held by allied forces, until finally gaining independence in 1978 (Levinson, 279-280). Both islands have been working to develop their own government, and Rennellese has been recognized as the official language (Monberg, 2012).\n\nThe Solomon Islands have a population of around 940,000 (in 2016), including 658,000 in the independent state of the Solomon Islands; and only a little over 4000 of these people speak Rennellese. Natives who currently live there refer to themselves as Mungiki for the Bellona Islands and Mugaba for the Rennell Islands, and among the younger generation Avaiki is used to reference both. Ethnic groups in these islands are very widespread and distinct (Ember, 2002). The people of the Rennell and Bellona Islands live in small village communities, with each group having its own culture, and religious practices (Levinson, 284-285). As for government issues, the Solomon Islands as a whole is divided, the islands to the northwest (primarily Bougainville and Buka) belonging to Papua New Guinea, while the rest of the Solomons are their own independent government. Even the Rennell and Bellona Islands alone have their own provincial government known as REN-BEL, the recognizes Rennellese/Bellonese as its own language.\n\nThe consonants of Rennellese consist of /H, K, L, M, N, P, S, T, V, NG, GH, NNG/. The letters /P, T, K/ are regular stops, /B, GH, H, S/ are the fricatives, /M, N, NG/ are the nasals, /L/ is the only lateral, and finally /G/ as a pre-nasal (Elbert, 1988).\n\nThe 5 vowels in the system are /a, e, i, o, u/. Rennellese possess /‘/ which is a glottal stop used to lengthen vowel sounds. The /‘/ can be written before or after the vowel it is lengthening, similar to an English apostrophe (Elbert 1988).\n\nThe typical syllable structure in Rennellese is (C)V. Rennellese favors vowels when making syllables, and not many consonant clusters (Elbert 1988).\n\nThe traditional word order for Rennellese is VSO, but more commonly among younger generations, SVO word order is used. Researchers speculate that this is due to outside influences from the missionaries and World War II (Elbert, 1981). The use of either word order is usually dependent on the person speaking, or whom that person may be speaking with. Both statements and questions may have different ways of being expressed solely based on who the speaker is (Monberg 2011).\n\nRennellese’s morphology is polysynthetic, meaning it has a near-infinite number of morphemes that can be put into a word. Not only can some words have many morphemes, but the range between the amounts is high as well.\n\nMany words in Rennellese use either whole or partial reduplication. Reduplication serves three main purposes in Rennellese: pluralization, making a word more specific or changing the whole word.\n\n\nDue to Rennellese long contact with the English language there are a few loan words from English still used today.\n\nThere are many valuable resources that have been created to help maintain the language including a dictionary, and multiple books primarily written by Samuel H. Elbert. Mr. Elbert along with a few other researchers even dedicated an entire website to the people of Rennell and Bellona called Bellona.dk. Rennellese is also the official language of Rennell and Bellona Province. With an official status in their country, the Rennellese have begun opening schools and other domains for the language to be used. The only problem is that some of these materials are from the 1960s-1990s, and are old and hard to come by.\n\nRennellese is classified as a developing language. The number of speakers is only about 4,000 but there is use and intergenerational transmission of the language, allowing it to grow. Rennellese is used as a first language by the majority of the people of Rennell and Bellona. It serves many purposes, being used in education, business, and socializing (Ember 2002). In the long term, Rennellese may be able to see further growth if more technological material is made to both preserve and spread the language.\n\n\n"}

The communication at a roll call is usually top-down, with information disseminated by (or at the direction of) a shift or squad commander.

When written in documents this style is known as Latin book hand. For everyday writing the Romans used a current cursive hand known as Latin cursive. Notable examples of square capitals used for inscriptions are found on the Roman Pantheon, Trajan's Column, and the Arch of Titus, all in Rome. Square capitals are characterized by sharp, straight lines, supple curves, thick and thin strokes, angled stressing and incised serifs. These Roman capitals are also called majuscules, as a counterpart to minuscule letters such as Merovingian and Carolingian.\n\nBefore the 4th century, square capitals were used to write \"de luxe\" copies of the works of authors categorized as \"pagan\" by Christians, especially those of Virgil; the only three surviving manuscripts using this letter, among them the Vergilius Augusteus, contain works by Virgil. After the 5th century the square capitals fell out of use, except as a display lettering for titles and chapter headings in conjunction with various script hands for body text: for example, uncials. \n\nSquare capitals were greatly respected by artisans of the Renaissance such as Geoffroy Tory and Felice Feliciano. A few centuries later, they were also a major inspiration for artisans of the Arts and Crafts movement such as Edward Johnston and Eric Gill, and so many signs and engravings created with an intentionally artistic design in the twentieth century are based on them.\n\nEdward Catich is noted for the fullest development of the thesis that the inscribed Roman square capitals owed their form, including the serifs, wholly to the use of the flat brush, rather than to the exigencies of the chisel or other stone cutting tools. Although not universally accepted, the brushed-origin thesis had been proposed in the nineteenth century. Catich made a complete study and proposed a convincing \"ductus\" by which the forms were created, using a flat brush and then chisel. He promulgated his views in two works, \"Letters Redrawn from the Trajan Inscription in Rome\" and \"The Origin of the Serif: Brush Writing and Roman Letters\".\n\nDuring the early era of the movable type printing press, Roman square capitals became the primary inspiration for the capital letters in early serif typefaces; Roman type, especially that developed by those associated with Aldus Manutius, came to produce a number of typefaces still used to the present day. The 1989 digital typeface Trajan from Adobe is a direct, all-capital adaptation of the Roman square capitals on Trajan's column.\n"}

{"id": "244755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244755", "title": "Sense and reference", "text": "Sense and reference\n\nIn the philosophy of language, the distinction between sense and reference was an innovation of the German philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege in 1892 (in his paper \"On Sense and Reference\"; German: \"Über Sinn und Bedeutung\"), reflecting the two ways he believed a singular term may have meaning.\n\nThe reference (or \"referent\"; \"Bedeutung\") of a proper name is the object it means or indicates (\"bedeuten\"), its sense (\"Sinn\") is what the name expresses. The reference of a sentence is its truth value, its sense is the thought that it expresses. Frege justified the distinction in a number of ways.\n\nMuch of analytic philosophy is traceable to Frege's philosophy of language. Frege's views on logic (i.e., his idea that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the arguments of a mathematical function) led to his views on a theory of reference.\n\nFrege developed his original theory of meaning in early works like \"Begriffsschrift\" ('concept script') of 1879 and \"Grundlagen\" ('foundations of arithmetic') of 1884. On this theory, the meaning of a complete sentence consists in its being true or false, and the meaning of each significant expression in the sentence is an extralinguistic entity which Frege called its \"Bedeutung\", literally 'meaning' or 'significance', but rendered by Frege's translators as 'reference', 'referent', \"'M\"eaning', 'nominatum', etc. Frege supposed that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the arguments of a mathematical function, but that other parts are incomplete, and contain an empty place, by analogy with the function itself. Thus 'Caesar conquered Gaul' divides into the complete term 'Caesar', whose reference is Caesar himself, and the incomplete term '—conquered Gaul', whose reference is a Concept. Only when the empty place is filled by a proper name does the reference of the completed sentence – its truth value – appear. This early theory of meaning explains how the significance or reference of a sentence (its truth value) depends on the significance or reference of its parts.\n\nFrege introduced the notion of \"sense\" (German: \"Sinn\") to accommodate difficulties in his early theory of meaning.\n\nFirst, if the entire significance of a sentence consists of its truth value, it follows that the sentence will have the same significance if we replace a word of the sentence with one having an identical reference, as this will not change its truth value. The reference of the whole is determined by the reference of the parts. If \"the evening star\" has the same reference as \"the morning star\", it follows that \"the evening star is a body illuminated by the Sun\" has the same truth value as \"the morning star is a body illuminated by the Sun\". But it is possible for someone to think that the first sentence is true while also thinking that the second is false. Therefore, the thought corresponding to each sentence cannot be its reference, but something else, which Frege called its \"sense\".\n\nSecond, sentences that contain proper names with no reference cannot have a truth value at all. Yet the sentence 'Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep' obviously has a sense, even though 'Odysseus' has no reference. The thought remains the same whether or not 'Odysseus' has a reference. Furthermore, a thought cannot contain the objects that it is about. For example, Mont Blanc, 'with its snowfields', cannot be a component of the thought that Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high. Nor can a thought about Etna contain lumps of solidified lava.\n\nFrege's notion of sense is somewhat obscure, and neo-Fregeans have come up with different candidates for its role. Accounts based on the work of Carnap and Church treat sense as an intension, or a function from possible worlds to extensions. For example, the intension of ‘number of planets’ is a function that maps any possible world to the number of planets in that world. John McDowell supplies cognitive and reference-determining roles. Devitt treats senses as causal-historical chains connecting names to referents.\n\nIn his theory of descriptions, Bertrand Russell held the view that most proper names in ordinary language are in fact disguised definite descriptions. For example, 'Aristotle' can be understood as \"The pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander,\" or by some other uniquely applying description. This is known as the descriptivist theory of names. Because Frege used definite descriptions in many of his examples, he is often taken to have endorsed the descriptivist theory. Thus Russell's theory of descriptions was conflated with Frege's theory of sense, and for most of the twentieth century this 'Frege-Russell' view was the orthodox view of proper name semantics. However, Saul Kripke argued compellingly against the descriptivist theory. According to Kripke, proper names are rigid designators which designate the same object in every possible world. Descriptions such as 'the President of the U.S. in 1970' do not designate the same in every possible world. For example, someone other than Richard Nixon, e.g. Hubert Humphrey, might have been the President in 1970. Hence a description (or cluster of descriptions) cannot be a rigid designator, and thus a proper name cannot \"mean\" the same as a description.\n\nHowever, the Russellian descriptivist reading of Frege has been rejected by many scholars, in particular by Gareth Evans in \"The Varieties of Reference\" and by John McDowell in \"The Sense and Reference of a Proper Name,\" following Michael Dummett, who argued that Frege's notion of sense should not be equated with a description. Evans further developed this line, arguing that a sense without a referent was not possible. He and McDowell both take the line that Frege's discussion of empty names, and of the idea of sense without reference, are inconsistent, and that his apparent endorsement of descriptivism rests only on a small number of imprecise and perhaps offhand remarks. And both point to the power that the sense-reference distinction \"does\" have (i.e., to solve at least the first two problems), even if it is not given a descriptivist reading.\n\nAs noted above, translators of Frege have rendered the German \"Bedeutung\" in various ways. The term 'reference' has been the most widely adopted, but this fails to capture the meaning of the original German ('meaning' or 'significance'), and does not reflect the decision to standardise key terms across different editions of Frege's works published by Blackwell. The decision was based on the principle of exegetical neutrality, namely that 'if at any point in a text there is a passage that raises for the native speaker legitimate questions of exegesis, then, if at all possible, a translator should strive to confront the reader of his version with the same questions of exegesis and not produce a version which in his mind resolves those questions'. The term 'meaning' best captures the standard German meaning of \"Bedeutung\", and Frege's own use of the term sounds as odd when translated into English as it does in German. Moreover, 'meaning' captures Frege's early use of \"Bedeutung\" well, and it would be problematic to translate Frege's early use as 'meaning' and his later use as 'reference', suggesting a change in terminology not evident in the original German.\n\nThe Greek philosopher Antisthenes, a pupil of Socrates, apparently distinguished \"a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance” from “a particular object of extensional reference.\" This \"suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference.\" \nThe principal basis of this claim is a quotation in Alexander of Aphrodisias's “Comments on Aristotle's 'Topics'” with a three-way distinction: \n\nThe sense-reference distinction is commonly confused with that between connotation and denotation, which originates with John Stuart Mill. According to Mill, a common term like 'white' \"denotes\" all white things, as snow, paper. But according to Frege, a common term does not refer to any individual white thing, but rather to an abstract Concept (\"Begriff\"). We must distinguish between the relation of reference, which holds between a proper name and the object it refers to, such as between the name 'Earth', and the planet Earth, and the relation of 'falling under', such as when the Earth falls under the concept \"planet\". The relation of a proper name to the object it designates is direct, whereas a word like 'planet' has no such direct relation at all to the Earth at all, but only to a concept that the Earth falls under. Moreover, judging \"of\" anything that it falls under this concept is not in any way part of our knowledge of what the word 'planet' means. The distinction between connotation and denotation is closer to that between Concept and Object, than to that between 'sense' and 'reference'.\n\n"}
{"id": "4618892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4618892", "title": "Serosorting", "text": "Serosorting\n\nSerosorting, also known as \"serodiscrimination\", is the practice of using HIV status as a decision-making point in choosing sexual behavior. Frequently the term is used to describe the behavior of a person who chooses a sexual partner assumed to be of the same HIV serostatus in order to engage in unprotected sex with them for a reduced risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV/AIDS.\n\nKnowledge of HIV status is based on the result of a person's HIV test, with a positive result indicating that a person has HIV, and can potentially transmit the disease to others during any sexual contact involving an exchange of bodily fluids (e.g., unprotected anal or vaginal sex). There are many situations where determining their partner's serostatus outside of clinical settings cannot be done \"with complete certainty\", limiting the efficacy in mitigating the transmission of HIV/AIDS (or other STDs). As people do not typically engage in sex practices with the expectation of contracting or transmitting HIV, failed attempts at serosorting are a leading cause of the contraction of HIV among partners.\n\nThe word serosorting comes from the Latin word \"serum\", which refers to blood serum. Sorting refers to choosing partners based on HIV status, which can be determined from blood tests, among other methods. Serodiscordant sex refers to sex between an HIV-positive person and an HIV-negative person; typically partners practicing serosorting make an attempt to find someone with a matching HIV test result, otherwise known as a seroconcordant partner.\n\nFailure to accurately determine HIV status may stem from people not being sure of their true HIV status (or not admitting to having HIV)—even a recent negative result from an HIV test may not be definitive of a person's serostatus, because if they are still within the window period following a recent infection, the antibodies that the blood tests measure will not be present yet. In addition, testing negative for HIV does not guarantee that they are free of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as HPV or hepatitis B.\n\nHowever, the largest experiment with serosorting has been conducted in the adult film industry by the Adult Industry Medical Healthcare Foundation. The Adult Industry Medical testing program, or AIM, eliminates virtually all possibility of lying and enforces a high frequency of testing for a variety of STDs that can make the transmission of HIV more likely. All actors in legitimate adult films are tested twice a year for herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, hepatitis types A, B and C, and HIV—as well as monthly for HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Before this program of testing, adult film actors had a very high rate of STDs, but now have only a 20% higher rate of STDs than the general public.\n\nDr. Matthew Golden of King County Public Health, in Washington, conducted a study with sexually active West Coast men and concluded that the patient population did demonstrate limited protection from HIV by serosorting. In his study, 3.5% of the men that used neither condoms nor serosorting became HIV-positive, as compared to 2.6% of the men that practiced serosorting alone, and 1.5% of the men who reported consistent condom use without serosorting.\n\nGolden's population differs from AIM's in that anal sex made up a high proportion of the subjects' sexual habits, their testing intervals were typically longer and less regular, there were no tests for STDs other than HIV, such as chlamydia (an important factor considering other STDs may hasten the spread of the virus), and there were no protections against falsely reporting any of the results. Golden's study did not cover the use of serosorting combined with condoms—which, theoretically, would be more effective than either precaution used separately.\n\nSerosorting does not fully protect against all STDs during unprotected sex between two people infected with HIV. Infection with \"one\" strain of HIV does not preclude later infection with \"another\" strain. There is a great deal of genetic variability within individual HIV populations, because this variability is shuffled and mutated every time the virus (numbering in the millions) reproduces inside the infected person's body. Modern drug cocktails keep virus and mutation levels low but eventually drug resistance will develop. Unprotected sex between two individuals positive for HIV still presents the risk of one of them—with a relatively less aggressive strain of the virus—exchanging genetic sequences with their partner's more drug-resistant cousin, and becoming harder to treat. Furthermore, dual infection has been associated with a more rapid progression towards developing AIDS.\n\nStudies have shown that serosorting provides some limited decrease in risk of contracting HIV among Men who have sex with men (MSMs) who use it as an HIV risk reduction technique.\n\nIt has been seen as controversial in being used to engage in sexual activities without regard to safer sex practices, as either participants were free of HIV or were already carriers. Although the practice has occurred informally since the AIDS pandemic began, serosorting has become more prevalent with online social networking sites now facilitating interactions, and even some health professionals citing harm reduction concepts for gay men as a measure to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection.\n\nThere has been further evolution on the idea of serosorting since the introduction of home-based rapid result tests. Prior to engaging in unprotected sex the two partners get tested together. If the immediate results are concordant they choose to have unprotected sex; while if the result is discordant condoms are used.\n\nBarebacking, or having male-to-male anal sex without using a condom, first became articulated in magazines such as POZ in 1995–96 as a practice taking place among HIV-positive men, and may be seen as an early articulation of serosorting.\n\n\n"}

Stanton Evans and adopted on September 11, 1960, the statement is named for the location of the inaugural meeting of Young Americans for Freedom, held at William F. Buckley, Jr.'s estate in Sharon, Connecticut.\n\nIn the late 1950s conservative students on college campuses campaigned for policies to combat communism. Many of these students became supporters of Barry Goldwater's 1960 campaign for the GOP vice-presidential nomination. At the Republican National Convention, Goldwater, failing to secure the nomination, challenged attendees saying: \"Let’s grow up conservatives. If you want to take the party back, then let’s get to work!\" In response, a meeting was organized at the home of William F. Buckley in Sharon, Connecticut.\nIn attendance at the Sharon Conference were about 90 students from 44 universities located in 24 states. Amongst the attendees were several future conservative leaders including historian Lee Edwards, Howard Phillips, Don Lipsett (co-founder Philadelphia Society), Paul Niemeyer (United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit), \"National Review\" publisher William A. Rusher (\"National Review\" publisher), Allan Ryskind (publisher of \"Human Events\") and M. Stanton Evans. It was decided to organize a new organization which was named the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). Evans was selected to draft the founding principles of the group, named Sharon Statement after Buckley's residence. Evans said he was influenced by the works of conservative thinkers such as F. A. Hayek, Russell Kirk, William F. Buckley Jr., and Whittaker Chambers.\n\nThe Sharon Statement consists of 400 words. It's an expression of \"National Review\" editor Frank Meyer’s \"fusionism,\" described as a combination of traditional conservatism, libertarianism and anti-communism, the three prevailing variants of conservatism at the time. The inclusion of \"God\" in the document was controversial. The statement begins with the statement \"“foremost among the transcendent values is the individual’s use of his God-given free will.\" It then proceeds to espouse five core principles which have directed the conservative movement since its adoption:\n\n\nTwo years later, in 1962, Tom Hayden wrote the Port Huron Statement. The manifesto for Students for a Democratic Society has been called the left's response to the Sharon Statement.\n\nIn 2010, fifty years after the adoption of the Sharon Statement, the Mount Vernon Statement was written. The Mount Vernon Statement shares the same sentiment of the Sharon Statement. However where Sharon focuses on the \"outworkings of liberty and self-government\", Mount Vernon emphasizes a principle from the Declaration of Independence: that human freedom is based on \"the laws of nature and nature’s God.\"\n\nIn a 2010 interview, Evans reflected on the impact of the Sharon Statement attributing the document and the movement it spawned to the fall of the Soviet Union while failing to address the \"domestic spending issue\" and “cultural issues, educational issues.\"\n\nIn his obituary of Evans journalist Adam Clymer called it a \"seminal document\" in the establishment of the conservative movement.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation described the Sharon Statement as \"statement is a succinct summary of the central ideas of modern American conservatism\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26689", "title": "Swedish language", "text": "Swedish language\n\nSwedish ( ) is a North Germanic language spoken natively by 9.6 million people, predominantly in Sweden (as the sole official language), and in parts of Finland, where it has equal legal standing with Finnish. It is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and to some extent with Danish, although the degree of mutual intelligibility is largely dependent on the dialect and accent of the speaker. Both Norwegian and Danish are generally easier for Swedish speakers to read than to listen to because of difference in accent and tone when speaking. Swedish is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Era. It has the most speakers of the North Germanic languages. \n\nStandard Swedish, spoken by most Swedes, is the national language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century. While distinct regional varieties descending from the older rural dialects still exist, the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized.\n\nThe standard word order is, as in most Germanic languages, V2, which means that the finite verb (V) appears in the second position (2) of a declarative main clause. Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. Swedish has two genders and is generally seen to have two grammatical cases – nominative and genitive (except for pronouns that, as in English, also are inflected in the object form) – although it is debated if the genitive in Swedish should be seen as a genitive case, or just the nominative plus the so-called genitive \"s\", then seen as a clitic. Swedish has two grammatical numbers – plural and singular. Adjectives have discrete comparative and superlative forms, and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, a highly variable consonant phoneme. \n\nSweden has also had historic use in Estonia, although the current status of the Estonian Swedish speakers is almost extinct. Instead it is used in the Swedish diaspora most notably in Oslo, Norway with more than 50,000 resident Swedes.\n\nSwedish is an Indo-European language belonging to the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages. In the established classification, it belongs to the East Scandinavian languages, together with Danish, separating it from the West Scandinavian languages, consisting of Faroese, Icelandic, and Norwegian. However, more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups: \"Insular Scandinavian\" (Faroese and Icelandic), and \"Continental Scandinavian\" (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), based on mutual intelligibility due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian (particularly Danish) on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both Faroese and Icelandic.\n\nBy many general criteria of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages could very well be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland, and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.\n\nIn the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, Proto-Norse, evolved into Old Norse. This language underwent more changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, which resulted in the appearance of two similar dialects: \"Old West Norse\" (Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland) and \"Old East Norse\" (Denmark and Sweden). The dialects of Old East Norse spoken in Sweden are called \"Runic Swedish\", while the dialects of Denmark are referred to as \"Runic Danish\". The dialects are described as \"runic\" because the main body of text appears in the runic alphabet. Unlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the Elder Futhark alphabet, Old Norse was written with the Younger Futhark alphabet, which had only 16 letters. Because the number of runes was limited, some runes were used for a range of phonemes, such as the rune for the vowel \"u\", which was also used for the vowels \"o\", \"ø\" and \"y\", and the rune for \"i\", also used for \"e\".\n\nFrom 1200 onwards, the dialects in Denmark began to diverge from those of Sweden. The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries, or isoglosses, ranging from Zealand in the south to Norrland, Österbotten and northwestern Finland in the north.\n\nAn early change that separated Runic Danish from the other dialects of Old East Norse was the change of the diphthong \"æi\" to the monophthong \"é\", as in \"stæinn\" to \"sténn\" \"stone\". This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read \"stain\" and the later \"stin\". There was also a change of \"au\" as in \"dauðr\" into a long open \"ø\" as in \"døðr\" \"dead\". This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from \"tauþr\" into \"tuþr\". Moreover, the \"øy\" diphthong changed into a long, close \"ø\", as in the Old Norse word for \"island\". By the end of the period, these innovations had affected most of the Runic Swedish-speaking area as well, with the exception of the dialects spoken north and east of Mälardalen where the diphthongs still exist in remote areas.\n\nOld Swedish (Swedish: \"fornsvenska\") is the term used for the medieval Swedish language. The start date is usually set to 1225 since this is the year that \"Västgötalagen\" (\"the Västgöta Law\") is believed to have been compiled for the first time. It is among the most important documents of the period written in Latin script and the oldest Swedish law codes. Old Swedish is divided into \"äldre fornsvenska\" (1225–1375) and \"yngre fornsvenska\" (1375–1526), \"older\" and \"younger\" Old Swedish. Important outside influences during this time came with the firm establishment of the Christian church and various monastic orders, introducing many Greek and Latin loanwords. With the rise of Hanseatic power in the late 13th and early 14th century, Middle Low German became very influential. The Hanseatic league provided Swedish commerce and administration with a large number of Low German-speaking immigrants. Many became quite influential members of Swedish medieval society, and brought terms from their native languages into the vocabulary. Besides a great number of loanwords for such areas as warfare, trade and administration, general grammatical suffixes and even conjunctions were imported. The League also brought a certain measure of influence from Danish (at the time much more similar than today's language).\n\nEarly Old Swedish was markedly different from the modern language in that it had a more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a \"common gender\" with the definite suffix \"-en\" and the definite article \"den\", in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents \"-et\" and \"det\". The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.\n\nA transitional change of the Latin script in the Nordic countries was to spell the letter combination \"ae\" as æ – and sometimes as a' – though it varied between persons and regions. The combination \"ao\" was similarly rendered a, and \"oe\" became o. These three were later to evolve into the separate letters ä, å and ö. The first time the new letters were used in print was in \"Aff dyäffwlsens frästilse\" (\"By the Devil's temptation\") published by Johan Gerson in 1495.\n\nModern Swedish (Swedish: \"nysvenska\") begins with the advent of the printing press and the European Reformation. After assuming power, the new monarch Gustav Vasa ordered a Swedish translation of the Bible. The New Testament was published in 1526, followed by a full Bible translation in 1541, usually referred to as the \"Gustav Vasa Bible\", a translation deemed so successful and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917. The main translators were Laurentius Andreæ and the brothers Laurentius and Olaus Petri.\n\nThe Vasa Bible is often considered to be a reasonable compromise between old and new; while not adhering to the colloquial spoken language of its day, it was not overly conservative in its use of archaic forms. It was a major step towards a more consistent Swedish orthography. It established the use of the vowels \"å\", \"ä\", and \"ö\", and the spelling \"ck\" in place of \"kk\", distinguishing it clearly from the Danish Bible, perhaps intentionally, given the ongoing rivalry between the countries. All three translators came from central Sweden which is generally seen as adding specific Central Swedish features to the new Bible.\n\nThough it might seem as if the Bible translation set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during the remainder of the century. It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. Capitalization during this time was not standardized. It depended on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface (often antiqua).\n\nSome important changes in sound during the Modern Swedish period were the gradual assimilation of several different consonant clusters into the fricative and later into . There was also the gradual softening of and into and the fricative before front vowels. The velar fricative was also transformed into the corresponding plosive .\n\nThe period that includes Swedish as it is spoken today is termed \"nusvenska\" (lit., \"Now-Swedish\") in linguistics, and started in the last decades of the 19th century. It saw a democratization of the language with a less formal written form that approached the spoken one. The growth of a public school system also led to the evolution of so-called \"boksvenska\" (literally, \"book Swedish\"), especially among the working classes, where spelling to some extent influenced pronunciation, particularly in official contexts. With the industrialization and urbanization of Sweden well under way by the last decades of the 19th century, a new breed of authors made their mark on Swedish literature. Many scholars, politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the emerging national language, among them prolific authors like the poet Gustaf Fröding, Nobel laureate Selma Lagerlöf, and radical writer and playwright August Strindberg.\n\nIt was during the 20th century that a common, standardized national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography finally stabilized and became almost completely uniform, with some minor deviations, by the time of the spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.\n\nA very significant change in Swedish occurred in the late 1960s, with the so-called \"du-reformen\", \"the you-reform\". Previously, the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. The use of \"herr\" (\"Mr\" or \"Sir\"), \"fru\" (\"Mrs\" or \"Ma'am\") or \"fröken\" (\"Miss\") was considered the only acceptable way to begin conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. The fact that the listener should preferably be referred to in the third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society. In the early 20th century, an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with \"ni\"—the standard second person plural pronoun)—analogous to the French \"vous\". (Cf. T-V distinction.) \"Ni\" wound up being used as a slightly less familiar form of \"du\", the singular second person pronoun, used to address people of lower social status. With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 1960s, these class distinctions became less important, and \"du\" became the standard, even in formal and official contexts. Though the reform was not an act of any centralized political decree, but rather the result of sweeping change in social attitudes, it was completed in just a few years, from the late 1960s to early 1970s. The use of \"ni\" as a polite form of address is sometimes encountered today in both the written and spoken language, particularly among older speakers.\n\nSwedish is the sole official national language of Sweden, and one of two in Finland (alongside Finnish). As of 2006, it was the first or sole native language of 7.5 to 8 million Swedish residents. In 2007 around 5.5% (c. 290,000) of the population of Finland were native speakers of Swedish, partially due to a decline following the Russian annexation of Finland after the Finnish War 1808–1809. The Finland Swedish minority is concentrated in the coastal areas and archipelagos of southern and western Finland. In some of these areas, Swedish is the predominant language; in 19 municipalities, 16 of which are located in Åland, Swedish is the sole official language. Åland county is an autonomous region of Finland.\n\nAccording to a rough estimation, as of 2010 there were up to 300,000 Swedish-speakers living outside Sweden and Finland. The largest populations were in the United States (up to 100,000), the UK, Spain and Germany (c. 30,000 each) and a large proportion of the remaining 100,000 in the Scandinavian countries, France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia. Over 3 million people speak Swedish as a second language, with about 2,410,000 of those in Finland. According to a survey by the European Commission, 44% of respondents from Finland who did not have Swedish as a native language considered themselves to be proficient enough in Swedish to hold a conversation. Due to the close relation between the Scandinavian languages, a considerable proportion of speakers of Danish and especially Norwegian are able to understand Swedish.\n\nThere is considerable migration between the Nordic countries, but owing to the similarity between the cultures and languages (with the exception of Finnish), expatriates generally assimilate quickly and do not stand out as a group. According to the 2000 United States Census, some 67,000 people over the age of five were reported as Swedish speakers, though without any information on the degree of language proficiency. Similarly, there were 16,915 reported Swedish speakers in Canada from the 2001 census. Although there are no certain numbers, some 40,000 Swedes are estimated to live in the London area in the United Kingdom. Outside Sweden and Finland, there are about 40,000 active learners enrolled in Swedish language courses.\n\nSwedish is officially the main language of Sweden. Swedish is also one of two official languages of Finland. In Sweden, it has long been used in local and state government, and most of the educational system, but remained only a \"de facto\" primary language with no official status in law until 2009. A bill was proposed in 2005 that would have made Swedish an official language, but failed to pass by the narrowest possible margin (145–147) due to a pairing-off failure. A proposal for a broader language law, designating Swedish as the main language of the country and bolstering the status of the minority languages, was submitted by an expert committee to the Swedish Ministry of Culture in March 2008. It was subsequently enacted by the Riksdag, and entered into effect on 1 July 2009.\n\nSwedish is the sole official language of Åland (an autonomous province under the sovereignty of Finland), where the vast majority of the 26,000 inhabitants speak Swedish as a first language. In Finland as a whole, Swedish is one of the two \"national\" languages, with the same official status as Finnish (spoken by the majority) at the state level and an official language in some municipalities.\n\nSwedish is one of the official languages of the European Union, and one of the working languages of the Nordic Council. Under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries speaking Swedish have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for interpretation or translation costs.\n\nThe Swedish Language Council (\"Språkrådet\") is the regulator of Swedish in Sweden but does not attempt to enforce control of the language, as for instance the \"Académie française\" does for French. However, many organizations and agencies require the use of the council's publication \"Svenska skrivregler\" in official contexts, with it otherwise being regarded as a \"de facto\" orthographic standard. Among the many organizations that make up the Swedish Language Council, the Swedish Academy (established 1786) is arguably the most influential. Its primary instruments are the glossary \"Svenska Akademiens ordlista\" (\"SAOL\", currently in its 14th edition) and the dictionary \"Svenska Akademiens Ordbok\", in addition to various books on grammar, spelling and manuals of style. Although the dictionaries have a prescriptive element, they mainly describe current usage.\n\nIn Finland, a special branch of the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland has official status as the regulatory body for Swedish in Finland. Among its highest priorities is to maintain intelligibility with the language spoken in Sweden. It has published \"Finlandssvensk ordbok\", a dictionary about the differences between Swedish in Finland and Sweden.\n\nFrom the 13th to 20th century, there were Swedish-speaking communities in Estonia, particularly on the islands (e. g., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in Swedish, known as \"Dagö\", \"Ormsö\", \"Runö\", respectively) along the coast of the Baltic, communities which today have all disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine, where they founded a village, \"Gammalsvenskby\" (\"Old Swedish Village\"). A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.\n\nFrom 1918–1940, when Estonia was independent, the small Swedish community was well treated. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, used Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden before the end of World War II, that is, before the invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944. Only a handful of speakers remain.\n\nSwedish dialects have either 17 or 18 vowel phonemes, 9 long and 9 short. As in the other Germanic languages, including English, most long vowels are phonetically paired with one of the short vowels, and the pairs are such that the two vowels are of similar quality, but with the short vowel being slightly lower and slightly centralized. In contrast to e.g. Danish, which has only tense vowels, the short vowels are slightly more lax, but the tense vs. lax contrast is not nearly as pronounced as in English, German or Dutch. In most dialects, the short vowel sound pronounced or has merged with the short (transcribed in the chart below).\n\nThere are 18 consonant phonemes, two of which, and , vary considerably in pronunciation depending on the dialect and social status of the speaker. In many dialects, sequences of with a dental consonant result in retroflex consonants. has a guttural or \"French R\" pronunciation in the South Swedish dialects; consequently, these dialects lack retroflex consonants.\n\nAny stressed syllable carries one of two tones, which gives Swedish much of its characteristic sound. Prosody is often one of the most noticeable differences between dialects.\n\nSwedish nouns and adjectives are declined in genders as well as number. Nouns belong to one of two genders – common for the \"en\" form or neuter for the \"ett\" form – which also determine the declension of adjectives. For example, the word \"fisk\" (\"fish\") is a noun of common gender (\"en fisk\") and can have the following forms:\n\nThe definite singular form of a noun is created by adding a suffix (\"-en\", \"-n\", \"-et\" or \"-t\"), depending on its gender and if the noun ends in a vowel or not. The definite articles \"den\", \"det\", and \"de\" are used for variations to the definitiveness of a noun. They can double as demonstrative pronouns or demonstrative determiners when used with adverbs such as \"här\" (\"here\") or \"där\" (\"there\") to form \"den/det här (can also be \"denna/detta\")\" (\"this\"), \"de här (can also be \"dessa\")\" (\"these\"), \"den/det där\" (\"that\"), and \"de där\" (\"those\"). For example, \"den där fisken\" means \"that fish\" and refers to a specific fish; \"den fisken\" is less definite and means \"that fish\" in a more abstract sense, such as that set of fish; while \"fisken\" means \"the fish\". In certain cases, the definite form indicates possession, e. g., \"jag måste tvätta håret\" (\"I must wash \"my\" hair\").\n\nAdjectives are inflected in two declensions – indefinite and definite – and they must match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created by adding a suffix (\"-t\" or \"-a\") to the common form of the adjective, e. g., \"en grön stol\" (a green chair), \"ett grönt hus\" (a green house), and \"gröna stolar\" (\"green chairs\"). The definite form of an adjective is identical to the indefinite plural form, e. g., \"den gröna stolen\" (\"the green chair\"), \"det gröna huset\" (\"the green house\"), and \"de gröna stolarna\" (\"the green chairs\").\n\nSwedish pronouns are similar to those of English. Besides the two natural genders \"han\" and \"hon\" (\"he\" and \"she\"), there are also the two grammatical genders \"den\" and \"det\", usually termed common and neuter. Unlike the nouns, pronouns have an additional object form, derived from the old dative form. \"Hon\", for example, has the following nominative, possessive, and object forms:\n\nSwedish also uses third-person possessive reflexive pronouns that refer to the subject in a clause, a trait which is restricted to North Germanic languages:\n\nSwedish used to have genitive that was placed at the end of the head of a noun phrase. In modern Swedish, it has become an enclitic \"-s\", which attaches to the end of the noun phrase, rather than the noun itself.\n\nIn formal written language, it used to be considered correct to place the genitive \"-s\" after the head of the noun phrase (\"hästen\"), though this is today considered dated, and different grammatical constructions are often used.\n\nVerbs are conjugated according to tense. One group of verbs (the ones ending in \"-er\" in present tense) has a special imperative form (generally the verb stem), but with most verbs the imperative is identical to the infinitive form. Perfect and present participles as adjectival verbs are very common:\n\nIn contrast to English and many other languages, Swedish does not use the perfect participle to form the present perfect and past perfect. Rather, the auxiliary verb \"har\" (\"have\"), \"hade\" (\"had\") is followed by a special form, called supine, used solely for this purpose (although often identical to the neuter form of the perfect participle):\n\nWhen building the compound passive voice using the verb \"att bli\", the past participle is used:\n\nThere exists also an inflected passive voice formed by adding \"-s\", replacing the final \"r\" in the present tense:\n\nIn a subordinate clause, the auxiliary \"har\" is optional and often omitted, particularly in written Swedish.\n\nSubjunctive mood is occasionally used for some verbs, but its use is in sharp decline and few speakers perceive the handful of commonly used verbs (as for instance: \"vore, månne\") as separate conjugations, most of them remaining only as set of idiomatic expressions.\n\nWhere other languages may use grammatical cases, Swedish uses numerous prepositions, similar to those found in English. As in modern German, prepositions formerly determined case in Swedish, but this feature can only be found in certain idiomatic expressions like \"till fots\" (\"on foot\", genitive).\n\nAs Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows similarities to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs and adverbial phrases, and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually placed at the beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify. Verb-second (inverted) word order is also used for questions.\n\nThe vocabulary of Swedish is mainly Germanic, either through common Germanic heritage or through loans from German, Middle Low German, and to some extent, English. Examples of Germanic words in Swedish are \"mus\" (\"mouse\"), \"kung\" (\"king\"), and \"gås\" (\"goose\"). A significant part of the religious and scientific vocabulary is of Latin or Greek origin, often borrowed from French and, lately, English. Some 1–200 words are also borrowed from Scandoromani or Romani, often as slang varieties; a commonly used word from Romani is \"tjej\" (\"girl\").\n\nA large number of French words were imported into Sweden around the 18th century. These words have been transcribed to the Swedish spelling system and are therefore pronounced recognizably to a French-speaker. Most of them are distinguished by a \"French accent\", characterized by emphasis on the last syllable. For example, \"nivå\" (fr. \"niveau\", \"level\"), \"fåtölj\" (fr. \"fauteuil\", \"armchair\") and \"affär\" (\"shop; affair\"), etc. Cross-borrowing from other Germanic languages has also been common, at first from Middle Low German, the lingua franca of the Hanseatic league and later from Standard German. Some compounds are translations of the elements (calques) of German original compounds into Swedish, like ' from German ' (\"cotton\"; literally, \"tree-wool\").\n\nAs with many Germanic languages, new words can be formed by compounding, e. g., nouns like ' (\"nail polish remover\") or verbs like ' (\"to eavesdrop\"). Compound nouns take their gender from the head, which in Swedish is always the last morpheme. New words can also be coined by derivation from other established words, such as the verbification of nouns by the adding of the suffix \"-a\", as in ' (\"car\") and ' (\"travel (recreationally) by car\"). The opposite, making nouns of verbs, is also possible, as in ' (\"way of thinking; concept\") from ' (\"to think\").\n\nThe Swedish alphabet is a 29-letter alphabet, using the 26-letter ISO basic Latin alphabet plus the three additional letters \"Å\"/\"å\", \"Ä\"/\"ä\", and \"Ö\"/\"ö\" constructed in the 16th century by writing \"o\" and \"e\" on top of an \"a\", and an \"e\" on top of an \"o\". Though these combinations are historically modified versions of A and O according to the English range of usage for the term diacritic, these three characters are not considered to be diacritics within the Swedish application, but rather separate letters, and are independent letters following \"z\". Before the release of the 13th edition of \"Svenska Akademiens ordlista\" in April 2006, \"w\" was treated as merely a variant of \"v\" used only in names (such as \"Wallenberg\") and foreign words (\"bowling\"), and so was both sorted and pronounced as a \"v\". Other diacritics (to use the broader English term usage referenced here) are unusual in Swedish; é is sometimes used to indicate that the stress falls on a terminal syllable containing \"e\", especially when the stress changes the meaning (\"ide\" vs. \"idé\", \"winter lair\" vs. \"idea\") as well as in some names, like \"Kastrén\"; occasionally other acute accents and, less often, grave accents can be seen in names and some foreign words. The letter à is used to refer to unit cost (a loan from the French), equivalent to the at sign (@) in English.\n\nThe German \"ü\" is treated as a variant of \"y\" and sometimes retained in foreign names and words, e. g., \"müsli\" (\"muesli/granola\"). A proper diaeresis may very exceptionally be seen in elaborated style (for instance: \"Aïda\"). The German convention of writing \"ä\" and \"ö\" as \"ae\" and \"oe\" if the characters are unavailable is an unusual convention for speakers of modern Swedish. Despite the availability of all these characters in the Swedish national top-level Internet domain and other such domains, Swedish sites are frequently labelled using \"a\" and \"o\", based on visual similarity, though Swedish domains could be registered using the characters å, ä, and ö from 2003.\n\nIn Swedish orthography, the colon is used in a similar manner as in English, with some exceptions: the colon is used for some abbreviations, such as \"3:e\" for \"tredje\" (\"third\") and \"S:t\" for \"Sankt\" (\"Saint\"), and for all types of endings that can be added to numbers, letters and abbreviations, such as \"a:et\" (\"the a\") and \"CD:n\" (\"the CD\"), or the genitive form \"USA:s\" (\"USA's\").\n\nAccording to a traditional division of Swedish dialects, there are six main groups of dialects:\n\nThe traditional definition of a Swedish dialect has been a local variant that has not been heavily influenced by the standard language and that can trace a separate development all the way back to Old Norse. Many of the genuine rural dialects, such as those of Orsa in Dalarna or Närpes in Österbotten, have very distinct phonetic and grammatical features, such as plural forms of verbs or archaic case inflections. These dialects can be near-incomprehensible to a majority of Swedes, and most of their speakers are also fluent in Standard Swedish. The different dialects are often so localized that they are limited to individual parishes and are referred to by Swedish linguists as \"sockenmål\" (lit., \"parish speech\"). They are generally separated into six major groups, with common characteristics of prosody, grammar and vocabulary. One or several examples from each group are given here. Though each example is intended to be also representative of the nearby dialects, the actual number of dialects is several hundred if each individual community is considered separately.\n\nThis type of classification, however, is based on a somewhat romanticized nationalist view of ethnicity and language. The idea that only rural variants of Swedish should be considered \"genuine\" is not generally accepted by modern scholars. No dialects, no matter how remote or obscure, remained unchanged or undisturbed by a minimum of influences from surrounding dialects or the standard language, especially not from the late 19th century onwards with the advent of mass media and advanced forms of transport. The differences are today more accurately described by a scale that runs from \"standard language\" to \"rural dialect\" where the speech even of the same person may vary from one extreme to the other depending on the situation. All Swedish dialects with the exception of the highly diverging forms of speech in Dalarna, Norrbotten and, to some extent, Gotland can be considered to be part of a common, mutually intelligible dialect continuum. This continuum may also include Norwegian and some Danish dialects.\n\nThe samples linked below have been taken from SweDia, a research project on Swedish modern dialects available for download (though with information in Swedish only), with many more samples from 100 different dialects with recordings from four different speakers: older female, older male, younger female and younger male. The dialect groups are those traditionally used by dialectologists.\n\nStandard Swedish is the language used by virtually all Swedes and most Swedish-speaking Finns. It is called \"rikssvenska\" or \"standardsvenska\" (\"Standard Swedish\") in Sweden. In Finland, \"högsvenska\" (\"High Swedish\") is used for the Finnish variant of standard Swedish and \"rikssvenska\" refers to Swedish as spoken in Sweden in general.\n\nIn a poll conducted in 2005 by the Swedish Retail Institute (\"Handelns Utredningsinstitut\"), the attitudes of Swedes to the use of certain dialects by salesmen revealed that 54% believed that \"rikssvenska\" was the variety they would prefer to hear when speaking with salesmen over the phone, even though dialects such as \"gotländska\" or \"skånska\" were provided as alternatives in the poll.\n\nFinland was a part of Sweden from the 13th century until the loss of the Finnish territories to Russia in 1809. Swedish was the sole administrative language until 1902 as well as the dominant language of culture and education until Finnish independence in 1917. The percentage of Swedish speakers in Finland has steadily decreased since then. The Swedish-speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Ostrobothnia, Southwest Finland and Nyland where the percentage of Finland Swedes partly is high, with Swedish being spoken by more than 90% of the population in several municipalities, and on Åland, where Swedish is spoken by a vast majority of the population and is the only official language. Swedish is an official language also in the rest of Finland, though, with the same official status as Finnish. The country's public broadcaster, Yle, provides two Swedish-language radio stations, Yle Vega and Yle X3M, as well a TV channel, Yle Fem.\n\nRinkeby Swedish (after Rinkeby, a suburb of northern Stockholm with a large immigrant population) is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken by young people of foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. These varieties could alternatively be classified as sociolects, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers. However, some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård Swedish (after Rosengård in Malmö), a variant of Scanian. A survey made by the Swedish linguist Ulla-Britt Kotsinas showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm. The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech of a boy speaking Rinkeby Swedish whose parents were both Swedish; only 1.8% guessed his native language correctly.\nExcerpt from \"Barfotabarn\" (1933), by Nils Ferlin (1898–1961):\n\n\n\n"}

It was first used by Nikolai Gogol in the novel The \"Dead Souls\" first published in 1842. The expression is used as a joke, sometimes irony indicating the often fictitious place of well-being, where a person who is not burdened with routine, rests, leads a carefree, unladen, and idle lifestyle.\n\nThe \"Dead Souls\" were written by the author while residing mostly abroad, mainly in Italy and Germany, but also in France, Switzerland, and Austria. In one of the lyrical digressions of the novel in the second chapter of the first volume of The \"Dead Souls\", the author exclaims: \"Rus'! Rus’! It's you that I see, from my wonderful, \"beautiful afar\", I see YOU.\" These lines were written by a writer while living in Italy. By self-admission, Gogol loved Italy and called it 'my dear soul', in a letter to Zhukovsky he writes: \"If you knew with what joy I abandoned Switzerland and flew to my dear soul - Italy. She is mine! No one in the world will take her from me.\"\n\nAs an idiomatic expression, \"The Beautiful Afar\" was first coined by Vissarion Belinsky, in the argument against Nikolai Gogol himself.

{"id": "54118843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54118843", "title": "The Superstar Effect", "text": "The Superstar Effect\n\nThe Superstar Effect or \"Tiger Woods effect\" refers to the change in performance caused by the presence of a highly ranked player - a superstar - in a rank-order competition.\n\nThe phenomenon was first described in a study titled \"Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars\" by Jennifer Brown, which examined the performance of golfers at events with and without Tiger Woods. In contradiction to what intuition would suggest (namely that increased rivalry encourages better performance), Brown finds that the presence of a superstar is in fact associated with reduced competitor’s efforts in rank-order tournaments. The explanation she provides is an economic model in which competing is costly - one might hurt themselves, for instance - thus when the chance of winning is very low, the participant is discouraged from performing to her best abilities as it is not worthwhile.\n\nThe study uses data from the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) that contains round-by-round scores for all players in every tournament from 1999 to 2006 and hole-by-hole results for all events from 2002 to 2006. During this period, golfer Tiger Woods was performing significantly better than any other player with scores in regular and major events being lower than the group mean in all years except 2004. His consistent and dominant performance has earned him the title of superstar. Hence, the data is filtered creating a subset of tournaments Tiger Woods was a part of and other players’ performance is compared to when they are competing against Woods to when they are not. The analysis yields that on events when the highly skilled golfers were competing against Tiger Woods, their performance was considerably worse - with scores almost one stroke higher on average - than on events where Tiger Woods was absent. On the other hand, lower-ranked golfers are less or not at all affected by his presence. Brown notes that this could be due to the fact that the stakes are not as high for lower-ranked golfers to start with.\n\nBrown investigates the possibility of other explanations as to why golfers’ performance is poorer but finds that it is neither due to players taking more risks nor is the other players’ performance worse relative to Woods’ due to the fact that better golfers avoid competitions the superstar would be their opponent in. She also disperses the idea that it would be the increased media attention attributed to Woods’ presence that causes other players to produce lower results.\n\nFinally, Brown notes that superstars must in fact be in their ‘super’ stage of career to be able to create an adverse effect: in periods where Tiger Woods was not that successful (in years 2003-2004) golfers actually seem to have played better against him.\n\nThree years after Brown’s study, in 2010, a similar one was conducted in Japan by Ryuichi Tanaka and Kazutoshi Ishino. The writers look at how the presence of Japan golfer superstar Kazuo Ozaki affects the game of others and their findings are in accordance with those of the paper on Woods. Their results suggest that when having to compete against Ozaki, players perform worse by about 0.3 strokes on average.\n\nYet another research, published by Brian C. Hill in 2014, examines the same effect in 100-meter tournaments with Usain Bolt being the superstar on the field. Surprisingly, Hill finds a \"positive\" superstar effect, meaning that runners produce faster running times and the likelihood of setting a personal record is increased. Wanting to explain the results seemingly contradictory to that of Brown’s, Hill points out the simultaneous nature of running competitions (whereas in golf, players get to watch each other) and that a 100-meter race is about 10 seconds which does not leave competitors much time to alter their behaviour because of Bolt.\n\nThe importance of studying the dynamics of rank-order tournaments with heterogeneous competitors reaches beyond the world of sports. Numerous management strategies use competition as an incentive for better productivity, however, according to the superstar effect, if agents are to rival a superstar, they may in fact reduce their efforts.\n"}

{"id": "614505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=614505", "title": "Tibor Sekelj", "text": "Tibor Sekelj\n\nTibor Sekelj (14 February 1912 – 20 September 1988), also known as Székely Tibor according to Hungarian orthography, was a Hungarian born polyglot, explorer, author, and 'citizen of the world.' In 1986 he was elected a member of the Academy of Esperanto and an honorary member of the World Esperanto Association. Among his novels, travel books and essays, his novella \"Kumeŭaŭa, la filo de la ĝangalo\" (\"Kumewawa, the son of the jungle\"), a children's book about the life of Brazilian Indians, was translated into seventeen languages, and in 1987 it was voted best Children's book in Japan. In 2011 European Esperanto Union declared 2012 \"The Year of Tibor Sekelj\" to honor the 100-year anniversary of his birth.\n\nSekelj's father was a veterinarian, and as a result the family moved around extensively. Several months after Tibor's birth the family moved to Čenej (now in Serbia), where Tibor lived until he was ten years old. While Hungarian was his \"mother tongue\", the commonly spoken language was German. Sekelj had at least two sisters and a brother, Antonije, who later collaborated with him on several books. In 1922, the family settled in Kikinda, part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now in Serbia), where Tibor learned Serbo-Croatian. He also studied French and soon was teaching it to his fellow students. Sekelj went on to learn a new language every four years. In 1926 his family moved to Nikšić (now in Montenegro), where he took up gym, mountaineering and where he walked the entire length of Montenegro. In 1929 he entered the University of Zagreb (in Croatia) and in 1933 was one of the three youngest students to have graduated from the school of law. During that time Tibor also studied painting, sculpture, Esperanto, filmmaking and journalism. But the practice of law bored him, and he turned his attention to writing. He began working as a journalist in Zagreb. In 1937 he started to work in Zagreb as a film screenwriter. In 1982, in Leuven, Belgium, at the World Youth Esperanto Conference, he discussed his Sephardic Jewish ancestry with Neil Blonstein.\n\nStarting in 1939, Sekelj was a tireless globetrotter, and while he always returned to Serbia in between his many journeys, his need to explore new horizons melded with an insatiable curiosity about people. His travels and expeditions yielded books that have been translated into over twenty languages. \nIn 1939 he left Zagreb for Argentina to write an article on Croat exiles for a Zagreb newspaper \"Hrvatski Dnevnik\". Sekelj was on the ship Teresa on what might have been that ship's last voyage due to the start of World War II. In 1939 the other ships that normally traveled to South America from Rijeka-Fiume were being used by Italy due to the war in Africa. Setting sail from Rijeka (then Fiume in Italy), he headed for Buenos Aires, with stops in Naples, Genoa (Italy) Santos (Brazil), and Montevideo (Uruguay). Tibor reached Buenos Aires on August 19, 1939. A pacifist by nature, Sekelj had anticipated the outbreak of war and so chose to be far from the fighting. This difficult decision was due not to a lack of personal courage—Sekelj was known to display almost foolhardy bravery throughout his life—but because this Jewish Hungarian/world citizen was simply unwilling to hew to any ideology tied to military purposes.\n\nWithin two years he had honed his knowledge of Spanish and got work as a journalist, publishing a monthly magazine dedicated to travel and exploration. Sekelj remained in Argentina for the next 15 years, writing and exploring South America.\n\nIn 1944, with no prior mountaineering experience, Sekelj joined a crew on an ascent on Aconcagua, the highest mountain (m) in the South American continent., led by the Swiss German mountaineer Georg Link. Sekelj, the Austrian Zechner and the Italian Bertone reached the summit on February 13, 1944. But tragedy loomed: Four of the six men on that climb perished in a snowstorm. This terrible experience inspired Sekelj to write his first book: \"Storm Over Aconcagua\", which recounts the drama in thrilling detail. On a second climb—initiated by the Argentinian Army, which Tibor led—the corpses of the four young men were found and brought home. As a result, Sekelj added a chapter to the second edition of \"Tempestad sobre el Aconcagua, 1944\" in which he describes that adventure. Then Argentine President Juan Perón personally tried to award Sekelj honorary Argentine Citizenship for his actions, along with the Golden Condor the country's highest medal of honor. Tibor, in his gentle rejection of the offer of citizenship, stated that, while he deeply appreciated the offer, as a Citizen of the World, he could not be bound to any one country.\n\nBased on the success of his first book, Sekelj's publisher urged him to write a second, unrelated one. With a budget of two thousand dollars, Sekelj chose to explore uncharted regions of the Brazilian rainforests in Mato Grosso, otherwise known as the River of Death. In 1946 he undertook first of two expeditions into the Amazon jungle, which produced a popular book, \"Along Native Trails\" (Por Tierra De Indios). His partner on this arduous journey was an Argentinian of Russian descent Mary Reznik (1914–1996). Together they spent nearly a year exploring tribes along the Araguaia and Rio das Mortes Rivers. Along the way they survived contact with the fearsome Xavantes Indians, who had killed over a hundred people, in many expeditions before them. They also encountered the \"Karajá\" and \"Javae\" Indians on this expedition. Eventually the book \"Por Tierra de Indios\" (1946) chronicling survival in difficult circumstances, amid illness and near-starvation, met with great success, was reprinted repeatedly and translated into many languages. In 1946 Tibor and Mary married. Together they returned to the Amazon in 1948. After that expedition he penned \"Where Civilization Ends\" (\"Donde La Civilizacion Termina\").\n\nIn the summer of 1946, Tibor traveled through Patagonia with three companions : Zechner, Mary and Dr Rosa Scolnik. During the following years he audited classes at the University of Buenos Aires to attend lectures on anthropology, ethnology and archeology, in order to get useful knowledge for his upcoming expeditions.\n\nIn 1948 a failed expedition to find the Jivaros led Tibor and Mary to Bolivia, where they met with President Enrique Hertzog. He encouraged them to explore the unknown area of the River Itenez, which abuts with Brazil. During that difficult six-month-long journey they encountered more hardships and hostile Indians, among them the Tupari, a tribe that only a few years before had been practicing cannibals. In April 1949, President Hertzog of Brazil proposed that Sekelj should oversee a territory spanning one hundred thousand hectares, from the planned 4 millions of hectares meant to house a million European refugees. Sekelj, rather than having to wait for six months for parliament to render a decision, turned down the offer. He later regretted the missed opportunity to have a place where Esperanto could become the common language to its populace. In September 1949 Mary gave birth to a son, Diego Reinaldo Sekelj, whom Tibor named after a son of Christopher Columbus.\n\nAfter attending the World Congress of Esperanto in UK, Tibor spent seven months in Europe. He returned to South America, joining Mary in Venezuela. For the next seventeen months he wrote newspaper articles, while managing a musical instruments store in Maracaibo. After going to Caracas to oversee the creation of a series of historical murals, he began traveling through Central America on his own, as by this time he and Mary and separated. The couple formally divorced in 1955, and soon after Mary went to the United States, where she remarried. Their son, given her second husband's surname, is , Daniel Reinaldo Bernstein, a respected acupuncturist and musician living in New York City.\n\nTibor later wrote about being on the island of San Blas in Panama, where he engaged with the \"Kuna\" Indians; of an attempt to scale the volcano Izalko in El Salvador, that was cut short by a volcanic eruption; and of discovering the ruins of an ancient city in Honduras, which many people knew from legends only, and that was built by Indians. It was during these treks through Guatemala and Honduras that Sekelj became ever more immersed in archeology and anthropology.\n\nUpon Sekelj's arrival in Mexico in 1953, several alpine clubs invited him to take part in their treks. This was not unexpected, given the fact that his book \"« Tempestad sobre el Aconcagua »\" had practically become a manual for mountain climbing. He climbed Popocatépetl, Iztaccihuatl and many other volcanoes and mountains, further firming up his expertise in that arena. One of many fascinating explorations at that time was the underground crossing of the river San Heronimo, lying 14-km within the interior of mountain.\n\nIn 1954 Sekelj returned to his home in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He was given a warm welcome by the local government and its people, as much for his humanitarian message as for his fascinating travelogues. Along with his countless newspaper articles, his books were translated into Serbian, Slovenian, Hungarian, Albanian and Esperanto. He continued to travel and write of his experiences.\n\nIn 1956 he drove through Asia as a World Esperanto Association (UEA) observer to an upcoming UNESCO talk held in New Delhi. When his car crashed in Tehran he continued on by bus and rail. During that journey he met extensively with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, future prime minister Indira Gandhi. He also befriended the future president Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. In the Yugoslav embassy he met with Ljubomir Vukotić, then president of the World Federation of the Deaf When Vukotić met with Indian and Chinese representatives to open an Asian office, Seklelj acted as interpreter, bridging a communication gap between non-hearing people of different languages. In January 1957, he accompanied Vukotić to China, which at the time was not accepting visitors. This was followed by a six-month stay on the invitation of King Mahendra of Nepal, another country that was, at that time, hostile to foreigners. King Mahendra personally thanked Sekelj for founding the first people's university, and for helping to spread the teaching of Esperanto. This friendship is in part the subject of Tibor's book, \"« Nepal opens the door », 1959,\" which he first wrote in Esperanto while in Madras studying yoga philosophy. The book was translated into multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Serbian and Slovenian. His journey through India, on foot and by bus, led Tibor from village to village, and from temple to temple, culminating in a month-long stay in a cave with three Yogin.\n\nAfter spending six months in Europe Sekelj again flew to India, this time to teach Esperanto to the great Indian Mystic, Vinoba Bhave. The Hindu scholar mastered Esperanto within a month. Sekelj remained in India for five months before landing, penniless, in Japan. In March 1960, he set off on a four-month tour across 30 cities in Japan, always welcome at the home of Esperantists there. Between lecturing and writing newspaper articles, Sekelj earned enough money to buy an airplane ticket to Sri Lanka, and then to Israel before returning to his home base in Belgrade.\n\nIn 1961, Sekelj accepted the invitation of Moroccan Esperantists and traveled to Morocco, where he joined a caravan of Tuaregs nomads into the Sahara. In March 1962, Tibor set off for Africa on a \"Karavano de Amikeco\" (Caravan of Friendship), with eight people from four countries in two all-terrain cars. With a goal of direct communication between people, this yearlong journey reached Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. When a second caravan meant for other African countries failed to materialize, Tibor climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa. This trip is the theme of his book \"Ĝambo rafiki\". Although he wrote the book in Esperanto, it first appeared in the Slovenian language.\n\nIn 1965, on his way to the World Congress of Esperanto in Tokyo, Tibor traveled by train across Russia (Moscow) and Siberia (Irkutsk and Khabarovsk) to Nahodka, before landing in Yokohama by boat. A month later Tibor crossed Siberia by train, with a side trip to Mongolia. Given the antipathy to foreigners there, his three-month stay was difficult, despite having a stamped visa and correct documents. In ensuing years Tibor Sekelj managed to visit every European country, with the exception of Albania and Iceland.\n\nIn 1970, Yugoslav television sent Sekelj to Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea. During his six-month stay he climbed Mount Kosciuszko In New Guinea he met with natives whose lack of previous contact with the civilized world led to tense situations. But among Sekelj's many skills—and perhaps luck was just another one—was an uncanny ability to escape imminent danger time and again. Certainly he adapted easily to odd customs (including bizarre food), but if there was a single thing in particular that helped in this regard, it was his communication skills, which transcended even his facility with language.\n\nIn 1972, while at the international congress of ethnologists in Chicago Tibor visited eastern Canada and United States. In 1977, during the same event in Leningrad, he saw Uzbekistan and Central Asia. That same year he took part in a festival celebrating the culture of former slaves in Lagos (Nigeria). In 1978, during an assignment for Yugoslav TV, he returned to South America, where he visited Ecuador and the Galápagos Islands.\n\nWhat amazed many was how this tireless traveler always got funding for his travels. He famously attributed this ability to the fact that he did the work of seven: Writer; cameraman; assistant; photographer; and buyer and shipper of ethnographic artifacts. While each of these jobs is usually delegated to others, Sekelj was a one-man crew. Of course, one could have added 'Ad Man' to that list. Whenever it was possible, Tibor would wrangle advertising contracts from airlines in exchange for discounted tickets.\n\nSekelj devoted much of his life to the defense and promotion of Esperanto. A Committee member of UEA since 1946, he sought for over thirty years—with a brief break while skirmishing with Ivo Lapenna) over its activity within the Instituto por Oficialigo de Esperanto (IOE), to be part of all the universal Esperanto Congresses. And as a representative of the IDU—the International Committee for Ethnographic Museums—he took part in numerous conferences. Sekelj's polyglot abilities often assured that he alone could understand all of the multi-national speakers there.\n\nIn 1983, he co-founded EVA (Esperantist Writers Association and was its first president. In 1986 he was elected to be a member of the Academy of Esperanto.\n\nHe took every opportunity to advocate for Esperanto, particularly in the international Writers association PEN and at UNESCO. In 1985, during the 27th Conference in Sofia, Sekelj was commissioned by UEA to ensure that Unesco would draft a that would be favorable to Esperanto .\n\nIn 1972, he took a four-year job as head curator of the Municipal Museum in Subotica (Serbia – Vojvodina). In the later 1970s he took advanced studies in museology in Zagreb University leading to a doctorate (in 1976). His innovative ideas and projects found little support, and Sekelj quit his job almost immediately. He attended the World Congress of ethnographers in Chicago in the United States and the World congress of museum professionals in Copenhagen. Upon his election to Secretary of the International Committee of Museologists, he took on various initiatives for new kinds of museums with dioramas.\n\nIn 1985, Sekelj met a young woman Erzsébet Sekelj, a librarian, born in 1958, whom he met on a journey through Hungary. That year she learned Esperanto. Sekelj and Erzsébet married in 1987 in Osijek. Together they visited three World Congresses of Esperanto. Erzsébet Sekelj participated in the drafting of the vojvodina organ VELO. They jointly wanted to compile an Esperanto-Serbo-Croatian dictionary, which was never completed due to the death of Tibor.\n\nTibor lived in Subotica from 1972 until his death, September 20, 1988. He is buried in \"Bajsko groblje\" (Baja cemetery) in Subotica, with the highest honors from the city of Subotica. On his grave, under bronze bas-relief one can read that inscription in Esperanto: (WRITER, TRAVELER)\nTibor Sekelj was adroit at a wide range of skills: journalist, explorer, adventurer, mountaineer, writer, drawer, filmmaker, geographer, ethnologist, museologist, polyglot and actor on the political stage, relating to politicians including aforementioned heads of state. His defense and promotion of Esperanto at Unesco and mainly the UEA. The connecting thread in this man's world view was a consistent access to peoples from around the world.\n\nTraveling certainly helped make him a geographer, but he also was forced to become a true cartographer during his travels. In that regard he researched and designed charts of several previously uncharted parts of South America, especially in Bolivia and Brazil. As a result, a river was named after him: Rio Tibor. He published word maps in Esperanto and edited a professional review \"«Geografia Revuo»\" between 1956 and 1964. In 1950 he became a member of Guatemala society about history and geography and, because of his merits in this area, in 1946 the Royal Geographical Society of United Kingdom accepted him as an \"FRGS\".\n\nHe learned about journalism during his student years in Zagreb, where he became a correspondent for Croatian newspapers : one from them, \"Hrvatski Dnevnik\", sent him as his correspondent to Argentina, to do a report on Yugoslav emigrants, which is how he became a traveller. After two years he learned Spanish enough to self-publish, Buenos Aires, in Spanish language, monthly organ \"« Rutas »\" (Ways) a magazine dedicated to geography, journeys, tourism, explorations, etc.\n\nWorking as a journalist for an Argentinian newspaper, he decided to join a planned expedition to Aconcagua, the highest mountain of Americas (more than 7000 m according to contemporary ratings). For the most part he was able to support himself through writing, contributing to many newspapers, mainly in South America and Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia he contributed to many small newspapers, so that the younger generation learned about Esperanto through his articles in young people's periodicals. In his 60's he became a television journalist, filming a series of TV-reports for the Belgrade Television about the Caravan of Friendship (travel through Africa) for the Zagreb Television about exploring unknown tribes in Australia and New Guinea and for the Novi Sad Television about Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. He was also a brilliant journalist for Esperanto. Except contribution to many Esperanto-newspapers and organs he was chief editor during 8 years for the Geografia Revuo, E-Gazeto (initially IOE-Gazeto) of 1966–1972 (monthly organ – entirely appeared 65 editions) and VELO during six years (1983–1988 – Vojvodina Esperanto-newspaper).\n\n\"Geografia Revuo\" appeared between 1956 until 1964, each one volume yearly, except in 1959–1960 neither in 1962. The title-pages of exclusively all six volumes are of Sekelj, only in the 4th issue he left the place of the editorial to Aafke Haverman \"(\"Aviadile tra Afriko\")\" and laid his \"Kun la Ajnoj de Hokajdo\" in the central booklet. Looked at as entirety, \"Geografia Revuo\" is virtually personal periodical of Sekelj with some appendices of friends.\n\nHe lived chiefly on his work as a journalist (writing articles and stories for many various newspapers and organs) and filmmaker. There were 740 translations of his articles in newspapers and organs. We can say definitely that he was writing for many dozens of newspapers and magazines, mainly in Yugoslavia but also in Hungary, and various countries in South America—not to mention the periodicals in Esperanto. Of the 7500 speeches he gave, the majority centered around his journeys, although he spoke prolifically on many other topics as well.\n\nHe traveled through 90 countries and his books appeared in as many countries and a great many languages.\n\nTibor's first job after getting his Degree in Zagreb was with a film company, Merkurfilm. The company sent him to learn film production in Prague, where he studied under a famous Czech director Otokar Vavra where for 6 months Tibor studied film direction.\n\nOnce Sekelj returned to Yugoslavia in the 1960s, he began getting TV coverage as a journalist. And because his forays into unknown areas required more than just pictures—they required film—Tibor accepted the challenge. He began using his knowledge as a filmmaker, not only directing himself but also using sound and light, camera work and more on his trips to New Guinea and Australia. For Zagreb television he filmed a series of films about those regions and their natives that became a 10-hour-long travel film series seen across Yugoslavia. Amazingly, he did everything on those films alone. In the later part of the 1970s he made films about Colombia and Ecuador where he used a professional team of filmmakers from Novi Sad Television, which promoted his travel films.\n\nHe himself was the subject of many interviews, chiefly within former Yugoslav televisions. A large majority of that material has been preserved. One example is an in-depth, two-hour interview with TV journalist Hetrich.\n\nIn Argentina he learned about mountaineering with barely enough time to prepare before taking part in an expedition to Aconcagua. Still he was able to survive the climb up that treacherous mountain. Later on, he climbed a number of very dangerous mountains, and on all the continents, between the mountains of Nepal, Mexico and Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, and Mount Kosciuszko in Australia. His detailed description of the ascent on Aconcagua in a book in Spanish became a sort of textbook for mountaineering in Mexico, and other countries across South America.\n\nDuring his travels he became a collector of native masks, hats and musical instruments, along with spoken native poetry. Concerning the latter he published the book \"Elpafu la sagon\", that appeared in Serbocroatian and Esperanto. He donated his tangible collection of masks, instruments and hats to Ethnographic museum in Zagreb and to Municipal museum of Subotica, where most of them were later given to the museum of Senta (Serbia).\n\nAlthough his goal was never to impress others, the most attractive aspect of Tibor Sekelj's life in the eyes of the public—especially to the non-esperantist—was unarguably his adventurer side. Perhaps it was his ceaseless search to locate the essence of human spirit that led him to remote parts of the earth. Across a span of over forty years he studied, and engaged with, tribes from the rain forests of Brazil and New Guinea, always learning and annotating the customs, lifestyles and philosophies of then unknown peoples in Asia and Africa. Many times he befriended people otherwise hostile to the white man, and often risking his life in the process. He writes eruditely about this in his book in Esperanto \"\"Mondo de travivaĵoj\" (The world of experiences ), 1981.\"\n\nAmong Sekelj's many skills was an ability to create an instant sense of ease between himself and politicians and men in power. Score of heads of state welcomed him into their circle, and in turn he gave them useful advice based on his travels through their territories. During his life he met with various heads of State : From Juan Perón (Argentinian president) he received in 1946 an award, the Golden Condor, along with an offer of Argentinian citizenship due to his bravery on Aconcagua. He met with, and became a friend of, Jawaharlal Nehru (Indian prime minister) and his daughter Indira Gandhi (future Indian prime minister), and with Radhakrishnan (future Indian president). Bolivia president Enrique Hertzog sent him to do research in uncharted regions of Bolivia in 1948, and in 1949 asked him to manage Bolivian territory for European refugees after World War II, offering 100.000 hectares for him to do that. Tibor asked for 4 million, but was told it would take half year for the Bolivian parliament to ratify that. He chose not to wait and left before ratification could take place. Also he met with King Mahendra of Nepal, who thanked Tibor Sekelj for creating the first people's university there, where he taught Esperanto.\n\nThe peak of his political activity was in 1985 when he took over the UEA in order to prepare of UNESCO on Esperanto. He met with numerous heads of state, ministers and diplomats during his four participations in UNESCO-talks throughout 1984 and 1985. He finally succeeded in convincing the Yugoslavian government to offer that resolution to the Assembly of UNESCO in Sofia, while getting other Esperantists to work on the governments of China, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, San Marino and Costa Rica in order to back the resolution. Over the next months he visited the embassies of seven of those countries, finally succeeding in convincing them that they should work with their governments and accept the resolution. In Sofia he negotiated between the delegations of numerous countries to vote on the resolution, which in the end was accepted.\n\nTo all of this we can also add the few months he spent living with the Indian philosopher and political activist Vinoba Bhave, not to mention many, many heads of smaller regions and cities and states across the world.\n\nSekelj learned 25 languages and countless dialects, of which he retained nine at the end of his life: Hungarian, Serbian, German, Esperanto, Italian, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese. Of these he wrote extensively in Spanish, Esperanto and the Serbo-Croatian, He was an interpreter on his travels and as part of his work for PIF during acceptances, arrangements etc.\n\nAfter becoming an Esperantist in Zagreb in 1930, Sekelj remained committed to the ideals of the international language throughout his life. His contributions to the language are immense: Sekelj founded ten Esperanto-Associations in South America and Asia and Esperanto-societies in 50 of cities across the world.\n\nFor over twenty years Sekelj was a committee member of UEA and he was single-handedly responsible for the second resolution where UNESCO positively addressed Esperanto in 1985. One-third of his books were originally written in Esperanto. He wrote a great many lucid and cogent articles for various Esperanto-newspapers and magazines, and he drafted \"Geografia Revuo, E-Gazeto \"and\" Velo.\" But his intense activity in the name of Esperanto related to his foundation and guide of International Institute for Officialization of Esperanto (IOE) that launched the motto « better practice than 100-hours sermon » like this requiring more open activity of Esperantists. In that sense he especially engaged in diverse travel, organizing bus caravans that traveled across the world, having its greatest impact at the start of the International Puppet Theatre Festival (PIF) in Zagreb and later at the foundation for \"Internacia Kultura Servo\" (International Cultural Service). PIF still exists, currently after 44 years and still distributes an annual prize \"Tibor Sekelj\" for the most humanitarian message. His very intensive activity in the name of IOE had a strong effect on the classical neutral Esperanto-movement in the practical application, on the one hand in terms of culture and tourism and on the other to a more elastic conception of impartiality that followed TEJO.\n\nHis motto for success: \"Three things are essential for success: precisely define your goal, move steadily toward it, and persist until you have reached it.\"\n\nHe influenced the teaching of Esperanto, and was behind the launching of the first televised course in Esperanto in China. In the 1980s, he wrote textbooks. The authors were A. and T. Sekelj and Klas Aleksandar and Novak Koloman did the illustrations. The course existed also in form of transparencies – actually movies – one can project.\nHe led many Master Esperanto classes wherever he travelled and also took part in the improvement of the «Zagreb method» textbook. Tibor Sekelj gave between 7000 and 8000 speeches, most often with photos of his travels, wrote innumerable articles about Esperanto in the national press and was interviewed hundreds of times for national radios, newspapers and television. He always spoke about Esperanto.\n\nWherever he was, in his lectures and activities he conveyed to his audience his simple philosophy of life: man as an individual is the most precious thing in his own environment, regardless of descent or education. (This is most clearly expressed in his work \"Kumeŭaŭa\".) Man as a cultural capital is the product of all humanity, because in our daily lives we interact with products invented by diverse people; he illustrated this with a dining table, explaining that each piece of tableware was invented by a different people, each of the foods that had been developed and planted by different people, and now ten cultures are involved in setting a table. Therefore, every man was a respectable person, and what we have today is the result of efforts of all nations, and therefore belongs to all.\n\nAside from being an adept writer, Sekelj studied painting and sculptor while still a student in Zagreb. When he first landed in Argentina, he survived doing portraits and later he often illustrated his own books.\n\nTibor is perhaps the most well-known original Esperanto-writers among the non-esperantist world, given the number of his translated books from Esperanto. The most successful his work \"Kumewawa – the son of jungle\" has been translated multiple times, while others books have between two and ten translations. Writing in Esperanto, Spanish and Serbo-Croatian he produced some thirty works of travel writing, novels, stories and poetry.\n\nThe most successful of his books is « Kumewawa – the son of jungle » (originally written in Esperanto) translated into 22 languages. In 1983 the Japanese ministry for education proclaimed in 1983 as one from the 4 best juvenile literature published in Japan. As a result, it appeared in Japanese in 300.000 copies, probably the largest printing from an Esperanto-based document. In total, over a million copies of Kumewawa were printed throughout the world.\n\n\"Tempest above Aconcagua\" was a book that appealed across generations and to all parts of the world. His stories won prizes of Belartaj Konkursoj and his poetry, although sparse, is considered valuable and worth studying.\nThe works of Tibor Sekelj, novels and recordings of his travels, contain interesting ethnographic observations.

{"id": "29992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29992", "title": "Turkish language", "text": "Turkish language\n\nTurkish (), also referred to as Istanbul Turkish, is the most widely spoken of the Turkic languages, with around 10–15 million native speakers in Southeast Europe (mostly in East and Western Thrace) and 60–65 million native speakers in Western Asia (mostly in Anatolia). Outside Turkey, significant smaller groups of speakers exist in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, the Caucasus, and other parts of Europe and Central Asia. Cyprus has requested that the European Union add Turkish as an official EU language, even though Turkey is not a member state.\n\nTo the west, the influence of Ottoman Turkish—the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of the Ottoman Empire—spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded. In 1928, as one of Atatürk's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey, the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was replaced with a Latin alphabet.\n\nThe distinctive characteristics of the Turkish language are vowel harmony and extensive agglutination. The basic word order of Turkish is subject–object–verb. Turkish has no noun classes or grammatical gender. The language has a strong T–V distinction and usage of honorifics. Turkish uses second-person pronouns that distinguish varying levels of politeness, social distance, age, courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee. The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect.\n\nAbout 40% of all speakers of Turkic languages are native Turkish speakers.The characteristic features of Turkish, such as vowel harmony, agglutination, and lack of grammatical gender, are universal within the Turkic family. The Turkic family comprises some 30 living languages spoken across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Siberia.\n\nTurkish is a member of the Oghuz group of languages, a subgroup of the Turkic language family. There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between Turkish and the other Oghuz Turkic languages, including Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Qashqai, Gagauz, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish.\n\nThe Turkic languages were grouped into the now discredited Altaic language group.\n\nThe earliest known Old Turkic inscriptions are the three monumental Orkhon inscriptions found in modern Mongolia. Erected in honour of the prince Kul Tigin and his brother Emperor Bilge Khagan, these date back to the second Turk Kaghanate. After the discovery and excavation of these monuments and associated stone slabs by Russian archaeologists in the wider area surrounding the Orkhon Valley between 1889 and 1893, it became established that the language on the inscriptions was the Old Turkic language written using the Old Turkic alphabet, which has also been referred to as \"Turkic runes\" or \"runiform\" due to a superficial similarity to the Germanic runic alphabets.\n\nWith the Turkic expansion during Early Middle Ages (c. 6th–11th centuries), peoples speaking Turkic languages spread across Central Asia, covering a vast geographical region stretching from Siberia and to Europe and the Mediterranean. The Seljuqs of the Oghuz Turks, in particular, brought their language, Oghuz—the direct ancestor of today's Turkish language—into Anatolia during the 11th century. Also during the 11th century, an early linguist of the Turkic languages, Mahmud al-Kashgari from the Kara-Khanid Khanate, published the first comprehensive Turkic language dictionary and map of the geographical distribution of Turkic speakers in the \"Compendium of the Turkic Dialects\" (Ottoman Turkish: \"Divânü Lügati't-Türk\").\n\nFollowing the adoption of Islam c. 950 by the Kara-Khanid Khanate and the Seljuq Turks, who are both regarded as the ethnic and cultural ancestors of the Ottomans, the administrative language of these states acquired a large collection of loanwords from Arabic and Persian. Turkish literature during the Ottoman period, particularly Divan poetry, was heavily influenced by Persian, including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of imported words. The literary and official language during the Ottoman Empire period (c. 1299–1922) is termed Ottoman Turkish, which was a mixture of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic that differed considerably and was largely unintelligible to the period's everyday Turkish. The everyday Turkish, known as \"kaba Türkçe\" or \"rough Turkish\", spoken by the less-educated lower and also rural members of society, contained a higher percentage of native vocabulary and served as basis for the modern Turkish language.\n\nAfter the foundation of the modern state of Turkey and the script reform, the Turkish Language Association (TDK) was established in 1932 under the patronage of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, with the aim of conducting research on Turkish. One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a language reform to replace loanwords of Arabic and Persian origin with Turkish equivalents. By banning the usage of imported words in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language. While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from Turkic roots, it also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used for centuries. \n\nOwing to this sudden change in the language, older and younger people in Turkey started to differ in their vocabularies. While the generations born before the 1940s tend to use the older terms of Arabic or Persian origin, the younger generations favor new expressions. It is considered particularly ironic that Atatürk himself, in his lengthy speech to the new Parliament in 1927, used a style of Ottoman which sounded so alien to later listeners that it had to be \"translated\" three times into modern Turkish: first in 1963, again in 1986, and most recently in 1995.\n\nThe past few decades have seen the continuing work of the TDK to coin new Turkish words to express new concepts and technologies as they enter the language, mostly from English. Many of these new words, particularly information technology terms, have received widespread acceptance. However, the TDK is occasionally criticized for coining words which sound contrived and artificial. Some earlier changes—such as ' to replace ', \"political party\"—also failed to meet with popular approval (' has been replaced by the French loanword '). Some words restored from Old Turkic have taken on specialized meanings; for example \"\" (originally meaning \"book\") is now used to mean \"script\" in computer science.\n\nMany of the words derived by TDK coexist with their older counterparts. This usually happens when a loanword changes its original meaning. For instance, ', derived from the Persian ' ( \"pain\"), means \"problem\" or \"trouble\" in Turkish; whereas the native Turkish word \"\" is used for physical pain. Sometimes the loanword has a slightly different meaning from the native Turkish word, creating a situation similar to the coexistence of Germanic and Romance words in English. Some examples of modern Turkish words and the old loanwords are:\n\nTurkish is natively spoken by the Turkish people in Turkey and by the Turkish diaspora in some 30 other countries. Turkish language is mutually intelligible with Azerbaijani and other Turkic languages. In particular, Turkish-speaking minorities exist in countries that formerly (in whole or part) belonged to the Ottoman Empire, such as Iraq, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece (primarily in Western Thrace), the Republic of Macedonia, Romania, and Serbia. More than two million Turkish speakers live in Germany; and there are significant Turkish-speaking communities in the United States, France, The Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Due to the cultural assimilation of Turkish immigrants in host countries, not all ethnic Turkish immigrants speak the language with native fluency.\n\nIn 2005, 93% of the population of Turkey were native speakers of Turkish, about 67 million at the time, with Kurdish languages making up most of the remainder. However, most linguistic minorities in Turkey are bilingual, speaking Turkish with native-like fluency.\n\nTurkish is the official language of Turkey and is one of the official languages of Cyprus. Turkish has official status in 38 municipalities in Kosovo, including Mamusha, and two in the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nIn Turkey, the regulatory body for Turkish is the Turkish Language Association (\"Türk Dil Kurumu\" or TDK), which was founded in 1932 under the name \"Türk Dili Tetkik Cemiyeti\" (\"Society for Research on the Turkish Language\"). The Turkish Language Association was influenced by the ideology of linguistic purism: indeed one of its primary tasks was the replacement of loanwords and foreign grammatical constructions with equivalents of Turkish origin. These changes, together with the adoption of the new Turkish alphabet in 1928, shaped the modern Turkish language spoken today. TDK became an independent body in 1951, with the lifting of the requirement that it should be presided over by the Minister of Education. This status continued until August 1983, when it was again made into a governmental body in the constitution of 1982, following the military coup d'état of 1980.\n\nModern standard Turkish is based on the dialect of Istanbul. This \"Istanbul Turkish\" (\"İstanbul Türkçesi\") constitutes the model of written and spoken Turkish, as recommended by Ziya Gökalp, Ömer Seyfettin and others. \n\nDialectal variation persists, in spite of the levelling influence of the standard used in mass media and the Turkish education system since the 1930s. Academically, researchers from Turkey often refer to Turkish dialects as \"ağız\" or \"şive\", leading to an ambiguity with the linguistic concept of accent, which is also covered with these words. Projects investigating Turkish dialects are being carried out by several universities, as well as a dedicated work group of the Turkish Language Association. Work is currently in progress for the compilation and publication of their research as a comprehensive dialect atlas of the Turkish language.\n\n\"Rumelice\" is spoken by immigrants from Rumelia, and includes the distinct dialects of Ludogorie, Dinler, and Adakale, which are influenced by the theoretized Balkan sprachbund. \"Kıbrıs Türkçesi\" is the name for Cypriot Turkish and is spoken by the Turkish Cypriots. \"Edirne\" is the dialect of Edirne. \"Ege\" is spoken in the Aegean region, with its usage extending to Antalya. The nomadic Yörüks of the Mediterranean Region of Turkey also have their own dialect of Turkish. This group is not to be confused with the Yuruk nomads of Macedonia, Greece, and European Turkey who speak Balkan Gagauz Turkish.\n\n\"Güneydoğu\" is spoken in the southeast, to the east of Mersin. \"Doğu\", a dialect in the Eastern Anatolia Region, has a dialect continuum. The Meskhetian Turks who live in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia as well as in several Central Asian countries, also speak an Eastern Anatolian dialect of Turkish, originating in the areas of Kars, Ardahan, and Artvin and sharing similarities with Azerbaijani, the language of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe Central Anatolia Region speaks \"Orta Anadolu\". \"Karadeniz\", spoken in the Eastern Black Sea Region and represented primarily by the Trabzon dialect, exhibits substratum influence from Greek in phonology and syntax; it is also known as \"Laz dialect\" (not to be confused with the Laz language). \"Kastamonu\" is spoken in Kastamonu and its surrounding areas. Karamanli Turkish is spoken in Greece, where it is called . It is the literary standard for the Karamanlides.\n\nAt least one source claims Turkish consonants are larengially specified three-way fortis-lenis (aspirated/neutral/voiced) like Armenian.\n\nThe phoneme that is usually referred to as \"yumuşak g\" (\"soft g\"), written in Turkish orthography, represents a vowel sequence or a rather weak bilabial approximant between rounded vowels, a weak palatal approximant between unrounded front vowels, and a vowel sequence elsewhere. It never occurs at the beginning of a word or a syllable, but always follows a vowel. When word-final or preceding another consonant, it lengthens the preceding vowel.\n\nIn native Turkic words, the sounds , , and are in complementary distribution with , , and ; the former set occurs adjacent to front vowels and the latter adjacent to back vowels. The distribution of these phonemes is often unpredictable, however, in foreign borrowings and proper nouns. In such words, , , and often occur with back vowels: some examples are given below.\n\nTurkish orthography reflects final-obstruent devoicing, a form of consonant mutation whereby a voiced obstruent, such as , is devoiced to at the end of a word or before a consonant, but retains its voicing before a vowel. In loan words, the voiced equivalent of \"/k/\" is \"/g/\"; in native words, it is \"/ğ/\".\n\nThis is analogous to languages such as German and Russian, but in the case of Turkish, the spelling is usually made to match the sound. However, in a few cases, such as \"ad\" 'name' (dative \"ada\"), the underlying form is retained in the spelling (cf. \"at\" 'horse', dative \"ata\"). Other exceptions are \"od\" 'fire' vs. \"ot\" 'herb', \"sac\" 'sheet metal', \"saç\" 'hair'. Most loanwords, such as \"kitap\" above, are spelled as pronounced, but a few such as \"hac\" 'hajj', \"şad\" 'happy', and \"yad\" 'strange(r)' also show their underlying forms.\n\nNative nouns of two or more syllables that end in \"/k/\" in dictionary form are nearly all \"//ğ//\" in underlying form. However, most verbs and monosyllabic nouns are underlyingly \"//k//\".\n\nThe vowels of the Turkish language are, in their alphabetical order, , , , , , , , . The Turkish vowel system can be considered as being three-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by how and where they are articulated focusing on three key features: front and back, rounded and unrounded and vowel height. Vowels are classified [±back], [±round] and [±high].\n\nThe only diphthongs in the language are found in loanwords and may be categorised as falling diphthongs usually analyzed as a sequence of /j/ and a vowel.\n\nTurkish is an agglutinative language where a series of suffixes are added to the stem word; vowel harmony is a phonological process which ensures a smooth flow, requiring the least amount of oral movement as possible. Vowel harmony can be viewed as a process of assimilation, whereby following vowels take on the characteristics of the preceding vowel. It may be useful to think of Turkish vowels as two symmetrical sets: the a-undotted (a, ı, o, u) which are all back vowels, articulated at the back of the mouth; and the e-dotted (e, i, ö, ü) vowels which are articulated at the front of the mouth. The place and manner of articulation of the vowels will determine which pattern of vowel harmony a word will adopt. The pattern of vowels is shown in the table above.\n\nGrammatical affixes have \"a chameleon-like quality\", and obey one of the following patterns of vowel harmony:\n\nPractically, the twofold pattern (also referred to as the e-type vowel harmony) means that in the environment where the vowel in the word stem is formed in the front of the mouth, the suffix will take the e-form, while if it is formed in the back it will take the a-form. The fourfold pattern (also called the i-type) accounts for rounding as well as for front/back. The following examples, based on the copula \"-dir\" (\"[it] is\"), illustrate the principles of i-type vowel harmony in practice: \"Türkiye'dir (\"it is Turkey\"), \"kapıdır (\"it is the door\"), but \"gündür (\"it is the day\"), \"paltodur (\"it is the coat\").\n\nThere are several exceptions to the vowel harmony rules, which can be categorised as follows:\nSome rural dialects lack some or all of these exceptions mentioned above.\n\nThe road sign in the photograph above illustrates several of these features:\n\nThe rules of vowel harmony may vary by regional dialect. The dialect of Turkish spoken in the Trabzon region of northeastern Turkey follows the reduced vowel harmony of Old Anatolian Turkish, with the additional complication of two missing vowels (ü and ı), thus there is no palatal harmony. It's likely that \"elün\" meant \"your hand\" in Old Anatolian. While the 2nd person singular possessive would vary between back and front vowel, -ün or -un, as in \"elün\" for \"your hand\" and \"kitabun\" for \"your book\", the lack of ü vowel in the Trabzon dialect means -un would be used in both of these cases — \"elun\" and \"kitabun\".\n\nWord-accent is usually on the last syllable in most words. There are however, several exceptions. Exceptions include certain loanwords, particularly from Italian and Greek, as well as interjections, certain question words, adverbs (although not adjectives functioning as adverbs), and many proper names. Loanwords are usually accented on the penultimate syllable ( \"lokanta\" \"restaurant\" or \"iskele\" \"quay\"). Proper names are usually accented on the penultimate syllable as in \"İstanbul\", but sometimes on the antepenultimate, if the word ends in a cretic rhythm (– u x), as in \"Ankara\". (See Turkish phonology#Place names.)\n\nIn addition, there are certain suffixes such as \"-le\" \"with\" and the verbal negative particle \"-me-/-ma-\", which place an accent on the syllable which precedes them, e.g. \"kitáp-la\" \"with the book\", \"dé-me-mek\" \"not to say\".\n\nIn some circumstances (for example, in the second half of compound words or when verbs are preceded by an indefinite object) the accent on a word is suppressed and cannot be heard.\n\nTurkish has two groups of sentences: verbal and nominal sentences. In the case of a verbal sentence, the predicate is a finite verb, while the predicate in nominal sentence will have either no overt verb or a verb in the form of the copula \"ol\" or \"y\" (variants of \"be\"). Examples of both are given below:\n\nThe two groups of sentences have different ways of forming negation. A nominal sentence can be negated with the addition of the word \"değil,\" for example the sentence above would become \"Necla oğretmen değil\" (Necla is not a teacher). However, the verbal sentence requires the addition of a negative suffix -me to the verb (the suffix comes after the stem but before the tense): \"Necla okula gitmedi\" (Necla did not go to school).\n\nIn the case of a verbal sentence, an interrogative morpheme -mi is added to the end of the sentence and stands alone, for example \"Necla okula gitti mi?\" (Did Necla go to school?). In the case of a nominal sentence, then the -mi comes after the predicate but before the personal ending, so for example \"Necla, siz oğretmen misiniz\"? (Necla, are you a teacher? using the formal 2nd person plural).\n\nWord order in simple Turkish sentences is generally subject–object–verb, as in Korean and Latin, but unlike English, for verbal sentences and subject-predicate for nominal sentences. However, as Turkish possesses a case-marking system, and most grammatical relations are shown using morphological markers, often the SOV structure has diminished relevance, in fact it may be considered a \"pragmatic word order\" of language, one that does not rely on word order for grammatical purposes. While the basic word order in Turkish is firmly SOV, the word order may vary in particular conditions.\n\nConsider the following simple sentence which demonstrates that the focus in Turkish is on the element that immediately precedes the verb:\n\nThe postpredicate position signifies what is referred to as background information in Turkish- information that is assumed to be known to both the speaker and the listener, or information that is included in the context. Consider the following examples:\n\nThere has been some debate among linguists whether Turkish is a subject-prominent (like English) or topic-prominent (like Japanese and Korean) language, with recent scholarship implying that it is indeed both subject and topic-prominent. This has direct implications for word order as it is possible for the subject to be included in the verb-phrase in Turkish. There can be S/O inversion in sentences where the topic is of greater importance than the subject.\n\nTurkish is an agglutinative language and frequently uses affixes, and specifically suffixes, or endings. One word can have many affixes and these can also be used to create new words, such as creating a verb from a noun, or a noun from a verbal root (see the section on Word formation). Most affixes indicate the grammatical function of the word.\nThe only native prefixes are alliterative intensifying syllables used with adjectives or adverbs: for example sımsıcak\" (\"boiling hot\" < \"sıcak\") and masmavi\" (\"bright blue\" < \"mavi\").\n\nThe extensive use of affixes can give rise to long words, e.g. \"Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınızcasına\", meaning \"In the manner of you being one of those that we apparently couldn't manage to convert to Czechoslovakian\". While this case is contrived, long words frequently occur in normal Turkish, as in this heading of a newspaper obituary column: \"Bayramlaşamadıklarımız\" (Bayram [festival]-Recipr-Impot-Partic-Plur-PossPl1; \"Those of our number with whom we cannot exchange the season's greetings\"). Another example can be seen in the final word of this heading of the online Turkish Spelling Guide (\"İmlâ Kılavuzu\"): \"Dilde birlik, ulusal birliğin vazgeçilemezlerindendir\" (\"Unity in language is among the indispensables [dispense-Pass-Impot-Plur-PossS3-Abl-Copula] of national unity ~ Linguistic unity is a \"sine qua non\" of national unity\").\n\nThere is no definite article in Turkish, but definiteness of the object is implied when the accusative ending is used (see below). Turkish nouns decline by taking case endings. There are six noun cases in Turkish, with all the endings following vowel harmony (shown in the table using the shorthand superscript notation. The plural marker \"-ler\" ² immediately follows the noun before any case or other affixes (e.g. \"köylerin\" \"of the villages\").\n\nThe accusative case marker is used only for definite objects; compare \"(bir) ağaç gördük\" \"we saw a tree\" with \"ağacı gördük\" \"we saw the tree\". The plural marker \"-ler\" ² is generally not used when a class or category is meant: \"ağaç gördük\" can equally well mean \"we saw trees [as we walked through the forest]\"—as opposed to \"ağaçları gördük\" \"we saw the trees [in question]\".\n\nThe declension of \"ağaç\" illustrates two important features of Turkish phonology: consonant assimilation in suffixes (\"ağaçtan, ağaçta\") and voicing of final consonants before vowels (\"ağacın, ağaca, ağacı\").\n\nAdditionally, nouns can take suffixes that assign person: for example \"-imiz\" , \"our\". With the addition of the copula (for example \"-im\" , \"I am\") complete sentences can be formed. The interrogative particle \"mi\" immediately follows the word being questioned: \"köye mi?\" \"[going] to the village?\", \"ağaç mı?\" \"[is it a] tree?\".\n\nThe Turkish personal pronouns in the nominative case are \"ben\" (1s), \"sen\" (2s), \"o\" (3s), \"biz\" (1pl), \"siz\" (2pl, or 2h), and \"onlar\" (3pl). They are declined regularly with some exceptions: \"benim\" (1s gen.); \"bizim\" (1pl gen.); \"bana\" (1s dat.); \"sana\" (2s dat.); and the oblique forms of \"o\" use the root \"on\". All other pronouns (reflexive \"kendi\" and so on) are declined regularly.\n\nTwo nouns, or groups of nouns, may be joined in either of two ways:\n\n\nThe following table illustrates these principles. In some cases the constituents of the compounds are themselves compounds; for clarity these subsidiary compounds are marked with [square brackets]. The suffixes involved in the linking are underlined. Note that if the second noun group already had a possessive suffix (because it is a compound by itself), no further suffix is added.\n\nAs the last example shows, the qualifying expression may be a substantival sentence rather than a noun or noun group.\n\nThere is a third way of linking the nouns where both nouns take no suffixes (\"takısız tamlama\"). However, in this case the first noun acts as an adjective, e.g. \"Demir kapı\" (iron gate), \"elma yanak\" (\"apple cheek\", i.e. red cheek), \"kömür göz\" (\"coal eye\", i.e. black eye) :\n\nTurkish adjectives are not declined. However most adjectives can also be used as nouns, in which case they are declined: e.g. \"güzel\" (\"beautiful\") → \"güzeller\" (\"(the) beautiful ones / people\"). Used attributively, adjectives precede the nouns they modify. The adjectives \"var\" (\"existent\") and \"yok\" (\"non-existent\") are used in many cases where English would use \"there is\" or \"have\", \"e.g.\" \"süt yok\" (\"there is no milk\", \"lit.\" \"(the) milk (is) non-existent\"); the construction \"\"noun 1\"-GEN \"noun 2\"-POSS var/yok\" can be translated \"\"noun 1\" has/doesn't have \"noun 2\"\"; \"imparatorun elbisesi yok\" \"the emperor has no clothes\" (\"(the) emperor-\"of\" clothes-\"his\" non-existent\"); \"kedimin ayakkabıları yoktu\" (\"my cat had no shoes\", \"lit.\" \"cat-\"my\"-\"of\" shoe-\"plur.\"-\"its\" non-existent-\"past tense\"\").\n\nTurkish verbs indicate person. They can be made negative, potential (\"can\"), or impotential (\"cannot\"). Furthermore, Turkish verbs show tense (present, past, future, and aorist), mood (conditional, imperative, inferential, necessitative, and optative), and aspect. Negation is expressed by the infix \"-me²-\" immediately following the stem.\n\nAlmost all Turkish verbs are conjugated in the same way, most notable exception being the irregular and defective verb \"i-\", the Turkish copula (corresponding to English \"to be\"), which can be used in compound forms (the shortened form is called an enclitic): \"Gelememişti\" = \"Gelememiş idi\" = \"Gelememiş + i- + -di\".\n\n(\"Note\". For the sake of simplicity the term \"tense\" is used here throughout, although for some forms \"aspect\" or \"mood\" might be more appropriate.) There are 9 simple and 20 compound tenses in Turkish. 9 simple tenses are simple past (\"di'li geçmiş\"), inferential past (\"miş'li geçmiş\"), present continuous, simple present (aorist), future, optative, subjunctive, necessitative (\"must\") and imperative. There are three groups of compound forms. Story (\"hikaye\") is the witnessed past of the above forms (except command), rumor (\"rivayet\") is the unwitnessed past of the above forms (except simple past and command), conditional (\"koşul\") is the conditional form of the first five basic tenses. In the example below the second person singular of the verb \"gitmek\" (\"go\"), stem \"gid-/git-\", is shown.\nThere are also so-called combined verbs, which are created by suffixing certain verb stems (like \"bil\" or \"ver\") to the original stem of a verb. \"Bil\" is the suffix for the sufficiency mood. It is the equivalent of the English auxiliary verbs \"able to\", \"can\" or \"may\". \"Ver\" is the suffix for the swiftness mood, \"kal\" for the perpetuity mood and \"yaz\" for the approach (\"almost\") mood. Thus, while \"gittin\" means \"you went\", \"gidebildin\" means \"you could go\" and \"gidiverdin\" means \"you went swiftly\". The tenses of the combined verbs are formed the same way as for simple verbs.\n\nTurkish verbs have attributive forms, including present, similar to the English present participle (with the ending ); future (); indirect/inferential past (); and aorist ( or ). These forms can function as either adjectives or nouns: \"oynamayan çocuklar\" \"children who do not play\", \"oynamayanlar\" \"those who do not play\"; \"okur yazar\" \"reader-writer = literate\", \"okur yazarlar\" \"literates\".\n\nThe most important function of some of these attributive verbs is to form modifying phrases equivalent to the relative clauses found in most European languages. The subject of the verb in an form is (possibly implicitly) in the third person (he/she/it/they); this form, when used in a modifying phrase, does not change according to number. The other attributive forms used in these constructions are the future () and an older form (), which covers both present and past meanings. These two forms take \"personal endings\", which have the same form as the possessive suffixes but indicate the person and possibly number of the subject of the attributive verb; for example, \"yediğim means \"what I eat\", \"yediğin means \"what you eat\", and so on. The use of these \"personal or relative participles\" is illustrated in the following table, in which the examples are presented according to the grammatical case which would be seen in the equivalent English relative clause.\n\nLatest 2010 edition of \"Büyük Türkçe Sözlük\" (\"Great Turkish Dictionary\"), the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by Turkish Language Association, contains 616,767 words, expressions, terms and nouns.\n\nThe 2005 edition of \"Güncel Türkçe Sözlük\", the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by Turkish Language Association, contains 104,481 words, of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin. Among the most significant foreign contributors to Turkish vocabulary are Arabic, French, Persian, Italian, English, and Greek.\n\nTurkish extensively uses agglutination to form new words from nouns and verbal stems. The majority of Turkish words originate from the application of derivative suffixes to a relatively small set of core vocabulary.\n\nTurkish obeys certain principles when it comes to suffixation. Most suffixes in Turkish will have more than one form, depending on the vowels and consonants in the root- vowel harmony rules will apply; consonant-initial suffixes will follow the voiced/ voiceless character of the consonant in the final unit of the root; and in the case of vowel-initial suffixes an additional consonant may be inserted if the root ends in a vowel, or the suffix may lose its initial vowel. There is also a prescribed order of affixation of suffixes- as a rule of thumb, derivative suffixes precede inflectional suffixes which are followed by clitics, as can be seen in the example set of words derived from a substantive root below:\nAnother example, starting from a verbal root:\n\nNew words are also frequently formed by compounding two existing words into a new one, as in German. Compounds can be of two types- bare and (s)I. The bare compounds, both nouns and adjectives are effectively two words juxtaposed without the addition of suffixes for example the word for girlfriend \"kizarkadaş\" (\"kiz+arkadaş\") or black pepper \"karabiber\" (\"kara+biber\"). A few examples of compound words are given below:\nHowever, the majority of compound words in Turkish are (s)I compounds, which means that the second word will be marked by the 3rd person possessive suffix. A few such examples are given in the table below (note vowel harmony):\n\nTurkish is written using a Latin alphabet introduced in 1928 by Atatürk to replace the Ottoman Turkish alphabet, a version of Perso-Arabic alphabet. The Ottoman alphabet marked only three different vowels—long \"ā, ū\" and \"ī\"—and included several redundant consonants, such as variants of \"z\" (which were distinguished in Arabic but not in Turkish). The omission of short vowels in the Arabic script was claimed to make it particularly unsuitable for Turkish, which has eight vowels.\n\nThe reform of the script was an important step in the cultural reforms of the period. The task of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications for sounds specific to Turkish was entrusted to a Language Commission composed of prominent linguists, academics, and writers. The introduction of the new Turkish alphabet was supported by public education centers opened throughout the country, cooperation with publishing companies, and encouragement by Atatürk himself, who toured the country teaching the new letters to the public. As a result, there was a dramatic increase in literacy from its original Third World levels.\n\nThe Latin alphabet was applied to the Turkish language for educational purposes even before the 20th-century reform. Instances include a 1635 Latin-Albanian dictionary by Frang Bardhi, who also incorporated several sayings in the Turkish language, as an appendix to his work (e.g. \"alma agatsdan irak duschamas\"—\"An apple does not fall far from its tree\").\n\nTurkish now has an alphabet suited to the sounds of the language: the spelling is largely phonemic, with one letter corresponding to each phoneme. Most of the letters are used approximately as in English, the main exceptions being , which denotes ( being used for the found in Persian and European loans); and the undotted , representing .

Turkish authorities estimate that there are still around 10,000 people using the whistled language.

{"id": "49102508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49102508", "title": "Voice writing", "text": "Voice writing\n\nVoice writing is a method used for court reporting, medical transcription, and closed captioning. Using the voice writing method, a court reporter speaks directly into a stenomask or speech silencer—a hand-held mask containing one or two microphones and voice-dampening materials. As the reporter repeats the testimony into the recorder, the mask prevents the reporter from being heard during testimony. Voice writers record everything that is said by judges, witnesses, attorneys, and other parties to a proceeding, including gestures and emotional reactions, and either provide real-time feed or prepare transcripts afterwards.\n\nIn medical transcription, some transcriptionists use voice writing, versus typing, when working out of their own home. They receive audio files and use a voice recognition program to translate voice to text. No mask is needed, but a good headset with appropriate microphone is necessary. Sometimes an updated sound card needs to be added in order to have excellent clarity for the voice recognition software. This can be done easily with a small sound card which is attached to the microphone cord and then inserts into a USB port. A foot pedal is also used.\n\nA voice writing system consists of a stenomask, an external sound digitizer, a laptop, speech recognition software. A foot pedal can plug into a computer's USB port.\n\nA real-time voice writer's words go through the mask's cable to an external USB digital signal processor, From there the words go into the computer's speech recognition engine, for conversion into streaming text. The reporter can send the streamed text to a) the Internet; b) a computer file; c) a television station for subtitling; d) to an end-user who is reading the captions via their laptop, tablet, smart phone, or e) software which formats the results in a way most familiar to judges, attorneys, or subtitling consumers.\n\nVoice writers enjoy very high accuracy rates, based upon pure physiology. The route taken by a person's words goes from the mouth to the reporter's ear, brain, and \"inner\" voice. This form of repetition is naturally effortless; it is what we all do in our daily conversation, as we listen to a person speak, or when we read a book. So the most natural extension of this process is to psychologically switch the repetition mechanism from \"inner voice\" to the physiological \"spoken voice.\" Therefore, we minimize the introduction of cognitive overhead in our task of routing the spoken word to its permanent destination as printed words. This streamlined process allows voice writers to achieve excellent performance for many continuous hours and greater than 98 percent accuracy at speeds as high as 350 words per minute.\n\nVoice writers produce the same products as their stenotype colleagues, including transcripts in all electronic and printed formats. Realtime verbatim reporters connect their laptops to captioning equipment, real-time viewer programs, and provide attorneys or other clients with\ncomputer files at the end of the sessions. Only the physical way of capturing speakers' words differentiates voice writing from other methods of court reporting. Every other aspect of this profession is the same, with the exception of the time required to learn the skill, which is much shorter with voice writing.\n\nThe method of court reporting known as voice writing, formerly called \"stenomask,\" was developed by Horace Webb in the World War II era. Prior to inventing voice writing, Webb was a Gregg shorthand writer. Gregg shorthand is a multi-level process in which the reporter records the proceedings using shorthand, then dictates from his notes into a tape recorder. The dictation process alone requires two hours for every one hour of testimony. After the testimony is transferred to audio tape, a transcriptionist types out an official documentation of the proceedings. Mr. Webb wanted to create a reporting method that allowed court reporters to dictate directly during proceedings, eliminating the shorthand process altogether.\n\nHorace Webb and two colleagues spent several years designing the stenomask and perfecting the voicewriting method. The court reporter speaks directly into the stenomask – a handheld mask with a voice silencer. The silencer prevents the court reporter from disturbing proceedings while repeating everything that occurs during testimony -– even unspoken answers, gestures and reactions. Unfortunately, the voicewriting method did not catch on until the method was tested by the U.S. Navy and adopted by the military justice school in Newport, Rhode Island. From then on, the stenomask method of court reporting gained widespread acceptance.\n\nVoice writers have long been available to make the record through the use of a stenomask with a voice silencer and analog tapes. Voice writers not only repeat every word stated by the attorneys, witnesses, judges and other parties to a proceeding but also verbally identify the speaker. They even punctuate the text, describe activities as they take place, and, in some cases, mark exhibits.\n\nNow, however, new technologies are available to them. Digital recording offers a clearer, better-defined soundtrack, making transcription easier and even more accurate.\n\nNew technology, in the form of speech recognition CAT systems, affords the voice writer the opportunity to have the spoken words instantly turned into text on a laptop computer or computer workstation. As a result, the voice writer is now able to produce real-time text feeds within the courtroom and download them in ASCII format for distribution immediately following a proceeding. The equipment used by real-time voice writers can also interface with all litigation-support software.\n\nAll court reporters require the same basic academic background, regardless of method. This includes legal and medical language, business law, and English. The skills track is where the methods diverge. A voice writing student can become real-time certifiable well within the 24-month associate degree window. Paralegals and legal secretaries, because they’ve already taken nearly the same set of core academics required by court reporting, can become proficient in three to six months. In under 12 months, a paralegal or legal secretary can become real-time certified.\n"}

As a child he lived and studied in Peremyshl . He enjoyed a large collection of books collected by his father. Halan was greatly influenced by the creativity of the Ukrainian socialist writer Ivan Franko. In the school by the critical thoughts Yaroslav had conflicts with the priests who taught theology.\n\nAfter the beginning of the World War I his father along with other \"unreliable\" elements who could sympathize the Russians was interned in the Thalerhof camp by the Austrian authorities. Eventually Galitzia was taken by the Russians.\n\nDuring the next Austrian offensive his mother evacuated her family in order to avoid repressions with the retreating Russian army to Rostov-on-Don, where Yaroslav studied at the gymnasium and played in the local theatre. Living there Halan witnessed the Revolutionary events. He became familiar with Lenin’s agitation. Later these events formed the base of his story \"Unforgettable Days\".\n\nWhile in Rostov-on-Don, he discovered the works of some Russian writers such as Leo Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky, Vissarion Belinsky, Anton Chekhov. Halan often went to the theatre. Thus his obsession with this art was born, which in the future determined his decision to become a playwright.\n\nAfter the war he returned to Galitzia (annexed by Poland), where in 1922 he graduated from the Peremyshl Ukrainian Gymnasium. Then he studied in the Triest Higher Trade School in Italy. In 1922 Halan enrolled in the University of Vienna. In 1926 he transferred to the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, which he graduated from in 1928 (according to some sources he didn't pass the final exams). After that Halan started to work as a teacher of the Polish language and literature at a private gymnasium in Lutsk. However, ten months later he got banned from teaching due to political reasons.\n\nIn his students years he joined the left-wing movement. While being a student of the University of Vienna, Halan became a member of the workers' comunity \"Einheit\" (\"Unity\") ruled by the Communist Party of Austria. Since 1924 he proactively participated in the underground national liberation movement, which in the Ukrainian lands of the Second Polish Republic (except of Glitzia being under OUN influence) was headed by the Communist Party of Western Ukraine (CPWU). He joined the CPWU when he was on vacation in Peremyshl. Later, while stuying in Krakow, he was elected a deputy chairman of the legal student organization \"Życie\" (\"Life\") ruled by the Communist Party of Poland.\n\nIn the 1920s, the writer's creative activity also began. In 1927 he finished working on his first significant play \"Don Quixote from Ettenheim\". For the first time he revealed the venality of nationalistic and chauvinistic parties in his play \"99%\" (1930). The theme of class struggle and condemning the segregation were actualized in the plays \"Cargo\" (1930) and \"Cell\" (1932), calling for united actions and class solidarity of Ukrainian, Jewish and Polish proletarians.\n\nHalan's play \"99%\" was staged by the semi-legal \"Lviv Workers’ Theatre\". On the eve of the premiere, Polish authorities launched a campaign of massive arrests against Western Ukrainian communists, sending them to the Lutsk prison. As the theatre's director and one of the key actors were arrested, the premiere was on the verge of failure. Despite risks of being arrested, the workers continued rehearsing, so the play was presented with a delay of only one day. About 600 workers attended the premiere, for them, it was a kind of protest mobilization against repressions and nationalism.\n\nYaroslav Halan was one of the founders of the Ukrainian proletarian writers’ group \"Horno\". From 1927 to 1932 along with other communist writers and members of the CPWU he worked at the Lviv-based Ukrainian magazine \"Vikna,\" being a member of its editorial board, until it was closed by the censorship.\n\nLiving in the Polish-controlled city of Lviv, Halan frequently had to earn money from translating some novels from German into Polish. In 1932 Halan moved to Nyzhniy Bereviz, the native village of his wife located in the Carpathian mountains, close to Kolomyia, and kept working on his own plays, stories and articles there. In the village he spread communist agitation among peasants, created a cell of the International Red Aid and the Committee for Famine Relief. Without opportunities to find any job, he lived in the countryside until June 1935, when he was summoned by the CPWU to return to Lviv.\n\nHalan was denied a Soviet citizenship in 1935.\n\nIn 1935, Yaroslav Halan traveled a lot around Prykarpattia, giving speeches to peasants. He became an experienced propagandist and agitator. Addressing the city workers, Halan explained to them the main points of the Marxist theory. In particular, he had lectures on Friedrich Engels's work \"\" and Karl Marx's \"Wage Labour and Capital\". Together with the young communist writer Olexa Havryliuk, Halan organized safe houses, wrote leaflets and proclamations, transferred illegal literature to Lviv.\n\nThroughout his political career the writer was repeatedly persecuted, twice imprisoned (for the first time in 1934). Yaroslav Halan was one of the organizers of the Lviv Anti-Fascist Congress of Cultural Workers in May 1936. Besides he took part in the biggest political manifestation on April 16, 1936, in Lviv, that was shot by the Polish police (in total, thirty workers were killed and two hundred injured). Halan devoted his story \"Golden Arch\" to the memory of fallen comrades.\n\nParticipation in the Anti-Fascist Congress forced him to escape from Lviv to Warsaw where helived as an unemplyed until December. Eventually, he found a job at the left-wing newspaper \"Dziennik Popularny\" edited by Wanda Wasilewska. In 1937, the newspaper was closed by the authorities, and on April 8 Halan being accused of the illegal communist activism was sent to the prison in Warsaw, later transferred to Lviv. Released in December 1937, Halan lived in Lviv under a strict supervision by the police. Remained unemployed until 1939.\n\nIn 1937, his elder brother, a member of the CPWU, died in Lviv. After the Communist Party of Poland and the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, as its autonomous organization, were dissolved by the Comintern on trumped-up accusations of spying for Poland in 1938, Halan's first wife Anna Henyk (also a member of the CPWU) who was studying at the Kharkiv Medical Institute, USSR, was arrested by the NKVD and executed within the Great Purge.\n\nAfter the USSR annexed Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, in September 1939, Yaroslav Halan worked in the newspaper \"Vilna Ukraina\", directed the Maria Zankovetska Theatre, wrote more than 100 pamphlets and articles on changes taking place in the reunified lands of Western Ukraine.\n\n\"«A group of writers such as Yaroslav Halan, Petro Kozlaniuk, Stepan Tudor and Olexa Havryliuk [...] treated the liberation of Western Ukraine [by the Red Army] as a logical conclusion of the policy of the Communist Party, which fought for the reunification of the Ukrainian people. In this, they actively helped the party in word and deed. In return, they have already had experience with Polish prisons and oppression from their fellow countrymen. Now [after it happened] they could breathe a sigh of relief. That is why their smiles were so sincere and celebratory.»\"\n\nPetro Panch, \"Lviv, Kopernyka str., 42\", Vitchyzna, 1960, issue No 2, 172\n\nIn November 1939 Halan went to Kharkiv trying to find his disappeared wife Anna Henyk. Together with the writer Yuri Smolych he came to the dormitory of the Medical Institute and asked the porter if there is any information about her destiny. The porter only gave him back a suitcase with Anna's belongings and said that she had been arrested by the NKVD, in response to that Halan burst into tears.\n\nIn June 1941, being a journalist of the newspaper \"Vilna Ukraina,\" he got his first professional vacations in Crimea. But he didn't managed to rest, because on June 22 Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union.\n\nWhen the war on the Eastern Front began, Halan arrived in Kharkiv and went to the military commissariat having a big desire to become a volunteer of the Red Army and to go to the frontline but was denied.\n\nHe was evacuated to Ufa. In September 1941, Alexander Fadeyev summoned him to Moscow for working at the Polish-language magazine \"Nowe Horyzonty.\" In the days of the Battle for Moscow, on October 17, he was evacuated to Kazan. \n\nLater the writer arrived in Saratov, where he served as a radio host at the \"Taras Shevchenko Radio Station\". Then he was a special front-line correspondent of the newspaper \"Sovietskaya Ukraina\", and then \"Radianska Ukraina\".\n\n\"«The majority of his radio-comments have been born spontaneously. He listens to the enemy's radio shows, thinks for a while, then goes to the studio with an open microphone and without any preparations responds, expressing everything what he feels. That was a true radio-battle with all Hitler's propagandists starting from Goebbels, Dietrich, and others. The opportunity to fight like this – immediately, without paper [and censorship] – demonstrates a high confidence given to him by the Government and the Central Committee of the CPSU(b).»\"\n\nVolodymyr Beliayev, Literaturna Ukraina, 1962In 1943, in Moscow, he met his future second wife Maria Krotkova, who was an artist. \n\nIn October 1943, the publishing house \"Moscovskiy Bolshevik\" released the collection of 15 Halan's war stories \"Front on Air\". At the end of th year, Halan moved to the recently liberated Kharkov and worked there on the frontline radio station \"Dnipro\".\n\nDuring and after the war he was sharply condemning the Ukrainian nationalists – banderivtsi, melnykivtsi, bulbivtsi – as accomplices of the Nazi occupiers.\n\nIn 1946 Yaroslav Halan as a correspondent of the \"Radianska Ukraina\" newspaper represented the USSR at the Nuremberg trial of Nazi military criminals.\n\nYaroslav Halan wrote much about Ukrainian nationalists. In his story \"What Has No Name\" he described the OUN crimes:\n\n\"«Fourteen-years-old girl can’t calmly look at meat. She trembles if someone is going to cook cutlets in her presence. A few months ago, on Easter Night, armed people came to a peasant house in a village close to the town of Sarny, and stabbed its inhabitants with knives. The girl having the eyes widened of fear was looking at the agony of her parents. The girl with horror in her eyes was looking at the agony of her parents. One of the gangsters put a knife blade to the child’s neck, but at the last moment a new “idea” came to his mind: “Live in glory to Stepan Bandera! And to avoid you being starved to death we will leave you some food. Guys, slice pork for her!\" The \"guys\" liked such a proposal. In a few minutes a mountain of meat made from the bleeding father and mother grew up in front of the horror-struck girl...»\"\n\nIn Halan's tragedy \"Under the Golden Eagle\" (1947) the writer harshly criticizes the American occupation administration in Western Germany for its rude attempts to prevent Soviet soldiers interned in special camps to return to their homeland. In his play \"Love at Dawn\" (1949, published in 1951) he described the triumph of Socialism in the rural areas of Western Ukraine.\n\nOften he was focused on counteracting the nationalistic propaganda. Nevertheless, Halan complained that these \"Augean stables\" were not his vocation but it had to be done by someone:\n\n\"«I understand: the asenisation work is a necessary and useful work, but why only me? Why should I be the only cesspool cleaner? The reader of our periodicals will involuntarily have the thought that there is only \"maniac\" Halan, who has clung to Ukrainian fascism like a drunk clings to the raft, [while] the vast majority of the writers ignore this issue. It isn't needed to be explained what further conclusions the reader will make from this.»\"\n\nFrom Halan's letter to his friend Yuri Smolych, on January 2, 1948.\n\nIn his last satirical pamphlets Yaroslav Halan criticized the nationalistic and clerical reaction (particularly, the Greek Catholic Church and the anti-Communist doctrine of the Holy See): \"Their Face\" (1948), \"In the service of Satan\" (1948), \"In the Face of Facts\" (1949), \"Father of Darkness and His Henchmen\" (1949), \"The Vatican Idols Thirst for Blood\" (1949, in Polish), \"Twilight of the Alien Gods\" (1948), \"What Should Not Be Forgotten\" (1947), \"The Vatican Without Mask\" (1949) etc.\n\nWhen the Vatican had discovered that Halan is going to publish his new anti-clerical pamphlet \"Father of Darkness and His Henchmen\", in July 1949 the Pope Pius XII excommunicated him. In response to this, Halan wrote a pamphlet \"I Spit on the Pope\", that caused a significant resonance within the Church and among believers. In the pamphlet he ironized on the \"Decree against Communism\" released by the Vatican on July 1, in which the Holy See had threatened to excommunicate all members of the Communist parties and active supporters of the Communists:\n\n\"«My only consolation is that I am not alone: together with me, the Pope excommunicated at least three hundred million people, and with them I once again in full voice declare: I spit on the Pope!»\"\n\nYaroslav Halan was killed in an assassination on October 24, 1949, in his home office, which was situated at Hvadiyska street in Lviv. He received 11 hits to the head with an axe. His blood spilled on the manuscript of his new article \"Greatness of the Liberated Human\" dedicated the tenth anniversary of the reunification of Western Ukraine with the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nThe killers – two students of the Lviv Forestry Technical Institute Ilariy Lukashevych and Mykhailo Stakhur – committed the assassination after they got the appropriate order by the OUN leadership. On the eve of the murder Lukashevych gained the writer's confidence, so the students were let into the house. They came to the apartment under the pretext of being discriminated against at the university and seeking his help. When Lukashevych gave a signal, Stakhur attacked the writer with the axe. After Stakhur got convinced that Halan is dead, they tied up the housekeeper and escaped.\n\nThe Ministry of the State Security (MGB) accused the Ukrainian nationalists of his murder, while the OUN claimed that it was a Soviet provocation in order to start a new wave of repressions against locals.\n\nNikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Ukrainian SSR at that time, took personal control of the investigation. In 1951, the MGB agent Bohdan Stashynskyi being infiltrated into the OUN underground network managed to find Stakhur, who himself bragged about the assassination of Halan. He was arrested on July 10, and afterwards fully admitted his responsibility for the crime during the trial. According to Stakhur, he did that because of the writer's critical statements on the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Vatican.\n\nOn October 16, 1951, the military tribunal of the Carpathian Military District sentenced Mikhail Stakhur to death by hanging: the court hall applauded the announcement of the verdict. The verdict was enforced on the same day.\n\nSome contemporary Ukrainian historians and journalists put forward the hypothesis that Halan was killed by the Soviets. However, nowadays the fact of the OUN guilt proved with the numerous pieces of evidence is widely recognized by the vast majority of historians.\n\nThe assassination of Halan caused tightening of measures against the nationalist Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which continued terrorist activities against the Soviet power in Western Ukraine. All the leadership of the MGB arrived in Lviv, Pavel Sudoplatov himself worked there for several months. One of the consequences of the murder of Halan was the elimination of the UPA leader Roman Shukhevych four months later.\n\n\"«Yaroslav Halan is a talented publicist, was a progressive writer in the past. Nowadays he still is the most advanced one among [local] non-party writers. But he's infected with the Western European bourgeois \"spirit\". Has little respect for Soviet people. Considers them not civilized enough. But just inwardly. In general terms, he understands the policy of the party, but in his opinion, the party makes great mistakes with regards to peasants in Western Ukraine. Halan places responsibility for these mistakes on the regional committee of the CPSU(b), local institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the local Soviet authorities. Believes in Moscow. Doesn't want to join the party (he was advised to) due to being an individualist, and also in order to keep his hands, mind, and words free. He thinks if he joins the party, he will lose this [freedom].»\"\n\nExtract from the report of the literary critic G. Parkhomenko to the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine December 15, 1947.\n\nIn 1962, in Toronto, Olexandr Matla, aka Petro Tereschuk, a pro-nationalist historian from the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada, published the brochure \"History of a Traitor (Yaroslav Halan)\", in which he accused Halan of being an informer of both Polish and Soviet intelligence services, and of helping them to oppress nationalists and even some pro-Soviet writers from Western Ukraine such as Anton Krushelnytsky, who moved from Lviv to Kharkiv in the 1930s and was killed during the Great Terror.\n\n\"«[Halan] has used his undeniable publicistic talent to serve the enemy, thereby placing himself outside the Ukrainian people.
