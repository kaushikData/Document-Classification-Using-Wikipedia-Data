The language has Eastern and Western forms, which differ in vocabulary and phonology, and are sometimes considered distinct languages.\n\nEastern Abenaki languages are spoken by several peoples, including the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot of coastal Maine. The last known natively fluent speaker of Penobscot, Madeline Shay, died in 1993. However, several Penobscot elders still speak Penobscot, and there is an ongoing effort to preserve it and teach it in the local schools. Other dialects of Eastern Abenaki, such as \"Caniba\" and \"Aroosagunticook\", are documented in French-language materials from the colonial period.\n\nIn 1991, Western Abenaki was spoken by 20 individuals along the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City, mostly at Odanak, the site of the former mission village of St. Francis, and by about 50 individuals living throughout New York state and Connecticut. By 2006 five speakers were recorded.\n\nIn \"Reflections in Bullough's Pond\", historian Diana Muir argues that Abenaki neighbors, the pre-contact Iroquois, were an imperialist, expansionist culture whose cultivation of the corn/beans/squash agricultural complex enabled them to support a large population. They made war primarily against neighboring Algonquian peoples, including the Abenaki. Muir uses archaeological data to argue that the Iroquois expansion onto Algonquian lands was checked by the Algonquian adoption of agriculture. This enabled them to support their own populations large enough to have sufficient warriors to defend against the threat of Iroquois conquest.\n\nIn 1614, six years before the Mayflower, an English captain, Thomas Hunt, captured 24 young Abenaki people from what would later become Massachusetts and took them to Europe to sell as slaves. As a result, when the Mayflower landed and the English began to establish colonies in the southern end of Abenaki territory, relations between the English and natives remained guarded. Especially, the religious leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony discouraged social interaction with the natives. By contrast, the French had already planted the colonies of New France in the northern part of Abenaki territory, and maintained reasonably cordial relations with the natives. Intermarriage between the French and natives gave rise to the Métis people. Over the next hundred years, European conflicts between the French and the English often included their colonies and their respective native allies. The French treated their Abenaki allies with some respect; in 1709, Louis XIV knighted Chief Assacumbuit for his service, thus elevating him as a member of the French nobility.\nFacing annihilation from English attacks and epidemics of new infectious diseases, the southern Abenaki started to emigrate to Quebec around 1669. The governor of New France allocated two seigneuries (large self-administered areas similar to feudal fiefs). The first was on the Saint Francis River and is now known as the \"Odanak\" Indian Reservation; the second was founded near Bécancour and is called the \"Wolinak\" Indian Reservation.\n\nWhen the Wampanoag under Metacomet, also called \"King Philip\", fought the English colonists in New England in 1675 in King Philip's War, the Abenaki joined the Wampanoag. For three years there was fighting along the Maine frontier in the First Abenaki War. The Abenaki pushed back the line of white settlement by devastating raids on scattered farmhouses and small villages. The war was settled by a peace treaty in 1678.\n\nDuring Queen Anne's War in 1702, the Abenaki were allied with the French; they raided numerous small villages in Maine, from Wells to Casco, killing about 300 settlers over ten years. The raids stopped when the war ended. Some captives were adopted into the Mohawk and Abenaki tribes; older captives were generally ransomed, and the colonies carried on a brisk trade.\n\nThe Third Abenaki War (1722–25), called Dummer's War, erupted when the French Jesuit missionary Sébastien Rale (or Rasles, 1657?-1724) encouraged the Abenaki to halt the spread of Yankee settlements. When the Massachusetts militia tried to seize Rasles, the Abenaki raided the settlements at Brunswick, Arrowsick, and Merry-Meeting Bay. The Massachusetts government then declared war, and bloody battles were fought at Norridgewock (1724), where Rasles was killed, and at a daylong battle at Pequawket, an Indian village near present-day Fryeburg, Maine, on the upper Saco River (1725). Peace conferences at Boston and Casco Bay brought an end to the war. After Rale died, the Abenaki moved to a settlement on the St. Francis River.\n\nThe Abenaki from St. Francois continued to raid British settlements in their former homelands along the New England frontier during Father Le Loutre's War (see Northeast Coast Campaign (1750)) and the French and Indian War.\n\nAmaseconti, Androscoggin, Kennebec, Maliseet, Ouarastegouiak, Passamaquoddy, [[Patsuiket, [[Penobscot]], [[Pigwacket]], [[Rocameca]], [[Sokoni]], and [[Wewenoc]].\nSeven mission orientated communities along the [[St. Lawrence River in 1750: [[Caughnawaga (Mohawk), Lake of the Two Mountains ([[Iroquois and[[ Nipissing), St. Francois ([[Sokoki]], [[Pennacook]], and New England [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquin]]), [[Becancour]] ([[Eastern Abenaki]]), [[Oswegatchie people|Oswegatchie]] ([[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] and [[Oneida people|Oneida]]), [[Lorette]] (Huron), and St. Regis (Mohawk).\nAmaseconti (between upper [[Kennebec River|Kennebec]] River and [[Androscoggin River]], western Maine) [[Androscoggin people|Androscoggin]] (Amariscoggin, Ameriscoggin, Anasaguniticook, Arosaguntacook, Asschincantecook). Important note - Main village, on the river of the same name was called Arosaguntacook Town. Arosaguntacook is sometimes applied in error to the St. Francois Indians. Kennebec (Caniba, Sagadahoc, Kanibesinnoak, Norridgewock, Nurhantsuak) lived along the Kennebec River in northern Maine. Penobscot (Pentagoet, Panaomeska). Meaning \"rocky place,\" or \"ledge place.\" Penobscot Tribe Subdivisions and Villages included: Moosehead Lake are tribes were known as \"Moosehead Lake Indians.\" Villages: Agguncia, Asnela, Catawamtek, Kenduskeag, Mattawamkeag, Meecombe, Negas, Olamon, Oldtown, Passadumkeag, Pentagouet, Precaute, Segocket, and Wabigganus. Pigwacket (Pegouakki, Peguaki, Pequawket). Main village called Pequawket Town was located on the upper Saco River. Rocameca Upper Androscoggin River.

Located on a lake of the same name in east-central New Hampshire.Other names associated with the eastern Abenaki: Arsikantegou, Kwupahag (Kwapahag).\n\nCloser in language and culture to the Micmac, the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy have been listed as Abenaki for historical reasons. The French usually referred to both tribes as the Etchemin. Maliseet (Aroostook, Malecite, Malicite, St. John's Indians). From the Micmac word \"malisit\" meaning \"broken talker.\" Their own name \"Wulastegniak\" means \"good river people.\" Located along the St. John River in northeastern Maine and western New Brunswick. Devon, Kingsclear, Madawaska, Mary's, Medoctec (Medoktek, Meductic), Okpaak, Oromocto, St. Anne, St. Basile, The Brothers (Micmac), Tobique, Viger, and Woodstock. Passamaquoddy (Machias Tribe, Opanango, Pesmokant, Quoddy, Scotuks, Scootuck, St. Croix Indians, Unchechauge, Unquechauge). The name means \"pollock spearing place\" with their villages were located on Passamaquoddy Bay, the St. Croix River, and Schoodic Lake. Villages: Gunasquamekook, Imnarkuan, Machias, Sebaik, and Sipayik. Other towns at Lewis Island and Calais in Maine with a few locations on the Canadian side of the St. Croix River.\nOriginally composed of Abenaki tribes in Vermont and New Hampshire west of the White Mountains, Sokoki means \"people who separated.\" Various forms of Sokoki are: Assokwekik, Ondeake, Onejagese, Sakukia, Sokokiois, Sokoquios, Sokoquis, Sokokquis, Sokoni, Sokwaki, Soquachjck, and Zooquagese. Some accounts include groups of the western Pennacook as Sokoki: Amoskeag, Naamkeek, Nashaway, Souheyan, and Winnipesaukee. Sokoki is often confused with the Saco, a name given to eastern Abenaki who lived near the Saco River (a combination of Pigwacket, Kennebec, and Androscoggin). Cowasuck (Cahass, Cohassiac, Coos, Coosuc, Koes). Hoosac was a mixed settlement with the Mahican.

For example, since 1960, the Odanak Historical Society has managed the first and one of the largest aboriginal museums in Quebec, a few miles from the [[Quebec City|Quebec]]-[[Montreal]] axis. Over 5,000 people visit the Abenaki Museum annually. Several Abenaki companies include: in Wôlinak, General Fiberglass Engineering employs a dozen natives, with annual sales of more than $3 million Canadian dollars. Odanak is now active in transportation and distribution. Notable Abenaki from this area include the documentary filmmaker [[Alanis Obomsawin]] ([[National Film Board of Canada]]).\n\nThese two tribes are officially listed [[list of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized]] as tribes in the United States. the [[Passamaquoddy]] Tribe of Maine was recognized by the federal courts as a tribe, but not having a land trust with the government since never entering into a formal treaty. This launched the very long legal battle that paved the way for many other tribes across America file file suits regarding assett mismanagement. After winning the landmark case, simuar cases were filed in 2006 by 60 tribes from throughout the United States. Among the Passamaquoddy’s assets was $13.5 million in federal funds that were allocated to the tribe in 1980 through the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act, which was settled for $81.5 million. \n\nIn 2006, the state of [[Vermont]] officially recognized the Abenaki as a People, but not a Tribe. The state noted that many Abenaki had been assimilated, only small remnants remained on reservations during and after the [[French and Indian War]], and later [[eugenics]] projects further decimated the Abenaki people of America through forced [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] and questionable \"[[miscarriage]]s\" at birth. As noted above, facing annihilation, many Abenaki had begun emigrating to Canada, then under French control, around 1669.\n\nThe [[Missiquoi|Sokoki-St. Francis Band]] of the Abenaki Nation organized a tribal council in 1976 at [[Swanton (town), Vermont|Swanton, Vermont]]. Vermont granted recognition of the council the same year, but later withdrew it. In 1982, the band applied for federal recognition, which is still pending. Four Abenaki communities are located in Vermont. On April 22, 2011, Vermont officially recognized two Abenaki bands: the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki and the El Nu Abenaki Tribe. On May 7, 2012, the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi and the Koasek of the Koas Abenaki Traditional Band received recognition by the State of Vermont.\n\nThe Abenaki who chose to remain in the United States did not fare as well as their Canadian counterparts. Tribal connections were lost as those Abenaki who were tolerated by the Anglo population were assimilated into colonial society. What familial groups remained were often eradicated, in the early 20th century, through forced sterilization and [[pregnancy termination]] policies in Vermont. There were over 3,400 reported cases of sterilization of Abenaki having been performed, many of which involved termination of an unborn fetus. No documentation of informed consent for these procedures was found. After this period the only Abenaki that remained in the United States were those who could pass for white, or avoid capture and subsequent dissolution of their families through forced interment in \"schools\" after their sterilization. At the time, many of the children who were sterilized were not even aware of what the physicians had done to them. This was performed under the auspices of the Brandon School of the Feeble-Minded, and the Vermont Reform School. It was documented in the 1911 \"Preliminary Report of the Committee of the Eugenic Section of the American Breeder's Association to Study and to Report on the Best Practical Means for Cutting Off the Defective Germ-Plasm in the Human Population.\"\n\nThe [[Vermont]] Elnu ([[Jamaica, Vermont|Jamaica]]) and Nulhegan ([[Brownington, Vermont|Brownington]]) bands' application for official recognition was recommended and referred to the [[Vermont General Assembly]] by the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs on January 19, 2011, as a result of a process established by the Vermont legislature in 2010. Recognition allows applicants to seek scholarship funds reserved for American Indians and to receive federal \"native made\" designation for the bands' arts and crafts.\n\nOn April 22, 2011, Vermont officially recognized two Abenaki bands: the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki and the El Nu Abenaki Tribe. On May 7, 2012, the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi and the Koasek Traditional Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation received recognition by the State of Vermont.\n\nIn New Hampshire the Abenaki, along with other Native American groups, have proposed legislation for recognition as a minority group. This bill was debated in 2010 in the [[New Hampshire General Court|state legislature]]. The bill would have created a state commission on Native American relations, which would act as an advisory group to the [[governor of New Hampshire|governor]] and the state government in general. The Abenaki want to gain formal state recognition as a people.\n\nOpponents of the bill feared it could lead to Abenaki land claims for property now owned and occupied by European Americans. Others worried that the Abenaki may use recognition as a step toward opening a casino. But, the bill specifically says that \"this act shall not be interpreted to provide any Native American or Abenaki person with any other special rights or privileges that the state does not confer on or grant to other state residents.\" New Hampshire has considered expanding gambling separate from the Native Americans.\n\nThe council would be under the Department of Cultural Resources, so it would be in the same department as the State Council on the Arts. The bill would allow for the creation and sale of goods to be labeled as Native-made, to create a source of income for the Natives in New Hampshire.\n\nThe numerous groups of Natives in the state have created a New Hampshire Inter-tribal Council, which holds statewide meetings and [[powwow]]s. Dedicated to preserving the culture of the Natives in New Hampshire, the group is one of the chief supporters of the HB 1610; the Abenaki, the main tribe in the state, are the only people named specifically in the bill.\n\nA new generation is actively preserving and revitalizing the language. Fluent speakers Joseph Elie Joubert from the Odanak reservation and Jesse Bowman Bruchac lead partial immersion classes in the language across the [[northeastern United States]]. They have created several books in and about the language as well as audio, video and web-based media to help others learn the language. In July 2013, the Penobscot Nation, the [[University of Maine]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]] received a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] to expand and publish the first Penobscot Dictionary.\nThroughout time, Abenaki language has been made to thought it was unimportant and with the fading of generations, the [[Abenaki]] language became more and more scarce. Abenaki language was as low as twelve native speakers as of 2015, but with recent focus and extra efforts in the Abenaki community, this number seems to be growing. Today, there are some passionate Abenaki, and non Abenaki people, like Jeanne Brink` of Vermont, who are trying to revitalize the Abenaki culture, which includes their language and their basket making traditions. Today, there are about 12,000 people of varying Abenaki heritage in the Canadian and New England regions, all varying in their connection to their language. In [[Maine]], there are about 3,000 [[Penobscot]] Native Americans, and this is a large driving force of the language resurrection.\n\nAmong Brink and others, [[Jesse Bruchac]] is a loud voice in the Abenaki culture. Along with writing and publishing various Abenaki books, he created a movie and sound piece telling the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] side of Thanksgiving while spoken in Abenaki. In this film, called [[Saints & Strangers]], the three actors not only memorized the lines in Abenaki, but also learned the syntax behind the language and learnt from filming. This revitalization of the famous Thanksgiving story from a new tongue and perspective offered a more original and full version of what Thanksgiving might have really been like so many years ago.\n\nIn Bruchac's novel, \"L8dwaw8gan Wji Abaznodakaw8gan: The Language of Basket Making \" Bruchac notes that Abenaki is a poly-synthetic language, which makes the ways to express oneself in Abenaki is almost limitless. Abenaki language consists of dependent and independent grammar, which address the gender of the speaker. Abenaki also uses nouns, pronouns, first, second, third, and indefinite parts of speech, and verbs, and adjectives. If the noun is animate or inanimate alters the structure of the sentence or phrase.\n\nAlthough written primarily in English, \"Aln8bak News\" helped to preserve the Abenaki language through the inclusion of Abenaki words and their translations throughout each newsletter. \"Aln8bak News\" was a quarterly newsletter that discussed cultural, historical, and contemporary information regarding the Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki. It was started in 1993, by Paul Pouilot, Sagamo of the Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki. The word, Aln8bak (pronounced like Alnôbak) is often used as a synonym to [[Abenaki]]. Initially the newsletter was called \"Aln8ba8dwa National News\" (Aln8ba8dwa or Alnôbaôdwa means \"Abenaki speaking\"). Issues of the quarterly newsletter from 2003-2010 were published by the Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki on their website. According to a statement made by the Band, after 2010, they stopped publishing the newsletter on their website due a lack of financial support from online readers. \n\"Aln8bak News\" included community-related information such as updates on governance issues, notices of social events, and obituaries. The newsletter also included Band history, genealogy, language lessons, recipes, plant and animal studies, books reviews, and writings by Band members.\n\nThe English word \"[[skunk]]\", attested in [[New England]] in the 1630s, is probably borrowed from the Abenaki \"seganku\". About 500 Penobscot words are \"still being used in the community in everyday language,\" such as \"Muhmum\" for \"grandpa\", and \"nolke\" for \"deer\".\n\nThe 2015 [[National Geographic Channel]] mini-series \"[[Saints & Strangers]]\", telling the story surrounding the foundation of [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth Plantation]] and the celebration of the \"First Thanksgiving\", contained a considerable amount of dialogue in the Western Abenaki language. Several actors, including [[Tatanka Means]] ([[Hobbamock]]), and [[Raoul Trujillo]] ([[Massasoit]]) spoke the language exclusively throughout the series, and Kalani Qweypo ([[Squanto]]) spoke both Abenaki and English. Western Abenaki language teacher [[Jesse Bruchac]] of Ndakinna Education Center was hired as a language consultant on the film.\n\nEastern Abenaki dialects included Penobscot, Norridgewock, Caniba, Androscoggin, and Pequawket.\n\nWestern Abenaki dialects are or were Arsigantegok, Missisquoi, Sokoki, Pennacook, and Odanak.\n\nThe following description is for the two Abenaki dialects.\n\nLinguists studying the Abenaki have called the language a language of verbs due to its high degree of inflectional complexity. Although the language does not use gender, nouns are divided into two categories: noble and ignoble. Although there may be occasional exceptions, noble words pertain to living things, while inanimate objects are considered to be ignoble words.\n\n\"bazegw\" = one<br>\n\"niz\" = two<br>\n\"nas\" = three<br>\n\"yaw\" = four<br>\n\"n[ô]lan\" * = five<br>\n\"ngued[ô]z\" * = six<br>\n\"tôbawôz\" = seven<br>\n\"nsôzek\" = eight<br>\n\"noliwi\" = nine<br>\n\"mdala\" = ten\n\n[[File:Abenaki Tribe.jpg|thumb|An Abenaki in Pan Indian (non traditional) clothing]]\n\"sanôba\" = man<br>\n\"p[e]hanem\" * = woman<br>\n\"miguen\" = feather\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Abenaki culture]]\n[[Category:Eastern Algonquian languages]]\n[[Category:Indigenous languages of the North American eastern woodlands]]\n[[Category:First Nations languages in Canada]]\n[[Category:Extinct languages of North America]]\n[[Category:Native American language revitalization]]\n[[Category:Endangered indigenous languages of the Americas]]"}

{"id": "441611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=441611", "title": "Broadcast television systems", "text": "Broadcast television systems\n\nBroadcast television systems are encoding or formatting standards for the transmission and reception of terrestrial television signals. There were three main analog television systems in use around the world until the late 2010s (expected): NTSC, PAL, and SECAM. Now in digital television (DTV), there are four main systems in use around the world: ATSC, DVB, ISDB and DTMB.\n\nAll but one analog television system began as black-and-white systems. Each country, faced with local political, technical, and economic issues, adopted a color television system which was grafted onto an existing monochrome system, using gaps in the video spectrum (explained below) to allow color transmission information to fit in the existing channels allotted. The grafting of the color transmission standards onto existing monochrome systems permitted existing monochrome television receivers predating the changeover to color television to continue to be operated as monochrome television. Because of this compatibility requirement, color standards added a second signal to the basic monochrome signal, which carries the color information. The color information is called chrominance with the symbol C, while the black and white information is called the luminance with the symbol Y. Monochrome television receivers only display the luminance, while color receivers process both signals. Though in theory any monochrome system could be adopted to a color system, in practice some of the original monochrome systems proved impractical to adapt to color and were abandoned when the switch to color broadcasting was made. All countries used one of three color systems: NTSC, PAL, or SECAM.\n\nIgnoring color, all television systems work in essentially the same manner. The monochrome image seen by a camera (later, the luminance component of a color image) is divided into horizontal \"scan lines\", some number of which make up a single image or \"frame\". A monochrome image is theoretically continuous, and thus unlimited in horizontal resolution, but to make television practical, a limit had to be placed on the bandwidth of the television signal, which puts an ultimate limit on the horizontal resolution possible. When color was introduced, this necessity of limit became fixed. All analog television systems are \"interlaced\": alternate rows of the frame are transmitted in sequence, followed by the remaining rows in their sequence. Each half of the frame is called a \"video field\", and the rate at which field are transmitted is one of the fundamental parameters of a video system. It is related to the utility frequency at which the electricity distribution system operates, to avoid flicker resulting from the beat between the television screen deflection system and nearby mains generated magnetic fields. All digital, or \"fixed pixel,\" displays have progressive scanning and must deinterlace an interlaced source. Use of inexpensive deinterlacing hardware is a typical difference between lower- vs. higher-priced flat panel displays (Plasma display, LCD, etc.).\n\nAll films and other filmed material shot at 24 frames per second must be transferred to video frame rates using a telecine in order to prevent severe motion jitter effects. Typically, for 25 frame/s formats (European among other countries with 50 Hz mains supply), the content is PAL speedup, while a technique known as \"\" is used for 30 frame/s formats (North America among other countries with 60 Hz mains supply) to match the film frame rate to the video frame rate without speeding up the play back.\n\nAnalog television signal standards are designed to be displayed on a cathode ray tube (CRT), and so the physics of these devices necessarily controls the format of the video signal. The image on a CRT is painted by a moving beam of electrons which hits a phosphor coating on the front of the tube. This electron beam is steered by a magnetic field generated by powerful electromagnets close to the source of the electron beam.\n\nIn order to reorient this magnetic steering mechanism, a certain amount of time is required due to the inductance of the magnets; the greater the change, the greater the time it takes for the electron beam to settle in the new spot.\n\nFor this reason, it is necessary to shut off the electron beam (corresponding to a video signal of zero luminance) during the time it takes to reorient the beam from the end of one line to the beginning of the next (\"horizontal retrace\") and from the bottom of the screen to the top (\"vertical retrace\" or \"vertical blanking interval\"). The horizontal retrace is accounted for in the time allotted to each scan line, but the vertical retrace is accounted for as \"phantom lines\" which are never displayed but which are included in the number of lines per frame defined for each video system. Since the electron beam must be turned off in any case, the result is gaps in the television signal, which can be used to transmit other information, such as test signals or color identification signals.\n\nThe temporal gaps translate into a comb-like frequency spectrum for the signal, where the teeth are spaced at line frequency and concentrate most of the energy; the space between the teeth can be used to insert a color subcarrier.\n\nBroadcasters later developed mechanisms to transmit digital information on the phantom lines, used mostly for teletext and closed captioning:\n\nTelevision images are unique in that they must incorporate regions of the picture with reasonable-quality content, that will never be seen by some viewers.\n\nIn a purely analog system, field order is merely a matter of convention. For digitally recorded material it becomes necessary to rearrange the field order when conversion takes place from one standard to another.\n\nAnother parameter of analog television systems, minor by comparison, is the choice of whether vision modulation is positive or negative. Some of the earliest electronic television systems such as the British 405-line (system A) used positive modulation. It was also used in the two Belgian systems (system C, 625 lines, and System F, 819 lines) and the two French systems (system E, 819 lines, and system L, 625 lines). In positive modulation systems, as in the earlier white facsimile transmission standard, the maximum luminance value is represented by the maximum carrier power; in negative modulation, the maximum luminance value is represented by zero carrier power. All newer analog video systems use negative modulation with the exception of the French System L.\n\nImpulsive noise, especially from older automotive ignition systems, caused white spots to appear on the screens of television receivers using positive modulation but they could use simple synchronization circuits. Impulsive noise in negative modulation systems appears as dark spots that are less visible, but picture synchronization was seriously degraded when using simple synchronization. The synchronization problem was overcome with the invention of phase-locked synchronization circuits. When these first appeared in Britain in the early 1950s one name used to describe them was \"flywheel synchronisation.\"\n\nOlder televisions for positive modulation systems were sometimes equipped with a peak video signal inverter that would turn the white interference spots dark. This was usually user-adjustable with a control on the rear of the television labeled \"White Spot Limiter\" in Britain or \"Antiparasite\" in France. If adjusted incorrectly it would turn bright white picture content dark. Most of the positive modulation television systems ceased operation by the mid-1980s. The French System L continued on up to the transition to digital broadcasting. Positive modulation was one of several unique technical features that originally protected the French electronics and broadcasting industry from foreign competition and rendered French TV sets incapable of receiving broadcasts from neighboring countries.\n\nAnother advantage of negative modulation is that, since the synchronizing pulses represent maximum carrier power, it is relatively easy to arrange the receiver automatic gain control to only operate during sync pulses and thus get a constant amplitude video signal to drive the rest of the TV set. This was not possible for many years with positive modulation as the peak carrier power varied depending on picture content. Modern digital processing circuits have achieved a similar effect but using the front porch of the video signal.\n\nGiven all of these parameters, the result is a mostly-continuous analog signal which can be modulated onto a radio-frequency carrier and transmitted through an antenna. All analog television systems use vestigial sideband modulation, a form of amplitude modulation in which one sideband is partially removed. This reduces the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, enabling narrower channels to be used.\n\nIn analog television, the analog audio portion of a broadcast is invariably modulated separately from the video. Most commonly, the audio and video are combined at the transmitter before being presented to the antenna, but separate aural and visual antennas can be used. In all cases where negative video is used, FM is used for the standard monaural audio; systems with positive video use AM sound and intercarrier receiver technology cannot be incorporated. Stereo, or more generally multi-channel, audio is encoded using a number of schemes which (except in the French systems) are independent of the video system. The principal systems are NICAM, which uses a digital audio encoding; double-FM (known under a variety of names, notably Zweikanalton, A2 Stereo, West German Stereo, German Stereo or IGR Stereo), in which case each audio channel is separately modulated in FM and added to the broadcast signal; and BTSC (also known as MTS), which multiplexes additional audio channels into the FM audio carrier. All three systems are compatible with monaural FM audio, but only NICAM may be used with the French AM audio systems.\n\nFor historical reasons, some countries use a different video system on UHF than they do on the VHF bands. In a few countries, most notably the United Kingdom, television broadcasting on VHF has been entirely shut down. Note that the British 405-line system A, unlike all the other systems, suppressed the upper sideband rather than the lower—befitting its status as the oldest operating television system to survive into the color era (although was never officially broadcast with color encoding). System A was tested with all three color systems, and production equipment was designed and ready to be built; System A might have survived, as NTSC-A, had the British government not decided to harmonize with the rest of Europe on a 625-line video standard, implemented in Britain as PAL-I on UHF only.\n\nThe French 819 line system E was a post-war effort to advance France's standing in television technology. Its 819-lines were almost high definition even by today's standards. Like the British system A, it was VHF only and remained black & white until its shutdown in 1984 in France and 1985 in Monaco. It was tested with SECAM in the early stages, but later the decision was made to adopt color in 625-lines. Thus France adopted system L on UHF only and abandoned system E.\n\nIn many parts of the world, analog television broadcasting has been shut down completely, or in process of shutdown; see Digital television transition for a timeline of the analog shutdown.\n\nA number of experimental and broadcast pre WW2 systems were tested. The first ones were mechanically based and of very low resolution, sometimes with no sound. Later TV systems were electronic.\n\nOn an international conference in Stockholm in 1961, the International Telecommunication Union designated standards for broadcast television systems.\nEach standard is designated a letter (A-M); in combination with a color system (NTSC, PAL, SECAM), this completely specifies all of the monaural analog television systems in the world (for example, PAL-B, NTSC-M, etc.).\n\nThe following table gives the principal characteristics of each standard. Defunct TV systems are shown in grey text, previous ones never designated by ITU are not yet shown. Except for lines and frame rates, other units are megahertz (MHz).\n\n\nThe situation with worldwide digital television is much simpler by comparison. Most digital television systems are based on the MPEG transport stream standard, and use the H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 video codec. They differ significantly in the details of how the transport stream is converted into a broadcast signal, in the video format prior to encoding (or alternatively, after decoding), and in the audio format. This has not prevented the creation of an international standard that includes both major systems, even though they are incompatible in almost every respect.\n\nThe two principal digital broadcasting systems are ATSC standards, developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee and adopted as a standard in most of North America, and DVB-T, the Digital Video Broadcast – Terrestrial system used in most of the rest of the world. DVB-T was designed for format compatibility with existing direct broadcast satellite services in Europe (which use the DVB-S standard, and also sees some use in direct-to-home satellite dish providers in North America), and there is also a DVB-C version for cable television. While the ATSC standard also includes support for satellite and cable television systems, operators of those systems have chosen other technologies (principally DVB-S or proprietary systems for satellite and 256QAM replacing VSB for cable). Japan uses a third system, closely related to DVB-T, called ISDB-T, which is compatible with Brazil's SBTVD. The People's Republic of China has developed a fourth system, named DMB-T/H.\n\nThe terrestrial ATSC system (unofficially ATSC-T) uses a proprietary Zenith-developed modulation called 8-VSB; as the name implies, it is a vestigial sideband technique. Essentially, analog VSB is to regular amplitude modulation as 8VSB is to eight-way quadrature amplitude modulation. This system was chosen specifically to provide for maximum spectral compatibility between existing analog TV and new digital stations in the United States' already-crowded television allocations system, although it is inferior to the other digital systems in dealing with multipath interference; however, it is better at dealing with impulse noise which is especially present on the VHF bands that other countries have discontinued from TV use, but are still used in the U.S. There is also no hierarchical modulation. After demodulation and error-correction, the 8-VSB modulation supports a digital data stream of about 19.39 Mbit/s, enough for one high-definition video stream or several standard-definition services. See Digital subchannel: Technical considerations for more information.\n\nOn November 17, 2017, the FCC voted 3-2 in favor of authorizing voluntary deployments of ATSC 3.0, which was designed as the successor to the original ATSC \"1.0\", and issued a Report and Order to that effect. Full-power stations will be required to maintain a simulcast of their channels on an ATSC 1.0-compatible signal if they decide to deploy an ATSC 3.0 service.\n\nOn cable, ATSC usually uses 256QAM, although some use 16VSB. Both of these double the throughput to 38.78 Mbit/s within the same 6 MHz bandwidth. ATSC is also used over satellite. While these are logically called ATSC-C and ATSC-S, these terms were never officially defined.\n\nDTMB is the digital television broadcasting standard of the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Macau. This is a fusion system, which is a compromise of different competing proposing standards from different Chinese Universities, which incorporates elements from DMB-T, ADTB-T and TiMi 3.\n\nDVB-T uses coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (COFDM), which uses as many as 8000 independent carriers, each transmitting data at a comparatively low rate. This system was designed to provide superior immunity from multipath interference, and has a choice of system variants which allow data rates from 4 MBit/s up to 24 MBit/s. One US broadcaster, Sinclair Broadcasting, petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to permit the use of COFDM instead of 8-VSB, on the theory that this would improve prospects for digital TV reception by households without outside antennas (a majority in the US), but this request was denied. (However, one US digital station, WNYE-DT in New York, was temporarily converted to COFDM modulation on an emergency basis for datacasting information to emergency services personnel in lower Manhattan in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks).\n\nDVB-S is the original Digital Video Broadcasting forward error coding and modulation standard for satellite television and dates back to 1995. It is used via satellites serving every continent of the world, including North America. DVB-S is used in both MCPC and SCPC modes for broadcast network feeds, as well as for direct broadcast satellite services like Sky and Freesat in the British Isles, Sky Deutschland and HD+ in Germany and Austria, TNT SAT/FRANSAT and CanalSat in France, Dish Network in the US, and Bell TV in Canada. The MPEG transport stream delivered by DVB-S is mandated as MPEG-2.\n\nDVB-C stands for Digital Video Broadcasting - Cable and it is the DVB European consortium standard for the broadcast transmission of digital television over cable. This system transmits an MPEG-2 family digital audio/video stream, using a QAM modulation with channel coding.\n\nISDB is very similar to DVB, however it is broken into 13 subchannels. Twelve are used for TV, while the last serves either as a guard band, or for the 1seg (ISDB-H) service. Like the other DTV systems, the ISDB types differ mainly in the modulations used, due to the requirements of different frequency bands. The 12 GHz band ISDB-S uses PSK modulation, 2.6 GHz band digital sound broadcasting uses CDM and ISDB-T (in VHF and/or UHF band) uses COFDM with PSK/QAM. It was developed in Japan with MPEG-2, and is now used in Brazil with MPEG-4. Unlike other digital broadcast systems, ISDB includes digital rights management to restrict recording of programming.\n\nAs interlaced systems require accurate positioning of scanning lines, it is important to make sure that the horizontal and vertical timebase are in a precise ratio. This is accomplished by passing the one through a series of electronic divider circuits to produce the other. Each division is by a prime number.\n\nTherefore, there has to be a straightforward mathematical relationship between the line and field frequencies, the latter being derived by dividing down from the former. Technology constraints of the 1930s meant that this division process could only be done using small integers, preferably no greater than 7, for good stability. The number of lines was odd because of 2:1 interlace. The 405 line system used a vertical frequency of 50 Hz (Standard AC mains supply frequency in Britain) and a horizontal one of 10,125 Hz (50 × 405 ÷ 2)\n\n\n\nConverting between different numbers of lines and different frequencies of fields/frames in video pictures is not an easy task. Perhaps the most technically challenging conversion to make is from any of the 625-line, 25-frame/s systems to system M, which has 525-lines at 29.97 frames per second. Historically this required a frame store to hold those parts of the picture not actually being output (since the scanning of any point was not time coincident). In more recent times, conversion of standards is a relatively easy task for a computer.\n\nAside from the line count being different, it's easy to see that generating 59.94 fields every second from a format that has only 50 fields might pose some interesting problems. Every second, an additional 10 fields must be generated seemingly from nothing. The conversion has to create new frames (from the existing input) in real time.\n\nThere are several methods used to do this, depending on the desired cost and conversion quality. The simplest possible converters simply drop every 5th line from every frame (when converting from 625 to 525) or duplicate every 4th line (when converting from 525 to 625), and then duplicate or drop some of those frames to make up the difference in frame rate. More complex systems include inter-field interpolation, adaptive interpolation, and phase correlation.\n\n\nTransmission technology standards\n\nDefunct analog systems\n\nAnalog television systems\n\nAnalog television system audio\n\nDigital television systems\n\nHistory\n\n"}

In his wartime lectures, he compared its operation to the contemporary newspapers, where blanks would reveal first-hand the work of the censor, but where allusions, circumlocutions, and other softening techniques also showed attempts to work round the censorship of thoughts in advance. He went on to characterise the motivating force, which he called \"the self-observing agency as the ego-censor [\"censor\"], the conscience; it is this that exercises the dream-censorship [\"censur\"] during the night, from which the repressions of inadmissable wishful impulses proceed\".\n\nAnother tool used by the dream-censorship was regression to archaic symbolic forms of expression unfamiliar to the conscious mind. Where all such measures of censorship failed, however, the result could be the development of nightmares and insomnia.\n\nFreud found the same effects of disguise and omission taking place in the construction of neurotic symptoms, under the influence of the censorship, as in dreams.

It was once spoken among Central Asia's numerous settled and nomadic Arab communities, which inhabited areas in Samarqand, Bukhara, Qashqadarya, Surkhandarya (present-day Uzbekistan), and Khatlon (present-day Tajikistan), as well as Afghanistan. The first wave of Arabs migrated to this region in the 8th century during the Muslim conquests and was later joined by groups of Arabs from Balkh and Andkhoy (present-day Afghanistan). Owing to heavy Islamic influences, Arabic quickly became the common language of science and literature of the epoch. Most Central Asian Arabs lived in isolated communities and did not favour intermarriages with the local population. This factor helped their language survive in a multilingual milieu until the 20th century. By the 1880s many Arab pastoralists had migrated to northern Afghanistan from what is now Uzbekistan and Tajikistan following the Russian conquest of Central Asia. These Arabs nowadays speak no Arabic having adapted to Dari and Uzbek. \n\nWith the establishment of the Soviet rule in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, Arab communities faced major linguistic and identity changes having had to abandon nomadic lifestyles and gradually mixing with Uzbeks, Tajiks and Turkmen. According to the 1959 census, only 34% of Soviet Arabs, mostly elderly, spoke their language at a native level. Others reported Uzbek or Tajik as their mother tongue. \n\nNowadays Central Asian Arabic (heavily influenced by the local languages in phonetics, vocabulary and syntax) is spoken in 5 villages of Surkhandarya, Qashqadarya and Bukhara. In Uzbekistan, there are at least two dialects of Central Asian Arabic: Bukharian (influenced by Tajik) and Qashqadaryavi (influenced by Turkic languages). These dialects are not mutually intelligible. In Tajikistan, Central Asian Arabic is spoken by 35.7% of the country's Arab population, having been largely replaced by Tajik.\n\nGiorgi Tsereteli and Isaak Natanovich Vinnikov w:ru:Винников, Исаак Натанович were responsible for the first academic studies of Central Asian Arabic.\n\nRecent studies considered Khorasani Arabic (spoken in Khorasan, Iran) as part of the Central Asian Arabic family, and found that it was closely related to Qashqadaryavi.\n\n"}

It is an extended version of his first doctoral dissertation, written before the author had seriously undertaken the study of mathematics. The booklet was reissued without Leibniz' consent in 1690, which prompted him to publish a brief explanatory notice in the \"Acta Eruditorum\". During the following years he repeatedly expressed regrets about its being circulated as he considered it immature. Nevertheless it was a very original work and it provided the author the first glimpse of fame among the scholars of his time.\n\nThe main idea behind the text is that of an alphabet of human thought, which is attributed to Descartes. All concepts are nothing but combinations of a relatively small number of simple concepts, just as words are combinations of letters. All truths may be expressed as appropriate combinations of concepts, which can in turn be decomposed into simple ideas, rendering\nthe analysis much easier. Therefore, this alphabet would provide a logic of invention, opposed to that of demonstration which was known so far. Since all sentences are composed of a subject and a predicate, one might\n\n\nFor this, Leibniz was inspired in the \"Ars Magna\" of Ramon Llull, although he criticized this author because of the arbitrariness of his categories and his indexing.\n\nLeibniz discusses in this work some combinatorial concepts. He had read Clavius' comments to the Tractatus de Sphaera of Sacrobosco, and some other contemporary works. He introduced the term \"variationes ordinis\" for the permutations, \"combinationes\" for the combinations of two elements, \"con3nationes\" (shorthand for \"conternationes\") for those of three elements, etc. His general term for combinations was \"complexions\". He found the formula\n\nwhich he thought was original.\n\nThe first examples of use of his ars combinatoria are taken from law, the musical registry of an organ, and the Aristotelian theory of generation of elements from the four primary qualities. But philosophical applications are of greater importance. He cites the idea of Thomas Hobbes that all reasoning is just a computation.\n\nThe most careful example is taken from geometry, from where we shall give some definitions. He introduces the Class I concepts, which are primitive.\n\n\nClass II contains simple combinations.\n\n\nWhere των means \"of the\" (from ). Thus, \"Quantity\" is the number of the parts. Class III contains the \"con3nationes\":\n\n\nThus, \"Interval\" is the space included in total. Of course, concepts deriving from former classes may also be defined.\n\n\nWhere 1/3 means the first concept of class III. Thus, a \"line\" is the interval of (between) points.\n\nLeibniz compares his system to the Chinese and Egyptian languages, although he did not really understand them at this point. For him, this is a first step towards the Characteristica Universalis, the perfect language which would provide a direct representation of ideas along with a calculus for the philosophical reasoning.\n\nAs a preface, the work begins with a proof of the existence of God, cast in geometrical form, and based on the Argument from Motion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54396537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54396537", "title": "Developmental language disorder", "text": "Developmental language disorder\n\nDevelopmental language disorder (DLD) is identified when a child has problems with language development that continue into school age and beyond. The language problems have a significant impact on everyday social interactions or educational progress, and occur in the absence of autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability or a known biomedical condition. The most obvious problems are difficulties in using words and sentences to express meanings, but for many children, understanding of language (receptive language) is also a challenge, although this may not be evident unless the child is given a formal assessment.\n\nThe term developmental language disorder (DLD) was endorsed in a consensus study involving a panel of experts (CATALISE Consortium) in 2017... The study was conducted in response to concerns that a wide range of terminology was used in this area, with the consequence that there was poor communication, lack of public recognition, and in some cases children were denied access to services. Developmental language disorder is a subset of language disorder, which is itself a subset of the broader category of speech, language and communication needs (SLCN).\n\nThe terminology for children’s language disorders has been extremely wide-ranging and confusing, with many labels that have overlapping but not necessarily identical meanings. In part this confusion reflected uncertainty about the boundaries of DLD, and the existence of different subtypes. Historically, the terms ‘’developmental dysphasia’’ or ‘’developmental aphasia’’ were used to describe children with the clinical picture of DLD. These terms have, however, largely been abandoned, as they suggest parallels with adult acquired aphasia. This is misleading, as DLD is not caused by brain damage.\n\nAlthough the term DLD has been used for many years, it has been less common than the term Specific language impairment (SLI), which has been widely adopted, especially in North America. The definition of SLI overlaps with DLD, but was rejected by the CATALISE panel because it was seen as overly restrictive in implying that the child had relatively pure problems with language in the absence of any other impairments. Children with such selective problems are relatively rare, and there is no evidence that they respond differently to intervention, or have different causal factors, from other children with language problems.\n\nIn the UK education system the term Speech, Language and Communication Needs (SLCN) is widely used, but this is far broader than DLD, and includes children with speech, language and social communication difficulties arising from a wide range of causes.\n\nThe question of whether to refer to children's language problems as ‘disorder’ was a topic of debate among the CATALISE consortium, but the conclusion was that ‘disorder’ conveyed the serious nature and potential consequences of persistent language deficits. It is also parallel with other neurodevelopmental conditions and consistent with diagnostic frameworks such as DSM5 and ICD-11. Where there are milder or more transient difficulties, language difficulties may be a more appropriate term.\n\nDLD can affect a range of areas of language and the degree of impairment in different areas of language can vary from child to child. However, although there have been attempts to define different subtypes, these have not generally resulted in robust categories. The recommendation of the CATALISE panel was that the specific areas of impairment should be assessed and documented for individual children, while recognizing that different children might have different combinations of problems. The areas which can be affected are:\n\nSpeech is the act of articulating sounds, and this can be impaired for all kinds of reasons – a structural problem such as cleft lip and cleft palate, a neurological problem affecting motor control of the speech apparatus Dysarthria, or inability to perceive distinctions between sounds because of Hearing loss. Some distortions of speech sounds, such as a Lisp, are commonly seen in young children. These misarticulations should not be confused with language problems, which involve the ability to select and combine linguistic elements to express meanings, and the ability to comprehend meanings. \nAlthough speech disorders can be distinguished from language disorders, they can also co-occur. When a child fails to produce distinctions between speech sounds for no obvious reason, this is typically regarded as a language problem affecting the learning of phonological contrasts. The classification of and terminology for disorders of speech sound production is a subject of considerable debate. In practice, even for those with specialist skills, it is not always easy to distinguish between phonological disorders and other types of speech production problem.\nSpeech sound disorder (SSD) is any problem with speech production arising from any cause. \nSpeech Sound Disorders of unknown cause that are not accompanied by other language problems are a relatively common reason for young children to be referred to speech-language therapy (speech-language pathology). These often resolve by around 4–5 years of age with specialist intervention, and so would not meet criteria for DLD. Where such problems continue beyond 5 years of age, they are usually accompanied by problems in broader language domains and have a poorer prognosis, so a diagnosis of DLD with SSD is then appropriate.\n\nDLD often co-occurs with milder neurodevelopmental disorders of unknown origin, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental dyslexia or developmental co-ordination disorder. These do not preclude a diagnosis of DLD, but should be noted as co-occurring conditions.\n\nIt is generally accepted that DLD is strongly influenced by genetic factors. The best evidence comes from the Twin study method. Two twins growing up together are exposed to the same home environment, yet may differ radically in their language skills. Such different outcomes are, however, much more common in fraternal (non-identical) twins, who are genetically different. Identical twins share the same genes and tend to be much more similar in language ability. There can be some variation in the severity and persistence of DLD in identical twins, indicating that non-genetic factors affect the course of disorder, but it is unusual to find a child with DLD who has an identical twin with typical language.\n\nThere was considerable excitement when a large, multigenerational family with a high rate of DLD were found to have a mutation of the FOXP2 gene just in the affected family members. However, subsequent studies have found that, though DLD runs in families, it is not usually caused by a mutation in FOXP2 or another specific gene. Current evidence suggests that there are many different genes that can influence language learning, and DLD results when a child inherits a particularly detrimental combination of risk factors, each of which may have only a small effect. Nevertheless, study of the mode of action of the FOXP2 gene has helped identify other common genetic variants involved in the same neural pathways that may play a part in causing DLD.\n\nLanguage disorders are associated with aspects of home environment, and it is often assumed that this is a causal link, with poor language stimulation leading to weak language skills. Twin studies, however, show that two children in the same home environment can have very different language outcomes, suggesting we should consider other explanations for the link. Children with DLD often grow up into adults who have relatively low educational attainments, and their children may share a genetic risk for language disorder.\n\nOne non-genetic factor that is known to have a specific impact on language development is being a younger sibling in a large family.\n\nIt has long been noted that males are more affected by DLD than females, with a sex ratio of affected males: females around 3 or 4:1 However, the sex difference is much less striking in epidemiological samples, suggesting that similar problems may exist in females but are less likely to be detected. The reason for the sex difference is not well understood.\n\nPoor motor skills are commonly found in children with DLD.\n\nBrain scans do not usually reveal any obvious abnormalities in children with DLD, although quantitative comparisons have found differences in brain size or relative proportions of white or grey matter in specific regions. In some cases, unusual brain gyri are found. To date, no consistent 'neural signature' for DLD has been found, although some studies have noted evidence for involvement of subcortical systems. Differences in the brains of children with DLD vs typically developing children are subtle and may overlap with atypical patterns seen in other neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nDLD is defined purely in behavioural terms: there is no biological test. There are three points that need to be met for a diagnosis of DLD:\nFor research and epidemiological purposes, specific cutoffs on language assessments have been used to document the first criterion. Tomblin et al. proposed the EpiSLI criterion, based on five composite scores representing performance in three domains of language (vocabulary, grammar, and narration) and two modalities (comprehension and production). Children scoring in the lowest 10% on two or more composite scores are identified as having language disorder.\n\nThe second criterion, persistence of language problems, can be difficult to judge in a young child, but longitudinal studies have shown that difficulties are less likely to resolve for children who have poor language comprehension, rather than difficulties confined to expressive language. In addition, children with isolated difficulties in just one of the areas noted under 'subtypes' tend to make better progress than those whose language is impaired in several areas.\n\nThe third criterion specifies that DLD is used for children whose language disorder is not part of another biomedical condition, such as a genetic syndrome, a sensorineural hearing loss, neurological disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder or Intellectual Disability – these were termed 'differentiating conditions' by the CATALISE panel. Language disorders occurring with these conditions need to be assessed and children offered appropriate intervention, but a terminological distinction is made so that these cases would be diagnosed as Language Disorder associated with <mark>___</mark>, with the main diagnosis being specified: e.g. \"Language Disorder associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\" The reasoning behind these diagnostic distinctions is discussed further by Bishop (2017).\n\nAssessment will usually include an interview with the child’s caregiver, observation of the child in an unstructured setting, a hearing test, and standardized tests of language. There is a wide range of language assessments in English. Some are restricted for use by experts in speech-language pathology: speech and language therapists (SaLTs/SLTs) in the UK, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in the US and Australia. A commonly used test battery for diagnosis of DLD is the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF). \nAssessments that can be completed by a parent or teacher can be useful to identify children who may require more in-depth evaluation. The Children’s Communication Checklist (CCC–2) is a parent questionnaire suitable for assessing everyday use of language in children aged 4 years and above who can speak in sentences. \nInformal assessments, such as language samples, are often used by speech-language therapists/pathologists to complement formal testing and give an indication of the child's language in a more naturalistic context. A language sample may be of a conversation or narrative retell. In a narrative language sample, an adult may tell the child a story using a wordless picture book (e.g. Frog Where Are You?, Mayer, 1969), then ask the child to use the pictures and tell the story back. Language samples can be transcribed using computer software such as the Systematic Analysis of Language Software, and then analyzed for a range of features: e.g., the grammatical complexity of the child's utterances, whether the child introduces characters to their story or jumps right in, whether the events follow a logical order, and whether the narrative includes a main idea or theme and supporting details.\n\nTreatment is usually carried out by speech and language therapists/pathologists, who use a wide range of techniques to stimulate language learning. In the past, there was a vogue for drilling children in grammatical exercises, using imitation and elicitation, but such methods fell into disuse when it became apparent that there was little generalisation to everyday situations. Contemporary approaches to enhancing development of language structure, for younger children at least, are more likely to adopt 'milieu' methods, in which the intervention is interwoven into natural episodes of communication, and the therapist builds on the child's utterances, rather than dictating what will be talked about. Interventions for older children, may be more explicit, telling the children what areas are being targeted and giving explanations regarding the rules and structures they are learning, often with visual supports.\n\nIn addition, there has been a move away from a focus solely on grammar and phonology toward interventions that develop children's social use of language, often working in small groups that may include typically developing as well as language-impaired peers.\n\nAnother way in contemporary remediation differ from the past is that parents are more likely to be directly involved, but this approach is largely used with preschool children, rather than those whose problems persist into school age.,\n\nFor school-aged children, teachers are increasingly involved in intervention, either in collaboration with speech and language therapists/pathologists, or as the main agents of delivery of the intervention. Evidence for the benefits of a collaborative approach is emerging, but the benefits of asking education staff to be the main deliverers of SLT intervention (the “consultative” approach) are unclear. When SLT intervention is delivered indirectly by trained SLT assistants, however, there are indications that this can be effective.\n\nA radically different approach has been developed by Tallal and colleagues, who devised a computer-based intervention, FastForWord, that involves prolonged and intensive training on specific components of language and auditory processing. The theory underlying FastForword maintains that language difficulties are caused by a failure to make fine-grained auditory discriminations in the temporal dimension, and the computerised training materials are designed to sharpen perceptual acuity. However, a systematic review of clinical trials assessing FastForWord reported no significant gains relative to a control group.\n\nIn this field, Randomized controlled trial methodology has not been widely used, and this makes it difficult to assess clinical efficacy with confidence. Children's language will tend to improve over time, and without controlled studies, it can be hard to know how much of observed change is down to a specific treatment. There is, however, increasing evidence that direct 1:1 intervention with an SLT/P can be effective for improving vocabulary and expressive language. There have been few studies of interventions that target receptive language, though some positive outcomes have been reported.,\n\nLongitudinal studies indicate that problems are largely resolved by 5 years of age in around 40% of 4-year-olds with early language delays who have no other presenting risk factors. However, for children who still have significant language difficulties at school entry, reading problems are common, even for children who receive specialist help, and educational attainments are typically poor. Poor outcomes are most common in cases where comprehension as well as expressive language is affected. There is also evidence that scores on tests of nonverbal ability of children with DLD decrease over the course of development.\n\nDLD is associated with an elevated risk of social, emotional and mental health concerns. For instance, in a UK survey, 64% of a sample of 11-year-olds with DLD scored above a clinical threshold on a questionnaire for psychiatric difficulties, and 36% were regularly bullied, compared with 12% of comparison children. In the longer-term, studies of adult outcomes of children with DLD have found elevated rates of unemployment, social isolation and psychiatric disorder among those with early comprehension difficulties. However, better outcomes are found for children who have milder difficulties and do not require special educational provision.\n\nEpidemiological surveys, in the US and the UK converge in estimating the prevalence of DLD in 5-year-olds at around 7 percent.\n\nMuch research has focused on trying to identify what makes language learning so hard for some children. A major divide is between theories that attribute the difficulties to a low-level problem with auditory temporal processing, and those that propose there is a deficit in a specialised language-learning system.. Other accounts emphasise deficits in specific aspects of learning and memory.. It can be difficult to choose between theories because they do not always make distinctive predictions, and there is considerable heterogeneity among children with DLD. It has also been suggested that DLD may only arise when more than one underlying deficit is present.\n\n\n\n"}

The approach has been developed based on the theoretical work of George Herbert Mead and Bakhtin.\n\nDialogism makes several assumptions. It assumes that human communication entails the interaction of diverse perspectives and is embedded in a socio-historical context, that the meaning of a communication can be different to the various participants, that it is important to examine the consequences of a communication, and that each participant in a communication is, to some degree, orienting to the orientation of the other.\n\nDialogical analysis is an interpretative methodology which closely analyzes spoken or written utterances or actions for their embedded communicative significance. Questions typically asked during a dialogical analysis include: What does each interactant think about themselves, the other and what the other thinks of them? What do the given utterances and actions imply about the given activity or participants? Why was a given communicative act performed – why did it need to be said? What was the alternative that the utterance was trying to dispel? People are often borrowing words, phrases and ideas from other people, and accordingly, dialogical analysis often asks: who is doing the talking? Specifically, which voices and echoes are evident in the given utterance?\n\nAlthough dialogical analysis tends to focus on discourse, it is distinct from discourse analysis and conversation analysis because its focus goes beyond the question of how people speak and what they achieve by speaking. Dialogical analysis uses dialogue as a metaphor for understanding phenomena beyond communication itself, such as the self (see dialogical self), internal dialogues, self-talk, misunderstandings, trust and distrust, the production of knowledge, and relations between groups in society.\n\nRecently there have been attempts to formalize the move from dialogism, which is often quite theoretical, to a systematic methodology for data analysis. These approaches focus upon 'sensitizing questions' that facilitate a dialogical analysis and step-by-step procedures for analyzing multivoicedness.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "238972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238972", "title": "Dip pen", "text": "Dip pen\n\nA dip pen or \"nib pen\" usually consists of a metal nib with capillary channels like those of fountain-pen nibs, mounted in a handle or holder, often made of wood. Other materials can be used for the holder, including bone, metal, and plastic; some pens are made entirely of glass. Generally, dip pens have no ink reservoir, so the user must recharge the ink from an ink bowl or bottle to continue drawing or writing. There are simple, tiny tubular reservoirs that illustrators sometimes clip onto dip pens, which allow drawing for several minutes without recharging the nib. Recharging can be done by dipping into an inkwell, but it is also possible to charge the pen with an eyedropper, a syringe, or a brush, which gives more control over the amount of ink applied. Thus, \"dip pens\" are not necessarily dipped; many illustrators call them \"nib pens\".\n\nDip pens emerged in the early 19th century, when they replaced quill pens and, in some parts of the world, reed pens. Dip pens were generally used before the development of fountain pens in the later 19th century, and are now mainly used in illustration, calligraphy, and comics.\n\nThe dip pen has certain advantages over a fountain pen. It can use waterproof, pigmented, particle-and-binder-based inks, such as India ink, drawing ink, and acrylic inks—each of which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging it—and the traditional iron gall ink, which can corrode fountain pens. Dip pens are also more sensitive to variations of pressure and speed, producing a line that naturally varies in thickness; and they can also produce a finer line than any fountain pen.\n\nThere is a wide range of exchangeable nibs for dip pens, so different types of lines and effects can be created. The nibs and handles are far cheaper than most fountain pens, and allow color changes much more easily.\n\nThe earliest known split-nib metal dip pen is a surviving copper-alloy pen found in Roman Britain ( 43 to 410). Several other surviving all-metal and removable-nib pens from the Middle Ages and Renaissance have been found, suggesting they were used alongside quill pens.\n\nThe steel pen is first attested in Daniel Defoe's book \"A Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain – 1724–26\". In Letter VII Defoe wrote: \"the plaster of the ceilings and walls in some rooms is so fine, so firm, so entire, that they break it off in large flakes, and it will bear writing on it with a pencil or steel pen.\" In Newhall Street, John Mitchell pioneered mass production of steel pens in 1822; prior to that the quill pen had been the most common form of writing instrument. His brother William Mitchell later set up his own pen making business in St Paul's square. The Mitchell family is credited as being the first manufacturers to use machines to cut pen nibs, which greatly sped up the process.\n\nThe Jewellery Quarter and surrounding area of Birmingham, England was home to many of the first dip pen manufacturers, which some companies establishing there to produce pens. Some of those companies were Joseph Gillott's (established in 1827), Sir Josiah Mason (1827), Hink Wells & Co. (1836), Baker and Finnemore (1850), C. Brandauer & Co. (1850), D. Leonardt & Co. (1856).\n\nBaker and Finnemore operated in James Street, near St Paul's Square. C Brandauer & Co Ltd., founded as Ash & Petit, traded at 70 Navigation Street. Joseph Gillott & Sons Ltd. made pen nibs in Bread Street, now Cornwall Street. Hinks Wells & Co. traded in Buckingham Street, Geo W Hughes traded in St Paul's Square, D. Leonardt & Co./Leonardt & Catwinkle traded in George Street and Charlotte Street, and M Myers & Son. were based at 8 Newhall Street. By 1830 John and William Mitchell, Joseph Gillott, and Josiah Mason were the major manufacturers in Birmingham.\nIn Germany the industrial production of dip pens started in 1842 at the factory of Heintze & Blanckertz in Berlin.\n\nBy the 1850s, Birmingham existed as a world centre for steel pen and steel nib manufacture. More than half the steel nib pens manufactured in the world were Birmingham-made. Thousands of skilled craftsmen and women were employed in the industry. Many new manufacturing techniques were perfected in Birmingham, enabling the city's factories to mass-produce their pens cheaply and efficiently. These were sold worldwide to many who previously could not afford to write, which encouraged the development of education and literacy. By 1860 there were about 100 companies making steel nibs in Birmingham, but 12 large firms dominated the trade. In 1870 Mason, Sommerville, Wiley, and Perry, merged to form Perry & Co. Ltd. which later became one of the largest manufacturers in the world, with near 2,000 employees.\nRichard Esterbrook manufactured quill pens in Cornwall. In the 19th century, he saw a gap in the American market for steel nib pens. Esterbrook approached five craftsmen who worked for John Mitchell in Navigation Street with a view to setting up business in Camden, New Jersey, US. Esterbrook founded his company in 1858, and it grew to become one of the largest steel pen manufacturers in the world. In 1971 it went out of business.\n\nThe oblique dip pen was designed for writing the pointed pen styles of the mid 19th to the early 20th century such as Spencerian Script, although oblique pen holders can be used for earlier styles of pointed penmanship such as the copperplate scripts of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the name suggests, the nib holder holds the nib at an oblique angle of around 55° pointing to the right hand side of the penman. This feature helps greatly in achieving the steep angle required for writing certain scripts, but more importantly, it prevents the right hand nib tine from dragging on the paper as can be experienced when using a straight nib holder with a straight nib for this purpose.\n\nThe decreasing production of dip pens and the subsequent demise of the industry in Birmingham is often blamed on the invention of the ballpoint pen in 1938 by the Hungarian Laszlo Biro.\n\nOne improved version of the dip pen, known as the original \"ballpoint\", was the addition of a curved point (instead of a sharp point) which allows the user to have slightly more control on upward and sideways strokes. This feature, however, produces a thicker line rather than the razor-sharp line produced by a sharp point.\n\nSome of the more prominent dip pen manufacturers (in past and present time) are:\n\nDip pens continued in use in schools into the 1950s and 1960s, mainly on grounds of cost, since fountain pens were expensive to buy. Even when ballpoint pens became cheaply available, some schools banned their use, perhaps because writing with a dip pen had to be done with greater care. School desks were made with a socket for a small ceramic inkwell which had to be refilled on a daily basis, a task often delegated to one of the pupils.\n\nDip pens are rarely used now for regular writing, most commonly having been replaced by fountain pens, rollerball pens, or ballpoint pens. However, dip pens are still appreciated by artists, as they can make great differences between thick and thin lines, and generally write more smoothly than other types of pens. Dip pens are also preferred by calligraphers for fine writing. Dip pens are still in use for nib paintings, mostly round tip ones with a slit in the centre. \n\nAlthough most of the factories ceased manufacturing dip pens, some companies are still active, such as Speedball, Brause (currently owned by French company Exacompta Clairefontaine), D. Leonardt & Co., William Mitchell and Joseph Gillott's.\n\n\n"}

For example, if a color sample has the property labelled 'green', then the color sample exemplifies green. At its most basic, possession of a property amounts to being correctly referred to by its label. In other words, an entity, 'x' can be said to possess a certain property if and only if: (1) there can be an abstract singular term which denotes that property, and (2) those assertions are true which predicate such an abstract term of a name or phrase denoting x. \n\nReference is the relation between something \"standing for\" something else, like the relation between a word and what it denotes. Usually reference goes in one direction, from the word to what it denotes, but it may also go in both directions, from the denoted back to the word. For instance, when a patch of green paint is used as a colour sample. The sample refers to green by possessing it and thus being referred to by the word denoting it. The sample exemplifies green, it stands for it, and in this way exemplification is a mode of reference.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The parties in the case are the Fox Broadcasting Company (supported by other television networks including ABC, CBS, and NBC) and the FCC. A federal appeals court had ruled in the favor of the networks; the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the FCC's appeal.\n\nIn a ruling issued April 28, 2009, the United States Supreme Court ruled to uphold the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fleeting expletive rule. The court reversed a lower court ruling in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York which found in favor of Fox Television that the FCC had not properly followed procedures in creating the rule. In the 5-4 ruling by Justice Antonin Scalia, \"the court did not definitively settle the First Amendment implications of allowing a federal agency to censor broadcasts.\" Instead the court suggested the First Amendment issue should be raised in a Federal Appeals Court.\n\nIn a ruling announced July 13, 2010, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the FCC indecency policy on fleeting expletives. Calling it \"unconstitutionally vague\", the unanimous three judge panel found the policy could infringe upon the constitutionally protected First Amendment freedom of speech. According to the panel, the policy \"created a chilling effect that goes far beyond the fleeting expletives at issue here\", in part due to a lack of guidance on what content is considered offensive.\n\nFox released a statement stating, \"We have always felt that the government's position on fleeting expletives was unconstitutional,\" and, \"While we will continue to strive to eliminate expletives from live broadcasts, the inherent challenges broadcasters face with live television, coupled with the human element required for monitoring, must allow for the unfortunate isolated instances where inappropriate language slips through.\"\n\nFCC Chairman Julius Genachowski indicated the commission will be \"reviewing the court's decision in light of our commitment to protect children, empower parents, and uphold the First Amendment.\"\n\nIn June 2012, the Supreme Court rescinded several fines issued by the FCC regarding indecent content, including the Fox case stemming from the 2002 \"Billboard\" Music Awards.

These can be non-structured and non-hierarchical organizations that are run by all members, or by whichever member wishes to do something.\n\nTo cite a specific hypothetical example, a national grassroots organization would place as much decision-making power as possible in the hands of local chapters or common members instead of the head office. The principle is that for democratic power to be best exercised it must be vested in a local community and common members and instead of isolated, atomized individuals, at the top of the organization. Grassroots organizations can inhabit participatory systems. Grassroots systems differ from representative systems that allow local communities or national memberships to elect representatives who then go on to make decisions.\n\nThe difference between the three systems comes down to where they rest on two different axes: the rootedness in a community (grassroots versus national or international); and the ability of all individuals to participate in the shared decision-making process (participatory versus representative.)\n"}
{"id": "18783545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18783545", "title": "Hail Satan", "text": "Hail Satan\n\n\"Hail Satan\", sometimes expressed in a Latinized version as \"Ave Satanas\" (or \"Ave Satana\"), is an expression used by some Satanists to show their dedication to Satan, but has also been used for the purpose of comedy or satire. Believers in backmasking think they can hear \"Hail Satan\" and other messages to Satan in some songs played in reverse, such as \"Walk This Way\" by Aerosmith. The variation \"Ave Satani\", though grammatically incorrect, is sometimes used, likely originating from its use by Jerry Goldsmith in his theme music to \"The Omen\".\n\nSome adherents to a traditional pagan faith (such as the musician Gaahl) have been known to use the phrase to mock Christians or Christianity, using the similarities between Satan as phallic and passionate and pagan fertility-gods such as Freyr in this rhetoric as a disambiguation.\n\nThe phrase \"Hail Satan\" is documented as early as 1808, where it is said in the poem \"The Monk of Cambray\" by an evil monk who uses his pact with Satan to advance in the ranks of the Catholic Church (and finally become Pope).\n\nThe Latin version \"Ave Satanas\" (in its variant spelling \"Ave Sathanas\"), often appears in literature at least from the 1800s, notably in the popular 1895 faustian novel \"The Sorrows of Satan\", and earlier in an 1862 play \"St. Clement's Eve\" (in reference to satanic undertakings supposed to take place at midnight in a district of Paris). After the phrase \"Hail Satan\" appeared in the 1967 book \"Rosemary's Baby\" by Ira Levin and the 1968 film adaptation of it, where it is said by Satanists when they believe Satan's will has been accomplished, and had also appeared in other films and in stock footage, the phrase became part of the common conception of what Satanists say. Some film actors were reluctant to say it, and of those who did some felt they experienced negative life events afterwards, such as divorce.\n\nCoinciding with its appearance in \"Rosemary's Baby\", the phrase became a common greeting and ritual term in the Church of Satan (founded in 1966), both in its English form, \"Hail Satan\", as well as in the Latin version of it, \"Ave Satanas\". When \"Ave Satanas\" was used, it was often preceded by the term \"Rege Satanas\" (\"Reign, Satan\"). (\"Rege Satanas\" can be heard in the video of a widely publicized Church of Satan wedding performed by LaVey on February 1, 1967.) The combination \"Rege Satanas, Ave Satanas, Hail Satan!\" is found as a greeting in early Church of Satan correspondence, as well as in their 1968 recording \"The Satanic Mass\", and ultimately in their 1969 book \"The Satanic Bible\". The same combination also appeared in 1969 in the non-Church of Satan record album by the rock band Coven, in a 13 minute long \"Satanic Mass\" of their own. The use of \"Hail Satan\" by Coven (as well as their use of the sign of the horns and inverted crosses on the same album) was the first time this phrase was used in rock music. The phrase is used in some versions of the Black Mass, where it often accompanies the phrase \"shemhamforash\" and is said at the end of each prayer. This rite was performed by the Church of Satan\nappearing in the documentary \"Satanis\" in 1969. Some occultists accompany it with similar addresses to other gods or figures they revere. Rituals involving the phrase tend to be more likely to be mentioned in the press at Halloween.\n\n\"Ave Satani\", the theme song for \"The Omen\" (1976), written by Jerry Goldsmith, which won him an Academy Award, has a title which is intended to mean \"Hail Satan\" in Latin, in opposition to \"Ave Christi\". (The song contains other Latin phrases inverting Christ, such as \"Ave Versus Christi\", meaning \"Hail Anti-Christ\", and \"Corpus Satani\", an inversion of \"Corpus Christi\", the body of Christ). The song has been described as hair-raising and has inspired cover versions such as those by Fantômas or Gregorian. The music is used in comic portrayals of stock \"sinister\" characters, for instance in the \"South Park\" episode \"Woodland Critter Christmas\", which involves devil-worshiping woodland creatures, a version of the \"Ave Satani\" is heard in the background when the animals use their demonic powers; also the episode's commercial bumpers involving a squirrel saying \"Hail Satan!\" The chant is also parodied in the episode \"Damien\", where Damien is accompanied by the chant \"Rectus Dominus Cheesy Poofs.\"\n\nIn 1985, the phrase received national news coverage in the United States when serial killer Richard Ramirez, known as the \"Night Stalker\", shouted \"Hail Satan!\" as he was led from the courtroom, while raising his hand with a pentagram drawn onto it. Members of Ramirez's family denied that he said the phrase, believing that he said \"We'll see,\" but \"Hail Satan\" was still being used by journalists over twenty years later as being characteristic of Ramirez. In reviewing whether Ramirez was deprived of his due process and right to a fair trial by being restrained by leg shackles, the Supreme Court of California itself highlighted Ramirez's use of \"Hail Satan\" to support its conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Ramirez to be physically restrained during trial.\n\nThe phrase may be used ironically by heavy metal fans as part of their rebellious ethos. Heavy metal musicians may use it as part of their act or their songs, such as \"Hail Satanas We Are the Black Legions\" by Mütiilation. Heavy metal musicians, for instance Ozzy Osbourne, a member of the Church of England, rarely consider themseves to be Satanists, instead using it as part of their stage persona, a role they play. RuPaul's Drag Race Season 4 Winner Sharon Needles has a song called \"Hail Satan\", in which she cites icons from the satanic culture.\nThe ubiquity of the phrase has led to it being used in parodic imitation of evangelism, as with the Mr. Show with Bob and David sketch \"Hail Satan Network\" which includes chaacters who are Satanic televangelists. It received another humorous use when \"The Simpsons\" character Bart Simpson was punished for using it to end the Pledge of Allegiance in the episode \"Burns' Heir\".\n\n\"Hail Satan\" is frequently shouted to the heavens during successful operations and destruction of high value enemy assets by the Goonswarm Federation alliance in the popular space-based MMO, Eve Online.\n\nSome of those who believe in backmasking, along with some Christian fundamentalists, believe messages such as \"Hail Satan\" may subliminally inspire people to do evil, a view which may have received some reinforcement when the phrase was used as part of the vandalizing of churches, but its use then might have been the expression of a general anti-religious sentiment, as suggested by its use along with slogans such as \"Think, don't Pray\". Vandalism accompanying it may include the anarchy symbol or other slogans intended to shock, such as racial slurs. It can accompany symbols such as a swastika, inverted pentagram, or inverted cross. Such vandalism is usually by rebellious young people rather than Satanists, whose activities are not often criminal.\n\nRick Alan Ross, an anti-cultist and deprogrammer, referred to the murder trial of Scott Peterson, in which the defense made the claim that the killings were by a \"Satanic cult\" rather than the defendant. Ross called this a ridiculous manifestation of the Satanic panic, referred to it as a \"Hail Satan Pass\", similar to the Hail Mary pass in football, a desperate and unlikely attempt.\n\n"}

Also, the direct derivation relation ⇒ is defined similar to above. This new class of grammars defines a strictly smaller class of languages, \nwhich belongs to the mildly context-sensitive classes.\n\nThe language { \"www\" : \"w\" ∈ {\"a\",\"b\"} } is generable by an indexed grammar, but not by a linear indexed grammar, while both { \"ww\" : \"w\" ∈ {\"a\",\"b\"} } and { \"a\" \"b\" \"c\" : n ≥ 1 } are generable by a linear indexed grammar.\n\nIf both the original and the modified production rules are admitted, the language class remains the indexed languages.\n\nLetting σ denote an arbitrary collection of stack symbols, we can define a grammar for the language \"L\" = {\"a\" \"b\" \"c\" | \"n\" ≥ 1 } as\n\nTo derive the string \"abc\" we have the steps \"S\"[] ⇒ \"aS\"[\"f\"]\"c\" ⇒ \"aT\"[\"f\"]\"c\" ⇒ \"aT\"[]\"bc\" ⇒ \"abc\".\n\nSimilarly: \"S\"[] ⇒ \"aS\"[\"f\"]\"c\" ⇒ \"aaS\"[\"ff\"]\"cc\" ⇒ \"aaT\"[\"ff\"]\"cc\" ⇒ \"aaT\"[\"f\"]\"bcc\" ⇒ \"aaT\"[]\"bbcc\" ⇒ \"aabbcc\".\n\nThe linearly indexed languages are a subset of the indexed languages, and thus all LIGs can be recoded as IGs, making the LIGs strictly less powerful than the IGs. A conversion from a LIG to an IG is relatively simple. LIG rules in general look approximately like formula_1, modulo the push/pop part of a rewrite rule. The symbols formula_2 and formula_3 represent strings of terminal and/or non-terminal symbols, and any non-terminal symbol in either must have an empty stack, by the definition of a LIG. This is, of course, counter to how IGs are defined: in an IG, the non-terminals whose stacks are not being pushed to or popped from must have exactly the same stack as the rewritten non-terminal. Thus, somehow, we need to have non-terminals in formula_2 and formula_3 which, despite having non-empty stacks, behave as if they had empty stacks.\n\nLet's consider the rule formula_6 as an example case. In converting this to an IG, the replacement for formula_7 must be some formula_8 that behaves exactly like formula_7 regardless of what formula_10 is. To achieve this, we can simply have a pair of rules that takes any formula_8 where formula_10 is not empty, and pops symbols from the stack. Then, when the stack is empty, it can be rewritten as formula_7.\n\nWe can apply this in general to derive an IG from an LIG. So for example if the LIG for the language formula_16 is as follows:\n\nThe sentential rule here is not an IG rule, but using the above conversion algorithm, we can define new rules for formula_22, changing the grammar to:\n\nEach rule now fits the definition of an IG, in which all the non-terminals in the right hand side of a rewrite rule receive a copy of the rewritten symbol's stack. The indexed grammars are therefore able to describe all the languages that linearly indexed grammars can describe.\n\nVijay-Shanker and Weir (1994) demonstrates that Linear Indexed Grammars, Combinatory Categorial Grammars, Tree-adjoining Grammars, and Head Grammars all define the same class of string languages.\nTheir formal definition of linear indexed grammars differs from the above.\n\nLIGs (and their weakly equivalents) are strictly less expressive (meaning they generate a proper subset) than the languages generated by another family of weakly equivalent formalism, which include: LCFRS, MCTAG, MCFG and minimalist grammars (MGs). The latter family can (also) be parsed in polynomial time.\n\nAnother form of indexed grammars, introduced by Staudacher (1993), is the class of Distributed Index grammars (DIGs). What distinguishes DIGs from Aho's Indexed Grammars is the propagation of indexes. Unlike Aho's IGs, which distribute the whole symbol stack to all non-terminals during a rewrite operation, DIGs divide the stack into substacks and distributes the substacks to selected non-terminals.\n\nThe general rule schema for a binarily distributing rule of DIG is the form\n\nWhere α, β, and γ are arbitrary terminal strings. For a ternarily distributing string:\n\nAnd so forth for higher numbers of non-terminals in the right hand side of the rewrite rule. In general, if there are \"m\" non-terminals in the right hand side of a rewrite rule, the stack is partitioned \"m\" ways and distributed amongst the new non-terminals. Notice that there is a special case where a partition is empty, which effectively makes the rule a LIG rule. The Distributed Index languages are therefore a superset of the Linearly Indexed languages.\n\n\n"}

Most works classed as Israeli literature are written in the Hebrew language, although some Israeli authors write in Yiddish, English, Arabic and Russian. \nThe foundations of modern Israel writing were laid by a group of literary pioneers from the Second Aliyah including Shmuel Yosef Agnon, the only Nobel Prize winner for literature in Hebrew and the only one for Israeli literature, Moshe Smilansky, Yosef Haim Brenner, David Shimoni, and Jacob Fichman. Until World War I, Hebrew literature was centered in Eastern Europe. After the war and the Russian Revolution many Hebrew writers found their way to Palestine, so that at the time Palestinian writing was essentially a continuation of the European tradition. In 1921, 70 writers met in Tel Aviv and founded the Hebrew Writers' Association. About this time the first literary periodicals made their appearance—\"Ha-Adamah\", edited by Brenner, and \"Ma'abarot\", edited by Fichman. The 1920 and 1930s witnessed the emergence of Palestine as the dominant center of Hebrew literary activity. Many of the pioneers of Hebrew literature were Zionists, and eventually made their way to Palestine. The great figures of the early part of the century—Bialik, Ahad Ha-Am, Tchernichovsky—all spent their last years in Tel Aviv, and although this was not the period of their greatest creativity, they exerted a great influence on younger Hebrew writers. \n\nAmong the earliest modern Hebrew writers was a small minority of writers who were born in Palestine. This cadre includes Yitzhaq Shami and Yehuda Burla , Sepharadi Jews whose families migrated to Palestine in the 19th and 18th centuries, respectively. The writing of this group stands out for its authentic depiction of the Arab and Jewish population of Palestine, told from the vantage point of those who grew up in its midst.\n\nThe most important writers of the first generation, S.Y. Agnon and Haim Hazaz, were deeply rooted in their European background, and served as links between the classical writers of the early decades of the Hebrew revival and the Hebrew writers in Palestine during the following generations.\n\nFor the next generation of writers, the center of focus was Palestine, even when they were writing about other parts of the world. Their framework was the period of aliyah and, very often, life in the kibbutz. Among the outstanding names are Uri Zvi Greenberg and Avraham Shlonsky, who found in Palestine the antidote to the rootlessness of the Diaspora.\n\nThe third generation of writers emerged around the time of the Israeli war of independence. Its key figures (S. Yizhar, Moshe Shamir, Hanoch Bartov, Haim Gouri, Benjamin Tammuz, Aharon Megged) were all sabras or had been brought to the country at an early age. Strong influences now came in from other countries, especially Western. A group called the \"Canaanites\" even sought to deny the connection between Israelis and Jews elsewhere. But after 1948, a feeling of emptiness and of searching for new values was leading to experiments in exploring the Jewish past. \n\nThe subsequent generation of the 1960s (A. B. Yehoshua, Amos Oz, Natan Yonatan, Yoram Kaniuk, Yaakov Shabtai) has endeavoured to place Israeli culture within a world context and stresses not so much the unique aspects of Jewish life and Israel as the universal. This school of writers often identifies itself with the protest literature of other countries.\n\nThe following generation, writers who were born in the 1960s and 1970s and made their debut in the 1980s and 1990s, examined the basic questions of Jewish-Israeli existence by exposing the collective tensions in individual characters and fates.\n\nApart from Hebrew writers, there is considerable creative productivity in Israel in other languages, notably in Yiddish. Before World War II, Warsaw, Moscow, and New York were the main centers of Yiddish activity. In Palestine there was still a certain hostility to the Yiddish language, which was felt as a challenge to the Hebrew revival. However, with World War II the whole picture changed. The European centers were liquidated by Hitler and Stalin, and the New York center declined. Immigration brought many of the leading Yiddish writers to Israel. Here the internal attitude relaxed and became friendly, in view of the Holocaust in Europe, on the one hand, and the secure position attained by Hebrew, on the other. \n\nYiddish writing in Israel can be marked by generations, similar to those in Hebrew literature. The first consisted of writers such as David Pinski and Sholem Asch, who passed their last years in Israel. The second generation, led by Abraham Sutzkever, started its career in Eastern Europe but continued in Israel. The third generation was centered on \"Young Israel\", a modernist group of poets and prose writers, most of whom are kibbutz members, whose work has been influenced by the avant-garde schools of English and French writing.\n\nYiddish writing in Israel is concentrated on the European Holocaust (the leading writer on this is Ka-Tzetnik), and life among new immigrants. Yiddish authors in Israel are organized in a Yiddish authors' association.\n\nThe presence of Arabic-language literature in Israeli society can be initially attributed to Emile Habibi, an Israeli-Palestinian writer and a communist politician. In 1992, he was awarded the Israel Prize for Arabic literature. A fervent communist, Habibi helped created the Israeli Communist Party and established \"Al-Ittihad\", a communist daily Arabic language newspaper published in Haifa. Habibi's works, while often a critique of Israeli society, are nevertheless part of Israeli culture.\n\nBy law, the Jewish National and University Library of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem receives two copies of each book published in Israel. In 2004 it reported that it received 6,436 new books. Most of them were published in Hebrew, and 89% those books published in Hebrew were original to the Hebrew language. Almost 8% of the 2004 crop were children's books and another 4% were textbooks. According to the type of publisher, the books were 55% commercial, 14% self-published, 10% governmental, 7% educational, and 14% published by other types of organizations. The orthodox and ultra-orthodox sector was responsible for 21% of the total titles. 2017 figures show that 17% of books were Torah-related, 16% were literature and 14% children's books.\n\n\n"}

After the military takeover of the government in 1999, Hashmi reportedly exposed the Pakistan Army's misadventure in Kashmir with the Indian Army when he demanded to constitute the Commission to investigate the events implicated front role of the President Pervez Musharraf in 2003. Briefly sentenced to the solitary confinement by the session court in 2004 over the allegations of treason, Hashmi's sentence was overturn by the Supreme Court when it declared his case hearings as mistrial on 4 August 2007. Initially supporting the impeachment movement against Pervez Musharraf with Nawaz Sharif, he drifted apart from the PML(N) to join the Imran Khan's PTI in 2011 but was ousted after disagreeing with the demonstration against the elected government, which he viewed that it had the support from the military to destabilized the elected Sharif administration in 2014. \n\nWithout the political support, Hashmi lost the byelection and went to join the PML(N) after reconciling his differences on the policy matters with the Nawaz Sharif in 2018. Besides his political career, Hashmi is a prolific writer on geopolitics and geostrategy, and is an author of geopolitical book, \"\"Yes! I'm a Rebel\", where he successfully calculated the danger of the foreign supported homegrown terrorism in Pakistan and precisely placing a prediction on Musharraf government's weakening the state of Pakistan.\n\nJaved Hashmi was born into an agriculturist family on 1 January 1948 in Multan, Punjab in Pakistan. Other sources noted his birthplace in Lahore with same date and year of birth; though, he confirmed his date of birth and year as well as birth place on 1 January 1948 in Multan. His family was known for their participation in the Pakistan Movement and was part of the Muslim League since its inception in 1906.\n\nAfter his matriculation in 1968, Hashmi went to attend the Emerson College in Multan but made a transfer to the Punjab University in Lahore in 1970, where he became involved in student politics on the platform of the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami– a far right party. In 1969, he secured his graduation from the Punjab University with BSc. in Political Science. In 1971, he graduated with MSc in political science, and later attained MPhil in same discipline from the same institution. \n\nIn 1972, he gained public notice when he led his student organization, the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba, in protest of government minister involved in kidnapping of two girls at the Governor's House when Governor of Punjab, Ghulam Mustafa Khar, was hosting a state dinner in honor of President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the visiting British minister. In 1974, he ultimately led strong protests in Lahore against the decision of international recognition of Bangladesh and reportedly breached all security arrangements, to appear right in front of the motorcade of the then Saudi King Shah Faisal. During this time, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto offered him to be appointed on political post at the High Commission of Pakistan in London but he denied the political appointment.\n\nIn 1978, Hashmi was taken in the Zia administration as the Minister of State for Youth and Student Affairs, and was the youngest minister at the age of 29. However, he later expressed his uncomfortableness with working with the uniform officials and soon departed from the administration where he began practicing law at the Lahore High Court while filling the role of agriculturist at his family farms.\n\nDuring the nationwide general elections held in 1985, Hashmi returned to the national politics and successfully participated for NA-149 (Multan-II) constituency on the platform of Pakistan Muslim League (PML). In 1988, he sided with the conservative faction led by its President Fida Mohammad as opposed to nationalist faction led by then-Prime Minister Mohammad Junejo. Hashmi successfully defended his NA-149 (Multan-II) constituency during the general elections held in 1988 and 1990. During this time, Hashmi was elevated as the Minister of State for Youth Affairs in the first administration of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. \n\nIn 1993, his name was subsequently reported in the financial scandal revealed by the Federal Investigation Agency when the agency interrogated Younis Habib, the accountant with the Ministry of Defence. He later expressed his regret and grief when he testified his acceptance of financial endowment from accountant Younis Habib in 1993. \n\nDuring the general elections held in 1997, Hashmi again defended his NA-149 (Multan-II) constituency and was elevated as the Minister of Health and Minister for Environment in the second administration of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and paid the state visit to Morocco in 1999. In 1998, he visited Switzerland to attend the environmental and climate change conference but immediately return to Pakistan after learning of India's nuclear tests in Rajasthan. In an attendance NSC meeting with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Hashmi became a war hawk and greatly spoke in favor of decision-making process of authorizing the nuclear weapons-testing, which eventually, Pakistan conducted out six nuclear weapons-testing in May 1998. At the session at the Parliament, Hashmi reportedly led a celebration while loudly chairing and tapping from his parliament desk: \"Yes! Yes!... We have done it.!\"\n\nHis tenure was abruptly ended when then-Chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf went onto impose martial law against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, and was appointed as Party President of Pakistan Muslim League (N), which he tenured until 2005.\n\nAfter the martial law against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, Hashmi became a vocal critic of former President Pervez Musharraf and strongly advocated for the strong civilian control of the military. In 2001–04, Hashmi reportedly appealed to the Commonwealth of Nations and the European Union to play a significant political role to restore the civilian control of the federal government in Pakistan. In 2001, an inquiry against his role in the Mehrangate scandal was opened by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) but was unable to produce any substantial evidence against him in the accountability courts.\n\nIn 2001, Hashmi led the strong conservative demonstration against President Pervez Musharraf's geostrategy on the War on Terror that led to the U.S. invasion in Afghanistan. During this time, Shuja'at Hussain, the head of the PMLQ) supporting President Musharraf, made an unsuccessful attempt to recruiting him and Nisar Ali Khan into his faction to provide political advocacy for President Musharraf in 2002. In 2002, the PML(N) announced to participate in the nationwide general elections with Hashmi earning the combined nomination from the Opposition alliance in the Parliament for the Prime Minsiterialship against Mir Zafarullah Jamali of the PML(Q); Hashmi later conceded his defeat in the elections due to counting of the electoral college.\n\nOn 20 October 2003, Hashmi reportedly exposed the ethical and monetary corruption in the Pakistani military when he read the letter signed by several active-duty military officers in the Army GHQ in Rawalpindi. He immediately demanded for an active criminal investigations against the chief of army staff and criticisized President Pervez Musharraf for his presidential campaign while in the military uniform. On 29 October 2003, Lt-Gen. Shahid Aziz ordered the NAB agents to detained him from the Parliament Building, and was later taken in the in custody by the Military Police on charges of inciting mutiny leveled by President Pervez Musharraf. Hearings of his trials were held in the Adiala Prison and the session court at the Lahore High Court, which raised doubts among human rights groups about its fairness. On 12 April 2004, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison for inciting mutiny in the military, forgery, and defamation.\n\nThe verdict was widely criticized in Pakistan and was considered as a wilful miscarriage of justice by the Musharraf administration, and the ARD and the MMA termed this verdict to be politically motivated by the ruling junta with malicious intent, declaring him to be a political prisoner. He was transferred and held in the Central Jail Lahore where he penned and authored a critically acclaimed political book, Haan Mein Baghi Hun! (lit. \"Yes, I am Rebel!\") where he exposed the military's intervention in the politics and the foreign relations with the United States. He also authored the Takhtaey-e-Daar Kay Saaey Talay (lit. \"Under the shadow of Hanging board\")..\n\nOn 3 August 2007, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan under Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry granted him bail after serving approximately three and a half years in prison. On 4 August 2007, Hashmi, with among PML(N) leaders, were released but again placed under arrest at the declaration of a state of emergency on 3 November 2007\n\nDuring the general elections held in 2008, Hashmi successfully defended the NA-55 (Rawalpindi-VI) constituency where he notably defeated PML(Q)'s Rashid Ahmed but decided to retain his NA-148 Constituency against the wishes of Nawaz Sharif. He spoke against of the strategic partnership act offered by the United States, and released a very strong reaction on Inter Services Public Relations, which he termed the Kerry-Lugar Bill, an interference on part of Americans in country's intelligence community. He reported quoted: \"if there is anything that needs to be corrected, Pakistan will do it herself. Pakistan Army should stay within its limits... We will protect our military if it ensures playing the role assigned to it.\" Over the issue of the Memogate scandal that implicated the former President Asif Ali Zardari and Parliament's failure for its investigation, Hashmi reportedly Hashmi submitted his resignation from Parliament, claiming that \"this parliament is a dummy and not passing real legislation\" on 7 May 2011.\n\nOn 24 December 2011, Hashmi reportedly cut his tied from the PML(N) and joined the PTI and addressed a rally in support of Imran Khan in Karachi on 25 December 2011. Though, he also warned Imran Khan of his dissenting approach if Imran Khan did not deliver his party's manifesto as promised to the voters. During the general elections held in 2013, Hashmi successfully defended the NA-48 in Islamabad, and NA-149 in Multan on PTI's platform but later relinquished the NA-48 in favor of PTI's worker. He stood against Nawaz Sharif's candidacy in the National Assembly when the vote of confidence measure took place, and reportedly spoke in favor of Nawaz Sharif where he reportedly quoted in the televised conference: \"Political differences aside, Nawaz is my political leader and will remain so.\" His views subsequently blacklashed the party and was said to be at odds with core of the leadership of the PTI, Imran Khan, the Chairman, Mehmood Qureshi, Vice-chairman, and Jehangir Tarin, the Secretary-General.\n\nOn 14 August 2014, Hashmi voiced serious and irreconcilable concerns when Imran Khan decided to lead a massive protests against alleged rigging in the general elections when the decision towards the \"Dharna\" at the Constitution Avenue in Islamabad; though he decided to address the march on Khan's request. On 31 August 2014, Hashmi left the party in distraught and in anger when the Imran Khan's march attacked the media reporters and was violently moved towards the Prime Minister's Secretariat under Khan's orders. On 1 September 2014, Hashmi accused the Pakistan Army of destabilizing the civilian writ of Sharif administration and wasn't well received by Imran Khan who later issued the show cause notice which results in Hashmi leaving the PTI. The PTI later refused to accept his resignation instead Imran Khan ousted him from the party on 26 September 2014.\n\nOn 12 May 2018, Hashmi, alongside with his daughter, met with Nawaz Sharif and announced to rejoin the PML(N) after reconciling the party policy differences with Nawaz Sharif. At this meeting, Hashmi spoke very high of Nawaz Sharif's services done to the country, and reportedly praised his elder daughter, Momoona, and Sharif's daughter, Mary'am, of supporting the political program of the party. \n\nIn 1987, Hashmi successfully predicted the Russian troops retreat from Afghanistan and warming of the Indo-U.S. relations at the expense of Pakistan. He reportedly disagreed with the Pakistan's policy on the Soviet Union, and called for strengthening relations with Russia.\n\nIn his book, \"I'm a Rebel\", Hasmi is of the view towards the national conservatism and wrote a critical view on the performance military governments in Pakistan which have harmed the solidarity of his country and over dependence towards the United States for the political support for their regimes— in desperate for political legitimacy without public approvals, (military) presidents often desperately negotiate with India without formal agenda to seek peace in the region. After learning the news of the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001, Hashmi successfully calculated of imprisonment of PML(N)'s leadership and Musharraf's providing military bases to the United States invasion of Afghanistan, and calculated precisely of Indian support for terrorist organizations in the Western Pakistan. While he sided and agreed with Prime Minister Sharif's policy on India, Hashmi demanded a investigative commission against Chairman joint chiefs Gen. Pervez Musharraf over the Kargil debacle and the self-coup staged by the latter and gave strong criticism to the Lt-Gen. Ehsan ul Haq for his attempts to control the democracy.\n\nJaved Hashmi's elder daughter, Mamoona Hashmi, is a senior leader and currently serving as the member of parliament on the PML(N)'s platform. His younger daughter, Bushra, is not active in politics. On 20 July 2010, Hashmi was hospitalised at Nishtar Hospital after he suffered Brain Hemorrhage, and his body also suffered stroke due to internal bleeding. He was later admitted at the General Hospital for minor fever. Though, his CT angiography reports came out normal.\n\n\n\n"}

This language consists of a substrate of some natural language (for example English) using technical terms and grammatical conventions that are peculiar to mathematical discourse (see Mathematical jargon), supplemented by a highly specialized symbolic notation for mathematical formulas.\n\nLike natural languages in general, discourse using the language of mathematics can employ a scala of registers. Research articles in academic journals are sources for detailed theoretical discussions about ideas concerning mathematics and its implications for society.\n\nHere are some definitions of language:\n\nThese definitions describe language in terms of the following components:\n\nEach of these components is also found in the language of mathematics.\n\nMathematical notation has assimilated symbols from many different alphabets and typefaces. It also includes symbols that are specific to mathematics, such as\n\nMathematical notation is central to the power of modern mathematics. Though the algebra of Al-Khwārizmī did not use such symbols, it solved equations using many more rules than are used today with symbolic notation, and had great difficulty working with multiple variables (which using symbolic notation can simply be called formula_2, etc.). Sometimes formulas cannot be understood without a written or spoken explanation, but often they are sufficient by themselves, and sometimes they are difficult to read aloud or information is lost in the translation to words, as when several parenthetical factors are involved or when a complex structure like a matrix is manipulated.\n\nLike any other profession, mathematics also has its own brand of technical terminology. In some cases, a word in general usage has a different and specific meaning within mathematics—examples are group, ring, field, category, term, and factor. For more examples, see .\n\nIn other cases, specialist terms have been created which do not exist outside of mathematics—examples are tensor, fractal, functor. Mathematical statements have their own moderately complex taxonomy, being divided into axioms, conjectures, theorems, lemmas and corollaries. And there are stock phrases in mathematics, used with specific meanings, such as \", \" and \"without loss of generality\". Such phrases are known as mathematical jargon.\n\nThe vocabulary of mathematics also has visual elements. Diagrams are used informally on blackboards, as well as more formally in published work. When used appropriately, diagrams display schematic information more easily. Diagrams also help visually and aid intuitive calculations. Sometimes, as in a visual proof, a diagram even serves as complete justification for a proposition. A system of diagram conventions may evolve into a mathematical notation – for example, the Penrose graphical notation for tensor products.\n\nThe mathematical notation used for formulas has its own grammar, not dependent on a specific natural language, but shared internationally by mathematicians regardless of their mother tongues. This includes the conventions that the formulas are written predominantly left to right, even when the writing system of the substrate language is right-to-left, and that the Latin alphabet is commonly used for simple variables and parameters. A formula such as\nis understood by Chinese and Syrian mathematicians alike.\n\nSuch mathematical formulas can be a part of speech in a natural-language phrase, or even assume the role of a full-fledged sentence. For example, the formula above, an inequation, can be considered a sentence or an independent clause in which the greater than or equal to symbol has the role of a symbolic verb. In careful speech, this can be made clear by pronouncing \"≥\" as \"is greater than or equal to\", but in an informal context mathematicians may shorten this to \"greater or equal\" and yet handle this grammatically like a verb. A good example is the book title \"Why does ?\"; here, the equals sign has the role of an infinitive.\n\nMathematical formulas can be \"vocalized\" (spoken aloud). The vocalization system for formulas has to be learned, and is dependent on the underlying natural language. For example, when using English, the expression \"\"ƒ\"(\"x\")\" is conventionally pronounced \"eff of eks\", where the insertion of the preposition \"of\" is not suggested by the notation per se. The expression \"formula_4\", on the other hand, is commonly vocalized like \"dee-why-dee-eks\", with complete omission of the fraction bar, in other contexts often pronounced \"over\". The book title \"Why does ?\" is said aloud as \"Why does ee equal em see-squared?\".\n\nCharacteristic for mathematical discourse – both formal and informal – is the use of the inclusive first person plural \"we\" to mean: \"the audience (or reader) together with the speaker (or author)\".\n\nAs is the case for spoken mathematical language, in written or printed mathematical discourse, mathematical expressions containing a symbolic verb, like formula_5, are generally treated as clauses (dependent or independent) in sentences or as complete sentences and are punctuated as such by mathematicians and theoretical physicists. In particular, this is true for \"both\" inline and displayed expressions. In contrast, writers in other natural sciences disciplines may try to avoid using equations within sentences and may treat displayed expressions in the same way as figures or schemes.\n\nAs an example, a mathematician might write: \n\nIn this statement, \"formula_6\" (in which formula_6 is read as \"ay en\" or perhaps, more formally, as \"the sequence ay en\") and \"formula_7\" are treated as nouns, while \"formula_8\" (read: the limit of formula_18 as \"n\" tends to infinity equals 'big A'), \"formula_9\", and \"formula_20\" are read as independent clauses, and \"formula_12\" is read as \"the equation formula_22 equals formula_18 plus formula_24\". Moreover, the sentence ends after the displayed equation, as indicated by the period after \"formula_20\". In terms of typesetting conventions, broadly speaking, standard mathematical functions such as and operations such as as well as punctuation symbols including the various brackets are set in while Latin alphabet variables are set in . Matrices, vectors, and other objects made up of components are set in . (There is some disagreement as to whether the standard constants (e.g., , π, i = (–1)) or the \"d\" in should be italicized. Greek letters are also usually set upright instead of slanted.) There are also a number of conventions for the part of the alphabet from which variable names are chosen. For example, , , , , , are usually reserved for integers, and are often used for complex numbers, while , , , α, β, γ are used for real numbers. The letters , , are frequently used for unknowns to be found or as arguments of a function, while , , are used for coefficients and , , are used as names of functions. These conventions are not hard rules.\n\nDefinitions are signaled by words like \"we call\", \"we say\", or \"we mean\" or by statements like \"An [\"object\"] is [\"word to be defined\"] if [\"condition\"]\" (for example, \"A set is closed if it contains all of its limit points.\"). As a special convention, the word \"if\" in such a definition should be interpreted as \"if and only if\".\n\nTheorems have generally a title or label in bold type, and possibly identify the originator (for example, \"\"). This is immediately followed by the statement of the theorem, usually set in italics. The proof of a theorem is usually clearly delimited, starting with the word \"Proof\" while the end of the proof is indicated by a halmos or another symbol, or by the letters Q.E.D..\n\nMathematics is used by mathematicians, who form a global community composed of speakers of many languages. It is also used by students of mathematics. As mathematics is a part of primary education in almost all countries, almost all educated people have some exposure to pure mathematics. There are very few cultural dependencies or barriers in modern mathematics. There are international mathematics competitions, such as the International Mathematical Olympiad, and international co-operation between professional mathematicians is commonplace.\n\nMathematics is used to communicate information about a wide range of different subjects. Here are three broad categories:\n\n\nMathematics can communicate a range of meanings that is as wide as (although different from) that of a natural language. As English mathematician R.L.E. Schwarzenberger says:\n\nSome definitions of language, such as early versions of Charles Hockett's \"design features\" definition, emphasize the spoken nature of language. Mathematics would not qualify as a language under these definitions, as it is primarily a written form of communication (to see why, try reading Maxwell's equations out loud). However, these definitions would also disqualify sign languages, which are now recognized as languages in their own right, independent of spoken language.\n\nOther linguists believe no valid comparison can be made between mathematics and language, because they are simply too different:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "893696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=893696", "title": "Linguistic universal", "text": "Linguistic universal\n\nA linguistic universal is a pattern that occurs systematically across natural languages, potentially true for all of them. For example, \"All languages have nouns and verbs\", or \"If a language is spoken, it has consonants and vowels.\" Research in this area of linguistics is closely tied to the study of linguistic typology, and intends to reveal generalizations across languages, likely tied to cognition, perception, or other abilities of the mind. The field was largely pioneered by the linguist Joseph Greenberg, who derived a set of forty-five basic universals, mostly dealing with syntax, from a study of some thirty languages.\n\nLinguists distinguish between two kinds of universals: absolute (opposite: statistical, often called tendencies) and implicational (opposite non-implicational). Absolute universals apply to every known language and are quite few in number; an example is \"All languages have pronouns\". An implicational universal applies to languages with a particular feature that is always accompanied by another feature, such as \"If a language has trial grammatical number, it also has dual grammatical number\", while non-implicational universals just state the existence (or non-existence) of one particular feature.\n\nAlso in contrast to absolute universals are tendencies, statements that may not be true for all languages but nevertheless are far too common to be the result of chance. They also have implicational and non-implicational forms. An example of the latter would be \"The vast majority of languages have nasal consonants\". However, most tendencies, like their universal counterparts, are implicational. For example, \"With overwhelmingly greater-than-chance frequency, languages with normal SOV order are postpositional\". Strictly speaking, a tendency is not a kind of universal, but exceptions to most statements called universals can be found. For example, Latin is an SOV language with prepositions. Often it turns out that these exceptional languages are undergoing a shift from one type of language to another. In the case of Latin, its descendant Romance languages switched to SVO, which is a much more common order among prepositional languages.\n\nUniversals may also be bidirectional or unidirectional. In a bidirectional universal two features each imply the existence of each other. For example, languages with postpositions usually have SOV order, and likewise SOV languages usually have postpositions. The implication works both ways, and thus the universal is bidirectional. By contrast, in a unidirectional universal the implication works only one way. Languages that place relative clauses before the noun they modify again usually have SOV order, so pre-nominal relative clauses imply SOV. On the other hand, SOV languages worldwide show little preference for pre-nominal relative clauses, and thus SOV implies little about the order of relative clauses. As the implication works only one way, the proposed universal is a unidirectional one.\n\nLinguistic universals in syntax are sometimes held up as evidence for universal grammar (although epistemological arguments are more common). Other explanations for linguistic universals have been proposed, for example, that linguistic universals tend to be properties of language that aid communication. If a language were to lack one of these properties, it has been argued, it would probably soon evolve into a language having that property.\n\nMichael Halliday has argued for a distinction between descriptive and theoretical categories in resolving the matter of the existence of linguistic universals, a distinction he takes from J.R. Firth and Louis Hjelmslev. He argues that \"theoretical categories, and their inter-relations construe an abstract model of language...; they are interlocking and mutually defining\". Descriptive categories, by contrast, are those set up to describe particular languages. He argues that \"When people ask about 'universals', they usually mean descriptive categories that are assumed to be found in all languages. The problem is there is no mechanism for deciding how much alike descriptive categories from different languages have to be before they are said to be 'the same thing'\"\n\nIn semantics, research into linguistic universals has taken place in a number of ways. Some linguists, starting with Gottfried Leibniz, have pursued the search for a hypothetic irreducible semantic core of all languages. A modern variant of this approach can be found in the natural semantic metalanguage of Anna Wierzbicka and associates. Other lines of research suggest cross-linguistic tendencies to use body part terms metaphorically as adpositions, or tendencies to have morphologically simple words for cognitively salient concepts. The human body, being a physiological universal, provides an ideal domain for research into semantic and lexical universals. In a seminal study, Cecil H. Brown (1976) proposed a number of universals in the semantics of body part terminology, including the following: in any language, there will be distinct terms for , , , , , and ; if there is a distinct term for , there will be a distinct term for ; similarly, if there are terms for , then there are terms for . Subsequent research has shown that most of these features have to be considered cross-linguistic tendencies rather than true universals. Several languages like Tidore and Kuuk Thaayorre lack a general term meaning 'body'. On the basis of such data it has been argued that the highest level in the partonomy of body part terms would be the word for 'person'.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6620428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6620428", "title": "Muzzle flash", "text": "Muzzle flash\n\nMuzzle flash is the visible light of a muzzle blast, which expels high-temperature, high-pressure gases from the muzzle of a firearm. The blast and flash are caused by the combustion products of the gunpowder, and any remaining unburned powder, mixing with the ambient air. The size and shape of the muzzle flash is dependent on the type of ammunition being used and the individual characteristics of firearm and any devices attached to the muzzle (such as a muzzle brake or flash suppressor).\n\nThe muzzle blast is the explosive expansion of propellant gases when the barrel seal previously maintained by the projectile is suddenly removed as the said projectile leaves the muzzle. The blast is often broken down into two components, an auditory component and a non-auditory component. The auditory component, the sound of the gunshot, is important because it can cause hearing loss or give away the gun's position, while the non-auditory component, the overpressure wave, can cause damage to nearby items.\n\nThe sound of a gunshot, also known as the muzzle report, may have two sources: the muzzle blast itself, and any shockwave produced by a transonic or supersonic projectile. Suppressors help to reduce the muzzle report of firearms by providing a larger area for the propellant gas to expand, decelerate and cool before release.\n\nThe overpressure wave from the muzzle blast of a firearm can contain a significant amount of energy because it travels at an extremely high velocity. Residual pressures at the muzzle can be a significant fraction of the peak chamber pressure, especially when slow burning powders or short barrels are used. This energy can also be harnessed by a muzzle brake to reduce the recoil of the firearm, or by a muzzle booster to provide energy to operate the action.\n\nMuzzle blasts can easily exceed sound pressure levels of 140 decibels, which can cause permanent hearing loss even with brief and infrequent exposure. With big guns such as artillery, that danger can extend outwards a significant distance from the muzzle.\n\nThe force of the muzzle blast can cause damage to items near the muzzle, and with artillery, the energy is sufficiently large to cause severe damage to surrounding structures and vehicles. It furthermore can violently raise dust and debris when firing rifles from prone position and so give away the position. Preventive actions may consist in wetting dry ground or covering the area around the muzzle with a tarpaulin.\n\nThe muzzle flash refers to the light emitted by the muzzle blast, both visible light and infrared. Both heat and pressure can result in light being emitted.\n\nMuzzle flash can be broken down into five distinct components.\n\n\nMuzzle flash, particularly the long duration secondary flash, is an inherent problem in most firearms. Due to its brightness, muzzle flash can temporarily blind the shooter, or give away the shooter's location, especially at night. Ingestion of the muzzle flash from aircraft mounted guns has also been implicated in compressor stall and flameout, causing loss of aircraft.\n\nFlash suppressors attempt to suppress the flash mechanically, by interfering with the shock wave using either a cone or a series of slots at the muzzle of the firearm. However, since the primary cause of the secondary flash is combustion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, chemical approaches are also used. In World War I, bags of sodium chloride (table salt) were placed in front of the propellant charges of artillery to suppress the flash. Addition of a few percent of alkali salts to the powder for flash suppression is common, typically salts of potassium such as potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium carbonate, and potassium bicarbonate. In both cases, the salts act as catalysts, and interfere with the hydrogen-oxygen combustion to reduce the muzzle flash. The side effects of the alkali salts is a reduction in power, an increase in smoke, and fouling and corrosion of the firearm and nearby equipment (a significant concern with aircraft guns). Ammonium chloride and ammonium nitrate salts have also been tried with success.\n\nGunfire locators detect muzzle blast with microphones and triangulate the location where the shots were fired. They are commercially available, and have been installed in many high-crime areas of large cities. They provide a fairly precise location of the source of a shot fired outdoors—99% to within or better—and can provide it to police within seconds of a firing.\n\nMuzzle flashes create distinct signatures that can be located using infrared imaging technology. Technology is being developed to detect enemy muzzle flashes before the projectile reaches its target.\n\n\n"}

The term is less current in contemporary psychoanalysis, but still a focus for analytic controversy.\n\nFreud considered such neurosis as impervious to psychoanalytic treatment, as opposed to the transference neurosis where an emotional connection to the analyst was by contrast possible.\n\nFreud originally applied the term \"narcissistic neurosis\" to a range of disorders, including perversion, depression, and psychosis. In the 1920s, however, he came to single out \"illnesses which are based on a conflict between the ego and the super-ego... we would set aside the name of 'narcissistic psycho-neuroses' for disorders of that kind\"—melancholia being the outstanding example.\n\nAbout the same time, in the wake of the work of Karl Abraham, he began to modify to a degree his view on the inaccessibility of narcissistic neurosis to analytic treatment. However his late lectures from the thirties confirmed his opinion of the unsuitability of narcissistic and psychotic conditions for treatment \"to a greater or less extent\"; as did his posthumous 'Outline of Psychoanalysis'.\n\nFrom the twenties onwards, Freud's views of the inaccessibility of the narcissistic neuroses to analytic influence had been challenged, first by Melanie Klein, and then by object relations theorists more broadly.\n\nWhile classical analysts like Robert Waelder would maintain Freud's delimiting standpoint into the sixties, eventually even within ego psychology challenges to the 'off-limits' view of what were increasingly seen as borderline disorders emerged.\n\nRelational psychoanalysis, like Heinz Kohut, would also take a more positive approach to narcissistic neurosis, emphasising the need for a partial or initial participation in the narcissistic illusions.\n\nIn retrospect, Freud's caution may be seen as a result of his unwillingeness to work with the negative transference, unlike the post-Kleinians.\n\n\n\n"}

Stamp collectors began to send mail to each other and to themselves early on, and philatelic mail is known from the late 19th century onward. While some collectors specialize in philatelic covers, especially first day covers and cacheted covers, others regard them as contrived objects that are not reflective of real-world usage, and often will pay a higher price for a cover that represents genuine commercial use. However, mail sent by stamp collectors is no less a genuine article of postage than is mail sent with no concern of seeing the mailed item again. Philatelic covers include mail from first airmail flight and first day of stamp issues ceremonies. Over the years there have been numerous Expositions where special postmarks are made and where a post office is set up where mail can be sent from on the given date of the Expo'. Like any other genuine item of mail these covers include postage stamps and postmarks of the time period and were processed and delivered by an official postal system.

Whether the cover was contrived or not, it is still an item of mail sent through the same postal system as other covers from a given country, with a postage stamp(s) and postmark, and is often more historically significant than covers set with no intention of recovery.\n\nVarious types of covers, usually prepared by collectors, historians or other enthusiasts, have great historical significance and, regardless of the intention for the mailed item, are sometimes noteworthy or famous in their own right.\n\nAmong the most definitive examples of famous or popular philatelic covers is Zeppelin mail. These are covers that were carried aboard zeppelins in the 1930s and bear special postmarks and other special markings. Because the new Zeppelins were the fastest way to get mail delivered across the Atlantic Ocean they carried a great deal of mail. Because of all the fanfare surrounding the Zeppelins most of mail carried aboard were Zeppelin first flight covers. Much of the funding for the Zeppelin delivery system was generated by collectors and other enthusiasts of the period. Because of the fast mail delivery service there was a lot of commercial mail aboard these vessels. Mail service across the Atlantic Ocean was reduced from weeks to a few days. Hindenburg’s 2-1/2 day service was the fastest way to send mail between Europe and North America in 1936.\n\nWith the advent of air travel it wasn't long before airplanes were carrying the mail between distant points about the globe. In the United States and Germany Air Mail delivery was greeted with the same national enthusiasm and fanfare as was experienced with the first trips to the moon by US Astronauts. Consequently, many people sent philatelic mail to themselves or friends that was carried aboard these flights in order to get a souvenir of the historic event. First flight covers carried aboard are very popular and famous in some cases. The first scheduled U.S. Air Mail service began on May 15, 1918, and carried mail from Washington DC to New York City. The type of airplane used was the U.S. Army Curtiss JN-4 \"Jenny\" biplanes flown by army pilots with an intermediate stop in Philadelphia (Bustleton Field). Among those who were on hand for the departure of the first flight from Washington, D.C., were President Woodrow Wilson, U.S. Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. Army Lt. George L. Boyle was selected to pilot aircraft #38262 on the first Northbound flight which, unfortunately, turned out to be a somewhat less than successful initial venture.\n\n"}

Thus, a stunt cock is analogous to a \"stunt man,\" who anonymously does dangerous live-action sequences in place of the main actor. However, a stunt cock seldom performs dangerous acts on film. Though the term draws its name from this term, its practical application is more analogous to a body double.\n\nStunt cock work is a very common \"workhorse\" position in the pornography industry. The majority of prominent male pornographic actors have worked in this capacity at least once. Some actors work as stunt cocks specifically out of a desire for anonymity.\n\nWork on a pornographic film can be very demanding, and it is often difficult for actors to perform on demand as needed. A common function of a stunt cock is to stand in for an actor who is unable to achieve erection or ejaculation or an actor who has a penis of a relatively similar size, so that filming can continue on schedule.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "371446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371446", "title": "Tongan language", "text": "Tongan language\n\nTongan (\"\") is an Austronesian language of the Polynesian branch spoken in Tonga. It has around 180,000 speakers and is a national language of Tonga. It is a VSO (verb–subject–object) language.\n\nTongan is one of the multiple languages in the Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages, along with Hawaiian, Maori, Samoan and Tahitian, for example. Together with Niuean, it forms the Tongic subgroup of Polynesian.\n\nTongan is unusual among Polynesian languages in that it has a so-called \"definitive accent\". As with all Polynesian languages, Tongan has adapted the phonological system of proto-Polynesian.\n\n\nTongan is written in a subset of the Latin script. In the old, \"missionary\" alphabet, the order of the letters was modified: the vowels were put first and then followed by the consonants: a, e, i, o, u, etc. Thar was still so as of the Privy Council decision of 1943 on the orthography of the Tongan language. However, C. M. Churchward's grammar and dictionary favoured the standard European alphabetical order, which, since his time, has been in use exclusively:\nNotes:\n\nNote that the above order is strictly followed in proper dictionaries. Therefore, \"ngatu\" follows \"nusi\", \"a\" follows \"vunga\" and it also follows \"z\" if foreign words occur. Words with long vowels come directly after those with short vowels. Improper wordlists may or may not follow these rules. (For example, the Tonga telephone directory for years now ignores all rules.)\n\nThe original j, used for , disappeared in the beginning of the 20th century, merging with . By 1943, j was no longer used. Consequently, many words written with s in Tongan are cognate to those with t in other Polynesian languages. For example, \"Masisi\" (a star name) in Tongan is cognate with \"Matiti\" in Tokelauan; \"siale\" (Gardenia taitensis) in Tongan and \"tiare\" in Tahitian. This seems to be a natural development, as in many Polynesian languages derived from Proto-Polynesian .\n\n\nAlthough the acute accent has been available on most personal computers from their early days onwards, when Tongan newspapers started to use computers around 1990 to produce their papers, they were unable to find, or failed to enter, the proper keystrokes, and it grew into a habit to put the accent after the vowel instead of on it: not á but a´. But as this distance seemed to be too big, a demand arose for Tongan fonts where the acute accent was shifted to the right, a position halfway in between the two extremes above. Most papers still follow this practice.\n\nEnglish, like most European languages, uses only two articles:\n\nBy contrast, Tongan has three articles, and possessives also have a three-level definiteness distinction:\n\nThere are three registers which consist of\nThere are also further distinctions between \nFor example, the phrase \"Come and eat!\" translates to:\n\nThe Tongan language distinguishes 3 numbers: singular, dual, and plural. They appear as the 3 major columns in the tables below.\n\nThe Tongan language distinguishes 4 persons: First person exclusive, first person inclusive, second person and third person. They appear as the 4 major rows in the tables below. This gives us 12 main groups.\n\nIn addition, possessive pronouns are either alienable (reddish) or inalienable (greenish), which Churchward termed \"subjective\" and \"objective\". This marks a distinction that has been referred to, in some analyses of other Polynesian languages, as \"a-possession\" versus \"o-possession\", respectively, though more Tongan-appropriate version would be \"e-possession\" and \"ho-possession\".\n\n\"Subjective\" and \"objective\" are fitting labels when dealing with verbs: \"eku taki\" \"my leading\" vs. \"hoku taki\" \"my being led\". However, this is less apt when used on nouns. Indeed, in most contexts \"hoku taki\" would be interpreted as \"my leader\", as a noun rather than a verb. What then of nouns that have no real verb interpretation, such as \"fale\" \"house\"?\n\nChurchward himself laid out the distinction thus:\n\nBut what about those innumerable cases in which the possessive can hardly be said to correspond either to the subject or to the object of a verb? What, for example, is the rule or the guiding principle, which lies behind the fact that a Tongan says \"eku paanga\" for ' my money' but \"hoku fale\" for 'my house'?\n\nIt may be stated as follows: the use of \"eku\" for 'my' implies that I am active, influential, or formative, &c., towards the thing mentioned, whereas the use of \"hoku\" for 'my' implies that the thing mentioned is active, influential, or formative, &c., towards me. Or, provided that we give a sufficiently wide meaning to the word 'impress', we may say, perhaps, that \"eku\" is used in reference to things upon which I impress myself, while \"hoku\" is used in reference to things which impress themselves upon me.\n\nE possessives are generally used for:\n\n\nHo possessives are generally used for\n\n\nThere are plenty of exceptions which do not fall under the guidelines above, for instance, \"eku tamai\", \"my father\". The number of exceptions is large enough to make the alienable and inalienable distinction appear on the surface to be as arbitrary as the grammatical gender distinction for Romance languages, but by and large the above guidelines hold true.\n\nThe cardinal pronouns are the main personal pronouns which in Tongan can either be preposed (before the verb, light colour) or postposed (after the verb, dark colour). The first are the normal alienable possessive pronouns, the latter the stressed alienable pronouns, which are sometimes uses as reflexive pronouns, or with \"kia te\" in front the inalienable possessive forms. (There is no possession involved in the cardinal pronouns and therefore no alienable or inalienable forms).\nRemember:\nExamples of use.\n\nAnother archaic aspect of Tongan is the retention of preposed pronouns. They are used much less frequently in Sāmoan and have completely disappeared in East Polynesian languages, where the pronouns are cognate with the Tongan postposed form minus \"ki-\". (We love you: ʻOku ʻofa kimautolu kia te kimoutolu; Māori: e aroha nei mātou i a koutou).\n\nThe possessives for every person and number (1st person plural, 3rd person dual, etc.) can be further divided into normal or ordinary (light colour), emotional (medium colour) and emphatic (bright colour) forms. The latter is rarely used, but the two former are common and further subdivided in definite (saturated colour) and indefinite (greyish colour) forms.\nNotes:\n\nExamples of use.\n\nThese are the remainders: the pronominal adjectives (mine), indirect object pronouns or pronominal adverbs (for me) and the adverbial possessives (as me).\n\nNotes:\nExamples of use:\n\nFor 'simple' two-digit multiples of ten both the 'full-style' and 'telephone-style' numbers are in equally common use, while \nfor other two-digit numbers the 'telephone-style' numbers are almost exclusively in use:\n\nʻOku fiha ia? (how much (does it cost)?) Paʻanga ʻe ua-nima-noa (T$2.50)\n\nIn addition there are special, traditional counting systems for fish, coconuts, yams, etc.\n\nTongan is primarily a spoken, rather than written, language. The Bible and the Book of Mormon were translated into Tongan and few other books were written in it.\n\nThere are several weekly and monthly magazines in Tongan, but there are no daily newspapers.\n\nWeekly newspapers, some of them twice per week:\n\nMonthly or two-monthly papers, mostly church publications:\n\nThe Tongan calendar was based on the phases of the moon and had 13 months. The main purpose of the calendar, for Tongans, was to determine the time for the planting and cultivation of yams, which were Tonga's most important staple food. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1884416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1884416", "title": "Viewshed", "text": "Viewshed\n\nA viewshed is the geographical area that is visible from a location. It includes all surrounding points that are in line-of-sight with that location and excludes points that are beyond the horizon or obstructed by terrain and other features (e.g., buildings, trees). Conversely, it can also refer to area from which an object can be seen. A viewshed is not necessarily \"visible\" to humans; the same concept is used in radio communications to indicate where a specific combination of transmitter, antenna, and terrain allow reception of signal.\n\nViewsheds are commonly used in terrain analysis, which is of interest to urban planning, archaeology, and military science. In urban planning, for example, viewsheds tend to be calculated for areas of particular scenic or historic value that are deemed worthy of preservation against development or other change. Viewsheds are often calculated for public areas — for example, from public roadways, public parks, or high-rise buildings. The preservation of viewsheds is frequently a goal in the designation of open space areas, green belts, and community separators.\n\nA viewshed can be represented by raster data indicating the visibility of a viewpoint for or from an area of interest. In a binary representation, a cell (shown graphically as a pixel) with a value of 1 (or \"true\") indicates that the viewpoint is visible from that cell, while a value of 0 (false) indicates that the viewpoint is not visible. In certain disciplines, such as radio communications, \"visibility\" may be probabilistic and therefore the viewshed may be represented with non-integer values. Viewsheds for multiple points, lines, or areas may have counts or fractional values for queries involving \"how much\" or \"how many\" (e.g., how much of a highway is visible?).\n\nA terrain can be represented using a regular grid of points called Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Where each point of the DEM is represented by its coordinates X, Y and its height Z.\n\nViewshed calculation on a large DEM is costly from a computational point of view. This cost is much higher when calculating the viewshed for all the points of the DEM, also called total-viewshed. A faster algorithm for computing the total-viewshed of large DEMs was proposed on.\n\nClifford Tandy is credited with coining the term \"viewshed\" in 1967 by analogy to \"watershed\". The lexicographer Grant Barrett cites a use of the term from 1970 in the \"Oakland Tribune\".\n\nViewsheds are a specific type of visibility graph.\n\nIsovists are a closely related concept that is more common in the study of architecture. Viewsheds and isovists are sometimes said to be equivalent, however others have found differences between them. It has been argued that isovists are more focused on representing space whereas viewsheds are about the visibility of features. Also, the problems they are used in have different scales. Planners use viewsheds where terrain heights come into play whereas architects do not typically take that into account with isovists.\n\nThe area from which a structure can be seen may be called the \"Zone of Visual Influence.\" This can be referred to as the viewshed as well, though.\n\nTotal-viewshed map refers to the map, where each point represents the number of Km² visible at that point in the DEM.\n\nThe 3D-viewshed of a point (X,Y) of the DEM consists of the visible space from that point.\n\nA \"zone of visual influence\" is the area from which a development or other structure is theoretically visible. It is usually represented as a map using color to indicate visibility.\n\nZones of visual influence are used to identify the parts of a landscape that will be affected by a development. They are of particular use to landscape architects in determining visual intrusion as part of an environmental impact assessment. Zones of visual influence have been used extensively in wind farm development. A map will be created showing the number of wind turbines that are visible from a particular area. A cumulative zone of visual influence is used to define the cumulative effects of many developments.\n\nZones of visual influence are created using GIS tools.\n\n"}
