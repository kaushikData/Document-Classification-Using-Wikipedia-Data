Gamkrelidze and Russian linguist Vyacheslav Ivanov in 1985, suggests that Proto-Indo-European was spoken during the 5th–4th millennia BC in \"eastern Anatolia, the southern Caucasus, and northern Mesopotamia\".\n\nRecent DNA-research has led to renewed suggestions of a Caucasian homeland for a 'pre-proto-Indo-European'. It also lends support to the Indo-Hittite hypothesis, according to which both proto-Anatolian and proto-Indo-European split-off from a common mother language \"no later than the 4th millennium BCE.\"\n\nGamkrelidze and Ivanov presented their hypothesis in Russian in 1980–1981 in two articles in \"Vestnik drevnej istorii\". During the following years they expanded and developed their work into their voluminous book, published in Russian in 1984; the English translation of the book appeared in 1995. In English a short sketch of the hypothesis first appeared in \"The Early History of Indo-European Languages\", published in \"Scientific America\" in 1990. Tamas Gamkrelidze published an update to the hypothesis in 2010.\n\nAccording to Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, the Indo-European languages derive from a language originally spoken in the wide area of eastern Anatolia, the southern Caucasus, and northern Mesopotamia. The Anatolian languages, including Hittite, split-off before 4000 BCE, and migrated into Anatolia at around 2000 BCE. Around 4000 BCE, the proto-Indo-European community split into Greek-Armenian-Indo-Iranians, Celto-Italo-Tocharians, and Balto-Slavo-Germanics. At around 3000–2500 BCE, Greek moved to the west, while the Indo-Aryans, the Celto-Italo-Tocharians and the Balto-Slavo-Germanics moved east, and then northwards along the eastern slope of the Caspian Sea. The Tocharians split from the Italo-Celtics before 2000 BCE and moved further east, while the Italo-Celtics and the Balto-Slavo-Germanics turned west again towards the northern slopes of the Black Sea. From there, they expanded further into Europe between around 2000 and 1000 BCE.\n\nThe phonological peculiarities of the consonants proposed in the glottalic theory would be best preserved in Armenian and the Germanic languages. Proto-Greek would be practically equivalent to Mycenaean Greek from the 17th century BC and closely associate Greek migration to Greece with the Indo-Aryan migration to India at about the same time (the Indo-European expansion at the transition to the Late Bronze Age, including the possibility of Indo-European Kassites).\n\nThe hypothesis argues for the latest possible date of Proto-Indo-European (without Anatolian), roughly a millennium later than the mainstream Kurgan hypothesis. In this respect, it represents an opposite to the Anatolian hypothesis in spite of the geographical proximity of the respective suggested \"Urheimaten\" by diverging from the timeframe suggested there by approximately 3000 years.\n\nRobert Drews says that \"most of the chronological and historical arguments seem fragile at best, and of those that I am able to judge, some are evidently wrong\". However, he argues that it is far more powerful as a linguistic model, providing insights into the relationship between the Indo-European and the Semitic and Kartvelian languages.\n\nJ. Grepin wrote in a review in the \"Times Literary Supplement\" the model of linguistic relationships is \"the most complex, far reaching and fully supported of this century\".\n\nRecent DNA-research has led to renewed suggestions of a Caucasian homeland for a 'proto-proto-Indo-European'. It also lends support to the Indo-Hittite hypothesis, according to which both proto-Anatolian and proto-Indo-European split-off from a common mother language \"no later than the 4th millennium BCE.\"\n\nHaak et al. (2015) states that \"the Armenian plateau hypothesis gains in plausibility\" since the Yamnaya partly descended from a Near Eastern population, which resembles present-day Armenians. Yet, they also state that \"the question of what languages were spoken by the 'Eastern European hunter-gatherers' and the southern, Armenian-like, ancestral population remains open.\"\n\nDavid Reich, in his 2018 publication \"Who We Are and How We Got Here\", states that \"the most likely location of the population that first spoke an Indo-European language was south of the Caucasus Mountains, perhaps in present-day Iran or Armenia, because ancient DNA from people who lived there matches what we would expect for a source population both for the Yamnaya and for ancient Anatolians.\" Nevertheless, Reich also states that some, if not most, of the Indo-European languages were spread by the Yamnaya people.\n\nAccording to Kroonen et al. (2018), Damgaard et al. (2018) \"show no indication of a large-scale intrusion of a steppe population.\" They further note that the earliest attestation of Anatolian names, in the Armi state, must be dated to 3000-2400 BCE, contemporaneous with the Yamnaya culture, concluding that \"a scenario in which the Anatolian Indo-European language was linguistically derived from Indo-European speakers originating in this culture can be rejected.\" They further note that this lends support to the Indo-Hittite hypothesis, according to which both proto-Anatolian and proto-Indo-European split-off from a common mother language \"no later than the 4th millennium BCE.\"\n\nWang et al. (2018) note that the Caucasus served as a corridor for gene flow between the steppe and cultures south of the Caucasus during the Eneolithic and the Bronze Age, stating that this \"opens up the possibility of a homeland of PIE south of the Caucasus.\"\n\nKristian Kristiansen, in an interview with \"Der Spiegel\" in may 2018, stated that the Yamnaya culture may have had a predecessor at the Caucasus, where \"proto-proto-Indo-European\" was spoken.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8172431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8172431", "title": "Australia–Asia debating", "text": "Australia–Asia debating\n\nAustralia-Asia Debate, sometimes referred to as \"Australasian Debating\" or \"Australs Style\", is a form of academic debate. In the past few years, this style of debating has increased in usage dramatically throughout both Australia and the Asian region, but in the case of the Philippines, the format is also used alongside the British Parliamentary Format. The context in which the Australia-Asia style of debate is used varies, but it is commonly used in Australia at the primary and secondary school level, ranging from small informal one-off intra-school debates to larger more formal inter-school competitions with several rounds and a finals series which occur over a year. It is also commonly used at university level.\n\nAustralia-Asia style debates consist of two teams who debate over an issue, more commonly called a topic or proposition. The issue, by convention, is presented in the form of an affirmative statement beginning with \"That\", for example, \"That cats are better than dogs,\" or \"This House,\" for example \"This House would establish a world government.\" The subject of topics can vary from region to region.\n\nThe two teams in Australia–Asia debating are called the \"Affirmative\" or \"Proposition\" or \"Government\" and the \"Negative\" or \"Opposition\". The affirmative team agrees with the topic and presents arguments to demonstrate the truth of the topic. The negative team disagrees with the topic and presents arguments to disprove the truth of the topic. Each team must convince the adjudicator(s) (judge(s)) that their side of the topic is correct and that their opposition's is incorrect. Depending on the context in which a debate is being presented it may be appropriate for the audience to decide the winner of the debate. However, in formal debating the adjudicator is responsible for deciding the winner of the debate.\n\nEach team comprises three members, each of whom is named according to their team and speaking position within his or her team. For instance, the second speaker of the affirmative team to speak is called the \"second affirmative speaker\" (or \"second proposition speaker\"). Alternatively, the affirmative speakers may be referred to as \"Prime Minister\", \"Deputy Prime Minister\", and \"Government Whip\", while the negative speakers may be referred to as \"Opposition Leader\", \"Deputy Opposition Leader\", and \"Opposition Whip\". However, these names are not commonly used. Each of the six speakers (three affirmative and three negative) speak in succession, beginning with the first affirmative speaker. The speaking order is therefore as follows: first affirmative, first negative, second affirmative, second negative, third affirmative, and finally third negative.\n\nEach speaker has a set speaking time according to the rules agreed to by both teams. In formal debate contexts, such as school debating competitions in Australia, the speaking time is proportional to the school Year Level division that a team is competing in. For example, Year 6 debaters may have a speaking time of ~3 minutes, while Year 11 and 12 debaters may have a speaking time of ~8–10 minutes. There is no universally adopted speaking time.\n\nThe adjudicator will usually ring a bell one or two minutes before the speaker's time expires as a first warning (such as at 6 minutes in an eight-minute speech). A second warning is then given at the end of the allotted time, signalling that the debater ought to conclude as soon as possible (in many Australian schools, failure to conclude at this point will cause the speaker to lose points). Sometimes the second warning will be a double bell so as to distinguish between the first and second warnings. Some competition rules specify that a speaker must complete his or her speech within 30 seconds either side of the final bell, the warning bell acting only as a warning and not as an indicator that a speaker must stop speaking.\n\nShort interjections which can be questions, comments, or statements are called Points of Information. They are allowed between the first minute and the sixth minute of the speech, but the points of information are not allowed during the reply speech. When a team is delivering speech, the other team can do the point of information by standing up and exclaiming a short interjection. The speaker can decide to accept or reject it. If it is accepted, the point of information can be said. Otherwise, the person making the points of information must sit down.\n\nUnder some rules, a 'reply speech' will be able to be made by one of the speakers after all speakers have spoken. The negative team will usually be allowed to make their reply speech first. Often, only the first or second speaker of a team is allowed to make the reply speech. Points for the reply speeches are worth only half of points scored in the substantive speeches.\n\n1. Prime Minister\n2. Leader of Opposition\n3. Deputy Prime Minister\n4. Deputy Leader of Opposition\n5.Government Whip\n6. Opposition Whip\n7. Opposition Reply\n8. Government Reply\n\nFirst speakers should first give a brief introduction, contextualising the debate, and perhaps exploring the basic philosophical questions raised by the topic. Ordinarily, the first affirmative speaker would then explain the affirmative team's 'model', or 'mechanism'. It is not enough for a team simply to argue that we should implement some policy. The team must also explain to us how the policy is going to be implemented. That explanation is the 'model'. The first negative speaker can also use a 'model', often called a 'counter-model', but would only do so in particular circumstances. The first negative speaker should always make some points in rebuttal at this stage of the speech. However, such rebuttal should be kept short. \nThe first speaker, whether affirmative or negative, should then outline the 'team split', that is, what each of the team's speakers will be discussing. This is very important, as it helps to guide the adjudicator. The first speaker should then proceed to make substantive arguments in favour of his or her position.\n\nThe second speaker's role is both to refute the main arguments of the opposing first speaker, and to further advance his or her own team's case. New arguments ought to be introduced by the second speaker. The second speaker should spend about half of the speech rebutting the opposing team, and half advancing their own case.\n\nThe third speaker's role is to refute the opposing team's case, and to conclude and summarise his or her own team's case. The third speaker cannot make 'new' arguments in favour of his or her position. The goal of the third speaker should not be simply to pick out technical and practical flaws in the opposing team's case, but to undermine the deepest, most basic philosophical premises of the opposing team's argument. \n\nReply speakers should speak as if they are adjudicators passing judgment on the debate, although of course always looking favourably on their own side.\n\nIn formal debating contexts speakers are scored according to three categories: Matter, Manner and Method. Matter is the category that assesses the content of a speaker's speech which includes the arguments and evidence that they present to support his/her team's side of the topic. Manner is the category that assesses the way in which a speaker presents his/her material and usually includes factors such as eye contact, gesturing and voice projection. Method is category that assesses the way in which a speaker structures his/her speech and includes factors such as dynamics (the way that a speaker responds to their opposition's strategy) and rebuttal. The specific assessment criteria of Matter, Manner and Method depends on the rules under which the debate is conducted. The score ranges that are used to score Matter, Manner and Method, again vary. Generally speaking the entire speech is scored out of a total of 100 points, with 40 points allocated to Matter and Manner respectively and 20 points allocated to Method. To allow consistency in scoring some programs have adopted another system derived from the 100 point system. This other system reduces the range of scores. Both Matter and Manner are reduced from 40 points to 32 points, with a minimum score of 28 points respectively. Method is reduced from 20 points to 16 points, with a minimum of 14 points. Thus the score range is 70 points to 80 points with an average of 75 points. Since there are three speakers on each team the team's score can range from 210 points to 240 points with an average of 225 points. The team that is victorious in a debate has a higher team score than their opposition. On the rare occasion that a team is not prepared for a debate or unable to attend the other team is automatically given maximum points.\n\nIn the event that there are several rounds, teams generally are given a preparation time ranging from several weeks to half an hour. Debates where teams have less than a day to prepare are called Short Preparation or Impromptu debates. In these particular formats teams are usually restricted in the material that they have access to. In the event of restricted materials the speaking times may be shortened. Short Preparation debates are used in some programs as several debates are held on the same day, while others where rounds are held on different days over a longer period of time have Short Preparation debates in one or more of the rounds to complement the prepared debates. Some programs call the day on which several debating rounds are held \"Gala Day\".\n\nThere are a number of variations to the Australia–Asia style of debating. One variation is that there are four members on each team, the fourth member acting as an adviser to the other three. Another variation is that one of the three speakers in each team speaks an additional time after the Third Negative speaker. This is known as the Reply-Speaker format of debate. The order in which the additional speakers speak is dependent on the specific rules that the Affirmative and Negative Teams have agreed to debate under. Another variation used by The Australasian Intervarsity Debating Association is the Affirmative Action requirement, whereby the top three teams from each university must have at least three female members and one third of the entire contingent must be female.\n\nAnother variation used at university level debates is the 'secret topic' debate, where debate topics and sides are allocated only an hour before the debate. This format is primarily used at a university level, and is used by SAAUCC for intercollege debates. It is, however, also used in some high school-level debates, such as in the New South Wales Premier's Debating Challenge, the Sydney ISDA Competition (Independent School's Debating Association), the Western Australian Debating League senior debates, the Debating Association of Victoria, and the GPS debating association.\n\n\nDebate associations in Australia\nCollegiate websites\nDebate associations in New Zealand\n"}

The French language spoken in Belgium differs very little from that of France or Switzerland. It is characterized by the use of some terms that are considered archaic in France, as well as loanwords from languages such as Walloon, Picard and Dutch.\n\nFrench is one of the three official languages of Belgium alongside Dutch and German. It is spoken natively by around 39% of the population, primarily in the southern region of Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region.\n\nWhile a number of oïl languages have traditionally been spoken in different areas of Wallonia, French emerged as the regional language of literature in the 13th century. This was a result of heavy French cultural influence on the region over the past few centuries. The diversity of local languages influenced French in Wallonia, with words from Walloon, Picard, Champenois and Lorrain making their way into the local variant. Until the 20th century, Walloon was the majority language of Wallonia, and most speakers were bilingual in both French and Walloon.\n\nWhile the French spoken in Wallonia was influenced by local languages, the variant spoken in Brussels was influenced by Dutch, specifically the local Brabantian dialect. The city, geographically in the Flanders region, originally spoke only Dutch. However, a gradual Francisation began in the 19th century and intensified the end of the century and continued throughout 20th century. Today, many Dutch expressions have been translated into French and are used in the language in the Brussels area.\n\nThere are a few consistent phonological differences between the French in France and Belgium but usually no more than the differences between regional dialects within France (or the ones that exist between in the English of Toronto and Vancouver, for instance), which might even be nonexistent. Regional accents however, can vary from city to city (the Liège accent being an example). However, on the whole, accents may vary more according to one's social class and education.\n\nWhile stronger accents have been more typical of working-class people, they have become much less pronounced since World War I and the widespread use of television, which have helped to standardise accents and the types of words used by speakers. Francophones are taught the pronunciation of Standard French in schools. The following differences vary by speakers, according level of education, age and native region:\n\nCertain accents, such as in certain cities (notably Brussels and Liège) and those of speakers who are older and particularly less educated, are farther from the pronunciation of France. For example, in the dialect in and around Liège, particularly for older speakers, the letter \"h\" is pronounced in certain positions. It is always silent, however, in Standard French. That dialect is known also for its slow, slightly singing intonation, a trait that is even stronger toward the east, in the Verviers area.\n\nWords unique to Belgian French are called \"Belgicisms\" (French: \"belgicismes\"). Incidentally, that term is also used to refer to Dutch words used in Belgium but not in the Netherlands. In general, the francophone upper-middle class and educated speakers understand the meaning and use of words in Standard French, and they may also use Standard French if they speak with non-Belgians who speak in Standard French, as their accent hints. Overall, the lexical differences between Standard French and Belgian French are minor. They could be compared to the differences that might exist between two well-educated speakers of American English living in different parts of the United States or those between a well-educated Canadian English speaker and a well-educated British English speaker.\n\nFurthermore, the same speakers would often be well aware of the differences and might even be able to \"standardise\" their language or use each other's words to avoid confusion. Even so, there are too many forms to try to form any complete list in this article. However, some of the better-known usages include the following:\n\nBelgian French grammar is usually the same as that of Standard French, but Germanic influences can be seen in the following differences:\n\n\n"}

The theorem provides an unexpected link between the theory of formal languages and abstract algebra.\n\nIn order to state the theorem, a few notions from algebra and formal language theory are needed. \n\nLet formula_1 denote the set of nonnegative integers. A \"power series\" over formula_1 is an infinite series of the form\nwith coefficients formula_4 in formula_1. The \"multiplication\" of two formal power series formula_6 and formula_7 is defined in the expected way as the convolution of the sequences formula_8 and formula_9:\n\nIn particular, we write formula_11, formula_12, and so on. In analogy to algebraic numbers, a power series formula_13 is called \"algebraic\" over formula_14, if there exists a finite set of polynomials formula_15 each with rational coefficients such that\n\nA context-free grammar is said to be \"unambiguous\" if every string generated by the grammar admits a unique parse tree \nor, equivalently, only one leftmost derivation.\nHaving established the necessary notions, the theorem is stated as follows. \n\nProofs of this theorem are given by , and by .\n\nThe theorem can be used in analytic combinatorics to estimate the number of words of length \"n\" generated by a given unambiguous context-free grammar, as \"n\" grows large. The following example is given by : the unambiguous context-free grammar \"G\" over the alphabet {0,1} has start symbol \"S\" and the following rules\n\nTo obtain an algebraic representation of the power series associated with a given context-free grammar \"G\", one transforms the grammar into a system of equations. This is achieved by replacing each occurrence of a terminal symbol by \"x\", each occurrence of \"ε\" by the integer '1', each occurrence of '→' by '=', and each occurrence of '|' by '+', respectively. The operation of concatenation at the right-hand-side of each rule corresponds to the multiplication operation in the equations thus obtained. This yields the following system of equations:\n\nIn this system of equations, \"S\", \"M\", and \"U\" are functions of \"x\", so one could also write , , and . The equation system can be resolved after \"S\", resulting in a single algebraic equation:\n\nThis quadratic equation has two solutions for \"S\", one of which is the algebraic power series . By applying methods from complex analysis to this equation, the number formula_8 of words of length \"n\" generated by \"G\" can be estimated, as \"n\" grows large. In this case, one obtains\nformula_25 but formula_26 for each formula_27. See for a detailed exposition.\n\nIn classical formal language theory, the theorem can be used to prove that certain context-free languages are inherently ambiguous.\nFor example, the \"Goldstine language\" formula_28 over the alphabet formula_29 consists of the words\nformula_30\nwith formula_31, formula_32 for formula_33, and formula_34 for some formula_35.\n\nIt is comparably easy to show that the language formula_28 is context-free . The harder part is to show that there does not exist an unambiguous grammar that generates formula_28. This can be proved as follows:\nIf formula_38 denotes the number of words of length formula_19 in formula_28, then for the associated power series holds\nformula_41.\nUsing methods from complex analysis, one can prove that this function is not algebraic over formula_14. By the Chomsky-Schützenberger theorem, one can conclude that formula_28 does not admit an unambiguous context-free grammar. See for detailed account.\n"}

The comp thus serves as a draft of the final layout, and (if approved) is used as guide for further design changes and, ultimately, production.\n\nTraditionally, the four stages of an illustration or other commercial art creation (e.g., advertisement) are:\n\nFor traditional media (such as paint), the division between layout and comp is more clear-cut than for computer-generated art. For traditional media, the distinction between layout and comp is typically one of refinement and presentation. Layouts and comps are often done on different substrates because of this (e.g., tracing paper for a layout vs. calendered bond paper or illustration board for a comp). In this case, a layout done on tracing paper could be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) to see how it would eventually appear after finish render, and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp could be done on opaque bond paper or illustration board as a presentation piece for a client's approval.\n\nWith computer-generated art, the distinction between layout and comp has become blurred. Since computer-generated art can evolve as one file over time, finely segmented milestones in the development process have less meaning. With computer-generated art, even the sketch stage is often skipped. This has led to a two-stage process; comp and finish. The definitions of each milestone are roughly the same as with traditional media. Even in the age of rapid desktop publishing software, comps may be developed using hand-rendering techniques and materials to avoid investing too much time on the computer before client approval of the idea, depending on the complexity of the production task. If there is any three-dimensionality to the design (for example, the design is of a box or of a two sided piece) a \"physical comp\" is preferred to a computerized sketch because fundamental physical relationships (for example, position and show-through of die-cuts, or inadvertently designing Möbius strips) can be missed in a two-dimensional sketch. A hand-rendered comp may be useful in helping the client refrain from \"nitpicking\" the production quality and focus on the design idea.\n\nIn the overall creation process there is also a distinction between finish render and final render. Finish rendering refers to the process, and final rendering refers to the schedule. The first finish rendering may not be the final rendering; the first finish rendering could be the first of many renderings, with each subsequent finish rendering needing refinement before the final version is created.\n\nThe illustration element may incorporate stock photography, clip art, or other found material that gives an idea of what should be visually communicated, before entering any negotiations concerning the rights to use a specific image for the purpose. Picture agencies may encourage such use free of charge, in the hope that the comp image (sometimes referred to as a \"positional\" image) will end up being used in the final product. For this reason, it is sometimes mistakenly believed that \"comp\" is short for \"complimentary,\" as it is in some other promotional contexts.\n\nThe word \"comp\" can also be used as a verb. For example, an artist may \"comp something up\"; that is, they will create a comp. \"Comp\" may also stand for \"composition\" or \"composite layout\".\n\n"}

{"id": "312833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312833", "title": "Dots per inch", "text": "Dots per inch\n\nDots per inch (DPI, or dpi) is a measure of spatial printing or video or image scanner dot density, in particular the number of individual dots that can be placed in a line within the span of 1 inch (2.54 cm). Similarly, the more newly introduced dots per centimeter (d/cm or dpcm) refers to the number of individuel dots that can be placed within a line of 1 centimeter (≈ 0.393 in).\n\nMonitors do not have dots, but do have pixels; the closely related concept for monitors and images is pixels per inch or PPI. Many resources, including the Android developer guide, use the terms DPI and PPI interchangeably.\n\nDPI is used to describe the resolution number of dots per inch in a digital print and the printing resolution of a hard copy print dot gain, which is the increase in the size of the halftone dots during printing. This is caused by the spreading of ink on the surface of the media.\n\nUp to a point, printers with higher DPI produce clearer and more detailed output. A printer does not necessarily have a single DPI measurement; it is dependent on print mode, which is usually influenced by driver settings. The range of DPI supported by a printer is most dependent on the print head technology it uses. A dot matrix printer, for example, applies ink via tiny rods striking an ink ribbon, and has a relatively low resolution, typically in the range of . An inkjet printer sprays ink through tiny nozzles, and is typically capable of 300–720 DPI. A laser printer applies toner through a controlled electrostatic charge, and may be in the range of 600 to 2,400 DPI.\n\nThe DPI measurement of a printer often needs to be considerably higher than the pixels per inch (PPI) measurement of a video display in order to produce similar-quality output. This is due to the limited range of colors for each dot typically available on a printer. At each dot position, the simplest type of color printer can either print no dot, or print a dot consisting of a fixed volume of ink in each of four color channels (typically CMYK with cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink) or 2 = 16 colors on laser, wax and most inkjet printers, of which only 14 or 15 (or as few as 8 or 9) may be actually discernible depending on the strength of the black component, the strategy used for overlaying and combining it with the other colors, and whether it is in \"color\" mode.\n\nHigher-end inkjet printers can offer 5, 6 or 7 ink colors giving 32, 64 or 128 possible tones per dot location (and again, it can be that not all combinations will produce a unique result). Contrast this to a standard sRGB monitor where each pixel produces 256 intensities of light in each of three channels (RGB).\n\nWhile some color printers can produce variable drop volumes at each dot position, and may use additional ink-color channels, the number of colors is still typically less than on a monitor. Most printers must therefore produce additional colors through a halftone or dithering process, and rely on their base resolution being high enough to \"fool\" the human observer's eye into perceiving a patch of a single smooth color.\n\nThe exception to this rule is dye-sublimation printers, which can apply a much more variable amount of dye—close to or exceeding the number of the 256 levels per channel available on a typical monitor—to each \"pixel\" on the page without dithering, but with other limitations:\n\nThese disadvantages mean that, despite their marked superiority in producing good photographic and non-linear diagrammatic output, dye-sublimation printers remain niche products, and devices using higher resolution, lower color depth, and dither patterns remain the norm.\n\nThis dithered printing process could require a region of four to six dots (measured across each side) in order to faithfully reproduce the color in a single pixel. An image that is 100 pixels wide may need to be 400 to 600 dots in width in the printed output; if a 100×100-pixel image is to be printed in a one-inch square, the printer must be capable of 400 to 600 dots per inch to reproduce the image. Fittingly, 600 dpi (sometimes 720) is now the typical output resolution of entry-level laser printers and some utility inkjet printers, with 1200/1440 and 2400/2880 being common \"high\" resolutions. This contrasts with the 300/360 (or 240) dpi of early models, and the approximate 200 dpi of dot-matrix printers and fax machines, which gave faxed and computer-printed documents—especially those that made heavy use of graphics or colored block text—a characteristic \"digitized\" appearance, because of their coarse, obvious dither patterns, inaccurate colors, loss of clarity in photographs, and jagged (\"aliased\") edges on some text and line art.\n\nIn printing, DPI (dots per inch) refers to the output resolution of a printer or imagesetter, and PPI (pixels per inch) refers to the input resolution of a photograph or image.\n\"DPI\" refers to the physical dot density of an image when it is reproduced as a real physical entity, for example printed onto paper. A digitally stored image has no inherent physical dimensions, measured in inches or centimeters. Some digital file formats record a DPI value, or more commonly a PPI (pixels per inch) value, which is to be used when printing the image. This number lets the printer or software know the intended size of the image, or in the case of scanned images, the size of the original scanned object. For example, a bitmap image may measure 1,000 × 1,000 pixels, a resolution of 1 megapixel. If it is labeled as 250 PPI, that is an instruction to the printer to print it at a size of 4 × 4 inches. Changing the PPI to 100 in an image editing program would tell the printer to print it at a size of 10 × 10 inches. However, changing the PPI value would not change the size of the image in pixels which would still be 1,000 × 1,000. An image may also be resampled to change the number of pixels and therefore the size or resolution of the image, but this is quite different from simply setting a new PPI for the file.\n\nFor vector images, there is no equivalent of resampling an image when it is resized, and there is no PPI in the file because it is resolution independent (prints equally well at all sizes). However, there is still a target printing size. Some image formats, such as Photoshop format, can contain both bitmap and vector data in the same file. Adjusting the PPI in a Photoshop file will change the intended printing size of the bitmap portion of the data and also change the intended printing size of the vector data to match. This way the vector and bitmap data maintain a consistent size relationship when the target printing size is changed. Text stored as outline fonts in bitmap image formats is handled in the same way. Other formats, such as PDF, are primarily vector formats which can contain images, potentially at a mixture of resolutions. In these formats the target PPI of the bitmaps is adjusted to match when the target print size of the file is changed. This is the converse of how it works in a primarily bitmap format like Photoshop, but has exactly the same result of maintaining the relationship between the vector and bitmap portions of the data.\n\nSince the 1980s, the Microsoft Windows operating system has set the default display \"DPI\" to 96 PPI, while Apple/Macintosh computers have used a default of 72 PPI. These default specifications arose out of the problems rendering standard fonts in the early display systems of the 1980s, including the IBM-based CGA, EGA, VGA and 8514 displays as well as the Macintosh displays featured in the 128K computer and its successors. The choice of 72 PPI by Macintosh for their displays arose from the convenient fact that the official 72 \"points per inch\" mirrored the 72 \"pixels per inch\" that appeared on their display screens. (Points are a physical unit of measure in typography, dating from the days of printing presses, where 1 point by the modern definition is 1/72 of the international inch (25.4 mm), which therefore makes 1 point approximately 0.0139 in or 352.8 µm). Thus, the 72 pixels per inch seen on the display had exactly the same physical dimensions as the 72 points per inch later seen on a printout, with 1 pt in printed text equal to 1 px on the display screen. As it is, the Macintosh 128K featured a screen measuring 512 pixels in width by 342 pixels in height, and this corresponded to the width of standard office paper (512 px ÷ 72 px/in ≈ 7.1 in, with a 0.7 in margin down each side when assuming 8.5 in × 11 in North American paper size (in Europe, it's 21cm x 30cm - called \"A4\". B5 is 176 millimeters x 250 millimeters)).\n\nA consequence of Apple's decision was that the widely used 10-point fonts from the typewriter era had to be allotted 10 display pixels in em height, and 5 display pixels in \"x-height\". This is technically described as 10 \"pixels per em\" (\"PPEm\"). This made 10-point fonts be rendered crudely and made them difficult to read on the display screen, particularly the lowercase characters. Furthermore, there was the consideration that computer screens are typically viewed (at a desk) at a distance 30% greater than printed materials, causing a mismatch between the perceived sizes seen on the computer screen and those on the printouts.\n\nMicrosoft tried to solve both problems with a hack that has had long-term consequences for the understanding of what DPI and PPI mean. Microsoft began writing its software to treat the screen as though it provided a PPI characteristic that is formula_1 of what the screen actually displayed. Because most screens at the time provided around 72 PPI, Microsoft essentially wrote its software to assume that every screen provides 96 PPI (because formula_2). The short-term gain of this trickery was twofold:\n\nThus, for example, a 10-point font on a Macintosh (at 72 PPI) was represented with 10 pixels (i.e., 10 PPEm), whereas a 10-point font on a Windows platform (at 96 PPI) at the same zoom level is represented with 13 pixels (i.e., Microsoft rounded 13.3333 to 13 pixels, or 13 PPEm) – and, on a typical consumer grade monitor, would have physically appeared around 15/72 to 16/72 of an inch high instead of 10/72. Likewise, a 12-point font was represented with 12 pixels on a Macintosh, and 16 pixels (or a physical display height of maybe 19/72 of an inch) on a Windows platform at the same zoom, and so on. The negative consequence of this standard is that with 96 PPI displays, there is no longer a 1-to-1 relationship between the font size in pixels and the printout size in points. This difference is accentuated on more recent displays that feature higher pixel densities. This has been less of a problem with the advent of vector graphics and fonts being used in place of bitmap graphics and fonts. Moreover, many Windows software programs have been written since the 1980s which assume that the screen provides 96 PPI. Accordingly, these programs do not display properly at common alternative resolutions such as 72 PPI or 120 PPI. The solution has been to introduce two concepts:\nSoftware programs render images to the virtual screen and then the operating system renders the virtual screen onto the physical screen. With a logical PPI of 96 PPI, older programs can still run properly regardless of the actual physical PPI of the display screen, although they may exhibit some visual distortion thanks to the effective 133.3% pixel zoom level (requiring either that every third pixel be doubled in width/height, or heavy-handed smoothing be employed).\n\nDisplays with high pixel densities were not common up to the Windows XP era. High DPI displays became mainstream around the time Windows 8 was released. Display scaling by entering a custom DPI irrespective of the display resolution has been a feature of Microsoft Windows since Windows 95. Windows XP introduced the GDI+ library which allows resolution-independent text scaling.\n\nWindows Vista introduced support for programs to declare themselves to the OS that they are high-DPI aware via a manifest file or using an API. For programs that do not declare themselves as DPI-aware, Windows Vista supports a compatibility feature called DPI virtualization so system metrics and UI elements are presented to applications as if they are running at 96 DPI and the Desktop Window Manager then scales the resulting application window to match the DPI setting. Windows Vista retains the Windows XP style scaling option which when enabled turns off DPI virtualization for all applications globally. DPI virtualization is a compatibility option as application developers are all expected to update their apps to support high DPI without relying on DPI virtualization.\n\nWindows Vista also introduces Windows Presentation Foundation. WPF .NET applications are vector-based, not pixel-based and are designed to be resolution-independent. Developers using the old GDI API and Windows Forms on .NET Framework runtime need to update their apps to be DPI aware and flag their applications as DPI-aware.\n\nWindows 7 adds the ability to change the DPI by doing only a log off, not a full reboot and makes it a per-user setting. Additionally, Windows 7 reads the monitor DPI from the EDID and automatically sets the system DPI value to match the monitor's physical pixel density, unless the effective resolution is less than 1024 x 768.\n\nIn Windows 8, only the DPI scaling percentage is shown in the DPI changing dialog and the display of the raw DPI value has been removed. In Windows 8.1, the global setting to disable DPI virtualization (only use XP-style scaling) is removed and a per-app setting added for the user to disable DPI virtualization from the Compatibility tab. When the DPI scaling setting is set to be higher than 120 PPI (125%), DPI virtualization is enabled for all applications unless the application opts out of it by specifying a DPI aware flag (manifest) as \"true\" inside the EXE. Windows 8.1 retains a per-application option to disable DPI virtualization of an app. Windows 8.1 also adds the ability for different displays to use independent DPI scaling factors, although it calculates this automatically for each display and turns on DPI virtualization for all monitors at any scaling level.\n\nWindows 10 adds manual control over DPI scaling for individual monitors.\n\nThere are some ongoing efforts to abandon the DPI Image resolution unit in favor of a metric unit, giving the inter-dot spacing in dots per centimeter ( px/cm or dpcm), as used in CSS3 media queries or micrometres (µm) between dots. A resolution of 72 DPI, for example, equals a resolution of about 28 dpcm or an inter-dot spacing of about 350 µm. In BMP images 2835 pixels per meter correspond to 72 DPI (rounded from 2834.6472).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "513844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=513844", "title": "Emoji", "text": "Emoji\n\nOriginating on Japanese mobile phones in 1999, emoji became increasingly popular worldwide in the 2010s after being added to several mobile operating systems. They are now considered to be a large part of popular culture in the west. In 2015, Oxford Dictionaries named the Face with Tears of Joy emoji the Word of the Year.\n\nThe development of emoji was predated by text-based emoticons, as well as graphical representations, inside and outside of Japan.\n\nThe first emoji was created in 1999 in Japan by Shigetaka Kurita. He was part of the team working on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode mobile Internet platform. Kurita took inspiration from weather forecasts that used symbols to show weather, Chinese characters and street signs, and from manga that used stock symbols to express emotions, such as lightbulbs signifying inspiration. Emoji were initially used (see Japanese mobile phone culture) by the Japanese mobile operators NTT DoCoMo, au, and SoftBank Mobile (formerly Vodafone). These companies each defined their own variants of emoji using proprietary standards. The first set of 176 12×12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services. Kurita created the first 180 emoji based on the expressions that he observed people making and other things in the city.\n\nFor NTT DoCoMo's i-mode, each emoji is drawn on a 12×12 pixel grid. When transmitted, emoji symbols are specified as a two-byte sequence, in the private-use range E63E through E757 in the Unicode character space, or F89F through F9FC for Shift JIS. The basic specification has 1706 symbols, with 76 more added in phones that support C-HTML 4.0.\n\nEmoji pictograms by Japanese mobile phone brand Au are specified using the IMG tag. SoftBank Mobile emoji are wrapped between SI/SO escape sequences, and support colors and animation. DoCoMo's emoji are the most compact to transmit while Au's version is more flexible and based on open standards.\n\nFrom 2010 onwards, some emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, a standard system for indexing characters, which has allowed them to be used outside Japan and to be standardized across different operating systems.\n\nHundreds of emoji characters were encoded in the Unicode Standard in version 6.0 released in October 2010 (and in the related international standard ISO/IEC 10646). The additions, originally requested by Google (Kat Momoi, Mark Davis, and Markus Scherer wrote the first draft for consideration by the Unicode Technical Committee in August 2007) and Apple Inc. (whose Yasuo Kida and Peter Edberg joined the first official UTC proposal for 607 characters as coauthors in January 2009), went through a long series of commenting by members of the Unicode Consortium and national standardization bodies of various countries participating in ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2, especially the United States, Germany, Ireland (led by Michael Everson), and Japan; various new characters (especially symbols for maps and European signs) were added during the consensus-building process. Encoding in the Unicode standard has allowed emoji to become popular outside Japan. The core emoji set in Unicode 6.0 consisted of 722 characters, of which 114 characters map to sequences of one or more characters in the pre-6.0 Unicode standard, and the remaining 608 characters map to sequences of one or more characters introduced in Unicode 6.0. There is no block specifically set aside for emoji – the new symbols were encoded in seven different blocks (some newly created), and there exists a Unicode data file called EmojiSources.txt that includes mappings to and from the Japanese vendors' legacy character sets. \"Regional Indicator Symbols\" were defined as part of this set of characters as an alternative to encoding separate characters for national flags.\n\nThe popularity of emoji has caused pressure from vendors and international markets to add additional designs into the Unicode standard to meet the demands of different cultures. Unicode 7.0 added approximately 250 emoji, many from the Webdings and Wingdings fonts. Some characters now defined as emoji are inherited from a variety of pre-Unicode messenger systems not only used in Japan, including Yahoo and MSN Messenger. Unicode 8.0 added another 41 emoji, including articles of sports equipment such as the cricket bat, food items such as the taco, signs of the Zodiac, new facial expressions, and symbols for places of worship. Corporate demand for emoji standardisation has placed pressures on the Unicode Consortium, with some members complaining that it had overtaken the group's traditional focus on standardising characters used for minority languages and transcribing historical records.\n\nEmoji characters vary slightly between platforms within the limits in meaning defined by the Unicode specification, as companies have tried to provide artistic presentations of ideas and objects. For example, following an Apple tradition, the calendar emoji on Apple products always shows July 17, the date in 2002 Apple announced its iCal calendar application for macOS. This led some Apple product users to initially nickname July 17 \"World Emoji Day\". Other emoji fonts show different dates or do not show a specific one.\n\nSome Apple emoji are very similar to the SoftBank standard, since SoftBank was the first Japanese network the iPhone launched on. For example, is female on Apple and SoftBank standards but male or gender-neutral on others.\n\nJournalists have noted that the ambiguity of emoji has allowed them to take on culture-specific meanings not present in the original glyphs. For example, has been described as being used in English-language communities to signify \"non-caring fabulousness\" and \"anything from shutting haters down to a sense of accomplishment\". Unicode manuals sometimes provide notes on auxiliary meanings of an object to guide designers on how emoji may be used, for example noting that some users may expect to stand for \"a reserved or ticketed seat, as for an airplane, train, or theater\".\n\nOxford Dictionaries named its 2015 Word of the Year. Oxford noted that 2015 had seen a sizable increase in the use of the word \"emoji\" and recognized its impact on popular culture. Oxford Dictionaries President Caspar Grathwohl expressed that \"traditional alphabet scripts have been struggling to meet the rapid-fire, visually focused demands of 21st Century communication. It's not surprising that a pictographic script like emoji has stepped in to fill those gaps—it's flexible, immediate, and infuses tone beautifully.\" SwiftKey found that \"Face with Tears of Joy\" was the most popular emoji across the world. The American Dialect Society declared to be the \"Most Notable Emoji\" of 2015 in their Word of the Year vote.\n\nSome emoji are specific to Japanese culture, such as a bowing businessman (), the shoshinsha mark used to indicate a beginner driver (), a white flower () used to denote \"brilliant homework\", or a group of emoji representing popular foods: ramen noodles (), dango (), onigiri (), Japanese curry (), and sushi (). Unicode Consortium founder Mark Davis compared the use of emoji to a developing language, particularly mentioning the American use of eggplant () to represent a phallus. Some linguists have classified emoji and emoticons as discourse markers.\n\nIn December 2015 a sentiment analysis of emoji was published, and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking 1.0 was provided. In 2015, it was announced that Sony Pictures Animation was planning on making a feature animated film based on emoji, which was released in summer 2017. In 2016, a musical about emoji premiered in Los Angeles.\n\nIn January 2017, in what is believed to be the first large-scale study of emoji usage, researchers at the University of Michigan analysed over 1.2 billion messages input via the Kika Emoji Keyboard and announced that the Face With Tears of Joy was the most popular emoji. The Heart and the Heart eyes emoji stood second and third respectively. The study also found that the French heart emoji the most. People in countries like Australia, France and the Czech Republic used more happy emoji, while this was not so for people in Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Argentina, where people used more negative emoji in comparison to cultural hubs known for restraint and self-discipline, like Turkey, France and Russia.\n\nThere has been discussion among legal experts on whether or not emoji could be admissible as evidence in court trials. Furthermore, as emoji continue to develop and grow as a \"language\" of symbols, there may also be the potential of the formation of emoji \"dialects\". Emoji are being used as more than just to show reactions and emotions. Snapchat have even incorporated emoji in their trophy and friends system with each emoji showing a complex meaning.\n\nResearch has shown that emoji are often misunderstood. In some cases, this misunderstanding is related to how the actual emoji design is interpreted by the viewer; in other cases, the emoji that was sent is not shown in the same way on the receiving side.\n\nThe first issue relates to the cultural or contextual interpretation of the emoji. When the author picks an emoji, they think about it in a certain way, but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver. (See also Models of communication.)\n\nFor example, people in China have developed a system for using emoji subversively, so that a smiley face could be sent to convey a despising, mocking, and even obnoxious attitude, as the orbicularis oculi (the muscle near that upper eye corner) on the face of the emoji does not move, and the orbicularis oris (the one near the mouth) tightens, which is believed to be a sign of suppressing a smile.\n\nThe second problem relates to technology and branding. When an author of a message picks an emoji from a list, it is normally encoded in a non-graphical manner during the transmission, and if the author and the reader do not use the same software or operating system for their devices, the reader's device may visualize the same emoji in a different way. Small changes to a character's look may completely alter its perceived meaning with the receiver.\n\nSome emoji have been involved in controversy due to their perceived meanings. Multiple arrests and imprisonments have followed usage of gun (), knife (), and bomb () emoji in ways that were deemed by authorities to constitute credible threats.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2016 Summer Olympics, the Unicode Consortium considered proposals to add several Olympic-related emoji, including medals and events such as handball and water polo. By October 2015, these candidate emoji included \"rifle\" () and \"modern pentathlon\" (). However, in 2016, Apple and Microsoft opposed these two emoji, and the characters were added without emoji presentations, meaning that software is expected to render them in black-and-white rather than color, and emoji-specific software such as onscreen keyboards will generally not include them. In addition, while the original incarnations of the modern pentathlon emoji depicted its five events, including a man pointing a gun, the final glyph contains a person riding a horse, along with a laser pistol target in the corner.\n\nOn August 1, 2016, Apple announced that in iOS 10, the gun emoji () would be changed from a realistic revolver to a water pistol. Conversely, the following day, Microsoft pushed out an update to Windows 10 that changed its longstanding depiction of the gun emoji as a toy ray-gun to a real revolver. Microsoft stated that the change was made to bring the glyph more in line with industry-standard designs and customer expectations. By 2018, most major platforms such as Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Facebook, and Twitter had transitioned their rendering of the pistol emoji to match Apple's water gun implementation.\n\nThe eggplant () emoji () has also seen controversy due to its being used, almost solely in the United States, to represent a penis. Beginning in December 2014, the hashtag began to rise to popularity on Instagram for use in marking photos featuring clothed or unclothed penises. This became such a popular trend that beginning in April 2015, Instagram disabled the ability to search for not only the tag, but also other eggplant-containing hashtags, including simply and .\n\nThe peach emoji () has likewise been used as a euphemistic icon for buttocks, with a 2016 Emojipedia analysis revealing that only 7% of English language tweets with the peach emoji refer to the actual fruit. In 2016, Apple attempted to redesign the emoji to less resemble a butt. This was met with fierce backlash in beta testing and Apple reversed its decision by the time it went live to the public.\n\nIn December 2017 a lawyer in Delhi, India threatened to file suit against WhatsApp for allowing use of the middle finger emoji () on the basis that the company is \"directly abetting the use of an offensive, lewd, obscene gesture\" in violation of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nUnicode defines variation sequences for many of its emoji to indicate their desired presentation.\nSpecifying the desired presentation is done by following the base emoji with either U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (VS15) for text or U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (VS16) for emoji-style.\n\nFive symbol modifier characters were added with Unicode 8.0 to provide a range of skin tones for human emoji. These modifiers are called EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-1-2, −3, −4, −5, and −6 (U+1F3FB–U+1F3FF): 🏻 🏼 🏽 🏾 🏿. They are based on the Fitzpatrick scale for classifying human skin color. Human emoji that are not followed by one of these five modifiers should be displayed in a generic, non-realistic skin tone, such as bright yellow (■), blue (■), or gray (■). Non-human emoji (like ) are unaffected by the Fitzpatrick modifiers.\nAs of Unicode 11.0, Fitzpatrick modifiers can be used with 106 human emoji spread across six blocks: Dingbats, Emoticons, Miscellaneous Symbols, Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs, Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs, and Transport and Map Symbols.\n\nThe following table shows both the Unicode characters and the open-source \"Twemoji\" images, designed by Twitter:\n\nImplementations may use U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER (ZWJ) between emoji to make them behave like a single, unique emoji character.\n\nFor example, the sequence U+1F468 MAN, U+200D ZWJ, U+1F469 WOMAN, U+200D ZWJ, U+1F467 GIRL (👨‍👩‍👧) could be displayed as a single emoji depicting a family with a man, a woman, and a girl if the implementation supports it. Systems that don't support it would ignore the ZWJs, showing the base emoji in the sequence: U+1F468 MAN, U+1F469 WOMAN, U+1F467 GIRL (👨👩👧).\n\nUnicode previously maintained a catalog of emoji ZWJ sequences that are supported on at least one commonly available platform. The consortium has since switched to only document sequences that are \"recommended for general interchange\" (RGI).\n\nUnicode 11.0 represents emoji using 1,250 characters spread across 22 blocks, of which 26 are Regional Indicator Symbols that combine in pairs to form flag emoji, and 12 (#, * and 0–9) are base characters for keycap emoji sequences:\n\n637 of the 768 code points in the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs block are considered emoji. 199 of the 213 code points in the Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs block are considered emoji. All of the 80 code points in the Emoticons block are considered emoji. 95 of the 108 code points in the Transport and Map Symbols block are considered emoji. 82 of the 256 code points in the Miscellaneous Symbols block are considered emoji. 33 of the 192 code points in the Dingbats block are considered emoji.\n\nAdditional emoji can be found in the following Unicode blocks: Arrows (8 code points considered emoji), Basic Latin (12), CJK Symbols and Punctuation (2), Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement (41), Enclosed Alphanumerics (1), Enclosed CJK Letters and Months (2), Enclosed Ideographic Supplement (15), General Punctuation (2), Geometric Shapes (8), Latin-1 Supplement (2), Letterlike Symbols (2), Mahjong Tiles (1), Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows (7), Miscellaneous Technical (18), Playing Cards (1), and Supplemental Arrows-B (2).\n\nSome vendors, most notably Microsoft, Samsung and HTC, add emoji presentation to some other existing Unicode characters or coin their own ZWJ sequences.\n\nMicrosoft displays all Mahjong tiles (U+1F000‥2B, not just ) and alternative card suits (, , , ) as emoji. They also support additional pencils (, ) and a heart-shaped bullet ().\n\nWhile only is officially an emoji, Microsoft and Samsung add the other three directions as well (, , ).\nBoth vendors pair the standard checked ballot box emoji with its crossed variant , but only Samsung also has the empty ballot box .\n\nSamsung almost completely covers the rest of the Miscellaneous Symbols block (U+2600‥FF) as emoji, which includes Chess pieces, game die faces, some traffic sign as well as genealogical and astronomical symbols for instance.\n\nHTC supports most additional pictographs from the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs (U+1F300‥5FF) and Transport and Map Symbols (U+1F680‥FF) blocks. Some of them are also shown as emoji on Samsung devices.\n\nThe open source projects Emojidex and Emojitwo are trying to cover all of these extensions established by major vendors.\n\nThe exact appearance of emoji is not prescribed but varies between fonts, in the same way that normal typefaces can display letters differently. For example, the Apple Color Emoji typeface is proprietary to Apple, and can only be used on Apple devices (without additional hacking). Different computing companies have developed their own fonts to display emoji, some of which have been open-sourced to permit their reuse. Both colour and monochrome emoji typefaces exist, as well as at least one animated design.\n\nAndroid devices support emoji differently depending on the operating system version. Google added native emoji support to Android in July 2013 with Android 4.3, and to the Google Keyboard in November 2013 for devices running Android 4.4 and later. Android 7.0 Nougat added Unicode 9 emoji, skin tone modifiers, and a redesign of many existing emoji.\n\nEmoji are also supported by the Google Hangouts application (independent of the keyboard in use), in both Hangouts and SMS modes. Several third-party messaging and keyboard applications (such as IQQI Keyboard) for Android devices provide plugins that allow the use of emoji. Some apps, e.g. WhatsApp, come with Apple emoji for internal use. With Android 8 (Oreo), Google added a compatibility library that, if included by app developers, makes the latest Noto emoji available on any platform since Android 4.3.\n\nUntil 2016, mobile phone vendors HTC and LG deployed variants of NotoColorEmoji.ttf with custom glyphs; Samsung still does. Some Japanese mobile carriers used to equip branded Android devices with emoji glyphs that were closer to the original ones, but apparently have stopped updating these circa 2015.\n\nApple first introduced emoji to their desktop operating system with the release of OS X 10.7 Lion, in 2011. Users can view emoji characters sent through email and messaging applications, which are commonly shared by mobile users, as well as any other application. Users can create emoji symbols using the \"Characters\" special input panel from almost any native application by selecting the \"Edit\" menu and pulling down to \"Special Characters\", or by the key combination . The desktop OS uses the Apple Color Emoji font that was introduced earlier in iOS. This provides users with full color pictographs.\n\nThe emoji keyboard was first available in Japan with the release of iPhone OS version 2.2 in 2008. The emoji keyboard was not officially made available outside of Japan until iOS version 5.0. From iPhone OS 2.2 through to iOS 4.3.5 (2011), those outside Japan could access the keyboard but had to use a third party app to enable it. The first of such apps was developed by Josh Gare; emoji beginning to be embraced by popular culture outside Japan has been attributed to these apps. iOS was updated to support Fitzpatrick skin-tone modifiers with version 8.3.\n\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks introduced a dedicated emoji input palette in most text input boxes using the key combination .\n\nOn September 12, 2017, Apple announced that the Messages app on the iPhone X would get \"Animoji\", which are versions of standard emoji that are custom-animated with the use of facial motion capture to reflect the sender's expressions. These Animoji can also utilize lip sync to appear to speak audio messages recorded by the sender. Apple had created 3D models of all standard emoji prior to its late-2016 OS updates from which the static default 2D graphics had been rendered. A select set of these models are being reused for creating still images and short animations dynamically.\n\nApple has revealed that the \"face with tears of joy\" is the most popular emoji among English speaking Americans. On second place is the \"heart\" emoji followed by the \"Loudly Crying Face\".\n\nOn July 17, 2018, for the World Emoji Day, Apple announced that it will be adding 70 more emoji in its 2018 iOS update, including the long-awaited, red hair, white hair, curly hair and bald emoji.\n\nChrome OS, through its inclusion of the Noto fonts, supports the emoji set introduced through Unicode 6.2. As of Chrome OS 41, Noto Color Emoji is the default font for most emoji.\n\nUbuntu 18.04 and Fedora 28 support color emoji by default, using Noto Color Emoji. Some Linux distributions require the installation of extra fonts. Color emoji are supported by FreeType and Cairo.\n\nAn update for the Segoe UI Symbol font in Windows 7 and in Windows Server 2008 R2 brought a subset of the monochrome Unicode set to those operating systems. The font update rebranded the font as \"Segoe UI Symbol\". The difference between the two fonts is that Segoe UI lacks any and all emoji characters, while Segoe UI Symbol and Segoe UI Emoji include them. Windows 8 and higher supports the full Unicode emoji characters through Microsoft's Segoe UI family of fonts. Emoji characters are accessed through the onscreen keyboard's \"smiley\" key. As of Windows 8.1 Preview, Segoe UI Emoji font supplies full-color pictographs. Differently from macOS and iOS, color glyphs are only supplied when the application supports Microsoft's DirectWrite API, and Segoe UI Emoji is explicitly declared, otherwise monochrome glyphs appear. Segoe UI Emoji and its full-color emoji set is not fully supported by all programs written for Windows; for example, among Web browsers, Internet Explorer and Google Chrome can use the font, but Firefox initially did not (that browser now supports full color emoji and includes the EmojiOne set in installation). Windows 10 Anniversary Update added Unicode 9 emoji.\n\nA limited number of top-level domains allow registration of domain names containing emoji characters. Emoji-containing subdomains are also possible under any top-level domain.\n\nFacebook and Twitter replace all Unicode emoji used on their websites with their own custom graphics.\n\nFacebook has different sets for the main site and for its Messenger service, where only the former provides complete coverage. Facebook reactions are only partially compatible with standard emoji.\n\nTwitter has released Twemoji, which is their emoji graphics together with a Javascript library to handle them, under the Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license and the MIT open-source license, respectively. Their apps use emoji native to the platform they are running on.\n\nAny operating system that supports adding additional fonts to the system can add an emoji-supporting font.\n\nEmojiOne version 2.3, an open-source font available under free license, supports the full emoji set in color through Unicode Emoji 3.0, i.e. Unicode 9.0. EmojiOne version 3.1, with a stricter license that disallows the redistribution of vector images, supports Unicode Emoji 5.0, hence characters added in Unicode 10.0. EmojiTwo, an open-source fork of EmojiOne 2.3, aims to add all emoji from 2017 and later.\n\nNote, however, that not all operating systems have support for color fonts, so in these cases emoji might have to be rendered as black-and-white line art or not at all. OpenType version 1.8 standardizes four different formats for color fonts: one built upon standard glyphs and backed by Microsoft; one built upon SVG and backed by Mozilla, Adobe, and others; one based upon PNG chunks and backed by Google; and one supporting a variety of embedded image formats, but preferably PNG, backed by Apple. This means that color fonts need to come in several formats to be usable on multiple operating systems.\n\nThe font \"Symbola\" contains all emoji through version 10.0 as normal monochrome glyphs. Through version 10, Symbola was a public domain font; beginning with version 11 in 2018, Symbola has been copyrighted with a ban on commercial use and derivative works. Other typefaces including a significant number of emoji characters include Noto Emoji, Adobe Source Emoji, and Quivira.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1887608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887608", "title": "Esperantido", "text": "Esperantido\n\nAn Esperantido is a constructed language derived from Esperanto. \"Esperantido\" originally referred to the language which is now known as Ido. The word \"Esperantido\" is derived from \"Esperanto\" plus the affix \"-id-\" (\"-ido\"), which means a \"child (\"born to a parent\"), young (\"of an animal\") or offspring\" (\"ido\"). Hence, \"Esperantido\" literally means an \"offspring or descendant of Esperanto\".\n\nA number of Esperantidos have been created to address a number of perceived flaws or weaknesses in Esperanto, or in other Esperantidos, attempting to improve their lexicon, grammar, pronunciation, and orthography. Others were created as language games or to add variety to Esperanto literature.\n\nThese attempted improvements were intended to replace Esperanto. Limited suggestions for improvement within the framework of Esperanto, such as orthographic reforms and riism, are not considered Esperantidos.\n\n\"Mundolinco\" (1888) was the first Esperantido, created in 1888. Changes from Esperanto include combining the adjective and adverb under the suffix \"-e\", loss of the accusative and adjectival agreement, changes to the verb conjugations, eliminating the diacritics, and bringing the vocabulary closer to Latin, for example with superlative \"-osim-\" to replace the Esperanto particle \"plej\" \"most\".\n\nZamenhof himself proposed several changes in the language in 1894, which were rejected by the Esperanto community and subsequently abandoned by Zamenhof himself.\n\nIdo (1907), the foremost of the Esperantidos, sought to bring Esperanto into closer alignment with Western European expectations of an ideal language, based on familiarity with French, English, and Italian. Reforms included changing the spelling by removing non-Roman letters such as \"ĉ\" and re-introducing the k/q dichotomy; removing a couple of the more obscure phonemic contrasts (one of which, , has been effectively removed from standard Esperanto); ending the infinitives in \"-r\" and the plurals in \"-i\" like Italian; eliminating adjectival agreement, and removing the need for the accusative case by setting up a fixed default word order; reducing the amount of inherent gender in the vocabulary, providing a masculine suffix and an epicene third-person singular pronoun; replacing the pronouns and correlatives with forms more similar to the Romance languages; adding new roots where Esperanto uses the antonymic prefix \"mal-\"; replacing much of Esperanto's other regular derivation with separate roots, which are thought to be easier for Westerners to remember; and replacing much of the Germanic and Slavic vocabulary with Romance forms, such as \"navo\" for English-derived \"ŝipo\". See the Ido \"Pater noster\" below.\n\nIdo spawned its own idos, the first being Adjuvilo (1908), which was created by an Esperantist to sow dissent in the Ido community.\n\nRené de Saussure (brother of linguist Ferdinand de Saussure) published numerous Esperantido proposals, starting with a response to Ido later called \"Antido 1\" (\"Anti-Ido 1\") in 1907, which increasingly diverged from Esperanto before finishing with a more conservative Esperanto II in 1937. Esperanto II replaced \"j\" with \"y\", \"kv\" with \"q\", \"kz\" with \"x\", and diacritic letters with \"j\" (\"ĵ\" and \"ĝ\"), \"w\" (\"ŭ\"), and digraphs \"sh\" (\"ŝ\"), \"ch\" (\"ĉ\"); replaced the passive in \"-iĝ-\" with \"-ev-\", the indefinite ending \"-aŭ\" with adverbial \"-e\", the accusative \"-on\" on nouns with \"-u\", and the plural on nouns with \"-n\" (so \"membrun\" for \"membrojn\" \"members\"); dropped adjectival agreement; broke up the table of concords, changed other small grammatical words such as \"ey\" for \"kaj\" \"and\", and treated pronouns more like nouns, so that the plural of \"li\" \"he\" is \"lin\" rather than \"ili\" \"they\", and the accusative of \"ĝi\" \"it\" is \"ju\".\n\nRomániço (1991) is designed to be more intuitive for native speakers of English. It replaces vocabulary and some grammar with Romance constructions, allows a somewhat more irregular orthography, and eliminates some criticized points such as case, adjectival agreement, verbal inflection for tense and mood, and inherent gender, but retains the \"o, a, e\" suffixes for parts of speech and an agglutinative morphology. It is intended as a compromise between Esperanto and naturalistic conlangs such as Interlingua.\n\n\"Esperanto sen Fleksio\" (Esperanto without inflexion), proposed under this name by Richard Harrison in 1996 but based on long-term complaints from Asian Esperantists, is an experimental and unfinished proposal for a morphologically reduced variety of Esperanto. The main changes are:\n\n\nIn an earlier version, the letter \"ŭ\" was replaced with \"w\", but the more recent version uses the same alphabet as regular Esperanto.\n\nWhile most Esperantidos aim to simplify Esperanto, \"Poliespo\" (\"polysynthetic Esperanto\", ) makes it considerably more complex. Besides the polysynthetic morphology, it incorporates much of the phonology and vocabulary of the Cherokee language. It has fourteen vowels, six of them nasalized, and three tones.\n\nThere are also extensions of Esperanto created primarily for amusement.\n\nOne of the more interesting Esperantidos, grammatically, is \"Universal\" (1923–1928). It adds a schwa to break up consonant clusters, marks the accusative case with a nasal vowel, has inclusive and exclusive pronouns, uses partial reduplication for the plural (\"tablo\" \"table\", \"tatablo\" \"tables\"), and inversion for antonyms (\"mega\" \"big\", \"gema\" \"little\"; \"donu\" \"give\", \"nodu\" \"receive\"; \"tela\" \"far\", \"leta\" \"near\"). Inversion can be seen in:\n\nThe antonyms are \"al\" \"he\" and \"la\" \"she\" (compare \"li\" \"s/he\"), the \"ge-\" (completive) and \"eg-\" (inchoative) aspects, \"fin-\" \"to finish\" and \"nif-\" \"to begin\", and \"graf-\" \"to write\" and \"farg-\" \"to read\".\n\nThe \"Universal\" reduplicated plural and inverted antonyms are reminiscent of the musical language Solresol.\n\n\"Esperant’\" () is a style of speech that twists but does not quite violate the grammar of Esperanto.\n\nThe changes are morphological:\n\nExample:\n\nLiterally, \"Behold (the) love of group of boys to the pretty-girl.\"\n\nSee the Esperant’ \"Pater noster\" below.\n\nThere are various projects to adapt Esperanto to specialized uses. \"Esperanto de DLT\" (1983) is one; it was an adaptation of Esperanto as a pivot language for machine translation.\n\nEsperanto has little in the way of the slang, dialectical variation, or archaisms found in natural languages. Several authors have felt a need for such variation, either for effect in original literature, or to translate such variation from national literature.\n\nOccasionally, reform projects have been used by Esperanto authors to play the role of dialects, for example standard Esperanto and Ido to translate a play written in two dialects of Italian. \n\nHalvelik (1973) created \"\" (\"Popular Idiom\") to play the role of a substandard register of Esperanto that, among other things, does away with much of Esperanto's inflectional system. For example, standard Esperanto\n\nis in Popido,\n\nIn 1969, he published part I of the Sociolekto Triopo, Arkaika Esperanto to serve as equivalent to Middle English, Middle High German and the like.\n\nA slang completes the trio, called .\n\nProto-Esperanto would theoretically fulfill the need for archaism, but too little survives for it to be used extensively. In 1931 Kalman Kalocsay published a translation of the Funeral Sermon and Prayer, the first Hungarian text (12th century), in which he created fictitious archaic forms as though Esperanto were a Romance language deriving from Vulgar Latin.\n\nManuel Halvelik went further in 1969 with a book on \"Arcaicam Esperantom,\" where he laid out the grammar of a fictitious ancestor of modern Esperanto. It echoes Proto-Esperanto in a more complex set of inflections, including dative and genitive cases ending in \"-d\" and \"-es\" and separate verbal inflections for person and number, as well as \"retention\" of digraphs such as \"ph\" and \"tz,\" writing \"c\" for , and the use of the letters \"q\", \"y\", \"w\".\n\nThe Esperanto Pater noster follows, compared to the Ido, \"Esperant’\" and \"Arcaicam Esperantom\" versions.\n"}

It is regarded as semantically null or a place holder. Expletives are not insignificant or meaningless in all senses; they may be used to give emphasis or tone, to contribute to the meter in verse, or to indicate tense. The word \"expletive\" derives from the Latin word \"expletivus\": Serving to fill out or take up space. \n\nIn these examples \"In fact\" and \"indeed\" are expletives:\n\nIn conversation the expressions \"like\" and \"you know\", when they are not meaningful, are expletives. Oaths or profanities may be expletives, as occurs in Shakespeare:\n\nThe word \"expletive\" is also commonly defined as a profanity or curse word, apart from its grammatical function.\n\nAt the start of the modern English era the use of the word “do” as an expletive came into fashion with no fixed principle guiding it. It began to appear often in phrases such as \"they do hunt\" (rather than \"they hunt\"), and the practice was slow to fade from use. The lingering and indiscriminate use of the expletive “do” lent a point to Alexander Pope’s jibe (which contains an example of \"do\" as an expletive): \n\nExpletive negation is a term that originated in French language studies. It refers to a sentence construction that contains one or more negations that, from a modern perspective, seem superfluous. An example is the “double-negative” in: \"Nobody never lifted a finger to help her.\" Expletive negation is a standard usage in Old English, and in Middle English, as in this sentence, where, from a modern perspective, \"not\" and the negative marker \"ne\" seem to be not required:\n\nThe popularity of the phrase \"expletive deleted\" derives from the Watergate hearings in the United States in the 1970s, where the phrase was used to replace profanity that occurred in the transcripts of conversations that were recorded in the White House.\n\nThe use of the word expletive for a profanity did not begin in the 1970s; an early example occurs in a sermon by Isaac Barrow published in 1741.\n\nA syntactic expletive is a term used in formal linguistic theories. It is a term for a pronoun that is used at the start of a sentence or clause when the referent is not immediately known, but an argument for the verb is syntactically required. The basic meaning of the clause is made explicit after the verb. Common forms of construction for sentences that contain a syntactic expletive begin with \"it is\", \"here is\", or \"there is\". The expletive serves as the grammatical subject of the independent clause that it begins. In a clause like “it is raining” the referent of the pronoun “it” is not obvious, and is the subject of discussion and alternate theories among linguists. Syntactic expletives have great significance in the study of the history of languages and cross-cultural comparisons. The term is distinct from the expletives of traditional grammar in that a syntactic expletive has a particular syntactical meaning.\n\nSimple examples of syntactic expletives are the words \"it\" and \"there\":\n\nExpletive, pleonastic, or dummy subjects have been crucial to syntactic argumentation. Their lack of semantic content, and their staunch grammatical aspect provide a method to explore differences between syntax and semantics.\n\n"}
{"id": "2356136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2356136", "title": "Film frame", "text": "Film frame\n\nIn filmmaking, video production, animation, and related fields, a frame is one of the many still images which compose the complete \"moving picture\". The term is derived from the fact that, from the beginning of modern filmmaking toward the end of the 20th century, and in many places still up to the present, the single images have been recorded on a strip of photographic film that quickly increased in length, historically; each image on such a strip looks rather like a framed picture when examined individually.\n\nThe term may also be used more generally as a noun or verb to refer to the edges of the image as seen in a camera viewfinder or projected on a screen. Thus, the camera operator can be said to keep a car in frame by panning with it as it speeds past.\n\nWhen the moving picture is displayed, each frame is flashed on a screen for a short time (nowadays, usually 1/24, 1/25 or 1/30 of a second) and then immediately replaced by the next one. Persistence of vision blends the frames together, producing the illusion of a moving image. \n\nThe frame is also sometimes used as a unit of time, so that a momentary event might be said to last six frames, the actual duration of which depends on the frame rate of the system, which varies according to the video or film standard in use. In North America and Japan, 30 frames per s:) (fps) is the broadcast standard, with 24 frames/s now common in production for high-definition video shot to look like film. In much of the rest of the world, 25 frames/s is standard. \n\nIn systems historically based on NTSC standards, for reasons originally related to the Chromilog NTSC TV systems, the exact frame rate is actually (3579545 / 227.5) / 525 = 29.97002616 fps. This leads to many synchronization problems which are unknown outside the NTSC world, and also brings about hacks such as drop-frame timecode.\n\nIn film projection, 24 fps is the norm, except in some special venue systems, such as IMAX, Showscan and Iwerks 70, where 30, 48 or even 60 frame/s have been used. Silent films and 8 mm amateur movies used 16 or 18 frame/s.\n\nIn a strip of movie film, individual frames are separated by frame lines. Normally, 24 frames are needed for one second of film. In ordinary filming, the frames are photographed automatically, one after the other, in a movie camera. In special effects or animation filming, the frames are often shot one at a time.\n\nThe size of a film frame varies, depending on the still film format or the motion picture film format. In the smallest 8 mm amateur format for motion pictures film, it is only about 4.8 by 3.5 mm, while an IMAX frame is as large as 69.6 by 48.5 mm. The larger the frame size is in relation to the size of the projection screen, the sharper the image will appear.\n\nThe size of the film frame of motion picture film also depends on the location of the holes, the size of the holes, the shape of the holes. and the location and type of sound stripe.\n\nThe most common film format, 35 mm, has a frame size of 36 by 24 mm when used in a still 35 mm camera where the film moves horizontally, but the frame size varies when used for motion picture where the film moves vertically (with the exception of VistaVision and Technirama where the film moves horizontally). Using a 4-perf pulldown, there are exactly 16 frames in one foot of 35 mm film, leading to film frames sometimes being counted in terms of \"feet and frames\". The maximum frame size is 18 by 24 mm, (silent/full aperture), but this is significantly reduced by the application of sound track(s). A system called KeyKode is often used to identify specific physical film frames in a production.\n\nHistorically, video frames were represented as analog waveforms in which varying voltages represented the intensity of light in an analog raster scan across the screen. Analog blanking intervals separated video frames in the same way that frame lines did in film. For historical reasons, most systems used an interlaced scan system in which the frame typically consisted of two video fields sampled over two slightly different periods of time. This meant that a single video frame was usually not a good still picture of the scene, unless the scene being shot was completely still.\n\nWith the dominance of digital technology, modern video systems now represent the video frame as a rectangular raster of pixels, either in an RGB color space or a color space such as YCbCr, and the analog waveform is typically found nowhere other than in legacy I/O devices.\n\nStandards for the digital video frame raster include Rec. 601 for standard-definition television and Rec. 709 for high-definition television.\n\nVideo frames are typically identified using SMPTE time code.\n\nThe frame is composed of picture elements just like a chess board. Each horizontal set of picture elements is known as a line. The picture elements in a line are transmitted as sine signals where a pair of dots, one dark and one light can be represented by a single sine. The product of the number of lines and the number of maximum sine signals per line is known as the total resolution of the frame. The higher the resolution the more faithful the displayed image is to the original image. But higher resolution introduces technical problems and extra cost. So a compromise should be reached in system designs both for satisfactory image quality and affordable price.\n\nThe key parameter to determine the lowest resolution still satisfactory to viewers is the viewing distance, i.e. the distance between the eyes and the monitor. The total resolution is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. If d is the distance, r is the required minimum resolution and k is the proportionality constant which depends on the size of the monitor;\n\nSince the number of lines is approximately proportional to the resolution per line, the above relation can also be written as\n\nwhere n is the number of lines. That means that the required resolution is proportional to the height of the monitor and inversely proportional to the viewing distance.\n\nIn moving picture (TV) the number of frames scanned per second is known as the frame rate. The higher the frame rate, the better the sense of motion. But again, increasing the frame rate introduces technical difficulties. So the frame rate is fixed at 25 (System B/G) or 29.97 (System M). To increase the sense of motion it is customary to scan the very same frame in two consecutive phases. In each phase only half of the lines are scanned; only the lines with odd numbers in the first phase and only the lines with even numbers in the second phase. Each scan is known as a field. So the field rate is two times the frame rate.\n\nIn system B the number of lines is 625 and the frame rate is 25. The maximum video bandwidth is 5 MHz. The maximum number of sine signals the system is theorically capable of transmitting is given as follows:\n\nThe system is able to transmit 5 000 000 sine signals in a second. Since the frame rate is 25, the maximum number of sine signals per frame is 200 000. Dividing this number by the number of lines gives the maximum number of sine signals in a line which is 320. (Actually about 19% of each line is devoted to auxiliary services. So the number of maximum useful sine signals is about 260.)\n\nA still frame is a single static image taken from a film or video, which are kinetic (moving) images. Still frames are also called freeze frame, video prompt, preview or misleadingly thumbnail, keyframe, poster frame, or screen shot/grab/capture/dump. Freeze frames are widely used on video platforms and in video galleries, to show viewers a preview or a teaser. Many video platforms have a standard to display a frame from mid-time of the video. Some platforms offer the option to choose a different frame individually.\n\nVideo and film artists sometimes use still frames within the video/film to achieve special effects, like freeze-frame shots or still motion.\n\nFor criminal investigations it has become a frequent use to publish still frames from surveillance videos in order to identify suspect persons and to find more witnesses. Videos of the 9/11 attacks have been often discussed frame-by-frame for various interpretations. For medical diagnostics it is very useful to watch still frames of Magnetic resonance imaging videos.\n\nSome humor in animation is based on the fourth wall aspect of the film frame itself, with some animation showing characters leaving what is assumed to be the edge of the film or the film malfunctioning. This latter one is used often in films as well.\nThis hearkens back to some early cartoons, where characters were aware that they were in a cartoon, specifically that they could look at the credits and be aware of something that isn't part of the story as presented. These jokes include:\n\n\n"}

It is also called by its native speakers as \"sãotomense\" creole or \"santomense\" creole.\n\nIt should not be confused with São Tomean Portuguese, the non-creolised form of Portuguese spoken in São Tomé and Príncipe, also spoken by majority of São Toméans.\n\nSão Tomé is an island of the Gulf of Guinea, discovered by the Portuguese in the 15th century. It was uninhabited at the time, but Portuguese settlers used the island as a center of the slave trade, and there was a need for slaves in the island. Since both parties needed to communicate, a pidgin was formed. The substrate languages were from the Bantu and Kwa groups. This pidgin then became fixed (creolized) as it became the mother language of children born from Portuguese men and African women slaves. Mixed marriages were then encouraged by the Portuguese Crown, for the sake of settlement.\n\nLater because of Dutch and French pressure to gain the island, many Portuguese settlers left. Children of Portuguese and black women were, eventually, not considered African or slaves; some were considered full right Portuguese citizens. Those mixed-raced that did not have the status of Portuguese, those with darker skin, often gained a \"forro\" designation, because their Portuguese fathers did not want to enslave their children. The São Tomean Creole is mostly known as \"Forro\", the language of the freed slaves or Crioulo Santomense, not to be confused with São Tomean Portuguese (a variety and dialect of Portuguese in São Tomé and Príncipe). Portuguese is the main language for children until their early 20s, when they relearn Forro Creole. The rich São Tomean culture also preserves a unique mixture of Portuguese and African cultures.\n\nForro is a creole language based on Portuguese, the superstrate language. The substrate languages were from the Bantu and Kwa groups. It is most similar to Principense Creole, Angolar Creole and Annobonese Creole.\n\nForro Creole is spoken mainly in São Tomé Island (most of it); there are some speakers in Principe Island.\n\nDue to their great similarity and historical derivation, Principe Island's Principense Creole and Equatorial Guinea's Annobonese Creole may be regarded as dialects of Forro Creole. Forro's lexical similarity is 77% with Principense Creole, 62% with Fa d’Ambu Creole and 70% with Angolar Creole.\n\nAlthough the São Tomean Creole had (and still has) a restricted contact with Portuguese (seen as a prestigious language), it did preserve a larger number of the substrate languages' elements, more than the creoles of Cape Verde. Roughly 93% of São Tomean Creole lexicon is from Portuguese and 7% of African origin. Most Forro Creole speakers also speak non-creolised Portuguese.\n\nAlthough 95% of São Tomeans speak Portuguese and it is the country's national language, Forro Creole is traditionally said to be spoken by 85% of the inhabitants of São Tomé Island, or 81.7% of the country’s population. However, official census figures state that only 36.2% of the population can speak Forro Creole, and the creole is now considered threatened.\n\nThere is no standard orthography.\n\nNot everything is from Portuguese:\n\n"}

He had been under pressure before then to withdraw remarks he had made an Oireactas (Parliamentary) committee that whistleblowers within the force, such as Sergeant Maurice McCabe and John Wilson, were \"disgusting\".\n\nMinister for Justice, Alan Shatter, resigned after receipt of a report into the handling of Garda whistleblowers by the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána. A week previous to this, the Data Protection Commissioner found he had illegally revealed Garda information about a political opponent while debating the issue of cancelled penalty points live on national television.\n\nBoth men had been embroiled in a controversy at the beginning of 2014 regarding suspected bugging of GSOC.\n\nA commission of investigation was set up into the recording of telephone calls at Garda stations. A report into allegations of misconduct raised by one of the whistleblowers substantially vindicated the whistleblowers position and was critical of the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice.\n\nA report into the suspected bugging of GSOC was dismissive two of the three anomalies discovered by GSOC. A third anomaly could not be explained but the report did not regard that as proof that bugging took place.\n\nIn September 2013, a report of the Irish Comptroller and Auditor General said that significant revenue had been lost by the state owing to irregularities in the application of the penalty points system for driving offences. The Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, appearing thefore the Public Accounts Committee of the Oireachtas (Irish legislature) on 23 January 2014, said there was no evidence that Gardaí had cancelled penalty points for relatives or friends. Referring to two Whistleblowers, Garda Maurice McCabe and former Garda John Wilson, who had made allegations of widespread corruption with regard to penalty points, Callinan said, \"Frankly, on a personal level, I think it’s quite disgusting.” McCabe gave evidence in private to the Public Accounts Committee on 30 January. A Garda Inspectorate report, published on 12 March 2014, said there were \"consistent and widespread breaches of policy\" in regard to penalty points. Callinan came under increasing pressure to withdraw the \"disgusting\" remark, and resigned on 25 March 2014.\n\nAn \"Irish Independent\" journalist, Gemma O'Doherty, took an unfair dismissal claim against the newspaper, claiming she was sacked after visiting Callinan's home as part of her investigation into the penalty points controversy.\n\nMaurice McCabe, in addition to his evidence on penalty points, made allegations of Garda misconduct on a number of other occasions. The government appointed a Senior Counsel, Seán Guerin, to investigate these claims. The Guerin Report, published on 9 May 2014, said that nine of the ten cases reported by McCabe merited investigation by a commission of enquiry.\n\nOn Sunday 9 February 2014, the Irish edition of \"The Sunday Times\" led with a story written by journalist John Mooney. In it he outlined how the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission had suspected that it was under surveillance. Mooney explained how GSOC had hired the services of a UK counter-surveillance firm, Verrimus, to investigate.\n\nThese were revealed in the wake of Martin Callinan's resignation Tuesday 25 March 2014. The revelation had a major impact on court cases, with the first trial to be affected being that of two men suspected of IRA membership on 26 March. In response to Callinan's resignation, his Deputy Commissioner Noirín O'Sullivan was selected as provisional Garda Commissioner. The Irish government set up a statutory commission of investigation into the practice of recording telephone calls.\n\nEleven specific allegations of failure and malpractices in the Cavan-Monaghan Division of the Garda Síochána have been identified for investigation by Ireland's Minister for Justice. The most serious of these is to examine how a murderer was let out on bail after committing two other serious assaults.\n\nOn 31 March 2015, Mick Wallace TD told the Dáil of “serious Garda malpractice’’ in the Athlone area. In 2012, a garda personally saw Taoiseach Enda Kenny in Castlebar and told him about malpractice \"in relation to a certain superintendent\". Wallace told the Taoiseach: \"Later that same year you gave approval to the promotion of this superintendent to chief superintendent\". This same chief superintendent was reported to be the subject of three different investigations.\n"}

Several of his poems and songs have been used in Hindi movies and are considered famous. He wrote songs for several Hindi Movies and attained a unique position as a songwriter who wrote with equal facility in both Hindi and Urdu.\n\nIn the television interview, Gopaldas Neeraj called himself an unlucky poet which led to his stopping himself from writing film songs and confining himself to just writing and getting his poems published. The reason for this mentioned by him was that at least two or three prominent Music Directors of the Hindi Film Industry for whom he wrote very successful and popular songs, had expired. He mentioned the death of Jaikishan of the music duo Shankar-Jaikishan as well as of S.D.Burman or Sachin Dev Burman, for both of whom he had written highly popular film songs. The deaths of these Music Directors when they as well as Gopaldas Neeraj were at the peak of their popularity, left him very depressed and he made a decision to quit the film industry. He used to perform in Hindi kavi sammelan until few days ago of his demise.\n\nAs of 2012, Neeraj was the chancellor of Mangalayatan University, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nOn 19 July 2018 poet Gopaldas Neeraj died.

{"id": "40241763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40241763", "title": "Growth hacking", "text": "Growth hacking\n\nGrowth hacking is a process of rapid experimentation across marketing funnel, product development, sales segments, and other areas of the business to identify the most efficient ways to grow a business. A growth hacking team is made up of marketers, developers, engineers and product managers that specifically focus on building and engaging the user base of a business.\n\nGrowth hackers often focus on low-cost alternatives to traditional marketing, e.g. using social media, viral marketing or targeted advertising instead of buying advertising through more traditional media such as radio, newspaper, and television.\n\nGrowth hacking is particularly prevalent with startups, when the goal is rapid growth in the early-stages of launching a new product or service to market. Growth hacking may focus on lowering cost per customer acquisition, or it may focus on long-term sustainability as Mason Pelt points out in a 2015 article on SiliconANGLE.com \"The goal of any marketing should be long-term sustainable growth, not just a short-term gain. Growth hacking is about optimization as well as lead generation. Imagine your business is a bucket and your leads are water. You don't want to pour water into a leaky bucket; it's a waste of money. That's why a true growth hacker would care about customer retention.\"\n\nThose who specialize in growth hacking use various types of marketing and product iterations to rapidly test persuasive copy, email marketing, SEO and viral strategies, among other tools and techniques, with a goal of increasing conversion rates and achieving rapid growth of the user base. It can also involve online community management and social media outreach or highly personalized outreach to news outlets to improve performance metrics such as driving customer acquisition and selling products. Some consider growth hacking a part of the online marketing ecosystem, as in many cases growth hackers are using techniques such as search engine optimization, website analytics, content marketing and A/B testing.\n\nProduct development is also heavily influenced by the growth hacker mindset. Instead of long development cycles followed by user testing. Growth hackers start user testing with wireframes and sketches; validating ideas at every stage. A growth hacker in a product development role would start user testing in a coffee shop instead of a corporate usability lab.\n\nSean Ellis coined the term \"\"growth hacker\" in 2010. In the blog post, he defined a growth hacker as \"a person whose true north is growth. Everything they do is scrutinized by its potential impact on scalable growth.\"\" Andrew Chen introduced the term to a wider audience in a blog post titled, \"Growth Hacker is the new VP Marketing\" in which he defined the term and used the short term vacation rental platform Airbnb's integration of Craigslist as an example. He wrote that growth hackers \"are a hybrid of marketer and coder, one who looks at the traditional question of 'How do I get customers for my product?' and answers with A/B tests, landing pages, viral factor, email deliverability, and Open Graph.\" In 2012, Aaron Ginn defined a growth hacker on \"TechCrunch\" as a \"mindset of data, creativity, and curiosity.\" In the book \"Growth Hacking\", Chad Riddersen and Raymond Fong define a Growth Hacker as \"a highly resourceful and creative marketer singularly focused on high leverage growth\" \n\nThe second annual (2013) \"Growth Hackers Conference\" was held in San Francisco set up by Gagan Biyani. It featured growth hackers from LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube among others.\nIn 2015, Sean Ellis and Everette Taylor created GrowthHackers - the largest website community dedicated to growth hacking and now host the annual GrowthHackers Conference.\n\nTo combat this lack of money and experience, growth hackers approach marketing with a focus on innovation, scalability, and user connectivity. Growth hacking does not, however, separate product design and product effectiveness from marketing. Growth hackers build the product's potential growth, including user acquisition, on-boarding, monetization, retention, and virality, into the product itself. \"Fast Company\" used Twitter \"Suggested Users List\" as example: \"This was Twitter's real secret: It built marketing into the product rather than building infrastructure to do a lot of marketing.\" However growth hacking isn't always free. TechCrunch shared several nearly free growth hacks explaining that growth hacking is effective marketing and not mythical marketing pixie dust. As new tools(SaaS) come out specifically that focus on more advanced forms of Growth Hacking, more and more tools are being offered as free.\n\nThe heart of growth hacking is the relentless focus on growth as the only metric that truly matters. Mark Zuckerberg had this mindset while growing Facebook. While the exact methods vary from company to company and from one industry to the next, the common denominator is always growth. Companies that have successfully \"growth hacked\" usually have a viral loop naturally built into their onboarding process. New customers typically hear about the product or service through their network and by using the product or service, share it with their connections in turn. This loop of awareness, use, and sharing can result in exponential growth for the company.\n\nGrowth hacking frames the user acquisition process through the \"funnel\" metaphor (in short, new users flow through a 5-stage funnel - acquisition, activation, retention, revenue, referral). Rapidly optimizing this process is a core goal of growth hacking, since making each stage of the funnel more efficient will increase the number of users in the most advantageous stages of the funnel.\n\nTwitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Pinterest, YouTube, Groupon, Udemy, Instagram and Google are all companies that used and still use growth hacking techniques to build brands and improve profits.\n\nAn early example of \"\"growth hacking\" was Hotmail's inclusion of \"PS I Love You\"\" with a link for others to get the free online mail service. Another example was the offer of more storage by Dropbox to users who referred their friends.\n\nOnline worldwide independent lodging company, Airbnb, is an example of growth hacking by coupling technology and ingenuity. Airbnb realized they could essentially hack the Craiglist.org scale and tap both into their user base as well as their website by adding automated listing generators from Airbnb with the feature called \"Post to Craigslist\". The company's growth was a combination of clever thinking and technical know-how.\n\nOne of the easiest examples of \"growth hacking\" is to add \"?sub_confirmation=1\" at the end of your Youtube channel URL. Everybody will see a popup \"Confirm Channel Subscription\" (works only on desktops). This growth hacking tactic increases YouTube subscribers by 400%.\n\nNoah Kagan's submission form had four fields: Name, Email, URL, Revenue. He decided to remove the \"revenue\" field altogether, leaving only three fields—Name, Email and URL. This small change meant an improvement in his conversion rate of 26%.\n\nThe University of Alberta increased email subscribers by 500% using a popup survey by Qualaroo that asked anyone who spent more than \"10 seconds\" on the site: “You seem interested in UAlberta news. Would you like to sign up for the Daily News email?”.\n"}

For discussion of other dialects, see Macedonian dialects. Macedonian possesses five vowels, one semivowel, three liquid consonants, three nasal stops, three pairs of fricatives, two pairs of affricates, a non-paired voiceless fricative, nine pairs of voiced and unvoiced consonants and four pairs of stops.\n\nThe schwa is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to or ) but its use in the standard language is marginal. When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an apostrophe is used; for example, , , etc. When spelling aloud, each consonant is followed by the schwa. The individual letters of acronyms are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: (). The lexicalized acronyms () and () (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions.\n\nVowel length is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penult can be realized as long, e.g. 'Veles'. The sequence is often realized phonetically as ; e.g. \"'colloq.\" hour'.\n\n The alveolar trill () is syllabic between two consonants; for example, 'finger'. The dental nasal () and dental lateral () are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. 'newton', 'Popocatépetl', etc.\n\nThe labiodental nasal occurs as an allophone of before and (e.g. 'tram').

This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source. The following rules apply:\n\nFor example, 'child', 'mother' and 'father'.\n\nFor example, 'mountain', 'the mountain' and 'the mountaineers'.\n\nExceptions include:\n\n"}

A person who repeatedly violates this law by informing on his fellow Jews is considered subject to \"Din Moser\" (law of the informer), which is analogous to \"Din rodef\" in that both prescribe death for the offender, and according to some, in some circumstances he may be killed without warning.\n\nThe source of the ban comes from the Bava Kamma (HE:בבא קמא) section of the Babylonian Talmud. Probably the law was instigated to ease Jewish life under Roman or Persian rule. This law is discussed in Babylonian Talmud, by Rambam and in Shulchan Aruch. Shulchan Aruch, however, states that in the cases that if Jews do not testify against other Jews in the gentile court, it will be obvious that Jews are covering up for each other, they should testify.\n\nMaimonides states: \n\nMaimonides further explains: \"It is forbidden to hand over a Jew to the heathen, neither his person nor his goods, even if he is wicked and a sinner, even if he causes distress and pain to fellow-Jews. Whoever hands over a Jew to the heathen has no part in the next world. It is permitted to kill a moser (informant) wherever he is. It is even permitted to kill him before he has handed over (a fellow Jew).\"\n\nAccording to Michael Broyde, there are many different opinions among 20th-century rabbis as to the extent and circumstances \"mesirah\" is still valid in modern times.\n\nAccording to \"The Times of Israel\" and a Channel 4 investigation, the concept of mesirah was used by a Haredi leader to protect community members investigated for child molestation from police investigation. \n\nThe principle of mesirah has also been used to dissuade Jewish auditors from reporting other Jews to the IRS for tax fraud.\n\nRabbinic courts in Israel have been known to issue writs calling for social exclusion of Jews bringing legal issues to Israel's civil courts.\n\nRabbi Chaim Kanievsky, a leading Israeli rabbi and \"posek\" in Haredi Jewish society ruled that reporting instances of sexual child abuse to the police is consistent with Jewish law.. Other major Orthodox poskim in America, such as Rabbi Hershel Shachter also concur that abuse cases should be reported in full to the civil authorities. \n\nMesirah has also been cited as one of the main reasons for the gross underreporting in the Sexual abuse cases in Brooklyn's Haredi community.\n\nThe \"mesirah\" doctrine came under intense public scrutiny in Australia in early 2015 as a result of evidence given to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse relating to an alleged long-running and systematic cover-up of child sexual abuse and the institutional protection of perpetrators at the exclusive Melbourne boys' school Yeshiva College. Fairfax Media on 28 January 2015 reported secret tape recordings and emails had been disclosed which revealed members of Australia's Orthodox Jewish community who assisted police investigations into alleged child sexual abuse were pressured to remain silent on the matter. Criminal barrister Alex Lewenberg was alleged to have been \"disappointed\", and to have berated a Jew who had been a victim of a Jewish sex offender and whom he subsequently regarded as a mossur for breaking with Mesirah tradition. Lewenberg was subsequently found guilty of professional misconduct.\n\nIn February 2015 Mr Zephaniah Waks, an adherent of the ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Chabad sect in Melbourne, Australia, testified to the Royal Commission that following his discovery that one of his sons had been sexually abused by Rabbi David Kramer, a teacher at their school, Yeshiva College, he confronted the school's principal, Rabbi Abraham Glick and demanded that Kramer be sacked. Mr Waks told of his shock when he learned a few days later that Kramer was still working at the school, and that he again confronted Rabbi Glick, who then claimed that Kramer had admitted his guilt \"because he wanted to be caught\" but that the school could not dismiss Kramer because (Glick claimed) he was at risk of self-harm. Mr Waks also told the Commission that despite his anger, he felt constrained not to go to the authorities because of the doctrine of \"mesirah\":\n\nGiving evidence to the Commission on the day before his father, Mr Menachem (Manny) Waks, one of three children from the Waks family who were sexually abused by staff at Yeshiva College, testified that after breaking \"mesirah\" by going public about his abuse, he and his family had been ostracised by rabbinical leaders, shunned by his community and subjected to a sustained campaign of abuse, intimidation and threats, which eventually forced Mr Waks to leave Australia with his wife and children. He also testified about how members of the exclusive Chabad community had pressured him to abandon his advocacy:\n\nCounsel Assisting the commission then asked Mr Waks how he felt having been accused of being an informer:\n\nIn December 2017, the Commission's final report included a recommendation to Jewish institutions:\n\n"}

The opening statement is generally constructed to serve as a \"road map\" for the fact-finder. This is especially essential, in many jury trials, since jurors (at least theoretically) know nothing at all about the case before the trial, (or if they do, they are strictly instructed by the judge to put preconceived notions aside). Though such statements may be dramatic and vivid, they must be limited to the evidence reasonably expected to be presented during the trial. Attorneys generally conclude opening statements with a reminder that at the conclusion of evidence, the attorney will return to ask the fact-finder to find in his or her client's favor.\n\nOpening statements are, in theory, not allowed to be argumentative, or suggest the inferences that fact-finders should draw from the evidence they will hear. In actual practice, the line between statement and argument is often unclear and many attorneys will infuse at least a little argumentation into their opening (often prefacing borderline arguments with some variation on the phrase, \"As we will show you...\"). Objections, though permissible during opening statements, are very unusual, and by professional courtesy are usually reserved only for egregious conduct.\n\nGenerally, the prosecution in a criminal case and plaintiff in a civil case is the first to offer an opening statement, and defendants go second. Defendants are also allowed the option of delaying their opening statement until after the close of the prosecution or plaintiff's case. Few take this option, however, so as not to allow the other party's argument to stand uncontradicted for so long.\n\nThe techniques of opening statements are taught in courses on trial advocacy. The opening statement is integrated with the overall case strategy through either a theme and theory or, with more advanced strategies, a line of effort. Specific tactics that can be incorporated in an opening statement are audio-visual elements, a clear overview of the coming presentation, and using deposition testimony to highlight key information they can expect of upcoming witnesses.\n\n\n"}

His mother played traditional fiddle, as did his cousin Barney Enright of Moyvane. Pat's brother Seán is a singer and plays the uilleann pipes. Pat learnt the fiddle from his mother, and Irish step-dancing from the famous Kerry dance master Jeremiah Molyneaux. Pat attended primary school in Moyvane (1938–1944), subsequently enrolling at St Michael's College, Listowel (1944–1948). He studied for the Catholic priesthood at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth National Seminary (1950–1957); while there he studied piano and organ under Charles O'Callaghan. He was ordained in 1957, and that year appointed curate in St. John's Parish Tralee, County Kerry, with special responsibility for liturgical music. There he founded St. John's Gregorian Choir.\n\nIn 1959 he studied for the B.Mus. degree at University College, Cork under Aloys Fleischmann, with Tilly Fleischmann as his piano teacher. He graduated in 1962. In 1967 he was sent to the Catholic Communications Centre, Booterstown, Dublin, to study Radio and Television production and to set up and direct a Radio Production and Training Unit for clergy and religious. He produced a weekly religious radio programme for RTÉ radio, entitled ‘Network’. Recalled to Kerry in 1973, he was released from parish work by his bishop to devote himself to his work on folk theatre. In 1965 he had founded the group Siamsóirí na Ríochta [Entertainers of the Kingdom] out of which in 1972 developed Siamsa Tíre [Entertainment of the Land], the Folk Theatre of Ireland. Ahern was artistic director until he retired in 1997. He brought the company all over Ireland and travelled the world with it, enchanting audiences wherever they went. He retired in 1997, but continues to organise concerts and stage productions.\nIn 1958, a year after taking up his duties as curate in the parish of Tralee, Pat Ahern devised and produced a pageant based on the story of Lourdes entitled \"Massabielle\", involving the parish choir, parish societies and theatre groups, in a celebration to mark the centenary of the Lourdes apparitions. It was presented in the Catholic Young Men's Hall, Tralee.\nIn 1959 he produced a second parish pageant: \"Bethlehem\", the story of Christmas. Then 1963 saw the production of a third parish pageant: \"Golgotha\", the story of the Passion of Christ, involving a cast of 120, in the style of the celebrated Passion Play at Oberammergau in Bavaria. In 1964 \"Massabielle\" was reproduced in Tralee.\n\nLater pageants:\n\nIn 1964 Ahern initiated a series of experiments in the promotion of traditional Irish folk culture with a small group of musicians, singers and dancers, drawn from the cast of \"Golgotha\", and using the medium of the theatre as a focus for the experiments. In1965 the Irish television producer, Liam Ó Murchú of RTÉ, commissioned four 30-minute TV programmes by the group for the Irish Music TV series \"Aililiú\". Thenceforward the group was known as \"Siamsóirí na Ríochta\" – The Entertainers of the Kingdom (of Kerry).\n\nIn 1968 the first Folk Theatre production was presented by the group in Tralee, twice weekly through July and August. They called the new show, \"SIAMSA\", Irish for \"a coming together for merrymaking\". In January and May 1969 \"SIAMSA\" was presented at the Dublin Peacock Theatre and at the Abbey Theatre, in 1970 in the Abbey Theatre and the same year in the Cork School of Music, at the invitation of the Joan Denise Moriarty's Cork Ballet Company, and then on Saint Patrick's Day 1971 at the Cork Opera House. At Christmas 1971 the Siamsa Tíre company presented a special Christmas show on RTE television: \"Coinnle na Nollag\".\n\nIn 1972, at the request of Éamonn Casey, Bishop of Kerry, and Brendan O'Regan, Chairman of Bórd Fáilte, the Irish Tourist Board, a ten-year plan was drawn up by Ahern for the development of the Tralee folk theatre, now known nationally as \"Siamsa Tíre\". The first appearance of the newly constituted group took place in Galway, at the Taibhdhearc theatre, in April 1972. The following year Bishop Casey recalled Ahern from Dublin to Kerry, and released him from diocesan commitments to work full-time on the new folk theatre project in Tralee.\n\nIn 1974 Siamsa Tíre was incorporated as a company, funded by Bord Fáilte, the Irish Tourist Board, and by Roinn na Gaeltachta (the government department for Irish-speaking districts); Pat Ahern was artistic director and Martin Whelan the manager until his death in 2002. Ahern's aim: \"To provide through the medium of the theatre an attractive means of accessing our rich cultural heritage. … The Irish language enshrines a vast reservoir of story, poetry and song that is unique among the cultures of the world. Irish scholars, collectors and musicians have left a veritable library of Irish songs and dance tunes, many of which have never been sung or played to the living generations.\" Siamsa Tíre was to seek ways \"of bringing these lost treasures to the ears of future audiences, in new and evocative settings, thus making them familiar again and musically interesting to the contemporary ear.\"\n\nThe establishment of rural training centres was a key concept of Siamsa Tíre's Founding Document of 1972. The rural centre, Tithe Siamsa (Siamsa houses), was to serve as a meeting-place for the people of the district, to provide experience of and training in music, dance and story-telling, and a filter-point where the native talents and folk wealth of the district would be assembled and researched. The first house, \"Teach Siamsa\", opened in 1974 at Finuge, north Kerry; it focused on the north Kerry dance tradition. The second opened the following year at Carraig in the west Kerry Gaeltacht, with a focus on the Irish language tradition.\n\nIn 1978 Siamsa Tíre moved into the refurbished Theatre Royal Cinema in Tralee. From 1982 Ahern began collaborations with artists from other folk traditions, among others with Argentinian, Bulgarian and Spanish dancers. Up to 1985 the members of the company had all been amateurs, employed on a part-time basis; now a core group of four professionals was established. An educational programme for school visits was devised. In 1991 the company moved into a specially built theatre in Tralee. It opened with a new production, \"Ding Dong Dedero – Forging the Dance\", which explored the process of acquiring one's tradition through the story of young Jerry Molyneaux, son of a north Kerry blacksmith, who became the most influential dance master in Munster, and whose dance has been preserved as a key ingredient of the Siamsa Tíre idiom of folk theatre.\n\nThe significance of Siamsa Tíre was summed up by the writer Frank Delaney in 1976 just before the company's first tour to the United States: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Both formalisms are Turing complete.\n\nA Post canonical system is a triplet (A,I,R), where\n\n\nwhere each and is a specified fixed word, and each \"$\" and \"$' \" is a variable standing for an arbitrary word.

The term is attributed to Robson Lowe, a professional philatelist, stamp dealer and stamp auctioneer, who made the first organised study of the subject in the 1930s and described philatelists as \"students of science\", but postal historians as \"students of humanity\". More precisely, philatelists describe postal history as the study of rates, routes, markings, and means (of transport).\n\nPostal history has become a philatelic collecting speciality in its own right. Whereas traditional philately is concerned with the study of the stamps \"per se\", including the technical aspects of stamp production and distribution, philatelic postal history refers to stamps as historical documents; similarly re postmarks, postcards, envelopes and the letters they contain. Postal history can include the study of postal rates, postal policy, postal administration, political effects on postal systems, postal surveillance and the consequences of politics, business, and culture on postal systems; basically anything to do with the function of the collection, transportation and delivery of mail. The specialized area of philatelic history defines postal history as the study of rates charged for postal services provided, routes followed and special handling of letters. Areas of special interest include disrupted or transitional periods, such as wars and military occupations, and mail to remote areas.\n\nThe philatelic-based definition of the term developed as the discipline developed. Philatelic students discovered that understanding and authentication of stamps depended on knowing why postal authorities issued particular stamps, where they were used and how. For instance, a stamp apparently used before any other stamp of its type could be proved a forgery if it was postmarked at a location known not to have received any stamps until a later date.\n\nMuch information is still not known about the workings of postal systems, and millions of old covers have survived, constituting a rich field of \"artifacts\" for analysis.\n\nIn studying or collecting any postal history subject some overlap is inevitable because it is impossible to separate the different areas that affect the mail from one another; transportation, rates, geography and subject are all intertwined, but the emphasis remains different depending on the chosen topic. The postal history topics described below are some of the better known and popular topics.\n\n\nThe era for a geographical based study can add dimension depending on the services available or the changes that took place.

It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the oldest Scandinavian Elder Futhark inscriptions, spoken from around the 2nd to the 8th centuries CE (corresponding to the late Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age). It evolved into the dialects of Old Norse at the beginning of the Viking Age around 800 CE, which later themselves evolved into the modern North Germanic languages (Faroese, Icelandic, the three Continental Scandinavian languages, and their dialects).\n\nProto-Norse phonology probably did not differ substantially from that of Proto-Germanic. Although the phonetic realisation of several phonemes had probably changed over time (as with any language), the overall system of phonemes and their distribution remained largely unchanged.\n\n\nThe system of vowels differed somewhat more from that of Proto-Germanic than the consonants. Earlier had been lowered to , and unstressed and had developed into and . Shortening of word-final vowels had eliminated the Proto-Germanic overlong vowels.\n\n\nAt least the following diphthongs were present: , , , .\n\n\nOld Norse had a stress accent which fell on the first syllable. Several scholars have proposed that Proto-Norse also had a separate pitch accent, which was inherited from Proto-Indo-European and has evolved into the tonal accents of modern Swedish and Norwegian, which in turn have evolved into the stød of modern Danish. Another recently advanced theory is that each Proto-Norse long syllable and every other short syllable received stress, marked by pitch, eventually leading to the development of the Swedish and Norwegian tonal accent distinction. Finally, quite a number of linguists have assumed that even the first phonetic rudiments of the distinction did not appear until the Old Norse period.\n\nThe surviving examples of Proto-Norse are all runic inscriptions in the Elder Futhark. There are about 260 surviving Elder Futhark inscriptions in Proto-Norse, the earliest dating to the 2nd century.\n\n\nNumerous early Germanic words have survived largely unchanged as borrowings in Finnic languages. Some of these may be of Proto-Germanic origin or older still, but others reflect developments specific to Norse. Some examples (with the reconstructed Proto-Norse form):\n\nA very extensive Proto-Norse loanword layer also exists in the Sami languages.\n\nSome Proto-Norse names are found in Latin works, like tribal names like \"Suiones\" (*\"Sweoniz\", \"Swedes\"). Others can be conjectured from manuscripts such as \"Beowulf\".\n\nThe differences between attested Proto-Norse and unattested Proto-Germanic are rather small. Separating Proto-Norse from Northwest Germanic can be said to be a matter of convention, as sufficient evidence from the remaining parts of the Germanic-speaking area (Northern Germany and the Netherlands) is lacking in a degree to provide sufficient comparison. Inscriptions found in Scandinavia are considered to be in Proto-Norse. Several scholars argue about this subject matter. Wolfgang von Krause sees the language of the runic inscriptions of the Proto-Norse period as an immediate precursor to Old Norse, but Elmer Antonsen views them as Northwest Germanic, but his views on Runic Script and related subjects might be considered extreme.\n\nOne early difference shared by the West Germanic dialects is the monophthongization of unstressed diphthongs. Unstressed *\"ai\" became \"ē\", as in \"haitē\" (Kragehul I) from Proto-Germanic *\"haitai\", and unstressed *\"au\" likewise became \"ō\". Characteristic is also the Proto-Norse lowering of Proto-Germanic stressed \"ē\" to \"ā\", which is demonstrated by the pair Gothic \"mēna\" and Old Norse \"máni\" (English \"moon\"). Proto-Norse thus differs from the early West Germanic dialects, as West Germanic \"ē\" was lowered to \"ā\" regardless of stress; in Old Norse, earlier unstressed \"ē\" surfaces as \"i\". For example, the weak third-person singular past tense ending \"-dē\" appears in Old High German as \"-ta, with a low vowel, but in Old Norse as \"-ði, with a high vowel.\n\nThe time that *\"z\", a voiced apical alveolar fricative, represented in runic writing by the algiz rune, changed to \"ʀ\", an apical post-alveolar approximant, is debated. If the general Proto-Norse principle of devoicing of consonants in final position is taken into account, *\"z\", if retained, would have been devoiced to and would be spelled as such in runes. There is, however, no trace of that in the Elder Futhark runic inscriptions, so it can be safely assumed that the quality of this consonant must have changed before the devoicing, or the phoneme would not have been marked with a rune different from the sowilō rune used for \"s\". The quality of the consonant can be conjectured, and the general opinion is that it was something between and , the Old Norse reflex of the sound. In Old Swedish, the phonemic distinction between \"r\" and \"ʀ\" was retained into the 11th century, as shown by the numerous runestones from Sweden from then.\n\nFrom 500 to 800, two great changes occurred within Proto-Norse. Umlauts appeared, which means that a vowel was influenced by the succeeding vowel or semivowel: Old Norse \"gestr\" (guest) came from P-N \"\" (guest). Another sound change is known as vowel breaking in which the vowel changed into a diphthong: \"hjarta\" from *\"hertō\" or \"fjǫrðr\" from \"*ferþuz\".\n\nUmlauts resulted in the appearance of the new vowels \"y\" (like \"fylla\" from *\"fullijaną\") and \"œ\" (like \"dœma\" from *\"dōmijaną\"). The umlauts are divided into three categories, A-umlaut, i-umlaut and u-umlaut; the last was still productive in Old Norse. The first, however, appeared very early, and its effect can be seen already around 500, on the Golden Horns of Gallehus. The variation caused by the umlauts was itself no great disruption in the language. It merely introduced new allophones of back vowels if certain vowels were in following syllables. However, the changes brought forth by syncope made the umlaut-vowels a distinctive non-transparent feature of the morphology and phonology, phonemicising what were previously allophones.\n\nSyncope shortened the long vowels of unstressed syllables; many shortened vowels were lost. Also, most short unstressed vowels were lost. As in P–N, the stress accent lay on the first syllable words as P–N *\"katilōz\" became ON \"katlar\" (cauldrons), P–N \"horną\" was changed into Old Norse \"horn\" and P–N \"\" resulted in ON \"gestr\" (guest). Some words underwent even more drastic changes, like *\"habukaz\" which changed into ON \"haukr\" (hawk).\n\n"}

Sharaf Beg Bedlisi (Kurdish: شەرەفخانی بەدلیسی, \"Şerefxanê Bedlîsî\"; ) (949-1012/1543-1603-04) was a medieval Kurdish emir and a politician from the Emirate of Bitlis.\n\nBut he is more known as a historian, writer and poet. He wrote exclusively in Persian. Born in the Garmrood village, in central Iran, between Arak and Qom, at a young age he was sent to the Safavid's court and obtained his education there.\n\nHe is the author of one of the most important works on medieval Kurdish history, written in 1597, Sharafnama. He created a good picture of Kurdish life and Kurdish dynasties in the 16th century in his works. Outside Iran and Kurdish-speaking countries, Sharaf Khan Bidlisi has influenced Kurdish literature and societies through the translation of his works by other scholars.\n\nHe was also a gifted artist, and a well-educated man excelling as much in mathematics and military strategy, as he did in history.\n\nSharaf Khan Bidlisi was born on February 25, 1543, in the Markazi province, Iran in the Garmrood village, during the exile of his father. The Rojaki dynasty, which had ruled intermittently as an independent emirate from their capital of Bitlis since at least the 9th century, and therefore, he never took up the common tribal title of \"Khan\", preferring instead the royal title of emir or mir, \"prince.\" He was most commonly known as, Mir Sharaf (Prince Sharaf). Later his family was taken under protection of the Safavid dynasty. He was schooled at Tahmasb's court, and wrote in 1596:\n\nBedlîsî speaks of his education entailing instruction in the Quran, readings in on the principles of the \"shari'a\", a piety and purity. Due to Shah Tahmasb's religious disposition, Bidlisi was introduced to religious scholars, who warned him against evil people, and instead encouraged friendship with the virtuous. And once Bidlisi attained maturity, he was thought the martial arts (sipahigira), archery, polo, racing, swordsmanship, and the precepts of chivalry – humanism and generosity.\n\nIn 1576 Tahmasb of the Safavids gives him the title the \"Mir\" of \"Mirs\"; appoints him leader of all Iranian Kurdish tribes. He accepts his title, but only two years later, \"Sharafkhan\" abandons his previous stand, and supports the Ottomans in their war against the Iranians, offering them 400 soldiers. Between 1578 and 1588, Sharafkhan virtually led all the Ottoman wars against the Persians. Sultan Murad III, the Ottoman Sultan, grants Sharafkhan the title of Khan. He becomes the \"Mir\" of the \"Batlisi province\". As he turned 53, Sharafkhan gave the authority of his dynasty to his son \"Shamsaddin Bag Abu Alma'ali\".\n\nHe was thinking for a long time to write a book about Kurdish history, and finally in 1597 Sharaf Khan Bidlisi started his composition of his epic, \"Sharafnama\".\n\nThe \"Sharafnama\" divides its history into four parts. The first one deals with the five Kurdish dynasties that have enjoyed status as royalty (\"Saltant\"): the Marwanids of Amed, the Hasanwayhids of Dinavar and Sharizur, the \"Fadluyids\" of the Great Lur, the princes of little Lur, and finally, Saladin the Great and the Ayyubids. The second part lists dynasties that have had coin struck and the \"khutba\" recited in their names. (The \"Khutba\" is a religious invacation pronounced at the Friday day prayers meeting that mentions the Prophet, the first four caliphs and the current rulers). The third part numbers the families of the hereditary governors, while the fourth details the history of the mirs of \"Bitilis\".\n\nHe wrote his works in Persian, and it was not until 1879 that it was translated into Kurdish (Kurmanji) by the Kurdish polymath Mahmud Bayazidi (1797–1859). Its hand-written version is preserved in the Russian National Library, and was published for the first time in 1986. In 1972, the Sorani version of \"Sharafnama\" was written for the first time by the late Kurdish scholar Abdurrahman Sharafkandi (1920–1991), also known as \"Mamosta Hajar\". In 1873–1875, the French scholar François Charmoy translated Sharafnama from Persian into French and published it in Saint Petersburg, in Russia. Among many other languages, Sharafname has been translated into Arabic, English, Turkic languages, Russian, Greek and Armenian.\n\nHe died in his own principality (Emirate of Bitlis) in 1603 at the age of 60, and left thousands of writings.\n\nBeing one of the oldest books ever written by a Kurd, the creation of \"Sharafnama\" is a turning point in the history of Kurds and their rich culture. The fact that a Kurd, for the first time, put Kurdish culture under a spotlight is of special importance in contrast to other studies that were done before \"Sharafnama\".\n\nBidlisi has a unique place in Kurdish history. After his \"Sharafnama\", a number of copies and other works similar in nature surfaced over the centuries within the cultural sphere on rich Kurdish history. In the text of the Sharafnama, the empires of the Kurds parallel those of the Arabs, Persians and Turks, some, according to Bitlisi, reaching back over 4,000 years. Sharaf khan's \"Sharafnama\" is today safely kept in Oxford.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19929523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19929523", "title": "Tlgadintsi", "text": "Tlgadintsi\n\nTlgadintsi or Tlkatintsi (), Hovhannes Harutiunian (, 1860, Tlkatin village, Kharpert, Western Armenia – 1915) was an Armenian writer and teacher noted for his leading role in rural literature. He is credited with giving the first authoritative response to a call from Constantinople's Armenian intelligentsia, issued in the early 1890s, for writing firmly rooted in the village life of historic Western Armenia. His unique realist works range from probing the darkest corners of village life to revisiting cherished moments of childhood. Through his esteem as a mentor and his power as a writer he opened the way for a new generation of important writers such as Rupen Zartarian, Peniamin Noorigian, Vahé Haig, Vahan Totovents, Hamasdegh, and others. \nHe was born in 1860 in the village of Tlgadin (present-day Kuyulu) ten miles south of Kharpert. His father was a farmer who died when Tlgandintsi was quite young, leaving him and his mother in poverty. Despite their misfortune his mother persevered and enrolled him in the parish school to begin his education. On finishing the parish school he continued his education at the Smpadian School in Kharpert, where his courses included classical Armenian, grammar, geography, and mathematics.\n\nBy 1878 he had completed his studies at the Smpadian School and embarked on his dual career as village schoolmaster and journalist, this in the immediate aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 which had left the Armenian populace of the Ottoman Empire in widespread misery. He found his first teaching position in the village of Chunkoush (Çüngüş), and he established himself as a writer with the reports he sent to the Constantinople newspapers \"Arevelk\" and \"Masis\" through the 1880s. In 1893, responding to the call of Constantinople's Armenian literati, he emerged as a distinctive new voice in fiction with the publication in the newspaper \"Hairenik\" of \"Emily\", a satirical sketch about an American missionary and her activities in an Armenian village. This work, the first he signed with the name \"Tlgadintsi\", was welcomed by the critics and enthusiastically received by the readers.\n\nTlgadintsi spent his whole life in the immediate environs of Kharpert. His stories focus exclusively on the psychology, values and interpersonal relationships of completely ordinary villagers. In an era when thousands of his compatriots were abandoning their homeland for America, he stood staunchly opposed to the wave of emigration. He also took a dim view of the famed revolutionary parties of his day and was never affiliated with any of them. At the same time, he was seriously concerned with the inroads that missionary Protestantism was making among Armenians, an issue at the core of \"Just One Glass\". \n\nIn 1884 Tlgadintsi was appointed director of his alma mater and left his teaching duties to settle in Kharpert. In 1887 he founded the Central National School in Kharpert and in 1888 became its director, a post which he held continuously, with one exception [see below], until his death in 1915. The school stood in Kharpert's Upper Quarter next to St. Hagop church and was commonly known as the Central School or \"Red College\" because its exterior was painted red. It was also simply designated with Tlgadintsi's name. Its advanced level included courses in Armenian secular and church history, classical and modern Armenian, grammar and composition, English, English literature, French, French literature, Turkish and Turkish composition, mathematics, music, and physics.\n\nIn 1895, at the height of the Hamidian massacres, the school was attacked by an anti-Armenian mob and totally burned to the ground. With the return of normalcy, Tlgadintsi and some colleagues managed to open a few classes in a building in the Lower Quarter of Kharpert, while work to rebuild the Central School at its original site was undertaken with the financial help of Kharpert educational associations in the United States. The move back to the original location took place in 1900. The rebuilt school continued to be called the \"Red College\" even though it was no longer painted red. \n\nIn 1903, in the course of a crackdown on Armenian militants, Tlgadintsi was arrested and thrown in jail for nine months as a supposed subversive, along with his leading disciple, Rupen Zartarian. Upon his release he was allowed to resume his post as director of the Central School.\n\nWhen Turkish forces arrived in Kharpert in 1915 to destroy its Armenian community, Tlgadintsi found temporary hiding in the house of a childhood Muslim friend of his to whom he entrusted his large collection of unpublished works for safekeeping. Quite notably, the collection included his accounts of the infamous massacres of 1895. One day he was completely devastated to learn that in a moment of panic his friend had set fire to the entire collection and reduced it to ash. Shortly afterward, Tlgadintsi was found out and thrown into a jail crowded with other Armenian notables. At this point he learned that his wife, six daughters, and son had already been sent to their deaths on the deportation routes. Nevertheless, under those grim circumstances he still managed to show a few flashes of his characteristic wit to lift the spirits of his fellow prisoners. \n\nOn June 20th 1915, he was murdered in a gorge near his birthplace in the course of the Armenian Genocide.\n\n\n"}
