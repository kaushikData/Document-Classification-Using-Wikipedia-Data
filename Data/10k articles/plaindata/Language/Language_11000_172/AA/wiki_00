The research in these hypothetical languages is variously called exolinguistics, xenolinguistics or astrolinguistics. The question of what form alien languages might take and the possibility for humans to recognize and translate them has been part of the linguistics and language studies courses, e.g., at the Bowling Green State University (2001).\n\nNoam Chomsky (1983), basing on his theory of the existence of a genetically-predetermined universal grammar of human languages, holds that it would be impossible for a human to naturally learn an alien language because it would most probably violate the universal grammar inborn in humans. Humans would have to study an alien language by the slow way of discovery, the same way as scientists do research in, say, physics.\n\nLinguist Keren Rice posits that basic communication between humans and aliens should be possible, unless \"the things that we think are common to languages—situating in time [and] space, talking about participants, etc.—are so radically different that the human language provides no starting point for it.\"\n\nMcGill University Linguistics Professor, Jessica Coon was consulted for the linguistic aspect of the 2016 film \"Arrival\".

It is a valuable tool to identify and document past owners of a property and serves as a property’s historical ownership timeline. The \"chain\" runs from the present owner back to the original owner of the property. In situations where documentation of ownership is important, it is often necessary to reconstruct the chain of title. To facilitate this, a record of title documents may be maintained by a registry office or civil law notary.\n\nReal estate is one field where the chain of title has considerable significance. Various registration systems, such as the Torrens title system, have been developed to track the ownership of individual pieces of real property. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue title insurance based upon the chain of title to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records. In other cases, the chain of title is established by an abstract of title, sometimes, although not always, certified by an attorney. In the United States, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish chain of title, despite the fact that clear chain of title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed. Widespread lack of clarity in chain of title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments. US states have objected and even sued over this practice.\n\nIn the motion picture industry, the chain of title involves the series of documentation which establishes proprietary rights in a film. The chain also applies to compilations in other fields, where many people have contributed to the project, thus acquiring authorship rights, or where materials were culled from many sources. Chain of title is extremely important to film purchasers and to film distributors, as it establishes the veracity of the owner's proprietary rights (or rights under license) in the intellectual property in a film, book or encyclopedia.\n\nChain of title documentation can include:\n\n\nSpecialist organizations engage in the production of copyright property reports for motion picture studios, which cover original or unexploited works, and include the results of United States Copyright Office screening searches, author claimant searches, registration renewal searches and assignment searches.

{"id": "17554380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17554380", "title": "Chinese ritual bronzes", "text": "Chinese ritual bronzes\n\nSets of ritual bronzes (in chinese: 中国青铜器) are the most impressive surviving objects from the Chinese Bronze Age. During the Shang dynasty, China became one of the most skilled bronze-working civilizations in the ancient world, as people heated, melted, and cast metal to making cooking utensils, tools, weapons, and other household items. Modern archaeologists see such preservation of how the ancient Chinese lived by interpreting from lacquer paintings on wood which helped preserve ancient Chinese bronze artifacts. Being from around 1650 BCE, these elaborately decorated vessels were deposited as grave goods in the tombs of royalty and the nobility, and were evidently produced in very large numbers, with documented excavations finding over 200 pieces in a single royal tomb. They were produced for an individual to use in ritual offerings of food and drink to his ancestors in family temples or ceremonial halls over tombs, or rather ritual banquets in which both living and dead members of a family participated; early literary records speak of these. On the death of the owner they would be placed in his tomb, so that he could continue to pay his respects in the afterlife; other examples were cast specifically as grave goods. The zoomorphic motives are similar with the art of the karasuk culture.\n\nThe ritual bronzes were probably not used for normal eating and drinking; they represent larger, more elaborate versions of the types of vessels used for this, and made in precious materials. Apart from table vessels, weapons and some other objects were made in special ritual forms. Another class of ritual objects are those, also including weapons, made in jade, which was probably the most highly valued of all, and which had been long used for ritual tools and weapons, since about 4,500 BCE. \n\nAt least initially, the production of bronze was probably controlled by the ruler, who gave unformed metal to his nobility as a sign of favour.\n\nThey contain between 5% and 30% tin and between 2% and 3% lead.\n\nBronzes () are some of the most important pieces of ancient Chinese art, warranting an entire separate catalogue in the Imperial art collections. The Chinese Bronze Age began in the Xia Dynasty (ca. 2070 – ca. 1600 BC), and bronze ritual containers form the bulk of collections of Chinese antiquities, reaching its zenith during the Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BC) and the early part of the Zhou Dynasty (1045–256 BC).\n\nThe majority of surviving Chinese ancient bronze artefacts are ritual forms rather than their equivalents made for practical use, either as tools or weapons. Weapons like daggers and axes had a sacrificial meaning, symbolizing the heavenly power of the ruler. The strong religious associations of bronze objects brought up a great number of vessel types and shapes which became regarded as classic and totemic and were copied, often in other media such as Chinese porcelain, throughout subsequent periods of Chinese art.\n\nThe ritual books of old China minutely describe who was allowed to use what kinds of sacrificial vessels and how much. The king of Zhou used 9 dings and 8 gui vessels, a duke was allowed to use 7 dings and 6 guis, a baron could use 5 dings and 3 guis, a nobleman was allowed to use 3 dings and 2 guis. Turning to actual archaeological finds, the tomb of Fu Hao, an unusually powerful Shang queen, contained her set of ritual vessels, numbering over two hundred, which are also far larger than the twenty-four vessels in the tomb of a contemporary nobleman. Her higher status would have been clear not only to her contemporaries, but also, it was believed, to her ancestors and other spirits. Many of the pieces were cast with inscriptions using the posthumous form of her name, indicating there were made especially for burial in the tomb.\n\nThe origin of the ores or metals use for Shang and other early chinese bronze is a current (2018) topic of research. As with other early civilisations (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Indus) the Shang period development was centered on river valleys, and driven in part by the introduction of intensive agriculture - in China such areas lacked ore deposits and required the import of metallurgical material. Typical Shang period bronzes contain over 2% lead, unlike contemporary coppers of the Eurasian Steppe. Analysis of the ore/metals origins has been based on lead content and trace isotope analysis. In the case of Shang period bronzes, various sites, from early to late Shang period, numerous samples of the bronze alloy are characterized by high radiogenic Lead isotope content (derived from both uranium and thorium decay), unlike most known native Chinese lead ores. Potential speculative sources of the ore include Qinling, middle to lower Yangtze area, and south-west china; the possibility that ore or metal was imported from Africa in this period has been proposed, based on potential isotopic matches, but challenged and rejected by other researchers. Pre-Shang (Erlitou culture) bronzes do not contain the radiogenic lead isotopes.\n\nThe appreciation, creation and collection of Chinese bronzes as pieces of art and not as ritual items began in the Song dynasty and reached its zenith in the Qing dynasty during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, whose massive collection is recorded in the catalogues known as the \"Xiqing gujian\" (西清古鑑) and the \"Xiqing jijian\" (西清繼鑑). Within those two catalogues, the bronzeware is categorized according to use:\n\nThe most highly prized are generally the sacrificial and wine vessels, which form the majority of most collections. Often these vessels are elaborately decorated with \"taotie\" designs.\n\n\n Museum of Art]].]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This diversity is partly to be explained in terms of areal influences from Chinese on the one hand and Indo-Aryan languages on the other. Matisoff proposed two large and overlapping areas combining cultural and linguistic features – the \"Sinosphere\" and the \"Indosphere\", influenced by China and India respectively. A buffer zone between them as a third group was proposed by Kristine A. Hildebrandt, followed by B. Bickel and J. Nichols.

For example, the Munda and Khasi branches of Austroasiatic languages, the Tibeto-Burman languages of Eastern Nepal, and much of the \"Kamarupan\" group of Tibeto-Burman, which most notably includes the Meitei (Manipuri), are Indospheric; while the Hmong–Mien family, the Kam–Sui branch of Kadai, the Loloish branch of Tibeto-Burman, and Vietnamese (Viet–Muong) are Sinospheric. Some other languages, like Thai and Tibetan, have been influenced by both Chinese and Indian culture at different historical periods. Still other linguistic communities are so remote geographically that they have escaped significant influence from either. For example, the Aslian branch of Mon–Khmer in Malaya, or the Nicobarese branch of Mon–Khmer in the Nicobar Islands of the Indian Ocean show little influence by Sinosphere or Indosphere. The Bodish languages and Kham languages are characterized by hybrid prosodic properties akin to related Indospheric languages towards the west and also Sinospheric languages towards the east. Some languages of the Kiranti group in the Indosphere rank among the morphologically most complex languages of Asia.\n\nIndian cultural, intellectual, and political influence – especially that of Pallava writing system – began to penetrate both insular and peninsular Southeast Asia about 2000 years ago. Indic writing systems were adopted first by Austronesians, like Javanese and Cham, and Austroasiatics, like Khmer and Mon, then by Tai (Siamese and Lao) and Tibeto-Burmans (Pyu, Burmese, and Karen). Indospheric languages are also found in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), defined as the region encompassing Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, as well as parts of Burma, Peninsular Malaysia and Vietnam. Related scripts are also found in South East Asian islands ranging from Sumatra, Java, Bali, south Sulawesi and most of the Philippines. The learned components of the vocabularies of Khmer, Mon, Burmese and Thai/Lao consist of words of Pali or Sanskrit origin. Indian influence also spread north to the Himalayan region. Tibetan has used Devanagari writing since 600 AD, but has preferred to calque new religious and technical vocabulary from native morphemes rather than borrowing Indian ones. The Cham empires, known collectively as Champa, which were founded around the end of 2nd century AD, belonged directly to Indosphere of influence, rather than to the Sinosphere which shaped so much of Vietnamese culture and by which Chams were influenced later and indirectly.\n\nLanguages in the \"Sinosphere\" (roughly Southeast Asia) tend to be analytic, with little morphology, monosyllabic or sesquisyllabic lexical structures, extensive compounding, complex tonal systems, and serial verb constructions. Languages in the \"Indosphere\" (roughly the Himalayas and South Asia) tend to be more agglutinative, with polysyllabic structures, extensive case and verb morphology, and detailed markings of interpropositional relationships. Manange (like other Tamangic languages) is an interesting case to examine in this regard, as geographically it fits squarely in the \"Indospheric\" Himalayas, but typologically it shares more features with the \"Sinospheric\" languages. Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in the Sinosphere tend to be more isolating, while those spoken in the Indosphere tend to be more morphologically complex.\n\nMany languages in the western side of the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes the Tibeto-Burman languages, show significant typological resemblances with other languages of the South Asia, which puts them in the group of Indosphere. They often have heavier syllables than found in the east, while tone systems, though attested, are not as frequent. Indospheric languages are often toneless and/or highly suffixal. Often there is considerable inflectional morphology, from fully developed case marking systems to extensive pronominal morphology found on the verb. These languages generally mark a number of types of inter-casual relationships and have distinct construction involving verbal auxiliaries. Languages of the Indosphere typically display retroflex stop consonants, postsentential relative clauses and the extended grammaticalization of the verb \"say\". In Indospheric languages, such as the Tibeto-Burman languages of Northeast India and Nepal, for example, the development of relative pronouns and correlative structures as well as of retroflex initial consonants is often found.\n\n\n\n"}

Along with the Tuu languages and Khoe languages, they are one of three language families indigenous to southern Africa, which are typologically similar due to areal effects.\n\n\nǂ’Amkoe had previously been lumped in with the Tuu languages, perhaps over confusion with the dialect name ǂHȍȁn, but the only thing they have in common are typological features such as their bilabial clicks. \n\nHonken & Heine (2010) coined the term \"Kx'a\" for the family as a replacement for the rather inaccessible compound \"Ju–ǂHoan\" (easily confused with the Juǀʼhoan language), after the word 'earth, ground', which is shared by the two branches of the family, though also by neighboring languages such as Kwadi.\n\nHonken & Heine (2010) reconstruct six click families for Kx'a: the five that occur in the most conservative dialects of ǃKung, plus the bilabial clicks of ǂHoan. Bilabial clicks became dental in ǃXun; retroflex clicks became lateral in ǂHoan and northern ǃXun, alveolar in southern ǃXun, and remained retroflex only in central ǃXun. However, Starostin (2003) argues that the bilabial clicks are a secondary development in .

{"id": "2448205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2448205", "title": "Language border", "text": "Language border\n\nA language border or language boundary is the line separating two language areas. The term is generally meant to imply a lack of mutual intelligibility between the two languages. If two adjacent languages or dialects are mutually intelligible, no firm border will develop, because the two languages can continually exchange linguistic inventions; this is known as a dialect continuum. A \"language island\" is a language area that is completely surrounded by a language border.\n\nThe concept of mutual intelligibility is vague. More important, the ability to distinguish languages from one another can also be difficult, since some languages share writing systems but are spoken differently and some are identical when spoken but are written using different alphabets. There are often also shared terms between two languages even between languages that have nothing to do with each other.\n\nFor example, Spanish is spoken in most Central American and South American countries, but also in Spain. There are subtle but recognizable differences between the dialects, but there are different dialects even within the country of Spain. In many cultures there are still subtle differences between the terminology (called the register) used when talking to your boss and talking to your mother or talking to your friends. So where are the language borders?\n\nThere can also be people within a country who speak the \"native\" language of a different country, some of whom may be bilingual. Also, an inherited language may evolve and perhaps absorb some of the characteristics or terms of the new area's predominant language. In cases such as these, it becomes even more difficult to identify specific languages. \n\nWhen speakers have a foreign accent, they are often perceived to be less intelligent and are less likely to be hired. It is the same with an accent from a peripheral area, rather than the accent from the urbanized core: a peripheral person is typically perceived as speaking a \"less correct\" by those who are more educated, while those who are not as educated do not perceive any difference in the \"correctness\". Colonial histories could also help this phenomenon.\n\nA well-known example of a language border is the border between Romance languages and Germanic languages that stretches through Belgium, France, Switzerland, and Italy.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that language borders do not always reflect political borders; the tendency to correlate language with ethnicity is a common error that seems to have its basis during the period of 19th century European expansion (e.g., the term \"Anglo\" in Mexico and the southeastern U.S., or the term \"Angrez\" – literally, \"English\" – in North India). The usage of a particular language can reflect positively or negatively on its speaker depending upon the situation. For example, there is perception that only English speakers are American and only non-Americans are non-English-speakers. It is suspected that this assumption began because states would have \"official\" languages for the purposes of book publishing and therefore for the purposes of education, so intelligence would come to be associated with speaking the language that was written.\nBecause of this idea, there are also often social benefits which result from being able to speak English. A prime example of this is the prevalence of bilingualism near the U.S.–Mexican border, which also indicates the porosity of the border and illustrates the difficulty of drawing a \"border\" around all speakers of a given language, especially because there is not usually much correlation between ethnicity and language. Such common bilingualism leads to the practice of code-switching, or the changing freely between languages while speaking although this trait is somewhat looked down upon because those living in areas of frequent code-switching seem to develop a sort of language loyalty.\n\nAnother example of the difference between language borders and political borders is the spread of languages via colonialism, causing languages to be spoken in multiple, not necessarily adjacent countries.\n\nAlthough language borders and political borders do not always agree, there have been instances where political leadership has attempted to enforce language borders. One instance of this is the passing of Bill 101 in Quebec, Canada, which declared French to be the only official language of the area. Another similar example is that of Ciudad Juarez on the American–Mexican border, where social efforts have been made to curb the amount of American influence taking place—but at the same time, as in other foreign cultures, the class benefits of English proficiency are acknowledged and to this end schools teach in English and many television channels are in English. There are also instances of intolerance to the speaking of Native American languages at some schools, thus forcing those students to create small communities in which they can speak their native language, thereby creating \"language boundaries\" on a very small scale. Examples like these illustrate the impact that language boundaries can have on cultural boundaries, even if they are not necessarily one and the same.\n\n"}
{"id": "1211198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1211198", "title": "Manager (professional wrestling)", "text": "Manager (professional wrestling)\n\nIn professional wrestling, a manager is a supporting character paired with a wrestler (or wrestlers) for a variety of reasons. A physically attractive woman accompanying, or \"seconding\", a male wrestler to a match is sometimes referred to as a valet.\n\nPerformers who assume this role may be non-wrestlers, occasional wrestlers, older wrestlers who have retired or are nearing retirement, or new wrestlers who are breaking into the business (or a specific company) and need experience in front of the crowds. The wrestler who is paired with a manager may be referred to as his or her charge, client, or ward. A professional wrestling manager has nothing to do with their real-world counterpart or with a promotion's road agent. \n\nManagers are somewhat like storyline agents for an actor or an athlete; they help their client to book matches and appearances, and otherwise work to further and guide their career. Within the context of storylines, the manager positions their client for title opportunities, generally acts as a mouthpiece on their behalf, decides whom to trust as an ally, or even just acting as an exposed Achilles' heel to be exploited by their client's opponents. Managers could be utilized by a promotion's booker to instigate and strengthen storylines; their involvement could form the center of a controversy, for instance if they double-cross their clients or inadvertably cause the loss or forfeiture of their clients' championship titles. \n\nOutside of storylines, a manager's job is to help the wrestler they're paired with get over. The manager would cut promos on behalf of clients who may not be as charismatic (or had gimmicks depicting them as silent, or with limited ability to speak English). As such, successful managers almost invariably had the \"gift of the gab\", though it wasn't unheard of to see managers paired with wrestlers who had no trouble cutting their own promos. A notable example of this would be CM Punk, who was managed by Paul Heyman from 2012 to 2013. Punk had no trouble cutting his own promos, but Heyman would also cut his own promos alongside Punk in support of his client's act.\n\nWhile the basic goal of a manager to give his or her wrestlers a push does not change, the tactics depend on several factors, especially alignment. Managers, when used judiciously, are capable of completely change the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match. A heel manager, for example, may instruct their clients to constantly duck tougher opponents or interfere in their matches to secure a win by cheating. A face manager, on the other hand, may spend the majority of their interview time talking about how tough their client is and going out of their way to find bigger and better opponents to challenge, or rally the audience to chant and cheer in support of their client during matches. Often the very act of aligning with a manager, or conversely breaking away from a manager they've worked with, can change a wrestler's alignment, making them a sudden fan favorite or heel.\n\nCertain wrestlers employ a specific kind of manager known as a \"handler.\" If a wrestler's character calls for it, a handler is the only person who can manage the behaviour of a \"wild\" wrestler's who is prone to \"go out of control\". A classic example of this was The Undertaker, who in his early Deadman persona could only be controlled by Paul Bearer, through an urn which was said to have all of the Undertaker's powers. A legitimate example is Arnold Skaaland, who not only managed Andre The Giant for a time but was once assigned by promoter Vince McMahon Sr. as his real life handler. Skaaland was responsible for keeping Andre, known for his alcoholism, out of serious trouble and to ensure that he would reach a venue in time to wrestle a scheduled match. \n\nA few managers, like Paul Ellering, are legitimate managers in the truest sense of the word, taking care of the day-to-day needs of their clients by dealing with travel arrangements, rentals, lodgings and even contractual negotiations. Others, such as Jim Cornette or Gary Hart, participate as real-life bookers and/or road agents for their promotions behind the scenes while performing concurrently as managers.\n\nIn the early years of pro wrestling, the vast majority of professional wrestling managers were men, and female managers were rare. A number of prominent women like Miss Elizabeth, Sherri Martel and Woman made their debuts during the 1980s professional wrestling boom and went on to have storied careers in several wrestling promotions as wrestling managers. \n\nUp until the mid-1990s, managers were very common because they served a secondary purpose: \"getting heat.\" During the territorial era, most managers did not travel from territory to territory, but instead remained in one territory to provide instant heat to the promotion's new heel acts. Notable examples include \"The Mouth of The South\" Jimmy Hart in Memphis, Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan in the American Wrestling Association, and the \"Three Wise Men\" (Lou Albano, Freddie Blassie, and The Grand Wizard) in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (now the WWE).\n\nBy the 2000's, major promotions like the WWE have favoured elevating the careers of wrestlers who are able to speak for themselves. As a result, the previously ubiquitous role of a manager has declined in favor of either female valets who occasionally get involved in wrestling matches, or by people who hold on-screen power as General Managers, Commissioners or various corporate officer positions. However, contemporary wrestling personalities such as Paul Heyman and Vickie Guerrero have demonstrated that managers are still effective at drawing heat, and when used judiciously, are capable of changing the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match by contributing drama and tension.\n\nAlthough managers and valets are terms used interchangeably for a woman who accompanies a wrestler to the ring, a major point of difference is that the former is usually depicted as a professional spokesperson who crafts and/or guides a wrestler's career, while the latter may serve as little more than eye candy and/or as a distraction to opposing wrestlers or referees with their sex appeal. \n\nThe role of a valet is a significant part of professional wrestling history, at least within the context of North American industry. Historically, North American women wrestlers often received less attention or recognition compared to their male counterparts and often did not enjoy the same exposure compared to their Japanese or Mexican counterparts. As a result, the purpose of a valet role is to provide female talent more opportunities as well as visibility within the industry. It is thought that a valet, by virtue of her presence and/or the dynamics of her relationship with her associated wrestler, could contribute an element that amplifies their personas and get their act over. Many valets are not required to cut promos on their associated wrestler's behalf and generally have rather passive roles, since their physical appearance tend to be emphasized at the exclusion of all other traits; other valets may deviate from convention and assert a dominant role over their wrestlers, if their characters call for it.\n\nIn spite of their limited wrestling ability, perceived or otherwise, valets are more likely to participate in the occasional wrestling match in comparison to managers, and are frequently booked in mixed tag team matches against rival valets and their associated wrestlers as part of storyline angles. There are also numerous examples of female performers in the wrestling industry who started off as valets and went on to be recognized as marquee competitors in their own right, such as Lita, Trish Stratus, and The Fabulous Moolah. \n\nMale supporting characters who fit the original definition of a valet are uncommon in professional wrestling; a recent example was Ricardo Rodriguez, who performed as Alberto Del Rio's on-screen attendant and personal ring announcer during his tenure in the WWE. A male performer who accompanies a prominent female wrestler to the ring could be considered a valet as well, though this is exceptionally rare.\n\nWhile they are not managers in the traditional sense, enforcers — full-time wrestlers who accompany another wrestler to the ring — also serve both in and out of storylines to further the interests of a wrestler in their care. Larger but less charismatic wrestlers are conventionally booked in the role of an enforcer; this is done so that these wrestlers can get over with the crowd by sharing the charisma of the wrestler they accompany. A wrestler can also be the enforcer for an entire stable, traditionally serving as the biggest and strongest individual in the group (if not the entire promotion). In this scenario, the enforcer is utilized to \"protect\" the leader of the faction, and is often relegated to tag team matches to help them get over with the fans. Enforcers appear in storylines where wrestlers need to have their back watched by keeping outside interference from taking place in a match, to serve as outside interference themselves, or to further a storyline without actually recording a real match by defending their associates from ambushes outside the ring by other wrestlers. The Acolytes Protection Agency (APA) had a unique gimmick where instead of a long term association with one wrestler, tag team or stable, they would be hired by different wrestlers each week to act as their bodyguards or to prevent outside interference.\n\nPerhaps the best-known example in professional wrestling history is Arn Anderson, whose career has been highlighted by his association with Ric Flair and various members of The Four Horsemen stable as \"The Enforcer\". \n\n"}

She had two brothers, Yosef and Shmuel, and a sister, Devorah; both the daughters and the sons of the family attended the local Jewish school, where they learned to read and write Hebrew; although she did not attend cheder – the traditional elementary school where young boys studied the chumash (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) – her father hired a private tutor so that she could pursue her desire to study scripture.\n\nIn 1851, at the age of 12, she moved with her family to Suvalk (today, Suwałki, Poland), in the part of the empire known as Congress Poland, where she continued her Hebrew studies under the Hebraist Judah Loeb Paradiesthal. During her two and a half years of study under Paradiesthal he also instructed her in German and, to a lesser extent, French languages and literatures. When he left to take a position as a tutor in Warsaw, Markel-Mosessohn continued her Hebrew studies independently, shifting her focus from formal study of the language to intensive reading of whatever Hebrew works she could obtain; in this way she absorbed the products of the Jewish cultural revival then under way.\n\nDuring the 1860s she began focusing her efforts on translation of works into Hebrew, and completed a Hebrew version of Ludwig Philippson's German-language historical novella \"Der Flüchtling aus Jerusalem\" (in manuscript).\n\nShe married Anshel Markel-Mosessohn (1844–1903), of Kovno (Kaunas, Lithuania), in 1863, when she was 24 and he 19. She and her husband corresponded in Hebrew and shared an interest in the Hebrew revival; he was supportive of her writing, as well as of her efforts to publish her work. She assisted him in his business dealings at points. The two remained married for forty years, until Anshel Markel-Mosessohn's death, in 1903; they never had children.\n\nIn 1869 she published the first volume of \"Ha-Yehudim be-Angliya\", her elegant Hebrew translation of 's \"Die Juden und die Kreuzfahrer unter Richard Löwenherz\", a historical work about the Jews in England in the era of the crusades, under Richard I ('the Lionheart'). The second volume was not published until 1895 (both volumes appeared in Warsaw). Poor health and financial problems were at least partially the cause for the long delay in her bringing the second volume to completion.\n\nOver the course of her life Markel-Mosessohn corresponded with three prominent \"maskilim\" – her male colleagues in the Hebrew revival – Abraham Mapu, Judah Leib Gordon, and Moses Lilienblum. Mapu was the first fellow Hebrew writer with whom she initiated a correspondence, in 1861, writing to him in Hebrew and enclosing an original piece of writing. He responded appreciatively, complimenting the lucidity of her style and dubbing her a \"maskelet\", or enlightened woman. They exchanged a handful of letters over the next year or two, and also met briefly in person on two occasions, in 1861, and again in 1866 or 1867, both times at Mapu's home in Kovno.\n\nMarkel-Mosessohn wrote to Judah Leib Gordon for the first time in 1868, after she had completed a draft of the first part of \"Ha-Yehudim be-Angliya\", her translation of Francolm's work. Gordon responded enthusiastically to the translation; he assisted her in finding a publisher, and contributed a laudatory preface to the published volume. Their correspondence spanned 20 years, and reflected a mutually supportive friendship, although they never met in person.\n\nIn 1875 Gordon dedicated to her his poem \"Kotzo shel yud\" (The tip of the [letter] yud), which evokes empathy for a modern-day woman trapped by oppressive strictures of Jewish law. Two years later she acknowledged the honor, while writing to him for moral support, at a time when her husband had been imprisoned in connection with questionable financial dealings.\n\nDuring the 1870s Markel-Mosessohn became more involved than before in her husband's business affairs, and moved several times, at one point staying three years \nin Danzig (Gdańsk, Poland), and finally settling in Vienna in 1881.\n\nShe renewed her correspondence with Gordon in 1887, when she had completed the second volume of her Hebrew translation of Francolm's \"Die Juden und die Kreuzfahrer unter Richard Löwenherz\"; she requested he write a few lines for the preface of her book, and he readily complied, as pleased with the second as he had been with the first volume.\n\nIn the spring of 1887, upon Gordon's urging, Markel-Mosessohn hesitantly agreed to become the Viennese correspondent for the Hebrew newspaper \"Ha-Melitz\" (The advocate), of which he was then editor. Between May and July 1887 she published four progressively more developed articles, the last two being, respectively, a report detailing the appearance of political anti-Semitism during the latest Hungarian elections in the village of Tiszaeszlár, where a blood libel had occurred five years before, in 1892; and a feuilleton about summer in Vienna, and Viennese Jewry more generally.\n\n The sources cited by Waldstein/Rosenthal were: Kayserling, [Meyer], \"Die Jüdischen Frauen\", Leipzig, 1879, p. 311; and Zeitlin, [William], \"Bibliotheca post-Mendelssohniana\", [Leipzig, 1871/1895], p. 231.\n"}

The Eighth Schedule lists languages that the Government of India has the responsibility to develop.\n\nThe Eighth Schedule to the Constitution originally included 14 languages. Sindhi was included by the 21st Amendment, enacted in 1967; and Konkani, Meitei and Nepali were included by the 71st Amendment in 1992, raising the total number of languages to 18.\n\nThe \"Constitution (Ninety-second Amendment) Act, 2003\", was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 18 August 2003, as the \"Constitution (One-hundredth Amendment) Bill, 2003\" (Bill No. 63 of 2003). It was introduced by then Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani and sought to amend the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. The full text of the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the bill is given below:\n\nThe bill, as introduced, was referred to the Standing Committee on Home Affairs, which presented its report to the Rajya Sabha, recommending that the Bill be passed in the present form. The Report was laid on the table of the Lok Sabha on 5 December 2003. The Bill was debated by the Lok Sabha on 22 December 2003 and passed on the same day, with a formal amendment changing the short title from \"One-hundredth\" to \"Ninety-second\". During the consideration of the Bill in the House, an amendment was moved by L.K. Advani to include three other languages, namely, Santhali, Maithili and Dogri in the Eighth Schedule. The amendment was adopted by the House, and a newly substituted section 2 provided for inclusion of Bodo as Entry No. 3, Dogri as Entry No. 4, Maithili as Entry No. 10, Santhali as Entry No. 18 and also for consequential re-numbering of the existing entries, accordingly. The Bill, as passed by the Lok Sabha, was considered and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 23 December 2003. \n\nSpeaking in the Lok Sabha on 22 December, Advani stated that the constitutional amendment to include Bodo was \"in pursuance of a very valuable Memorandum of Settlement arrived at between the representatives of the Bodo community, the Government of Assam and the Government of India\". A part of the settlement was that the Government of India would consider inclusion of Bodo language in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. Janeshwar Mishra, Samajwadi Party Rajya Sabha MP, stated that no Indian language could flourish as long as the recognition given to English remained. Reacting to the demand for substituting English with any other Indian language, Advani stated that it was necessary that both English and Hindi co-exist for the unity of the country, stating, \"National unity is more important than language issue.\" He further stated that de-linking from English was not a good thing, as he felt that knowledge of English gave India an advantage over China in the Information Technology sector. Laxmi Mall Singhvi, BJP Rajya Sabha MP, stated that the legislation's intention was not to reduce the impact or acceptability of Hindi by including more languages in the Eighth Schedule.\n\nCongress member Pranab Mukherjee, stated that while he had no objection to any language being included in the Eighth Schedule, the Government should have consulted the Standing Committee to bring \"a comprehensive and well thought-out legislation\". He further added that, \"piecemeal legislations as this would only create rift in the country\". CPI(M) member Chandrakala Pandey named more than a dozen languages that she believed should be included in the Eighth Schedule. SP member Rama Shankar Kaushik felt that the Government needed to differentiate between \"Bhasaha aur Boli\" (language and dialect), stating, \"If you cease to differentiate between language and dialect, you will end up reducing the status of Hindi as the official language and that will create tension on the basis of language.\" RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav felt that inclusion of a language or dialect in the Eighth Schedule should be done carefully and comprehensively to ensure that there was no dispute on the language medium of examinations, finding teachers, and programmes on radio and television.\n\nDMK member S. Viduthalai Virumbi stated that Hindi was not a \"majority language\", and demanded that the official language of a State be included as official language of the country. Verumbi was interrupted by SP member Amar Singh, who objected to opposition to Hindi, saying, \"I respect Tamil but to oppose Hindi is not correct.\"\n\nThe bill received assent from then President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam on 7 January 2004, and came into force on the same date. It was notified in \"The Gazette of India\" on 8 January 2004.\n\nAdivasi youths celebrated the passage of the 92nd Amendment by bursting crackers and distributing sweets at various tribal-dominated areas such as Karandih, Parsudih, Kadma and Birsanagar.\n\nBJP Lok Sabha MP from Mayurbhanj, Odisha, Salkhan Murmu termed the day that the bill passed as historic for tribal people. Murmu further expressed that the long-cherished dreams of the tribals had been fulfilled, saying, \"This is the first time that the Adivasis have got recognition\". Murmu had tabled the proposal for the inclusion of the Santhali language in the Eighth Schedule in the Lok Sabha.

{"id": "3801006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3801006", "title": "Ojibwe grammar", "text": "Ojibwe grammar\n\nThe Ojibwe language is an Algonquian American Indian language spoken throughout the Great Lakes region and westward onto the northern plains. It is one of the largest American Indian languages north of Mexico in terms of number of speakers, and exhibits a large number of divergent dialects. For the most part, this article describes the Minnesota variety of the Southwestern dialect. The orthography used is the Fiero Double-Vowel System.\n\nLike many American languages, Ojibwe is polysynthetic, meaning it exhibits a great deal of synthesis and a very high morpheme-to-word ratio (e.g., the single word for \"they are Chinese\" is \"aniibiishaabookewininiiwiwag\", which contains seven morphemes: elm--liquid-make-man-be-, or approximately \"they are leaf-soup [i.e., tea] makers\"). It is agglutinating, and thus builds up words by stringing morpheme after morpheme together, rather than having several affixes which carry numerous different pieces of information.\n\nLike most Algonquian languages, Ojibwe distinguishes two different kinds of third person, a \"proximate\" and an \"obviative\". The proximate is a traditional third person, while the obviative (also frequently called \"fourth person\") marks a less important third person if more than one third person is taking part in an action. In other words, Ojibwe uses the obviative to avoid the confusion that could be created by English sentences such as \"John and Bill were good friends, ever since the day he first saw him\" (who saw whom?). In Ojibwe, one of the two participants would be marked as proximate (whichever one was deemed more important), and the other marked as obviative.\n\nRather than a gender contrast such as masculine/feminine, Ojibwe instead distinguishes between animate and inanimate. Animate nouns are generally living things, and inanimate ones generally nonliving things, although that is not a simple rule because of the cultural understanding as to whether a noun possesses a \"spirit\" or not (generally, if it can move, it possesses a \"spirit\"). Objects with great spiritual importance for the Ojibwe, such as rocks, are very often animate rather than inanimate, for example. Some words are distinguished purely by their noun class; for example, \"mitig\", if it is animate (plural \"mitigoog\"), means \"tree;\" if it is inanimate (plural \"mitigoon\"), it means \"stick.\"\n\nNumber in Ojibwe is a simple singular/plural contrast. Nouns and pronouns can be either singular or plural, and verbs inflect for the number of their subject and object, although some nouns and verbs lack singular forms. Plural forms differ from word to word depending on the word's gender, root, and historical stress. By examining the plural form of the word, one can generally determine the word's gender and root. Animate plurals end in \"-g\", while inanimate plural nouns (and obviative nouns) end in \"-n\". The underlying form of a root determines the \"linking vowel\" — the vowel that appears before the plural suffix (\"-g\" or \"-n\") but after the root itself.\n\nThere are seven Ojibwe inflectional categories expressing person/gender combinations for each of the two numbers (singular and plural). However, the singular and plural categories do not always exactly correspond. The total number of 14 \"persons\" arises from taking into consideration all the contrasts of animate/inanimate, proximate/obviative, and singular/plural.\n\nAnimate gender (singular)\nAnimate gender (plural)\nInanimate gender\nCharacteristics of the resulting 14 persons are built into Ojibwe nouns and pronouns, thus dictating which verb forms would be used in speech. In nouns and verbs, all 14 forms of persons may or may not present themselves, as words are divided as either animate or inanimate genders and very few words exist as both, but all 14 forms of persons generally do appear with pronouns.\n\nOjibwe pronouns, along with distinguishing singular and plural number and first, second, third, and fourth (obviative) persons, also carry a distinction between inclusive and exclusive first person plural. Pronouns may present themselves either as independent words or as series of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAn \"inclusive\" first person plural indicates that the pronoun includes the addressee, i.e., \"we including you\" (\"giinawind\"). An \"exclusive\" first person plural indicates that the addressee is not included, i.e., \"we excluding you\" (\"niinawind\").\n\nThe other personal pronouns are the first singular \"niin\", second singular \"giin\", third singular \"wiin\", second plural \"giinawaa\", and third plural \"wiinawaa\".\n\nLike the independent words, Ojibwe pronominal prefixes indicate first person with \"n-\", second person with \"g-\" and third person with \"w-\". However, the associated suffixes for these persons will be different depending on if the word is a verb or a noun.\nIn many Ojibwe-speaking communities, the first person prefix is used without the initial \"n\". Due to vowel syncope in some communities, those prefixes are further reduced without the initial \"i\". However, among Saulteaux communities, the first person prefix \"nim-\" and \"nin-\" are instead reduced to \"ni-\", \"nind-\" to \"nid-\" and \"nindo-\" to \"nido-\".\n\nOjibwe also has a set of demonstrative pronouns, distinguishing animate/inanimate, here/there/yonder/over here, singular/plural, and proximate/obviative. The demonstratives differ in their phonetic forms very significantly across Ojibwe dialects and communities, so this table, based on the Minnesota dialect of Southwestern Ojibwe, will not be entirely correct for many speakers:\n\nOjibwe also has a set of \"indefinite\" pronouns (\"awiiya\", \"someone\", \"gegoo\", \"something,\" both of which can be preceded by \"gaawiin\" or \"akina\" to mean \"no one, nothing\" and \"everyone, everything,\" respectively).\n\nIn contrast to the Southwestern Ojibwe's demonstrative pronouns, Central Ojibwe, Northwestern Ojibwe and Western Ojibwe—which includes a larger set of obviatives—have a larger set of demonstratives:\n\nOjibwe verbs mark information not only on the subject (their animacy, person, and plurality) but also on the object. There are several different classes of verbs in the language, which differ based on whether they are transitive or intransitive and whether they take animate or inanimate subjects. These are the main classes:\nVerbs mark tenses with prefixes (\"gii-\", past, \"ga-\" and \"da-\", future, and \"wii-\", desiderative future), but also can take a myriad of affixes known as \"preverbs\", which convey a great amount of additional information about an action. For example, the preverb \"izhi-\" means \"in such a way,\" and so its addition to the verb root \"-ayaa-\", \"to be,\" makes the verb \"izhi-ayaa\", \"to be a certain way.\" The preverb \"bimi-\", \"along,\" combines with the verb root \"-batoo-\", \"to run,\" to form \"bimibatoo\", \"to run along, run by.\" The preferred order of these prefixes are personal prefix, tense prefix, directional prefix, relative prefix, any number of preverbs, and finally the verb. In addition, the initial syllable may be modified by an initial vowel change or by an initial syllable reduplication.\n\nFurthermore, there are three so-called \"orders\" of Ojibwe verbs. The basic one is called Independent Order, and is simply the indicative mood. There is also a Conjunct Order, which is most often used with verbs in subordinate clauses, in questions (other than simple yes-no questions), and with participles (participles in Ojibwe are verbal nouns, whose meaning is roughly equivalent to \"someone who is (VERB), does (VERB),\" for example, the word for \"traveler,\" \"bebaamaadizid\", is the third singular conjunct of \"babaamaadizi\", \"to travel about,\" and literally means \"someone who travels about\"). The final order is the Imperative Order, used with commands and corresponding to the imperative mood.\n\nNegatives are generally introduced by the leading word \"gaawiin\", which is usually translated as \"no,\" before introducing the actual words in their negative form. Negatives are generally formed by adding \"sii\" (or \"zii\") for independent order and \"si\" (or \"zi\") for conjunct order, both adding the negative element immediately after the root but before other suffixes. The \"sii\"/\"si\" are found after vowels while the \"zii\"/\"zi\" are found after \"n\". In some words, the final consonant is dropped and the \"sii\"/\"si\" are added to the remaining vowel, in other words the final \"m\" is converted to \"n\" before adding \"zii\"/\"zi\", yet in other words a linking vowel \"i\" (or \"aa\") is added after the final consonant and then the \"sii\"/\"si\" added. Imperatives do not follow the \"sii\" (\"zii\")/\"si\" (\"zi\") pattern.\n\nThere are three imperatives in Ojibwe: the \"immediate\" imperative, used to indicate that the action must be completely right away (\"nibaan!\", \"Sleep (right now)!\"), the \"delayed\" imperative, used to indicate that the action should be completely eventually, but not immediately (\"nibaakan!\", \"Sleep (in a little bit)!\"), and the \"prohibitive\" imperative, used to indicate that the action is prohibited (\"(gego) nibaaken!\", \"Don't sleep!\"). Like the negatives, the \"k\" in \"-k\", \"-ken\", \"-keg\" and \"-kegon\" take on the lenis form and become \"g\" after \"n\". Also like the negatives, the general the connector vowel between the imperative suffix and the terminal consonant here is \"i\"; however, for \"k\"/\"g\", the connector vowel instead is \"o\".\n\nAll verbs can also be marked for four \"modes:\" indicative (neutral), dubitative (the speaker is unsure about the validity of what they are saying, for example: \"bakade\", \"he is hungry,\" but \"bakadedog\", \"he must be hungry; he could be hungry\"), preterit (which emphasizes that the action occurred in the past, and is also used to refer to attempted or intended but uncompleted actions, for example: \"imaa ninamadab\", \"I'm sitting there,\" but \"imaa ninamadabiban\", \"I was sitting there; I meant to sit there\"), or preterit-dubitative (which expresses doubt about a past action: \"imaa namadabigoban\", \"she must have sat there; she could have sat there\").\n\nAs an example of some of the Ojibwe verbal distinctions at work, consider the conjugation of positive and negative indicative long-vowel-final VAI verbs (using the example \"nibaa\", \"to sleep\"):\n\nAlso as an example of some of the Ojibwe verbal distinctions at work, consider the conjugation of positive and negative indicative long-vowel-final VII verbs (using the example \"ozhaawashkwaa\", \"to blue\"). Note that unlike VAI verbs, VII do not have imperatives:\n\nPassives in intransitives can be expressed by using the marker igw, which may undergo a minor structural modification. Some examples of verb final containing the marker igw are:\nOjibwe, as with other Algonquian languages, also exhibits a direct–inverse system, in which transitive verbs are marked for whether or not the direction of the action follows a \"topicality hierarchy\" of the language. The topicality hierarchy in Ojibwe is 2 > 1 > X > 3 > 3’ > 0, determined by 1) person, 2) gender, and 3) obviation. Ojibwe has no case distinctions among agent, patient and experiencer theta roles, so in a transitive verb with two participants, the only way to distinguish subject from object is through direct/inverse/goal suffixes.\n\n\"Note: C, N, nN, S and Y are used in some of the tables below to indicate a generic consonant, n\\zh varying consonant, n\\nzh varying consonant, s\\sh varying consonant, and Ø\\i varying palatializer, respectively.\"\n\nThe local goals, non-local goals and reflective cause the stem to undergo minor adjustments:\n\nTransitive verbs can become VAI class of verbs by adding the actor-focused marker ige, which modifies the stem in a similar fashion as the marker igw. However, due to differences in dialects, how the actor-focused marker ige may show up differently.\n\nFor the first person and second person s, their s are specified if the words are in their Independent Order, and can also be known as local direct (first person ) and local inverse (second person ). A suffix indicates that the action is performed by someone higher on the person hierarchy on someone lower on the person hierarchy (e.g., by the addressee on the speaker, or by a proximate third person on an obviative):\n\nAn inverse suffix indicates that the action is performed by someone lower on the person hierarchy on someone higher on the person hierarchy (e.g., by the speaker on the addressee, or by an obviative third person on a proximate):\n\nAs can be seen, the only difference between these two verbs is the direct–inverse opposition, rather than case markers (or word order, when distinct nominals are used). An inverse verb is not equivalent to a passive verb. There is a separate passivity marker, denoted in literature as \"indefinite person (X)\", ranked in topicality hierarchy below first and second persons, but higher than animate and inanimate third persons:\n\nTo illustrate this, a generic VTA and VTI paradigm table, arranged by person hierarchy, is shown below. Note that the reflexive forms shown in a darker background with the reflexive theme /-idizo/ happen to be VAI. The table depicts only the paradigm for Independent Order, Positive Voice, Neutral Mode.\n\nOjibwe language is rich in its use of preverbs, which is a prefix that comes before verbs, nouns, and particles, to provide an additional layer of meaning. In Ojibwe, there are four classes of preverbs ranked in importance by six degrees:\n\nPreverbs, when they occur before a noun, are called a prenoun. Preverb class units when written are separated with a hyphen, with the exception of the class 4 preverb indicating manner, degree, quality/evaluative, or quantitative/numeric, which can also serve as functional part of a word stem as an initial. If several preverbs of the same class occur, they are written as a single block in order of rank of importance, with the most important preverb located closest to the word. Pronominal prefixes are written directly onto the head of the word group, so it may be found attached directly to the preverb if a preverb is present. When constructed, an Ojibwe word (in the example below, a verb) may have some or all of the pieces in the following form:\n\nExample, using \"nibaa\", \"to sleep\"\n\nNouns distinguish plurality, animacy, obviation, and case with suffixes. Animacy is only overtly marked on plural nouns. There are no core cases to distinguish categories such as \"subject\" or \"object\", but rather various oblique cases, including a locative (e.g., \"wiisiniwigamig\", \"restaurant\", \"wiisiniwigamigong\", \"in the restaurant\") and a vocative plural (e.g., \"Ojibwedog\", \"(you) Ojibwes!\"). Other suffixes are: pejorative (e.g., \"jiimaan\", \"canoe\", \"jiimaanish\", \"worthless canoe\"), diminutive (e.g., \"zhooniyaa\", \"money\", \"zhooniyaans\", \"coin\"), contemptive (e.g., \"odaabaan\", \"car\", \"odaabaanenh\", \"just some old car\"), preterit (which marks a deceased or no-longer existent person or object, e.g. \"nookomis\", \"my grandmother\", \"nookomisiban\", \"my late grandmother\"), and preterit-dubitative (which marks a deceased or no-longer existent person or object which was never known by the speaker, e.g. \"a'aw mindimooyenh\", \"that old woman\", \"a'aw mindimooyenyigoban\", \"that late old woman I never knew\").\n\nSome nouns are considered \"dependent\" and cannot be presented by themselves. Instead, these dependent nouns are presented with pronoun prefixes/suffixes attached to them. An example of a dependent noun is \"nookomis\" (\"my grandmother\") where the dependent root \"-ookomis-\" (\"grandmother\") must be presented with a pronoun affix, which in this case is \"n-\".\n\nOther nouns are derived from verbs by transforming them to their participle form. Of the choices, third person (and thus third person plural) is the most common form. Though each class of verbs may have their own participle-forming patterns, for simplicity, only the VAI neutral mode, positive participles are shown in the example, again, using \"nibaa\" (\"sleep\").\n\n\"Note: C, V, and VV are used in some of the tables below to indicate a generic consonant, a generic short vowel, and a generic long vowel, respectively.\"\n<br>\nVerbs additionally can be transformed into nouns representing concepts by adding \"-win\", or into nouns representing an object by adding \"-gan\" or \"-n\".\n\nPlurals and obviative suffixes are the easiest to add to Ojibwe words. By examining the plural, one can generally determine the underlying root of the word. Generally, animate plurals end with \"-g\", while inanimate plurals and obviatives end with \"-n\". Often, a linking vowel is required to join the root to one of these endings. Underlying \"-w\" or \"-y\" or an augment may affect the choice of linking vowels.\n<br>\n<br>\nDiminutives in Ojibwe express an idea of something that is smaller or younger version of the noun. All diminutives are treated as a Consonant Stem when made into one of the plural forms or into the obviative form, thus taking on the linking vowel \"-a-\". Contemptives are formed in a similar fashion as diminutives and are used to express negative or depreciative attitude the speaker may have of the noun. Contemptive plurals and obviatives remain as contemptives, but can take on the linking vowel \"-i-\" to add a possible pejorative. Many words to express fauna are often in contemptive forms. In the \"Ojibwemowin\" spoken in Wisconsin and certain areas of northwestern Ontario, often contemptives are reduced from \"-nh\"/\"-ny-\" forms to \"-ø\"/\"-y-\"; in Algonquin and in most Northwestern Ojibwe, the contemptives instead is reflected by \"-nzh\". In Odaawaa, the frequency of contemptives in fauna are higher than in other \"Anishinaabemowin\" dialects. For example, it is from the \"Daawaamwin\" word jidmoonh (\"red squirrel\") where the English word \"chipmunk\" has its origins, while the same word in \"Ojibwemowin\" is ajidamoo. When contemptive suffix is added for terms of endearment, any other d, t, z and s in the word are changed to j, ch, zh and sh respectively.\n\nLocatives indicate a location, and are indicated with \"-ng\". Locatives do not take on any plurals or obviative suffixes, but obviation possessor or the number can be added before the locative suffix. Another set of affixes in the Anishinaabe language is indicated by the possessive theme \"-m\" or the obviative possessor theme \"-ni\". Generally, dependent nouns and nouns ending with either \"-m\" or \"-n\" do not take the possessive theme \"-m\". A small group of nouns also do not ever take the possessive theme suffix.\n\nRarely do either the possessive theme \"-m\" or the obviative possessor theme \"-ni\" stand by themselves. The above examples for the possessive theme \"-m\" were for the first person singular. For other persons or number, again using the possessive theme \"-m\" as an example, the word is conjugated as following:\n\nPejoratives, marked with the \"-sh\" suffix, generally indicates a stronger negative feelings a speaker may have than that of the contemptive. However, pejorative may also indicate a term of affection. Some words take on different meaning in the pejorative, such as \"aniibiish\", which means \"no good elm\" but also means \"leaf\". In some dialects, some words are always shown in their pejorative forms, such as \"animosh\" for \"dog\".\n\nVocative plurals mimic pejorative conjugation patterns. It is identified with the \"-dog\" suffix, which in the Ottawa dialect shows up instead as \"-dig\" suffix.\n\nWhen the diminutive suffix \"ens\" or the affective suffix \"is\", is followed by the other, the \"s\" becomes \"z\", as in \"izens\" or \"enzis\". When the pejorative suffix \"ish\" is added to the diminutive suffix \"ens\", combination yields \"enzhish\", while adding the diminutive suffix \"ens\" to the pejorative suffix \"ish\", just as with any other Consonant Stem patterns, yields \"ishens\". In Northwestern Ojibwe dialect when the pejorative suffix \"ish\" is added, any other \"d\", \"t\", \"z\" and \"s\" in the word are changed to \"j\", \"ch\", \"zh\" and \"sh\" respectively.\n\nSingular vocatives do not follow a systematic pattern like plural vocatives do, with various strategies in achieving the vocative case:\nHowever, many irregular forms of achieving the vocative case also exist, including in some dialects unchanged forms such as \"noozhishenh\"! (my grandchild) used as a vocative, and vocative beyond the regular changed forms such as \"ninge\"! (my mother).\n\nOjibwe has no adjectives per se but verbs that function as adjectives. Thus, instead of saying \"the flower is blue,\" Ojibwe says something like to \"the flower blues\" (\"ozhaawashkwaa waabigwan\") or \"be a blueing flower\" (\"waabigwan-ozhaawashkwaa\"). Ojibwe has a copula, in some situations, which has a verb (several, in fact) that can be translated as \"to be\" and used in situations to equate one thing with another. However, a copula is not always used in Ojibwe, such as if demonstrative pronouns are used (\"jiimaan o'ow\", \"this is a canoe\").\n\nOjibwe language with its iambic accent system and relatively atonal word stresses, has any nuance of expressing word emphasis, stress, mood, etc., being expressed by particles like these:\nThe short initial 'i' is omitted typically when following a word or particle ending in a vowel or ending in 'n'.\n\nOther particles may be interjections like these:\nThe short initial vowel may be omitted typically in excited speech.\n\nOjibwe numbers are classified as a biquinary base-10 system.\n\nOjibwe initials of words may experience morphological changes under three modification strategies: \"initial consonant change\", \"initial vowel change\" and \"initial syllable reduplication\".\n\nOjibwe consonants are divided into lenis and fortis values:\n\nWhen either the past tense preverb \"gii-\" or the desiritive future tense \"wii-\" is added to a verb, if the verb begins with a lenis consonant, it may change to its fortis counterpart. In some dialects, such as with the Red Lake Ojibwe in Minnesota, this rule is suspended if the consonant in the verb's second syllable already contains a fortis consonant. In some dialects as in Odaawaa, this rule is not applied.\n\nIn general, verbs in conjunct and partitive orders and nouns of subjunctive order change the vowel quality of the first syllable in the manner shown in the table below.\n\nHowever, in some words beginning in \"dan-\", \"dazh-\", \"das-\", \"dash-\" or \"daa-\" instead take on the prefix \"en-\" to form \"endan-\", \"endazh-\", \"endas-\", \"endash-\" or \"endaa-\". The directional prefix \"bi-\", meaning \"over here,\" instead becomes \"ba-\".\n\nWords typically conveying repetitive actions have their very first syllable experience reduplication. Reduplication may be found in both verbs and in nouns. Vowel syncope process Eastern Ojibwe and Odaawaa experiences happen after the word has gone through reduplication. The most general reduplication pattern for the initial syllable is \"CV\" → \"CVCV\" but the table below shows the most common reduplication strategies.\n\nIn some words, the reduplicated consonant shifts from their lenis value to their fortis value. Yet in some stems, initial \"Cw-\" retains the \"-w-\" while others do not. Those words experiencing the prefix \"en-\" may change to \"in-\" before experiencing reduplication. Other prefixes such as \"gino-\" (long) does not follow the typical \"CV\" → \"CVCV\" pattern, and instead becomes \"gagaano-\".\n\nAs Ojibwe is highly synthetic, word order and sentence structure is relatively free, since a great deal of information is already encoded onto the verb. The subject can go before or after the verb, as can the object. In general, whichever participant is deemed more important or in-focus by the speaker is placed first, before the verb, and the less important participant follows the verb. Ojibwe tends to prefer a VS order (verb–subject) when subjects are specified with separate nominals or pronouns (e.g., \"bakade a'aw asabikeshiinh\", be.hungry that.there. net.make.., \"that spider is hungry\").\n\n\n\n"}

Pantribal sodalities sometimes arise in areas where two or more different cultures overlap and are in regular contact. Such sodalities are especially likely to develop in the presence of warfare between tribes. Drawing their membership from different villages of the same tribe, such groups could mobilize men in many local groups for attack or retaliation against another tribe. \n\nThe best examples come from the Great Plains of North America and from tropical Africa. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Native American societies of the Great Plains of the United States and Canada experienced a rapid growth of pantribal sodalities. This developmental reflected an economic change that followed the spread of horses, which had been reintroduced to the Americas by the Spanish, to the states between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi River.

Since the early days of the Christian faith, the term has applied to candidates for the clergy. It soon began to be applied to those who felt drawn to a more rigorous observance of their faith through the contemplative lifestyle of the hermits and monks and nuns.\n\nLater, Martin Luther taught that each individual was expected to fulfill his God-appointed task in everyday life. Although the Lutheran concept of the calling emphasized vocation, there was no particular emphasis on labor beyond what was required for one's daily bread. Calvinism transformed the idea of the calling by emphasizing relentless, disciplined labor. Calvin defined the role of \"the Christian in his vocation\", noting that God has prescribed appointed duties to men and styled such spheres of life vocations or callings. Calvinists distinguished two callings: a general calling to serve God and a particular calling to engage in some employment by which one's usefulness is determined.\n\nThe Puritan minister Cotton Mather discussed the obligations of the personal calling, writing of \"some special business, and some settled business, wherein a Christian should for the most part spend the most of his time; so he may glorify God by doing good for himself\". Mather admonished that it wasn't lawful ordinarily to live without some calling: \"for men will fall into \"horrible snares and infinite sins\". This idea has endured throughout the history of Protestantism. Almost three centuries after John Calvin's death in 1564 Thomas Carlyle would proclaim, \"The latest Gospel in this world is, 'know thy work and do it.'\"\n\nThe legacy of this religious ethic continues to exert its influence in secular society. Modern occupations which are seen as vocations often include those where a combination of skill and community help are implied, such as medical, care-giving, and veterinary occupations. Occupations where rewards are seen more in spiritual or other non-financial terms, such as religious occupations, are also seen as vocations. Borderline occupations, where community service and more personal reward are more evenly balanced, such as politics, may often be regarded as vocations.\n\nIn both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches, a candidate to the diaconate and priesthood is referred to as being called to this service in the Church. The term is also used for those in consecrated life.\n\nIn Protestant churches, the decision of a church to invite for appointment a particular minister - to \"invite in due form to the pastorate of a church (Presbyterian or Nonconformist)\" (OED) may be referred to as a \"call\", such as \"extending a call to so and so\", and is first cited from 1560 by the OED. In Evangelicalism, the sense of deliberate purpose before God is generally an expected part of the choice to seek ministerial work in the first place and is often referred to as a \"calling\" or \"call\".\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints describes a calling as \"a duty, position, or responsibility in the Church that is issued to a member by priesthood leaders... [it is] an opportunity to serve.\" The church uses a lay clergy, with no members receiving compensation for the execution of their callings. Prominent church leader J. Reuben Clark said, \"In the service of the Lord, it is not where you serve but how. In the [church], one takes the place to which one is duly called, which place one neither seeks nor declines.\"\n\n"}

Abdul Jabbar (born June 26, 1939, Sathankulam, Tamil Nadu) is a Tamil radio broadcaster, cricket commentator, writer and actor.\n\nS. M. Abdul Jabbar was born into a middle class Muslim family and grew up in the small town of Sathankulam, presently in Thoothukudi district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Having relatives in Sri Lanka, he relocated to Colombo for his higher studies. After completing his education he moved back to India due to the tense political situation in Sri Lanka.\n\nBorn in the Golden Age of Radio, Jabbar became a regular radio listener during his childhood in India and Sri Lanka. He often wrote letters to radio stations about their programs. On one occasion, he wrote a letter to All India Radio that was critical of its Tamil language cricket commentary. The letter was read on air, and he was invited to show his skill by providing Tamil commentary of the Ranji Trophy match between Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The opportunity changed his life.\n\nAbdul Jabbar already had considerable experience anchoring Tamil programs for the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation when he joined the AIR Chennai Tamil commentary team in 1979. He learned substantially from commentating with Tamil radio pioneer and cricket writer V Ramamurthy.

Ambedkarites and Buddhists refer to her as \"Mai\" or \"Maisaheb\", which stands for 'Mother' in Marathi language.\n\nIn B. R. Ambedkar's various movements, during the writing of the books, Indian Constitution and Hindu code bills and Buddhist mass conversion, she helped him from time to time. Babasaheb Ambedkar credited her in preface of his book \"The Buddha and His Dhamma\" for extending his life for eight-ten years.\n\nSavita Ambedkar was born on January 27, 1912 at Bombay in Saraswat Brahmin family. Her birth name was \"Sharada\". Her mother's name was Janaki and father name was Krishnarao Vinayak Kabir. Her family were a resident of Doors village, located in Rajapur tehsil of Ratnagiri district, Maharashtra. Later, her father came from Ratnagiri to Bombay. On the Sir Rao Bahadur C. K. Bole Road, near the pigeon in the west of Dadar The Kabir family had rented a house in Sahru's house in Matruchaya.\n\nSavita Ambedkar was a brilliant student. Her early education was completed in Pune. After that, around 1937 she did MBBS from Grant Medical College, Bombay. When her studies were completed, she was appointed as the first class medical officer in a major hospital in Gujarat. But after a few months of illness, she left his job and returned hime. Her six of eight siblings had inter-caste marriages. Those days it was an extraordinary thing for Saraswat Brahmin. Savita said, \"Our family did not oppose inter-caste marriages, because the whole family was educated and progressive.\"\n\nAt Bombay's Vile Parle, lived a doctor named S.M. Rao who had close links with B. R. Ambedkar. When Ambedkar came from Delhi to Bombay, he often used visit the doctor. Sharda Kabir also used to visit Dr. Rao's house as she had a family relation with him. One day Babasaheb Ambedkar had come from Delhi and Dr. Sharada Kabir was also present at that time. Dr. Rao formalized his identity by saying, \"This girl of my daughters friend is very clever, while being MBBS, Dr. Malavankar is working as a junior for a well-known doctor ... etc.\" Babasaheb was then the Labor Minister in the Viceroy's Executive Council. Until that time Dr. Sharda did not know much about Dr. Ambedkar, except that he is in Viceroy Council member. Dr. Sharada was impressed with Dr. Ambedkar's stunning personality. In his first meeting, she realized that Dr. Ambedkar was an extraordinary and great figure, In this first meeting, Ambedkar inquired about Kabir with apathy. The reason for this was that they were working on the advancement of women. Ambedkar congratulated them. There was also discussion about Buddhism in this meeting.\n\nHis second meeting took place in the Advice Room of Dr. Mavalankar. Ambedkar had blood pressure, blood sugar and joint pain at that time. In 1947, during the writing of the Indian Constitution, Bhimrao Ambedkar got health related problems due to diabetes and high blood pressure. He did not sleep. having neuropathic pain in the legs, Insulin and some homeopathic medicines could provide relief to some extent. He went to Bombay for treatment. At the same time, Dr. Sharada came closer to Ambedkar during treatment. Ambedkar's first wife, Ramabai Ambedkar, died in 1935 after a long illness. In this way, the rounds of meetings continued. Later correspondence also happened. And Ambedkar had a good life. There was talk of literature, society, religion etc. Sometimes they also debated. Ambedkar used to listen to Savita's arguments carefully and then respond. In 1947, Ambedkar started worrying about his health. There must be someone to take care of their health. In a letter to Dadasaheb Gaikwad on March 16, 1948, Ambedkar wrote, \"To keep a woman nurse or to take care of the house for service, there will be doubts in people's mind, so marriage is a better way.\" After the death of Yashwant's mother \"(Ramabai)\", I had decided not to marry, but in today's situation, I will have to give up my decision.\" Ambedkar took medical service from doctor Sharda Kabir for nature reasons. And both of them decided to get married.\n\nOn 15th April, 1948 Sharda Kabir married Bhimrao Ambedkar. She was 39 and he was 57. After their marriage, she was popularly called \"Mai\" (mother) by his followers. As registrar for marriage, Rameshwar Dayal, Deputy Commissioner, was called in Delhi. This marriage was completed as a Civil Marriage under the Civil Marriage Act. Among those who attended this occasion were Rai Sahab Puran Chand, Mr Macy (Private Secretary), Neelkanth, Ramkrishna Chandiwala, Estate Officer Meshram, nephew of Chitre, his wife, Sharda Kabir's brother. Also Home Secretary Banerjee On November 28, 1948, the newly married couple, the then governor-general of India, C. Rajagopalachari, invited them for the \"Sneh Bhoj\" and greeted them. After marriage Sharda adopted the name 'Savita'. But Ambedkar used to call him \"Shārū\" in old name, which was a word of \"Shāradā\". They already knew each other's thoughts.\n\nAfter marriage, Savita started serving husband. Ambedkar's health was steadily getting worse. She continued her care with full devotion till the last of Ambedkar's service. Ambedkar mentioned the help he received from wife in a book written on March 15, 1956, in a book \"The Buddha and His Dhamma\". In this preface, he mentioned that Savita Ambedkar increased his age by 8-10 years. After Ambedkar's death, his close friends and followers removed this role from this book. Its address dates back to 1980 AD. When the Bengali Buddhist author Bhagwan Das published his preface as a \"rare preface\".\n\nOn Ashok Vijaya Dashami \"(The Day on which Buddhism was accepted by Emperor Ashoka the Great)\" 14 October 1956, Savita Ambedkar accepted Buddhism along with her husband Bhimrao Ambedkar in Deekshabhoomi, Nagpur. She was given the initiation of Buddha's Dhamma by the Burmese Bhikkhu Mahastavir Chandramani giving Three Jewels and \"Five precepts\". After this, B. R. Ambedkar himself initiated Buddhism by giving 500,000 followers of Three Jewels, Five precepts and twenty-two pledges. This oath took place at 9 a.m.. Savita Ambedkar became the first woman to accept Buddhism of this conversion movement.\n\nMany People from Delhi came to meet B. R. Ambedkar at 26, Alipur Road, where Ambedkar was in residence. It wasn't possible that everyone should get a glimpse Ambedkar as he was sick. While on Savita Ambedkar was besides as wife and his doctor she had dual responsibilities.\n\nAfter the death of Babasaheb Ambedkar, some Ambedkarites blamed Savita Ambedkar for killing him. She separated from the Ambedkarite movement by describing her as a Brahmin. She took herself up to his farmhouse in Mehrauli in Delhi. The then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru formed a committee to investigate the matter, and that committee released her from the charges after the investigation.\n\nRepublican Party of India leader Ramdas Athavale and Gangadhar Gadhe brought her back to the mainstream Ambedkarite movement. Later on, she was separated from him as she grew older. Babasaheb Ambedkar was given the 'Bharat Ratna', the highest civilian award, it was accepted by Savita Ambedkar honoured by the then President Ramaswamy Venkataraman on April 14, 1990. It was his legendary birth anniversary. This award ceremony was held at the Darbar Hall / Ashok Hall of Rashtrapati Bhavan.\n\nSavita Ambedkar became lonely after her husband's death. Later, she rejoined the Dalit movement for some time. On April 19, 2003, she suffered difficulties in breathing, and was admitted to J.J. hospital. She died on 29 May 2003 at the age of 94 at J.J. Hospital in Mumbai.\n\nShe wrote a memorable and autobiographical Marathi book titled \"Dr. Ambedkaranchya Sahwasat\" (English: \"In contact with Dr. Ambedkar\"). She also contributed to \"Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (film)\".\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "12749679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12749679", "title": "Serial (literature)", "text": "Serial (literature)\n\nIn literature, a serial is a printing format by which a single larger work, often a work of narrative fiction, is published in smaller, sequential \"installments\". The installments are also known as \"numbers\", \"parts\" or \"fascicles\", and may be released either as separate publications or within sequential issues of a periodical publication, such as a magazine or newspaper.\n\nThe growth of moveable type in the 17th century prompted episodic and often disconnected narratives such as \"L'Astrée\" and \"Le Grand Cyrus\". At that time, books remained a premium item, so to reduce the price and expand the market, publishers produced large works in lower-cost installments called fascicles.\n\nSerialized fiction surged in popularity during Britain's Victorian era, due to a combination of the rise of literacy, technological advances in printing, and improved economics of distribution. Most Victorian novels first appeared as installments in monthly or weekly periodicals. The wild success of Charles Dickens's \"The Pickwick Papers\", first published in 1836, is widely considered to have established the viability and appeal of the serialized format within periodical literature. During that era, the line between \"quality\" and \"commercial\" literature was not distinct. Other famous writers who wrote serial literature for popular magazines were Wilkie Collins, inventor of the detective novel with \"The Moonstone\" and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories originally for serialization in \"The Strand\" magazine.\n\nWhile American periodicals first syndicated British writers, over time they drew from a growing base of domestic authors. The rise of the periodicals like \"Harper's\" and the \"Atlantic Monthly\" grew in symbiotic tandem with American literary talent. The magazines nurtured and provided an economic sustainability for writers, while the writers helped grow the periodicals' circulation base. During the late 19th century, those that were considered the best American writers first published their work in serial form and then only later in a completed volume format. As a piece in \"Scribner's Monthly\" explained in 1878, \"Now it is the second or third rate novelist who cannot get publication in a magazine, and is obliged to publish in a volume, and it is in the magazine that the best novelist always appears first.\" Among the American writers that wrote in serial form were Henry James and Herman Melville. A large part of the appeal for writers at the time was the broad audiences that serialization could reach, which would then grow their following for published works. One of the first significant American works to be released in serial format is \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which was published over a 40-week period by \"The National Era\", an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851 issue.\n\nSerialization was so standard in American literature that authors from that era often built installment structure into their creative process. James, for example, often had his works divided into multi-part segments of similar length. The consumption of fiction during that time was different than in the 20th century. Instead of being read in a single volume, a novel would often be consumed by readers in installments over a period as long as a year, with the authors and periodicals often responding to audience reaction.\n\nIn France, Alexandre Dumas and Eugène Sue were masters of the serialized genre. \"The Three Musketeers\" and \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" each appeared as a \"feuilleton\". \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" was stretched out to 139 installments. Eugène Sue's serial novel \"Le Juif errant\" increased circulation of \"Le Constitutionnel\" from 3,600 to 25,000. Production in book form soon followed and serialization was one of the main reasons that nineteenth-century novels were so long. Authors and publishers kept the story going if it was successful since authors were paid by line and by episode. Gustave Flaubert's \"Madame Bovary\" was serialized in \"La Revue de Paris\" in 1856.\n\nSome writers were prolific. Alexandre Dumas wrote at an incredible pace, oftentimes writing with his partner twelve to fourteen hours a day, working on several novels for serialized publication at once. However, not every writer could keep up with the serial writing pace. Wilkie Collins, for instance, was never more than a week before publication. The difference in writing pace and output in large part determined the author's success, as audience appetite created demand for further installments.\n\nIn the German-speaking countries, the serialized novel was widely popularized by the weekly family magazine \"Die Gartenlaube\", which reached a circulation of 382,000 by 1875. In Russia, \"The Russian Messenger\" serialized Leo Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\" from 1873 to 1877 and Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"The Brothers Karamazov\" from 1879 to 1880. In Poland, Bolesław Prus wrote several serialized novels: \"The Outpost\" (1885–86), \"The Doll\" (1887–89), \"The New Woman\" (1890–93), and his sole historical novel, \"Pharaoh\" (the latter, exceptionally, written entire over a year's time in 1894–95 and serialized only after completion, in 1895–96).\n\nIn addition, works in late Qing dynasty China had been serialized. \"The Nine-tailed Turtle\" was serialized from 1906 to 1910. \"Bizarre Happenings Eyewitnessed over Two Decades\" was serialized in \"Xin Xiaoshuo\" (T: 新小說, S: 新小说, P: \"Xīn Xiǎoshuō\"; W: \"Hsin Hsiao-shuo\"; \"New Fiction\"), a magazine by Liang Qichao. The first half of \"Officialdom Unmasked\" appeared in installments of \"Shanghai Shijie Fanhua Bao\", serialized there from April 1903 to June 1905.\n\nWith the rise of broadcast—both radio and television series—in the first half of the 20th century, printed periodical fiction began a slow decline as newspapers and magazines shifted their focus from entertainment to information and news. However, some serialization of novels in periodicals continued, with mixed success.\n\nThe first several books in the \"Tales of the City\" series by Armistead Maupin appeared from 1978 as regular installments in San Francisco newspapers. Similar serial novels ran in other city newspapers, such as \"The Serial\" (1976; Marin County), \"Tangled Lives\" (Boston), \"Bagtime\" (Chicago), and \"Federal Triangle\" (Washington, D.C.). Starting in 1984, Tom Wolfe's \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\", about contemporary New York City, ran in 27 parts in \"Rolling Stone\", partially inspired by the model of Dickens. The magazine paid $200,000 for his work, but Wolfe heavily revised the work before publication as a standalone novel. Alexander McCall Smith, author of \"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\" series, experimented in 2004 with publishing his novel \"44 Scotland Street\" in instalments every weekday in \"The Scotsman\". Michael Chabon serialized \"Gentlemen of the Road\" in \"The New York Times Magazine\" in 2007.\n\nThe emergence of the World Wide Web prompted some authors to revise a serial format. Stephen King experimented with \"The Plant\" (2000), and Michel Faber allowed \"The Guardian\" to serialise his novel \"The Crimson Petal and the White\". In 2005, Orson Scott Card serialized his out-of-print novel \"Hot Sleep\" in the first issue of his online magazine, \"InterGalactic Medicine Show\". In 2008 McCall Smith wrote a serialized online novel \"Corduroy Mansions\", with the audio edition read by Andrew Sachs made available at the same pace as the daily publication. In 2011, pseudonymous author Wildbow published \"Worm\", which remains one of the most popular web serials of all time.\n\nThe rise of fan fiction on the internet also follows a serial fiction style of publication, as seen on websites such as FanFiction.Net and Archive of Our Own (AO3).\n\nMany aspiring authors also used the web to publish free-to-read works in serialized format independently as well as web-based communities such as LiveJournal, Fictionpress.com, fictionhub, and Wattpad. Many of these books receive as many readers as successful novels; some have received the same number of readers as New York Times bestsellers.\n\nIn addition, the prevalence of mobile devices made the serial format even more popular with the likes of JukePop Serials, and Serial Box, with iOS and Android apps that focuses entirely on curating and promoting serialized novels.\n\n\n"}

However, typical \"soft targets\" are civilian sites where unarmed people congregate in large numbers; examples include national monuments, hospitals, schools, sporting arenas, hotels, cultural centers, movie theaters, cafés and restaurants, places of worship, nightclubs, shopping centers, transportation sites (such as railway stations, buses, rail systems, and ferries), and farmers' cooperatives. Soft targets are contrasted with hard targets, which typically restrict access to the public and are well-protected. Examples of hard targets include airports, government buildings, military installations, diplomatic missions, and power stations.\n\nTerrorist groups almost exclusively choose to strike soft targets. Of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1968 to 2005, 72% (8,111) struck soft targets and 27% (4,248) struck hard targets. The intent of attacks on soft targets is to instil fear as well as inflict casualties. Clark Kent Ervin notes that attacks on soft targets inflict psychological damage. In 2011, while preparations were being made for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the deputy commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service noted that if the primary targets were secure, terrorists might substitute targets that are nearby but not as well protected.\n\nMilitary and paramilitary groups may adopt a strategy of attacking soft targets in order to avoid direct confrontation with a stronger opponent. For example, U.S. military general John Galvin noted in 1987 that Contra rebels switched to civilian targets rather than continuing the direct fighting against the Sandinista National Liberation Front.\n\n\n"}

Swarachakra's alphabetical keyboard layout performed better than the Inscript layout (a QWERTY-based design and government standard in India). Currently, it is available for Android devices in twelve languages.\n\nWork on other languages is in progress. This is one of the many projects taken up to develop interactive products for developing countries at IDC.\n\nIndia is a multilingual country with 1,635 languages (including dialects and sub dialects) while Indian currency notes display 15 major languages. Although smartphone penetration is increasing in India, text input in Indic scripts has been a challenge for many years. According to the 2005 India Human Development Survey, the surveyed households reported that 72 per cent of men did not speak any English, 28 per cent spoke some English, and five per cent spoke fluent English. Among women, the corresponding percentages were 83, 17, and 3. While Indian languages are preferred in other means of communication in India (e.g. oral and written communication, radio, TV, newspapers and magazines), English is still the most preferred language for text input.\n\nThe focus of this project is to increase the Indian text input on smartphones and tablets. A better text input mechanism will be helpful to people with little or no knowledge of English, and also for those who prefer not to use English.\n\nText entry in Indian Languages has many challenges. Devanagari, for example, requires 52-65 keys to input just the frequently used characters (25 consonants, 9 semi-vowels, 3 frequent conjuncts, 13 vowels, a halant and the 13 vowel modifiers), whereas 26 keys are sufficient to represent Latin script. The government standard Inscript uses 42 keys but takes away many punctuation marks, including commonly used ones such as question marks and quotation marks. Further, it clubs unrelated characters on same key such as म ण, ह ङ, ऍ १, र ३, ज्ञ ५, त्र ६, क्ष ७, श्र. This is believed to be why Inscript and most other qwerty-based text input mechanisms have not become popular up until now.\n\nResearchers at IDC have been working on alternatives to QWERTY-based keyboards for Indic text input since 2001. Earlier projects included the design of hardware devices such as Dynakey, Barakhadi, Keylekh and e-Lekh. As mobile phones became smarter and more powerful, this group started working on text input alternatives for mobile phones in 2007 with Saral. Swarachakra and Disha were two designs developed in 2010 for touch-screen devices. In June 2013, Swarachakra was launched on Android devices. , more than 20 lakh people have downloaded Swarachakra from Google play store. Swarachakra has received appreciation from local newspapers in India \n\nand international magazines\n\n"}

The rheme (the rest of the clause) is in regular text. This type of clause sets up the theme-plus-rheme structure in the form of an equation, where theme = rheme. The equation is always expressed by some form of the verb \"be\".\n\nA thematic equative allows for all possible parts of a clause to be shifted to the start, to be the theme, so that the message can be structured in whatever way the speaker or writer wants. For example:\n\nMany common expressions are what are known as \"marked\" thematic equatives; these expressions include those that start with \"That's why ...\" and \"That's what ...\" (\"That's why you can't do it,\" \"That's what I meant\").\n\nA unique feature of the thematic equative is its conveying of a meaning of exclusiveness in the rheme.

This relieves the administrators or moderators of the task of constantly patrolling the board to watch for such language. This may also help the message board avoid content-control software installed on users' computers or networks, since such software often blocks access to Web pages that contain vulgar language.\n\nFiltered phrases may be permanently replaced as it is saved (example: phpBB 1.x), or the original phrase may be saved but displayed as the censored text. In some software users can view the text behind the wordfilter by quoting the post.\n\nSwear filters typically take advantage of string replacement functions built into the programming language used to create the program, to swap out a list of inappropriate words and phrases with a variety of alternatives. Alternatives can include:\n\nSome swear filters do a simple search for a string. Others have measures that ignore whitespace, and still others go as far as ignoring all non-alphanumeric characters and then filtering the plain text. This means that if the word \"you\" was set to be filtered, \"y o u\" or \"y.o!u\" would also be filtered.\n\nClichés—particular words or phrases constantly reused in posts, also known as \"memes\"—often develop on forums. Some users find that these clichés add to the fun, but other users find them tedious, especially when overused. Administrators may configure the wordfilter to replace the annoying cliché with a more embarrassing phrase, or remove it altogether.\n\nInternet forums are sometimes attacked by vandals who try to fill the forum with repeated nonsense messages, or by spammers who try to insert links to their commercial web sites. The site's wordfilter may be configured to remove the nonsense text used by the vandals, or to remove all links to particular websites from posts.\n\nLameness filters are text-based wordfilters used by Slash-based websites (i.e. Textboards and Imageboards) to stop junk comments from being posted in response to stories. Some of the things they are designed to filter include:\n\n\nSince wordfilters are automated and look only for particular sequences of characters, users aware of the filters will sometimes try to circumvent them by changing their lettering just enough to avoid the filters. A user trying to avoid a vulgarity filter might replace one of the characters in the offending word into an asterisk, dash, or something similar. Some administrators respond by revising the wordfilters to catch common substitutions; others may make filter evasion a punishable offense of its own. A simple example of evading a wordfilter would be entering symbols between letters or using leet. More advanced techniques of wordfilter evasion include the use of images, using hidden tags, or Cyrillic characters (i.e. a homograph spoofing attack).\n\nAnother method is to use a soft hyphen. A soft hyphen is only used to indicate where a word can be split when breaking text lines and is not displayed. By placing this halfway in a word, the word gets broken up and will in some cases not be recognised by the wordfilter.\n\nSome more advanced filters, such as those in the online game \"RuneScape\", can detect bypassing. However, the downside of sensitive wordfilters is that legitimate phrases get filtered out as well.\n\nWordfilters are coded into the Internet forums or chat rooms, and operate only on material submitted to the forum or chat room in question. This distinguishes wordfilters from content-control software, which is typically installed on an end user's PC or computer network, and which can filter all Internet content sent to or from the PC or network in question. Since wordfilters alter a user's words without his or her consent, some users still consider them to be censorship, while others consider them an acceptable part of a forum operator's right to control the contents of the forum.\n\nA common quirk with wordfilters, often considered either comical or aggravating by users, is that they often affect words that are not intended to be filtered. This is a typical problem when short words are filtered. For example, one may see, \"Do you need istance for playing clical music?\" Multiple words may be filtered if whitespace is ignored, resulting in \"as suspected\" becoming \" uspected\". Prohibiting a phrase such as \"hard on\" will result in filtering innocuous statements such as \"That was a hard one!\" and \"Sorry I was hard on you,\" into \"That was a e!\" and \"Sorry I was you.\"\n\nSome words that have been filtered accidentally can become replacements for profane words. One example of this is found on the Myst forum Mystcommunity. There, the word 'manuscript' was accidentally censored for containing the word 'anus', which resulted in 'm****cript'. The word was adopted as a replacement swear and carried over when the forum moved, and many substitutes, such as \" 'scripting \", are used (though mostly by the older community members).\n\nPlace names may be filtered out unintentionally due to containing portions of swear words. In the early years of the internet, the British place name Penistone was often filtered out from spam and swear filters.\n\nMany games, such as \"World of Warcraft\", and more recently, Habbo Hotel and RuneScape allow the user to turn the filters off. Other games, especially free Massively multiplayer online games, such as Knight Online do not have such an option. \n\nOther games such as Medal of Honor and Call of Duty (except \"\", \"\", \"\", and \"\") do not give users the option to turn off scripted foul language, while Gears of War does.\n\nIn addition to games, Profanity Filters can be used to moderate the user generated content in forums, blogs, social media apps, kid's websites, and product reviews. There are many profanity filter APIs like WebPurify that help in replacing the swear words with other characters (i.e. \"@#$!\"). These profanity filters APIs work with profanity search and replace method.\n\n\n\nreplaces characters with similar Unicode chars from different character sets (e.g. Cyrillic)\n"}

YouTube Poop videos are traditionally uploaded to the video sharing website YouTube, hence the name, but may be mirrored or uploaded on other sites like Newgrounds, Vimeo and Dailymotion (usually for reasons involving copyright).\n\nA typical YouTube Poop video uses visual and auditory effects to alter the underlying work. Some of these videos may involve completely or partially repurposing sources to create or convey a story, while others follow a non-linear narrative, and some may contain no storyline at all. Alternatively, a YouTube Poop may consist solely of an existing video repeated in a slowed or remixed loop. In many cases, YouTube Poops utilize a bizarre sequence of elements that may entertain, confuse, or irritate, depending on the viewer. Associate professor of cultural anthropology at Kansas State University, Michael Wesch, has defined YouTube Poops as \"absurdist remixes that ape and mock the lowest technical and aesthetic standards of remix culture to comment on remix culture itself\".\n\nMedia sources of YouTube Poops include television shows, movies, cartoons, commercials, video games, and other videos obtained from YouTube or elsewhere. In the late 2000s, cutscenes from games released on the Philips CD-i platform (most notably, \"Hotel Mario\", , and later \"I.M. Meen\") were an incredibly common source in YTPs, because the campy and egregious nature of the animations made them ripe for satire.\nYouTube Poop is often derivative in the sense that the work of one artist (or \"pooper\") is sometimes used as the underlying work for another video. Lawrence Lessig, Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, referred to this behavior as an example of \"call & response\" within a remix culture. Alternately, two YouTube Poopers may engage in \"YTP tennis\" or \"YTP soccer\", wherein the same video is remixed back and forth.\n\nAnother prominent type of video in the community is known as a \"collab\", which is where a group of YouTube Poopers' videos are compiled to make a longer video; often, the videos featured are made exclusively for the collab and are not uploaded to YouTube prior to the collab's release.\n\nDue to the use of copyrighted materials and the manner in which these sources are depicted, YTPs may be removed from YouTube following a DMCA complaint. However, political scientist and author Trajce Cvetkovski noted in 2013 that, despite Viacom filing a copyright infringement lawsuit with YouTube in 2007, YouTube Poops such as \"The Sky Had a Weegee\" by Hurricoaster, which features scenes from the animated series \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" (in particular, the episode \"Shanghaied\") and Weegee (a satiric caricature based on Nintendo's Luigi as he appears in DOS version of \"Mario Is Missing\"), remained on YouTube.\n\nThe law in the United Kingdom does allow people to use copyrighted material for the purposes of parody, pastiche, and caricature without infringing on the copyright of the material. Copyright owners are only able to sue the parodist if the work contains hateful or discriminative messages. If the case is then taken to court, it will be down to a judge to decide whether the video meets these criteria.\n\nIndividuals involved in YouTube Poops sometimes make efforts to take YouTube Poopers' videos down because mature and defamatory content is prevalent in them, especially if they have a large audience of children watching their work. Children's poet Michael Rosen (who claims to have \"become a cult\" among YouTube Poopers) initially attempted to take his videos down, but after a few frank discussions with YouTube Poopers, he decided to allow the videos to stay online, comparing the remixes to the use of photo editing software in a later interview. Rosen issued a warning on his website, saying that:\nHe put a similar warning on his YouTube channel's about page.\n\n"}
