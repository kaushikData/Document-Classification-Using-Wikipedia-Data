{"id": "19867926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19867926", "title": "Adventive species", "text": "Adventive species\n\nAn adventive species is a species that has arrived in a new locality. It may have had help from humans as an introduced species or it may not.\n\nThe term is now used by some writers in a more restricted sense than its initial usage. The earliest and most widespread concept among biologists is that of a species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region (without further caveats). This is the forerunner of the term 'non-indigenous species', although it lacks the frequently invoked basis of the word 'introduced', which means different things to different writers. In this sense, the cattle egret (\"Bubulcus ibis\"), which arrived in North America by natural range expansion, the black rat (\"Rattus rattus\"), which is believed to have arrived as a hitchhiker aboard ships, and the kudzu vine (\"Pueraria lobata\"), which was introduced deliberately by humans, are all adventive species and have established populations. Common adventive species include herbivorous insects.\n\nThe later and more limited concept is that of a species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region, but its population is not self-sustaining. Population numbers are only increased through re-introduction. After some time, an adventive species may become naturalized; or, some populations do not sustain themselves reproductively, but exist because of continued influx from elsewhere. Such a non-sustaining population, or the individuals within it, are said to be adventive. Cultivated plants are a major source of adventive populations. It is estimated that 10-20% of adventive species used in biological control programs eventually become naturalized.\n\nWe can readily see how this second (later) concept applies to cultivated plants. Those that grow within the confines of culture are ‘adventive’; those that grow outside those confines are ‘naturalized’. But the concept falls apart when applied to the far more numerous species of invertebrate animals and microorganisms: extremely few of these are cultured, and by the time they are detected in nature they tend to be established (‘naturalized’).\n\n"}

{"id": "58583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58583", "title": "Bethel", "text": "Bethel\n\nBethel (Ugaritic: \"bt il\", meaning \"House of El\" or \"House of God\", \"ḇêṯ’êl\", also transliterated \"Beth El\", \"Beth-El\", \"Beit El\"; ; ) was a border city described in the Hebrew Bible as being located between Benjamin and Ephraim and also a location named by Jacob. Under Israelite rule, Bethel first belonged to the Tribe of Benjamin, but was later conquered by the Tribe of Ephraim.\n\nEusebius of Caesarea and Jerome describe Bethel in their time as a small village that lay 12 Roman miles north of Jerusalem, to the right or east of the road leading to Neapolis.\n\nModern scholar Edward Robinson identified the village of Beitin in the West Bank with ancient Bethel in \"Biblical Researches in Palestine, 1838–52\". He based this assessment on its fitting the location described in earlier texts, and on the philological similarities between the modern and ancient name, arguing that the replacement of the Hebrew \"el\" with the Arabic \"in\" was not unusual.\n\nTen years after the Six-Day War, the biblical name was applied to an Israeli settlement Beit El constructed adjacent to Beitin. In several countries—particularly in the US—the name has been given to various locations (see Bethel (disambiguation)).\n\nBethel is mentioned several times in Genesis. It is first mentioned in Genesis 12 and 13, as a place near where Abram stayed and built an altar on his way to Egypt and on his return. It is said to be close to Hai (Ai) and just to the west of it. More famously it is mentioned again in Genesis 28, when Jacob, fleeing from the wrath of his brother Esau, falls asleep on a stone and dreams of a ladder stretching between Heaven and Earth and thronged with angels; God stands at the top of the ladder, and promises Jacob the land of Canaan; when Jacob awakes he anoints the stone (baetylus) with oil and names the place Bethel. Another account, from Genesis 35 repeats the covenant with God and the naming of the place (as El-Bethel), and makes this the site of Jacob's own change of name to Israel. Both versions state that the original name of the place was Luz, a Canaanite name.\n\nBethel is mentioned again in the book of Joshua 7:2, 8:9 as being close to Ai and on the west side of it; in this episode Joshua sent men from Jericho to capture Ai. At Joshua 16:1 it is again said to be next to Luz, near Jericho, and part of the territory of the descendants of Joseph (that is Manasseh and Ephraim, cf. Joshua 16:4).\n\nIn the book of Judges 1:22 ff the descendants of Joseph capture the city of Bethel, which again is said to have previously been called Luz. At Judges 4:5 the prophetess Deborah is said to dwell at Bethel under the palm-tree of Deborah (presumably a reference to Genesis 35:8, where another Deborah, the nurse of Jacob's mother Rebecca, is said to have been buried under a tree at Bethel). Bethel is said in Judges 4:5 to be in Mt Ephraim.\n\nAt Judges 20:18, where the Hebrew Beth-El is translated in the King James Version as the 'House of God', the people of Israel go to Bethel to ask counsel of God when they are planning to attack the Benjaminites at the battle of Gibeah. They make a second visit (Judges 20:26) after losing the battle. Bethel was evidently already an important religious centre at this time; so important in fact that the Ark of the Covenant was kept there, under the care of Phinehas the grandson of Aaron (Judges 20:27f). At Judges 21:19, Bethel is said to be south of Shiloh. At the next mention of the Ark, in 1 Samuel 4:3, it is said to be kept at Shiloh.\n\nIn the book I Samuel 7:16, it is said that the prophet Samuel, who resided at Ramah, used to make a yearly circuit of Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpah to judge Israel. At I Samuel 10:3, Samuel tells Saul to go to Bethel to visit the 'Hill of God', where he will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with a 'psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp'. It appears that there was a Philistine garrison there at that time. Bethel is mentioned again in I Samuel 13:2 and 2 Samuel 30:27.\n\nAfter the kingdom of Israel was split into two kingdoms on the death of King Solomon (c.931 BC), Jeroboam, the first king of the northern Kingdom of Israel, made two calves of gold (1 Kings 12:28 ff) and set one up in Bethel, and the other in Dan in the far north of his kingdom. This was apparently to make it unnecessary for the people of Israel to have to go to Jerusalem to worship in the temple there. It seems that this action provoked the hostility of the Judaeans. A story is told at 1 Kings 13:1 ff of how a man from Judah visited the shrine at Bethel and prophesied that it would eventually be destroyed by Josiah.\n\nAt 2 Kings 2:1ff the prophets Elijah and Elisha are said to have visited Bethel on a journey from Gilgal to Jericho shortly before Elijah was taken up to heaven without dying (2 Kings 2:11). (9th century BC). Later, when Elisha returned alone to Bethel, he is said to have been taunted by some young men (not 'young boys' as it is translated in some English Bibles) as he climbed up to the shrine, and cursed them; whereupon 42 of the young men were killed by bears (2 Kings 2:23ff). \n\nBethel is next mentioned in connection with the tenth king of Israel, Jehu (c.842-815 BC). Despite his killing of the prophets of Baal and destruction of their temple, it is said that Jehu continued to tolerate the presence of the golden calves in Bethel and Dan. (2 Kings 10:29). The shrine at Bethel apparently avoided destruction in the Assyrian invasions of the kingdom of Israel in c.740 and 722, but was finally completely destroyed by King Josiah of Judah (c.640-609 BC). \n\nBethel is mentioned in Ezra 2:28 and Nehemiah 7:32 as being resettled at the time of the return of the exiles from Babylon.\n\nThe shrine is mentioned with disapproval by the prophet Amos (c. 750):\n\nBut seek not Beth–el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer–sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth–el shall come to nought. -King James Bible\n\nBut prophesy not again any more at Beth–el: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court. -King James Bible\n\nA few years later the prophet Hosea (10:15) (8th century BC) speaks of the \"wickedness\" of Bethel (at least according to modern translations) and Jeremiah (48:13) (6th century BC) speaks of the \"shame\" which it brought on Israel. Hosea 13:1–3 describes how the Israelites are abandoning Adonai for the worship of Baal, and accuses them of making or using images for 'idol' worship. Chief among these, it appears, was the image of the bull at Bethel, which by the time of Hosea was being worshipped as an image of Baal.\n\nBethel was again inhabited and fortified by Bacchides the Syrian in the time of the Maccabees. Josephus tells us that Bethel was captured by Vespasian. Robinson notes that after the writings of Eusebius and Jerome, he found no further references to Bethel in the written historical record. However, he notes that the ruins at Beitin are greater than those of a village and seem to have undergone expansion after the time of Jerome, noting also the presence of what appear to be ruins of churches from the Middle Ages.\n\n"}
{"id": "1772690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1772690", "title": "Broadcast journalism", "text": "Broadcast journalism\n\nBroadcast journalism is the field of news and journals which are \"broadcast\", that is, published by electrical methods instead of the older methods, such as printed newspapers and posters. Broadcast methods include radio (via air, cable, and Internet), television (via air, cable, and Internet) and the World Wide Web. Such media disperse pictures (static and moving), visual text and sounds.\n\nBroadcast articles can be written as \"packages\", \"readers\", \"voice-overs\" (VO) and \"sound on tape\" (SOT).\n\nA \"sack\" is an edited set of video clips for a news story and is common on television. It is typically narrated by a reporter. It is a story with audio, video, graphics and video effects. The news anchor, or presenter, usually reads a \"lead-in\" (introduction) before the package is aired and may conclude the story with additional information, called a \"tag\".\n\nA \"reader\" is an article read without accompanying video or sound. Sometimes an \"over the shoulder digital on-screen graphic\" is added.\n\nA voice-over, or VO, is a video article narrated by the anchor.\n\nSound on tape, or SOT, is sound or video usually recorded in the field. It is usually an interview or soundbite.\n\nRadio was the first medium for broadcast journalism. Many of the first radio stations were co-operative community radio ventures not making a profit. Later, radio advertising to pay for programs was pioneered in radio. Later still, television displaced radio and newspapers as the main news sources for most of the public in industrialized countries.\n\nSome of the programming on radio is locally produced and some is broadcast by a radio network, for example, by syndication. The \"talent\" (professional voices) talk to the audience, including reading the news. People tune in to hear engaging radio personalities, music, and information. In radio news, stories include speech soundbites, the recorded sounds of events themselves, and the anchor or host.\n\nSome radio news might run for just four minutes, but contain 12–15 stories. These new bulletins must balance the desire for a broad overview of current events with the audience's limited capacity to focus on a large number of different stories.\n\nThe radio industry has undergone a radical consolidation of ownership, with fewer companies owning the thousands of stations. Large media conglomerates such as Clear Channel Communications own most of the radio stations in the United States. That has resulted in more \"niche\" formats and the sharing of resources within clusters of stations, de-emphasizing local news and information. There has been concern over whether this concentration serves the public. The opposition says that the range of political views expressed is greatly narrowed and that local concerns are neglected, including local emergencies, for which communication is critical. Automation has resulted in many stations broadcasting for many hours a day with no one on the station premises.\n\nWhen radio first became popular, it was not used as a source of information; rather, people listened to the radio solely for entertainment purposes. This began to change with a man named Edward R. Murrow. Edward Murrow was an American who traveled to England in order to broadcast news about World War II. He stayed in London throughout the war and was the first to report on events such as bombings in London and updated the people on Hitler's reign. Murrow gained his fame mainly after reporting on Hitler's German army annexing Austria. Many Americans relied on his broadcasts throughout the war to gain information about the war.\n\nMore people also began to rely on radio for information after the attacks on Pearl Harbor. People found out about the bombing through President Roosevelt's broadcast interrupting their daily programming. It set Americans on edge, and people began to rely more heavily on the radio for major announcements throughout World War II. World War II was a time where radio broadcasting became a much larger industry because it was the easiest and quickest way for people to get updates on what was going on throughout the world.\n\nInformative radio continued while television reporting also began to take flight. Throughout the 40's and 50's television news sources grew, but radio still dominated. It wasn't until John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963 that television newscasting took off. Radio could only capture the sound of the event, but television showed people the true horror of the assassination. This was one of the first major events in which news companies competed with each other to get the news out to the public first. CBS News was the first to report that Kennedy had been shot and was killed. News crews spent the next several days covering everything happening in Washington, including Kennedy's funeral. This set the standard for news stations to have to cover major events quicker and get them out to the public as they were happening. The JFK assassination helped to transform television journalism to how it is today, with instantaneous coverage and live coverages at major events. Television offered faster coverage than radio and allowed viewers to feel more as if they were experiencing the event because they could visualize exactly what was going on.\n\nNBC (National Broadcasting Company) and CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System) were the two competing forces of news broadcasting in the early years of broadcast journalism. NBC was established in 1926 and CBS in 1927. There was a divide in the industry because they were not only competing against each other, but radio news that had already been established.\n\nWomen had a hard time immersing themselves into radio news seeing as most of the radio broadcasts were men. There was a small amount of women who hosted programs that were for homemakers and were on entertainment broadcast. After World War II, the doors for women in broadcasting opened up. This was also due to the shortage of men that were home during the war, so news outlets looked to women to fill those gaps of times. In the 1960s and 1970s larger numbers of women began to enter into broadcast news field.\n\nBoth radio and television are major sources for broadcast journalism today, even with rapidly expanding technology. Television still focuses on covering major events, but radio broadcasts focus more on analyzing stories rather than reporting breaking news. The internet often beats out broadcast journalism in terms of reporting breaking news, and the field of broadcast journalism is constantly having to adapt to the changing technology of today.\n\nTelevision (TV) news is considered by many to be the most influential medium for journalism. For most of the American public, local news and national TV newscasts are the primary news sources. Not only the numbers of audience viewers, but the effect on each viewer is considered more persuasive (\"The medium is the message\"). Television is dominated by attractive visuals (including beauty, action, and shock), with short soundbites and fast \"cuts\" (changes of camera angle). Television viewing numbers have become fragmented, with the introduction of cable news channels, such as Cable News Network (CNN), Fox News Channel and MSNBC.\nThe industry divides local television in North America into media markets. These television markets are defined by viewing area and are ranked by the number of audience viewers. New broadcast journalists generally start in the smaller markets with fewer viewers and move up to larger television stations and television networks after gaining experience. The larger stations usually have more resources and better pay.\n\nUnited States stations typically broadcast local news three or four times a day: around 4:30–6 am, 11:30 or noon, 5 or 6 pm, and 10 or 11 at night. Most of the nightly local newscasts are 30 minutes, and include sports television and weather. News anchors are shown sitting at a desk in a television studio. The news anchors read teleprompters that contain local interest stories and breaking news. Reporters frequently tell their stories outside the formal television studio in the field, in a remote broadcast setting where Electronic news-gathering (ENG) techniques are used with production trucks. Daytime television or morning shows include more \"soft\" news and feature pieces, while the evening news emphasizes \"hard\" news.\n\nNews anchors (formerly \"anchormen\") serve as masters-of-ceremonies and are usually shown facing a professional video camera in a television studio while reading unseen teleprompters. The anchors are often in pairs (co-anchors), who sit side by side and often alternate their reading. Meteorologists stand in front of chroma key backgrounds to describe weather forecasting and show maps, charts and pictures. Reporters research and write the stories and sometimes use video editing to prepare the story for air into a \"package\". Reporters are usually engaged in electronic field production (EFP) and are accompanied by a videographer at the scenes of the news; the latter holds the camera. The videographer or assistants manage the audio and lighting; they are in charge of setting up live television shots and might edit using a non-linear editing system (NLE). Segment producers choose, research and write stories, as well as deciding the timing and arrangement of the newscast. Associate producer, if any, specialize in other elements of the show such as graphics.\n\nA newscast director is in charge of television show preparation, including assigning camera and talent (cast) positions on the set, as well as selecting the camera shots and other elements for either recorded or live television video production. The technical director (TD) operates the video switcher, which controls and mixes all the elements of the show. At smaller stations, the Director and Technical Director are the same person.\n\nA graphics operator operates a character generator (CG) that produces the lower third on-screen titles and full-page digital on-screen graphics. The audio technician operates the audio mixing console. The technician is in charge of the microphones, music and audio tape. Often, production assistants operate the teleprompters and professional video cameras and serve as lighting and rigging technicians (grips).\n\nBroadcast journalism is changing rapidly, causing issues within the business as well. Many people can no longer find jobs in broadcast journalism because much more is online and does not even need to be broadcast by a person. Others are being laid off to invest more money into new technologies. Other changes include innovations allowing TV stations to better alert viewers in emergencies and have higher quality services. \n\nConvergence is the sharing and cross-promoting of content from a variety of media, all of which, in theory, converge and become one medium. In broadcast news, the internet is a key to convergence. Frequently, broadcast journalists also write text stories for the Web, usually accompanied by the graphics and sound of the original story. Websites offer the audience an interactive form where they can learn more about a story, can be referred to related articles, can offer comments for publication and can print stories at home. Technological convergence also lets newsrooms collaborate with other media, broadcast outlets sometimes have partnerships with their print counterparts. \n\nCitizen broadcast journalism is a new form of technology that has allowed regular civilians to post stories they see through outlets such as Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter. It has become a new trend that some allegedly fear will take over broadcast journalism as it is known. News companies, like Fox News, are employing citizen journalists, which is a new phenomenon among journalism. \n\nThe term \"fake news\" or Yellow journalism has taken over broadcast journalism throughout the past and current years. Its impact on broadcast journalism played a role in how news about the election was spread. Fake news defines how viewers see news that may be misleading or false. The main aim of Yellow Journalism is to gather the attention of people in the society. Many of these false or misleading stories came out during the 2016 election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\n"}

The episode features Paul Winfield, who previously played Captain Terrell in \"\", and Ashley Judd in her debut acting performance. It describes an incident in which the crew of the \"Enterprise\" is unable to establish meaningful communication with the crew of an alien vessel, which is resolved by the struggle of the ships' captains to defend each other from a vicious beast. It is often cited as one of the best episodes of the series.\n\nThe senior crew discuss their latest mission: to make contact with the Tamarian race who have been transmitting signals toward Federation space for weeks. They mention that several prior contacts have occurred, but no meaningful interaction has ever been achieved because the way the Tamarians communicate could not be understood. The \"Enterprise\" makes contact with a Tamarian ship in orbit around the planet El-Adrel. Though the universal translator can translate their words, the Tamarians communicate only through allegory, which baffles the \"Enterprise\" crew because they do not understand this yet nor do they even know the stories to which the Tamarians are referring. Likewise, the Tamarians seem equally baffled by and unable to understand Picard's straightforward use of language.\n\nFrustrated by their failure at communication, the Tamarian captain, Dathon, has himself and Captain Picard transported to the planet's surface. The Tamarians then create a scattering field in the planetary atmosphere to prevent transport functions from being used on either captain. On the surface, Dathon utters the phrase \"Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra\" and tosses Picard a dagger. Picard is unsure if this is some kind of formal challenge to a duel and so tosses it back to Dathon. As night falls, Picard fails to make a fire and Captain Dathon shares his fire with the phrase \"Temba, his arms wide.\" The next morning, Dathon comes running and Picard realizes that there is also a hostile predator in the area that is stalking them both. Picard finally begins to understand the way the Tamarians communicate when he recites one of the allegories and sees the meaning underneath it: it is a direction on the tactic Dathon wants to use to fight the beast.\n\nThe two attempt to fight the beast together, but because of the Enterprise's ultimately unsuccessful transporter attempt to rescue Picard mid-battle prevents him from participating at a crucial moment, Dathon is severely wounded.\n\nOn the \"Enterprise\", First Officer Riker and the crew struggle to understand the aliens' language and Riker has Commander Data work with ship's counselor Troi in hopes of translating it. Lt. Worf, in the meantime, thinks that the Captain is being tested as a warrior and advocates an aggressive stance, which Riker says he will take as a last option. Riker has Worf take a shuttlecraft to try to retrieve the Captain, which fails when the aliens precisely disable the craft and force it to return to the \"Enterprise\". Chief Engineer La Forge and Worf work on a way to disable the Tamarians' scattering field to beam up Picard, while Troi and Data work on deciphering the Tamarian language. They deduce that it is entirely based on allegories from Tamarian folklore. They learn that Darmok was a hunter and Tanagra is an island but nothing else. Without the stories behind the allegories, the Tamarian language remains indecipherable.\n\nWhile tending to Dathon's wounds, Picard keeps him talking and slowly deduces that Darmok and Jalad were two warriors who met on an island called Tanagra and had to cooperate to defeat a dangerous beast dwelling there, becoming friends in the process. Dathon tried to recreate this event between himself and Picard on El-Adrel, hoping that their shared adversity would forge a friendship where words had failed. Picard recounts for Dathon the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", a human story that parallels the allegory of Darmok and Jalad. Dathon seems to understand and appreciate the story but eventually succumbs to his wounds.\n\nThe \"Enterprise\" fires on the Tamarian ship, disabling the scattering field, and beams up Picard. He uses his newfound knowledge of Tamarian allegories to communicate a basic message to the Tamarians and end the battle; when Picard returns Dathon's personal journal to them, the Tamarians record announce the story as \"Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel\" and add a new phrase to their language.

An additional day was August 8 for the blue screen unit to film the creature scenes with stuntman Rex Pierson on Paramount Stage 9. Second unit for this episode filmed on August 26 on Paramount Stages 9 and 16. When production for the following episode, \"\", returned to location at Bronson Canyon on August 5, another sequence was filmed for \"Darmok\" involving Rex Pierson and photo doubles Ron Large and Lanier Edwards. Photo double Dana Vitatoe filmed additional second unit shots on August 28 on Paramount Stage 9. The call sheet dated on July 18 featured an \"uncast actress\" in the role of Lt. Larson; in the final episode, this role became Robin Lefler, who was played by Ashley Judd.\n\n"}

In the case of inanimate objects the word dosing is typical. The term dose titration, referring to stepwise adjustment of doses until a desired level of effect is reached, is common in medicine.\n\nThe word \"dosing\" is very commonly used by engineers in thermal power stations, in water treatment, in any industry where steam is being generated, and in building services for heating and cooling water treatment. Dosing procedures are also in vogue in textile and similar industries where chemical treatment is involved.\n\nCommercial swimming pools also require chemical dosing in order to control pH balance, chlorine level, and other such water quality criteria. Modern swimming pool plant will have bulk storage of chemicals held in separate dosing tanks, and will have automated controls and dosing pumps to top up the various chemicals as required to control the water quality.\n\nIn a power station treatment chemicals are injected or fed to boiler and also to feed and make up water under pressure, but in small dosages or rate of injection. The feeding at all places is done by means of small capacity dosing pumps specially designed for the duty demanded.\n\nIn building services the water quality of various pumped fluid systems, including for heating, cooling, and condensate water, will be regularly checked and topped up with chemicals manually as required to suit the required water quality. Most commonly inhibitors will be added to protect the pipework and components against corrosion, or a biocide will be added to stop the growth of bacteria in lower temperature systems. The required chemicals will be added to the fluid system by use of a dosing pot; a multi-valved chamber in which the chemical can be added, and then introduced to the fluid system in a controlled manner.\n\nIn food industries, the dosing of ingredients is particularly important in order to ensure the quality of the recipe as well as its food safety where the consumers' health may be directly implicated. Dosing is done in wet processes with dosing pumps but even more importantly in dry processes, just prior to the packaging of the product. Dosing of dry materials is commonly done through Gain-in-Weight dosing or Loss-in-Weight dosing using equipments on load cells.\n\nThe feeding of chemicals in agriculture has also become common due to technology developments. However agricultural dosing is done by means of hand held pressure spray pumps.\n\nSometimes aerial spraying of chemicals by fixed quantities at intervals or dosing is also adopted for agricultural spraying or for atmospheric spraying for eliminating certain types of harmful insects.\n"}
{"id": "973115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=973115", "title": "Enrique of Malacca", "text": "Enrique of Malacca\n\nEnrique of Malacca (; ; Malay known as Panglima Awang), who participated in the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan's mission in the 16th century to sail around the world. Italian historian Antonio Pigafetta, who wrote the most comprehensive account of Magellan's voyage, named him \"Henrique\" (which was Hispanicised as \"Enrique\" in official Spanish documents). Pigafetta explicitly states that \"Henrique\" was a native of Sumatra. According to biographer-philosopher Stefan Zweig, he is the first person to circumnavigate the world. His name appears as \"Henrique\", which is Portuguese, and is probably the name given to him at his christening, as he was baptised a Roman Catholic by his Portuguese captors. His name appears only in Pigafetta's account, in Magellan's Last Will, and in official documents at the \"Casa de Contratación de las Indias\" of the Magellan expedition to the Philippines.\n\nAs set out in Magellan's document Last Will, Magellan acquired Enrique as a slave at Malacca, most probably at the early stages of the siege by the Portuguese in 1511, at age 14 years.\n\nEnrique's baptism is attested by Magellan himself in his will, in which he states that Enrique was a Christian. Magellan also explicitly mentions that Enrique was a native of Malacca. Eyewitness documents of Antonio Pigafetta, Ginés de Mafra, the Genoese pilot, Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, Juan Sebastián Elcano, and Bartolomé de las Casas, and secondary sources such as João de Barros and Francisco López de Gómara, refer to him as a slave.\n\nEnrique accompanied Magellan back to Europe, and onwards on Magellan's search for a westward passage to the East Indies, and he served as an interpreter for the Spaniards. Bergreen 2002 cites Magellan's claim to the Spanish court that his slave Enrique was a native of the Spice Islands; Magellan produced letters from a Portuguese acquaintance, Francisco Serrão, who located the Spice Islands so far to the east of Spain, that they lay in the area granted to Spain, rather than Portugal; in other words, the Earth was round. This gave Spain an opportunity to claim the Spice Islands.\n\nGinés de Mafra explicitly states in his first hand account that Enrique was taken on the expedition primarily because of his ability to speak the Malay language: \"He [Magellan] told his men that they were now in the land he had desired, and sent a man named Herédia, who was the ship's clerk, ashore with a Native they had taken, so they said, because he was known to speak Malay, the language spoken in the Malay Archipelago.\" The island in the Philippines where Enrique spoke and was understood by the natives was Mazaua, which Mafra locates somewhere near Mindanao.\n\nMagellan had provided in his will that Enrique was to be freed upon his death. But after the battle, the remaining ships' masters refused this bequest. \n\nThe Genoese pilot of the Magellan expedition, states — wrongly — in his eye-witness account that the Spaniards had no interpreter when they arrived back to Cebu, because Enrique had died on Mactan along with Magellan during the Battle of Mactan in 1521. However, Enrique was very much alive on 1 May 1521, and attended a feast given by Rajah Humabon to the Spaniards. Antonio Pigafetta writes that the survivor João Serrão, who was pleading with the crew from the shore to save him from the Cebuano tribesmen, said that all those who went to the banquet were slain, except for Enrique. A discourse by Giovanni Battista Ramusio claims that Enrique warned the Chief of Subuth that the Spaniards were plotting to capture the king and that this led to the murder of Serrão and others at the banquet.\n\nEnrique accompanied Magellan on all his voyages, including the voyage that circumnavigated the world between 1519 and 1521. On 1 May he left in Cebu, with the presumed intention to return to his home island, and there is nothing more said of Enrique in any document.\n\nIf he succeeded in returning to his home, he would have been the first person to circumnavigate the world and return to his starting point. The official and generally accepted view is that Elcano and his sailors were the first, according to Maximilianus Transylvanus and Antonio Pigafetta documents. Enrique is only documented to have travelled with Magellan from Malacca to Cebu, 2500 km and 20 degrees of longitude short of completing the circumnavigation. It is not known if he ever had a chance to complete it.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "906471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=906471", "title": "Fibrosis", "text": "Fibrosis\n\nFibrosis is the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue in a reparative or reactive process. This can be a reactive, benign, or pathological state. In response to injury, this is called scarring, and if fibrosis arises from a single cell line, this is called a fibroma. Physiologically, fibrosis acts to deposit connective tissue, which can interfere with or totally inhibit the normal architecture and function of the underlying organ or tissue. Fibrosis can be used to describe the pathological state of excess deposition of fibrous tissue, as well as the process of connective tissue deposition in healing. Defined by the pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, fibrosis results in scarring and thickening of the affected tissue, it is in essence an exaggerated wound healing response which interferes with normal organ function.\n\nFibrosis is similar to the process of scarring, in that both involve stimulated fibroblasts laying down connective tissue, including collagen and glycosaminoglycans. The process is initiated when immune cells such as macrophages release soluble factors that stimulate fibroblasts. The most well characterized pro-fibrotic mediator is TGF beta, which is released by macrophages as well as any damaged tissue between surfaces called interstitium. Other soluble mediators of fibrosis include CTGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and Interleukin 4 (IL-4). These initiate signal transduction pathways such as the AKT/mTOR and SMAD pathways that ultimately lead to the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts, which deposit extracellular matrix into the surrounding connective tissue. This process of tissue repair is a complex one, with tight regulation of ECM synthesis and degradation ensuring maintenance of normal tissue architecture. However, the entire process, although necessary, can lead to a progressive irreversible fibrotic response if tissue injury is severe or repetitive, or if the wound healing response itself becomes deregulated.\n\nFibrosis can occur in many tissues within the body, typically as a result of inflammation or damage, and examples include:\n\nLungs\nLiver\nHeart\nBrain\nOther\n\n"}

{"id": "10956960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10956960", "title": "Information and media literacy", "text": "Information and media literacy\n\nInformation and media literacy (IML) enables people to interpret and make informed judgments as users of information and media, as well as to become skillful creators and producers of information and media messages in their own right.\n\nPrior to the 1990s, the primary focus of information literacy was research skills. Media literacy, a study that emerged around the 1970s, traditionally focuses on the analysis and the delivery of information through various forms of media. Nowadays, the study of information literacy has been extended to include the study of media literacy in many countries like the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The term \"information and media literacy\" is used by UNESCO to differentiate the combined study from the existing study of information literacy. It is also referred to as information and communication technologies (ICT) in the United States. Educators such as Gregory Ulmer have also defined the field as electracy.\n\nIML is a combination of information literacy and media literacy. The purpose of being information and media literate is to engage in a digital society; one needs to be able to understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically. It is important to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms. The transformative nature of IML includes creative works and creating new knowledge; to publish and collaborate responsibly requires ethical, cultural and social understanding.\n\nThe IML learning capacities prepare students to be 21st century literate. According to Jeff Wilhelm (2000), \"technology has everything to do with literacy. And being able to use the latest electronic technologies has everything to do with being literate.\" He supports his argument with J. David Bolter's statement that \"if our students are not reading and composing with various electronic technologies, then they are illiterate. They are not just unprepared for the future; they are illiterate right now, in our current time and context\".\n\nWilhelm's statement is supported by the 2005 Wired World Phase II (YCWW II) survey conducted by the Media Awareness Network of Canada on 5000 Grade 4 – 11 students. The key findings of the survey were:\n\nMarc Prensky (2001) uses the term \"digital native\" to describe people who have been brought up in a digital world. The Internet has been a pervasive element of young people's home lives. 94% of kids reported that they had Internet access at home, and a significant majority (61%) had a high-speed connection.\n\nBy the time kids reach Grade 11, half of them (51 percent) have their own Internet-connected computer, separate and apart from the family computer. The survey also showed that young Canadians are now among the most wired in the world. Contrary to the earlier stereotype of the isolated and awkward computer nerd, today's wired kid is a social kid.\n\nIn general, many students are better networked through the use of technology than most teachers and parents, who may not understand the abilities of technology. Students are no longer limited to desktop computera. They may use mobile technologies to graph mathematical problems, research a question for social studies, text message an expert for information, or send homework to a drop box. Students are accessing information by using MSN, personal Web pages, Weblogs and social networking sites.\n\nMany teachers continue the tradition of teaching of the past 50 years. Traditionally teachers have been the experts sharing their knowledge with children. Technology, and the learning tools it provides access to, forces us to change to being facilitators of learning. We have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information, and students as consumers of information, in order to meet the needs of digital students. Teachers not only need to learn to speak digital, but also to embrace the language of digital natives.\n\nLanguage is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information. Digital natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices. People born prior to 1988 are sometimes referred to as \"digital immigrants.\" They experience difficulty programming simple devices like a VCR. Digital immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work.\n\nLearning a language is best done early in a child's development.\n\nIn acquiring a second language, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of 6 and 7 seemed to be a cut-off point for bilinguals to achieve native-like proficiency. After that age, second language learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would, while consisting of very few actual errors, have enough errors that would set them apart from the first language group.\n\nKindergarten and grades 1 and 2 are critical to student success as digital natives because not all students have a \"digital\"-rich childhood. Students learning technological skills before Grade 3 can become equivalently bilingual. \"Language-minority students who cannot read and write proficiently in English cannot participate fully in American schools, workplaces, or society. They face limited job opportunities and earning power.\" Speaking \"digital\" is as important as being literate in order to participate fully in North American society and opportunities.\n\nMany students are considered illiterate in media and information for various reasons. They may not see the value of media and information literacy in the 21st-century classroom. Others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information. Educators need to introduce IML to these students to help them become media and information literate. Very little changes will be made if the educators are not supporting information and media literacy in their own classrooms.\n\nPerformance standards, the foundation to support them, and tools to implement them are readily available. Success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established. Shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary.\n\nWhen the staff and community, working together, identify and clarify their values, beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do, an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved. Using the capacity tools to assess IML will allow students, staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology.\n\nThe IML Performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student-learning needs are being met. After assessing student IML, three questions can be asked:\n\n\nTeachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support. Students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves.\n\nThis integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as technical communication tools. In addition, recent learning pedagogy recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has been developing a standard IML curriculum for the US and other countries by implementing the National Educational Technology Standards.\n\nIn the UK, IML has been promoted among educators through an information literacy website developed by several organizations that have been involved in the field.\n\nIML is included in the Partnership for the 21st Century program sponsored by the US Department of Education. Special mandates have been provided to Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Individual school districts, such as the Clarkstown Central School District, have also developed their own information literacy curriculum. ISTE has also produced the National Educational Technology Standards for Students, Teachers and Administrators.\n\nIn British Columbia, Canada, the Ministry of Education has de-listed the Information Technology K to 7 IRP as a stand-alone course. It is still expected that all the prescribed learning outcomes continue to be integrated.\n\nThis integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as technical communication tools. In addition, recent learning pedagogy recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. Unfortunately, there has been no clear direction to implement IML.\n\nThe BC Ministry of Education published the Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI in 2005. These standards provide performance standards expectations for Grade 5 to 10; however, they do not provide guidance for other grades, and the expectation for a Grade 5 and Grade 10 student are the same.\n\nIn the Arab region, media and information literacy was largely ignored up until 2011, when the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut, the Open Society Foundations and the Arab-US Association for Communication Educators (AUSACE) launched a regional conference themed \"New Directions: Digital and Media Literacy\". The conference attracted significant attention from Arab universities and scholars, who discussed obstacles and needs to advance media literacy in the Arab region, including developing curricula in Arabic, training faculty and promoting the field. \n\nFollowing up on that recommendation, the Media Studies Program at AUB and the Open Society Foundations in collaboration with the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change launched in 2013 the first regional initiative to develop, vitalize, and advance media literacy education in the Arab region. The Media and Digital Literacy Academy of Beirut (MDLAB) offered an annual two-week summer training program in addition to working year-round to develop media literacy curricula and programs. The academy is conducted in Arabic and English and brings pioneering international instructors and professionals to teach advanced digital and media literacy concepts to young Arab academics and graduate students from various fields. MDLAB hopes that the participating Arab academics will carry what they learned to their countries and institutions and offers free curricular material in Arabic and English, including media literacy syllabi, lectures, exercises, lesson plans, and multi-media material, to assist and encourage the integration of digital and media literacy into Arab university and school curricula. \n\nIn recognition of MDLAB's accomplishments in advancing media literacy education in the Arab region, the founder of MDLAB received the 2015 UNESCO-UNAOC International Media and Information Literacy Award. \n\nPrior to 2013, only two Arab universities offered media literacy courses: the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the American University of Sharjah (AUS). Three years after the launch of MDLAB, over two dozen Arab universities incorporated media literacy education into their curricula, both as stand-alone courses or as modules injected into their existing media courses. Among the universities who have full-fledged media literacy courses (as of 2015) are Lebanese American University (Lebanon), Birzeit University (Palestine), University of Balamand (Lebanon), Damascus University (Syria), Rafik Hariri University (Lebanon), Notre Dame University (Lebanon), Ahram Canadian University (Egypt), American University of Beirut (Lebanon), American University of Sharjah (UAE), and Al Azm University (Lebanon). The first Arab school to adopt media literacy as part of its strategic plan is the International College (IC) in Lebanon. Efforts to introduce media literacy to the region's other universities and schools continues with the help of other international organizations, such as UNESCO, UNAOC, AREACORE, DAAD, and OSF.\n\nIn Singapore and Hong Kong, information literacy or information technology was listed as a formal curriculum.\n\nOne barrier to learning to read is the lack of books, while a barrier to learning IML is the lack of technology access. Highlighting the value of IML helps to identify existing barriers within school infrastructure, staff development, and support systems. While there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access, the biggest obstacle is school climate.\n\nMarc Prensky identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions: \"Let's admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that, given the opportunity to use them, students would vote with their attention, just as adults would 'vote with their feet' by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling.\"\n\nThe mindset of banning new technology, and fearing the bad things that can happen, can affect educational decisions. The decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives.\n\nAny tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe. Safety lessons are mandatory in industrial technology and science. Yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology.\n\nNot all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs. One school district in Ontario banned digital devices from their schools. Local schools have been looking at doing the same. These kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and not about teaching, learning or creating solutions. Many barriers to IML exist.\n\n"}

A number of non-official, minority languages and dialects are spoken as well.\n\nThe Belgium Constitution guarantees, since the country's independence, freedom of language in the private sphere. Article 30 specifies that \"the use of languages spoken in Belgium is optional; only the law can rule on this matter, and only for acts of the public authorities and for legal matters.\" For those public authorities, there is extensive language legislation concerning Dutch, French and German, even though the Belgian Constitution does not explicitly mention which languages enjoy official status. Article 4 does however divide the country into linguistic areas, which form the basis of the federal structure: \"Belgium has four linguistic areas: The French-speaking area, the Dutch-speaking area, the bilingual area of Brussels Capital and the German-speaking area.\"\n\nBefore the federal structure and the language legislation gradually introduced in the 20th century, French was generally the only language used by public authorities. For example, the Dutch version of the Constitution has enjoyed equal status to the original French one only since 1967, and the German version only since 1991.\nOf the inhabitants of Belgium, roughly 59% belong to the Flemish Community, 40% to the French Community and 1% to the German-speaking Community, though these figures relating to official Belgian languages include unknown numbers of immigrants and their children speaking a foreign language as primary language, and of Belgian regional migrants which may be assumed to largely balance one another for natively French and Dutch speakers. Though the standard form of Dutch used in Belgium is almost identical to that spoken in the Netherlands and the different dialects spread across the border, it is often colloquially called \"Flemish\".\n\nDutch is the official language of the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region (merged to Flanders) and, along with French, an official language of the Brussels-Capital Region. The main Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium are Brabantian, West Flemish, East Flemish and Limburgish. All these are spoken across the border in the Netherlands as well, and West Flemish is also spoken in French Flanders. Much like English, Flemish dialects have adopted much more French and other Romance vocabulary through mutual cultural exchange throughout history when compared with other Dutch dialects and as such they are not always readily intelligible for Dutch speakers outside Flanders. Words which are unique to Belgian Dutch are called \"belgicisms\" (as are words used primarily in Belgian French). The original Brabantian dialect of Brussels has been very much influenced by French. It is now spoken by a minority in the Capital region since the language of most inhabitants shifted during the Frenchification of Brussels.\n\nThe second-most spoken primary (Belgian) language, used natively by almost 40% of the population, is French. It is the official language of the French Community (which, like the Flemish Community, is a political entity), the dominant language in Wallonia (having also a small German-speaking Community) as well as the Brussels-Capital Region. Almost all of the inhabitants of the Capital region speak French as either their primary language (50%) or as a lingua franca (45%). There are also many Flemish people who speak French as a second language. Belgian French is in most respects identical to standard, Parisian French, but differs in some points of vocabulary, pronunciation, and semantics.\n\nGerman is the least prevalent official language in Belgium, spoken natively by less than 1% of the population. The German-speaking Community of Belgium numbers 77,000, residing in an area of Belgium that was ceded by the former German Empire as part of the Treaty of Versailles, which concluded World War I. In 1940, Nazi Germany re-annexed the region following its invasion of Belgium during World War II; after the war it was returned to Belgium.\n\nIn national politics, politicians can freely choose to speak in any of the three official languages. In turn, the Belgian parliament provides simultaneous interpretation for those who require it to assist in communication.\n\nEducation is provided by the Communities, Dutch in the Flemish Community (Flanders and Brussels), French in the French Community (Wallonia and Brussels), German in the German-speaking community. Instruction in other languages is prohibited in government-funded schools except for foreign language subjects. However, the English language has become increasingly used in higher education.\n\nAlso all official correspondence and communication with the government (e.g. tax papers, local politics, ID/passport requests, building permits etc.) must be in the official language of the region or community. Inhabitants of a few municipalities are granted an exception to these rules.\n\nIn 2006, the Université Catholique de Louvain, the country's largest French-speaking university, published a report with the introduction (translated):\n\nWithin the report, professors in economics Ginsburgh and Weber further show that of the Brussels' residents, 95% declared they can speak French, 59% Dutch, and 41% know the non-local English. Of those under the age of forty, 59% in Flanders declared that they could speak all three, along with 10% in Wallonia and 28% in Brussels. In each region, Belgium's third official language, German, is notably less known than those.\n\nIn addition to the three official languages, others are spoken in Belgium, like in Wallonia, where French became dominant only relatively recently. Sometimes seen as dialects, the varieties related to French have been recognized by the French Community as separate languages (\"\", ‘regional native languages’) since 1990, without, however, taking any further significant measures to support those varieties.\n\nWalloon is the historical language of southern Belgium, and most of the areas where French is now spoken were Walloon-speaking. It is also the traditional national language of the Walloons. Though it has been recognized, like other vernaculars in Belgium, since 1990, it is mainly spoken by older people, though younger Walloons may claim some knowledge. It is mainly used in rural regions, and is used in theaters and literature, though not in schools.\n\nAnother language related to French, and a historic language of the region, Picard, was recognized by the government of the French Community in 1990. Western Belgium has its core area in France, stretching into the western part of Wallonia.\n\nChampenois was also legally recognized in 1990. It is mainly spoken in Champagne, France, and a small part of Wallonia.\n\nLike the other indigenous languages closely related to French, Lorrain was recognized in 1990. It is mainly spoken in Gaume, a part of Belgian Lorraine.\n\nFlanders too has a number of dialects, but linguists regard these as varieties of Dutch rather than a separate Flemish language with the exception of Limburgish and West Flemish. The main Dutch dialects in Belgium are Brabantian and East Flemish. Standard Dutch, as spoken in Belgium, is mostly influenced by Brabantian. There are literary traditions in both the East Flemish and West Flemish dialects.\n\nLimburgish is a language spoken mainly in north-eastern Belgium and the south-eastern Netherlands, in the Belgian and Dutch provinces of Limburg. It is closely related to Dutch but has more German influences.\n\nLow Dietsch is a Germanic language or dialect in the north-east of the Belgian province of Liege, in the kernel area of the historical (and linguistically mixed) Duchy of Limburg. It is spoken in towns and villages such as Plombières \"(Bleiberg)\", Gemmenich, Hombourg, Montzen and Welkenraedt. By linguists, the variety is classified as a transition between Limburgish and Ripuarian. It has been defined as either varieties of Dutch or of German. Low Dietsch is acknowledged as an internal regional language by the Walloon authority since 1992. The Low Dietsch was the favorite foreign language of Andrew Jackson for its sound and eloquency. Low Dietsch is practically identical to the German dialect in the northern part of the neighbouring official German-speaking region of Belgium. The different definition is due to the fact that the German-speaking region was annexed by Belgium in 1919, whereas the \"Low Dietsch\" area has been part of Belgium since 1830.\n\nLuxembourgish, a Moselle Franconian language formerly regarded as a variety of German, is native to Arelerland, the eastern part of the Belgian province of Luxembourg, including the city of Arlon \"(Arel)\". Here it has largely been replaced by Belgian French in recent decades, contrarily to its flourishing on the other side of the border, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nThe language has, since 1990, been recognised by the Walloon authorities as \"\" (Franconian). It was the only non-Romance language recognized in the 1990 decree.\n\nYiddish is spoken by many among the 20,000 Ashkenazi Jews living in Antwerp. The Yiddish community there is among the strongest in Europe, and one of the few Jewish communities worldwide in which Yiddish remains the dominant language (others include Kiryas Joel, New York, and similar Ashkenazi neighborhoods in the United States, London, Paris, Montreal and Israel).\n\nLSFB, or French Belgian Sign Language, is used primarily in Wallonia and Brussels and is related to LSF and other Francosign languages. It developed from Old Belgian Sign Language which came about as a result of contact between Lyons Sign Language and LSF.\n\nLike LSFB, Flemish Sign Language, or VGT, is a Francosign language descended from Old Belgian Sign Language which is used primarily in Flanders with five major regional dialects: West Flanders, East Flanders, Antwerp, Flemish Brabant, and Limburg. Moreover, there is dialectal variation between men and women speakers due to historical developments of the language.\n\nUnlike VGT and LSFB, DGS, or German Sign Language, is unrelated to LSF and comprises its own language family. DGS is related to PJM and Shassi. It is primarily used around the German-speaking communities of Belgium, although German and DGS are unrelated.\n\nLanguages spoken by immigrants from recent decades and their descendants include Berber (Riffian), Arabic (Maghrebi), Spanish, Turkish, Portuguese, Italian, Greek, Polish and English.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "584171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=584171", "title": "Old Sparky", "text": "Old Sparky\n\nOld Sparky is the nickname of the electric chairs in Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. Old Smokey was the nickname of the electric chairs used in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. \n\"Old Sparky\" is sometimes used to refer to electric chairs in general, and not one of a specific state.\n\nConnecticut legislated lethal injection as its sole method of execution in 1995. The last person executed by electrocution was Joseph \"Mad Dog\" Taborsky in May 1960. Connecticut's \"Old Sparky\" has not been tested since it was moved from Wethersfield to the Northern Correctional Institution in Somers in 1962, and prison officials claim the prison's electrical system cannot handle it.\n\nIt was the sole means of execution in Florida from 1924 until 2000, when the Florida State Legislature, under pressure from the U.S. Supreme Court, signed lethal injection into law. Although no one has been executed in this manner since 1999, prisoners awaiting execution on Florida's death row may still be electrocuted at their request. It is currently located in Florida State Prison on the outskirts of Starke. It was notorious for frequent malfunctions in the 1990s, namely in the cases of Jesse Tafero (executed May 4, 1990), Pedro Medina (executed March 25, 1997) and Allen Lee Davis (executed July 8, 1999). Reportedly, six-inch flames shot out of Tafero's head and 12-inch flames shot out of Medina's head, raising the question whether use of the electric chair was cruel and unusual punishment. After the Medina execution, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth commented, \"People who wish to commit murder, they'd better not do it in the state of Florida because we may have a problem with the electric chair.\"\n\nThe malfunctions were probably due to practices of the prison staff and not because of the electric chair itself. The wooden chair had been replaced in early 1999 to accommodate Davis's girth. The electrical components remained the same for the system.\n\nTo assure proper contact between the inmate's head and the electrode, a saline-soaked sponge stuffed between the two was necessary. In the Tafero incident, a natural sponge was replaced with a synthetic sponge that caught fire during the execution. In the Medina incident, prison officials apparently did not properly soak the sponge in saline and it caught fire as well. Photographs that surfaced after Davis's execution clearly showed that his nose had been severely compressed by a misfitted head strap.\n\nThe 1999 execution of Allen Lee Davis incited outrage after witnesses saw his white shirt rapidly turn red with blood during his execution. Prison officials later determined the blood came from an unusually profuse nosebleed most likely caused by an improperly fitted head strap. The source of the blood was not evident to witnesses during execution, because Davis's head was covered with a traditional hood. A prison inspector general took photographs of Davis's body, still bloody and strapped in the chair, shortly after execution. These photographs later became key evidence in several cases mounting yet another challenge to the constitutionality of the electric chair. These lawsuits ultimately came to the Florida Supreme Court in the fall of 1999, when a bare majority (4 of the 7 Justices) found that the electric chair was constitutional in a case brought by death row inmate Thomas Provenzano. One of the dissenting Justices, Leander J. Shaw, Jr., took the extraordinary step of attaching to his opinion three color photographs of Davis's bloody body strapped in the chair. This publication marked the first time those photographs had surfaced on the Internet or, for that matter, anywhere outside court and prison files.\n\nThe effect was to create an immediate and sometimes macabre international debate over capital punishment in general and Florida's adherence to electrocution in particular. The Florida Supreme Court's web servers repeatedly crashed under the demand for access to the photographs, reputed to be the first actual photographs of an American state execution in decades. The photos were used during a protest demonstration in Madrid in support of a Spaniard on Florida's death row. Some death penalty supporters in the United States viewed the photographs as a deterrent, apparently believing they had been posted on the Website as a warning to all potentially dangerous criminals.\n\nSome Florida politicians vowed never to eliminate the electric chair despite the debate, but events rapidly changed after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal from the Florida Supreme Court's split decision upholding electrocution. This action shocked some in Florida's leadership. The nation's high court had declined to review appeals after the prior three malfunctions, so observers concluded that the nation's high court now had come to view Florida's death penalty problems more dimly. Partly on the advice of Attorney General Butterworth, Florida's Governor Jeb Bush summoned the legislature into special session and in early 2000 it quickly approved lethal injection as the means of execution that must be used unless the inmate requests electrocution. The Attorney General then notified the Federal court and it agreed to dismiss the case based on the change in law.\n\nGeorgia's electric chair, known as \"Old Sparky\", located at Georgia State Prison was installed in 1924 following the state's abolition of hanging and was the sole method of execution in Georgia until October 25, 2001. The original chair, which was painted white, was replaced in 1980 and sent from the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center back to Reidsville, while a squat, varnished replacement was constructed to replace it. Between 1924 and 1998, Georgia electrocuted 441 prisoners. Today the original chair is on public display at Georgia State Prison, while its replacement is situated in a closet near the death chamber at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center. It was famously used in the 1945 execution of Lena Baker. In 1996, Georgia State Representative Doug Teper unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to replace the state's electric chair with a guillotine in order to facilitate the use of the condemned prisoners' remains in organ donation.\n\nKentucky's electric chair, known as \"Old Sparky\", is located at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville, Kentucky. It was first used on July 8, 1911; the first inmate to die in the chair was James Buckner, convicted of killing a police officer several weeks earlier. On July 13, 1928, Kentucky set a record by electrocuting eight men in its chair, each immediately after the other, more than any other state has electrocuted in a single day. The state has decommissioned the electric chair except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31, 1998 and choose death by electrocution rather than death by lethal injection or if lethal injection is declared unconstitutional by a court. Prior to this legislated date, 163 deaths had occurred in Kentucky's electric chair. The last such execution by electric chair occurred on July 1, 1997, when convicted murderer Harold McQueen was executed in it.\n\nIn 1887, New York State established a committee to determine a new, more humane system of execution to replace hanging. Alfred P. Southwick, a member of the committee, developed the idea of putting electric current through a device after hearing about how relatively painlessly and quickly a drunken man died after touching exposed power lines. As Southwick was a dentist accustomed to performing procedures on sitting subjects, his electrical device appeared in the form of a chair.\n\nOn June 4, 1888, Governor David B. Hill authorized the introduction of the electric chair. It was first used two years later when William Kemmler became the first person in the world to be executed by electricity at Auburn Prison, Auburn, New York on August 6, 1890.\n\n\"Old Sparky\" was first used at Sing Sing prison for a mass execution on July 7, 1891. The order of execution, which would start at 4:30 a.m., was listed as James J. Slocum, Harris Smiler, Shibuya Jugiro, and Joseph Wood. The chair was situated in a purpose-built building known as the Death House which was a prison within the high-security Sing Sing prison. The block, which had its own hospital, kitchen, visiting room, and exercise yard, had 24 single cells plus an additional three cells for condemned women. A chamber where a prisoner spent their last day was nicknamed the \"Dance Hall\". A corridor, known as the \"Last Mile\", connected the ante-room to the execution chamber.\n\nExecutions at Sing Sing were traditionally carried out at 11 p.m. on Thursdays. Condemned prisoners would be brought into the execution room escorted by seven guards and the prison chaplain. Already waiting in the room would be the warden of Sing Sing, the state electrician, two doctors and twelve state appointed witnesses. After the condemned prisoner was strapped into the chair and the electrodes attached, the warden would step forward and read out the final decision on the sentence. The prisoner would be asked for any last words or for a benediction. With a signal, the execution would then begin. Witnesses would leave once both doctors had confirmed that death had occurred.\n\nIn its 75 years of operation, a total of 695 men and women were executed by the electric chair in New York state (614 at Sing Sing alone). From 1914, all executions were conducted at Sing Sing prison using \"Old Sparky\". Eddie Mays would become the last person to be executed on August 15, 1963. Two years later New York state abolished capital punishment. The state would later reinstate the practice in 1995 using lethal injection, but the practice was abolished again in 2004, after the Court of Appeals ruled in \"People v. LaValle\" that it violated the state constitution. No inmates were executed during the nine years that capital punishment was reinstated in New York.\n\nOhio was the second state to adopt the electric chair as a means of execution, executing 315 people between 1897 and its last use was in 1963. The state stopped using the electric chair in 2001, and now exclusively utilizes lethal injection in executions. Ohio's Old Sparky is now a museum exhibit in the Ohio State Reformatory.\n\nThe state installed the \"Old Sparky\" in 1912 at the Central Correctional Institution (CCI) in Columbia. In 1944 it was used to execute 14-year-old George Stinney, the youngest person to be sentenced to death in the United States for more than a century. In 1990 the chair was relocated to the newly built Broad River Correctional Institution. It is managed by the South Carolina Department of Corrections.\n\nIn 1997 all death row inmates were relocated from Broad River to the Lieber Correctional Institution. The move provided better management controls and ensured correctional staff who dealt with condemned prisoners on a daily basis were not the same officers given the responsibility of carrying out the death sentence.\n\nThe most recent use of \"Old Sparky\" was in June 21, 2008 when convicted murderer James Earl Reed opted for this method of execution.\n\nThe Texas electric chair to which the name \"Old Sparky\" is applied was in use from 1924 to 1964. During that time, it saw the deaths of 361 prisoners sentenced to die by judicial electrocution. It was built by incarcerated craftsmen in 1924. Following its decommissioning, it was originally relegated to a prison dump before being rescued. Today, it is on public display as part of a replica death chamber at the Texas Prison Museum in Huntsville, Texas, along with tubing and straps used in Texas' first execution by lethal injection.\n\nIn 1971, the Greater Dallas Crime Commission, a business organization, circulated a petition to recommission Texas' \"Old Sparky\". The petition received 10,620 endorsements.\n\nThe now-decommissioned electric chair known as \"Old Sparky\" at the now-closed West Virginia State Penitentiary in Moundsville, West Virginia was installed in a facility originally used for hanging. It was in use from 1951 until 1959, during which time nine condemned prisoners were executed in the chair. The chair was bolted to a low platform which covered what had previously been the trapdoor of the gallows used in the state's judicial hangings. Its control apparatus was designed in such a way that three push-button switches were to be simultaneously pressed by three members of the execution team; only one of these switches actually completed the circuit, allowing each member of the execution team to reassure himself that perhaps he had not been the one who had actually initiated the death of the condemned.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21392957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21392957", "title": "Phototaxis", "text": "Phototaxis\n\nPhototaxis is a kind of taxis, or locomotory movement, that occurs when a whole organism moves towards or away from stimulus of light. This is advantageous for phototrophic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for photosynthesis. Phototaxis is called positive if the movement is in the direction of increasing light intensity and negative if the direction is opposite.\n\nTwo types of positive phototaxis are observed in prokaryotes. The first is called scotophobotaxis (from the word \"scotophobia\"), which is observed only under a microscope. This occurs when a bacterium swims by chance out of the area illuminated by the microscope. Entering darkness signals the cell to reverse flagella rotation direction and reenter the light. The second type of phototaxis is true phototaxis, which is a directed movement up a gradient to an increasing amount of light. This is analogous to positive chemotaxis except that the attractant is light rather than a chemical.\n\nPhototactic responses are observed in many organisms such as \"Serratia marcescens\", \"Tetrahymena\", and \"Euglena\". Each organism has its own specific biological cause for a phototactic response, many of which are incidental and serve no end purpose.\n\nPhototaxis in zooplankton is well studied in the marine annelid \"Platynereis dumerilii\":\n\n\"Platynereis dumerilii\" trochophore and metatrochophore larvae are positively phototactic. Phototaxis there is mediated by simple eyespots that consists of a pigment cell and a photoreceptor cell. The photoreceptor cell synapses directly onto ciliated cells, which are used for swimming. The eyespots do not give spatial resolution, therefore the larvae are rotating to scan their environment for the direction where the light is coming from.\n\n\"Platynereis dumerilii\" nectochaete larvae can switch between positive and negative phototaxis. Phototaxis there is mediated by two pairs of more complex pigment cup eyes. These eyes contain more photoreceptor cells that are shaded by pigment cells forming a cup. The photoreceptor cells do not synapse directly onto ciliated cells or muscle cells but onto inter-neurons of a processing center. This way the information of all four eye cups can be compared and a low resolution image of four pixels can be created telling the larvae where the light is coming from. This way the larva does not need to scan its environment by rotating. This is an adaption for living on the bottom of the sea the life style of the nectochaete larva while scanning rotation is more suited for living in the open water column, the life style of the trochophore larva. Phototaxis in the \"Platynereis dumerilii\" nectochaete larva has a broad spectral range which is at least covered by three opsins that are expressed by the cup eyes: Two rhabdomeric opsins and a Go-opsin.\n\nHowever, not every behavior that looks like phototaxis is phototaxis: \"Platynereis dumerilii\" nechtochate and metatrochophore larvae swim up first when they are stimulated with UV-light from above. But after a while, they change the direction and avoid the UV-light by swimming down. This looks like a change from positive to negative phototaxis (see video left), but the larvae also swim down if UV-light comes non-directionally from the side. And so they do not swim to or away from the light, but swim down, this means to the center of gravity. Thus this is a UV-induced positive gravitaxis. Positive phototaxis (swimming to the light from the surface) and positive gravitaxis (swimming to the center of gravity) are induced by different ranges of wavelengths and cancel out each other at a certain ratio of wavelengths. Since the wavelengths compositions change in water with depth: Short (UV, violet) and long (red) wavelengths are lost first, phototaxis and gravitaxis form a ratio-chromatic depth gauge, which allows the larvae to determine their depth by the color of the surrounding water. This has the advantage over a brightness based depth gauge that the color stays almost constant independent of the time of the day or whether it is cloudy.\n\nPositive and negative phototactic behaviour can be found in several species of jellyfish such as species from the polyorchis genus. Jellyfish utilize ocelli to detect the presence and absence of light, which is then translated into anti-predatory behaviour in the case of a shadow being cast over the ocelli, or feeding behaviour in the case of the presence of light. Many tropical jellyfish contain photosynthetic zooxanthellae within their cells and have a symbiotic relationship. The jellyfish receives nourishment, provides protection, and locomotion toward light sources such as the sun to provide the greatest exposure to the light. In the presence of a shadow the jellyfish can either remain still, or perform a quick burst of movement to avoid predation and also readjust toward a new light source.\n\nThis motor response to light and absence of light of is facilitated by a chemical response from the ocelli, which results in a motor response causing the organism to swim toward a light source.\n\nPositive phototactic behaviour in insects can be found primarily in insects capable of flight such as many species of flies, moths, and grasshoppers. \"Drosophila melanogaster\" has been studied extensively on its innate positive phototactic response to light sources using controlled experiments to help understand the connection between airborne locomotion toward a light source. This innate response is common among insects that fly primarily during the night utilizing transverse orientation with the light of the moon to fly. Artificial lights in cities and populated areas result in a more bright and positive response compared to the distant light of the moon, resulting in the organism repeatedly responding to this new supernormal stimulus and innately flying toward it.\n\nEvidence for the innate response of positive phototactic behaviour in \"Drosophila melanogaster\" was carried out by altering the wings of several individuals both physically via removal, or genetically via mutation. In all cases the organisms with wings removed and wings mutated there was a noticeable lack of positive phototactic behaviour demonstrating flying toward light is an innate response to the organisms photoreceptors receiving a positive response.\n\nNegative phototaxis can be observed in larval \"drosophila melanogaster\" within the first three developmental instars despite the adult insect displaying positive phototaxis. This behaviour is common among other species of insects which possess a flightless larval and adult stage in their life cycles, only switching to positive phototactic behaviour when searching for pupation sites. \"Tenebrio molitor\" is once such species which carries its negative phototactic behaviour into adulthood.\n\nUnder experimental conditions organisms that utilize positive phototactic behaviour have also shown correlation with light and magnetic fields. Under homogeneous light conditions with a shifting magnetic field \"drosophila melanogaster\" larva reorient themselves toward predicted directions of greater or lesser light intensities as expected by a rotating magnetic field. In complete darkness the same organism orients randomly without any notable preference. This suggests a visible pattern can be observed by the organism in combination with light.\n\n\n"}

Of these, Pite Sami shows closest affinity to Lule Sami, but a number of features also show similarity to Ume and Southern Sami.\n\nThe Pite Sami consonant inventory is very similar to that found in neighbouring Lule Sami, but lacks contrastive voicing of stops and affricates entirely.\n\n\nThe Pite Sami vowel inventory has a relative lack of phonemic diphthongs, compared to other Sami languages and particularly neighbouring Lule Sami. Instead, there are more vowel height distinctions.\n\n\nSammallahti divides Lule Sami dialects as follows:\n\n\nFeatures of the northern dialects are:\n\nFeatures of the southern dialects are:\n\nPite Sámi is one of the four Sami languages that does not have an official written language.

Since June 2015, she has been Bishop of Gloucester, the first female diocesan bishop in the Church of England. From 2011 until 2015, she was the Archdeacon of Hackney in the Diocese of London.\n\nTreweek was born Rachel Montgomery on 4 February 1963. She was educated at Broxbourne School, a state school in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. She studied at the University of Reading and graduated in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in linguistics and language pathology.\n\nTreweek's first career was as a speech and language therapist. After six years as a paediatric speech therapist in the National Health Service, she left her job to begin training for ordination in the Church of England.\n\nTreweek studied for ordained ministry at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, an Anglican theological college, and graduated with a Bachelor of Theology (BTh) degree in 1994. She was made a deacon at Petertide 1994 (3 July), by David Hope, Bishop of London, at St Paul's Cathedral, and ordained a priest the following Petertide (27 June 1995), by Martin Wharton, Bishop of Kingston, at her title church. From 1994 to 1997, she served a curacy at St George and All Saints Church, Tufnell Park, London. From 1997 to 1999, she remained at St George and All Saints Church as the associate vicar. In 1999, she was appointed vicar of St James-the-Less, Bethnal Green, London. In addition to the incumbency, she was appointed the continuing ministerial education officer for the Diocese of London.\n\nIn 2006, Treweek left parish ministry on her appointment as the Archdeacon of Northolt; this made her one of six archdeacons in the Diocese of London. She held the position for five years before becoming the Archdeacon of Hackney on 14 May 2011. She relinquished this appointment on confirmation of her appointment as Bishop of Gloucester on 15 June 2015.\n\nIn September 2013, Treweek was elected as one of eight \"participant observers\" of the House of Bishops as the observer representing the South East of England. The observers are senior priests who are women and who will attend and participate in meetings of the House of Bishops until six women sit in the House by right as bishops. She attended her first meeting of the House of Bishops of the General Synod of the Church of England on 9 December 2013.\n\nOn 26 March 2015, it was announced that Treweek was to become the next Bishop of Gloucester, the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Gloucester. Though there have been two women appointed bishops previously, she is the first woman to be appointed a diocesan bishop, rather than as a suffragan bishop. She was the first woman to become a bishop in the Province of Canterbury, jointly with Sarah Mullally, Bishop of Crediton. On 15 June 2015, her election was confirmed during a sitting of the Arches Court of Canterbury at St Mary-le-Bow, City of London. At this point, she legally became the Bishop of Gloucester. On 22 July 2015, she was consecrated a bishop by Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, during a ceremony at Canterbury Cathedral. She and Sarah Mullally (later Bishop of London) were the first women to be ordained as bishops at Canterbury Cathedral. On 19 September, she was installed at Gloucester Cathedral as the 41st Bishop of Gloucester.\n\nFollowing the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015, she was to become the first woman to enter the House of Lords as a bishop and Lord Spiritual as soon as a Lord Spiritual seat was emptied. She became eligible to take her seat when parliament reconvened in September 2015 after its summer recess and took the seat vacated by Tim Stevens (former Bishop of Leicester and Convenor of the Bishops in the Lords). She sent back the first version of her writ of summons because it referred to her as a “right reverend father in God” (bishops' writs have simply omitted “father in God” ever since — even for male bishops). On 26 October 2015, she was introduced to the House by Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Richard Chartres, Bishop of London.\n\nTreweek believes that God should be considered to be neither male nor female and tries to avoid using gender-specific pronouns when referring to God. Explaining this view, \"she said she personally prefers to say neither \"he\" nor \"she\", but \"God\". \"Sometimes I lapse, but I try not to,\" the bishop told the Observer.\" The Diocese of Gloucester announced that, in January 2017, Treweek would preside at an LGBTI Eucharist with Inclusive Church.\n\nIn 2006, Rachel married Guy Treweek; he is a Church of England priest and was priest-in-charge of two parishes in the City of London at the time of her appointment to the episcopate.\n\nOn 8 July 2016, Treweek was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) degree by the University of Reading, her \"alma mater\".\n\n"}

It is by now supported by very substantial evidence.\n\nIn 2008, Richard Taylor, joint with Laurent Clozel, Michael Harris, and Nicholas Shepherd-Barron, published a proof of the Sato–Tate conjecture for elliptic curves over totally real fields satisfying a certain condition: of having multiplicative reduction at some prime, in a series of three papers.\n\nFurther results are conditional on improved forms of the Arthur–Selberg trace formula. Harris has a conditional proof of a result for the product of two elliptic curves (not isogenous) following from such a hypothetical trace formula. In 2011, Richard Taylor published joint work with Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, and Michael Harris, which claims to prove a generalized version of the Sato–Tate conjecture for an arbitrary non-CM holomorphic modular form of weight greater than or equal to two, by improving the potential modularity results of previous papers. They also assert that the prior issues involved with the trace formula have been solved by Michael Harris, and Sug Woo Shin. \n\nIn 2015, Richard Taylor was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics \"for numerous breakthrough results in (...) the Sato–Tate conjecture.\"\n\nThere are generalisations, involving the distribution of Frobenius elements in Galois groups involved in the Galois representations on étale cohomology. In particular there is a conjectural theory for curves of genus \"n\" > 1.\n\nUnder the random matrix model developed by Nick Katz and Peter Sarnak, there is a conjectural correspondence between (unitarized) characteristic polynomials of Frobenius elements and conjugacy classes in the compact Lie group USp(2\"n\") = Sp(\"n\"). The Haar measure on USp(2\"n\") then gives the conjectured distribution, and the classical case is USp(2) = SU(2).\n\nThere are also more refined statements. The Lang–Trotter conjecture (1976) of Serge Lang and Hale Trotter predicts the asymptotic number of primes \"p\" with a given value of \"a\", the trace of Frobenius that appears in the formula. For the typical case (no complex multiplication, trace ≠ 0) their formula states that the number of \"p\" up to \"X\" is asymptotically\n\nwith a specified constant \"c\". Neal Koblitz (1988) provided detailed conjectures for the case of a prime number \"q\" of points on \"E\", motivated by elliptic curve cryptography.\nIn 1999, Chantal David and Francesco Pappalardi proved that the Lang–Trotter conjecture holds in most cases.\n\n"}

{"id": "562907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=562907", "title": "Sign (semiotics)", "text": "Sign (semiotics)\n\nIn semiotics, a sign is anything that communicates a meaning that is not the sign itself to the interpreter of the sign. The meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the senses, visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or taste.\n\nTwo major theories describe the way signs acquire the ability to transfer information. Both theories understand the defining property of the sign as a relation between a number of elements. In the tradition of semiotics developed by Ferdinand de Saussure (referred to as semiology) the sign relation is dyadic, consisting only of a form of the sign (the signifier) and its meaning (the signified). Saussure saw this relation as being essentially arbitrary (the principle of semiotic arbitrariness), motivated only by social convention. Saussure's theory has been particularly influential in the study of linguistic signs. The other major semiotic theory, developed by C. S. Peirce, defines the sign as a triadic relation as \"something that stands for something, to someone in some capacity\" This means that a sign is a relation between the sign vehicle (the specific physical form of the sign), a sign object (the aspect of the world that the sign carries meaning about) and an interpretant (the meaning of the sign as understood by an interpreter). According to Peirce signs can be divided by the type of relation that holds the sign relation together as either icons, indices or symbols. Icons are those signs that signify by means of similarity between sign vehicle and sign object (e.g. a portrait, or a map), indices are those that signify by means of a direct relation of contiguity or causality between sign vehicle and sign object (e.g. a symptom), and symbols are those that signify through a law or arbitrary social convention.\n\nAccording to Saussure (1857–1913), a sign is composed of the \"signifier\" (\"signifiant\"), and the \"signified\" (\"signifié\"). These cannot be conceptualized as separate entities but rather as a mapping from significant differences in sound to potential (correct) differential denotation. The Saussurean sign exists only at the level of the synchronic system, in which signs are defined by their relative and hierarchical privileges of co-occurrence. It is thus a common misreading of Saussure to take signifiers to be anything one could speak, and signifieds as things in the world. In fact, the relationship of language to parole (or speech-in-context) is and always has been a theoretical problem for linguistics (cf. Roman Jakobson's famous essay \"Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics\" et al.).\n\nA famous thesis by Saussure states that the relationship between a sign and the real-world thing it denotes is an arbitrary one. There is not a natural relationship between a word and the object it refers to, nor is there a causal relationship between the inherent properties of the object and the nature of the sign used to denote it. For example, there is nothing about the physical quality of paper that requires denotation by the phonological sequence ‘paper’. There is, however, what Saussure called ‘relative motivation’: the possibilities of signification of a signifier are constrained by the compositionality of elements in the linguistic system (cf. Emile Benveniste's paper on the arbitrariness of the sign in the first volume of his papers on general linguistics). In other words, a word is only available to acquire a new meaning if it is identifiably \"different\" from all the other words in the language and it has no existing meaning. Structuralism was later based on this idea that it is only within a given system that one can define the distinction between the levels of system and use, or the semantic \"value\" of a sign.\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) proposed a different theory. Unlike Saussure who approached the conceptual question from a study of linguistics and phonology, Peirce, the so-called father of the Pragmatist school of philosophy, extended the concept of sign to embrace many other forms. He considered \"word\" to be only one particular kind of sign, and characterized sign as any mediational means to understanding. He covered not only artificial, linguistic, and symbolic signs, but also all semblances (such as kindred sensible qualities), and all indicators (such as mechanical reactions). He counted as symbols all terms, propositions, and arguments whose interpretation is based upon convention or habit, even apart from their expression in particular languages. He held that \"all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs\". The setting of Peirce's study of signs is philosophical logic, which he defined as formal semiotic, and characterized as a normative field following esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics, and as the art of devising methods of research. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs, that all thought has the form of inference (even when not conscious and deliberate), and that, as inference, \"logic is rooted in the social principle\", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited. The result is a theory not of language in particular, but rather of the production of meaning, and it rejects the idea of a static relationship between a sign and what it represents: its \"object\". Peirce believed that signs are meaningful through recursive relationships that arise in sets of three.\n\nEven when a sign represents by a resemblance or factual connection independent of interpretation, the sign is a sign only insofar as it is at least potentially interpretable by a mind and insofar as the sign is a determination of a mind or at least a \"quasi-mind\", that functions as if it were a mind, for example in crystals and the work of bees—the focus here is on sign action in general, not on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields Peirce also pursued).\n\nA sign depends on an object in a way that enables (and, in a sense, determines) an interpretation, an \"interpretant\", to depend on the object \"as the sign depends on the object\". The interpretant, then, is a further sign of the object, and thus enables and determines still further interpretations, further interpretant signs. The process, called \"semiosis\", is irreducibly triadic, Peirce held, and is logically structured to perpetuate itself. It is what defines sign, object, and interpretant in general. As Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990: 7) put it, \"the process of referring effected by the sign is \"infinite\".\" (Note also that Peirce used the word \"determine\" in the sense not of strict determinism, but of effectiveness that can vary like an influence.)\n\nPeirce further characterized the three semiotic elements as follows:\n\nPeirce explained that signs mediate between their objects and their interpretants in semiosis, the triadic process of determination. In semiosis a \"first\" is determined or influenced to be a sign by a \"second\", as its object. The object determines the sign to determine a \"third\" as an interpretant. \"Firstness\" itself is one of Peirce's three categories of all phenomena, and is quality of feeling. Firstness is associated with a vague state of mind as feeling and a sense of the possibilities, with neither compulsion nor reflection. In semiosis the mind discerns an appearance or phenomenon, a potential sign. \"Secondness\" is reaction or resistance, a category associated with moving from possibility to determinate actuality. Here, through experience outside of and collateral to the given sign or sign system, one recalls or discovers the object the sign refers to, for example when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent but remembered object. It is through one's collateral experience that the object determines the sign to determine an interpretant. \"Thirdness\" is representation or mediation, the category associated with signs, generality, rule, continuity, habit-taking, and purpose. Here one forms an interpretant expressing a meaning or ramification of the sign about the object. When a second sign is considered, the initial interpretant may be confirmed, or new possible meanings may be identified. As each new sign is addressed, more interpretants, themselves signs, emerge. It can involve a mind's reading of nature, people, mathematics, anything.\n\nPeirce generalized the communicational idea of utterance and interpretation of a sign, to cover all signs:\nAccording to Nattiez, writing with Jean Molino, the tripartite definition of sign, object, and interpretant is based on the \"trace\" or neutral level, Saussure's \"sound-image\" (or \"signified\", thus Peirce's \"representamen\"). Thus, \"a symbolic form...is not some 'intermediary' in a process of 'communication' that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex \"process\" of creation (the poietic process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the \"esthesic\" process that \"reconstructs\" a 'message'\").\n\nMolino's and Nattiez's diagram:\n\nPeirce's theory of the sign therefore offered a powerful analysis of the signification system, its codes, and its processes of inference and learning—because the focus was often on natural or cultural context rather than linguistics, which only analyses usage in slow-time whereas human semiotic interaction in the real world often has a chaotic blur of language and signal exchange. Nevertheless, the implication that triadic relations are structured to perpetuate themselves leads to a level of complexity not usually experienced in the routine of message creation and interpretation. Hence, different ways of expressing the idea have developed.\n\nBy 1903 Peirce came to classify signs by three universal trichotomies dependent on his three categories (quality, fact, habit). He classified any sign: \n\nBecause of those classificatory interdependences, the three trichotomies intersect to form ten (rather than 27) classes of signs. There are also various kinds of meaningful combination. Signs can be attached to one another. A photograph is an index with a meaningfully attached icon. Arguments are composed of dicisigns, and dicisigns are composed of rhemes. In order to be embodied, legisigns (types) need sinsigns (tokens) as their individual replicas or instances. A symbol depends as a sign on how it \"will\" be interpreted, regardless of resemblance or factual connection to its object; but the symbol's individual embodiment is an index to your experience of the object. A symbol is instanced by a specialized indexical sinsign. A symbol such as a sentence in a language prescribes qualities of appearance for its instances, and is itself a replica of a symbol such as a proposition apart from expression in a particular language. Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his theoretical grammar, as he sometimes called it. He regarded formal semiotic, as logic, as furthermore encompassing study of arguments (hypothetical, deductive, and inductive) and inquiry's methods including pragmatism; and as allied to but distinct from logic's pure mathematics.\n\nPeirce sometimes referred to the “ground” of a sign. The ground is the pure abstraction of a quality. A sign's ground is the \"respect\" in which the sign represents its object, e.g. as in literal and figurative language. For example, an icon \"presents\" a characteristic or quality attributed to an object, while a symbol \"imputes\" to an object a quality either presented by an icon or symbolized so as to evoke a mental icon.\n\nPeirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a \"hypoicon\", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the \"image\", which depends on a simple quality; (b) the \"diagram\", whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the \"metaphor\", which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else. A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form \"All __ is ___\" which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations. Peirce held that mathematics is done by diagrammatic thinking — observation of, and experimentation on, diagrams. Peirce developed for deductive logic a system of visual existential graphs, which continue to be researched today.\n\nIt is now agreed that the effectiveness of the acts that may convert the message into text (including speaking, writing, drawing, music and physical movements) depends upon \"the knowledge of the sender\". If the sender is not familiar with the current language, its codes and its culture, then he or she will not be able to say anything at all, whether as a visitor in a different language area or because of a medical condition such as aphasia (see Roman Jakobson).\n\nModern theories deny the Saussurian distinction between signifier and signified, and look for meaning not in the individual signs, but in their context and the framework of potential meanings that could be applied. Such theories assert that language is a collective memory or cultural history of all the different ways in which meaning has been communicated, and may to that extent, constitute all life's experiences (see Louis Hjelmslev). Hjelmslev did not consider the sign to be the smallest semiotic unit, as he believed it possible to decompose it further; instead, he considered the \"internal structure of language\" to be a system of \"figurae\", a concept somewhat related to that of figure of speech, which he considered to be the ultimate semiotic unity.\n\nThis position implies that speaking is simply one more form of behaviour and changes the focus of attention from the text as language, to the text as a representation of purpose, a functional version of the author's intention. But, once the message has been transmitted, the text exists independently.\n\nHence, although the writers who co-operated to produce this page exist, they can only be represented by the signs actually selected and presented here. The interpretation process in the receiver's mind may attribute meanings completely different from those intended by the senders. But, why might this happen? Neither the sender nor the receiver of a text has a perfect grasp of all language. Each individual's relatively small \"stock\" of knowledge is the product of personal experience and their attitude to learning. When the audience receives the message, there will always be an excess of connotational meanings available to be applied to the particular signs in their context (no matter how relatively complete or incomplete their knowledge, the cognitive process is the same).\n\nThe first stage in understanding the message is therefore, to suspend or defer judgement until more information becomes available. At some point, the individual receiver decides which of all possible meanings represents the best possible fit. Sometimes, uncertainty may not be resolved, so meaning is indefinitely deferred, or a provisional or approximate meaning is allocated. More often, the receiver's desire for closure (see Gestalt psychology) leads to simple meanings being attributed out of prejudices and without reference to the sender's intentions.\n\nIn critical theory, the notion of sign is used variously. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1545862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1545862", "title": "Soapbox", "text": "Soapbox\n\nA soapbox is a raised platform on which one stands to make an impromptu speech, often about a political subject. The term originates from the days when speakers would elevate themselves by standing on a wooden crate originally used for shipment of soap or other dry goods from a manufacturer to a retail store.\n\nThe term is also used metaphorically to describe a person engaging in often flamboyant impromptu or unofficial public speaking, as in the phrases \"He's on his soapbox\", or \"Get off your soapbox.\" Hyde Park, London is known for its Sunday soapbox orators, who have assembled at Speakers' Corner since 1872 to discuss religion, politics, and other topics. Blogs can be used as soapboxes within the context of the World Wide Web.\n\nThroughout the 19th Century and into the 20th, prior to the invention of corrugated fiberboard, manufacturers used wooden crates for the shipment of wholesale merchandise to retail establishments. Discarded containers of every size, well-constructed and sturdy, were readily available in most towns. These \"soapboxes\" made free and easily portable temporary platforms for street corner speakers attempting to be seen and heard at improvised \"outdoor meetings,\" to which passersby would gather to hear often provocative speeches on religious or political themes.\n\nThe decades immediately preceding World War I have been called the \"Golden Age of Soapbox Oratory.\" Working people had little money to spend and tub-thumping public speakers pushing their social or political agendas provided a form of mass entertainment. Radical political parties, intent on bringing what they perceived as an emancipatory message to the working class, were particularly intent upon making use of \"street meetings,\" with their speeches and leaflets, to advance their specific message.\n\nStreet-corner oratory could also present its share of problems. Chief among these was the policy of local law enforcement authorities, who sometimes saw in radical political discourse a form of incitement to crime and violence and a threat to public order. Additionally, large street corner crowds listening to \"soapboxers\" would often obstruct public walkways or spill into public streets, creating inconveniences to pedestrians or vehicular traffic alike. Consequently, local authorities would often attempt to restrict public oratory through licensing or prescriptive banning.\n\nThis conflict between dedicated political or religious partisans, on the one hand, and civil authorities intent upon the maintenance of public order, on the other, made soapboxing a matter of frequent public contention. Throughout its history, soapboxing has been tied to the right to speak. From the period 1907 to approximately 1916, the Industrial Workers of the World conducted dozens of free speech fights in the United States, particularly in the West and the Northwest, in order to protect or reclaim their right to soapbox. Many prominent socialists and other radicals cut their political teeth in these or similar free speech fights, including Seattle newspaper publisher Hermon Titus, Socialist Party of Washington leaders Alfred Wagenknecht and L.E. Katterfeld, IWW activist Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and prominent syndicalist William Z. Foster.\n\nAdditional problems could be presented to street corner orators from rival political groups or hecklers. A skilled and effective \"soapboxer\" had to be quick on his feet, figuratively and sometimes literally, having the ability to express political opinions with clarity, to have ready answers for common objections, to be able to deflect hostility with humor or satire, and to be able to face difficulty or danger with fortitude. Soapboxing proved to be what one historian has called \"a hard, but nevertheless necessary, process in the development of revolutionary leaders.\"\n\nDuring the 1960s, a Free Speech Movement was initiated on the Berkeley, California Campus over fund-raising at an intersection and other political freedoms, and the fight eventually spread to other college campuses across the United States.\n\nIn the 1992 UK General Election, the Conservative Party were widely expected to be defeated by Neil Kinnock's Labour Party. Tory leader John Major took his campaign into the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned soapbox. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting negative campaign advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation.

His given name has appeared variously as Salomon or Shlomo or Shloyme and his family name has also been rendered as Ettingher.\n\nEttinger was born in Warsaw; after being orphaned at an early age, he was raised in Łęczna by a paternal uncle, Mendel Ettinger, a rabbi who was proficient in German, and open to allowing his nephew to explore aspects of the Enlightenment as part of his education. \n\nAt the age of 15, Solomon Ettinger entered into an arranged marriage with Golda, the daughter of magnate Judah Leib Wolf, of Zamość. The young couple moved to Zamość, and lived with Golda's parents. There Ettinger came under the influence of the Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment movement.\n\nBy 1795, Poland had been partitioned between Prussia, Russia and Austria. Zamość was in the Austrian partition, but the residents spoke primarily Polish and the Zamość had a large Jewish population.\n\nEventually, he traveled to the big town of the Austrian partition, the primarily Polish-Ukrainian city of Lviv (then often known as Lemberg), to study medicine at its renowned University. After years of learning, he graduated with a medical degree and returned to his native region, but was unable to practice as a physician. By 1832 the city of Zamość, where Ettinger now lived, had been incorporated into the Russian partition, the most intolerant of the three. Anti-Jewish pogroms were frequent and Ettinger's degree was declared invalid, because it came from an ostensibly foreign institution.\n\nAfter numerous attempts at other professions, including an unsuccessful period with an agricultural group, Ettinger settled in Odessa, a Russian Black Sea port with a substantial number of Jewish residents, and attempted to make a living as a writer, while supplementing his income with various short-lived jobs. Much of what he has written is now lost, but his sketches, poetry and songs were published in various Yiddish-language periodicals of the time. His only surviving dramas are fragments of two plays \"Der Feter fun America\" (\"The Uncle from America\") and \"Freleche Yungeleut\" (\"Carefree Youth\") found after his death, and the play that keeps his name alive and is still performed by Yiddish theaters around the world, \"Serkele\" which, while written when Ettinger was in his twenties, and performed during his lifetime, was first published posthumously in 1861.\n\n\"Serkele\" is one of the most renowned plays in the entire repertoire of the Yiddish theater and owes its high reputation to its strong sense of form, sound and rhythm. The characters are delineated in a masterful style comparable to that of the most esteemed dramatists and its outlook remains alive and fresh after 180 years. The Yiddish linguistic stylization in \"Serkele\" and the two fragmentary plays is crisp and self-assured, displaying a mastery of the medium. Renowned Yiddish playwrights who flourished immediately after Ettinger, such as Abraham Goldfaden and Jacob Gordin have written how much they were influenced by \"Serkele\".\n\nNo clear details have emerged as to the circumstances of his death. Such writings of his that did survive were preserved by his family and published posthumously, in most cases, decades after their author's death.\n\n"}

{"id": "47376782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47376782", "title": "Verb-initial word order", "text": "Verb-initial word order\n\nIn syntax, verb-initial (V1) word order is a word order in which the verb appears before the subject and the object. In the more narrow sense, this term is used specifically to describe the word order of V1 languages (a V1 language being a language where the word order is obligatorily or predominantly verb-initial). V1 clauses only occur in V1 languages and other languages with a dominant V1 order displaying other properties that correlate with verb-initiality and that are crucial to many analyses of V1. V1 languages are estimated to make up 12-19% of the world’s languages.\n\nV1 languages constitute a diverse group from different language families. They include Berber, Biu-Mandara, Surmic, and Nilo-Saharan languages in Africa; Celtic languages in Europe; Mayan, and Oto-Manguean languages in North and Central America; Salish, Wakashan, and Tsimshiani languages in North America; Arawakan languages in South America; Austronesian languages in Southeast Asia. Some languages are strictly VSO, for example Q’anjob’al (Mayan). Others are strictly VOS, for example Malagasy (Austronesian). Many alternate between VSO and VOS, an example being Ojibwe (Algonquian).\n\nThe following examples illustrate the rigid VOS and VSO languages and the VOS/VSO-alternating languages.:\n\nQ’anjob’al (VSO)\n\nMalagasy (VOS)\n\nOjibwe (VOS/VSO)\n\nVSO order:\n\nVOS order:\n\nVerb-initial languages pattern with SVO languages on many of their word orders. The similarity between the word orders typical for both verb-initial languages and SVO languages has led many typologists to refer to all of these languages as simply VO. According to Matthew Dryer’s 1992 study of a worldwide sample of languages, the majority of VO languages (of which verb-initial languages are a subtype) have the following word order tendencies:\n\nStrong tendencies:\n\n\nWeak tendencies:\n\n\nMany functional linguists do not posit an underlying syntactic tree in which a verb-initial language is SVO. Rather than try to find ways to derive the structures of verb-initial languages from underlyingly SVO structures, functional linguists would look at how cognitive principles make it possible for languages to have different word orders and why certain word orders are more common, less common, or almost non-existent. Russell Tomlin (in his 1986 paper \"Basic word order. Functional principles\") argued that there are three cognitively grounded principles which can account for the observed distributions of the frequencies of word order in human languages. The three principles are:\n\n\nSince subjects are generally more likely than objects to be topics and to have animate referents, the topic-first principle and the animate-first principle both cause a strong tendency in languages to prefer the subject to go before the object. Thus, languages where the object comes before the subject are rare.\n\nOf the three possible word orders in which the subject comes before the object (VSO, SVO, and SOV), the VSO is less common because of the verb-object bonding principle, which states that objects tend to be more closely tied to verbs than subjects are (which is supported by phenomena such as object incorporation being found in many languages). Because of this principle, the two orders in which the object and verb are placed next to each other (SVO and SOV) are more common than VSO.\n\nThe way the three principles interact to produce stark differences in frequencies between the word orders is illustrated by the table below (the assumption is that the more of the three principles a particular word order satisfies the more frequent it would be):\n\nAccording to the table above, the application of these three principles would predict the following hierarchy in the relative frequencies of word order:\n\nSOV=SVO > VSO > VOS=OVS > OSV\n\nThis prediction roughly corresponds to the real frequencies observed in the world's languages:\n\n\nThere are a number of different solutions proposed for deriving V1 word order in the generative framework. These solutions include the movement of the verb or verbal phrase from traditional SVO sentences, lowering the subject from a higher position, such as Spec-IP to adjoin to a projection of the verb, or stipulating that the specifier is right branching instead of the more common left branching specifiers found in X-bar theory.\n\nA common analysis for V1 word order is the head-raising of the verb from a base-generated SVO sentence into a position higher than the subject. This is a popular proposal for Irish and other Celtic languages, but also has been applied to Afroasiatic V1 languages such as Berber and Arabic (Ouhalla 1994). The V0 raising account has also been proposed for a number of Austronesian languages, but there is no existing proposal for Mayan languages.\n\nTo derive VSO word order, the verb raises through head movement and raises to either C or T.\n\nDeriving VOS order through V head-raising is less straightforward. The common solution is scrambling, which has been proposed for deriving Tongan (Otsuka 2002) and Tagalog (Rackowski 2002) sentences. The scrambling mechanism involves the object moving to a high position, such as Spec,TP (Otsuka 2002), in order to check information structure features.\n\nThe head-movement analysis is motivated by ellipsis data in Celtic and Semitic languages, and by verb-adjacent particles and adverbs in Austronesian languages.\n\nIn Irish, elliding all postverbal arguments is possible, suggesting that the subject and the verb belong to one functional projection, and the verb is outside of it (McCloskey 1991).\n\nIn Tagalog, there can be adverbs between the verb and the object in VOS order, implying that the verb and the object can be separated, and do not form a constituent. In Tongan, there is an asymmetry between case-marked arguments and clitic pronouns: the clitics surface pre-verbally, whereas the case-marked nouns can only surface post-verbally (Otsuka 2005). Otsuka (2005) proposed that the subject clitic undergoes head-movement to T0, and attaches to the verb, whereas the case-marked subject moves to Spec,TP. He concludes that only verb head-movement can explain such a syntactic asymmetry in Tongan.\n\nV1 word order can also be analyzed as a derivation from the more common SVO order through verbal phrase movement. This solution is commonly proposed for Austronesian languages. Accounts on phrasal movement differ on 1) the highest maximal projection that moves (VP, vP, or TP), 2) the landing site of the moved phrase (Spec,TP or higher), and 3) the motivation for movement (generally agreed to be the EPP).\n\nVOS order can be derived straightforwardly by raising the VP to a specifier position in a higher projection, such as the TP. \nVSO order, on the other hand, has to be derived by remnant movement of the VP after evacuating the object from the phrase first.\nAn argument for VP raising is the island constraints that arise in the VP in VOS sentences, due to The Freezing Principle, which says that there can be no movement out of a moved constituent.\n\nVarious Austronesian languages follow this constraint to various levels. Seediq for example is strict in that only VP-external constituents can go under A’-movement. Toba Batak, Tagalog, and Malagasy on the other hand, have this restriction only for VP-internal arguments, while allowing adverbs and indirect objects to surface clause-initially. One proposal to solve this problem is to propose that adjuncts evacuate from the VP, before it raises.\n\nMayan languages, on the other hand, do not have such a restriction. Ch'ol, for example, allows object extraction in WH-questions from VOS word orders. For such cases, it has been proposed that the object evacuates before the phrasal movement to a higher position than the subject, and thus can undergo WH-movement later.\n\nSome researchers have proposed deriving verb-initial word order by modifying the basic X-bar structure to permit right ward specifiers. This analysis has been particularly influential for Mayan languages, notably by Judith Aissen for Tzotzil. This is notable because it goes against standard X-bar theory and modern Minimalist theories where all specifiers are required to be leftward.\n\nThe difference between VSO and VOS word orders in a right-hand specifier theory is accomplished via a combination of controlling which specifiers are right-ward and controlling which argument(s) moves. VOS word can be derived from the base positions of a VP with a right-specifier (note that the majority of this literature assumes the VP-Internal hypothesis). From the base position, VOS can also be derived by moving the subject up to any right-specifier position (e.g. the specifier of IP).\n\nVSO word order is derived from the same base order. The object then moves to a right-specifier position above the VP (the specific landing site will vary from language to language).\n\nMovement of either the subject or object arguments was originally motivated by positing an EPP feature on the landing site. Modern analyses are more likely to argue that movement is motivated by a need to give the argument case or for purposes of information structure.\n\nAnother type of approach to derive verb-initial word orders involves subject lowering, resulting in a structure in which the subject follows the verb. Whereas proposals for V-raising and VP-raising generally assume that the linear order of a sentence is derived in syntax, the subject lowering account assumes that phonological well-formedness determines the linear word order. Subject lowering has been proposed by Sabbagh (2013). He treats subject lowering as a prosodic phenomenon.\n\nThe basic idea is as follows. After the syntactic derivation is done, the subject is in SpecIP/SpecTP. On its way to phonological realization, the end result of the syntactic derivation can be manipulated in order to satisfy phonological and morphological requirements. In the case of subject lowering, the subject will move to V and right-adjoin to it, as illustrated by the tree below (taken from Clemens & Polinsky).\n\nDifferent languages are said to feature subject lowering, namely Berber (Choe 1987), Chamorro (Chung 1990, 1998), Tagalog (Sabbagh 2005, 2013).\n\nAs Clemens & Polinsky (2015) explain, support for subject lowering comes from coordination facts. When two sentences are coordinated, the subject must be able to have scope over the coordination, even though it shows up in a lower position in the clause. To be able to have this scope, the subject needs to occupy a high position in the syntactic derivation.\n\nSabbagh (2013) proposes a prosodic constraint to motivate subject lowering in Tagalog. This constraint is called Weak Start and it says that \"[a] prosodic constituent begins with a leftmost daughter, which is no higher on the prosodic hierarchy than the constituent that immediately follows.\" This proposal is situated in Match Theory (Selkirk 2011). Match Theory states that clauses (CP and IP/TP) with illocutionary force correspond to intonational phrases (ɩ), XPs correspond to phonological phrases (φ), and X⁰s correspond to phonological words (ω). Sabbagh (2013) proposes that the prosodic hierarchy is as follows:\n\nProsodic hierarchy: ɩ > φ > ω.\n\nThe prosodic constraint Weak Start regulates the order in which different members of the hierarchy can appear in a single prosodic phrase. The hierarchy states that elements that are relatively high on the prosodic hierarchy need to be preceded by elements that are equal or lower to them on the prosodic hierarchy (Sabbagh 2013). In other words, phonological phrases (φ) need to be preceded by phonological words (ω).\n\nThis structure does not meet the requirement that Weak Start imposes on it (\"i.e.\" elements high on the prosodic hierarchy need to be preceded by elements that are equal or lower on the hierarchy). The subject, which is a phonological phrase (φ), precedes the verb, a phonological word (ω). This means that there is a mismatch between syntax and phonology. In other words, for syntactic reasons, the subject must be high (because of scope over coordinations), but for phonology, the subject needs to follow the verb, instead of preceding it. Lowering the subject resolves this mismatch. The structure after subject lowering is illustrated in the structures below.\n\nIn these structures the verb (ω) precedes the hierarchically higher subject (φ). This structure obeys Weak Start. Thus, subject lowering is applied in order to satisfy this prosodic structure constraint.\n\nSyntactic structures involving subject lowering obey syntactic and phonological principles. The subject has moved to SpecIP/SpecTP, which gives it its necessary scope (as can be inferred from coordination structures). Lowering the subject in the prosodic structure causes the structure to obey the phonological constraint Weak Start as well.\n"}

He traveled widely across Spain to visit crypto-Muslim communities and wrote several works about Islam which includes accounts from his travels. His real identity and dates of birth and death are unknown, but most of his travels took place in the first half of the sixteenth century.\n\nThe Young Man was born in Arévalo to a mother who was converted to Christianity. His birth date is unknown, but his youth was estimated to be in the period following the end of Reconquista, marked by the Fall of Granada in 1492 and the forced conversion of Muslims in Castile, 15001502. When he was young, he traveled to virtually all parts of Spain except the seabord provinces, which was forbidden to him due to his status as Morisco. Places he visited include Alcántara, Almagro, Astorga, Ávila, Gandia, Granada, Jaén, Ocaña, Requena, Ronda, Segovia, and Zaragoza. He collaborated with Bray de Reminjo, the faqih of the village of Cadrete in Aragon, to write an Islamic religious manual called \"Brief compendium of our sacred law and sunna\", in the 1530s. At this point he was presumed to have been a reputable writer. Bray de Reminjo described him as \"intellectual\", a Castilian from Arévalo, and described that in addition to speaking Spanish and being well-versed in \"aljamiado\", he also read Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. His works show his familiarity with the Quran, the writings of Thomas à Kempis, especially \"The Imitation of Christ\", as well as the medieval novel \"La Celestina\". His familiarity with Christian works was likely the result of his being obligated to attend missionary sermons.\n\nAccounts of his travels included participating in a secret congregational ritual prayer (\"salat jama'ah\") in Zaragoza, meeting with Muslim notables and preachers, including some women, and collecting alms to go for pilgrimage to Mecca. It is unclear whether he was ultimately successful in visiting Mecca, given that travel out of the country was illegal for Moriscos. Throughout his writings he showed deep conviction that Islam was the right faith and that it would triumph again in Spain within his lifetime.\n\nHe wrote at least three extant works, the \"Brief compendium of our sacred law and sunna\" (c. 1533), the \"Tafsira\" (c. 1533), and the \"Summary of the Account and Spiritual Exercise\" (c. shortly before 1550), all written in Spanish with Arabic script (\"aljamiado\"), and primarily about religious topics. In addition to the religious content, the works included accounts of his travels, his meetings with other clandestine Muslims, and descriptions of their religious practices and discussions. These accounts and reminiscences provide historians with information about the crypto-Muslim community in fifteenth-century Spain and their practices.\n\nThe \"Brief Compendium\" is a work of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), covering topics of \"ibadah\" (Islamic acts of worship) and Islamic economics. It was written in collaboration with Bray de Reminjo, marking a rare collaboration between Castilian (represented by the Young Man) and Aragonese (by Bray) Muslim traditions. The \"Tafsira\" is a \"tafsir\" or a commentary of the Quran. The \"Summary\" is a religious book on topics of devotion and piety.\n\nSpanish scholar Pascual de Gayangos y Arce mentioned in 1839 of having seen an additional work he called \"The Pilgrimage of the Young Man\" in Madrid, but this work is now lost.\n\nIn 1980, Spanish author Gregorio Fonseca Antuña discovered close similarities between passages in the \"Summary\" and passages from Thomas à Kempis's 15th-century work \"The Imitation of Christ\", a Christian devotional book. The passages were often adapted to replace specific Christian contexts and features with Islamic ones, while keeping the spiritual and moral meaning intact. These similarities occur frequently throughout the book, including in long passages. According to historian L. P. Harvey, Kempis' influence is \"established beyond doubt\", and could not have been due to chance. The Young Man did not cite Kempis as sources for the passages, and frequently attributed the passages to Islamic scholars such as al-Ghazali and Ibn Arabi, misleadingly. The adaptation of Christian devotional literature in his Islamic work could be the result of his being obligated to attend missionary sermons, and a lack of access to actual Islamic literature. In contrast to the \"Summary\", the Young Man's other works show considerable originality.\n\nHistorian L. P. Harvey proposed that the Young Man of Arévalo might have been the same person as Agustín de Ribera, a Morisco from Arévalo who claimed to be a prophet and had the epithet of \"el mozo\" (the lad), although he admitted that the theory had a lot of difficulties that he had not resolved. Agustín was arrested by the Spanish Inquisition in 1540 and records from his interrogation survived.\n\nThe Young Man's works became known throughout the Morisco community, and he achieved fame as a scholar. His works were copied up to the end of the sixteenth century, and cited by Morisco authors up to the beginning of the seventeenth century, just before the expulsion of the Moriscos.\n\nHe was the most productive known Islamic author in Spain during the period after the forced conversion of Muslims there, today historians often single him out for attention in studies of Morisco literature in this period. \n\n\n"}
