{"id": "49660877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49660877", "title": "Al-Hujayjah", "text": "Al-Hujayjah\n\nAl-Ḥujayjah, also known as Safīyah bint Thaʻlabah al-Shaybānīyah (Arabic: صفية بنت ثعلبة الشيبانية) was a pre-Islamic poet of the Banū Shaybān tribe, noted for her work in the genre of taḥrīḍ (incitement to vengeance). Her dates of birth and death are unknown, and even her historicity is open to question. But she seems to have granted protection to al-Ḥurqah bint al-Nuʻmān when Khosrow II (r. 590-628) demanded her in marriage from her father al-Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir around the beginning of the seventh century, and her surviving corpus relates to the Battle of Dhū-Qār in c. 609. Characterised as a 'warrior diplomat', she has been read as a key figure in pre-Islamic poetry.\n\nAs with other supposedly pre-Islamic poetry, there has been scholarly debate over whether Al-Ḥujayjah's work might actually have been fabricated later in the medieval period (even if she herself was real). It survives only in Bishr ibn Marwān al-Asadī's collection \"Ḥarb Banī Shaybān maʻa Kisrá Ānūshirwān\" (), which identifies Al-Ḥujayjah's father as Thaʻlabah al-Shaybānī. It is plausible that the poetry was composed in the Abbasid period to encourage ethnic Arabs to resist the claims for parity of status within the Caliphate by Persian members, known as the Shu'ubiyya movement.\n\nAccording to Hamad Alajmi, 'Al-Ḥujayjah’s poetry, in general, is similar to other female poets from the pre-Islamic period. Her poems are short and consist of one section as opposed to the standard tripartite pre-Islamic odes ... Her language is pragmatic and lacks metaphorical diction, but is rich in imperative verbs and direct language.'\n\nAn example of her poetry, as translated by Alajmi, is this incitement to her people to receive and protect al-Ḥurqah bint al-Nuʻmān:\n1. Oh Banū Shaybān, give life to [the tradition] of protecting the neighbor for all<br>\nThe Arabs have let it die.<br>\n2. What is your excuse? When a noble freewoman [al-Ḥurqah] has wrapped herself<br>\nIn my clothes, [she is] planted in pearls and coral.<br>\n3. [She is] the daughter of the kings, the owners of kingdoms and high ranks,<br>\nShe wears anklets and is the best of Nuʻmān’s [family].<br>\n4. Will you urge each other, sharpen your swords,<br>\nStraighten your spears,<br>\n5. And prepare your soldiers? O my people,<br>\nWill you prepare your battle-gear?<br>\n6. For I have granted protection to a noble woman from the people of Kisrá ,<br>\n[To be protected] by the elders and the youths of our people.<br>\n7. Shaybān are my people. Is there another tribe like them?<br>\nIn combat and the charging of knights?<br>\n8. No, by the best of the clans of Rabīʻah.<br>\nNo one is like them when disasters strike.<br>\n9. My people grant protection to the refugee, from his enemy<br>\nAnd they protect my life from life’s misfortunes.<br>\n10. The sons of my father arrive at the battlefield not fearing<br>\nThe attacks of the enemy and the assaults of the opponents.<br>\n11. Indeed, I am Ḥujayjah [of the tribe] of Wāʼil, and with Wāʼil,<br>\nA man pursued escapes on a mare or a stallion.<br>\n12. O people of Shaybān, you have been victorious in the world,<br>\nBecause of your honor, favor and beneficence.\n\n"}

He was associated with Kathantar, Vikalp, Aagamikal, Sampa, Manorama, Ganga, Sunday Observer (Hindi), Bharti Features, Uxhur Bharat, Bharatiya Jnanpith, Remadhav Publications. His stories have been aired on All India Radio and short films have been made on his stories.\n\nHe was born in Multan (undivided India) in one of the affluent Brahmin families. At the age of 2, his family moved from Multan (now in Pakistan) to Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh. He graduated with an MA (Hindi), Shahitya Shiromani (Gold Medallist) and Shahitya Ratna from Allahabad University.\n\nHe used to live in his ancestral house in Mirzapur, and he found a Pandora's Box of Hindi literature in the collection of \"Saraswati\" editions. As a child he was influenced by the literally articles published in the \"Saraswati\" magazine, and started writing in the very early age. He was one of the regular members of the school debate team and won several debate and writing competitions. In his adolescent, he started writing poems and started reciting poems in literally group and meeting conducted by Rotary Club, Mirzapur. He has also written a book on history of Mirzapur.\n\nHe moved to Allahabad to study. commerce, at Allahabad University. Allahabad was considered at that time the literary capital of India. He became associated with stalwarts of Hindi literature like Sumitranandan Pant, Shailesh Matiyani, Naresh Mehta, Mahadevi Verma, Ilaychand Joshi and many more. He became one of the regular features of literally meetings (Sahitic Ghosthi). During that time he wrote many stories, which were broadcast on All India Radio and published in Hindi dailies like Aaj, Dainik Bhaskar, and various other magazines. He also published a literally magazine \"Kathantar\" and associated with Vikalp (a magazine of Late Shri. Shailesh Matiyani), Aagamikaal (a magazine of Late Shri Naresh Mehta) and Manorama (Mitra Prakashan) and Sampa (Children Magazine)\n\nVaichariki days\n\nAmar Goswami formed a group to organise literary meetings named \"Vaichariki\" in Allahabad. The literally meeting (sahitic ghosti) was an open forum where all the participants used to discuss and share their views about the most recent works of the Hindi writers of the time. It used to happen once in a month where the guest speaker used to preside in the meeting and start the discussion about the recent works of participants. The meetings featured most of the prominent Hindi writers like Sumitranandan Pant, Illaichand Joshi, Naresh Mehta, Shailesh Matiyani and many more\n\nAfter coming to Delhi, he changed his style of writing, which included the life, problems and the struggle of common man and middle class society in the metropolitan city. He used his wit to highlight the struggle of the common man and he wrote some of the masterpieces like Kalakar, Harap Ram Gadap, Buzo Bahadur, Juta, Apna Utsav, Govind Gatha etc.\n\nHis first collection of short stories \"Himayati\" was published in 1986, since then more than 25 books, which includes collection of short stories, novel, children books and books especially written for National Book Trust campaign on Adult Education were published. Also, he translated more than 70 books from Bengali to Hindi. He was also a part of expert panel of NCERT workshops conducted on syllabus design and selection of stories for Hindi subject.\n\nHe is the master of writing satire and brings light to some of the common events happening around us. And his writing focuses only towards the common man's problems like super fast life of metropolitans, human relation, corruption, social discrimination, poverty and government policies and he also focused on different aspect of nature of the human being (preachers don't follow what they preach). He was able to connect people with his writing.\n\nThis is the only published of the two novels that have been written by him. This novel casts multiple characters and has beautifully developed all the characters. The most important and powerful character of this novel is Ananya who epitomises the empowerment of women in the shining India.\n\nHe has devoted equal time in translating masterpieces of Bengali writers from Bengali to Hindi. He always wanted to make people aware of the great books written in Bengali language. He used to say that \"readers should not be deprived of reading the great works due to the language constraints; and he is contributing his share by translating some works of the Bengali writers in Hindi.\"\n\nHe has translated more than 70 books of the prominent writers including Rabindranath Tagore, Taslima Nasrin, Tarashankar Bandhopadyay, Ramanath Ray, Bibhutibhusan Bandopadyay, Nazrul Islam, Satyajit Ray and many more\n\nHimayati\n\nMahuye Ka Ped\n\nDhartiputra, \n\nUdhas Raghodas\n\nAranya Mein Hum\n\nBuzo Bahadur\n\nBhool Bulayya\n\nApni Apni Duniya\n\nKal Ka Bharosa\n\nMahabali\n\nIkkis Kahaniya\n\nIs Daur Mein Humsafar\n\nSudama Ki Mukti (Book written for Adult Education Campaign by National Book Trust)\n\nAmar Goswami ki Chuninda Bal kahaniya ( Published by National Book trust- year 2016 )\n\nTunni Machli\n\nTinku Ki Chattri\n\nJiddi Patang\n\nSher Singh Ka Chasma\n\nSabash Munnu\n\nCloud Ice-Cream\n\nDrip-Drop-Drip\n\n"}

In Nigeria, they are found spread between western Kwara State and the Borgu section of Niger State. There are perhaps a million Bariba, 70% of them in Benin, where they are the fourth largest ethnic group and comprise approximately 1/11 of the population (9.2%). The Bariba are concentrated primarily in the north-east of the country, especially around the city of Nikki, which is considered the Bariba capital. They originally migrated from the area of Kwara State, Nigeria, and were renowned horsemen. One of their noted festivals is the annual Gani festival of which horseriding is a prominent element of.\n\nThe Bariba people holds an important place in the history of the country. During the late 19th century, Baribawas known to constitute independent statesand dominate with kingdomsin cities like Nikki and Kandi in the northeast of the country. In the town of Pehunko there are approximately 200,000 Bariba people out of 365,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe Bariba society consists of a higher-ranking official as chief of the town and their subordinates’ chiefs. Social status and titles are inherited in families, but the status of a person may be given by the families’ nature of work. Notable subdivisions of the Bariba include the ruling Wasangari nobles, Baatombu commoners, slaves of varying origin, Dendi merchants, Fulbe herders, and other divisional ethnic groups.\n\nAgriculture is the dominant occupation for the Bariba. They grow corn, sorghum, rice, cotton, cassava (tapioca), yams, beans, palm oil, peanuts and some poultry and livestock. Religion plays an important role in Bariba tribes and they are primarily Islamic. The religion was introduced to Bariba people by Dendi traders who were preaching in the north. However a number of Bariba communities have their own indigenous beliefs.\n\nThe Bariba language is spoken mostly in Borgou, Alibori and part of Atacora in northern Benin. The Bariba language was once classified as an outlier of the Gur family, but is now agnostically placed as an isolate within the Savanna languages.\nIt is a tone language with noun classes. It has been written since about 1970. Transcription using the Beninese national alphabet requires, in addition to the Latin letters, the following characters from the IPA:\n\n"}

It became extinct after World War II, due to extermination of most of its speakers in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nBefore their extermination in the 1940s, speakers of Bohemian Romani, the Bohemian Romanies, were one of several nomadic populations of Bohemia. They led a peripatetic (or semi-peripatetic) way of life, travelling around the country (especially during the warmer seasons of the year) and offering their services to the sedentary population of the Bohemian countryside. They were mostly horse-dealers, peddlars, tinners, and entertainers.\n\nThe first ancestors of Bohemian Romanies probably arrived in Bohemia in the 16th and 17th centuries, from Slovakia via Moravia. Small-scale migration of Romanies from Slovakia to the Czech Lands (as well as backwards) continued throughout the following centuries. The Bohemian Romanies have always been a numerically insignificant minority. In 1939, there were ca. 6,000 people of different Romani groups in the territory of today's Czech Republic (Nečas 1995). Of these, a smaller fraction, perhaps some 2,000 people, lived in Bohemia. The proportion of different Romani groups in this figure is unknown, though the estimate of 500-1,500 of Bohemian Romanies cannot be wildly off the mark.\n\nOther Romani groups in Bohemia, who spoke different dialects of Romani than the Bohemian Romani, included the Sinti and a few families of the Kalderar (or Kalderaš) Roma. The Sinti appear to have been the first Romani group to be established in the region, some of them arriving from southeastern Europe as early as in the 15th century; they mostly inhabited the German-speaking parts of Bohemia. The Kalderar, on the other hand, were relatively late newcomers, having had migrated from Wallachia in the second half of the 19th century. In addition, there were also several non-Romani peripatetic groups in Bohemia, who spoke Czech or German or argots based on these languages.\n\nThe self-ethnonym of Bohemian Romanies was simply \"Rom\" (plural \"Roma\"). They were called \"Hungarians\" by the Sinti; this probably reflects their origin in Slovakia, which was then part of Hungary. They were called \"Poles\" (\"Poljako\", plural \"Poljača\") by the Kalderash, which is one of the ethnonyms the Kalderar use to refer to different Romani groups. The sedentary population referred to all peripatetic groups, including Bohemian Roma, as \"gypsies\": \"cikáni\" in Czech or \"Zigeuner\" in German.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Bohemian Romani was, at least in some groups of Bohemian Roma, gradually becoming a non-native ethnic language, acquired in late childhood and used mostly for secretive purposes (cf. Lesný 1916: 214–216, Lípa 1960: 50). Clearly, a development had started toward a Para-Romani variety, that is, a specialized non-native variety spoken by Roma, which has the grammar of a majority language (Czech in this case) as well as an access to Romani-derived lexicon (Elšík 2003: 44).\n\nThe Nazi genocide of Roma and Sinti in the 1940s brought about radical death of all Romani dialects of pre-war Bohemia, including Bohemian Romani. Only ca. 600 (i.e. 10% of) Czech Roma and Sinti survived the genocide (Nečas 1995), including perhaps a hundred of Bohemian Roma. Bohemian Romani ceased to be used by the survivors due to a complete social disintegration of their communities, and they ceased to transmit the language to their children. The last known speaker of Bohemian Romani died in the 1970s (Hana Šebková, p.c.).\n\nThe historical group of Bohemian Romanies must be distinguished from those Romanies groups that live in Bohemia presently. The latter are post-World War II immigrants from Slovakia (especially Romungro), who do not speak Bohemian Romani.\n\nBohemian Romani belongs to the North Central dialect group of Romani. It is most closely related to Moravian Romani and West Slovak Romani, together with which it forms the Western subgroup of North Central Romani. Although clearly a North Central dialect, Bohemian Romani also shares a few features with the Sinti dialects of Romani. In some cases, these are due to diffusion from Sinti into Bohemian Romani. While Bohemian Romani would have been intelligible to speakers of other North Central dialects, there is evidence that there was no inherent intelligibility between Bohemian Romani and Sinti.\n\nBohemian Romani shares with other dialects of Romani much of its Indo-Aryan vocabulary as well as numerous early loanwords from Western Iranian languages (Persian and/or Kurdish), Armenian, Ossetic, and Greek. In addition, it shares with the other North Central dialects of Romani the layer of loanwords from South Slavic languages, Hungarian, and Slovak. Finally, the most recent loanwords originate in Czech.\n\nExamples of loanwords\n\"Ehas jekh čorro rom. Kerelas buťi. Kana kerelas, kerďas dešupandž karfa, the diňas len peskra romňake, kaj te džal jarreske. Kana vaš oda jarro geľas, avľas, thoďas, ušanďas xumer. Pale kerďas mačiki, thoďas len pro čáro.

{"id": "983002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=983002", "title": "Broadcast automation", "text": "Broadcast automation\n\nBroadcast automation incorporates the use of broadcast programming technology to automate broadcasting operations. Used either at a broadcast network, radio station or a television station, it can run a facility in the absence of a human operator. They can also run in a \"live assist\" mode when there are on-air personnel present at the master control, television studio or control room.\n\nThe radio transmitter end of the airchain is handled by a separate automatic transmission system (ATS).\n\nOriginally, in the USA, many (if not most) broadcast licensing authorities required a licensed board operator to run every station at all times, meaning that every DJ had to pass an exam to obtain a license to be on-air, if their duties also required them to ensure proper operation of the transmitter. This was often the case on overnight and weekend shifts when there was no broadcast engineer present, and all of the time for small stations with only a contract engineer on call.\n\nIn the U.S., it was also necessary to have an operator on duty at all times in case the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) was used, as this had to be triggered manually. While there has not been a requirement to relay any other warnings, any mandatory messages from the U.S. president would have had to first be authenticated with a code word sealed in a pink envelope sent annually to stations by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\nGradually, the quality and reliability of electronic equipment improved, regulations were relaxed, and no operator had to be present (or even available) while a station was operating. In the U.S., this came about when the EAS replaced the EBS, starting the movement toward automation to assist, and sometimes take the place of, the live disc jockeys (DJs) and radio personalities.\n\nEarly automation systems were electromechanical systems which used relays. Later systems were \"computerized\" only to the point of maintaining a schedule, and were limited to radio rather than TV. Music would be stored on reel-to-reel audio tape. Subaudible tones on the tape marked the end of each song. The computer would simply rotate among the tape players until the computer's internal clock matched that of a scheduled event. When a scheduled event would be encountered, the computer would finish the currently-playing song and then execute the scheduled block of events. These events were usually advertisements, but could also include the station's top-of-hour station identification, news, or a bumper promoting the station or its other shows. At the end of the block, the rotation among tapes resumed.\n\nAdvertisements, jingles, and the top-of-hour station identification required by law were often on \"carts\". Short for cartridges, these were endless tapes similar to 4-track tapes, were mechanically identical as well, and were called Fidelipacs. The primary difference between carts and 4 track is two fold. The Cart had only two tracks and the 4-track (obviously) had four. The Cart ran at 7 and 1/2 IPS whereas the 4-Track ran at 3 and 3/4 IPS. Carts had a slot for a pinch roller on a spindle which was activated by solenoid upon pressing the start button on the cart machine. The capstan was spinning at full speed and this allowed for nearly instantaneous playback start without artifacts. Mechanical carousels would rotate the carts in and out of multiple tape players as dictated by the computer. Time announcements were provided by a pair of dedicated cart players, with the even minutes stored on one and the odd minutes on the other. This meant an announcement would always be ready to play, even if the minute was changing when the announcement was triggered. The system did require attention throughout the day to change reels as they ran out and reload carts. It became obsolete when a method was developed to automatically rewind and re-cue the reel tapes when they ran out, extending 'walk-away' time indefinitely.\n\nRadio station WIRX may have been one of the world's first completely automated radio stations, built and designed by Brian Jeffrey Brown in 1963 when Brown was only 10 years old. The station broadcast in a classical format, called \"More Good Music (MGM)\" and featured five-minute bottom-of-the-hour news feeds from the Mutual Broadcasting System. The heart of the automation was an 8 x 24 telephone stepping relay which controlled two reel-to-reel tape decks, one twelve inch Ampex machine providing the main program audio and a second RCA seven inch machine providing \"fill\" music. The tapes played by these machines were originally produced in the Midwest Family Broadcasting (MWF) Madison, Wisconsin production facility by WSJM Chief Engineer Richard E. McLemore (and later in-house at WSJM) with sub-audible tones used to signal the end of a song. The stepping relay was programmed by slide switches in the front of the two relay racks which housed the equipment. The news feeds were triggered by a microswitch which was attached to a Western Union clock and tripped by the minute hand of the clock. and then reset the stepping relay. Originally, 30-minute station identification was accomplished by a simulcast switch in the control booth for sister station WSJM (AM), whereupon the disc jockey in the booth would announce \"This is WSJM-AM and... (then pressing the momentary contact button) ...WSJM-FM, St. Joseph, Michigan.\" This only lasted about six months, however, and a standard tape cartridge player was wired in to announce the station identification and triggered by the Western Union clock.\nA different technology appeared in 1980 with the analog recorders made by Solidyne, which used a computer-controlled tape positioning system. Four GMS 204 units were controlled from a 6809 microprocessor, with the program stored in a solid-state plug-in memory module. This system has a limited programming time of about eight hours.\n\nSatellite programming often used audible dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals to trigger events at affiliate stations. This allowed the automatic local insertion of ads and station IDs. Because there are 12 (or 16) tone pairs, and typically four tones were sent in rapid succession (less than one second), more events could be triggered than by sub-audible tones (usually 25 Hz and 35 Hz).\n\nModern systems run on hard disk, where all of the music, jingles, advertisements, voice tracks, and other announcements are stored. These audio files may be either compressed or uncompressed, or often with only minimal compression as a compromise between file size and quality. For radio software, these disks are usually in computers, sometimes running their own custom operating systems, but more often running as an application on a PC operating system.\nScheduling was an important advance of these systems, allowing for exact timing. Some systems use GPS satellite receivers to obtain exact atomic time, for perfect synchronization with satellite-delivered programming. Reasonably-accurate timekeeping can also be obtained with the use of Internet protocols (IP) like Network Time Protocol (NTP).\n\nAutomation systems are also more interactive than ever before with digital audio workstation (DAW) with console automation and can even record from a telephone hybrid to play back an edited conversation with a telephone caller. This is part of a system's live-assist mode.\n\nThe use of automation software and voice tracks to replace live DJs is a current trend in radio broadcasting, done by many Internet radio and adult hits stations. Stations can even be voice-tracked from another city far away, now often delivering sound files over the Internet. In the U.S., this is a common practice under controversy for making radio more generic and artificial. Having local content is also touted as a way for traditional stations to compete with satellite radio, where there may be no radio personality on the air at all.\nA commercially available, for-sale product named Audicom was introduced by Oscar Bonello in 1989. It is based on psychoacoustic lossy compression, the same principle being used in most modern lossy audio encoders such as MP3 and Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), and it allowed both broadcast automation and recording to hard drives.\n\nIn television, playout automation is also becoming more practical as the storage space of hard drives increases. Television shows and television commercials, as well as digital on-screen graphics (DOG or BUG), can all be stored on video servers remotely controlled by computers utilizing the 9-Pin Protocol and the Video Disk Control Protocol (VDCP). These systems can be very extensive, tied-in with parts that allow the \"ingest\" (as it is called in the industry) of video from satellite networks and electronic news gathering (ENG) operations and management of the video library, including archival of footage for later use. In ATSC, Programming Metadata Communication Protocol (PMCP) is then used to pass information about the video through the airchain to Program and System Information Protocol (PSIP), which transmits the current electronic program guide (EPG) information over digital television to the viewer.\n\n"}

It is a controversial word due to its etymology as a back-formation from the old and well-established word \"inchoate\" that dates from 1534, meaning \"in process of formation\". Because the prefix \"in-\", meaning \"not\", frequently is used to create antonyms, superficially the relationship of the two words seems to make sense, however, the Latin origin of \"inchoate\", the verb \"\", begins with a different use of the prefix \"in-\", wherein the prefix denotes \"within\". Hence, \"inchoate\" was not derived from \"choate\", but the reverse has occurred with apparent misunderstanding of the Latin source, leading to its being challenged as an incongruent word.\n\nThe word became the subject of many discussions after United States Supreme Court associate justice Antonin Scalia admonished an attorney for using the word during oral argument at the high court as if it were an antonym of \"inchoate\", relating that the word did not exist. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary does not list the controversial word other than as a biographical reference to a surname (Rufus Choate 1799–1859, an American jurist) and to an educational institution bearing that proper name from its founders.\n\nAmerican linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer argues that, although faulty, its use among lawyers has been documented since at least 1828, and it was used by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., among other legal luminaries of the 20th century. It is included in most legal dictionaries and lexicons; however, \"Black's Law Dictionary\" editor-in-chief Bryan Garner essentially agrees with Scalia. Nonetheless, Garner admits its common acceptance and use within the legal profession. In \"IRS v. McDermott\", 507 U.S. 447 (1993), Scalia quoted a 1954 precedent, \"but substituted \"[no longer inchoate]\" for choate\".\n\n\"No longer inchoate\" is a phrase used in other contexts as well to convey a more exact meaning. Antonyms listed by the \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary\" for \"inchoate\" are \"adult\", \"full-blown\", \"full-fledged\", \"mature\", \"ripe\", and \"ripened\".\n\n\"Choate\" has been used in several legal contexts, for example, any \"choate right is an undefeatable right that is totally valid and ... totally free from encumbrances\", and a \"choate lien is ... certain and definite\". Such a lien is a perfected security interest as used in the U.S. Federal Bankruptcy Code and Uniform Commercial Code. In the context of reference to liens, rights in equity, and inchoate crimes, it has been used as the antonym of inchoate.\n"}

However, as the amount of currency in circulation increased, they found that they needed a more efficient way to count currency.

{"id": "8001341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8001341", "title": "Democratic deficit in the European Union", "text": "Democratic deficit in the European Union\n\nThe notion of a democratic deficit within the European Union (EU) is the idea that the governance of the EU lacks democratic legitimacy. This led in part to an elected European Parliament being created in 1979 and given the power to approve or reject EU legislation. Since then, usage of the term has broadened to describe newer issues facing the European Union. However voter turnout has fallen consecutively at the seven elections since the first election in 1979 and voter turnout in the 2014 election stood at 42.54% of all European voters. This is the lowest of any national election in the 28 countries of the European Union where turnout at national elections averages 68% across the EU.\n\nOpinions differ as to whether the EU has a democratic deficit or how it should be remedied if it exists. Pro-Europeans (i.e. those in favour of the EU) argue that the European Union should reform its institutions to make them more accountable, while Eurosceptics argue that the EU should reduce its powers and often campaign for withdrawal from the EU.\n\nThe phrase \"democratic deficit\" is cited as having first been used in 1977 by the Young European Federalists in their Manifesto, which was drafted by Richard Corbett. In 1979 it was used by David Marquand in reference to the then European Economic Community, the forerunner of the European Union. He argued that the European Parliament (then the Assembly) suffered from a democratic deficit as it was not directly elected by the citizens of the Community. 'Democratic deficit', in relation to the European Union, refers to a perceived lack of accessibility to the ordinary citizen, or lack of representation of the ordinary citizen, and lack of accountability of European Union institutions.\n\nIn the European Union, there are two sources of democratic legitimacy: the European Parliament, chosen by the electorates of the individual EU countries; and the Council of the European Union (the \"Council of Ministers\"), together with the European Council (of heads of national governments), that represent the peoples of the individual states. The European Commission (the executive branch of the Union) is appointed by the two bodies acting together. Democratic legitimacy within the EU can be compared with the dual legitimacy provided for in a federal polity, such as the USA, where there are two independent sources of democratic legitimacy, the House of Representatives and the Senate, and, to become law, decisions must be approved both by one institution representing the people as a whole and by a separate body representing the peoples of the individual states.\n\nThe German Constitutional Court referred to a \"structural democratic deficit\" inherent in the construction of the European Union. It found that the decision-making processes in the EU remained largely those of an international organisation, which would ordinarily be based on the principle of the equality of states and that the principle of equality of states and the principle of equality of citizens cannot be reconciled in a \"Staatenverbund\". In other words, in a supranational union or confederation (which is not a federal state) there is a problem of how to reconcile the principle of equality \"among\" nation states, which applies to international (intergovernmental) organisations, and the principle of equality among citizens, which applies \"within\" states. A 2014 report from the British Electoral Reform Society wrote that \"[t]his unique institutional structure makes it difficult to apply the usual democratic standards without significant changes of emphasis. Certainly, the principles of representativeness, accountability and democratic engagement are vital, but the protection of the rights of minorities is perhaps especially important. The EU is a political regime that is, in one sense at least, entirely made up of minorities.\"\n\nOne assertion of democratic illegitimacy focuses on the role of the European Commission in initiating legislation. This criticism has, in turn, been criticised, using comparisons with the situation in national governments where few members' bills are ever debated and \"fewer than 15% are ever successfully adopted in any form\", while government proposals \"generally pass without substantial or substantive amendments from the legislature\". The Commission is reestablished every five years. Individual members of the incoming Commission are nominated by national governments and the proposed Commission is (or is not) approved jointly and severally by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. If Parliament passes a vote of censure, the Commission must resign. Such a censure motion has been brought eight times times, but never passed. In 1999, an initial censure motion against the Santer Commission was defeated, awaiting the results of an investigation. When the results of the investigation were published, the Santer Commission resigned, forestalling a second censure motion that was expected to pass with a large majority.\n\nAccording to R. Daniel Kelemen, fragmented power systems like the European Union and the United States may tend to produce more detailed regulations that give member states less discretion in implementation.\n\nIn an attempt to strengthen democratic legitimacy, the Treaty of Lisbon provided that the nomination of the President of the European Commission should \"take account\" of the result of the European parliamentary elections, interpreted by the larger parliamentary groups to mean that the European Council should nominate the candidate (\"Spitzenkandidat\") proposed by the dominant parliamentary group. However, this has also been criticized from the point of view of democratic legitimacy on the grounds that the European Union is not a country and the European Commission is not a government, also having a semi-judicial role that requires it to act as a \"referee\" or \"policeman\" rather than a partisan actor. The fear is that a \"semi-elected\" Commission president might be \"too partisan to retain the trust of national leaders; too powerless to win the loyalty of citizens\". This, too, is seen as a possibly insoluble problem resulting from the European's dual nature, partly an international organization and partly a federation.\n\nThe Electoral Reform Society observed polling evidence from Germany which showed that support for the CDU/CSU (EPP group) ahead of the 2014 European Parliament elections was higher than support for the Social Democrats (S&D group) and that there was little difference between their support in the opinion polls for national and European Parliament elections. This was despite another poll showing that S&D candidate Martin Schulz was more popular among German voters than EPP candidate Jean-Claude Juncker. They concluded that \"this does not suggest that the majority of German voters are treating the contest as a chance to choose a Commission President.\" However, they recommended that the candidate model be kept with \"a clearer set of rules for future elections.\"\n\nOne assertion of democratic illegitimacy focuses on the alleged weakness of the European Parliament. This has been countered by a number of political scientists, who have compared the systems of governance in the European Union with that of the United States, and stated that the alleged powerless or dysfunctional nature of the European Parliament is now a \"myth\". It is argued that there are important differences from national European parliaments, such as the role of committees, bipartisan voting, decentralized political parties, executive-legislative divide and absence of Government-opposition divide. All these traits are considered as signs of weakness or unaccountability, but as these very same traits are found in the US House of Representatives to a lesser or greater degree, the European Parliament is more appropriately compared with the US House of Representatives. In that sense, it is now a powerful parliament, as it is not controlled by a \"governing majority\": Majorities have to be built afresh for each item of legislation by explanation, persuasion and negotiation.\n\nLegislative initiative in the EU rests almost entirely with the Commission, while in member states it is shared between parliament and executive. However, in national parliaments less than 15% of legislative initiatives from individual members of parliament become law in any form when they do not have the backing of the executive, while most proposals by the executive are passed without major amendments in parliament. The European Parliament, on the other hand, can only propose amendments, but these proposals are successful in more than 80% of cases, and even in controversial proposals, the success rate is almost 30%.\n\nLiberal Democrat (ELDR) MEP Chris Davies, says he has far more influence as a member of the European Parliament than he did as an opposition MP in the House of Commons. \"Here I started to have an impact on day one\", \"And there has not been a month since when words I tabled did not end up in legislation.\"\n\nThe low turnout at European elections has been cited as weakening the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament: the BBC commented that in Britain many more votes were cast in an election on the reality show \"Big Brother\" than in the 1999 European Parliament election. On the other hand, the President of the European Parliament [the 'Speaker'] compared the turnout for the European Parliament to the presidential elections in the United States:\n\nIn fact, the figures that are compared, the European Parliament voter turnout from 1999 (49.51%) and the US presidential voter turnout from 1996 (49%) are only marginally different, and the US voter turnout for 1996 was the lowest turnout in the US since 1924 (when it was 48.9%). The turnout in European elections has also been declining every election without exception to a low of 42.54% in 2014.\n\nAccording to Matej Avbelj (Director of the Law Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia), the EU democratic deficit can be viewed as having a formal component (which is likely to be remedied) but also a social component resulting from people's low acceptance of the EU, as evidenced by low voter turnout.\n\nLegal commentators such as Schmidt and Follesdal argue that the European Union lacks politics that individual citizens understand. This flows from the lack of knowledge of political parties and is reinforced by the lack of votes at European Union elections.\n\nVoting in the Council (of relevant Ministers) is usually by qualified majority voting, and sometimes unanimity is required. This means that, for the vast majority of EU legislation, the corresponding national government has usually voted in favour in the Council. To give an example, up to September 2006, out of the 86 pieces of legislation adopted in that year the Government of the United Kingdom had voted in favour of the legislation 84 times, abstained from voting twice and never voted against.\n\nOver time, a number of constitutional changes have been introduced to increase democratic legitimacy:\n\n"}

Yocoboué consists of the Lozoua (Lozwa) and Divo dialects (7,100 and 94,500 speakers), and Lakota the Lakota (Lákota), Abou (Abu), and Vata dialects. The prestige dialect is the Lozoua speech of the town of Guitry.\n\nThe Dida lects have consonant and vowel inventories typical of the Eastern Kru languages. However, tone varies significantly between dialects, or at least between their descriptions. The following phonology is that of Abu Dida, from Miller (2005).\n\nDida has a ten-vowel system: nine vowels distinguished by \"tenseness\", likely either pharyngealization or supra-glottal phonation (contraction of the larynx) of the type described as retracted tongue root, plus an uncommon mid-central vowel .\n\nThe non-contracted vowels are , and the contracted vowels . (These could be analyzed as , but here are transcribed with lower vowels to reflect their phonetic realization. There is no tense contrast with the low vowel.) The formants of the tense vowels show them to be lower than their non-tense counterparts: the formants of the highest tense vowels overlap the formants of the non-tense mid vowels, but there is visible tension in the lips and throat when these are enunciated carefully.\n\nDida has a number of diphthongs, which have the same number of tonal distinctions as simple vowels. All start with the higher vowels, , and except for , both elements are either contracted or non-contracted, so the pharyngealization is here transcribed after the second element of the vowel. Examples are \"bottle\" (from English), \"get stuck\", and \"little bone\".\n\nDida also has nasal vowels, but they are not common and it is not clear how many. Examples are \"nothing\", \"chin\", \"25 cents\" (from English \"pound\"). In diphthongs, nasalization shows up primarily on the second element of the vowel.\n\nVowel length is not distinctive, apart from phonesthesia (as in \"nothing\"), morphemic contractions, and shortened grammatical words, such as the modal \"will\" (compare its likely lexical source \"get\").\n\nThe consonants are typical for Eastern Kru:\n\nSyllables may be vowel only, consonant-vowel, or consonant--vowel. is a lateral approximant initially, a lateral flap between vowels and after most consonants ( \"country\"), but a central tap after alveolars ( \"blood\"). After a nasal (), it is itself nasalized, and sounds like a short \"n.\" There is a short epenthetic vowel between the initial consonant and the flap, which takes the quality of the syllabic vowel that follows ( \"country\"). Flap clusters occur with all consonants, even the approximants ( \"top\"), apart from the alveolar sonorants and the marginal consonant , which is only attested in the syllable .\n\nWhen emphasized, zero-onset words may take an initial , and initial approximants may become fricated . becomes palatalized before high front vowels, or when emphasized.\n\nDida uses tone as a grammatical device. Morpho-tonology plays a greater role in verb and pronominal paradigms than it does in nouns, and perhaps because of this, Dida verbs utilize a simpler tone system than nouns do: Noun roots have four lexically contrastive tones, subject pronouns have three, and verb roots have just two word tones.\n\nThere are three level tones in Abou Dida: , , and , with about twice as common as the other two. Speaker intuition hears six contour tones: rising and falling . (The falling tones only reach register at the end of a prosodic unit; otherwise the low falling tone is realized as a simple low tone.) However, some of these only occur in morphologically complex words, such as perfective verbs.\n\nMonosyllabic nouns contrast four tones: and : \"egg\", \"leopard\", \"buffalo\", \"arrow\", with and being the most frequent.\n\n"}

The source material of the language appears to have been derived from Philippine languages (particularly Tagalog) and Romance languages. It has its own script, Enchan, which appears to be based on Baybayin. Three songs in the language are written by Doctolero, namely \"Asshenti (Love song)\", \"Hade!! (Etheria theme song)\", and \"Ivo (Lireo national anthem)\", which are all sung by Bayang Barrios for the sequel \"Etheria\" in 2006.\n\nEnchanta was created by Suzette Doctolero originally for the Philippine fantasy series Encantadia to make the viewers feel that the world of Encantados be somehow realistic and genuine. Doctolero created its vocabulary from many Indo-European languages with some influences of Philippine languages especially Tagalog. It can be traced from words like \"corre\", to love (from the root \"cor\" meaning heart) and \"avoya\", to travel (voyage). The language is also notable of being spoken as it sounds like its from some kind of European country because of the tone and the phonotactics. Most characters from the Encantadia saga know how to speak Enchanta, but it was Cassiopeia that had spoken the language most in the whole series, from the fact that she is the first \"diwata\" (fairy) of Lireo and ancestor of all the royal-blooded \"diwatas\" of the Queendom.\n\nBelow are the examples of Enchanta words and Phrases, with English and Tagalog Translation\n\nAda — Mother / Nanay Adarde — Come here / Lumapit ka sa akin <br> \nAdnes nesa aduwa iva? — What is the meaning of this?! / Ano ang ibig sabihin nito?! <br>\nAdo — Father / Tatay <br>\nAgape Avi — Excuse me / Paumanhin <br>\nAgoddo — Frog / Palaka <br>\nAldo — Uncle / Tito <br>\nApwe — Sibling / Kapatid <br>\nArksha — Baby / Sanggol <br>\nAshtadi — Violator! / Pasaway! <br>\nAshte Mashte Lesnum (name of a place) — May peace be kept throughout (name of a place). \"Example: Ashte Mashte lesnum Encantadia — May peace be kept throughout Encantadia.\" <br>\nAshti — Aunt / Tita <br>\nAsmar ivi ishi sanbay ivi ivo — I am just astounded at what happened to the infant. <br>\nAsnamon voyanazar — I'm a traveler, Asnamon tree (Encantadia's version of open sesame.

The preparation for the charter was undertaken by the predecessor to the current Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, the Standing Conference of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe because involvement of local and regional government was essential. The actual charter was written in the Parliamentary Assembly based on the Congress' Recommendations. It only applies to languages traditionally used by the nationals of the State Parties (thus excluding languages used by recent immigrants from other states, see immigrant languages), which significantly differ from the majority or official language (thus excluding what the state party wishes to consider as mere local dialects of the official or majority language) and that either have a territorial basis (and are therefore traditionally spoken by populations of regions or areas within the State) or are used by linguistic minorities within the State as a whole (thereby including such languages as Yiddish, Romani and Lemko, which are used over a wide geographic area).\n\nSome states, such as Ukraine and Sweden, have tied the status of minority language to the recognized national minorities, which are defined by ethnic, cultural and/or religious criteria, thereby circumventing the Charter's notion of linguistic minority. \n\nLanguages that are official within regions, provinces or federal units within a State (for example Catalan in Spain) are not classified as official languages of the State and may therefore benefit from the Charter. On the other hand, Ireland has not been able to sign the Charter on behalf of the Irish language (although a minority language) as it is defined as the first official language of the state. The United Kingdom has ratified the Charter in respect to (among other languages) Welsh in Wales, Scots in Scotland, and Irish in Northern Ireland. France, although a signatory, has been constitutionally blocked from ratifying the Charter in respect to the languages of France.\n\nThe charter provides a large number of different actions state parties can take to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages. There are two levels of protection—all signatories must apply the lower level of protection to qualifying languages. Signatories may further declare that a qualifying language or languages will benefit from the higher level of protection, which lists a range of actions from which states must agree to undertake at least 35.\n\nCountries can ratify the charter in respect of its minority languages based on Part II or Part III of the charter, which contain varying principles. Countries can treat languages differently under the charter, for example, in the United Kingdom, the Welsh language is ratified under the general Part II principles as well as the more specific Part III commitments, while the Cornish language is ratified only under Part II.\n\nPart II of the Charter details eight main principles and objectives upon which States must base their policies and legislation. They are seen as a framework for the preservation of the languages concerned.\n\nPart III details comprehensive rules across a number of sectors, that states agree to abide by. Each language to which Part III of the Charter is applied must be specifically named by the government. States must select at least thirty-five of the undertakings in respect of each language. Many provisions contain several options, of varying degrees of stringency, one of which has to be chosen “according to the situation of each language”. The areas from which these specific undertakings must be chosen are as follows:\n\nCountries that have ratified the Charter, and languages for which the ratification was made:\n\n\n"}

In his book, \"Postmetropolis: Critical Studies of Cities and Regions\", he discusses how the contemporary American city has become far more complex than the familiar upperclass vs. middleclass or black vs. white models of society. It has become a fractal city of intensified inequalities and social polarization. The term \"fractal\" gives it the idea of having a fractured social geometry. This is a patterning of \"metropolarities\", or an intensification of socio-economic inequalities, some of which Soja tries to pinpoint and discuss.\n\nWilliam Wilson's location theory tries to give an explanation for the widening poverty and inequality gap. With rise of new technologies in recent decades, the new communication methods have allowed us to process and transmit information over great distances. This has, in a sense, destroyed distance. Distance no longer hinders communication as much as it used to. As a result, many businesses have relocated out of the inner city to the suburbs. Sadly, this leaves many ethnic communities stranded in the deindustrialized inner city. They are unable to take part in the sudden shift to information-based and service-based industry jobs. Both Edward Soja and Saskia Sassen have written on this.\n\nSoja uses Los Angeles as evidence that social inequalities and polarizations in American society \"have\" in fact been increasing, which partly due to globalization and economic restructuring. He describes the \"ethnic quilt\" of L.A., \"a heterogeneous mosaic of new and old ethnicities\". In this, he discusses ethnic niches as well as segregated cityspace, the spatial or geographical concentration of ethnic groups in L.A. Many parts of Los Angeles have experienced rapid demographic transformations in recent decades. Some neighborhoods have been \"shifting from 80 percent white in 1965 to, in many areas, over 90 percent Latino today.\" Soja concludes by stating that \"... Los Angeles remains one of the most segregated urban regions in the country.\"\n\nNevertheless, there are places that show exceptional ethnic diversity and equality, such as the cities of Gardena and Carson in Los Angeles County that have had a perfectly even mix of white, black, Latino, and Asian percentages.\n\nSoja urges us, in political struggles, to look beyond the simple equality politics of class, race and gender. Instead, we should look to \"more cross-cutting and inclusive foundations of solidarity, collective consciousness, and coalition building\".\n\n"}

He was born in Tåssjö (now in Ängelholm Municipality) in Skåne and died at Ribbingsfors Manor in northern Västergötland.\n\nBengtsson began as a poet, with his debut work \"Tärningskast\" (Throwing Dice) published in 1923. In 1929 he published an essay collection titled \"Litteratörer och Militärer\" (Writers and Warriors) with contributions on François Villon, Walter Scott, Joseph Conrad, and Stonewall Jackson. His essays mainly dealt with literary and historical subjects. A selection was translated into English in 1950 and published as \"A Walk to an Ant Hill and Other Essays\".\n\nHis biography on the Swedish king Charles XII (\"Karl XII:s levnad\") 1932 is his magnum opus. He describes the king through excerpts from contemporary diaries by officers and common soldiers, and from a wealth of quotes from the published literature. Bengtsson's work draws heavily on the biography of Charles XII by Voltaire published in 1731, thirteen years after the king’s death.\n\nLater, Bengtsson became widely known for his Viking saga novel \"Röde Orm\" (\"The Long Ships\"), published in two parts in 1941 and 1945. The hero Orm, later called Röde Orm (Red Snake) because of his red beard, is kidnapped as a boy onto a raiding ship and leads an exciting life in the Mediterranean area around the year 1000 AD. Later, he makes an expedition eastward into what is now Russia. \"The Long Ships\" was later adapted into a film.\n\nBengtsson once said: \"Joan of Arc, Charles XII, and Garibaldi are the persons I would like to meet - for them the truth was more important than intrigues.\"\n\nBengtsson married Gerda Fineman in 1939. He studied at the University of Lund from 1912, receiving a licentiate degree in English literature in 1930.\n\n"}

{"id": "31528719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31528719", "title": "Gender polarization", "text": "Gender polarization\n\nGender polarization is a concept in sociology by American psychologist Sandra Bem which states that societies tend to define femininity and masculinity as polar opposite genders, such that male-acceptable behaviors and attitudes are not seen as appropriate for women, and vice versa. The theory is an extension of the sex and gender distinction in sociology in which sex refers to the biological differences between men and women, while gender refers to the cultural differences between them, such that \"gender\" describes the \"socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women\". According to Bem, gender polarization begins when natural sex differences are exaggerated in culture; for example, women have less hair than men, and men have more muscles than women, but these physical differences are exaggerated culturally when women remove hair from their faces and legs and armpits, and when men engage in body building exercises to emphasize their muscle mass. She explained that gender polarization goes further, when cultures construct \"differences from scratch to make the sexes even more different from one another than they would otherwise be\", perhaps by dictating specific hair styles for men and women, which are noticeably distinct, or separate clothing styles for men and women. When genders become polarized, according to the theory, there is no overlap, no shared behaviors or attitudes between men and women; rather, they are distinctly opposite. She argued that these distinctions become so \"all-encompassing\" that they \"pervade virtually every aspect of human existence\", not just hairstyles and clothing but how men and women express emotion and experience sexual desire. She argued that male-female differences are \"superimposed on so many aspects of the social world that a cultural connection is thereby forged between sex and virtually every other aspect of human experience\".\n\nBem saw gender polarization as an organizing principle upon which many of the basic institutions of a society are built. For example, rules based on gender polarization have been codified into law. In western society in the fairly recent past, such rules have prevented women from voting, holding political office, going to school, owning property, serving in the armed forces, entering certain professions, or playing specific sports. For example, the first modern Olympics was a male-only sporting event from which women were excluded, and this has been identified as a prime example of gender polarization. In addition, the term has been applied to literary criticism.\n\nAccording to Scott Coltrane and Michele Adams, gender polarization begins early in childhood when girls are encouraged to prefer pink over blue, and when boys are encouraged to prefer toy trucks over dolls, and the male-female distinction is communicated to children in countless ways. Children learn by observing others and by direct tutelage what they \"can and cannot do in terms of gendered behavior\", according to Elizabeth Lindsey and Walter Zakahi. Bem argued that gender polarization defines mutually exclusive scripts for being male and female. The scripts can have a powerful influence on how a person develops; for example, if a person is a male, then he will likely grow to develop specific ways of looking at the world, with certain behaviors seen as 'masculine', and learn to dress, walk, talk, and even think in a socially-approved way for men. Further, any deviation from these scripts was seen as problematic, possibly defined as \"immoral acts\" which flout religious customs, or seen as \"psychologically pathological\". Bem argued that because of past polarization, women were often restricted to family-oriented roles in the private sphere, while men were seen as professional representatives in the public sphere. Cultures vary substantially by what is considered to be appropriate for masculine and feminine roles, and by how emotions are expressed.\n\n"}

She was a niece of Martin Browne, whose townhouse doorway, the Browne doorway, now stands in Eyre Square. Andrew was a first cousin of Sir Dominick Browne, former Mayor of Galway and the father of Valentine Browne, OFM, Provincial of Franciscans 1629-1635. Her elder brother, Francis, later joined the Franciscans, while Mary and her sister Catherine joined the Poor Clares in 1632. In that year her father Andrew was elected one of the town sheriffs but refused to take the Oath of Supremacy, as had his father in 1609, and thus was not sworn in.\n\nFollowing their banishment from Dublin in November 1630, the Poor Clares removed to Bethleham, in what was then the townland of Bleanphuttogue, parish of Kilkenny West, County Westmeath, a remote area on the shores of Lough Ree some eight miles (13 km) north-west of Athlone and four and a half miles southwest of Ballymahon, County Longford. Within a few years there were sixty members.\n\nFollowing a request from some citizens of Galway, twelve sister and two novices moved there during or immediately after January 1642. Mary and Catherine, who were professed at Bethlehem in 1633, were among the group. The Abbess at Bethleham was Mother Cicely Dillon, a sister of Sir James Dillon (officer) and both children of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon. At Galway the Abbess was, successively, Mary Gabriel Martyn, Mary Clare Kennedy, and Mary during 1647-50, being succeeded by her sister Catherine. The convent was located in or near what is now St. Augustine Street.\n\nIn her first year, Mary commissioned Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh to complete the work of translating \"The Rule of St. Clare\" and related documents into Irish. This had been begun prior to October 1636 by Father Aodh O Raghailligh and Séamus Ó Siaghail. It was transcribed in mid-October 1636 by Brother Mícheál Ó Cléirigh. Mac Fhirbhisigh translated and transcribed the remaining sections (some two-thirds of the total) from English into Irish and \"designed it to be a continuation of the manuscript executed by Ó Cléirigh\". It was completed on 8 December 1657, and is now Royal Irish Academy MS D i 2.\n\nHelena Concannon remarks that \"It is additional proof of Mother Bonaventure's keen interest in Irish to find that she had brought this MS with her from Bethleham\". The fact that she commissioned Mac Fhirbhisigh to complete the work is a very interesting marker of the high status of the Irish language, all the more surprising in a convent twelve of whose members were of Old English stock.\n\nWhile Abbess, Mother Mary oversaw plans for founding a daughter-house of the Galway convent at Loughrea. The foundation document, now preserved in the Poor Clare archives in Galway, led to the house's apparent existence in 1649-50, but due to the warfare which soon arose in the county seems to have been short-lived.\n\nIn the summer of 1649, Mother Mary sent a petition to the \"Mayors, Sheriffs, Free Burgesses and Commonalty of the Towne of Galway\" stating that, due to excessive rent, they would be obliged to leave their current home at the end of the lease, which occurred the following May. Therefore, she petitioned that \"you may be pleased to grant them sufficient room for building a monastery and rooms convenient thereunto a garden and orchard in the next island adjoining to the bridge Illaun Altenagh.\" The Mayor and Recorder recommended the grant on 1 July and on 10 July the Corporation unanimously agreed and granted the petition. The convent on Oileán Ealtanach - now called Nun's Island - was \"a good large and spacious house with other conveniences with the cost and charge of two hundred and odd pounds of the Sisters' portions in timber and other materials\".\n\nThough at least one new sister was professed as late as 1652, the years during and after the move to Nun's Island was marked by a visitation of plague, a nine-month siege, warfare and famine. Galway surrendered to Sir Charles Coote and his army in April 1652, marking the advent of a very different regime. In January 1653 an edict \"commanding all nuns of whatsoever condition, to marry or quit the kingdom.\" Most of the Galway community travelled by ship to Spain; Mother Cicely Dillon died en route. Mary's sister, Mother Catherine Bernard Browne, died in Madrid in 1654.\n\nDuring her years of exile in Madrid, Mother Mary wrote \"a huge work, in quarto, in the Irish language.\" Written c. 1670 at the convent of El Cavallero de Garcia, \"it is particularly regrettable that the original of the great work is no longer extant, since a prose work in Irish by a pre-twentieth century female author would be a very rare thing indeed.\"\n\nWhile almost the entire of the records of El Cavallero de Garcia, including this book, are now thought to be lost, there is a strong suggestion that the \"narrative\" which opens the annals of the Poor Clares of Galway could be an English translation of the second tractae of her book. Mother Mary's work comprised the following:\n\n\nCelsus O'Brien quotes the Poor Clare Annalist: \"The Third Abbess of said Convent, Mary Bonaventure (alias) Browne, was a very good holy and perfect religious Sister, and was endowed with many rare virtues, as obedience, poverty, chastity, humility and charity. She was prudent and wise, well spoken in English, Irish and Spanish. She was the mirror and looking glass of religious observance that belonged to her Rule and status all of her lifetime. She left a True Chronicle written under her own hand, which she sent to this convent of Saint Clare, Galway, and a Remonstrance, a chalice, a holy curious relic, many pictures, books, ornaments, and other fine things fitting for the alter and Divine Service. All the aforesaid things were lost and burnt in the late wars, 1691.\"\n\nIn addition, she is said to have written a life, in English, of her sister, Catherine Browne. The dowry of Catherine - \"due by bond of Andrew Browne and Sir Dominick Browne, knight, was put in trust for them in the names of Patrick D'Arcy and Richard Óge Martyn, Esq.\" Sir Dominick's wife was a sister of Darcy, while he and Richard Martyn were married to two of the sisters and heiress, Mary and Magdalene,who were daughters of Sir Peter French.\n\nHer year of death is unknown, but she is believed to have been after 1670, and before 1691.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22667", "title": "Old English", "text": "Old English\n\nOld English (, ), or Anglo-Saxon, is the earliest historical form of the English language, spoken in England and southern and eastern Scotland in the early Middle Ages. It was brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers probably in the mid-5th century, and the first Old English literary works date from the mid-7th century. After the Norman conquest of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, as the language of the upper classes by Anglo-Norman, a relative of French. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as Middle English.\n\nOld English developed from a set of Anglo-Frisian or Ingvaeonic dialects originally spoken by Germanic tribes traditionally known as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes. As the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in England, their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain: Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by Roman invasion. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong Old Norse influence due to Scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century.\n\nOld English is one of the West Germanic languages, and its closest relatives are Old Frisian and Old Saxon. Like other old Germanic languages, it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study. Old English grammar is quite similar to that of modern German: nouns, adjectives, pronouns and verbs have many inflectional endings and forms, and word order is much freer. The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a runic system, but from about the 9th century this was replaced by a version of the Latin alphabet.\n\n\"Englisc\", which the term \"English\" is derived from, means 'pertaining to the Angles'. In Old English, this word was derived from \"Angles\" (one of the Germanic tribes who conquered parts of Great Britain in the 5th century). During the 9th century, all invading Germanic tribes were referred to as \"Englisc\". It has been hypothesised that the Angles acquired their name because their land on the coast of Jutland (now mainland Denmark) resembled a fishhook. Proto-Germanic also had the meaning of 'narrow', referring to the shallow waters near the coast. That word ultimately goes back to Proto-Indo-European \"\", also meaning 'narrow'.\n\nAnother theory is that the derivation of 'narrow' is the more likely connection to angling (as in fishing), which itself stems from a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root meaning \"bend, angle\". The semantic link is the fishing hook, which is curved or bent at an angle. In any case, the Angles may have been called such because they were a fishing people or were originally descended from such, and therefore England would mean 'land of the fishermen', and English would be 'the fishermen's language'.\n\nOld English was not static, and its usage covered a period of 700 years, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in the 5th century to the late 11th century, some time after the Norman invasion. While indicating that the establishment of dates is an arbitrary process, Albert Baugh dates Old English from 450 to 1150, a period of full inflections, a synthetic language. Perhaps around 85 per cent of Old English words are no longer in use, but those that survived are basic elements of Modern English vocabulary.\n\nOld English is a West Germanic language, developing out of Ingvaeonic (also known as North Sea Germanic) dialects from the 5th century. It came to be spoken over most of the territory of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which became the Kingdom of England. This included most of present-day England, as well as part of what is now southeastern Scotland, which for several centuries belonged to the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Other parts of the island – Wales and most of Scotland – continued to use Celtic languages, except in the areas of Scandinavian settlements where Old Norse was spoken. Celtic speech also remained established in certain parts of England: Medieval Cornish was spoken all over Cornwall and in adjacent parts of Devon, while Cumbric survived perhaps to the 12th century in parts of Cumbria, and Welsh may have been spoken on the English side of the Anglo-Welsh border. Norse was also widely spoken in the parts of England which fell under Danish law.\n\nAnglo-Saxon literacy developed after Christianisation in the late 7th century. The oldest surviving text of Old English literature is \"Cædmon's Hymn\", composed between 658 and 680. There is a limited corpus of runic inscriptions from the 5th to 7th centuries, but the oldest coherent runic texts (notably the Franks Casket) date to the 8th century. The Old English Latin alphabet was introduced around the 9th century.\nWith the unification of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (outside the Danelaw) by Alfred the Great in the later 9th century, the language of government and literature became standardised around the West Saxon dialect (Early West Saxon). Alfred advocated education in English alongside Latin, and had many works translated into the English language; some of them, such as Pope Gregory I's treatise \"Pastoral Care\", appear to have been translated by Alfred himself. In Old English, typical of the development of literature, poetry arose before prose, but King Alfred the Great (871 to 901) chiefly inspired the growth of prose.\n\nA later literary standard, dating from the later 10th century, arose under the influence of Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester, and was followed by such writers as the prolific Ælfric of Eynsham (\"the Grammarian\"). This form of the language is known as the \"Winchester standard\", or more commonly as Late West Saxon. It is considered to represent the \"classical\" form of Old English. It retained its position of prestige until the time of the Norman Conquest, after which English ceased for a time to be of importance as a literary language.\n\nThe history of Old English can be subdivided into:\n\nThe Old English period is followed by Middle English (12th to 15th century), Early Modern English (c. 1480 to 1650) and finally Modern English (after 1650).\n\nOld English should not be regarded as a single monolithic entity, just as Modern English is also not monolithic. It emerged over time out of the many dialects and languages of the colonising tribes, and it is only towards the later Anglo-Saxon period that these can be considered to have constituted a single national language. Even then, Old English continued to exhibit much local and regional variation, remnants of which remain in Modern English dialects.\n\nThe four main dialectal forms of Old English were Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish, and West Saxon. Mercian and Northumbrian are together referred to as \"Anglian\". In terms of geography the Northumbrian region lay north of the Humber River; the Mercian lay north of the Thames and South of the Humber River; West Saxon lay south and southwest of the Thames; and the smallest, Kentish region lay southeast of the Thames, a small corner of England. The Kentish region, settled by the Jutes from Jutland, has the scantiest literary remains.\n\nEach of these four dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island. Of these, Northumbria south of the Tyne, and most of Mercia, were overrun by the Vikings during the 9th century. The portion of Mercia that was successfully defended, and all of Kent, were then integrated into Wessex under Alfred the Great.\nFrom that time on, the West Saxon dialect (then in the form now known as Early West Saxon) became standardised as the language of government, and as the basis for the many works of literature and religious materials produced or translated from Latin in that period.\n\nThe later literary standard known as Late West Saxon (see History, above), although centred in the same region of the country, appears not to have been directly descended from Alfred's Early West Saxon. For example, the former diphthong tended to become monophthongised to in EWS, but to in LWS.\n\nDue to the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions, there is relatively little written record of the non-Wessex dialects after Alfred's unification. Some Mercian texts continued to be written, however, and the influence of Mercian is apparent in some of the translations produced under Alfred's programme, many of which were produced by Mercian scholars. Other dialects certainly continued to be spoken, as is evidenced by the continued variation between their successors in Middle and Modern English. In fact, what would become the standard forms of Middle English and of Modern English are descended from Mercian rather than West Saxon, while Scots developed from the Northumbrian dialect. It was once claimed that, owing to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the dialect of Somerset.\n\nFor details of the sound differences between the dialects, see Phonological history of Old English (dialects).\n\nThe language of the Anglo-Saxon settlers appears not to have been significantly affected by the native British Celtic languages which it largely displaced. The number of Celtic loanwords introduced into the language is very small. However, various suggestions have been made concerning possible influence that Celtic may have had on developments in English syntax in the post-Old English period, such as the regular progressive construction and analytic word order, as well as the eventual development of the periphrastic auxiliary verb \"do\".\n\nOld English contained a certain number of loanwords from Latin, which was the scholarly and diplomatic \"lingua franca\" of Western Europe. It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the borrowing of individual Latin words based on which patterns of sound change they have undergone. Some Latin words had already been borrowed into the Germanic languages before the ancestral Angles and Saxons left continental Europe for Britain. More entered the language when the Anglo-Saxons were converted to Christianity and Latin-speaking priests became influential. It was also through Irish Christian missionaries that the Latin alphabet was introduced and adapted for the writing of Old English, replacing the earlier runic system. Nonetheless, the largest transfer of Latin-based (mainly Old French) words into English occurred after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and thus in the Middle English rather than the Old English period.\n\nAnother source of loanwords was Old Norse, which came into contact with Old English via the Scandinavian rulers and settlers in the Danelaw from the late 9th century, and during the rule of Cnut and other Danish kings in the early 11th century. Many place-names in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the West Saxon dialect, away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in Middle English texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains a great many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence.\n\nThe influence of Old Norse certainly helped move English from a synthetic language along the continuum to a more analytic word order, and Old Norse most likely made a greater impact on the English language than any other language. The eagerness of Vikings in the Danelaw to communicate with their southern Anglo-Saxon neighbours produced a friction that led to the erosion of the complicated inflectional word-endings. Simeon Potter notes: \"No less far-reaching was the influence of Scandinavian upon the inflexional endings of English in hastening that wearing away and leveling of grammatical forms which gradually spread from north to south. It was, after all, a salutary influence. The gain was greater than the loss. There was a gain in directness, in clarity, and in strength.\"\n\nThe strength of the Viking influence on Old English appears from the fact that the indispensable elements of the language – pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal adverbs (like \"hence\" and \"together\"), conjunctions and prepositions – show the most marked Danish influence; the best evidence of Scandinavian influence appears in the extensive word borrowings for, as Jespersen indicates, no texts exist in either Scandinavia or in Northern England from this time to give certain evidence of an influence on syntax. The change to Old English from Old Norse was substantive, pervasive, and of a democratic character. Old Norse and Old English resembled each other closely like cousins and with some words in common, they roughly understood each other; in time the inflections melted away and the analytic pattern emerged. It is most \"important to recognize that in many words the English and Scandinavian language differed chiefly in their inflectional elements. The body of the word was so nearly the same in the two languages that only the endings would put obstacles in the way of mutual understanding. In the mixed population which existed in the Danelaw these endings must have led to much confusion, tending gradually to become obscured and finally lost.\" This blending of peoples and languages resulted in \"simplifying English grammar\".\n\nThe inventory of classical Old English (Late West Saxon) surface phones, as usually reconstructed, is as follows.\nThe sounds enclosed in parentheses in the chart above are not considered to be phonemes:\n\nThe above system is largely similar to that of Modern English, except that (and for most speakers) have generally been lost, while the voiced affricate and fricatives (now also including ) have become independent phonemes, as has .\nThe mid front rounded vowels had merged into unrounded before the Late West Saxon period. During the 11th century such vowels arose again, as monophthongisations of the diphthongs , but quickly merged again with in most dialects.\n\nThe exact pronunciation of the West Saxon close diphthongs, spelt , is disputed; it may have been . Other dialects may have had different systems of diphthongs; for example, Anglian dialects retained , which had merged with in West Saxon.\n\nFor more on dialectal differences, see Phonological history of Old English (dialects).\n\nSome of the principal sound changes occurring in the pre-history and history of Old English were the following:\n\nFor more details of these processes, see the main article, linked above. For sound changes before and after the Old English period, see Phonological history of English.\n\nNouns decline for five cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental; three genders: masculine, feminine, neuter; and two numbers: singular, and plural; and are strong or weak. The instrumental is vestigial and only used with the masculine and neuter singular and often replaced by the dative. Only pronouns and strong adjectives retain separate instrumental forms. There is also sparse early Northumbrian evidence of a sixth case: the locative. Adjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, number, and strong, or weak forms. Pronouns and sometimes participles agree in case, gender, and number. First-person and second-person personal pronouns occasionally distinguish dual-number forms. The definite article and its inflections serve as a definite article (\"the\"), a demonstrative adjective (\"that\"), and demonstrative pronoun. Other demonstratives are (\"this\"), and (\"yon\"). These words inflect for case, gender, number. Adjectives have both strong and weak sets of endings, weak ones being used when a definite or possessive determiner is also present.\n\nVerbs conjugate for three persons: first, second, and third; two numbers: singular, plural; two tenses: present, and past; three moods: indicative, subjunctive, and imperative; and are strong (exhibiting ablaut) or weak (exhibiting a dental suffix). Verbs have two infinitive forms: bare, and bound; and two participles: present, and past. The subjunctive has past and present forms. Finite verbs agree with subjects in person, and number. The future tense, passive voice, and other aspects are formed with compounds.\nAdpositions are mostly before but often after their object. If the object of an adposition is marked in the dative case, an adposition may conceivably be located anywhere in the sentence.\n\nRemnants of the Old English case system in Modern English are in the forms of a few pronouns (such as \"I/me/mine\", \"she/her\", \"who/whom/whose\") and in the possessive ending \"-'s\", which derives from the masculine and neuter genitive ending \"-es\". The modern English plural ending \"-(e)s\" derives from the Old English \"-as\", but the latter applied only to \"strong\" masculine nouns in the nominative and accusative cases; different plural endings were used in other instances. Old English nouns had grammatical gender, while modern English has only natural gender. Pronoun usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender when those conflicted, as in the case of , a neuter noun referring to a female person.\n\nIn Old English's verbal compound constructions are the beginnings of the compound tenses of Modern English. Old English verbs include strong verbs, which form the past tense by altering the root vowel, and weak verbs, which use a suffix such as . As in Modern English, and peculiar to the Germanic languages, the verbs formed two great classes: weak (regular), and strong (irregular). Like today, Old English had fewer strong verbs, and many of these have over time decayed into weak forms. Then, as now, dental suffixes indicated the past tense of the weak verbs, as in \"work\" and \"worked\".\n\nOld English syntax is similar to that of modern English. Some differences are consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection, allowing freer word order.\n\nOld English was first written in runes, using the futhorc – a rune set derived from the Germanic 24-character elder futhark, extended by five more runes used to represent Anglo-Saxon vowel sounds, and sometimes by several more additional characters. From around the 9th century, the runic system came to be supplanted by a (minuscule) half-uncial script of the Latin alphabet introduced by Irish Christian missionaries. This was replaced by insular script, a cursive and pointed version of the half-uncial script. This was used until the end of the 12th century when continental Carolingian minuscule (also known as \"Caroline\") replaced the insular.\n\nThe Latin alphabet of the time still lacked the letters and , and there was no as distinct from ; moreover native Old English spellings did not use , or . The remaining 20 Latin letters were supplemented by four more: (, modern \"ash\") and (, now called eth or edh), which were modified Latin letters, and thorn and wynn , which are borrowings from the futhorc. A few letter pairs were used as digraphs, representing a single sound. Also used was the Tironian note (a character similar to the digit 7) for the conjunction \"and\", and a thorn with a crossbar through the ascender for the pronoun . Macrons over vowels were originally used not to mark long vowels (as in modern editions), but to indicate stress, or as abbreviations for a following \"m\" or \"n\".\n\nModern editions of Old English manuscripts generally introduce some additional conventions. The modern forms of Latin letters are used, including in place of the insular G, for long S, and others which may differ considerably from the insular script, notably , and . Macrons are used to indicate long vowels, where usually no distinction was made between long and short vowels in the originals. (In some older editions an acute accent mark was used for consistency with Old Norse conventions.) Additionally, modern editions often distinguish between velar and palatal and by placing dots above the palatals: , . The letter wynn is usually replaced with , but , eth and thorn are normally retained (except when eth is replaced by thorn).\n\nIn contrast with Modern English orthography, that of Old English was reasonably regular, with a mostly predictable correspondence between letters and phonemes. There were not usually any silent letters—in the word \"cniht\", for example, both the and were pronounced, unlike the and in the modern \"knight\". The following table lists the Old English letters and digraphs together with the phonemes they represent, using the same notation as in the Phonology section above.\n\nDoubled consonants are geminated; the geminate fricatives /, and cannot be voiced.\n\nOld English literature, though more abundant than literature of the continent before AD 1000, is nonetheless scant. The pagan and Christian streams mingle in Old English, one of the richest and most significant bodies of literature preserved among the early Germanic peoples. In his supplementary article to the 1935 posthumous edition of Bright's \"Anglo-Saxon Reader\", Dr. James Hulbert writes:\n\nSome of the most important surviving works of Old English literature are \"Beowulf\", an epic poem; the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", a record of early English history; the Franks Casket, an inscribed early whalebone artefact; and Cædmon's Hymn, a Christian religious poem. There are also a number of extant prose works, such as sermons and saints' lives, biblical translations, and translated Latin works of the early Church Fathers, legal documents, such as laws and wills, and practical works on grammar, medicine, and geography. Still, poetry is considered the heart of Old English literature. Nearly all Anglo-Saxon authors are anonymous, with a few exceptions, such as Bede and Cædmon. Cædmon, the earliest English poet we know by name, served as a lay brother in the monastery at Whitby.\n\nThe first example is taken from the opening lines of the folk-epic \"Beowulf\", a poem of some 3,000 lines and the single greatest work of Old English. This passage describes how Hrothgar's legendary ancestor Scyld was found as a baby, washed ashore, and adopted by a noble family. The translation is literal and represents the original poetic word order. As such, it is not typical of Old English prose. The modern cognates of original words have been used whenever practical to give a close approximation of the feel of the original poem.\n\nThe words in brackets are implied in the Old English by noun case and the bold words in brackets are explanations of words that have slightly different meanings in a modern context. Notice how \"what\" is used by the poet where a word like \"lo\" or \"behold\" would be expected. This usage is similar to \"what-ho!\", both an expression of surprise and a call to attention.\n\nEnglish poetry is based on stress and alliteration. In alliteration, the first consonant in a word alliterates with the same consonant at the beginning of another word, as with and . Vowels alliterate with any other vowel, as with and . In the text below, the letters that alliterate are bolded.\n\nA semi-fluent translation in Modern English would be:\n\nLo! We have heard of majesty of the Spear-Danes, of those nation-kings in the days of yore, and how those noblemen promoted zeal. Scyld Scefing took away mead-benches from bands of enemies, from many tribes; he terrified earls. Since he was first found destitute (he gained consolation for that) he grew under the heavens, prospered in honours, until each of those who lived around him over the sea had to obey him, give him tribute. That was a good king!\n\nThis text of the Lord's Prayer is presented in the standardised West Saxon literary dialect, with added macrons for vowel length, markings for probable palatalised consonants, modern punctuation, and the replacement of the letter ƿynn with w.\n\nThis is a proclamation from King Cnut the Great to his earl Thorkell the Tall and the English people written in AD 1020. Unlike the previous two examples, this text is prose rather than poetry. For ease of reading, the passage has been divided into sentences while the pilcrows represent the original division.\n\nThe earliest history of Old English lexicography lies in the Anglo-Saxon period itself, when English-speaking scholars created English glosses on Latin texts. At first these were often marginal or interlinear glosses, but soon came to be gathered into word-lists such as the Épinal-Erfurt, Leiden and Corpus Glossaries. Over time, these word-lists were consolidated and alphabeticised to create extensive Latin-Old English glossaries with some of the character of dictionaries, such as the Cleopatra Glossaries, the Harley Glossary and the Brussels Glossary. In some cases, the material in these glossaries continued to be circulated and updated in Middle English glossaries, such as the Durham Plant-Name Glossary and the Laud Herbal Glossary.\n\nOld English lexicography was revived in the early modern period, drawing heavily on Anglo-Saxons' own glossaries. The major publication at this time was William Somner's \"Dictionarium Saxonico-Latino-Anglicum\". The next substantial Old English dictionary was Joseph Bosworth's \"Anglo-Saxon Dictionary\" of 1838.\n\nIn modern scholarship, the following dictionaries remain current:\n\n\nThough focused on later periods, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"Middle English Dictionary\", \"Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue\", and \"Historical Thesaurus of English\" all also include material relevant to Old English.\n\nLike other historical languages, Old English has been used by scholars and enthusiasts of later periods to create texts either imitating Anglo-Saxon literature or deliberately transferring it to a different cultural context. Examples include Alistair Campbell and J. R. R. Tolkien. Ransom Riggs uses several Old English words, such as syndrigast(singular, peculia), ymbryne(period, cycle), etc., dubbed as \"Old Peculiar\" ones.\n\nA number of websites devoted to Modern Paganism and historical reenactment offer reference material and forums promoting the active use of Old English. There is also an . However, one investigation found that many Neo-Old English texts published online bear little resemblance to the historical language and have many basic grammatical mistakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In contrast, a closed text leads the reader to one intended interpretation.\n\nThe concept of the open text comes from Umberto Eco's collection of essays \"The Role of the Reader\", but it is also derivative of Roland Barthes's distinction between 'readerly' (lisible) and 'writerly' (scriptible) texts as set out in his 1968 essay, \"The Death of the Author\".\n\nIn this essay, Umberto Eco describes a special kind of musical works that can be organized and re-organized by the performers before they are played to the audience. He then applied this idea of \"open works\" to literary texts and other works of art.\n\nEvery work of art can be read, according to Eco, in three distinct ways: the moral, the allegorical and the anagogical. Each is not only distinct but can be fully anticipated and directed by the author (or the artist) of the work. An example of this kind of reading is found in the stories by Kafka, in which his symbolic actions cannot be read in one definitive way; each reading will end up with similar and multiple meanings.\n\nThe reader will read a certain work differently every time, depending on his/her emotional state, physical state and political world view. We can find an example of this in plays written by Brecht , which are \"open\" in the same way that an argument between two people is open: both sides (the actors and the viewers) want and anticipate a solution at the end, but no solution ever comes, leaving us to wander to find meaning.\n\nUmberto Eco makes a distinction between these kind of works, which are \"open\" in their interpretation, to the musical works from the beginning, which are open in their structural sense. These kind of \"openness\" is not only for musical works, it might be any kind of artistic work (painting, poem, performance etc.)\n\nThis kind of \"openness\" is derived from the science of the time, he says. When people believed in a geocentric world, they expected every work of art to have only one definitive interpretation, but as people found out about the universe and the magnitude of stars in the sky and their hierarchy, they began to expect more ideas to be interpreted from every work.\n\nHe continues by comparing open works to Quantum mechanics, and he arrives at the conclusion that open works are more like Einstein's idea of the universe, which is governed by precise laws but seems random at first. The artist in those open works arranges the work carefully so it could be re-organized by another but still keep the original voice or intent of the artist.\n\nEvery work can be read in infinite ways, depending on an individual's state of mind and perspective, and it also depends on a third person intervention, either the players of the orchestra or the curator at the museum. Eco understand the difficulties with this perspective, but he ends by saying that this article, as all works, is still a \"work in movement\", an \"open work\" and still a \"work in progress\".\n\n"}

Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys or on the doorsteps of mountains, as coastal plains, and as plateaus or uplands.\n\nIn a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides, but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains, or by cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometimes termed a gap). Coastal plains would mostly rise from sea level until they run into elevated features such as mountains or plateaus. \n\nPlains are one of the major landforms on earth, where they are present on all continents, and would cover more than one-third of the world’s land area. Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains. Plains would generally be under the grassland (temperate or subtropical), steppe (semi-arid), savannah (tropical) or tundra (polar) biomes. In a few instances, deserts and rainforests can also be plains. \n\nPlains in many areas are important for agriculture because where the soils were deposited as sediments they may be deep and fertile, and the flatness facilitates mechanization of crop production; or because they support grasslands which provide good grazing for livestock.\n\nDepositional plains formed by the deposition of materials brought by various agents of transportation such as glaciers, rivers, waves, and wind.

The \"Swastik League\" was an organisation established by M. R. Jayakar.\n\nPramila started her schooling at age 5 and painting was her hobby. The Second World War had started and since Bombay was a part of the British Empire, there were rumours that Bombay could possible be attacked by the Axis powers. As a result, many middle class families from Bombay started sending their families to their ancestral homes in Konkan. Pramila along with her siblings was sent to Malvan and she completed her fourth standard (which was equal to today's eight standard) from the Anant Shivaji Desai Topiwala High School.

In French, for example, regular verbs can be deduced from a single form, the infinitive, and irregular verbs are too random to be systematized under fixed parts. But the concept can be carried over to many languages in which the verbs have some kind of \"regular irregularity\", i.e. irregularity always occurs at the same place in an otherwise regular system. \n\nAlthough the term 'principal part' is usually applied to verbs, the same phenomenon can be found in some languages in nouns and other word types. It is normally restricted to regular verbs, nouns, etc., and applies to languages where the regular paradigm is based on more than one underlying form. It does not cover random irregularities.\n\nIn Latin, most verbs have four principal parts. For example, the verb for \"to carry\" is given as \"portō – portāre – portāvī – portātum\", where \"portō\" is the first-person singular present active indicative (\"I carry\"), \"portāre\" is the present active infinitive (\"to carry\"), \"portāvī\" is the first-person singular perfect active indicative (\"I carried\"), and \"portātum\" is the neuter supine. Most of the verb forms in Latin derive from the first two principal parts: \"portābō\", \"I shall carry\", is derived from the root \"portā-\", taken from the present infinitive. However, all active perfect forms are derived from the third principal part (so \"portāveram\", \"I had carried\", is taken from \"portāv-\") while the perfect participle (\"portātus, portāta, portātum\", \"having been carried\") is derived from the supine and is used to form perfect passive participle with the auxiliary verb \"sum\" (such as \"portātum est\", \"it has been carried\"). The auxiliary verb is often dropped when writing poetry in Latin.\n\nFor many Latin verbs, the principal parts are predictable: \"portō\" shown above uses a single stem, \"port-\", and all principal parts are derived from them with the endings \"-ō – -āre – -āvī – -ātum\". Others have more complicated forms: \"regō\" (\"I rule\") has the perfect form \"rēxī\" and perfect participle \"rēctum\", derived as *\"reg-sī\" and *\"reg-tum\". A handful of verbs, such as \"sum - esse - fuī - futūrum\" (\"to be\") are simply irregular.\n\nA number of verbs have fewer than four principal parts: deponent verbs, such as \"hortŏr – hortāri – hortātus sum\", \"to exhort\", lack a perfect form, as do semi-deponent verbs, such as \"audeō – audēre – ausus sum\", \"to dare\"; in both cases, passive forms are treated as active, so all perfect forms are covered by the perfect participle. A handful of verbs are also defective, including the verb \"ōdī – ōdisse\", \"to hate\", which only has perfect forms derived from a single stem.\n\nVerbs in Ancient Greek have six principal parts: present (I), future (II), aorist (III), perfect (IV), perfect middle (V) and aorist passive (VI), each listed in its first-person singular form:\n\n\nOne principal part can sometimes be predicted from another, but not with any certainty. For some classes of verbs, however, all principal parts can be predicted given the first one.\n\nThe principal parts of an English verb are the infinitive, preterite and past participle. Lists or recitations of principal parts in English often omit the third principal part's auxiliary verb, rendering it identical to its grammatically distinct participial form. For example, the verb \"to take\" has the principal parts \"take–took–(have) taken\". The verb \"to bet\" has \"bet–bet–(have) bet\" and the verb \"to break\" has \"break–broke–(have) broken\". With irregular verbs the simple present 3S (he, she, it) is derived from infinitive+'s' with the exception of: catch-catches, fly-flies and teach-teaches.\n\n \n\nMost verbs are regular enough not to require a knowledge of the principal parts as the preterite and past participle can be easily derived from the infinitive. For example, the verb \"love\" derives all its forms systematically (\"love, loved, loving\"), and since these can all be deduced from the basic form (the citation, dictionary, or lexicographic form, which in English is the bare infinitive), no other principal parts have to be learned. With irregular verbs like the verb \"sing\", on the other hand, the forms \"sang\" and \"(have) sung\" cannot be deduced, so the learner of English must memorize three principal parts, \"sing–sang–(have) sung\". The present 3S (he/she/it) is derived from the infinitive+'s' with the exception of verbs ending in a single -o, or ending in -s, -x, -z or the digraphs -sh, -ch, in which case it is derived from 'infinitive+es'\n\nThere are a handful of verbs in English that are so irregular that the three principal parts are not enough to conjugate them fully requiring four principal parts and to be requires seven principal parts. The present 3S has its own part while the present 1&3S and 123P are derived from the infinitive like regular verbs are. The pronunciation of the 3S cannot be derived from the infinitive.\n\nFor example, the verb \"to be\" has the principal parts \"be–was/were–(have) been\", showing an irregular past tense (\"was\" for the first- and third-person singular, and \"were\" for the rest), and an entirely irregular present tense (using \"am\", \"is\" and \"are\" instead of forms derived from the first principal part \"be\").\n\nRegular and irregular verbs are easily formed from the three of the principal parts (except for highly irregular which have irregular forms in the simple present and simple past). Here is a sample of the many different forms of tenses with examples. \n\n1. PRESENT is formed from the infinitive (without 'to') i.e. to break-break\n2. GERUND is formed from PRESENT+ing i.e. to stop-stopping (a few minor spelling changes))\n\n(See also English verbs, English irregular verbs, English as an additional language.)\"\n\nThe situation in German is very similar to English. Regular verbs require no memorizing of principal parts, since all forms can be deduced from the infinitive. However, some uncertainty may exist as to the choice of the perfect auxiliary, which could be \"haben\" ('to have') or \"sein\" ('to be'). This can be solved by memorizing the infinitive with the third-person singular perfect tense, which some teachers recommend.\n\nStrong verbs and irregular weak verbs are more complicated. As in English, these verbs are usually memorized by means of three principal parts: \"infinitive – third-person singular past tense – third-person singular perfect tense\". \n\nHowever, in order to deduce the full paradigm, learners must also know the \"third-person singular present\" and the \"third-person singular past subjunctive\", which involve some peculiarities. \n\nA small number of verbs have other irregularities, most of which are limited to the forms of the present tense.\n\nThere are four types of principal parts in the Icelandic language, determined by the type of verb:\n\nIcelandic weak verbs have the following principal parts:\nIt is possible to make the present subjunctive mood (þótt ég \"borði\", \"though I \"eat\"\") from the first principal part (að \"borða\", \"to \"eat\"\"). It is also possible to make the past subjunctive mood (þótt ég \"borðaði\", \"though I \"ate\"\") from the second principal part (ég \"borðaði\", \"I \"ate\"\").\n\nIn some other classes of weak verbs without 'a' as the thematic vowel, the present indicative singular undergoes more changes, but they are still to a large extent predictable.\n\nIcelandic strong verbs have the following principal parts:\nIt is possible to make the present subjunctive mood (þótt ég \"finni\", \"though I \"find\"\") from the first principal part (að \"finna\", \"to \"find\"\"). It is also possible to make the past subjunctive mood (þótt ég \"fyndi\", \"though I \"found\"\") from the third principal part (við \"fundum\", \"we \"found\"\").\n\nThe present singular indicative in this class also undergoes more changes(i-umlaut, dental suffix assimilation etc.), which may let some verbs seem irregular at first glance. They are, however, mainly regular changes, like those in the weak verbs.\n\nIcelandic Preterite-present verbs have the following principal parts:\n\nIt is possible to make the present subjunctive mood (þótt ég \"kunni\", \"though I \"knew\"\") from the first principal part (að \"kunna\", \"to \"know\"\"). It is also possible to make the past subjunctive mood (þótt ég \"kynni\", \"though I \"knew\"\") from the third principal part (ég \"kunni\", \"I \"knew\"\").\n\nIcelandic Ri-verbs have the following principal parts:\n\nIt is possible to make the present subjunctive mood (þótt ég \"snúi\", \"though I \"turn\"\") from the first principal part (að \"snúa\", \"to \"turn\"\"). It is also possible to make the past subjunctive mood (þótt ég \"sneri\", \"though I \"turned\"\") from the second principal part (ég \"sneri\", \"I \"turned\"\").\n\nIn Spanish, verbs are traditionally held to have only one principal part, the infinitive, by which one can classify the verb into one of three conjugation paradigms (according to the ending of the infinitive, which may be \"-ar\", \"-er\" or \"-ir\"). However, some scholars believe that the conjugation could be regularized by adding another principal part to vowel-alternating verbs, which shows the alternation. For example, \"herir\" \"to hurt\" is usually considered irregular because its conjugation contains forms like \"hiero\" \"I hurt\", \"hieres\" \"you hurt\", where the vowel in the root changes into a diphthong. However, by including the first person singular, present tense, indicative mood form (\"hiero\") as a principal part, and noting that the diphthong appears only when that syllable is stressed, the conjugation of \"herir\" becomes completely predictable. \"(See also Spanish verbs, Spanish conjugation.)\"\n\nRegular verbs are formed from a single principal part (the infinitive), and all conjugations derive from this one principal part. A handful of verbs require spelling changes in which case it can be considered that these verbs technically have two or three principal parts depending on how many spelling changes need to me made. They include doubling a consonant, adding accent markers, adding the letter e and converting letters such a y becomes i.\n\nIrregular verbs are markedly more complicating require seven principal parts of which few can be easily derived from the infinitive. For some verbs a few of their principal parts are identical with one another.\n\nThe paradigm goes as follows:\n\nA few highly irregular verbs require 11 principal parts to conjugate them fully. It includes all of the seven principal parts as well as a subjunctive form and different present participle forms, imperative forms and present-participle forms.\n\nThe verbs être, avoir and aller are so irregular they require even more than 11 principal parts.\n\nIn Scottish Gaelic there are two principal parts for the regular verb: the imperative and the verbal noun, for example – 'to kiss'. All finite forms can be deduced from the imperative ('kiss!'), all non-finite forms from the verbal noun ('kissing'). The ten irregular verbs can, with only two or three small aberrations (unexpected lenition), be deduced from four principal parts.\n\nThe principal parts of a Ganda verb are the imperative (identical to the verb stem), the first person singular of the present tense and the modified stem. For example, the verb \"okwogera\" 'to speak' has the principal parts \"yogera–njogera–yogedde\".\n\nThe present tense, far past tense, near future tense, far future tense, subjunctive and infinitive are derived from the imperative. The present perfect, conditional and near past tense are derived from the modified stem.\n\nIn theory the second principal part can be derived from the first, but in practice this is so complicated that it is usually memorised as a separate principal part.\n\n"}

These laws are similar to the Covenant Code and are followed by the phrase \"ten commandments\" ( \"\", in ). Although the phrase \"Ten Commandments\" has traditionally been interpreted as referring to a very different set of laws, in , many scholars believe it instead refers to the Ritual Decalogue found two verses earlier.\n\nCritical biblical scholars understand the two sets of laws to have different authorship.\nEarly scholars, adopting a proposal of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, contrasted the \"Ritual\" Decalogue with the \"Ethical\" Decalogue of and , which are the texts more generally known as the Ten Commandments. Believing that the Bible reflected a shift over time from an emphasis on the ritual to the ethical, they argued that the Ritual Decalogue was composed earlier than the Ethical Decalogue.\nLater scholars have held that they were actually parallel developments, with the Ethical Decalogue a late addition to Exodus copied from Deuteronomy, or that the Ritual Decalogue was the later of the two, a conservative reaction to the secular Ethical Decalogue.\nA few Bible scholars call the verses in Exodus 34 the \"small Covenant code\", as it appears to be a compact version of the Covenant Code in Exodus –; they argue the small Covenant code was composed around the same time as the Decalogue of Exodus 20, but either served different functions within Israelite religion, or reflects the influence of other Ancient Near Eastern religious texts.\n\nThe word \"decalogue\" comes from the Greek name for the Ten Commandments, ('; \"ten terms\"), a translation of the Hebrew (' \"the ten items/terms\").\n\nThe Ritual Decalogue is framed in the context of God making a covenant with Israel:\n\nThis is the only place in the Bible where the phrase \"Ten Commandments\" identifies a set of commandments.\n\nWhile Orthodox Judaism and Christianity hold that both sets contained the same ten commandments, some scholars identify verses 11-26 as an alternate \"ten commandments\" which they call the \"ritual\" decalogue. For these scholars, the terms \"ritual decalogue\" and \"ethical decalogue\" are a way of distinguishing between alternate inscriptions of the ten commandments.\n\nThe commandments in the Ritual Decalogue are expanded upon in the Covenant Code, which occurs prior to it in the Torah, and thus have the impression of being a summary of the important points in the Code. The Covenant Code is believed by most scholars of biblical criticism as having originally been a separate text to the Torah, and thus there is much debate as to the relationship between the Ritual Decalogue and Covenant Code. There are essentially two positions, neither of which is decisively supported, either by evidence, or by number of scholars:\n\n\nThe documentary hypothesis identifies the Ritual Decalogue as the work of the Jahwist, from the Kingdom of Judah, and the Covenant Code as that of the Elohist, from the Kingdom of Israel, both writing independently. It does not however answer the question of how these texts were related, merely that the Ritual Decalogue circulated in Judah, and the Covenant Code in Israel. What the documentary hypothesis does partly explain is the relationship of the Ritual Decalogue to the Ethical Decalogue, and why, instead of the Ethical Decalogue, it is the Ritual Decalogue which is written on the two tablets when Moses ascends the mountain to have the Ethical Decalogue inscribed for a second time.\n\nThe documentary hypothesis claims that the Jahwist and Elohist texts were first combined by a redactor, producing a text referred to simply as JE, in such a way that it now reads that God dictated the Covenant Code, which was written onto stone, Moses subsequently smashing these stones at the incident of the golden calf, and thus having to go back and get a new set, with a set of commandments, the Ritual Decalogue, resembling the first. Under this reconstruction another writer, the Priestly source, later took offence at parts of JE, and rewrote it, dropping the story of the golden calf, and replacing the Ritual Decalogue with a new (ethical) decalogue initially based on it, but taking commandments from elsewhere as well, and replacing the Covenant Code with a vast new law code, placed after the Decalogue for narrative reasons, most of which forms the greater part of the mitzvot in Leviticus.\n\nThe reconstruction then suggests that a century later yet another writer, the Deuteronomist, objected to the Priestly source, and rewrote it yet again, but in a different style: that of a series of flashbacks, producing a second slightly different copy of the Ethical Decalogue, and re-introducing the golden calf. Presented with such divergent versions of the same event, a later redactor is thought to have combined all three versions – JE, the Priestly source, and Deuteronomist, together. JE and the Priestly source were interleaved together, altering JE so that it was now the Ethical Decalogue which was written on the first set of tablets and subsequently destroyed. The alteration, by careful juxtaposition, subtly implied that the second set of tablets also received the Ethical rather than Ritual Decalogue, despite the text saying, immediately after the Ritual Decalogue,\n\nBesides its appearance in , where \"[t]raditionally, it is taken as a reference back to the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20\", the phrase \"\" also appears in , where it is associated with the Ten Commandments of Deuteronomy 5, and in .\n\nSome scholars, calling attention to , \"Then the said: 'I am making a covenant with you',\" note that the laws of Exodus 34 appear to be a shorter and differently organized version of the Covenant Code (). These have been differentiated as the \"Small Covenant Code\" (Exodus 34) and the \"Large Covenant Code\" (Exodus 20–23). These views are not mutually exclusive. Aaron (2006), for example, discusses how the \"Exodus 34 Decalogue\", while presented as the Ten Commandments, appears to be a reworking of the Covenant Code. Indeed, H.L. Ginsberg believed that the Ritual Decalogue was an interpolation, and that the phrase \"Ten Commandments\" in Exodus 34:28 originally referred to a portion of the Covenant Code, , which he called \"the First Ritual Decalogue\".\n\n\n\n"}

The theorem relates the Burnside ring of a finite group \"G\" to the stable cohomotopy of the classifying space \"BG\". The conjecture was made in the mid 1970s by Graeme Segal and proved in 1984 by Gunnar Carlsson. , this statement is still commonly referred to as the Segal conjecture, even though it now has the status of a theorem.\n\nThe Segal conjecture has several different formulations, not all of which are equivalent. Here is a weak form: there exists, for every finite group \"G\", an isomorphism \nHere, lim denotes the inverse limit, π* denotes the stable cohomotopy ring, \"B\" denotes the classifying space, the superscript \"k\" denotes the \"k\"-skeleton, and the subscript + denotes the addition of a disjoint basepoint. On the right-hand side, the hat denotes the completion of the Burnside ring with respect to its augmentation ideal.\n\nThe Burnside ring of a finite group \"G\" is constructed from the category of finite \"G\"-sets as a Grothendieck group. More precisely, let \"M(G)\" be the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of finite \"G\"-sets, with addition the disjoint union of \"G\"-sets and identity element the empty set (which is a \"G\"-set in a unique way). Then \"A(G)\", the Grothendieck group of \"M(G)\", is an abelian group. It is in fact a free abelian group with basis elements represented by the \"G\"-sets \"G\"/\"H\", where \"H\" varies over the subgroups of \"G\". (Note that \"H\" is not assumed here to be a normal subgroup of \"G\", for while \"G\"/\"H\" is not a group in this case, it is still a \"G\"-set.) The ring structure on \"A(G)\" is induced by the direct product of \"G\"-sets; the multiplicative identity is the (isomorphism class of any) one-point set, which becomes a \"G\"-set in a unique way.\n\nThe Burnside ring is the analogue of the representation ring in the category of finite sets, as opposed to the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field (see motivation below). It has proven to be an important tool in the representation theory of finite groups.\n\nFor any topological group \"G\" admitting the structure of a CW-complex, one may consider the category of principal \"G\"-bundles. One can define a functor from the category of CW-complexes to the category of sets by assigning to each CW-complex \"X\" the set of principal \"G\"-bundles on \"X\". This functor descends to a functor on the homotopy category of CW-complexes, and it is natural to ask whether the functor so obtained is representable. The answer is affirmative, and the representing object is called the classifying space of the group \"G\" and typically denoted \"BG\". If we restrict our attention to the homotopy category of CW-complexes, then \"BG\" is unique. Any CW-complex that is homotopy equivalent to \"BG\" is called a \"model\" for \"BG\".\n\nFor example, if \"G\" is the group of order 2, then a model for \"BG\" is infinite-dimensional real projective space. It can be shown that if \"G\" is finite, then any CW-complex modelling \"BG\" has cells of arbitrarily large dimension. On the other hand, if \"G\" = Z, the integers, then the classifying space \"BG\" is homotopy equivalent to the circle \"S\".\n\nThe content of the theorem becomes somewhat clearer if it is placed in its historical context. In the theory of representations of finite groups, one can form an object formula_2 called the representation ring of formula_3 in a way entirely analogous to the construction of the Burnside ring outlined above. The stable cohomotopy is in a sense the natural analog to complex K-theory, which is denoted formula_4. Segal was inspired to make his conjecture after Michael Atiyah proved the existence of an isomorphism\nwhich is a special case of the Atiyah–Segal completion theorem.\n\n"}

Dubbed \"looking glasses\", they were audiovisual links to the aliens in orbit, who were called heptapods for their seven-limbed radially symmetrical appearance. Louise and physicist Dr. Gary Donnelly were recruited by the U.S. Army to communicate with the aliens, and were assigned to one of nine looking glass sites in the US. They made contact with two heptapods they nicknamed Flapper and Raspberry. In an attempt to learn their language, Louise began by associating objects and gestures with sounds the aliens made, which revealed a language with free word order and many levels of center-embedded clauses. She found their writing to be chains of semagrams on a two-dimensional surface in no linear sequence, and semasiographic, having no reference to speech. Louise concluded that, because their speech and writing are unrelated, the heptapods have two languages, which she called Heptapod A (speech) and Heptapod B (writing).\n\nAttempts were also made to establish heptapod terminology in physics. Little progress was made, until a presentation of Fermat's Principle of Least Time was given. Gary explained the principle to Louise, giving the example of the refraction of light, and that light will always take the fastest possible route. Louise reasoned, \"[a] ray of light has to know where it will ultimately end up before it can choose the direction to begin moving in.\" She knew the heptapods did not write a sentence one semagram at a time, but drew all the ideograms simultaneously, suggesting they knew what the entire sentence would be beforehand. Louise realized that instead of experiencing events sequentially (causality), heptapods experience all events at once (teleology). This reflected in their language, and explained why Fermat's principle came naturally to them.\n\nSoon, Louise became quite proficient at Heptapod B, and found that when writing in it, trains of thought were directionless, and premises and conclusions interchangeable. She found herself starting to think in Heptapod B and began to see time as heptapods do. Louise saw glimpses of her future and of a daughter she did not yet have. This raised questions about the nature of free will: knowledge of the future would imply no free will, because knowing the future means it cannot be changed. But Louise asked herself, \"What if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would?\"\n\nOne day, after an information exchange with the heptapods, the aliens announced they were leaving. They shut down the looking glasses and their ships disappeared. It was never established why they left, or why they had come in the first place. The heptapod languages changed Louise's life, and once she knew the future, she never acted contrary to that future. Gary and Louise start spending time together and eventually marry. When Gary asks Louise if she wants a baby, she agrees, knowing that they will divorce, and their daughter will die young.\n\nIn the \"Story Notes\" section of \"Stories of Your Life and Others\", Chiang wrote that inspiration for \"Story of Your Life\" came from his fascination in the variational principle in physics. When he saw American actor Paul Linke's performance in his play \"Time Flies When You’re Alive\", about his wife's struggle with breast cancer, Chiang realized he could use this principle to show how someone deals with the inevitable. Regarding the theme of the story, Chiang said that Kurt Vonnegut summed it up in his introduction in the 25th anniversary edition of his novel \"Slaughterhouse-Five\":\n\nStephen Hawking ... found it tantalizing that we could not remember the future. But remembering the future is child's play for me now. I know what will become of my helpless, trusting babies because they are grown-ups now. I know how my closest friends will end up because so many of them are retired or dead now ... To Stephen Hawking and all others younger than myself I say, \"Be patient. Your future will come to you and lie down at your feet like a dog who knows and likes you no matter what you are.\"\nIn a 2010 interview Chiang said that \"Story of Your Life\" addresses the subject of free will. The philosophical debates about whether or not we have free will are all abstract, but knowing the future makes the question very real. Chiang added, \"If you know what's going to happen, can you keep it from happening? Even when a story says that you can't, the emotional impact arises from the feeling that you should be able to.\"\n\nChiang spent five years researching and familiarizing himself in the field of linguistics before attempting to write \"Story of Your Life.\"\n\nIn \"The New York Review of Books\" American author James Gleick said that \"Story of Your Life\" poses the questions: would knowing your future be a gift or a curse, and is free will simply an illusion? Gleick wrote \"For us ordinary mortals, the day-to-day experience of a preordained future is almost unimaginable\", but Chiang does just that in this story, he \"imagine[s] it\". In a review of Chiang's \"Stories of Your Life and Others\" in \"The Guardian\", English fantasy author China Miéville described \"Story of Your Life\" as \"tender\" with an \"astonishingly moving culmination\", which he said is \"surprising\" considering it is achieved using science.\n\nWriting in \"Kirkus Reviews\" Ana Grilo called it a \"thought-provoking, beautiful story\". He said that in contrast to the familiar fare of lavish stories involving aliens, \"Story of Your Life\" is \"a breath of fresh air\" whose objective \"is to not only to learn how to communicate but how to communicate \"effectively\".\" In a review in \"Emertainment Monthly\" Samantha Schraub said that the story's two narratives, Louise recalling the unraveling of the heptapods' language, and telling her yet-to-be-born daughter what will happen to her, creates \"an ambiguity and air of mystery, which make the reader question everything that unfolds\". Schraub called it \"an award-worthy science fiction novella that will resonate with readers, and leave them thinking how they would live—or even change—their present, if they knew their future.\"\n\n\n"}

Police and reporters in the United States often use the word suspect as a jargon when referring to the perpetrator of the offense (perp in dated US slang). However, in official definition, the perpetrator is the robber, assailant, counterfeiter, etc.—the person who committed the crime. The distinction between suspect and perpetrator recognizes that the suspect is not \"known\" to have committed the offense, while the perpetrator—who may not yet have been suspected of the crime, and is thus not necessarily a suspect—is the one who did. The suspect may be a different person from the perpetrator, or there may have been no actual crime, which would mean there is no perpetrator.\n\nA common error in police reports is a witness description of the suspect (as a witness generally describes a perpetrator, while a mug shot is of suspect). Frequently it is stated that police are looking for the suspect, when there is no suspect; the police \"could\" be looking for a suspect, but they are surely looking for the perpetrator, and very often it is impossible to tell from such a police report whether there is a suspect or not.\n\nPossibly because of the misuse of suspect to mean perpetrator, police in the early 21st century began to use person of interest, possible suspect, and even possible person of interest, to mean suspect.\n\nUnder the judicial systems of the U.S., once a decision is approved to arrest a suspect, or bind him over for trial, either by a prosecutor issuing an information, a grand jury issuing a true bill or indictment, or a judge issuing an arrest warrant, the suspect can then be properly called a defendant, or the accused. Only after being convicted is the suspect properly called the perpetrator.\n\n"}

{"id": "3295111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3295111", "title": "Title search", "text": "Title search\n\nIn real estate business and law, a title search or property title search is the process of retrieving documents evidencing events in the history of a piece of real property, to determine relevant interests in and regulations concerning that property.\n\nIn the case of a prospective purchase, a title search is performed primarily to answer three questions regarding a property on the market:\n\nA title search is also performed when an owner wishes to mortgage property and the bank requires the owner to insure this transaction.\n\nAnyone may do a title search, with the right knowledge and resources. Documents concerning conveyances of land are a matter of public record. These documents are maintained in hard copy paper format or sometimes scanned into image files. The information within the documents is typically not available as data format as the records are descriptions of legal events which contain terms, conditions, and language in excess of data.\n\nGenerally, there are two main types of title searching, a full coverage search and limited coverage search; other types include non-insured reports and foreclosure guarantee search.\n\nIt is often the case that people choose to contact a title company or attorney to conduct an exhaustive title search. The process of performing a title search involves accessing the official land records for the subject property. Each record is a document evidencing an event which occurred in the history of the property. A deed records an event of property transfer, a mortgage documents the collateral interest of a home loan, and a lien documents a claim against the property in favor of another, such as a creditor, vendor, or tradesman. The objective of the title search is to establish clear, marketable title by exposing any outstanding claims prior to transfer of title.\n\nEach recorded document must name the parties involved, e.g., grantor and grantee. The grantor is the party transferring away a property right, and the grantee is receiving a property right. In the case of a deed the grantor would typically be the property seller, and the grantee the buyer. A mortgage grantor or mortgagor is the borrower of the loan, since they are giving away certain property rights to the mortgagee, lender, or mortgage grantee. More recent wording simplifies this language with \"Borrower\" and \"Lender.\"\n\nThe records are kept in a centralized government office, usually at the county courthouse (in states with strong county governments such as Washington State or Massachusetts, the title on the door would be something like Registrar of Deeds or County Recorder); or in the municipal offices (in small states such as Connecticut, Vermont, and Rhode Island), often the title searcher must go to each individual town or county office to research the title.\n\nThe process of a title search begins with searching for and retrieving each physical document from the books which contain them. Every document is recorded by date in a special set of volumes called by various names such as Grantor-Grantee index, Land Records or Deed Records), which may or may not be digitized or scanned into a searchable file, depending on the financial resources of the county or town. An official stamp located usually at the bottom of the first page gives the name of the recording official, date, time, book and page number. If the document has been recorded, this stamp will ALWAYS be there.\n\nThe collected documents are then reviewed and analyzed to see how each affects the property, and which documents have been released by subsequent recordings. Contingent conditions within documents such as life estates and remainder interests may exist within the document language. This process is often performed by a trained professional called a title abstractor. Some title abstractors have certifications documenting their experience level and training and successfully having passed an exam.\n\nThe document produced by a title abstractor is called a title abstract, or abstract of title. This is not a document which exists in public records, but it is derived from recorded documents. The title abstract is provided to the title company, attorney, or end-user by the abstractor.\n\nFor example, a title report may also show any easements, or recorded encumbrances against the property or portions of the property. A previous owner may have legally given a neighbor the right to share the driveway, or the city may have a right to strips of the property for putting power lines, communication lines, water pipes, or sewer pipes. A few on-line services offer title searches for relatively little cost, and their accuracy is not inferior to what a title company or attorney will offer; however on-line businesses rely mostly on electronically available information, and for that reason could at times be limited both in completeness and geographical availability.\n\nA full coverage search is usually done when creating a title report for sale/resale transactions and for transaction that involves construction loans. It generally includes searches related to property lien, easements, covenants, conditions and restrictions(CC&Rs), agreements, resolutions and ordinances that will affect the real property in question.\n\nA limited coverage search is usually making title reports for refinance transactions that involves ownership equity loans and for making simple title guarantee reports.\n\nThis kind of title searching usually includes searches for property liens, liens against the owner and the other parties on title and search for bankruptcy proceedings against the owner of the property.\n\nIn the United States, the buyer of a property will usually purchase title insurance, which protects the buyer from any title problems that may arise after sale, such as liens that were missed during the title search. The title insurance company issues a report and an insurance policy in support of its findings. However, title searches are most often carried out before contracting is completed between parties, and sometimes during the escrow phase of a closing.\n\nThere are a variety of title searches which provide the customer with a report, but no insurance. These are for informational purposes only, and are called by a variety of names, such as Lot Book Report, Plat Certificate, 300-foot Radius Report, and others. These informational searches are used mainly in two instances:\n\nA foreclosure guarantee is a type of report (e.g. trustees sale guarantee, judicial foreclosure guarantee and litigation guarantee) that is used mainly for foreclosing an encumbrances (or a lien) in a certain property. The title searcher will perform a full coverage search to the property in default and a search for the addresses of the lien holders to the property in default. The addresses will be used for sending copies of the notice of foreclosure letters (such as notice of trustees sale, etc.) to the lien holders to the property in default.\n\nA home foreclosure is often linked with liens held by banks or governmental agencies. Multiple liens from various sources may be held against a property in foreclosure. If a home is sold at a foreclosure auction, the proceeds are divided and paid to lienholders in order of filing until all proceeds are expended.\n\nPublic auctions (also known as sheriff’s sales or foreclosure auctions) are typically held in the municipal or county courts, which neither guarantee an unencumbered title nor offer protection to buyers against additional liens on the property.\n\n"}
