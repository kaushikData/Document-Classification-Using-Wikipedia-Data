As far as can be determined from the small corpus, it was extremely similar to Biblical Hebrew, with some possible Aramaic influence including the use of the verb \"‘bd\" (עבד) instead of the more common Biblical Hebrew \"‘śh\" (עשה) for \"make\". The only other notable difference with Biblical Hebrew is the sporadic retention of feminine singular \"-t\" (\"’šħt\" \"cistern\" but \"‘lyh\" \"high (fem.)\".)\n\nIt was first described as a separate language in 1970 by Italian Orientalist . Subsequently, a number of inscriptions previously identified as Hebrew, Phoenician, or Aramaic were reclassified, as a result of consensus around the similarity of the Amman Theatre Inscription, Amman Citadel Inscription, Tell Siren Bottle, Heshbon Ostraca, and Tell el-Mazer Ostraca.\n\nAccording to \"Glottolog\", referencing Huehnergard & Rubin (2011), Ammonite was not a distinct language from Hebrew.\n\n"}

{"id": "2778969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2778969", "title": "CCSID", "text": "CCSID\n\nCCSID is an abbreviation used by IBM to mean \"Coded Character Set Identifier\". It is a 16-bit number that represents a specific encoding of a specific code page. For example, Unicode is a code page that has several encoding forms, like UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.\n\nThe terms code page and CCSID are often used interchangeably, even though they are not synonymous. A code page may be only part of what makes up a CCSID. The following definitions, from IBM, help to illustrate this point, from glyph to CCSID and everything in between. \n\nA glyph is the actual physical pattern of pixels or ink that shows up on a display or printout. \n\nA character is a concept that covers all glyphs associated with a certain symbol. For instance, \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"F\", and \"F\" are all different glyphs, but use the same character. The various modifiers (bold, italic, underline, color, and font) do not change the F's essential F-ness. \n\nA character set contains the characters necessary to allow a particular human to carry on a meaningful interaction with the computer. It does not specify how those characters are represented in a computer. This level is the first one to separate characters into various alphabets (Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic, and so on) or ideographic groups (Chinese, Korean, and so on). It corresponds to a \"character repertoire\" in the Unicode encoding model.\n\nA code page represents a particular assignment of code point values to characters. It corresponds to a \"coded character set\" in the Unicode encoding model. A code point for a character is the computer's internal representation of that character in a given code page. Many characters are represented by different code points in different code pages. Certain character sets can be adequately represented with single-byte code pages (which have a maximum 256 code points, hence a maximum of 256 characters), but many require more than that. Examples include JIS X 0208 and Unicode.\n\nAn encoding scheme is the byte format of a code page. It maps code point values to sequences of one or more byte values in a computer. For example, UTF-8 and UTF-16BE are two encodings of the same Unicode code page. In IBM's CDRA, this is typically represented with an ESID (Encoding Scheme IDentifier). EUC and ISO-2022 are other examples of encoding schemes. \n\nA coded character set identifier (CCSID) contains all of the information necessary to assign and preserve the meaning and rendering of characters through various stages of processing and interchange. This information always includes at least one code page, but may include multiple code pages of differing byte-lengths. The CCSID also has an associated encoding scheme that governs how various code points are to be handled. This mechanism allows a program to recognize bidirectional orientation, character shaping (mainly of Arabic characters), and other complex encoding information.\n\nThe following examples show how some CCSIDs are made up of other CCSIDs.\n\nAll three of these variant Shift-JIS CCSIDs are MBCS (multi-byte character sets). The SBCS (single byte character set) portion of each CCSID is different. The DBCS portion is the same across each CCSID. CCSID 5028 uses an updated code page 897 called CCSID 4993. CCSID 932 uses the original code page 897, which is CCSID 897. CCSID 942 uses a different SBCS from the other 2 CCSIDs, which is 1041.\n\nAlso notice how CCSID 5028 and 4993 are different by 4096 (1000 in hexadecimal) from the predecessor CCSID with the same code page identifier. This is a common way that CDRA denotes an upgraded CCSID.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this complexity:\n\n"}

Prospective students, their family members and other visitors take campus tours to learn about the college or university's facilities, as well as student life, culture on campus, academics, and programs offered by the institution. During these tours, prospective students are able to learn about the built environment and the overall look and feel of the institution. \n\nCampus tours are usually free, as they promote the institution and encourage prospective students to attend the school. Often, schools may give visitors T-shirts or other gifts for taking a tour. \n\nThese tours are normally walking tours for groups of 10 to 30 visitors, led by a tour guide. Campus tours are often preceded by an information session, presented by a member of the admissions staff. Many campus tours include a visit to a residence hall room and a classroom or lecture hall. At most schools, tours are led by students, although admissions office staff or other representatives of the school may also be tour guides. Most universities offer accommodations for students with disabilities, such as alternatives to walking for someone who cannot walk easily.\n\nFor prospective students, the tour may be part of a larger campus visitation program. Some schools provide overnight accommodation and meals, and students may sit-in on a class during their visit. Some programs pair a prospective student with a current student and allow the prospective student to shadow the current student for a day.\n\nLike similar sales techniques that rely on the unconscious saliency bias, a pleasant campus tour – perhaps taken in good weather and with a gift presented at the end – is effective at making students want to enroll, and an unpleasant experience – such as a chance encounter with a grumpy staff member – can have the opposite effect. \n\nThe tours tend to emphasize peripheral things, such as the quality of the physical plant, and do not give students a full and accurate idea of either what the school's educational qualities are or what it would be like to live in that community, rather than merely visiting it.\n\nAs a result, a tour can cause a student to make choices that are not aligned with their long-term educational goals.\n\n"}

{"id": "15559907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15559907", "title": "Composite film", "text": "Composite film\n\nA composite film is a feature film whose screenplay is composed of two or more distinct stories. More generally, composite structure refers to an aesthetic principle in which the narrative structure relies on contiguity and linking rather than linearity. In a composite text or film, individual pieces are complete within themselves, yet they form a whole work that is greater than the sum of its individual parts.\n\nThe history of composite films begins with composite novels. The composite novel is a literary work composed of shorter texts that—though individually complete and autonomous—are interrelated in a coherent whole according to one or more organizing principles.\n\nAlthough the composite-text aesthetic can be traced back through framework-stories (such as the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" and \"The Canterbury Tales\"), story cycles (such as the Arthurian stories), and sacred composites (such as the Bible), composite texts had specific precursors in the village sketch of nineteenth century Europe and America. Reflecting its roots in the framework-story and/or the cycle, a typical village sketch may feature an introductory story and a summary story, with individually titled internal stories that do not necessarily depend upon specific sequencing.\n\nTwentieth century experimentation with the composite whole-text aesthetic, i.e., combining individual short stories into a whole-text narrative, began with James Joyce's \"Dubliners\" and Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio and accelerated thereafter, but the composite novel remained controversial among readers, reviewers, and critics. Some wanted to call these works \"novels\" while others wanted to call them \"collections\". To their authors, however, these works were clearly not just collections of stories. Joyce insisted that \"Dubliners\" was a planned, integrated whole text. William Faulkner fought both publishers and critics over the whole-text coherence of \"Go Down, Moses\", refusing to append \"And Other Stories\" to the book's title. Later, Maxine Hong Kingston and Tim O'Brien would wage similar battles over \"The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Childhood Among Ghosts\" (1976) and \"The Things They Carried\" (1990), respectively. By the end of the twentieth century, authors were announcing their whole-text intentions by insisting on such sub-titles as \"A Novel in Stories\", or simply \"A Novel\".\n\nComposite novels have been referred to as a number of other genre-names including short story cycle, framed miscellany, multi-faceted novel, story-novel, short story blend, double-novel, short story compound, short story composite, composite, anthology novel, para novel, triptych, mosaic novel, loose-leaf novel, and short story sequence.\n\nWithin a composite film, the individual stories may or may not be titled. Most highly integrated composite films, such as \"Love Actually\", \"Traffic\" etc., do not have individually titled components while more traditional composite films, such as \"Paris, je t'aime\", \"Coffee & Cigarettes\", \"Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her\", \"Pulp Fiction\" etc., do. Titling each component reinforces its autonomy and helps viewers experience it both individually and as part of the whole film.\n\nMany different devices are used to connect the individual stories to each other and to the film in its entirety. Unifying elements include repeated images (such as coffee cups and ash trays in \"Coffee & Cigarettes\"), recurring characters (the women within \"Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her\" appear in at least one story other than their own), shared incidents (drug addiction in \"Requiem for a Dream\"), common settings (the dark streets of \"Sin City\"), similar themes (the three women of \"The Hours\"), a single protagonist (Tommy in \"The Fountain\"), collective protagonists (a group of people like generations of a family, coworkers, a club etc.), etc.\n\nThe sequence in which the individual stories unfold is often significant to the overall meaning of the film. Component pieces can be arranged in a number of different ways (chronologically, thematically, geographically etc.) and each method produces different results.\n\nIn regards to issues with connectivity, it is important to consider the musical score of composite films. Much like visual repetition or thematic similarities, the score offers another medium through which stories can be linked. Rather than leaving viewers with content to process, decode, intellectualize and then react to, the film score can produce emotional reactions immediately, before viewers have a chance to analyze their own responses. There are three main categories of composite film scores:\n\nIn a unified score, there is no discernible difference between the music playing during each story segment. For example, in \"Sin City\", the highly stylized background music offers ambiance and contributes to the setting and does not vary between characters and stories. In \"Love Actually\", pop music blares through happy moments, ballads wail during morose moments, and triumphant strings swell when all things are as they should be.\nIn a composite score, the music within each individual segment is independent and distinct from the music within other segments. For example, in \"Paris, je t'aime\", each titled piece is accompanied by music that relates only to that single piece rather than the film as a whole. In this example, rather than linking the story lines, the music serves to further distinguish each neighborhood from the others.\n\nTheme and variation refers to a main theme that varies slightly by story segment. For example, in \"The Fountain\", one main theme appears in each character's story, but there are also variations on that theme specific to those individual characters (tribal drums accompany the conquistador in Mayan territory, etc.). In \"Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her\", the main theme throughout the film consists of somber classical guitar and accompanying piano, but within each individually titled segment, there are minor differences. Sultry horns are added to the banker's scenes, as she is having an affair, and as the detective investigates the death of her Hispanic friend, the music takes on a subtle Latin sound, etc.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The use of corporate jargon is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult.\n\nThe tone is associated with managers of large corporations, business management consultants, and occasionally government. Reference to such jargon is typically derogatory, implying the use of long, complicated, or obscure words, abbreviations, euphemisms, and acronyms. For that reason some of its forms may be considered as an argot. Some of these words may be actually new inventions, designed purely to fit the specialized meaning of a situation or even to \"spin\" negative situations as positive situations.\n\nMarketing speak is a related label for wording styles used to promote a product or service to a wide audience by seeking to create the impression that the vendors of the service possess a high level of sophistication, skill, and technical knowledge. Such language is often used in marketing press releases, advertising copy, and prepared statements read by executives and politicians.\n\nMany terms have straightforward meanings in other contexts (e.g., leverage in physics, picked up with a well-defined meaning in finance), but are used more loosely in business speak. For example, \"deliverable\" is used to refer to anything that has to be done by a certain date to be verified by another party.\n\nThe phrases \"going forward\" or \"moving forward\" make a confident gesture towards the future, but are generally vague on timing, which usually means it can be removed from a sentence with little or no effect on its overall meaning.\n\nLegal terms such as \"Chapter 11\" can be used without explaining what they are about: for example, Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code is about US bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "394272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=394272", "title": "David Lewis (philosopher)", "text": "David Lewis (philosopher)\n\nDavid Kellogg Lewis (September 28, 1941 – October 14, 2001) was an American philosopher. Lewis taught briefly at UCLA and then at Princeton from 1970 until his death. He is also closely associated with Australia, whose philosophical community he visited almost annually for more than thirty years. He made contributions in philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, philosophy of probability, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophical logic, and aesthetics. He is probably best known for his controversial modal realist stance: that (i) possible worlds exist, (ii) every possible world is a concrete entity, (iii) any possible world is causally and spatiotemporally isolated from any other possible world, and (iv) our world is among the possible worlds.\n\nLewis was born in Oberlin, Ohio, to John D. Lewis, a Professor of Government at Oberlin College, and Ruth Ewart Kelloggs Lewis, a distinguished medieval historian. The formidable intellect for which he was known later in his life was already manifest during his years at Oberlin High School, when he attended college lectures in chemistry. He went on to Swarthmore College and spent a year at Oxford University (1959–1960), where he was tutored by Iris Murdoch and attended lectures by Gilbert Ryle, H.P. Grice, P.F. Strawson, and J.L. Austin. It was his year at Oxford that played a seminal role in his decision to study philosophy, and which made him the quintessentially analytic philosopher that he would soon become. Lewis went on to receive his Ph.D from Harvard in 1967, where he studied under W.V.O. Quine, many of whose views he came to repudiate. It was there that his connection with Australia was first established when he took a seminar with J.J.C. Smart, a leading Australian philosopher. \"I taught David Lewis,\" Smart would say in later years, \"Or rather, he taught me.\"\n\nLewis's first monograph was \"Convention: A Philosophical Study\" (1969), which is based on his doctoral dissertation and uses concepts of game theory to analyze the nature of social conventions; it won the American Philosophical Association's first Franklin Matchette Prize for the best book published in philosophy by a philosopher under 40 years old. Lewis claimed that social conventions, such as the convention in most states that one drives on the right (not on the left), the convention that the original caller will re-call if a phone conversation is interrupted, etc., are solutions to so-called \"'co-ordination problems'\". Co-ordination problems were at the time of Lewis's book an under-discussed kind of game-theoretical problem; most of the game-theoretical discussion had circulated around problems where the participants are in conflict, such as the prisoner's dilemma.\n\nCo-ordination problems are problematic, for, though the participants have common interests, there are several solutions. Sometimes, one of the solutions may be \"'salient'\", a concept invented by the game-theorist and economist Thomas Schelling (by whom Lewis was much inspired). For example, a co-ordination problem that has the form of a meeting may have a salient solution if there is only one possible spot to meet in town. But in most cases, we must rely on what Lewis calls \"precedent\" in order to get a salient solution. If both participants know that a particular co-ordination problem, say \"which side should we drive on?\" has been solved in the same way numerous times before, both know that both know this, both know that both know that both know this, etc. (this particular state Lewis calls common knowledge, and it has since been much discussed by philosophers and game theorists), then they will easily solve the problem. That they have solved the problem successfully will be seen by even more people, and thus the convention will spread in the society. A convention is thus a behavioural regularity that sustains itself because it serves the interests of everyone involved. Another important feature of a convention is that a convention could be entirely different: one could just as well drive on the left; it is more or less arbitrary that one drives on the right in the USA, for example.\n\nLewis's main goal in the book, however, wasn't simply to provide an account of convention but rather to investigate the \"platitude that language is ruled by convention\" (Convention, p. 1.) The last two chapters of the book (Signalling Systems and Conventions of Language; cf. also \"Languages and Language\", 1975) make the case that the use of a language in a population consists of conventions of truthfulness and trust among members of the population. Lewis recasts in this framework notions as those of truth and analyticity, claiming that they are better understood as relations between sentences and a language, rather than as properties of sentences.\n\nLewis went on to publish Counterfactuals (1973), which contained an analysis of counterfactual conditionals in terms of the theory of possible worlds. According to Lewis, what makes a statement of the form\n\"Had I made that shot our team would have won the game.\"\ntrue is that in any world where I make the shot but the world is otherwise as similar as possible to the actual one, our team wins the game. If there is a world maximally similar to ours where I make the shot but our team still loses, the counterfactual is false. This treatment of counterfactuals is a variation or generalization of the one published by Robert Stalnaker a few years earlier, and consequently this kind of treatment is called the Stalnaker-Lewis theory.\n\nWhat made Lewis's views about counterfactuals controversial is that whereas Stalnaker treated possible worlds as imaginary entities, \"made up\" for the sake of theoretical convenience, Lewis adopted a position his formal account of counterfactuals did not commit him to, namely modal realism. According to this view as Lewis formulated it, when we speak of a world where I made the shot that in this world I missed, we are speaking of a world just as real as this one, and although we say that in that world I made the shot, more precisely it is not I but a \"counterpart\" of mine that was successful.\n\nHe had already proposed this view in some of his earlier papers: \"Counterpart Theory and Quantified Modal Logic\" (1968), \"Anselm and Actuality\" (1970), and \"Counterparts of Persons and their Bodies\" (1971). The theory was widely considered implausible, but Lewis urged that it should be taken seriously. Most often the idea that there exists an infinite number of causally isolated universes, each as real as our own but different from it in some way, and that furthermore that alluding to objects in this universe as necessary in order to explain what makes certain counterfactual statements true but not others, meets with what Lewis calls the \"incredulous stare\" (Lewis, OPW, 2005, pg. 135-137). Lewis defends and elaborates his theory of extreme modal realism, while insisting that there is nothing extreme about it, in On the Plurality of Worlds (1986). Lewis acknowledges that his theory is contrary to common sense, but believes that its advantages far outweigh this disadvantage, and that therefore we should not be hesitant to pay this price.\n\nAccording to Lewis, \"actual\" is merely an indexical label we give to a world when we locate ourselves in it. Things are necessarily true when they are true in all possible worlds. (Note that Lewis is not the first one to speak of possible worlds in this context. Leibniz and C.I. Lewis, for example, both speak of possible worlds as a way of thinking about possibility and necessity, and some of David Kaplan's early work is on the counterpart theory. Lewis's original suggestion was that all possible worlds are equally concrete, and the world in which we find ourselves is no more real than any other possible world.)\n\nThis theory has faced a number of criticisms. In particular, it is not clear how we could know what goes on in other worlds. After all, they are causally disconnected from ours; we can't look into them to see what is going on there. A related objection is that, while people are concerned with what they could have done, they are not concerned with what some people in other worlds, no matter how similar to them, do. As Saul Kripke once put it, a presidential candidate could not care less whether someone else, in another world, wins an election, but does care whether he himself could have won it (Kripke 1980, p. 45). A more basic criticism is that introducing so many entities into our ontology violates the maxim of Occam's razor, which tells us not to multiply theoretical entities beyond what is necessary to explain the facts our theories aim to explain.\n\nPossible worlds are employed in the work of Saul Kripke and many others, but not in the concrete sense propounded by Lewis. While none of these alternative approaches has found anything near universal acceptance, very few philosophers accept Lewis's particular brand of modal realism.\n\nAt Princeton, Lewis was a mentor of young philosophers, and trained dozens of successful figures in the field, including several current Princeton faculty members, as well as people now teaching at a number of the leading philosophy departments in the U.S. Among his most prominent students are Bob Brandom at the University of Pittsburgh, L.A. Paul at the University of North Carolina, Cian Dorr and David Velleman at NYU, Peter Railton at Michigan, and Joshua Greene at Harvard. His direct and indirect influence is evident in the work of many prominent philosophers of the current generation.\n\nLewis suffered from severe diabetes for much of his life, which eventually grew worse and led to kidney failure. In July 2000 he received a kidney transplant from his wife Stephanie. The transplant allowed him to work and travel for another year, before he died suddenly and unexpectedly from further complications of his diabetes, on October 14, 2001.\n\nSince his death a number of posthumous papers have been published, on topics ranging from truth and causation to philosophy of physics. \"Lewisian Themes\", a collection of papers on his philosophy, was published in 2004.\n\n\nLewis published five volumes containing 99 papers — almost all of the papers he published during his lifetime. These papers discuss his counterfactual theory of causation, the concept of semantic score, a contextualist analysis of knowledge, a dispositional value theory, among many other topics.\n\nLewis's monograph, \"Parts of Classes\" (1991), on the foundations of mathematics, sketched a reduction of set theory and Peano arithmetic to mereology and plural quantification. Very soon after its publication, Lewis became dissatisfied with some aspects of its argument; it is currently out of print (his paper \"Mathematics is megethology,\" in \"Papers in Philosophical Logic,\" is partly a summary and partly a revision of \"Parts of Classes\").\n\n\n\n"}

This is in contrast to analog video, which represents moving visual images with analog signals. Digital video comprises a series of digital images displayed in rapid succession.\n\nDigital video was first introduced commercially in 1986 with the Sony D1 format, which recorded an uncompressed standard definition component video signal in digital form. In addition to uncompressed formats, popular compressed digital video formats today include H.264 and MPEG-4. Modern interconnect standards for digital video include HDMI, DisplayPort, Digital Visual Interface (DVI) and serial digital interface (SDI).\n\nDigital video can be copied with no degradation in quality. In contrast, when analog sources are copied, they experience generation loss. Digital video can be stored on digital media such as Blu-ray Disc, on computer data storage or streamed over the Internet to end users who watch content on a desktop computer screen or a digital smart TV. In everyday practice, digital video content such as TV shows and movies also includes a digital audio soundtrack.\n\nStarting in the late 1970s to the early 1980s, several types of video production equipment that were digital in their internal workings were introduced. These included time base correctors (TBC) and digital video effects (DVE) units. They operated by taking a standard analog composite video input and digitizing it internally. This made it easier to either correct or enhance the video signal, as in the case of a TBC, or to manipulate and add effects to the video, in the case of a DVE unit. The digitized and processed video information was then converted back to standard analog video for output.\n\nLater on in the 1970s, manufacturers of professional video broadcast equipment, such as Bosch (through their Fernseh division) and Ampex developed prototype digital videotape recorders (VTR) in their research and development labs. Bosch's machine used a modified 1 inch type B videotape transport, and recorded an early form of CCIR 601 digital video. Ampex's prototype digital video recorder used a modified 2 inch Quadruplex videotape VTR (an Ampex AVR-3), but fitted with custom digital video electronics, and a special \"octaplex\" 8-head headwheel (regular analog 2\" Quad machines only used 4 heads). Like standard 2\" Quad, the audio on the Ampex prototype digital machine, nicknamed by its developers as \"Annie\", still recorded the audio in analog as linear tracks on the tape. None of these machines from these manufacturers were ever marketed commercially.\n\nDigital video was first introduced commercially in 1986 with the Sony D1 format, which recorded an uncompressed standard definition component video signal in digital form. Component video connections required 3 cables and most television facilities were wired for composite NTSC or PAL video using one cable. Due this incompatibility and also due to the cost of the recorder, D1 was used primarily by large television networks and other component-video capable video studios.\n\nIn 1988, Sony and Ampex co-developed and released the D2 digital videocassette format, which recorded video digitally without compression in ITU-601 format, much like D1. But D2 had the major difference of encoding the video in composite form to the NTSC standard, thereby only requiring single-cable composite video connections to and from a D2 VCR, making it a perfect fit for the majority of television facilities at the time. D2 was a successful format in the television broadcast industry throughout the late '80s and the '90s. D2 was also widely used in that era as the master tape format for mastering laserdiscs.\n\nD1 & D2 would eventually be replaced by cheaper systems using video compression, most notably Sony's Digital Betacam that were introduced into the network's television studios. Other examples of digital video formats utilizing compression were Ampex's DCT (the first to employ such when introduced in 1992), the industry-standard DV and MiniDV and its professional variations, Sony's DVCAM and Panasonic's DVCPRO, and Betacam SX, a lower-cost variant of Digital Betacam using MPEG-2 compression.\n\nOne of the first digital video products to run on personal computers was \"PACo: The PICS Animation Compiler\" from The Company of Science & Art in Providence, RI, which was developed starting in 1990 and first shipped in May 1991. PACo could stream unlimited-length video with synchronized sound from a single file (with the \".CAV\" file extension) on CD-ROM. Creation required a Mac; playback was possible on Macs, PCs, and Sun SPARCstations.\n\nQuickTime, Apple Computer's multimedia framework appeared in June 1991. Audio Video Interleave from Microsoft followed in 1992. Initial consumer-level content creation tools were crude, requiring an analog video source to be digitized to a computer-readable format. While low-quality at first, consumer digital video increased rapidly in quality, first with the introduction of playback standards such as MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 (adopted for use in television transmission and DVD media), and then the introduction of the DV tape format allowing recordings in the format to be transferred direct to digital video files using a FireWire port on an editing computer. This simplified the process, allowing non-linear editing systems (NLE) to be deployed cheaply and widely on desktop computers with no external playback or recording equipment needed.\n\nThe widespread adoption of digital video and accompanying compression formats has reduced the bandwidth needed for a high-definition video signal (with HDV and AVCHD, as well as several commercial variants such as DVCPRO-HD, all using less bandwidth than a standard definition analog signal). These savings have increased the number of channels available on cable television and direct broadcast satellite systems, created opportunities for spectrum reallocation of terrestrial television broadcast frequencies, made tapeless camcorders based on flash memory possible among other innovations and efficiencies.\n\nDigital video comprises a series of orthogonal bitmap digital images displayed in rapid succession at a constant rate. In the context of video these images are called frames. The rate at which frames are displayed in is measured in frames per second (FPS). Since every frame is an orthogonal bitmap digital image it comprises a raster of pixels. If it has a width of W pixels and a height of H pixels it is said that the frame size is W\"x\"H. Pixels have only one property, their color. The color of a pixel is represented by a fixed number of bits. The more bits the more subtle variations of colors can be reproduced. This is called the color depth (CD) of the video.\n\nAn example video can have a duration (T) of 1 hour (3600\"sec\"), a frame size of 640x480 \"(WxH)\" at a color depth of 24 \"bits\" and a frame rate of 25\"fps\". This example video has the following properties:\n\nThe most important properties are \"bit rate\" and \"video size\". The formulas relating those two with all other properties are:\n\nwhile some secondary formulas are:\n\nIn interlaced video each \"frame\" is composed of two \"halves of an image\". The first half contains only the odd-numbered lines of a full frame. The second half contains only the even-numbered lines. Those halves are referred to individually as \"fields\". Two consecutive fields compose a full frame. If an interlaced video has a frame rate of 15 frames per second the field rate is 30 fields per second. All the properties and formulas discussed here apply equally to interlaced video but one should be careful not to confuse the fields per second rate with the frames per second rate.\n\nThe above are accurate for uncompressed video. Because of the relatively high bit rate of uncompressed video, video compression is extensively used. In the case of compressed video each frame requires a small percentage of the original bits. Assuming a compression algorithm that shrinks the input data by a factor of CF, the bit rate and video size would equal to:\n\nNote that it is not necessary that all frames are equally compressed by a factor of CF. In practice they are not, so CF is the \"average\" factor of compression for \"all\" the frames taken together.\n\nThe above equation for the bit rate can be rewritten by combining the compression factor and the color depth like this:\n\nThe value (CD / CF) represents the average bits per pixel (BPP). As an example, if there is a color depth of 12 bits/pixel and an algorithm that compresses at 40x, then BPP equals 0.3 (12/40). So in the case of compressed video the formula for bit rate is:\n\nThe same formula is valid for uncompressed video because in that case one can assume that the \"compression\" factor is 1 and that the average bits per pixel equal the color depth.\n\nBy its definition, bit rate is a measure of the rate of information content of the digital video stream. In the case of uncompressed video, bit rate corresponds directly to the quality of the video. (Bit rate is proportional to every property that affects the video quality.) Bit rate is an important property when transmitting video because the transmission link must be capable of supporting that bit rate. Bit rate is also important when dealing with the storage of video because, as shown above, the video size is proportional to the bit rate and the duration. Bit rate of uncompressed video is too high for most practical applications. Video compression is used to greatly reduce the bit rate. BPP is a measure of the efficiency of compression. A true-color video with no compression at all may have a BPP of 24 bits/pixel. Chroma subsampling can reduce the BPP to 16 or 12 bits/pixel. Applying jpeg compression on every frame can reduce the BPP to 8 or even 1 bits/pixel. Applying video compression algorithms like MPEG1, MPEG2 or MPEG4 allows for fractional BPP values.\n\nAs noted above, BPP represents the \"average\" bits per pixel. There are compression algorithms that keep the BPP almost constant throughout the entire duration of the video. In this case, we also get video output with a constant bit rate (CBR). This CBR video is suitable for real-time, non-buffered, fixed bandwidth video streaming (e.g. in videoconferencing). As not all frames can be compressed at the same level, because quality is more severely impacted for scenes of high complexity, some algorithms try to constantly adjust the BPP. They keep it high while compressing complex scenes and low for less demanding scenes. This way, one gets the best quality at the smallest average bit rate (and the smallest file size, accordingly). When using this method, the bit rate is variable because it tracks the variations of the BPP.\n\nStandard film stocks such as 16 mm and 35 mm record at 24 frames per second. For video, there are two frame rate standards: NTSC, which shoot at 30/1.001 (about 29.97) frames per second or 59.94 fields per second, and PAL, 25 frames per second or 50 fields per second. Digital video cameras come in two different image capture formats: interlaced and deinterlaced / progressive scan. Interlaced cameras record the image in alternating sets of lines: the odd-numbered lines are scanned, and then the even-numbered lines are scanned, then the odd-numbered lines are scanned again, and so on. One set of odd or even lines is referred to as a \"field\", and a consecutive pairing of two fields of opposite parity is called a \"frame\". Deinterlaced cameras records each frame as distinct, with all scan lines being captured at the same moment in time. Thus, interlaced video captures samples the scene motion twice as often as progressive video does, for the same number of frames per second. Progressive-scan camcorders generally produce a slightly sharper image. However, motion may not be as smooth as interlaced video which uses 50 or 59.94 fields per second, particularly if they employ the 24 frames per second standard of film.\n\nDigital video can be copied with no degradation in quality. No matter how many generations of a digital source is copied, it will still be as clear as the original first generation of digital footage. However a change in parameters like frame size as well as a change of the digital format can decrease the quality of the video due to new calculations that have to be made. Digital video can be manipulated and edited to follow an order or sequence on an NLE, or non-linear editing workstation, a computer-based device intended to edit video and audio. More and more, videos are edited on readily available, increasingly affordable consumer-grade computer hardware and software. However, such editing systems require ample disk space for video footage. The many video formats and parameters to be set make it quite impossible to come up with a specific number for how many minutes need how much time.\n\nDigital video has a significantly lower cost than 35 mm film. In comparison to the high cost of film stock, the tape stock (or other electronic media used for digital video recording, such as flash memory or hard disk drive) used for recording digital video is very inexpensive. Digital video also allows footage to be viewed on location without the expensive chemical processing required by film. Also physical deliveries of tapes and broadcasts do not apply anymore. Digital television (including higher quality HDTV) started to spread in most developed countries in early 2000s. Digital video is also used in modern mobile phones and video conferencing systems. Digital video is also used for Internet distribution of media, including streaming video and peer-to-peer movie distribution. However even within Europe are lots of TV-Stations not broadcasting in HD, due to restricted budgets for new equipment for processing HD.\n\nMany types of video compression exist for serving digital video over the internet and on optical disks. The file sizes of digital video used for professional editing are generally not practical for these purposes, and the video requires further compression with codecs such as Sorenson, H.264 and more recently Apple ProRes especially for HD. Probably the most widely used formats for delivering video over the internet are MPEG4, Quicktime, Flash and Windows Media, while MPEG2 is used almost exclusively for DVDs, providing an exceptional image in minimal size but resulting in a high level of CPU consumption to decompress.\n\n, the highest resolution demonstrated for digital video generation is 35 megapixels (8192 x 4320). The highest speed is attained in industrial and scientific high speed cameras that are capable of filming 1024x1024 video at up to 1 million frames per second for brief periods of recording.\n\nMany interfaces have been designed specifically to handle the requirements of uncompressed digital video (from roughly 400 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s):\n\n\nThe following interface has been designed for carrying MPEG-Transport compressed video:\nCompressed video is also carried using UDP-IP over Ethernet. Two approaches exist for this:\n\nAlternative methods of carrying video over IP include:\n\nAll current formats, which are listed below, are PCM based.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "322376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=322376", "title": "Ecological succession", "text": "Ecological succession\n\nEcological succession is the process of change in the species structure of an ecological community over time. The time scale can be decades (for example, after a wildfire), or even millions of years after a mass extinction.\n\nThe community begins with relatively few pioneering plants and animals and develops through increasing complexity until it becomes stable or self-perpetuating as a climax community. The \"engine\" of succession, the cause of ecosystem change, is the impact of established species upon their own environments. A consequence of living is the sometimes subtle and sometimes overt alteration of one's own environment.\n\nIt is a phenomenon or process by which an ecological community undergoes more or less orderly and predictable changes following a disturbance or the initial colonization of a new habitat. Succession may be initiated either by formation of new, unoccupied habitat, such as from a lava flow or a severe landslide, or by some form of disturbance of a community, such as from a fire, severe windthrow, or logging. Succession that begins in new habitats, uninfluenced by pre-existing communities is called primary succession, whereas succession that follows disruption of a pre-existing community is called secondary succession.\n\nSuccession was among the first theories advanced in ecology. Ecological succession was first documented in the Indiana Dunes of Northwest Indiana and remains at the core of ecological science.\n\nPrecursors of the idea of ecological succession go back to the beginning of the 19th century. The French naturalist Adolphe Dureau de la Malle was the first to make use of the word \"succession\" concerning the vegetation development after forest clear-cutting. In 1859 Henry David Thoreau wrote an address called \"The Succession of Forest Trees\" in which he described succession in an oak-pine forest. \"It has long been known to observers that squirrels bury nuts in the ground, but I am not aware that any one has thus accounted for the regular succession of forests.\" The Austrian botanist Anton Kerner published a study about the succession of plants in the Danube river basin in 1863.\n\nHenry Chandler Cowles, at the University of Chicago, developed a more formal concept of succession. Inspired by studies of Danish dunes by Eugen Warming, Cowles studied vegetation development on sand dunes on the shores of Lake Michigan (the Indiana Dunes). He recognized that vegetation on dunes of different ages might be interpreted as different stages of a general trend of vegetation development on dunes (an approach to the study of vegetation change later termed space-for-time substitution, or chronosequence studies). He first published this work as a paper in the \"Botanical Gazette\" in 1899 (\"The ecological relations of the vegetation of the sand dunes of Lake Michigan\"). In this classic publication and subsequent papers, he formulated the idea of primary succession and the notion of a sere—a repeatable sequence of community changes specific to particular environmental circumstances.\n\nFrom about 1900 to 1960, however, understanding of succession was dominated by the theories of Frederic Clements, a contemporary of Cowles, who held that seres were highly predictable and deterministic and converged on a climatically determined stable climax community regardless of starting conditions. Clements explicitly analogized the successional development of ecological communities with ontogenetic development of individual organisms, and his model is often referred to as the pseudo-organismic theory of community ecology. Clements and his followers developed a complex taxonomy of communities and successional pathways.\n\nHenry Gleason offered a contrasting framework as early as the 1920s. The Gleasonian model was more complex and much less deterministic than the Clementsian. It differs most fundamentally from the Clementsian view in suggesting a much greater role of chance factors and in denying the existence of coherent, sharply bounded community types. Gleason argued that species distributions responded individualistically to environmental factors, and communities were best regarded as artifacts of the juxtaposition of species distributions. Gleason's ideas, first published in 1926, were largely ignored until the late 1950s.\n\nTwo quotes illustrate the contrasting views of Clements and Gleason. Clements wrote in 1916:\nwhile Gleason, in his 1926 paper, said:\nGleason's ideas were, in fact, more consistent with Cowles' original thinking about succession. About Clements' distinction between primary succession and secondary succession, Cowles wrote (1911):\n\nA more rigorous, data-driven testing of successional models and community theory generally began with the work of Robert Whittaker and John Curtis in the 1950s and 1960s. Succession theory has since become less monolithic and more complex. J. Connell and R. Slatyer attempted a codification of successional processes by mechanism. Among British and North American ecologists, the notion of a stable climax vegetation has been largely abandoned, and successional processes have come to be seen as much less deterministic, with important roles for historical contingency and for alternate pathways in the actual development of communities. Debates continue as to the general predictability of successional dynamics and the relative importance of equilibrial vs. non-equilibrial processes. Former Harvard professor F. A. Bazzaz introduced the notion of \"scale\" into the discussion, as he considered that at local or small area scale the processes are stochastic and patchy, but taking bigger regional areas into consideration, certain tendencies can not be denied.\n\nThe trajectory of successional change can be influenced by site conditions, by the character of the events initiating succession (perturbations), by the interactions of the species present, and by more stochastic factors such as availability of colonists or seeds or weather conditions at the time of disturbance. Some of these factors contribute to predictability of succession dynamics; others add more probabilistic elements. Two important perturbation factors today are human actions and climatic change.\n\nIn general, communities in early succession will be dominated by fast-growing, well-dispersed species (opportunist, fugitive, or r-selected life-histories). As succession proceeds, these species will tend to be replaced by more competitive (k-selected) species.\n\nTrends in ecosystem and community properties in succession have been suggested, but few appear to be general. For example, species diversity almost necessarily increases during early succession as new species arrive, but may decline in later succession as competition eliminates opportunistic species and leads to dominance by locally superior competitors. Net Primary Productivity, biomass, and trophic properties all show variable patterns over succession, depending on the particular system and site.\n\nEcological succession was formerly seen as having a stable end-stage called the climax, sometimes referred to as the 'potential vegetation' of a site, and shaped primarily by the local climate. This idea has been largely abandoned by modern ecologists in favor of nonequilibrium ideas of ecosystems dynamics. Most natural ecosystems experience disturbance at a rate that makes a \"climax\" community unattainable. Climate change often occurs at a rate and frequency sufficient to prevent arrival at a climax state. Additions to available species pools through range expansions and introductions can also continually reshape communities.\n\nThe development of some ecosystem attributes, such as soil properties and nutrient cycles, are both influenced by community properties, and, in turn, influence further successional development. This feed-back process may occur only over centuries or millennia. Coupled with the stochastic nature of disturbance events and other long-term (e.g., climatic) changes, such dynamics make it doubtful whether the 'climax' concept ever applies or is particularly useful in considering actual vegetation.\n\nSuccessional dynamics beginning with colonization of an area that has not been previously occupied by an ecological community, such as newly exposed rock or sand surfaces, lava flows, newly exposed glacial tills, etc., are referred to as primary succession. The stages of primary succession include pioneer plants (lichens and mosses), grassy stage, smaller shrubs, and trees. Animals begin to return when there is food there for them to eat. When it is a fully functioning ecosystem, it has reached the climax community stage. For example, parts of Acadia National Park in Maine went through primary succession.\nSuccessional dynamics following severe disturbance or removal of a pre-existing community are called secondary succession. Dynamics in secondary succession are strongly influenced by pre-disturbance conditions, including soil development, seed banks, remaining organic matter, and residual living organisms. Because of residual fertility and pre-existing organisms, community change in early stages of secondary succession can be relatively rapid. In a fragmented old field habitat created in eastern Kansas, woody plants \"colonized more rapidly (per unit area) on large and nearby patches\".\n\nSecondary succession is much more commonly observed and studied than primary succession. Particularly common types of secondary succession include responses to natural disturbances such as fire, flood, and severe winds, and to human-caused disturbances such as logging and agriculture. As an example, secondary succession has been occurring in Shenandoah National Park following the 1995 flood of the Mormon River, which destroyed plant and animal life. Today, plant and animal species are beginning to return.\n\nUnlike secondary succession, these types of vegetation change are not dependent on disturbance but are periodic changes arising from fluctuating species interactions or recurring events. These models modify the climax concept towards one of dynamic states.\n\nAutogenic succession can be brought by changes in the soil caused by the organisms there. These changes include accumulation of organic matter in litter or humic layer, alteration of soil nutrients, or change in the pH of soil due to the plants growing there. The structure of the plants themselves can also alter the community. For example, when larger species like trees mature, they produce shade on to the developing forest floor that tends to exclude light-requiring species. Shade-tolerant species will invade the area.\n\nAllogenic succession is caused by external environmental influences and not by the vegetation. For example, soil changes due to erosion, leaching or the deposition of silt and clays can alter the nutrient content and water relationships in the ecosystems. Animals also play an important role in allogenic changes as they are pollinators, seed dispersers and herbivores. They can also increase nutrient content of the soil in certain areas, or shift soil about (as termites, ants, and moles do) creating patches in the habitat. This may create regeneration sites that favor certain species.\n\nClimatic factors may be very important, but on a much longer time-scale than any other. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns will promote changes in communities. As the climate warmed at the end of each ice age, great successional changes took place. The tundra vegetation and bare glacial till deposits underwent succession to mixed deciduous forest. The greenhouse effect resulting in increase in temperature is likely to bring profound Allogenic changes in the next century. Geological and climatic catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, avalanches, meteors, floods, fires, and high wind also bring allogenic changes.\n\nIn 1916, Frederic Clements published a descriptive theory of succession and advanced it as a general ecological concept. His theory of succession had a powerful influence on ecological thought. Clements' concept is usually termed classical ecological theory.\nAccording to Clements, succession is a process involving several phases:\n\n\nA seral community is an intermediate stage found in an ecosystem advancing towards its climax community. In many cases more than one seral stage evolves until climax conditions are attained. A \"prisere\" is a collection of seres making up the development of an area from non-vegetated surfaces to a climax community. Depending on the substratum and climate, different seres are found.\n\nSuccession theory was developed primarily by botanists. The study of succession applied to whole ecosystems initiated in the writings of Ramon Margalef, while Eugene Odum’s publication of \"The Strategy of Ecosystem Development\" is considered its formal starting point.\n\nAnimal life also exhibit changes with changing communities. In lichen stage the fauna is sparse. It comprises few mites, ants and spiders living in the cracks and crevices. The fauna undergoes a qualitative increase during herb grass stage. The animals found during this stage include nematodes, insects larvae, ants, spiders, mites, etc. The animal population increases and diversifies with the development of forest climax community. The fauna consists of invertebrates like slugs, snails, worms, millipedes, centipedes, ants, bugs; and vertebrates such as squirrels, foxes, mice, moles, snakes, various birds, salamanders and frogs.\n\nSuccession of micro-organisms including fungi and bacteria occurring within a microhabitat is known as microsuccession or serule. This type of succession occurs in recently disturbed communities or newly available habitat, for example in recently dead trees, animal droppings, exposed glacial till, etc. Microbial communities may also change due to products secreted by the bacteria present. Changes of pH in a habitat could provide ideal conditions for a new species to inhabit the area. In some cases the new species may outcompete the present ones for nutrients leading to the primary species demise. Changes can also occur by microbial succession with variations in water availability and temperature. Theories of macroecology have only recently been applied to microbiology and so much remains to be understood about this growing field. A recent study of microbial succession evaluated the balances between stochastic and deterministic processes in the bacterial colonization of a salt marsh chronosequence. The results of this study show that, much like in macro succession, early colonization (primary succession) is mostly influenced by stochasticity while secondary succession of these bacterial communities was more strongly influenced by deterministic factors.\n\nAccording to classical ecological theory, succession stops when the sere has arrived at an equilibrium or steady state with the physical and biotic environment. Barring major disturbances, it will persist indefinitely. This end point of succession is called climax.\n\nThe final or stable community in a sere is the \"climax community\" or \"climatic vegetation\". It is self-perpetuating and in equilibrium with the physical habitat. There is no net annual accumulation of organic matter in a climax community. The annual production and use of energy is balanced in such a community.\n\n\n\nThere are three schools of interpretations explaining the climax concept:\n\n\nThe theory of alternative stable states suggests there is not one end point but many which transition between each other over ecological time.\n\nThe forests, being an ecological system, are subject to the species succession process. There are \"opportunistic\" or \"pioneer\" species that produce great quantities of seed that are disseminated by the wind, and therefore can colonize big empty extensions. They are capable of germinating and growing in direct sunlight. Once they have produced a \"closed canopy\", the lack of direct sun radiation at soil makes it difficult for their own seedlings to develop. It is then the opportunity for shade-tolerant species to become established under the protection of the pioneers. When the pioneers die, the shade-tolerant species replace them. These species are capable of growing beneath the canopy, and therefore, in the absence of catastrophes, will stay. For this reason it is then said the stand has reached its climax. When a catastrophe occurs, the opportunity for the pioneers opens up again, provided they are present or within a reasonable range.\n\nAn example of pioneer species, in forests of northeastern North America are \"Betula papyrifera\" (White birch) and \"Prunus serotina\" (Black cherry), that are particularly well-adapted to exploit large gaps in forest canopies, but are intolerant of shade and are eventually replaced by other shade-tolerant species in the absence of disturbances that create such gaps.\n\nThings in nature are not black and white, and there are intermediate stages. It is therefore normal that between the two extremes of light and shade there is a gradient, and there are species that may act as pioneer or tolerant, depending on the circumstances. It is of paramount importance to know the tolerance of species in order to practice an effective silviculture.\n\n\n"}

In addition to numerous common law rules limiting their operation, in England and Wales Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 applies to all contracts, but the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, unlike the common law rules, do differentiate between contracts between businesses and contracts between business and consumer, so the law seems to explicitly recognize the greater possibility of exploitation of the consumer by businesses.\n\nThere are various methods by which a party may seek to exclude or mitigate liability by use of a contractual term:\n\n\nThe courts have traditionally held that exclusion clauses only operate if they are actually part of the contract. There seem to be three methods of incorporation:\n\n\nFor an exclusion clause to operate, it must cover the breach (assuming there actually is a breach of contract). If there is, then the type of liability arising is also important. Generally, there are two varieties of liability: strict liability (liability arising due to a state of affairs without the party at breach necessarily being at fault) and liability for negligence (liability arising due to fault).\n\nThe courts have a tendency of requiring the party relying on the clause to have drafted it properly so that it exempts them from the liability arising, and if any ambiguity is present, the courts usually interpret it strictly against the party relying on the clause.\n\nAs espoused in \"Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd\", the meaning of an exclusion clause is construed in its ordinary and natural meaning in the context. Although we construe the meaning much like any other ordinary clause in the contract, we need to examine the clause in light of the contract as a whole. Exclusion clauses should not be subject to a strained construction in order to reduce the ambit of their operation. The judge in \"R&B Customs Brokers Co Ltd v United Dominions Trust Ltd\" refused to allow an exemption clause, of which did cover the nature of the implied term, on the grounds that it did not make specific and explicit reference to that term.\n\nIf, after attempting to construe an exclusion clause (or indeed any other contractual term) in accord with its ordinary and natural meaning of the words, there is still ambiguity then (if the clause was imposed by one party upon the other without negotiation) the contra proferentem rule applies. Essentially this means that the clause will be construed against the interests of the person who proposed its inclusion. that is to say, \"contra\" (against) the \"proferens\" (proposer).\n\nIn terms of negligence, the courts have taken the approach that it is unlikely that someone would enter into a contract that allows the other party to evade fault based liability. As a result, if a party wishes exempt his liability for negligence, he must make sure that the other parties understand that. The decision in \"Canada SS Lines Ltd v. The King\" held that:\n\nIn Australia, the \"four corners rule\" has been adopted in preference over the idea of a \"fundamental breach\". The court will presume that parties to a contract will not exclude liability for losses arising from acts not authorised under the contract. However, if acts of negligence occur during authorised acts, then the exclusion clauses shall still apply;\n\nIf the contract is for the carriage of goods, if the path is deviated from what was agreed, any exclusion clauses no longer apply.\n\nIn Australia, exclusion clauses have been recognised as valid by the High Court. They do not apply in cases of deliberate breach.\n\nEven if terms are incorporated into the contract and so would be effective, there are various statutory controls over the types of terms that may have legal effect. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 renders many exemption clauses ineffective. The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 provide further protection for consumers.\n\n16.

{"id": "9901525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9901525", "title": "Financial Interest and Syndication Rules", "text": "Financial Interest and Syndication Rules\n\nThe Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, widely known as the fin-syn rules, were a set of rules imposed by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States in 1970. The FCC sought to prevent the Big Three television networks from monopolizing the broadcast landscape by preventing them from owning any of the programming that they aired in prime time. The rules also prohibited networks from airing syndicated programming they had a financial stake in. The rules changed the power relationships between networks and television producers, who often had to agree to exorbitant profit participation in order to have their shows aired. Some argue the rules brought about a golden era of independent television production by companies such as MTM Enterprises (\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\") and Norman Lear's Tandem Productions (\"All in the Family\"). Others argue the rules made the work of independent television production companies much more difficult because smaller companies could never afford the deficit financing required unless they received network assistance.\n\nControversial from the very beginning, the fin-syn rule was relaxed slightly during the 1980s. Following the severe changes in the television landscape, such as the rise of the Fox network and cable television, the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules were abolished completely in 1993.\n\nIt was the repeal of fin-syn that ultimately made newer broadcast networks such as UPN and The WB financially interesting for their highly vertically integrated parent media conglomerates Paramount Pictures (Viacom) and Time Warner, respectively.\n\nOn average, the number of shows that have been broadcast during prime time by the three main networks (CBS, NBC and ABC) per season has ranged between 63 and 75 shows between the 1987-88 and 2001-02 seasons. In the 1987-88 season, out of a total of 66 primetime shows that were broadcast, there were no such shows in which the network was either a producer or a co-producer. This number rose steadily to the point that during the 1992-93 season, there were about six shows out of a total of 67 shows produced or co-produced by the network; however as a result of the repeal of the fin-syn rules, this figure jumped to 11 the following year, whilst the total number of shows was barely 73. For the 2001-02 season, this figure rose to 20 shows that were network produced – a change from 0%, to 9%, to 15% and from there to 20% – over two decades.\n\nToday, each of the five major networks has an affiliated syndication company:\n\nClosely related to fin-syn, the Prime Time Access Rule sought to strengthen local and independent producers by preventing affiliates from airing network programming during much of the early evening hours. This rule was eliminated on August 30, 1996.\n\nBefore the fin-syn rules, the networks attained greater control and less risk by forcing production companies to deficit finance their programs while also demanding a percentage of the syndication revenues. Deficit financing is an arrangement in which the network pays the studio that makes a show a license fee in exchange for the right to air the program. The license fee is in exchange for the right to air an episode a few times (as a first-run and rerun episode), and does not cover the complete cost of production. The studio remains in ownership of the show. Before the fin-syn rules were established, networks would put into practice \"profit participation.\" With this, they gained greater control and avoided the risks by forcing the production companies to deficit finance their programs. Such practice led multiple production companies into financial hardships. Independent producers and those not signed with major working studios were hit the hardest because most of the profit revenue went to the networks. Author Amanda D. Lotz explains in her book \"The Television Will Be Revolutionized\" that, by the mid-1960s, the networks gained as much as 91% of the programming revenue from profit participation. It was at that point that the government stepped in and got involved with the fin-syn rules in the 1970s.\n\nDeficit financing minimized the substantial risks and costs of developing programs for the networks while initially affording the studios considerable benefits as well. In successful cases, the studio receives a large return on its investment when it re-sells the show in a combination of syndication windows because the sales provide nearly pure profit: no additional work typically goes into the program and the network receives none of the payment. However, if the show is cancelled by the network before producing enough episodes to be syndicated, or if no syndication buyers want the show, the production company must absorb the difference between the cost of production and the original license fee, which can now amount to millions of dollars for each season.\n\n, most reality television producers believe that deficit financing will never be financially viable because the vast majority of reality production companies are too small to wait long enough for the big payoff. Instead of syndication, producers have been covering gaps between license fees and rising production costs by selling shows' formats to foreign territories and developing integrated marketing deals with advertisers.\n\nThe fin-syn rules created two well-defined periods that might be considered characteristics of the multi-channel transition. First; rise of independent studios that provided a competitive environment. Second; The Walt Disney Company, Viacom, News Corporation and Time Warner made purchases that combined studios and networks to create new kinds of corporate entities.\n\nThroughout the 1970s into the mid-1990s, the fin-syn rules broke a few network-era norms that created programming well before the adjustments to the multi-channel transition. This also led to the creation of a fluid competitive environment between network and studios, however this did not last long.\n\nIn 1983, the FCC had received demands from the networks to end the fin-syn rules. In 1991, these had officially materialized, and the agency's commissioners voted to eliminate the rules in 1993. After the rules were eliminated, networks began populating their schedules with new shows purchased from studios owned by the network.\n\nThroughout all this, the audience began to have more choices and control over entertainment options, and networks were pressured to offer fewer reruns to keep viewers' attention, leading networks to create programming.\n"}

The Gesamtbedeutung of a language's past tense, for instance, might be conceived as \"distance from the present\". This meaning might later be generalized to refer to events both temporally distant (e.g. \"the box was empty\") as well as separated in terms of reality or likelihood (e.g. \"the box might be empty\", \"if the box were empty...\", \"the box could be empty\", etc.)\n\nIn Japanese, for example, the tense system has been reduced to a system of \"past\", \"non-past\", and \"probable\", where the latter two tenses share the Gesamtbedeutung of abstraction from the real. The past tense refers to events which are complete and definite, whereas the non-past refers to virtually everything else, including present and future events. The probable tense functions in much the same way as the non-past, but with a stronger sense of separation from the present reality. \n\nFor another example, consider the English word endings \"-ing\" and \"-er\". Both share a Gesamtbedeutung of agency (as opposed to that of patienthood, represented by such morphemes as \"-ed\" and \"-ee\"). One who is \"driving\" is, by definition, a \"driver\".

{"id": "48272737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48272737", "title": "Indian Languages Festival", "text": "Indian Languages Festival\n\nILF Samanvay, initiated by the India Habitat Centre, is a one-of-its-kind Indian Languages Festival held annually in New Delhi. The first Samanvay was held in 2011. ILF Samanvay was conceived in 2011 as an annual celebration of writing in Indian languages. The festival has aimed at generating dialogue across Indian languages at various levels and has emerged as the only literature festival dedicated exclusively to Indian languages.\n\nThe inaugural edition (2011) tried to explore the problem of bringing various literatures under the master signifier, \"Indian\" and the mysterious bond that makes these various literatures at once distinct and collective. In 2012, the festival moved on to highlight and discover the heritage of Indian languages through the strain of Boli, Baani, Bhasha: Gaon, Kasba, Shehar. Even in 2013 the theme Jodti Zubanein, Judti Zubanein: Language Connections aimed at -discussing the various kinds of dialogues across the 'regional' languages and their multifaceted interaction with the 'national' languages - Hindi and English. In 2014, Samanvay highlighted ‘Translation/Transnation’\nfocus on Indian languages which have a transnational presence.\n\nThe first four editions of the festival featured 20 languages presented by more than 150 Writers including some of the contemporary masters like Sitakant Mahapatra, Ratan Thiyam, K. Satchidanandan, Ashok Vajpeyi, Sheen Kaaf Nizam, Girish Kasaravalli,\nUdaya Narayana Singh, Nabarun Bhattacharya, Rajendra Yadav, Mangalesh Dabral,\nYumlembam Ibomcha, Arjun Deo Charan, Anupam \nMishra, Gulzar, Jerry Pinto, Ketan Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Mukul Kesavan,\nPiyush Mishra, Ravish Kumar, Sharada Sinha, Sanjay Kak, Shashi Deshpande,\nKavita Krishnan, Vrinda Grover, Kancha Ilaiah,\nAlok Rai, K.

The festival, which has over the years become a must-attend for the Capital's Art & Culture aficionados, has expanded its scope to engage a wider range of audience by bringing into its panels, multi-level interpretations of the central theme, ‘Insider/Outsider: Writing India’s Dreams and Realities’. The languages that will be explored in detail at ILF Samanvay. 2015 languages are Tamil, Bangla, Marathi and Dogri.\n\nAmid rampant instability of thought and violence infecting communication, ILF \"Samanvay\" aspires\nto thrive as a space for relevant reflection and uninhibited celebration of the inherent companionship of Indian linguistic cultures. Its overall design, including that of all its intellectual, physical and virtual sites, thus evokes India's cultural destiny vis-à-vis its multiple political aspirations on the one hand and the future of humanity at large on the other. Hence, the festival design reflects the concerns and responsibility of the Indian writers, artists and other creative thinkers towards creating a condition and environment to bring the multi-centred country into a cultural camaraderie rather than any attempt\nat homogenisation.\n\nThe ILF Samanvay logo is the visual embodiment of the above design concept. While the curious\ninterweaving of straight lines and curves in the scripting of the term ‘Samanvay’ has from its inception reflected the continuum of tradition and modernity that the festival emphasises, it is branded as ILF Samanvay in its fifth year, considering its one-of-its-kind status in the country as a festival bringing Indian languages together. \"The revised logo marks the directional integrity in the organisation of the festival.\"\n\nArtist Riyas Komu who conceptualised the new visual expression of the ILF Samanvay logo says: \"In our times characterized by fragile thoughts and volatile expressions, an Indian languages festival such as \"Samanvay\" must live and present itself as a profound space for thinking. It must be a site to reflect on the past, present and future of humanity and nature at large. Hence, the attempt here has been to create a \"head space\" that represents the thoughtscape embedded in Indian languages. Again, as we need an insignia for thinkers who can make relevant changes, the red dot becomes the mark of that awareness. The seven colours of the spectrum, capable of forming white light on their merger, are laid in a seed form in the line above the lettering of Samanvay in the logo. Another indication of the 'coming together' inherent in the festival, this linear mandala also intimates one of the possibility of playing with each of these colours in specific contexts within the frame of the festival.\"\n\nThe festival will open with Education Thinker, Prof. Aijaz Ahmad discussing the possibility of evolving a methodology for language and literary studies in the country. Prof. Ahmad's inaugural lecture, ‘The Languages of a Union’, will highlight how in India, political unity does not automatically give us, or requires of us, literary or linguistic unity. He would discuss the significance of examining the hierarchical relations existing among languages and traditions, and the need to develop a system of education that profoundly addresses the question of multilingualism.\n\nThe deliberations at Samanvay 2015 will unfold with a session paying tributes to the late RK Laxman and his matchless legacy. Cartoonist Unny, Outlook Chief Editor Krishna Prasad, and cartoon researcher and writer, Christel Devadawson will together unravel the complex field of Indian cartooning while looking at Laxman's unique contribution to shaping its sensibilities. This session on the opening evening will lead the discourse of ‘Insider/Outsider’ forward into the main festival sessions.\n\nThe central theme of Samanvay 2015, Insider/Outsider: Writing India's Dreams and Realities,\nevokes the liminality of the writer/creative artist/inventor in a given context. A creative act necessitates an individual to move out of a certain state of being, into an experimental space where she has to play out her ideas and desires into comprehensible forms. This transition makes every writer a liminal\nbeing, an insider/outsider. Yet, some writers and artists become more of insiders and some others more of outsiders to the existing patterns. The subtitle suggests how writers who understand the in-between space of uncertainty, the transitory status that makes one neither here nor there, bring out the dreams and realities of a complex space such as India. It also points to the need for an artist to remain\ntentative, and resist fixities.\n\nDay 2 of Samanvay will focus on a thematic exploration of ‘Insider/Outsider’ in the contemporary socio-political and cultural context of India. Day 3 will feature sessions on the focal languages of Samanvay 2015, and Day 4 will attempt to expand the theme with the futuristic vision which the festival embodies.\n\nVarious workshops, volunteer sessions, conversations, book exhibitions and performances will also be an integral part of Samanvay 2015. Its democratic and inclusive spirit gets amply reflected in a special session on Day 2, which is completely designed by the student volunteers of Samanvay. This one-hour session titled Inside the Exile will feature readings by Tibetan writers followed by a Q&A to explore the Insider/Outsider aspects of being Tibetans in India. This session, among others, has ensured more youth participation in the organization of the festival. At Samanvay, the workshop sessions are not supplementary but are integral to the exploration of languages outside of the verbal realm, too. On\nDay 3, a translation workshop has been planned with exercises that would lead to a publication. Avadhesh Kumar Singh, Dean of School of Translation Studies at IGNOU will be in charge of this.\n\nSpread over four days with multiple events, ILF Samanvay 2015 will ensure that the theme is carried on to extra-literary and epistemic fields too. The sessions concerning the child's position vis-a-vis writing and publishing in the country; gender and sexuality; media and language; the architectural, ecological and cultural continuities and discontinuities that make the city of Delhi etc. are cases in point. The Art Appreciation workshop by the renowned cultural critic Sadanand Menon is a major value addition in this regard.\n\nTalking about the festival, Rakesh Kacker, Festival Director Samanvay & Director - India Habitat Centre , says, “One does not necessarily have to recognise language as a basic instinct to properly appreciate its role as an organic part of human existence. Civilizations have been formed and continue to take shape around languages, uniting and dividing in swift strokes. This, precisely, is the theme we would explore in India Habitat Centre’s fifth annual Indian Languages’ Festival, Samanvay. In an increasingly globalised world the alienation that writers often face for their lingual and cultural choices is now a much hackneyed subject in the area of literary discourse. Here at Samanvay, we invite you to partake in the discussions that would take this conversation one step forward.”\n\nElaborating further, Rizio Yohannan Raj, Creative Director, ILF Samanvay says, \"“Samanvay\" is a relevant call to reawaken the Indian genius for cultural cooperation in our times. A dynamic yet nuanced\ninitiative to facilitate genuine camaraderie at the intersections of Indian languages, the festival celebrates the diversities embedded in the transnational matrix of the country. Through multiple verbal as well as transverbal media, and various modes of translation, \"Samanvay\" interprets \"Indian Languages\" beyond \"word-limits\" and explores the socio-historical connections among the idioms of literature, visual arts, music, performance. Towards fulfilling this larger vision of creativity and\ninstitutionalising its enterprise, \"Samanvay’s\" inclusive framework presents workshops, freewheeling conversations, focussed discussions, public readings, exhibitions, performances. The festival theme for\n2015, “Insider/Outsider: Writing India’s Dreams and Realities” emphasises the liminality of the creative individual in any given context, and all the sessions explore this notion quite intensely, thus lending the festival an organic as well as sustainable design.”\n\nThe distinguished speakers include Tenzin Tsunde, Jeet Thayil, TM Krishna, Urvashi Butalia, Aman Nath, Ayesha Kidwai, Sadanand Menon, Bhuchung Sonam, EP Unny, Arunava Sinha, Sachin Ketkar, AR Venkatachalapathy, Rakshanda Jalil, Bulbul Sharma, Avadhesh Kumar Singh, K Satchidanandan, Meena Alexander, Sharmila Seyyid, Padma Sachdev, Rosalyn DeMello, Khushbu, Kannan Sundaram, Shubro\nBandyopadhyay, Dolochampa Chakravary, Ashok Vajpeyi Ramkumar Mukhopadhyay, Makarand Sathe, Iravati Karve, Vaibhav Abnave, Dharmakriti Sumant, Samina Mishra, Jerry Pinto, Radhika Menon, J Devika, Manabi Bandyopadhya, Saleem Kidwai, Priya Sarukkari Chhabria, Arundhathi Subramanian, H.S Shiva Prakash, Navtej Johar, Maya Krishna Rao, Anuradha Kapur, Come Carpentier, Fareeda Mehta, Margaret Mascarenhas.\n\nILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2015\n\nTamil writer Peruman Murugan's novel Madhorubhagan has bagged the fourth \"ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman\", the prestigious annual award instituted by the IHC Indian Languages Festival Samanvay. The award for 2015 was decided by an eminent jury chaired by K. Satchidanandan, and included as its other members Sachin Ketkar, Manglesh Dabral, Mitra Phukan and Arundhati Subramaniam. The Jury selected \"Madhorubhagan\" after a detailed process of inviting nominations from five focal languages of ILF Samanvay 2015– Tamil, Marathi, Bangla, Dogri and Mizo. These nominations were then screened by the Award Advisors and a final selection was made by the Jury from the final\nshortlist.\n\nJury Chair K Satchidanandan says:\n\n\"Perual Murugan's \"Madhorubhagan\" (One Part Woman) is a rooted and passionate work of fiction that narrates with searing intensity and unsparing clarity the story of a relationship caught between the dictates of social convention and the tug of personal anxieties. This historian of the Kongu region of Tamilnadu has brought into play his lyrical imagination, linguistic skill and lexical knowledge in this honest exploration of the tyranny of caste and the pathology of a community. Inspired by local folklore and history, this great work of fiction dreams of a secular future for communities in India that remain hostage to the ways of the past. It is an imaginative contribution by a versatile writer and scholar to the collective struggle for a new India free from the oppression of caste and enslaving conventions.\"\n\nResponding to the award announcement Perumal Murugan gave this statement:\n\nThe IHC Director who is also the Festival Director of ILF Samanvay says: ‘It gives the IHC great pleasure to announce the ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman for Perumal Murugan. The Tamil literary canon has been expanded with the induction of the series of novels and short stories that Perumal Murugan has written. \"Madhorubhagan\" occupies pride of place in this canon. This award for \"Madhorubhagan\" is a recognition of how a writer and his insider-outsider act of writing could serve the society and connect its histories with its contemporary realities and dreams.”\n\nPerumal Murugan is a well-known Tamil writer and poet. He has written nine novels and four\ncollections each of short stories and poetry. Three of his novels have been translated into English to wide critical acclaim: \"Seasons of the Palm,\" which was shortlisted for the prestigious Kiriyama Prize in 2005, \"Current Show\" and \"One part woman.\" He has received awards from the Tamil Nadu government as well as from Katha Books.\n\nThe \"ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman\" has undergone a makeover this year. Till last year, named Samanvay Bhasha Samman, this honour was bestowed on an eminent writer who had contributed significantly to the growth of one or more Indian languages. Last year, the third Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2014 was conferred upon Ashok Vajpeyi, the well-known author, scholar, critic and poet for his lifelong contribution to Hindi Literature in particular and Indian Literature in general. The second Samanvay Bhasha Samman 2013 was conferred upon veteran Gujarati author Chandrakant Topiwala for \"his lifetime contribution to Gujarati and Indian literature; for his commitment for independence and objectivity in cultural life; for standing against the authoritarian forces in contemporary Indian society and broadening the scope of human empathy through an extraordinary body of work.\"\n\nThe inaugural award in 2012 had been conferred upon the legendary Odiya writer Sitakant Mahapatra for \"his lifetime contribution to Odiya and Indian literature; for extraordinary efforts in generating dialogue across Indian languages through creative and administrative activism, for emancipation of dialects and oral traditions and for unrelenting advocacy of plurality of idea and expression.\"\n\nIn this fifth year of India Habit Centre's Indian Languages Festival Samanvay, as part of the rethinking of the festival as a significant and enduring space to facilitate growth, development of connections of Indian languages in the contemporary times, it was decided that every year, an important literary work in one of the focal languages of the festival, should be given the award, as such a scheme is more aligned to the vision and mission of the ILF Samanvay. Hence, the Award has been named ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman, and from a cluster of five languages from the five regions of the country—Tamil, Bangla, Dogri, Marathi and Mizo— nominations were called from a large panel of publishers, academicians, critics/writers. Works—Poetry Fiction Creative non-fiction; e.g. Autobiographies, Travelogues, Memoirs, etc.—published in the last 5 years in these languages were considered. To begin the process, each language's advisers suggested 5 critics/writers, 5 academicians, and 5 publishers who sent in their nominations in an elaborate format prepared for this purpose. Each nominator sent 3 nominations, and filled up the questionnaire in justification of the nomination.\n\nCriteria for nominations specified that the book should:\n\ni) Preferably have been translated in any other Indian Language. This criterion, however, is NOT mandatory.\n\nii) Have been published between Jan 2010—Dec 2014.\n\niii) Be considered significant in the particular language.\n\niv) Have brought a breakthrough in the literary scenario of that particular language.\n\nv) Have extended the frontiers of language and style vi) be not just commercial but aesthetically rich.\n\nvi) Have some social and/or literary substance to it.\n\nvii) Challenge established norms.\n\nviii) Have brought a shift in the canon.\n\nix) Have made a considerable impact on the language it has been written in.\n\nx) The advisers are free to add books over and above the nominations received per language.\n\nThe advisers of Bangla, Dogri, Marathi and Tamil shortlisted 2 books per language. Though nominations were received from Mizo, the advisors did not recommend any for the award. Each panel of advisors of the four languages prepared a critical justification for the members of the jury explaining their choice for the 2 books shortlisted. From among these 8 nominations the jury members chose Perumal Murugan's \"Madhorubhagan\".\n\nShortlisted works\n\n1. Bangla\n\nPrabal Kumar Basu, \"Bhalo Bolte Shikhun\", Anita Agnihotri, \"Desher Bhitor Desh\"\n\n2. Dogri\n\nOm Goswami, \"Unni Sou Santali\", Lalit Magotra, \"Hello Maya\"\n\n3.

Tamil\n\nPerumal Murugan, \"Madhorubhagan\", Imayam, \"Savu Soru\"\n\nThe award ceremony is scheduled between 6pm and 7pm on Saturday the 28th of November at the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi.\n\nThe commitment of ILF Samanvay to the development of a democracy of Indian languages \nis asserted by the announcement of a major Award for a distinguished translator, and a couple of interesting prizes for young writers. In the wake of Tamil Writer Peruman Murugan's novel Madhorubhagan (One Part Woman) bagging the fourth \"ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman\", the festival organisers have announced yet another much-awaited and relevant annual award which ILF Samanvay has instituted in collaboration with Vani Foundation: Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award.\n\nScheduled from 26 to 29 November 2015, ILF Samanvay 2015 has expanded its scope to engage a wider section of the society. It is as part of enlarging its mandate that a national level award for a distinguished translator who has contributed in a sustained and quality manner towards direct\nexchanges between two Indian languages, has been instituted. This award will be given as part of the activities initiated by ILF Samanvay every year. The India Habitat Centre and Vani Foundation have jointly conceptualised this award in view of the lack of recognitions encouraging direct exchanges between Indian languages without a mediating language. This award is hoped to encourage contemporary translators in the linguistically diverse sub-continent with a rich history of literary\nexchange.\n\nThe award is worth INR 1,00,000 (Rupees One lakh) and as far as possible this award will consider translators directly translating between two Indian languages and have sustained this activity for a\nconsiderable period of time and produced a remarkable body of work. The jury of the award include writers Namita Gokhale, Ashok Vajpeyi, Rizio Yohannan Raj, IHC Programmes Director Vidyun Singh, NBT Director and writer Rita Choudhury, and writer-scholar Rita Kothari.\n\nAnnouncing the institution of Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Award, the Director\nof India Habitat Centre, Rakesh Kacker said: \"I am delighted that this award has fructified in a very short period. Thanks and Congratulations to all who have made this happen. The addition of this award to ILF Samanvay's range of activities will help to enrich the festival and its institutional mission. It would also strengthen the important work of translation and help different linguistic groups in the country to communicate meaningfully with one another.\"\n\nArun Maheshwari, the Chairman of Vani Foundation, that has co-founded the Award, said on the occasion: \"Our country's rich cultural diversity and its expression into arts and literature have been\nlargely unexplored. Vani Foundation was established with the mission of not only re-discovering these idioms, but also connecting Indian languages with one another and with the world. We found congruence of energy and vision with the new team at ILF \"Samanvay\" and\ntherefore feel proud to announce \"Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator Awa\"rd. The award is committed to celebrate the unsung heroes of Indian translation fraternity, especially those who have\ntirelessly dedicated themselves to not only translating between two languages, but also bridging two cultures.\"\n\nThe Vani-Samanvay Distinguished Translator award is in keeping with the great emphasis ILF Samanvay has laid on translation this year. The festival has initiated a collaborative translation project with the School of Translation Studies and Training, IGNOU, besides three festival panels dedicated exclusively to look at various issues concerning translation in the county.\n\nAs part of expanding its mandate, and reaching out to nurture the creativity of the young speakers of different Indian languages in the Delhi-NCR region, ILF Samanvay has also announced an interesting youth poetry contest as part of the festival: The HIR-PITHARA YOUTH POETRY CONTEST. The mascot of this poetry contest is the resplendent figure of HIR—the ageless, androgynous, itinerant storyteller.(Mascot attached)\n\nSpeaking of Hir, Rizio Yohannan Raj, Creative Director of ILF Samanvay said: \"Hir (Pronounced ‘heer’) is a quintessential \"insider-outsider\", true to the time and the theme-zone wherein hir arrives at ILF Samanvay in Delhi. Hir is a child-adult of the future, and begins hir travel mid-way, in classic medias\nres, at ILF Samanvay. Hir is pronoun and noun at once; Hir is a child's self-expression as well as an adult's quest for meaning. Hir represents the ‘samanvay’ of the self and the other in our fragmented times. Red-robed, Hir is the self-same heart of pure revolution and ardent love. In the coming days, we shall see Hir extending travel from Delhi to different time zones, varied spacescapes, carrying hir\n‘Pithara’ , gathering creative voices from among the young and the young at heart of the country. Inspired by the 9-year old Adel Tushar Kumar's uninhibited painting of a storyteller, Hir is given hir current form by the ILF Samanvay team. Hir Stories are going to be a regular feature of Y\": The ILF Samanvay Blog.\"\"\n\nILF Samanvay 2015 invites poetry submissions for the HIR-PITHARA poetry contest 2015 in all Indian languages. One can submit any number of poems in one’s original language, on the theme\n\"Insider/Outsider’. The length of poem has to be limited to one A4 size page, and has to be separately submitted in the specified format, along with a translation in either English or Hindi.\n\nThis journey of Hir in the context of IL F Samanvay through the historical city of Delhi is to map, mainstream and celebrate Delhi's hidden pockets of creativity. Poetry submissions can either be made online in the requisite format available on www.ilfsamanvay.org or dropped at the \"Hir-Pitharas\" (Poetry bags) kept at the IHC campus in Lodhi Road and in select locations. The hard copy submission must mark the name, age, address and affiliation of the participant. Details will be available online at\nthe ILF Samanvay website from Tuesday, 20 October.\n\nThe last date of submission is 5 Nov 2015. Seven poets from different languages will be selected and they will be invited to read their prize-winning entry at the theme session of ILF Samanvay 2015 on 27 Nov 2015 evening, along with senior poets from different languages.\n\nILF Samanvay invites young people in the city to write poetry in their own languages and reclaim the lost vitality of a region that inspired many a poet and artist to make monumental works of beauty for\ngenerations to cherish.\n\nAnnouncement of winners: 18 November\n\nThe Hir-e-Pithara Twitter Poetry Contest is a Twitter-only contest that recognizes how information technology, and specifically social media platforms have created new literary expressions, quite distinct from all other ages. The contest is open to poets in all the 22 This fresh mode is a product of its time, and this contest is ILF Samanvay's way to understand and nurture it as a specific movement of the times we are living in.\n\nParticipants can send in one submission in one tweet, based on the theme \"Insider/Outsider\" by 5 November 2015. A participant can submit any number of tweet poems. The participants can choose to send either a poem originally in English or in translation from any of the 22 languages in the eighth schedule. The participants have to hashtag the first 3 characters of the original language (E.g.: #MAL for Malayalam, #ENG for English etc.). One winning entry will be awarded the ILF Samanvay New Age Creativity Certificate. The winner of the HIR-E-PITHARA contest will also get a chance to recite their\nwork along with the winners of the HIR PITHARA Youth poetry contest.\n\nThe contest will be open at the twitter handle @ILFSamanvay from 21 Oct 2015. Every entry must be accompanied with the hashtag #HIR. To enter the contest follow us @ILFSamanvay and send in your tweets.\n"}

He predicts that working out the histories of the languages will be a \"profound challenge\", regardless of whether they are a genealogical family or a language area.\n\nMarrgu and Wurrugu, previously lumped in with Iwaidjan, have little in common with it and may turn out to be a separate family.\n\nIwaidja is spoken by about 150 people in the community of Minjilang on Croker Island, alongside English, Kunwinjku and Maung. Maung is primarily spoken in the community of Warruwi on Goulburn Island, and it too has about 150 speakers.

Also unusual is the velar approximant , which is an areal feature shared with Tiwi and Kunbarlang.\n\nThe vocabularies of all the Iwaidjan languages contain loanwords from Macassarese and Malay, both Malayo-Polynesian languages from Indonesia. Iwaidja and Maung have also borrowed heavily from Kunwijku, another Australian language of the Gunwingguan family.\n\nWhile the Iwaidjan languages share a number of features with other non-Pama–Nyungan language families, it is uncertain which they are closest related to.

{"id": "33489345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33489345", "title": "Medumba language", "text": "Medumba language\n\nMedumba (\"Mə̀dʉ̂mbɑ̀\" ) is a Grassfields language of Cameroon. The people who speak it originate from the Nde division of the West Region of the country, with their main settlements in Bangangté, Bakong, Bangoulap, Bahouoc, Bagnoun and Tonga. It is a major Bamileke language, and is located in an area where sacred kingship played a pivotal role in government, justice, and diplomacy. The modern history of the Bamileke area, which was a German colony placed under French trusteeship by the League of Nations in 1919, is closely associated with the nationalist movement of the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), which developed primarily in the coastal hinterland (Bassa) and the western highlands (Bamileke). From 1956 to the late 1960s, this area of Cameroon experienced a period of unrest; this episode continues to shape Bamileke political culture, and has an impact on language identity and the linguistic landscape.\n\nThe Medumba-speaking area is famous for a bi-annual cultural festival — \"FESTAC: \" (Medumba Arts and Crafts Festival) — that promotes the Medumba language, as well as dance, artwork and food styles of the 14 different villages of the locality. The festival, which takes place over a 2-week period in early July, is hosted in Bangangte.\n\nMedumba is part of the Eastern Group of the Bamileke Cluster, which also include Fe'fe', Ghomálá', Kwa', and Nda'nda'. The Bamileke cluster — along with Ngemba, Nkambe and Nun — is part of the Eastern Grassfields subgroup which, together with the Ring languages and the Southwest Grassfields languages, constitute the Grassfield Bantu grouping. \nMedumba figures prominently in linguistic research on the Bamileke cluster, partly because of the high quality of the work done by Jan Voorhoeve in the 1960s and 1970s, including work on (in chronological order):\n\nThis work was pursued by L. Hyman in the 1980s, on the closely related language Fe'fe' (add refs). It was re-invigorated in the early 2010s by research groups at Boston University (lead by C. O'Connor) and at the University of British Columbia (lead by R.-M. Déchaine). Some of these publications include:\nAlso notable are the scholarly contributions of Medumba speaker-linguists, including (in chronological order):\nRecent work on Medumba is part of a more general push towards documenting the languages of Africa, in the face of rising levels of language endangerment. Cameroon — along with Nigeria, Sudan, and Ethiopia — is reported to have one of the highest language mortality rates in Africa.\n\nEfforts to develop a Medumba orthography date back to the beginning of the 20th century, and are associated with the following milestones:\n\nCurrently, educational materials, literature and dictionaries for the language are produced by CEPOM, based in Bangangte. The combined output of missionary and CEPOM work has produced more that 80 publications on Medumba language and culture; these are published in French, English, and Medumba. Over time, publications in Medumba have used six different orthographies:\nThe current alphabet is given in Table 1.\n\nIn addition to simplex consonants, Medumba has numerous complex consonants, and these are represented as digraphs or trigraphs; see Table 2. Nasals, stops, and fricatives can be labliazed; in the orthography this is represented as a CW digraph. Stops and fricatives can be pre-nasalized; in the orthography this is represented as an NC digraph or an NCW trigraph.\n\nOrthographic conventions for tone-marking are as follows:\nRecent developments in digital literacy have had an impact on Medumba. For example, a seven-language electronic calendar — in French, English, and the five national languages (Medumba, Ghomala, Yemba, Meta, Kom) — sends information on time and date to an LCD screen via a VGA controller. The calendar has been developed as a way of mitigating the impact of language competition, and with the specific goal of raising the profile and prestige of the national languages in a context of language endangerment.\n\nRadio FM 100 Medumba was established in 2000 by \"Medumba Kum Ntsi\".\n\nInitial research on the Medumba segment inventory was conducted by Voorhoeve in the early 1960s, and published in Voorhoeve (1965). He identified15 vowels and 40 consonants. Not described by Voorhoeve (1965) are the plain and pre-nasalized bilabial trills /B/, /ᵐB/, which occur most often before central vowels /ʉ, ə/, which brings the total number of consonants to 42. The following two subsections survey the vowel and consonant inventory.\n\nMedumba has a 10 simplex vowels, and 5 complex vowels (diphthongs).\n\nTable 3 gives the inventory of simple vowels, which include 5 closed (high) vowels /i, ʉ, u, ɪ, ʊ/ and 5 non-closed (non-high) /e, ə, o, a, ɑ/. See (1-10) for examples.\n\"\"\n\nSee Table 4 for the inventory of the five diphthongs, which include /ia, iə, ʉa, ʉɑ, uɑ/. See (11-15) for examples.\n\"\"\nDiphthongs iinvolve a combination of a closed (high) vowel (V1) /i,ʉ,u/ with a non-closed (non-high) vowel (V2) /a,ə,ɑ/, as follows:\n\nThe canonical morpheme in Medumba is a single syllable, either an open CV syllable or a closed CVC syllable (Voorhoeve 1965:319). This morpheme structure constraint has consequences for the consonant inventory. Indeed, a notable property of Medumba is that the number of contrastive consonants differs according to whether one considers consonants in onset position (i.e., consonants that begin a CV or CVC syllable) or consonants in coda position (i.e. consonants that end a CVC syllable). Below, the consonant inventory is introduced, and the distributional differences between coda (C2) and onset (C1) consonants are described.\n\nMedumba has 42 consonants, of which 18 are simplex consonants and 24 are complex consonants.\n\nTable 5 gives the inventory of the 18 simplex consonants (Voorhoeve 1965); they are displayed according to place of articulation (labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, glottal), and manner of articulation (nasal stop, oral stop, fricative). There are 4 nasals [m, n], ɲ, ŋ], 4 voiced stops [b, d, j, g], 4 voiceless stops [t, c, k, ʔ]), and 2 voiced fricatives (v, z) and 3 voiceless fricatives (f, s, ʃ). Dashes (--) indicate gaps in the consonant inventory.\nNote the absence of the following segments:\n\nTable 6 gives the inventory of the 24 complex consonants found in Medumba (Voorhoeve 1965:326, section 3.1.9); they are displayed according to the primary place of articulation (labial, alveolar, palatal and velar) and the nature of the secondary articulation (labialized, pre-nasalized, and pre-nasalized labialized). This includes 8 labialized consonants (Cᵂ), 10 pre-nasalized consonants (ᴺC), and 6 pre-nasalized labialized stops (ᴺCᵂ). Complex consonants only occur in onset position; see the next section for exemplification.\n\nNote the following gaps in the inventory of complex consonants:\n\nOf the 40 consonants found in Medumba, only 7 can be coda consonants: the 3 nasal stops /m, n, ŋ/, the 3 counterpart voiced oral stops /b, d, ɡ/, and the glottal stop /ʔ/. See Table 7 for the list of coda consonants, ordered according to place of articulation (labial, alveolar, velar, glottal), and manner of articulation (nasal stop, oral stop). (16-18) present examples of nasals in coda posit. (19-22) present examples of oral stops in coda position, which display allophonic variation conditioned by the right-edge context.\nFinal nasals include bilabial /m/, alveolar /n/, and velar /ŋ/.\nFinal stops includes bilabial /b/ (with allophone [p]), alveolar /d/ (with allophone [l,t]), velar /g/ (with allophone [ʁ, k]), and glottal /ʔ/.\n\nTable 8 presents the inventory of onset consonants and their allophones. The only consonant excluded from onset position is the glottal stop /ʔ/. All other consonants occur in onset position, so there are 39 possible onset consonnants. In onset position, nasals may be plain (C) or labialized (Cᵂ). All other consonant types (voiced plosives, voiceless plosives, fricative) occur as plain (C), labialized (Cᵂ), pre-nasalized (ᴺC), or pre-nasalized and labialized (ᴺCᵂ). In addition, onset consonants display allophonic variation that is conditioned by the following vowel. Examples are given below, as follows:\nInitial labials include:\n\nInitial alveolars include:\nInitial palatals include:\n\"\"\n\nInitial velars include:\n\n\"\"\n\nConsonant-final words — which are generally CVC because of the size constraint that favours CV or CVC words —are often augmented by a final vowel. This process of vowel insertion happens in one of two contexts: (i) before a pause; (ii) at then end of a sentence. The quality of the inserted vowel is conditioned by the final consonant: if the final C is a glottal stop, then the inserted vowel is schwa; elsewhere, the inserted vowel is a copy of the stem vowel. Examples illustrating vowel insertion are given in xx-yy.\n\nConsonants in onset position surface with different variants. This consonant allophone, a form of consonant mutation, is conditioned by the following vowel. There are seven conditioning contexts, as follows:\nTable 9 lists these seven contexts, along with the set of segments and phonological class that they target, the effect that they have, and the allophonic alternation that they condition.\n\nMedumba is famous for the extent to which tone shapes grammar. Although having only a two-tone contrast, namely High (H) and Low (L), surface tone melodies are conditioned by a variety of lexical, morphological and syntactic factors:\n\n\nMedumba is described as a two-level tone system with low (L) and high (H) tones; examples are given in Table 16. Observe that the L/H contrast is found with all Lexical (open) class categories; this includes verbs, nouns and prepositions. Likewise, Functional (closed-class) categories show an L/H contrasts; this includes verbal F-categories (C, T, and Aspect) and nominal F-categories (Dem, Det, Pl). [Describe examples; also give minimal pairs]\n\nVerb stems come in two shapes, CV and CVC, with each one contrasting Low and High tone. See (1-5) for examples of High/Low tone contrast with CV stems, and (6-6) for examples of High/Low tone contrast with CVC stems.\n\nIn principle, given the possibility of a stem bearing associated with one of four tone melodies — namely L(L), L(H), H(L) and H(H) for nouns and L or H for verbs — one expects to find a four-way tone contrast for a given segmental base (either CV or CVC). No such examples are attested within a given word-class, but there is one instance elf a 4-way contrast across word-classes. In addition, there are a few three-way contrasts for a given noun base, and numerous many four-way tone contrasts with the same base, if one looks at tone melodies across word-classes.\nExamples are given in (1-3).\n\n (5) Low-tone (a) mbàŋ (6) High-tone mʙə́ \n\n (7) Low-tone (a) ndà (8) High-tone mbʉ \n\n (9) Low-tone (a) s-ə̂n (10) High-tone N yə́n \n\n (11) Low-tone (a) bà N (12) High-tone ba N \n\nIn addition to level high and low tones, Medumba exhibits falling (HL) and rising (LH) contour tones. These contour tones are morphologically derived from floating H tones that occur as affixes preceding or following the stems they associate with. These floating tones make themselves known by docking to tone-bearing units (TBUs) associated with L-tone, thus forming a tone contour. [DESCRIBE EXAMPLES; add LH examples] \n\nMedumba shows downstep, where H is produced at a lower pitch than an immediately preceding H tone; downstep is represented as (ꜜ). Downstep is viewed as resulting from a floating Low tone that shifts the pitch level of a following High tone one step lower than the preceding High tone. Downstep is syntactically conditioned in that it occurs at phrasal boundaries:\n[GIVE EXAMPLES]\n\nMedumba has several affixes including:\n\nTone on Nouns: {LL, HH, HL, LH}: Voorhoeve introduced a non-segment tone in order to distinguish two different low tone noun groups and two different high tone noun groups. For instance, naʔ and mfən both bear a segment low tone, but their tonal realization is different in the context such as \"mə jən mfən ___\". For instance, naʔ in \"mə jən mfən naʔ (I saw the child of the cow)\" bears a non-low tone, whereas mfen in \"mə jən mfən\" mfən \"(I saw the child of the chief)\" bears a low tone. He proposed a four-way distinction, L(L), L(H), H(L), and H(H) to account for the nominal tone groups (Voorhoeve 1971:44-53). Examples are given in Table 10. \nTone on Verbs: {L, H}: The radical of the verb has only one tonal contrast, which is a Low and High contrast. The tone of radical may be realized differently in different contexts. For instance, a low tone verb that has a nasal prefix has a different tone from its non-prenasalized counterpart. Examples are provided to illustrate this phenomenon. [Give examples of CV, CVC, CV-L and CVC-L)\n\nThe examples above show that the Low tone radical is realized as a high tone if the verb is prenasalized, whereas it is realized as a low-mid tone if the verb is not prenasalized. The High tone radical is realized as mid tone regardless of prenasalization. This effect is also found in Bamileke-FeʔFeʔ.\n\nVoorhoeve identifies two characteristics of noun classes that surface in Medumba:\nVoorhoeve also assumes that pronominal prefixes exist within the noun class system, with these prefixes consisting of inherent tone morphemes such as the left-edge floating tone. The added prenominal tone creates a tonal difference between singular and plural noun class pairs, with generation of the plural form created by the singular.\n\nNoun classes can be detached by singular and plural pairs.\n\nVoorhoeve ascertains that the nasal prefix serves as a distinguishing factor between singular and plural noun pairs. As seen in Table 19, this nasal prefix does not surface in all constructions, especially with singular nouns that are already nasal word-initially. \n\nOther noun classes in Medumba, however, exhibit derivation from Proto-Bantu noun classes, which had a strict parallel between singular and plural classes. In comparing agreement systems of Bamileke languages, Medumba behaves independently from the expected system. Compared to Proto-Bantu noun classes, there seems to be a noun class merger in Medumba. This merger occurs through the compression of various Proto-Bantu noun classes into a generalized noun class in Medumba. This can be seen in Table 13.\nProto-Bantu noun classes typically assign particular words to certain noun classes, but this is not exhibited in Medumba. This would imply the dissolution of strict noun classes like the ones found in Proto-Bantu, as the set noun classes are merging into one class, albeit still maintaining a noun class-like form. The flexibility of noun classes in Medumba could be correlated with inflectional morphemes acting as the noun class system, with these morphemes surfacing as left-edge floating tones.\n\nLoan words are normally inserted into unrestricted noun classes. /látrí/, the loan word for \"light\" from English, can either be viewed as a mass noun or not, depending on the speaker. In the case of Medumba, this allows for any noun class to take a loan word.\n\nIn looking at interspeaker variation on the addition of loan words in Medumba noun classes, the instability of a formal noun class allows flexibility with speakers of various dialects This could be due to disagreement on how to lexicalize a new loan word between the various dialects. One such example is the loan word for \"light\", /látrí/. While one speaker chose to pluralize /látrí/ as /ndátrí/, the other speaker refused to pluralize /látrí/ as they believed it was a mass noun.\n\nYounger speakers of Medumba are beginning to use forms of words that do not account for noun class, such as the first person possessive form /jɔm/. The first person possessive form normally varies depending on the noun it is possessing, such as in /látrí -ɔm/ (my light) or /ndátrí -t͡ʃɔm/ (my lights). It is unknown as to how much younger speakers know about noun classes and agreement.\n\nBamileke distinguishes four sets of personal pronouns: simplex, possessive, complex, and reciprocal.\n\nSimplex pronouns are differentiated according to syntactic position: \n\nAlmost all plural pronouns often begin with \"b\"-, which is a marker of plurality; see Table 15. The only exception to this is the 2pl pronoun \"jin\", which is the elsewhere form (i.e. it is used with indirect objects, objects of prepositions, and for topicalization and focalization).\nThe tone simplex pronouns depends on the following verb or auxiliary (for subject pronouns) or the preceding verb (for object pronouns). Examples of tone variation of pronoun in subject position (provide fuller description and edit examples). Example (1) illustrates 1st \"me;\" 2sg \"u\", 3sg o, and 3pl \"bu\" also behave as in (1). Example (2) illustrate 1pl \"bag\"; 2pl \"bin\" also behaves as in (2). [give orthography and IPA]\n\nExamples of tone variation of pronoun in object position ((provide fuller description, edit examples put both IPA and orthography). Example (3) illustrates 1sg \"am\"; example (4) illustrates 1pl \"jag\"(\"e\"). [give orthography and IPA\n\nThe tonal structure of possessive pronouns depends on the tonal structure of the preceding noun. \n\nProvide examples (see Voorhoeve 1967:426); use template from subject and object pronouns above.\n\nComplex plural pronouns specify the composition of the group of participants denoted by the pronoun. [Provide fuller description; give examples form Voorhoever 1967:428); regularize IPA transcription]\n\n[Provide description]\n\nMedumba has a rich inventory of temporal and aspectual auxiliaries, and makes productive use of serial verb constructions. [Give examples]\n\nMedumba has finely articulated temporal contrasts, with up to 9 distinct past tense auxiliaries, and 5 distinct future tense auxiliaries.\n\nMedumba makes use of numerous clause-typing particles that occur at the beginning or end of the sentence: they are used to mark yes/no questions, content questions, relative clauses, as well as embedded clauses. In addition, there are two forms of negation, according to whether negation has scope over VP or CP: VP-scope negation is contrastive (e.g. He bought some books, but he did not sell pens); CP-scope negation denies the truth of a proposition \"p\" (e.g. NOT-p = it is not the case that \"p\"). [Give examples]\n\nAssociative noun constructions, which usually translated as 'Noun of Noun', as in \"bǎm\" \"mɛ́n\" (‘belly of the child’), are analyzed with a floating tone interposed between the two nouns. The presence of this floating tone is reflected by the tone melodies borne by the nouns that precede or follow it. This associative tone, first hypothesized by Jan Voorhoeve, may be high or low depending on the class and tone pattern of the preceding noun. The tone may lower the pitch-level of Noun (a phenomenon called down step); or it may combine with the final vowel of Noun, resulting in a (rising LH or falling HL) contour tone.\n\nFor example, in (1), the first line represents the theorized underlying tonal melody of the two nouns, with the L tone associative marker in bold. The second line shows the two tones which are actually pronounced at the surface, with the pitch level shown in brackets (a very low pitch followed by a mid-range pitch). Likewise in (2), the first line shows the theoretical tonal melody of what at the surface are pronounced as a LH contour on Noun and a down-stepped high tone on Noun. Thus, in brackets we see a slash indicating a rise from low to high pitch, and a mid-level line indicating a mid-range pitch.\n\nExamples (3) to (6) illustrate the realization of the associative in contexts where Noun is L-tone and Noun is H-tone. Whether or not Noun is theorized to be followed by a floating L or H tone has no effect on the surface form (i.e., the difference between (3) and (5), and (4) and (6)). What does have an effect is the tone of the associative marker—in (3) and (5) it is H, while in (4) and (6) it is L, resulting in an LH contour on Noun.\n\nThe effect that the associative tone has on either of the two nouns may be dependent on which floating tones accompany those nouns, which in turn is decided by their noun class. Examples (7) to (10) illustrate the realization of the associative in contexts where Noun is H-tone and Noun is H-tone. As with (3) to (6), in examples (7) and (9) we can see that the floating tone following the noun has no effect on the surface form—if the associative marker is H, then the surface form will always be two level H tones, or else an HL contour followed by an H tone, varying by speaker or dialect. In the case of (8) and (10), the floating tone which follows the noun does have a perceptible effect. In (8), the surface form is either an H tone followed by an L tone, or else an HL contour followed by a L tone (again, varying by speaker or dialect). However, in (10) the only available choice is a H tone followed by down-stepped H, demonstrating that the theorized underlying tones do have an effect on the pitch at which tones are actually pronounced.\n\nMedumba demonstratives (the equivalent of English \"this\" or \"that\") include three elements:\nThe normal (unmarked) order or demondtratives is postnominal, yieding [Noun-Dem-Loc]. Divergence from this canonical order is possible, so that [Dem-N-Loc] is also attested, and yields a contrastive focus reading, where the noun is contrasted with other deictic alternatives (\"this\" man, as opposed to that man).\nWithin the DP, there are 8 possible word order variations, taking into account the order of nouns, adjectives, demonstratives, and numerals. These are divided by Kouankem (2011) into post-nominal and pre-nominal variations. The possible word orders are (where N = noun; A = adjective; Dem = demonstrative; and Num = number):\n\nThere are three kinds of adjective classes in Medumba, which differ in their order relative to the noun they modify. [GIVE EXAMPLES] \n\nThere are a limited number of pure adjectives. These are further divided into two classes. Class 1 pure adjectives always appear before their noun. Class 2 pure adjectives typically appear after the noun, but can appear before the noun in a contrastive context. [GIVE EXAMPLES]\n\n[GIVE EXAMPLES]\n\n[GIVE EXAMPLES]\n\nMedumba has four locative prepositions: \"mbàŋ\" (next to), \"mʙəә́\" (in front of), \"ɲàm\" (behind), and \"nùm\" (on).\n\nWhile there are several strategies for forming prepositional phrases involving overt prepositions or “locative specifications”, there are no overt locative prefixes which correspond to the Bantu locative classes (16), (17), and (18) (pa-, ku-, and mu- respectively). However, there is a <nowiki>\"covert\"</nowiki> prefix in the form of a floating H tone whose presence may be detected in certain contexts by its effects on the pitch of surrounding tones, which Voorhoeve hypothesizes that it may be the remnant of those locative classes. The interpretation of a noun marked with this tone is variable and context dependent, generally corresponding to prepositions like on, at, or in.

He was an active member of the Iranian Writers Association, a group that had been long banned in Iran due to their objection to censorship and encouraged freedom of expression. Due to his activism, he was most likely murdered during the Chain murders of Iran in December 1998.\n\nMohammad Mokhtari was born in Mashhad. He graduated from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 1969, majoring in Persian Language and Literature. He married in 1972 and had two sons.\n\nIn 1973, Mokhtari joined the literary foundation of Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh and soon became a member of its scientific committee. From 1979 until the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Mokhtari taught at the School of Dramatic Arts (today’s School of Cinema and Theatre) of University of Tehran.\n\nIn 1981, he was the secretary of the Iranian Writers’ Association for one year. He was arrested in 1982 for political reasons and imprisoned for two years and at this time he was also permanently banned from working for the Iranian government. From 1986, he was on the editorial board of the Donya-ye Sokhan magazine. He also had close ties with other publications such as Takapu. Mokhtari played a key role in the re-opening of the Iranian Writers’ Association. He was a long-time member of the Association and a central figure in the Third Iranian Writers’ Association. According to friends and acquaintances, he worked eagerly for the achievement of the goals of the Association, and followed its projects with patience and perseverance; his constructive and helpful criticism proved vital for the Association (Asr-e No). He also played a crucial part in the writing and publication of a letter, dated October 15, 1994, in which 134 writers stated their objection to censorship and restraints on the freedom of expression. Mokhtari was a successful researcher and respected poet and he had published several books of poetry, as well as a book on mythology.\n\nOn December 3, 1998, Mr. Mokhtari left his house for shopping and never returned. The next day, police officers of Aminabad found an unidentified body in an uninhabited area of Aminabad, on the estate of a cement factory, near the road to Firuzabad (near Tehran City). There was nothing to help identify the body, other than a pen and a piece of paper. The body was transferred to the police station’s forensic team. On December 10 (the International Human Rights Day), one week after his disappearance, the body was identified at the morgue and his family remarked that there appeared to be bruising around his neck.\n\nHe died on December 3, 1998 of suffocation. His death came only a few days after the death of Iranian political activists, Parvaneh Eskandari Forouhar and her husband, Dariush Forouhar and the assassination of writer Mohammad-Ja'far Pouyandeh. The Iranian Ministry of Intelligence later denied responsibility for the Mokhtari death and claimed a \"foreign network\" may have assassinated him.\n\n\n"}

A contributor to several Indian newspapers and literary magazines, several volumes of his essays have also been collated and published, the most notable ones being Agrahaarathil Periyar (அக்கிரகாரத்தில் பெரியார்) and Thirumbichendra Tharunam (திரும்பிச் சென்ற தருணம்).He is one of the Advisories in awards panel of Tamil literary garden organization. \n\nKrishnan presently lives with his wife Revathi in New Delhi and their only son Siddharth works in Google in California.\n\nThe Tiger Claw Tree follows the vicissitudes of a Tenkalai Iyengar family in South India. At its center is the matriarch Ponna who is taking her last stand both against death and her failing memory. Her confused memories about long forgotten family anecdotes are both family history and impetus for events in the personal history of her children grandchildren and great grand children. The last of these are Kannan and Nambi who bring the story into the latter half of the last century and whose personal tragedies are set against the larger canvas of regional and national histories. Although an engaging family saga it rises above that genre by exploring the validity of ideas and their personal betrayal against the tragic backdrop of the nightmare that is History.\nThe title is drawn from a A.K.Ramanujan translation of a famous Sangam poem from the anthology Ainkurunuru (Poem 142). Author adds a pithy coda to this little gem of a poem : \"Each person has a tree within himself, to some the birds may not come at all. \n\nKrishnan's second novel Muddy River drops the grand raconteurial ambition of narrating stories spanning a century and Instead chooses to focus on one man's story against the backdrop of Indian bureaucracy and modern day politics. Drawn largely from his personal experience as an Executive Director of Vigilance in a public sector company, the novel follows Ramesh Chandran in his quest to rescue a kidnapped Engineer from the hands of Assamese Militants. The novel adopts a more complicated narrative strategy than Tiger Claw as it tracks in parallel the authorial ambitions of Ramesh Chandran as he attempts to weave his own life story that is part adventure, part bureaucratic nightmare and part personal tragedy into a complex novel. Self-referential and ambitious Muddy river attempts to blur the lines between fiction and reality, between narrator and the narration in the hope that these erasures will bring forth a more meaningful reality for its present and future readers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2830226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2830226", "title": "Philippine Hokkien", "text": "Philippine Hokkien\n\nPhilippine Hokkien (), is the variant of Hokkien as spoken by about 98.7% of the ethnic Chinese population of the Philippines. A mixed version that involves this language with Tagalog and English is Hokaglish.\n\nThe term \"Philippine Hokkien\" is used when differentiating the variety of Hokkien spoken in the Philippines from those spoken in Taiwan, China, and other Southeast Asian countries.\n\nThere are various terms that native to the speaker itself used:\n\nIn the Philippines, all terms are used interchangeably to refer to Philippine Hokkien.\n\nPhilippine Hokkien is generally similar to the Hokkien dialect spoken in Jinjiang and Quanzhou, however, the Hokkien dialect spoken in Xiamen, also known as \"Amoy\" (), is considered the standard and prestigious form of Hokkien. Minor differences with other Hokkien dialects in Taiwan, China, or throughout Southeast Asia only occur in terms of vocabulary.\n\nHokkien is spoken by ethnic Chinese throughout the Philippines. Major metropolitan areas that have a significant number of Chinese include Metro Manila, Metro Cebu and Metro Davao. Other cities which also substantial Chinese populations in Angeles City, Bacolod City, Cagayan de Oro, Dagupan City, Dumaguete City, Ilagan, Iloilo City, Legaspi, Naga City, Tacloban City, Vigan and Zamboanga City.\n\nOnly 12.2% of all ethnic Chinese have a varieties of Chinese as their mother tongue. Nevertheless, the vast majority (77%) still retain the ability to understand and speak Hokkien as a second or third language.\n\nPrior to the emergence of China as a regional power in the late 1990s, speaking Hokkien, Mandarin, Cantonese and other Chinese varieties was seen as old-fashioned and awkward, with the younger generation of Chinese Filipinos opting to use either English, Filipino or various other regional languages as their first languages.\n\nRecent developments showing the rise of a politically and economically stronger China eventually led to the newly found elegance and style now associated with speaking Hokkien and other Chinese varieties. Hence, there is a stronger clamour for instructors who can produce students fluent in Hokkien and Mandarin. Many young parents are also shifting to using Hokkien at home as their children's first language.\n\nAround 120 Chinese Filipino educational institutions exist throughout the Philippines, with the vast majority being concentrated in Metro Manila. These schools primarily differ from others in the Philippines with the presence of Chinese-language subjects.\n\nThese schools were previously under direct supervision of the Republic of China (Taiwan) Ministry of Education until 1976 when \"Presidential Decree 176 of 1973\" (sometimes called the \"Filipinization\" decree) of former President Ferdinand Marcos placed all foreign schools under the authority of the Department of Education. The decree effectively halved the time allotted for Chinese subjects, while Tagalog became a required subject, and the medium of instruction shifted from Mandarin Chinese to English.\n\nChinese Filipino primary and secondary schools typically feature Chinese subjects added to the standard curriculum prescribed by the Department of Education. The three core Chinese subjects are Chinese Grammar (), Chinese Composition (), and Chinese Mathematics (). Other schools may offer additional subjects such as Chinese calligraphy (), history, geography, and culture, all integrated in all the three core Chinese subjects in accordance with PD № 176. All Chinese subjects are taught in Mandarin Chinese, and in some schools, students are prohibited from speaking English, Filipino, or even Hokkien during these classes.\n\nPresently, the Ateneo de Manila University, under their Chinese Studies Programme offers Hokkien 1 (Chn 8) and Hokkien 2 (Chn 9) as electives.\n\nOn the other hand, Chiang Kai Shek College offers Fookien Classes in their CKS College Language Center.\n\nPhilippine Hokkien developed during successive centuries of the Chinese Filipinos being in the Philippines.\n\nStarting from the early 19th century, Chinese migrants from Fujian province, specifically from Quanzhou eventually eclipsed those from Guangdong province, establishing Hokkien as the primary variety of Chinese spoken in the Philippines.\n\nAs ethnic Chinese began to associate with Filipinos and learn Tagalog and English, they began to use native terms used to refer to items that are found only in the Philippine milieu. Also, since most Chinese migrants from Fujian are businessmen and merchants, many have been using colloquialisms and slang words, rather than grammatically correct scholarly jargon. Both result to the current preponderance of English, Tagalog, and Fujian colloquialisms in Philippine Hokkien.\n\nIn some situations, Philippine Hokkien is written in the Latin alphabet. The Chinese Congress on World Evangelization –Philippines, an international organization of Overseas Chinese Christian churches, use a romanization system based predominantly on the Pe̍h-ōe-jī (POJ) system. The origins of this system and its extensive use in the Christian community have led to it being known by some modern writers as \"Church Romanization\" (Kàu-hōe Lô-má-jī; 教會羅馬字); often abbreviated to \"Kàu-lô\" (教羅). There is some debate on whether \"Pe̍h-ōe-jī\" or \"Church Romanization\" is the more appropriate name. During the 19th century, Pe̍h-ōe-jī was used extensively in Chinese Filipino churches and as a result, many Chinese Filipinos were literate in this system. Since 2006, the Taiwanese Romanization System also known as \"Tâi-lô\", which is derived from Pe̍h-ōe-jī has been officially promoted by Taiwan's Ministry of Education. Due to the extensive Taiwanese influence on Chinese education in the Philippines such as the use of Taiwanese textbooks and materials which contain traditional Chinese characters, Chinese Filipinos and ethnic Filipinos alike who formally study the language nowadays may use a version of Tâi-lô.\n\nIn general, Min Nan has 7 to 9 tones, and tone sandhi is extensive. There are minor variations between the Quanzhou and Zhangzhou tone systems. Taiwanese tones follow the schemes of Amoy or Quanzhou, depending on the area of Taiwan. Both Amoy and Taiwanese Min Nan typically has 7 tones; the 9th tone is used only in special or foreign loan words. Quanzhou is the only Min Nan dialect with 8 tones, of which the 6th tone is present. The Philippine Min Nan dialect follows the 8 tones and tone sandhi of Quanzhou because many of the Chinese Filipino who speak Min Nan in the Philippines have ancestors from Quanzhou (Fujian) in China.\n\nPhilippine Hokkien is largely derived from the Hokkien dialect spoken in Quanzhou. However, it gradually absorbed influences from both Standard Amoy and Zhangzhou variants.\n\nAlthough Philippine Hokkien is generally mutually comprehensible with any Hokkien variant, including Taiwanese Hokkien, the numerous English and Filipino loanwords as well as the extensive use of colloquialisms (even those which are now unused in China) can result in confusion among Hokkien speakers from outside of the Philippines. In Cebu and Dumaguete for example, instead of Tagalog, Cebuano words are incorporated. In Iloilo and Bacolod, Hiligaynon words are incorporated. While in Central Luzon, Kapampangan and Pangasinan words are incorporated.\n\nMost speakers of Philippine Hokkien have their origins in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, hence the influence of the Hokkien variants spoken in these areas.\n\nSince the Standard Xiamen (Amoy) variant is considered the most prestigious variant of Hokkien and is the spoken variant of the educated residents of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, elements of this variant occasionally seep into Philippine Hokkien, such as the following:\n\nPhilippine Hokkien (as well as Southeast Asian Hokkien) uses a disproportionately large amount of colloquial words as compared to the Hokkien variants used in China and Taiwan. Many of the colloquialisms are themselves considered dated (specifically, pre-World War II) in China but are still in use among Hokkien-speaking Chinese Filipinos.\n\n\nPhilippine Hokkien, like other Southeast Asian variants of Hokkien (e.g. Singaporean Hokkien, Penang Hokkien, Johor Hokkien and Medan Hokkien) absorbed several indigenous and English words and phrases which are usually only found (or are more important) in its new milieu. These \"borrowed\" words are never used in written Hokkien, for which Mandarin characters are used.\n\n\n"}

If those things were to change or dissipate the couple may remain romantically linked but often the collar will be removed.\n\nFor the submissive in such a relationship, the collar is seen as a status symbol signifying the approval and acknowledgement of a person they wish to serve.

{"id": "19177067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19177067", "title": "Tikopia language", "text": "Tikopia language\n\nThe Tikopia language is a Polynesian Outlier language from the island of Tikopia in the Solomon Islands. It is closely related to the Anuta language of the neighboring island of Anuta. Tikopian is also spoken by the Polynesian minority on Vanikoro, who long ago migrated from Tikopia.\n\nBecause of its remote and isolated location, Tikopia had few contacts with outside groups until well into the twentieth century. Tikopians\noccasionally visited other islands, but these trips were limited by the large distances and great hazards involved in canoe ocean voyages. Contacts by Westerners began sporadically around the beginning of the nineteenth century, but in 1927, when Firth did his initial fieldwork in Tikopia, the indigenous culture was largely intact. The major contact agents were, first, missionaries and, later, labor recruiters. By the 1950s, all the Tikopians had become Christianized, and most of the native ritual practices had ceased. Much of the Tikopian life style has remained intact, but the forces of Westernization have been making inroads throughout the twentieth century (Lagace, 1974).\n\nTikopia is a small remote volcanic island that has a population of 1,200 people. It is the southwest of the Solomon Islands. There are about seventy-five different languages that are spoken on the Solomon Islands. Out of these languages seventy-one are living and four are extinct. Out of the living languages five are institutional, twenty-four are developing, twenty-six are vigorous, eight are in trouble, and eight are dying. Linguists refer this language as a Samoic or a Polynesian Outlier language. Polynesian Outlier languages are a number of Polynesian societies that lie outside the main region of the Polynesian Triangle. Some linguists also believe that Tikopia and Anuta are the dialects of the same language. There are approximately 3320 speakers that speak the Tikopian language. The Tikopian language, Tikopia-Anuta, is part of the Austronesian language family (Firth, 1985).\n\nThere are twelve consonant phonemes that this language uses. They use the letters /f, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, ng/ and the glottal stop (Firth, 1985). There have been debates from different linguists on whether or not Tikopia uses l or r. Elbert claims that Tikopia is a language that uses l but not r and he strongly believes this because he believed Tikopia was a colony of Samoa. Raymond Firth said, “Dumont DʻUrville published a small dictionary in 1834 where 235 words were collected.” R was the most dominant in that dictionary because it appeared in 50 words while l appeared in only 15. The language changed in over a century and modernly more words are used with l. Raymond Firths own work shows that both l and r phonemes are used. Not too many words use the letter l and are actually rarely heard in native speakers (Firth, 1963).\n\nThe vowel phonemes of this language are basic. They use /a, e, i, o, u/. The vowel length is similar to the consonant lengths. Linguists do not interpret long vowels in writing so they use shortcuts like macrons (a line over the vowel indicating a longer length), but in Tikopia writing they use two identical juxtaposed vowels. According to the Tikopia dictionary, “This has typographical simplicity, but may present a problem of interpretation as to where long vowel and rearticulation actually occur.\n\nThe basic word order in Tikopia is Subject-Verb-Object, but sometimes they use the Verb-Subject-Object Typology (Firth, 1985).\n\nTikopia uses partial reduplication and it usually intensifies a verb to make it plural (Firth, 1985). The suffix “nofo” is added to a verb and it makes the verb that is being acted upon by a subject plural, so it is acted upon by subjects.\n\nThroughout the history of the Tikopian language they made contact with the outside world. During these times, there is a high chance that many words from other languages were borrowed and used in the language known as “loanwords”. Some of these words are known as native to Tikopia, but the main sources of the borrowing words are from Anuta, Mota, Hawaiian, and most definitely English.\nWords derived from English:\n\nMost of the recorded documents on this language come from the linguist Raymond Firth. Tikopia did not have much documented until the twentieth century where Firth spent three trips to Tikopia. In 1928 Firth spent a whole year on his first time to Tikopia; he revisited in 1952 for five more months and again in 1966. Only one person had recorded documents before Firth in 1910, Reverend W. J. Durrad, and he stayed for a duration of 2 months. With this valuable documentation, Raymond Firth was able to create a dictionary for the Tikopian language, Taranga Fakatikopia Ma Taranga Fakainglisi. They also have a bible, limited YouTube videos and some song books.\n\nTikopia is spoken throughout the Solomon Islands and is very well documented. Raymond Firth spent a lot of his time making sure that Tikopia did not fall close to being extinct. He created the dictionary with all his information and it was highly useful. With his help Tikopia is nowhere near being extinct, therefore, according to ethnologue, Tikiopia is categorized as a developing language.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11220596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11220596", "title": "Touron", "text": "Touron\n\nTouron is a derogatory term combining the words \"Tourist\" with \"Moron\" to describe any person who, while on vacation, commits an act of pure stupidity. The term is considered park ranger slang that describes how some tourists act when entering a national park. The phrase indicates an act of ignorance and is known to be used in different subcultures. It is also used to describe tourists in general when they are outside their normal \"comfort zone\".\n\nEarly mentions are \"\"touron n. A tourist, usually an annoying one. —\"Say wha?\", The Washington Post, September 20, 1987\". In 1991 the term was cited in: \"Over at U.S. 192 and State Road 535, westbound touron — (a combo of tourists and morons, according to a local dj) are constantly making sudden U-turns from the left lane, causing oodles of rear-end wrecks. —\"The Road Toad,\" Orlando Sentinel, September 29, 1991\"\". The National Park Service constantly warns park guests about the dangers of wildlife and the natural surroundings. Images and video of tourist in dangerous situations are uploaded to the internet and demonstrate their, often stunning, behavior. Tourists acting as \"Tourons\" can drive erratically. A common occurrence is to see vehicles stopped in the middle of the road at the very first sighting of deer. Drivers and occupants leave the vehicle to take pictures, backing traffic up for miles. The term is used as humor to defend against the usual aggravation of continued exposure to tourists by even local residents of tourist areas.\n\nIt has been argued that everyone is a \"touron\" outside their own home and away from familiar surroundings. Just being a traveler in a foreign location could make one a touron. Author Kelsey Timmerman believes that: \"A touron is one part eager tourist and one part well-meaning moron. You yourself have likely been a touron at one time or another.\" Tourists become touronic out of an innocent reaction to places they have never been due to a greater curiosity.\n\n"}
