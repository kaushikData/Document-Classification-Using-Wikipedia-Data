It is spoken mostly by the Abkhaz people. It is one of the official languages of Abkhazia, where around 100,000 people speak it. Furthermore, it is spoken by thousands of members of the Abkhazian diaspora in Turkey, Georgia's autonomous republic of Adjara, Syria, Jordan and several Western countries. The Russian census of 2010 reported 6,786 speakers of Abkhazian in Russia.\n\nAbkhaz is a Northwest Caucasian language and is therefore related to Adyghe. It is especially close to Abaza, and they are sometimes considered dialects of the same language, Abazgi, of which the literary dialects of Abkhaz and Abaza are simply two ends of a dialect continuum. Grammatically, the two are very similar; however, the differences in phonology are substantial and are the main reason for many other linguists preferring to keep the two separate. Most linguists (instance, Chirikba 2003) believe that Ubykh is the closest relative to the Abkhaz–Abaza dialect continuum.\n\nAbkhaz is spoken primarily in Abkhazia. Abkhaz is also spoken by members of the large Abkhaz Muhajir diaspora, mainly located in Turkey, with smaller groups living in Syria, Iraq, and Jordan; the Georgian autonomous republic of Adjara; throughout the former Soviet Union (e.g. Armenia and Ukraine); and – through more recent emigration – in Western countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States. However, the exact number of Abkhaz speakers in these countries remains unknown due to a lack of official records.\n\nThe earliest extant written records of the Abkhaz language are in the Arabic script, recorded by the Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi in the 17th century. Abkhaz has been used as a literary language for only about 100 years.\n\nAbkhaz is generally viewed as having three major dialects:\nThe literary language is based on the Abzhywa dialect.\n\nAbkhaz has a very large number of consonants (58 in the literary dialect), with three-way voiced/voiceless/ejective and palatalized/labialized/plain distinctions. By contrast, the language has only two phonemically distinct vowels—which, however, have several allophones depending on the palatal and/or labial quality of adjacent consonants.\n\nPhonemes in green are found in the Bzyp and Sadz dialects of Abkhaz, but not in Abzhywa; phonemes in blue are unique to the Bzyp dialect.\n\nAbkhaz is typologically classified as a polysynthetic and agglutinative language. Like all other Northwest Caucasian languages, Abkhaz has an extremely complex verbal system coupled with a very simple noun system. Viacheslav Chirikba has characterized Abkhaz as a \"verbcentric language\", as the verb occupies the central place in Abkhaz morphology.\n\nAbkhaz is an ergative–absolutive language that distinguishes just two cases, the instrumental and the adverbial.\n\nAbkhaz has used the Cyrillic script since 1862. The first alphabet was a 37-character Cyrillic alphabet invented by Baron Peter von Uslar. In 1909 a 55-letter Cyrillic alphabet was used. A 75-letter Latin script devised by a Russian/Georgian linguist Nikolai Marr lasted for 2 years 1926–1928 (during the Latinization campaign). The Georgian script was adopted and used in 1938–54 years after was restored the initial Cyrillic alphabet designed in 1892 by Dmitry Gulia together with Konstantin Machavariani and modified in 1909 by Aleksey Chochua.\n\nBoth Georgian and Abkhaz law enshrines an official status of the Abkhaz language in Abkhazia.\n\nThe 1992 law of Georgia, reiterated in the 1995 constitution, grants Abkhaz the status of second official language in the territory of Abkhazia — along with Georgian.\n\nIn November 2007, the de facto authorities of Abkhazia adopted a new law \"on the state language of the Republic of Abkhazia\" that mandates Abkhaz as the language of official communication. According to the law, all meetings held by the president, parliament, and government must be conducted in Abkhaz (instead of Russian, which is currently a de facto administrative language) from 2010, and all state officials will be obliged to use Abkhaz as their language of everyday business from 2015. Some, however, have considered the implementation of this law unrealistic and concerns have been made that it will drive people away from Abkhazia and hurt the independent press due to a significant share of non-Abkhaz speakers among ethnic minorities as well as Abkhaz themselves, and a shortage of teachers of Abkhaz. The law is an attempt to amend a situation where up to a third of the ethnic Abkhaz population are no longer capable of speaking their ethnic language, and even more are unable to read or write it; instead, Russian is the language most commonly used in public life at present.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is conventionally used as a derogatory term for a person who regards himself as an expert on military matters, despite having little to no actual experience in the military. Alternatively, it can mean a military commander who doesn't participate in actual combat.\n\nThe most common usage of the term refers to \"[a] person without military experience who regards himself as an expert military strategist.\"\n\nThis person may be a civilian whose only exposure to the military or military history is through academic or self-study, or a former member of the military, who was of low rank and/or has no experience with planning or strategic decision-making. In both cases, these individuals claim to be more capable of analyzing combat conditions and making strategic judgments than past military commanders who have been responsible for such analysis and decisions (\"see also\" Armchair theorizing\").\n\nIn 1967, \"New York Times\" correspondent Max Frankel wrote, \"In most wars, the armchairs are full of generals re-fighting every battle.\"\n\nThe term is also used to describe \"a military commander who is not actively involved in warfare, or who directs troops from a position of comfort or safety.\" These officers' duties are described by the media and the rest of the military as more bureaucratic than functional, and who have little to no experience in combat or warfare, yet hold a great degree of authority over soldiers or commanders who do.\n\nThe term is not exclusively applied to officers of command rank (such as generals or Admirals); it is also a popular term among enlisted personnel and the media to describe high-ranking officers whose rank affords them superior privileges, especially when they have attained rank through higher education, or the influence of their families, rather than combat duty.\n\n\n\n"}

The tablets invoke the intercession of the goddess Sulis Minerva in the return of stolen goods and to curse the perpetrators of the thefts. Inscribed mostly in British Latin, they have been used to attest to the everyday spoken vernacular of the Romano-British population of the second to fourth centuries A.D.\n\nThe Roman baths and temple dedicated to the goddess Sulis Minerva in the English city of Bath (founded by the Romans as \"Aquae Sulis\") were excavated between 1978 and 1983 by a team led by Barry Cunliffe and Peter Davenport. In 1979/1980, around 130 tablets were discovered in an excavation of the \"Sacred Spring\" under the King's Bath. The spring had been temporarily diverted to facilitate the excavation, revealing a huge array of Roman era items including the tablets.\n\nThe tablets, some in a fragmentary state, were small and rectangular and initially were assumed to be made of lead, although subsequent metallurgical analysis revealed that they are, in fact, made of lead alloyed with tin, with occasional traces of copper. Some of the tablets were cast under pressure into thin, flexible sheets with a finish as smooth as paper whereas others appear to have been roughly hammered out from a molten lump. Most of the tablets were inscribed, either with Roman capitals or with cursive script, but the expertise of the lettering varied. Some of the tablets had markings that appear to be an illiterate imitation of lettering, for example repetitive lines of crosses or sevens, and some were completely blank.\n\nThe tablets were put on display in the Roman Baths Museum in Bath, where they continue to be available to be viewed by the public. The inscriptions on the tablets were published in full in 1988 by historian Roger Tomlin.\n\nThe tablets were identified as “curse tablets” dating from the second to fourth centuries A.D. Curse tablets are small metal sheets inscribed with curses against specific people and were used in popular magic throughout the Roman world. \n\nMost of the inscriptions are in colloquial Latin, and specifically in the Vulgar Latin of the Romano-British population, known as \"British Latin\". Two of the inscriptions are in a language which is not Latin, although they use Roman lettering, and may be in a British Celtic language. If this should be the case, they would be the only examples of a written ancient British Celtic language; however, there is not yet scholarly consensus on their decipherment.\n\nAll but one of the 130 Bath curse tablets concern the restitution of stolen goods and are a type of curse tablet known as \"prayers for justice\". The complained of thefts are generally of personal possessions from the baths such as jewellery, gemstones, money, household goods and especially clothing. Theft from public baths appears to have been a common problem as it was a well-known Roman literary stereotype and severe laws existed to punish the perpetrators. Most of the depositors of the tablets (the victims of the thefts) appear to have been from the lower social classes. \n\nThe inscriptions generally follow the same formula, suggesting it was taken from a handbook: the stolen property is declared as having been transferred to a deity so that the loss becomes the deity’s loss; the suspect is named and, in 21 cases, so is the victim; the victim then asks the deity to visit afflictions on the thief (including death) not as a punishment but to induce the thief to hand the stolen items back. The deity whose help was invoked is Sulis, and the tablets were deposited by the victims in the spring that was sacred to her.\n\nA typical example reads:\nThe formula \"whether man or woman or whether slave or free\" is typical, and the following example is unusual in two respects. Firstly it adds the words \"whether pagan or Christian\" and secondly the text was written in reversed lettering:\nMany name the suspected thieves:\nSome of the inscriptions are very specific in the afflictions requested and reveal the intensity of the victim's anger:\n\nOne of the suspected British Celtic inscriptions has been translated as:\nAn alternative translation of the above inscription is:\n\nThe Bath curse tablets are the most important record of Romano-British religion yet published. Curse tablets are of particular use in evidencing the Vulgar Latin of everyday speech, and, since their publication in 1988, the Bath inscriptions have been used as evidence of the nature of British Latin. Additionally, the contents of the inscriptions have been used as evidence of popular attitudes to crime and the system of justice.\n\n"}

{"id": "37895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37895", "title": "Collatz conjecture", "text": "Collatz conjecture\n\nThe Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer \"n\". Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of \"n\", the sequence will always reach 1.\n\nThe conjecture is named after Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate. It is also known as the 3\"n\" + 1 conjecture, the Ulam conjecture (after Stanisław Ulam), Kakutani's problem (after Shizuo Kakutani), the Thwaites conjecture (after Sir Bryan Thwaites), Hasse's algorithm (after Helmut Hasse), or the Syracuse problem; the sequence of numbers involved is referred to as the hailstone sequence or hailstone numbers (because the values are usually subject to multiple descents and ascents like hailstones in a cloud), or as wondrous numbers.\n\nPaul Erdős said about the Collatz conjecture: \"Mathematics may not be ready for such problems.\" He also offered $500 for its solution. Jeffrey Lagarias in 2010 claimed that based only on known information about this problem, \"this is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics.\"\n\nConsider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:\n\n\nIn modular arithmetic notation, define the function \"f\" as follows:\n\nNow form a sequence by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with any positive integer, and taking the result at each step as the input at the next.\n\nIn notation:\n\n(that is: formula_3 is the value of formula_4 applied to formula_5 recursively formula_6 times; formula_7).\n\nThe Collatz conjecture is: \"This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.\"\n\nThat smallest \"i\" such that \"a\" = 1 is called the total stopping time of \"n\". The conjecture asserts that every \"n\" has a well-defined total stopping time. If, for some \"n\", such an \"i\" doesn't exist, we say that \"n\" has infinite total stopping time and the conjecture is false.\n\nIf the conjecture is false, it can only be because there is some starting number which gives rise to a sequence that does not contain 1. Such a sequence might enter a repeating cycle that excludes 1, or increase without bound. No such sequence has been found.\n\nFor instance, starting with \"n\" = 12, one gets the sequence 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\n\n\"n\" = 19, for example, takes longer to reach 1: 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\nThe sequence for \"n\" = 27, listed and graphed below, takes 111 steps (41 steps through odd numbers, in large font), climbing to 9232 before descending to 1.\n\nNumbers with a total stopping time longer than that of any smaller starting value form a sequence beginning with:\n\nThe starting values whose maximum trajectory point is greater than that of any smaller starting value are as follows:\n\nNumber of steps for \"n\" to reach 1 are\n\nThe longest progression for any initial starting number\n\nNote: these numbers are the lowest ones with the indicated step count, but not\nnecessarily the only ones below the given limit. For instance, 9,780,657,631 has 1132 steps as well.\n\nThe powers of two converge to one quickly because formula_8 is halved formula_5 times to reach one, and is never increased.\n\nAny counterexample to the Collatz conjecture would have to consist either of an infinite divergent trajectory or a cycle different from the trivial (4; 2; 1) cycle. Thus, if one could prove that neither of these types of counterexample could exist, then all positive integers would have a trajectory that reaches the trivial cycle.\nSuch a strong result is not known, but certain types of cycles have been ruled out.\n\nThe type of a cycle may be defined with reference to the \"shortcut\" definition of the Collatz map, formula_10 for odd \"n\" and formula_11 for even \"n\". A \"cycle\" is a where formula_12, formula_13, and so on, up to formula_14 in a closed loop. For this shortcut definition, the only known cycle is (1; 2). Although 4 is part of the single known cycle for the original Collatz map, it is not part of the cycle for the shortcut map.\n\nA \"k\"-cycle is a cycle that can be partitioned into 2\"k\" contiguous subsequences: \"k\" increasing sequences of odd numbers alternating with \"k\" decreasing sequences of even numbers. For instance, if the cycle consists of a single increasing sequence of odd numbers followed by a decreasing sequence of even numbers, it is called a \"1-cycle\".\n\nSteiner (1977) proved that there is no 1-cycle other than the trivial (1;2). Simons (2004) used Steiner's method to prove that there is no 2-cycle. Simons & de Weger (2005) extended this proof up to 68-cycles: there is no \"k\"-cycle up to \"k\" = 68. Beyond 68, this method gives upper bounds for the elements in such a cycle: for example, if there is a 75-cycle, then at least one element of the cycle is less than 2385×2. Therefore, as exhaustive computer searches continue, larger cycles may be ruled out. To state the argument more intuitively: we need not look for cycles that have at most 68 trajectories, where each trajectory consists of consecutive ups followed by consecutive downs. See below for an idea of how one might find an upper bound for the elements of a cycle.\n\nAlthough the conjecture has not been proven, most mathematicians who have looked into the problem think the conjecture is true because experimental evidence and heuristic arguments support it.\n\n, the conjecture has been checked by computer for all starting values up to 87 * 2. All initial values tested so far eventually end in the repeating cycle (4; 2; 1), which has only three terms. From this lower bound on the starting value, a lower bound can also be obtained for the number of terms a repeating cycle other than (4; 2; 1) must have. When this relationship was established in 1981, the formula gave a lower bound of 35,400 terms.\n\nThis computer evidence is not a proof that the conjecture is true. As shown in the cases of the Pólya conjecture, the Mertens conjecture, and Skewes' number, sometimes a conjecture's only counterexamples are found when using very large numbers.\n\nIf one considers only the \"odd\" numbers in the sequence generated by the Collatz process, then each odd number is on average 3/4 of the previous one. (More precisely, the geometric mean of the ratios of outcomes is 3/4.) This yields a heuristic argument that every Hailstone sequence should decrease in the long run, although this is not evidence against other cycles, only against divergence. The argument is not a proof because it assumes that Hailstone sequences are assembled from uncorrelated probabilistic events. (It does rigorously establish that the 2-adic extension of the Collatz process has two division steps for every multiplication step for almost all 2-adic starting values.)\n\nAnd even if the probabilistic reasoning were rigorous, this would still imply only that the conjecture is almost surely true for any given integer, which does not necessarily imply that it is true for all integers.\n\nAlthough it is not known rigorously whether all positive numbers eventually reach one according to the Collatz iteration, it is known that many numbers do so. In particular, Krasikov and Lagarias showed that the number of integers in the interval [1,\"x\"] that eventually reach one is at least proportional to \"x\".\n\nThere is another approach to prove the conjecture, which considers the bottom-up\nmethod of growing the so-called \"Collatz graph\". The \"Collatz graph\" is a graph defined by the inverse relation\n\nSo, instead of proving that all positive integers eventually lead to 1, we can try to prove that 1 leads to all positive integers. For any integer \"n\", \"n\" ≡ 1 (mod 2) iff 3\"n\" + 1 ≡ 4 (mod 6). Equivalently, (\"n\" − 1)/3 ≡ 1 (mod 2) iff \"n\" ≡ 4 (mod 6). Conjecturally, this inverse relation forms a tree except for the 1–2–4 loop (the inverse of the 4–2–1 loop of the unaltered function \"f\" defined in the Statement of the problem section of this article).\n\nWhen the relation 3\"n\" + 1 of the function \"f\" is replaced by the common substitute \"shortcut\" relation (3\"n\" + 1)/2, the Collatz graph is defined by the inverse relation,\n\nFor any integer \"n\", \"n\" ≡ 1 (mod 2) iff (3\"n\" + 1)/2 ≡ 2 (mod 3). Equivalently, (2\"n\" − 1)/3 ≡ 1 (mod 2) iff \"n\" ≡ 2 (mod 3). Conjecturally, this inverse relation forms a tree except for a 1–2 loop (the inverse of the 1–2 loop of the function f(n) revised as indicated above).\n\nAlternately, replace the 3\"n\" + 1 with \" n' / H(n') \" where \" n' \" = 3\"n\" + 1 and \" H(n') \" is the highest power of 2 that divides \" n' \" (with no remainder). The resulting function \" f \" maps from odd numbers to odd numbers. Now suppose that for some odd number \"n\", applying this operation \" k \" times yields the number 1 (that is, formula_17). Then in binary, the number \" n \" can be written as the concatenation of strings \"w\" \"w\" … \"w\" where each \"w\" is a finite and contiguous extract from the representation of 1/3. The representation of \" n \" therefore holds the repetends of 1/3, where each repetend is optionally rotated and then replicated up to a finite number of bits. It is only in binary that this occurs. Conjecturally, every binary string \"s\" that ends with a '1' can be reached by a representation of this form (where we may add or delete leading '0's to \"s\").\n\nRepeated applications of the Collatz function can be represented as an abstract machine that handles strings of bits. The machine will perform the following three steps on any odd number until only one \"1\" remains:\n\n\nThis prescription is plainly equivalent to computing a Hailstone sequence in base two.\n\nThe starting number 7 is written in base two as 111. The resulting Hailstone sequence is:\n\nFor this section, consider the Collatz function in the slightly modified form\n\nThis can be done because when \"n\" is odd, 3\"n\" + 1 is always even.\n\nIf P(…) is the parity of a number, that is P(2\"n\") = 0 and P(2\"n\" + 1) = 1, then we can define the Hailstone parity sequence (or parity vector) for a number \"n\" as \"p\" = P(\"a\"), where \"a\" = \"n\", and \"a\" = \"f\"(\"a\").\n\nWhat operation is performed (3n + 1)/2 or n/2 depends on the parity. The parity sequence is the same as the sequence of operations.\nUsing this form for \"f\"(\"n\"), it can be shown that the parity sequences for two numbers \"m\" and \"n\" will agree in the first \"k\" terms if and only if \"m\" and \"n\" are equivalent modulo 2. This implies that every number is uniquely identified by its parity sequence, and moreover that if there are multiple Hailstone cycles, then their corresponding parity cycles must be different.\n\nApplying the \"f\" function \"k\" times to the number \"a\"·2 + \"b\" will give the result \"a\"·3 + \"d\", where \"d\" is the result of applying the \"f\" function \"k\" times to \"b\", and \"c\" is how many odd numbers were encountered during that sequence.\n\nFor the Collatz function in the form\n\nformula_19\n\nHailstone sequences can be computed by the extremely simple\n\"a\" → \"bc\", \"b\" → \"a\", \"c\" → \"aaa\". In this system, the positive integer \"n\" is represented by a string of \"n\" \"a\", and iteration of the tag operation halts on any word of length less than 2. (Adapted from De Mol.)\n\nThe Collatz conjecture equivalently states that this tag system, with an arbitrary finite string of \"a\"'s as the initial word, eventually halts (see \"\" for a worked example).\n\nAn extension to the Collatz conjecture is to include all integers, not just positive integers. Leaving aside the cycle 0 → 0 which cannot be entered from outside, there are a total of 4 known cycles, which all nonzero integers seem to eventually fall into under iteration of \"f\". These cycles are listed here, starting with the well-known cycle for positive \"n\":\n\nOdd values are listed in large bold. Each cycle is listed with its member of least absolute value (which is always odd) first.\n\nThe generalized Collatz conjecture is the assertion that every integer, under iteration by \"f\", eventually falls into one of the four cycles above or the cycle 0 → 0.\nThe 0 → 0 cycle is often regarded as \"trivial\" by the argument, as it is only included for the sake of completeness.\n\nThe standard Collatz map can be extended to (positive or negative) rational numbers which have odd denominators when written in lowest terms. The number is taken to be odd or even according to whether its numerator is odd or even. A closely related fact is that the Collatz map extends to the ring of 2-adic integers, which contains the ring of rationals with odd denominators as a subring.\n\nThe parity sequences as defined above are no longer unique for fractions. However, it can be shown that any possible parity cycle is the parity sequence for exactly one fraction: if a cycle has length \"n\" and includes odd numbers exactly \"m\" times at indices \"k\", …, \"k\", then the unique fraction which generates that parity cycle is\n\nFor example, the parity cycle (1 0 1 1 0 0 1) has length 7 and has 4 odd numbers at indices 0, 2, 3, and 6. The unique fraction which generates that parity cycle is\n\nthe complete cycle being: 151/47 → 250/47 → 125/47 → 211/47 → 340/47 → 170/47 → 85/47 → 151/47\n\nAlthough the cyclic permutations of the original parity sequence are unique fractions, the cycle is not unique, each permutation's fraction being the next number in the loop cycle:\n\nAlso, for uniqueness, the parity sequence should be \"prime\", i.e., not partitionable into identical sub-sequences. For example, parity sequence (1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0) can be partitioned into two identical sub-sequences (1 1 0 0)(1 1 0 0). Calculating the 8-element sequence fraction gives\nBut when reduced to lowest terms {5/7}, it is the same as that of the 4-element sub-sequence\nAnd this is because the 8-element parity sequence actually represents two circuits of the loop cycle defined by the 4-element parity sequence.\n\nIn this context, the Collatz conjecture is equivalent to saying that (0 1) is the only cycle which is generated by positive whole numbers (i.e. 1 and 2).\n\n also gives a rough idea about how one can prove that cycles of certain lengths do not exist. For a hypothetical cycle of length \"n\", the numerator is bounded above by 3 - 2 (this corresponds to a cycle of all odd numbers). A lower bound for the denominator can be obtained by letting \"n\"/\"m\" be an optimal rational approximation to log(3)/log(2). Together these give an upper bound for the unique fraction that generates a cycle of length \"n\". If this upper bound is smaller than the largest number for which the conjecture has been verified to hold, then a cycle of length \"n\" is impossible.\n\nThe Collatz map can be viewed as the restriction to the integers of the smooth real and complex map\n\nwhich simplifies to formula_30\n\nIf the standard Collatz map defined above is optimized by replacing the relation 3\"n\" + 1 with the common substitute \"shortcut\" relation (3\"n\" + 1)/2, it can be viewed as the restriction to the integers of the smooth real and complex map\n\nwhich simplifies to formula_32.\n\nIterating the above optimized map in the complex plane produces the Collatz fractal.\n\nThe point of view of iteration on the real line was investigated by and on the complex plane by \n\nThe section \"As a parity sequence\" above gives a way to speed up simulation of the sequence. To jump ahead \"k\" steps on each iteration (using the \"f\" function from that section), break up the current number into two parts, \"b\" (the \"k\" least significant bits, interpreted as an integer), and \"a\" (the rest of the bits as an integer). The result of jumping ahead \"k\" steps can be found as:\n\nThe \"c\" (or better 3) and \"d\" arrays are precalculated for all possible \"k\"-bit numbers \"b\", where \"d\"(b) is the result of applying the \"f\" function \"k\" times to \"b\", and \"c\"(b) is the number of odd numbers encountered on the way. For example, if k=5, you can jump ahead 5 steps on each iteration by separating out the 5 least significant bits of a number and using:\n\nThis requires 2 precomputation and storage to speed up the resulting calculation by a factor of \"k\", a space–time tradeoff.\n\nFor the special purpose of searching for a counterexample to the Collatz conjecture, this precomputation leads to an even more important acceleration, used by Tomás Oliveira e Silva in his computational confirmations of the Collatz conjecture up to large values of \"n\". If, for some given \"b\" and \"k\", the inequality\n\nholds for all \"a\", then the first counterexample, if it exists, cannot be \"b\" modulo 2. For instance, the first counterexample must be odd because \"f\"(2\"n\") = \"n\", smaller than 2\"n\"; and it must be 3 mod 4 because \"f\"(4\"n\" + 1) = 3\"n\" + 1, smaller than 4\"n\" + 1. For each starting value \"a\" which is not a counterexample to the Collatz conjecture, there is a \"k\" for which such an inequality holds, so checking the Collatz conjecture for one starting value is as good as checking an entire congruence class. As \"k\" increases, the search only needs to check those residues \"b\" that are not eliminated by lower values of \"k\". Only an exponentially small fraction of the residues survive. For example, the only surviving residues mod 32 are 7, 15, 27, and 31.\n\nIf formula_33 is an odd integer, then formula_34 is even, so formula_35 with formula_36 odd and formula_37. The Syracuse function is the function formula_4 from the set formula_39 of odd integers into itself, for which formula_40 .\n\nSome properties of the Syracuse function are:\n\n\nThe Collatz conjecture is equivalent to the statement that, for all formula_33 in formula_39, there exists an integer formula_51 such that formula_52.\n\nIn 1972, J. H. Conway proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is algorithmically undecidable.\n\nSpecifically, he considered functions of the form\n\nwhere formula_54\nare rational numbers which are so chosen that formula_55 is always\nintegral.\n\nThe standard Collatz function is given by formula_56, formula_57, formula_58, formula_59, formula_60. Conway proved that the problem:\n\nis undecidable, by representing the halting problem in this way.\nCloser to the Collatz problem is the following \"universally quantified\" problem:\n\nModifying the condition in this way can make a problem either harder or easier to solve (intuitively, it is harder to justify a positive answer but might be easier to justify a negative one). Kurtz and Simon\nproved that the above problem is, in fact, undecidable and even higher in the arithmetical hierarchy, specifically formula_63-complete. This hardness result holds even if one restricts the class of functions \"g\" by fixing the modulus \"P\" to 6480.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41646174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41646174", "title": "Dick (slang)", "text": "Dick (slang)\n\nDick is a common English language dysphemism used for a variety of slang purposes, some generally considered vulgar. It is used to refer to the penis, and by extension as a verb to describe sexual activity. It is also used as a pejorative term for individuals who are considered to be rude, abrasive, inconsiderate, or otherwise contemptible. In this context, it can be used interchangeably with \"jerk\", and can also be used as a verb to describe rude or deceitful actions. Variants include dickhead, which literally refers to the glans. The offensiveness of the word \"dick\" is complicated by the continued use of the word in inoffensive contexts, including as both a given name and a surname, in the popular British dessert spotted dick, in the classic novel \"Moby-Dick\", and in the \"Dick and Jane\" series of children's books. Uses such as these have provided a basis for comedy writers to exploit this juxtaposition through double entendre.\n\nThe word connoted a person of questionable character long before it became a nickname for the penis. For example, in the 1665 satire \"The English Rogue\" by Richard Head, an unsavory character is referred to as a \"dick\":\nAn 1869 slang dictionary offered definitions of \"dick\" including \"a riding whip\" and an abbreviation of dictionary, also noting that in the North Country, it was used as a verb to indicate that a policeman was eyeing the subject. The term came to be associated with the penis through usage by men in the military around the 1880s.\n\n\"Dick\", when used in many of its slang connotations, is generally considered at least mildly offensive. \n\nIn 1994, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts upheld a school policy under which a student was prohibited from wearing a T-shirt with a double entendre, reading \"See Dick Drink. See Dick Drive. See Dick Die. Don’t be a Dick.\" The court in this case held that a legitimate goal of the school—to calm a sexually charged environment and enhance the ability of students to learn—made it unlikely that this restriction was a violation of any First Amendment rights. This decision was vacated the following year by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which noted that students have the right to express their views, and that the T-shirt, \"though reasonably thought vulgar\", did express a view.\n\nIn 2001, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) published guidelines that summarized instances in which a number of media outlets had violated indecency laws when using the word \"dick\" in a sexual context. These included, for example, the State University of New York's WSUC-FM, in Cortland, New York, which in 1993 was fined for broadcasting a rap titled \"I'm Not Your Puppet\", which referenced \"shoving my dick up this bitch's behind\" in one lyric, and stated in another, \"I pulled out my dick, popped it in her mouth, and she sucked it.\" In the same report, however, the FCC noted that in 1990, it had ruled that WFBQ (FM)/WNDE (AM) in Indianapolis had not engaged in indecency when it broadcast the line \"So you talk to Dick Nixon, man you get him on the phone and Dick suggests maybe getting like a mega-Dick to help out, but you know, you remember the time the King ate mega-Dick under the table at a 095 picnic\", and a parody commercial referencing a fictional monster truck called \"Big Peter! Formerly the Big Dick's Dog Wiener Mobile\". In January 2005, the FCC released a ruling that it would not fine broadcasters whose programs used \"dick\" on the air to refer to a person behaving contemptibly. Specifically, the FCC stated in its ruling:\n\nThe name of the traditional British dessert spotted dick has occasionally been perceived as potentially embarrassing, prompting hospital managers at Gloucestershire NHS Trust (in 2001) and the catering staff at Flintshire County Council (in 2009) to rename the pudding \"Spotted Richard\" on menus, as many customers made \"immature comments\" about the pudding. Gloucestershire NHS Trust restored the original name in 2002 and Flintshire County Council reversed their renaming after a few weeks.\n\nThe word \"dick\" has (or has had) other slang meanings, for instance:\n\n"}

{"id": "17205710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17205710", "title": "Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia", "text": "Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia\n\nThe Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia (  , \"\") is the Egyptian Arabic version of Wikipedia, a free, open-content encyclopaedia. This Wikipedia primarily acts as an alternative to the Arabic Wikipedia in favor of speakers of the Egyptian dialect. It is the only Wikipedia written in a dialect of Arabic.\n\nThis edition of Wikipedia has articles and registered users, including administrators.\n\nThe Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia was and started as a developing project on 2 April 2008 in the Wikimedia Incubator. A Wikipedian with the username Ghaly was the founder of the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia. Dr. Ivan Panović, the author of \"The Beginnings of Wikipedia Masry,\" described Ghaly as the \"spiritus movens\" of the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia. Florence Devouard, the former president of the Wikimedia Foundation, stated that the foundation wanted Wikipedians to participate in their native languages.\n\nThe , and the announcement was made on the first day of Wikimania 2008 in Alexandria. On 24 November 2008, the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia was officially launched, and the Incubator articles were transferred to the new domain.\n\nIn 2009, the Wikipedia had 4,000 articles, and Wikipedians participating came from within and outside Egypt. By 2010 the Masry Wikipedia had almost 6,000 articles. That year, Panović wrote that \"The number of active contributors is still rather small, yet their entries seem to be growing.\" At the time many of the articles were very short articles, or \"stubs\". Panović wrote that editors of the Masry Wikipedia had a tendency of creating new articles \"just for the sake of increasing their number in hopes of expanding them later.\"\n\nThe origin of the proposal for the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia is based on the active interest of some Egyptian Wikipedians in contributing articles, especially on the Arabic Wikipedia, as they constitute large group of the serious contributors in that Wikipedia.\n\nThe idea behind the creation of the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia is to have an encyclopedia that is written in the language that Egyptians use in their everyday lives. It is hoped this will be much easier for Egyptians to read and encourage more Egyptians to contribute to Wikipedia.\n\nPanović stated that \"it is clear that Masry Wikipedians are the proponents of Egyptian territorial nationalism of a kind that sets itself apart from Arab or Islamic nationalism, seeking to carve out a specifically Egyptian identity\" and he argued that therefore there was an \"ease\" in which the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedians \"seem to embrace and promote some radical and even erroneous ideas about language.\" Ghaly is a Christian, and Panović stated that \"judging by their contributions and/or user pages\" several of those involved are also Christian; Panović stated that minority groups tend to be more active in identity politics.\n\nThe International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) classification of Egyptian Arabic under the language code \"arz\" is one of the arguments used by Egyptian Arabic Wikipedians for considering Masry an independent language. The project uses the Cairene-style Egyptian Arabic.\n\nGhaly, in the Wikimedia Foundation proposal page for the Egyptian Wikipedia, stated that his view of the Masry Wikipedia was that it would be \"written in layperson terms and a mixture between Egyptian slang and simple Arabic\", conveying \"the information to speakers of Egyptian Arabic in a way similar to what Wikipedia Simple English is doing currently in comparison to Wikipedia English.\" In response some Wikipedians criticized the proposal stating that it would be a Simple Arabic Wikipedia. Ghaly responded, arguing that he did not intend to actually start a simple Arabic Wikipedia.\n\n, the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia has over 11,000 articles and continues to grow. In addition, there is a project to develop an Egyptian Arabic Wiktionary, which is in the development phase as a project on Wikimedia incubator.\n\nThe Egyptian variant of Wikipedia was controversially received; supporters pointed to the number of Wikipedias written in regional languages and argued that Egyptian Arabic was a widely spoken variant of Arabic, while opponents perceived the creation of the Egyptian language Wikipedia as an attack on the Arabic Wikipedia and argued that Standard Arabic was the standard language for media, and the use of a regional language version was anachronistic.\n\nThe Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia has been subject to controversy from the start, causing arguments between supporters and opponents. There have been lengthy discussions before the approval of the proposal. Also, there were discussions on other websites apart from meta.Wikimedia. This was also based on the differences in definition of a language and a dialect. This is a result of diglossia in Egypt, where the written language is a different dialect than the language used daily, which is not frequently written, although a certain amount of literature (particularly plays and poetry) exists written in the Egyptian dialect in Egypt.\n\nThe proposal has been supported by many users and gained the approval of the language committee on Wikimedia. The wiki has less than 5 active editors who did lead to an increase in the number of articles.\n\nAmira Samir of the \"Al-Ahram Hebdo\" reported that some Egyptians on the internet did not have a problem with the project, arguing that the Wikimedia Foundation was an independent body and therefore the Egyptian government could not force the inclusion or exclusion of any particular dialect.\n\nDiscussions and criticism has occurred in some Facebook groups and several blogs and forums. Samir stated that many online users believed that the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia was an attack on the Arabic language. The primary criticism of the Wikipedia Masry involves the belief that a \"degradation\" of Arabic occurred when someone writes in a dialect. Panović argues that the criticism is \"grounded in folk belief about language\" and therefore it is a \"futile task\" to examine the arguments from a linguistic point of view. According to Panović, many of the critics took note that many involved with the Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia were Christian and that they perceived the project to be antagonistic against the Arab identity and Islam. Panović wrote that \"It almost goes without saying there are also those who see in Wikipedia Masry yet another Jewish plot.\" Others see it as an attempt to divide the Arabs by emphasizing dialects. According to Samir, some critics argued that the Egyptian Arabic language has a lack of rules and variations of meanings in words, and so it is an unsuitable language for an encyclopedia.\n\nOpposition to this version of Wikipedia has been strong during the proposal stage; opposition continued after the project officially launched including campaigns on Facebook. Some of these campaigns encouraged users to vandalize the Egyptian Wikipedia. The main point which the opposition focuses on is that Egyptian Arabic is not a language, suggesting that the effort should be directed to development of Arabic Wikipedia.\nThe effectiveness of these campaigns remains to be seen, as the Wikipedia articles are still being developed and number of users is increasing.\n\nSome critics gave racist criticism. For example, most of those who are included in the Egyptian version are Christians, or they are a Jewish conspiracy, and they forget that the language is not only a means of communication between the people and this is the main objective of its existence it is also used in all aspects of life among Egyptians, for example, social communication and social media sites they don't use the standard Arabic language As well as some authors by writing a lexicon of the language of the Egyptian language, which was issued recently and celebrations by the Library of Alexandria .\n\n\n\n"}

He was the architect of first ever Cultural Policy of Pakistan promulgated in 1995.\n\nFakhar Zaman’s five books were banned by the Military Regime of General Zia-UL-Haq, forcibly lifted from the book shops and burnt publicly. After a litigation of 18 years, the ban was lifted by Lahore High Court in 1996.\n\nIn 1984, he spent a few months in Stockholm University, Sweden attending seminars and lecturing on social sciences. He writes in Urdu, Punjabi and English language and till date has authored nearly 40 books. He was in Jail for months during the martial law period where he started writing his famous Punjabi novel “Bandiwan” translated into English as “The Prisoner” and published by UNESCO and Peter Owen of London. His Punjabi writings have been translated into major languages in the world and are taught at post-graduate level in Pakistan, India and some foreign countries. A number of PhD and M-Phil theses have been written on his Punjabi novels and poetry in India.\n\nWhen Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was assassinated on 27 December 2007, he was in Vienna, Austria. When he took over as Chairman Pakistan Academy of Letters in 2008, he published a number of books on the life and thoughts of 'Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed'. The history of PPP and the chronological events since the foundation of the party in 1967 has been written by Fakhar Zaman on the website of PPP.\n\nDuring his chairmanship of Pakistan Academy of Letters (11 May 2008 – 12 March 2012), he produced fourteen documentaries in English on the Sufi poets of Pakistan of about 40 minutes duration each.

Finnish is one of the two official languages of Finland (the other being the Swedish language); Finnish is also an official minority language in Sweden. In Sweden, both Standard Finnish and Meänkieli, a Finnish dialect, are spoken. The Kven language, a dialect of Finnish, is spoken in Northern Norway by a minority group of Finnish descent.\n\nFinnish is a member of the Finnic language family and is typologically between fusional and agglutinative languages. It modifies and inflects nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numerals and verbs, depending on their roles in the sentence.\n\nFinnish is a member of the Finnic group of the Uralic family of languages. The Finnic group also includes Estonian and a few minority languages spoken around the Baltic Sea.\n\nFinnish demonstrates an affiliation with other Uralic languages (such as Hungarian) in several respects including:\n\n\nSeveral theories exist as to the geographic origin of Finnish and the other Uralic languages. The most widely held view is that they originated as a Proto-Uralic language somewhere in the boreal forest belt around the Ural Mountains region and/or the bend of the middle Volga. The strong case for Proto-Uralic is supported by common vocabulary with regularities in sound correspondences, as well as by the fact that the Uralic languages have many similarities in structure and grammar.\n\nThe Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, United States classifies Finnish as a level III language (of 4 levels) in terms of learning difficulty for native English speakers.\n\nFinnish is spoken by about five million people, most of whom reside in Finland. There are also notable Finnish-speaking minorities in Sweden, Norway, Russia, Estonia, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. The majority of the population of Finland, 90.37% , speak Finnish as their first language. The remainder speak Swedish (5.42%), Sami (Northern, Inari, Skolt) and other languages. It is spoken as a second language in Estonia by about 167,000 people.\n\nFinnish is one of two official languages of Finland (the other being Swedish, spoken by 5.42% of the population ) and one of the official languages in the European Union since 1995. Finnish language started to gain its role during the Grand Duchy of Finland, along with the nationalistic Fennoman movement, and obtained its official status in the Finnish Diet of 1863. It enjoys the status of an official minority language in Sweden. Under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries speaking Finnish have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs. Concerns about future status of Finnish language in Sweden have been expressed.\n\nThe Finnic languages evolved from the Proto-Finnic language after Sámi was separated from it around 1500–1000 BCE. Current models assume three or more hypothetical Proto-Finnic proto-dialects evolving over the first millennium BCE.\n\nBirch bark letter 292 from the early 13th Century is the first known document in any Finnic language. The first known written example of Finnish was found in a German travel journal dating back to c.1450: \"Mÿnna tachton gernast spuho somen gelen emÿna daÿda\" (Modern Finnish: \"Minä tahdon kernaasti puhua suomen kieltä, [mutta] en minä taida;\" English: \"I want to speak Finnish, [but] I am not able\"). According to the travel journal, a Finnish bishop, whose name is unknown, was behind the above quotation. The contextually erroneous accusative case in \"gelen\" (Finnish \"kielen\") and the lack of the conjunction \"mutta\" seem to indicate a foreign speaker with an incomplete grasp of Finnish grammar, as errors with the numerous noun cases are typical of those learning Finnish. Finnish priestdom at the time was largely Swedish-speaking.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, when Finland was under Swedish rule, Finnish was solely an oral language. At the time the language of large-scale business was Middle Low German, the language of administration Swedish, and religious activities were held in Latin. This left few possibilities for Finnish-speakers to use their mother tongue in situations other than daily chores. From Swedish perspective Finnish was considered as an inferior language and in practice Finns lacked societal rights because they could not represent themselves in any official situation with their language. Swedes strived to obviate Finnish via clerk schools and Church service and by moving Swedish speaking population to Finnish speaking areas.\n\nThe first comprehensive writing system for Finnish was created by Mikael Agricola, a Finnish bishop, in the 16th century. He based his orthography on Swedish, German, and Latin. His ultimate plan was to translate the Bible, but first he had to define rules on which the Finnish standard language still relies, particularly with respect to spelling.\n\nAgricola's written language was based on western dialects of Finnish, and his intention was that each phoneme should correspond to one letter. Yet, Agricola was confronted with many problems in this endeavour and failed to achieve uniformity. This is why he might use different signs for the same phonemes depending on the situation. For example, he used \"dh\" or \"d\" to represent the voiced dental fricative (English \"th\" in \"this\") and \"tz\" or \"z\" to represent the geminate voiceless dental fricative (the \"th\" in \"thin\"). Additionally, Agricola might use \"gh\" or \"g\" to represent the voiced velar fricative and either \"ch\", \"c\" or \"h\" for . For example, he wrote \"techtin\" against modern spelling \"tehtiin\".\n\nOthers revised Agricola's work later, striving for a more phonemic system. Along the way, Finnish lost some of its phonemes. The sounds and disappeared from the standard language, surviving only in a small rural region in Western Finland. Elsewhere, traces of these phonemes persist as their disappearance gave Finnish dialects their distinct qualities. For example, became \"ht\" or \"tt\" (e.g. meþþä → mehtä, mettä) in the eastern dialects and in some western dialects. In the standard language, however, the effect of the lost phonemes is thus:\n\nModern Finnish punctuation, along with that of Swedish, uses the colon character to separate the stem of the word and its grammatical ending in some cases (such as after abbreviations), where some other alphabetic writing systems would use an apostrophe. Suffixes are required for correct grammar, so this is often applied, e.g. \"EU:ssa\" \"in the EU\".\n\nIn the 19th century Johan Vilhelm Snellman and others began to stress the need to improve the status of Finnish. Ever since the days of Mikael Agricola, written Finnish had been used almost exclusively in religious contexts, but now Snellman's Hegelian nationalistic ideas of Finnish as a fully-fledged national language gained considerable support. Concerted efforts were made to improve the status of the language and to modernize it, and by the end of the century Finnish had become a language of administration, journalism, literature, and science in Finland, along with Swedish.\n\nThe most important contributions to improving the status of Finnish were made by Elias Lönnrot. His impact on the development of modern vocabulary in Finnish was particularly important. In addition to compiling the \"Kalevala\", he acted as an arbiter in disputes about the development of standard Finnish between the proponents of western and eastern dialects, ensuring that the western dialects Agricola had preferred preserved their preeminent role, while many originally dialect words from Eastern Finland were introduced to the standard language, enriching it considerably. The first novel written in Finnish (and by a Finnish speaker) was \"Seven Brothers\" (\"Seitsemän veljestä\"), published by Aleksis Kivi in 1870.\n\nThe Finnish language has been changing in certain ways after World War II, which has been observed in the spreading of certain dialectal features (for example the spread of Western allophone of the cluster ts (mettä: mettän/metän (forest: forest's) instead of metsä) and the Eastern disappearance of d-sound (tiän/tiij(j)än ((i) know)) instead of the Western allophones) and the simultaneous preference to abandon the more visible dialectal features. Some scientists have also reported the moving of the ä-sound towards the a-sound, even theorising that the Finnish speakers would start to pronounce the a-sound even more distantly from the changing ä-sound in order to preserve vowel harmony.\n\nThe dialects of Finnish are divided into two distinct groups, Western and Eastern. The dialects are almost entirely mutually intelligible and are distinguished from each other by only minor changes in vowels, diphthongs and rhythm. For the most part, the dialects operate on the same phonology, grammar and vocabulary. There are only marginal examples of sounds or grammatical constructions specific to some dialect and not found in standard Finnish. Two examples are the voiced dental fricative found in the Rauma dialect, and the Eastern exessive case.\n\nThe classification of closely related dialects spoken outside Finland is a politically sensitive issue that has been controversial since Finland's independence in 1917. This concerns specifically the Karelian language in Russia and Meänkieli in Sweden, the speakers of which are often considered oppressed minorities. Karelian is different enough from standard Finnish to have its own orthography. Meänkieli is a northern dialect entirely intelligible to speakers of any other Finnish dialect, which achieved its status as an official minority language in Sweden for historical and political reasons, although Finnish is an official minority language in Sweden, too.\n\nThe Southwestern dialects (\"lounaismurteet\") are spoken in Southwest Finland and Satakunta. Their typical feature is abbreviation of word-final vowels, and in many respects they resemble Estonian. The Tavastian dialects (\"hämäläismurteet\") are spoken in Tavastia. They are closest to the standard language, but feature some slight vowel changes, such as the opening of diphthong-final vowels (\"tie → tiä\", \"miekka → miakka\", \"kuolisi → kualis\"), the change of d to l (mostly obsolete) or trilled r (widespread, nowadays disappearance of d is popular) and the personal pronouns (me:meitin (we: our), te:teitin (you:your) and he: heitin (they: their)). The Southern Ostrobothnian dialects (\"eteläpohjalaiset murteet\") are spoken in Southern Ostrobothnia. Their most notable feature is the pronunciation of 'd' as a tapped or even fully trilled . The Middle and North Ostrobothnia dialects (\"keski- ja pohjoispohjalaiset murteet\") are spoken in Central and Northern Ostrobothnia. The Far Northern dialects (\"peräpohjalaiset murteet\") are spoken in Lapland. The dialects spoken in the western parts of Lapland are recognizable by retention of old 'h' sounds in positions where they have disappeared from other dialects.\n\nOne of the Far Northern dialects, Meänkieli, which is spoken on the Swedish side of the border, is taught in some Swedish schools as a distinct standardized language. The speakers of Meänkieli became politically separated from the other Finns when Finland was annexed to Russia in 1809. The categorization of Meänkieli as a separate language is controversial among the Finns, who see no linguistic criteria, only political reasons, for treating Meänkieli differently from other dialects of Finnish.\n\nThe Kven language is spoken in Finnmark and Troms, in Norway. Its speakers are descendants of Finnish emigrants to the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. Kven is an official minority language in Norway.\n\nThe Eastern dialects consist of the widespread Savonian dialects (\"savolaismurteet\") spoken in Savo and nearby areas, and the South-Eastern dialects now spoken only in Finnish South Karelia. The South-Eastern dialects (\"kaakkoismurteet\") were previously also spoken on the Karelian Isthmus and in Ingria. The Karelian Isthmus was evacuated during World War II and refugees were resettled all over Finland. Most Ingrian Finns were deported to various interior areas of the Soviet Union.\n\nPalatalization, a common feature of Uralic languages, had been lost in the Finnic branch, but it has been reacquired by most of these languages, including Eastern Finnish, but not Western Finnish. In Finnish orthography, this is denoted with a 'j', e.g. \"vesj\" [vesʲ] 'water', cf. standard \"vesi\".\n\nThe language spoken in those parts of Karelia that have not historically been under Swedish or Finnish rule is usually called the Karelian language, and it is considered to be more distant from standard Finnish than the Eastern dialects. Whether this language of Russian Karelia is a dialect of Finnish or a separate language is a matter of interpretation. However, the term \"Karelian dialects\" is often used colloquially for the Finnish South-Eastern dialects.\n\nThere are two main varieties of Finnish used throughout the country. One is the \"standard language\" (\"yleiskieli\"), and the other is the \"spoken language\" (\"puhekieli\"). The standard language is used in formal situations like political speeches and newscasts. Its written form, the \"book language\" (\"kirjakieli\"), is used in nearly all written texts, not always excluding even the dialogue of common people in popular prose. The spoken language, on the other hand, is the main variety of Finnish used in popular TV and radio shows and at workplaces, and may be preferred to a dialect in personal communication.\n\nStandard Finnish is prescribed by the Language Office of the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland and is the language used in official communication. The Dictionary of Contemporary Finnish (\"Nykysuomen sanakirja\" 1951–61), with 201,000 entries, was a prescriptive dictionary that defined official language. An additional volume for words of foreign origin (\"Nykysuomen sivistyssanakirja\", 30,000 entries) was published in 1991. An updated dictionary, The New Dictionary of Modern Finnish (\"Kielitoimiston sanakirja\") was published in an electronic form in 2004 and in print in 2006. A descriptive grammar (\"Iso suomen kielioppi\", 1,600 pages) was published in 2004. There is also an etymological dictionary, \"Suomen sanojen alkuperä\", published in 1992–2000, and a handbook of contemporary language (\"Nykysuomen käsikirja\"), and a periodic publication, \"Kielikello\". Standard Finnish is used in official texts and is the form of language taught in schools. Its spoken form is used in political speech, newscasts, in courts, and in other formal situations. Nearly all publishing and printed works are in standard Finnish.\n\nThe colloquial language has mostly developed naturally from earlier forms of Finnish, and spread from the main cultural and political centres. The standard language, however, has always been a consciously constructed medium for literature. It preserves grammatical patterns that have mostly vanished from the colloquial varieties and, as its main application is writing, it features complex syntactic patterns that are not easy to handle when used in speech. The colloquial language develops significantly faster, and the grammatical and phonological simplifications also include the most common pronouns and suffixes, which amount to frequent but modest differences. Some sound changes have been left out of the formal language, such as the irregularization of some common verbs by assimilation, e.g. \"tule-\" → \"tuu-\" ('come', only when the second syllable is short, so the third person singular does not contract: \"hän tulee\" 'he comes', never *\"hän tuu\"; also \"mene-\" → \"mee-\"). However, the longer forms such as \"tule\" can be used in spoken language in other forms as well.\n\nThe literary language certainly still exerts a considerable influence upon the spoken word, because illiteracy is nonexistent and many Finns are avid readers. In fact, it is still not entirely uncommon to meet people who \"talk book-ish\" (\"puhuvat kirjakieltä\"); it may have connotations of pedantry, exaggeration, moderation, weaseling or sarcasm (somewhat like heavy use of Latinate words in English: compare the difference between saying \"There's no children I'll leave it to\" and \"There are no children to whom I shall leave it\".). More common is the intrusion of typically literary constructions into a colloquial discourse, as a kind of quote from written Finnish. It should also be noted that it is quite common to hear book-like and polished speech on radio or TV, and the constant exposure to such language tends to lead to the adoption of such constructions even in everyday language.\n\nA prominent example of the effect of the standard language is the development of the consonant gradation form /ts : ts/ as in \"metsä : metsän\", as this pattern was originally (1940) found natively only in the dialects of the southern Karelian isthmus and Ingria. It has been reinforced by the spelling 'ts' for the dental fricative , used earlier in some western dialects. The spelling and the pronunciation this encourages however approximate the original pronunciation, still reflected in e.g. Karelian /čč : č/ (\"meččä : mečän\"). In the spoken language, a fusion of Western /tt : tt/ (\"mettä : mettän\") and Eastern /ht : t/ (\"mehtä : metän\") has resulted: /tt : t/ (\"mettä : metän\"). It is notable that neither of these forms are identifiable as, or originate from, a specific dialect.\n\nThe orthography of informal language follows that of the formal. However, in signalling the former in writing, syncope and sandhi – especially internal – may occasionally amongst other characteristics be transcribed, e.g. \"menenpä\" → \"me(n)empä\". This never occurs in the standard variety.\n\nNote that there are noticeable differences between dialects. Also note that here the formal language does not mean a language spoken in formal occasions but the standard language which exists practically only in written form.\n\nThe phoneme inventory of Finnish is moderately large, with a great number of vocalic segments and a restricted set of consonant types, both of which can be long or short. \n\nFinnish monophthongs show eight vowels qualities that contrast in duration, thus 16 vowel phonemes in total. Allophony is restricted. Vowel phonemes are always contrastive in word-initial syllables; for noninitial syllable, see morphophonology below. Mid vowels tend to be open-mid. Long and short vowels are shown below. \n\nThe usual analysis is that Finnish has long and short vowels and consonants as distinct phonemes. However, long vowels may be analyzed as a vowel followed by a chroneme, or also, that sequences of identical vowels are pronounced as \"diphthongs\". The quality of long vowels mostly overlaps with the quality of short vowels, with the exception of u, which is centralized with respect to uu; long vowels do not morph into diphthongs. There are eighteen phonemic diphthongs; like vowels, diphthongs do not have significant allophony.\n\nFinnish has a consonant inventory of small to moderate size, where voicing is mostly not distinctive, and fricatives are scarce. Finnish has relatively few non-coronal consonants. Consonants are as follows, where consonants in parenthesis are found only in a few recent loans, and may be mispronounced by uneducated speakers.\n\nAlmost all consonants have phonemic short and long (geminated) forms, although length is only constrastive in consonants word-medially.\n\nConsonant clusters are mostly absent in native Finnish words, except for a small set of two-consonant sequences in syllable codas, e.g. 'rs' in \"karsta\". However, because of a number of recently adopted loanwords that have them, e.g. \"strutsi\" from Swedish \"struts\", meaning \"ostrich\", clusters have been integrated to the modern language to different degrees.\n\nFinnish is somewhat divergent from other Uralic languages in two respects: it has lost most fricatives, as well as losing the distinction between palatalized and non-palatalized consonants. Finnish has only two fricatives in native words, namely and . All other fricatives are recognized as foreign, of which Finnish speakers can usually reliably distinguish and . (The official alphabet includes 'z' [z] and 'ž' [ʒ], but these are rarely used correctly, including by the Swedish-speakers, who also struggle with those sounds.) Palatalization is characteristic of Uralic languages, but Finnish has lost it. However, the Eastern dialects and the Karelian language have redeveloped a system of palatalization. For example, the Karelian word \"d'uuri\" , with a palatalized , is reflected by \"juuri\" in Finnish and Savo dialect \"vesj\" is \"vesi\" in standard Finnish.\n\nA feature of Finnic phonology is the development of labial and rounded vowels in non-initial syllables, as in the word \"tyttö\". Proto-Uralic had only 'a' and 'i' and their vowel harmonic allophones in non-initial syllables; modern Finnish allows other vowels in non-initial syllables, although they are uncommon compared to 'a', 'ä' and 'i'.\n\nCharacteristic features of Finnish (common to some other Uralic languages) are vowel harmony and an agglutinative morphology; owing to the extensive use of the latter, words can be quite long.\n\nThe main stress is always on the first syllable, and it is articulated by adding approximately 100 ms more length to the stressed vowel. Stress does not cause any measurable modifications in vowel quality (very much unlike English). However, stress is not strong and words appear evenly stressed. In some cases, stress is so weak that the highest points of volume, pitch and other indicators of \"articulation intensity\" are not on the first syllable, although native speakers recognize the first syllable as a stressed syllable.\n\nFinnish has several morphophonological processes that require modification of the forms of words for daily speech. The most important processes are vowel harmony and consonant gradation.\n\nVowel harmony is a redundancy feature, which means that the feature [±back] is uniform within a word, and so it is necessary to interpret it only once for a given word. It is meaning-distinguishing in the initial syllable, and suffixes follow; so, if the listener hears [±back] in any part of the word, they can derive [±back] for the initial syllable. For example, from the stem \"tuote\" (\"product\") one derives \"tuotteeseensa\" (\"into his product\"), where the final vowel becomes the back vowel 'a' (rather than the front vowel 'ä') because the initial syllable contains the back vowels 'uo'. This is especially notable because vowels 'a' and 'ä' are different, meaning-distinguishing phonemes, not interchangeable or allophonic. Finnish front vowels are not umlauts.\n\nConsonant gradation is a partly nonproductive lenition process for P, T and K in inherited vocabulary, with the oblique stem \"weakened\" from the nominative stem, or vice versa. For example, \"tarkka\" \"precise\" has the oblique stem \"tarka-\", as in \"tarkan\" \"of the precise\". There is also another gradation pattern, which is older, and causes simple elision of T and K in suffixes. However, it is very common since it is found in the partitive case marker: if V is a single vowel, V+\"ta\" → Va, e.g. *\"tarkka+ta\" → \"tarkkaa\".\n\nFinnish is a synthetic language that employs extensive regular agglutination of modifiers to verbs, nouns, adjectives and numerals. However, Finnish is not a polysynthetic language, although non-finite dependent clauses may be contracted to infinitives (\"lauseenvastike\", e.g. \"juode·ssa·ni\" \"when I was drinking\", lit. \"drink-in-I\", that is \"during my drinking\").\n\nThe morphosyntactic alignment is nominative–accusative; but there are two object cases: accusative and partitive. The contrast between the two is telic, where the accusative case denotes actions completed as intended (\"Ammuin hirven\" \"I shot (killed) the elk\"), and the partitive case denotes incomplete actions (\"Ammuin hirveä\" \"I shot (at) the elk\"). Often this is confused with perfectivity, but the only element of perfectivity that exists in Finnish is that there are some perfective verbs. Transitivity is distinguished by different verbs for transitive and intransitive, e.g. \"ratkaista\" \"to solve something\" vs. \"ratketa\" \"to solve by itself\". There are several frequentative and momentane verb categories.\n\nVerbs gain personal suffixes for each person; these suffixes are grammatically more important than pronouns, which are often not used at all in standard Finnish. The infinitive is not the uninflected form but has a suffix \"-ta\" or \"-da\"; the closest one to an uninflected form is the third person singular indicative. There are four persons, first (\"I, we\"), second (\"you (singular), you (plural)\"), third (\"s/he, they\"). The passive voice (sometimes called impersonal or indefinite) resembles a \"fourth person\" similar to, e.g., English \"people say/do/...\". There are four tenses, namely present, past, perfect and pluperfect; the system mirrors the Germanic system. The future tense is not needed, because of context and the telic contrast. For example, \"luen kirjan\" \"I read a book (completely)\" indicates a future, when \"luen kirjaa\" \"I read a book (not yet complete)\" indicates present.\n\nNouns may be suffixed with the markers for the aforementioned accusative case and partitive case, the genitive case, eight different locatives, and a few other cases. The case marker must be added not only to the main noun, but also to its modifiers; e.g. \"suure+ssa talo+ssa\", literally \"big-in house-in\". Possession is marked with a possessive suffix; separate possessive pronouns are unknown. Pronouns gain suffixes just as nouns do.\n\nFinnish has a smaller core vocabulary than, for example, English, and uses derivative suffixes to a greater extent. As an example, take the word \"kirja\" \"a book\", from which one can form derivatives \"kirjain\" \"a letter\" (of the alphabet), \"kirje\" \"a piece of correspondence, a letter\", \"kirjasto\" \"a library\", \"kirjailija\" \"an author\", \"kirjallisuus\" \"literature\", \"kirjoittaa\" \"to write\", \"kirjoittaja\" \"a writer\", \"kirjuri\" \"a scribe, a clerk\", \"kirjallinen\" \"in written form\", \"kirjata\" \"to write down, register, record\", \"kirjasin\" \"a font\", and many others.\n\nHere are some of the more common such suffixes. Which of each pair is used depends on the word being suffixed in accordance with the rules of vowel harmony.\n\nVerbal derivational suffixes are extremely diverse; several frequentatives and momentanes differentiating causative, volitional-unpredictable and anticausative are found, often combined with each other, often denoting indirection. For example, \"hypätä\" \"to jump\", \"hyppiä\" \"to be jumping\", \"hypeksiä\" \"to be jumping wantonly\", \"hypäyttää\" \"to make someone jump once\", \"hyppyyttää\" \"to make someone jump repeatedly\" (or \"to boss someone around\"), \"hyppyytyttää\" \"to make someone to cause a third person to jump repeatedly\", \"hyppyytellä\" \"to, without aim, make someone jump repeatedly\", \"hypähtää\" \"to jump suddenly\" (in anticausative meaning), \"hypellä\" \"to jump around repeatedly\", \"hypiskellä\" \"to be jumping repeatedly and wantonly\". Caritives are also used in such examples as \"hyppimättä\" \"without jumping\" and \"hyppelemättä\" \"without jumping around\". The diversity and compactness of both derivation and inflectional agglutination can be illustrated with \"istahtaisinkohan\" \"I wonder if I should sit down for a while\" (from \"istua\", \"to sit, to be seated\"):\nOver the course of many centuries, the Finnish language has borrowed many words from a wide variety of languages, most from neighbouring Indo-European languages. Indeed, some estimates put the core Proto-Uralic vocabulary surviving in Finnish at only around 300 word roots. Owing to the different grammatical, phonological and phonotactic structure of the Finnish language, loanwords from Indo-European have been assimilated.\n\nIn general, the first loan words into Uralic languages seem to come from very early Indo-European languages. Later important sources have been, depending on the language, Indo-Iranian, Turkic, Baltic, Germanic, and Slavic languages. Finnic languages, including Finnish, have borrowed in particular from Baltic and Germanic languages, and to a lesser extent from Slavic and Indo-Iranian languages. Furthermore, a certain group of very basic and neutral words exists in Finnish and other Finnic languages that are absent from other Uralic languages, but without a recognizable etymology from any known language. These words are usually regarded as the last remnant of the Paleo-European language spoken in Fennoscandia before the arrival of the proto-Finnic language. Words included in this group are e.g. \"jänis\" (hare), \"musta\" (black), \"mäki\" (hill), \"saari\" (island), \"suo\" (swamp) and \"niemi\" (cape (geography)).\n\nAlso some place names, like Päijänne and Imatra, are probably from before the proto-Finnic era.\n\nOften quoted loan examples are \"kuningas\" \"king\" and \"ruhtinas\" \"sovereign prince, high ranking nobleman\" from Germanic \"*kuningaz\" and \"*druhtinaz\"—they display a remarkable tendency towards phonological conservation within the language. Another example is \"äiti\" \"mother\", from Gothic \"aiþei\", which is interesting because borrowing of close-kinship vocabulary is a rare phenomenon. The original Finnish \"emo\" occurs only in restricted contexts. There are other close-kinship words that are loaned from Baltic and Germanic languages (\"morsian\" \"bride\", \"armas\" \"dear\", \"huora\" \"whore\"). Examples of the ancient Iranian loans are \"vasara\" \"hammer\" from Avestan \"vadžra\", \"vajra\" and \"orja\" \"slave\" from \"arya\", \"airya\" \"man\" (the latter probably via similar circumstances as \"slave\" from Slav in many European languages).\n\nMore recently, Swedish has been a prolific source of borrowings, and also, the Swedish language acted as a proxy for European words, especially those relating to government. Present-day Finland was a part of Sweden from the 12th century and was ceded to Russia in 1809, becoming an autonomous Grand Duchy. Swedish was retained as the official language and language of the upper class even after this. When Finnish was accepted as an official language, it gained legal equal status with Swedish. During the period of autonomy, Russian did not gain much ground as a language of the people or the government. Nevertheless, quite a few words were subsequently acquired from Russian (especially in older Helsinki slang) but not to the same extent as with Swedish. In all these cases, borrowing has been partly a result of geographical proximity.\n\nEspecially words dealing with administrative or modern culture came to Finnish from Swedish, sometimes reflecting the oldest Swedish form of the word (\"lag\" – \"laki\", 'law'; \"län\" – \"lääni\", 'province'; \"bisp\" – \"piispa\", 'bishop'; \"jordpäron\" – \"peruna\", 'potato'), and many more survive as informal synonyms in spoken or dialectal Finnish (e.g. \"likka\", from Swedish \"flicka\", 'girl', usually \"tyttö\" in Finnish).\n\nTypical Russian loanwords are old or very old, thus hard to recognize as such, and concern everyday concepts, e.g. \"papu\" \"bean\", \"sini\" \"(n.) blue\" and \"pappi\" \"priest\". Notably, a few religious words such as \"Raamattu\" (\"Bible\") are borrowed from Russian, which indicates language contact preceding the Swedish era. This is mainly believed to be result of trade with Novgorod from the 9th century on and Russian Orthodox missions in the east in the 13th century.\n\nMost recently, and with increasing impact, English has been the source of new loanwords in Finnish. Unlike previous geographical borrowing, the influence of English is largely cultural and reaches Finland by many routes, including international business, music, film and TV (foreign films and programmes, excluding ones intended for a very young audience, are shown subtitled), literature, and the Web – the latter is now probably the most important source of all non-face-to-face exposure to English.\n\nThe importance of English as the language of global commerce has led many non-English companies, including Finland's Nokia, to adopt English as their official operating language. Recently, it has been observed that English borrowings are also ousting previous borrowings, for example the switch from \"treffailla\" \"to date\" (from Swedish, \"träffa\") to \"deittailla\" from English \"to go for a date\". Calques from English are also found, e.g. \"kovalevy\" (hard disk). Grammatical calques are also found, for example, the replacement of the impersonal (\"passiivi\") with the English-style generic you, e. g. \"sä et voi\" \"you cannot\", instead of \"ei voi\" \"one cannot\". This construct, however, is limited to colloquial language, as it is against the standard grammar.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that Finnish is threatened by English. Borrowing is normal language evolution, and neologisms are coined actively not only by the government, but also by the media. Moreover, Finnish and English have a considerably different grammar, phonology and phonotactics, discouraging direct borrowing. English loan words in Finnish slang include for example \"pleikkari\" \"PlayStation\", \"hodari\" \"hot dog\", and \"hedari\" \"headache\", \"headshot\" or \"headbutt\". Often these loanwords are distinctly identified as slang or jargon, rarely being used in a negative mood or in formal language. Since English and Finnish grammar, pronunciation and phonetics differ considerably, most loan words are inevitably sooner or later calqued – translated into native Finnish – retaining the semantic meaning.\n\nSome modern terms have been synthesised rather than borrowed, for example:\nNeologisms are actively generated by the Language Planning Office and the media. They are widely adopted. One would actually give an old-fashioned or rustic impression using forms such as \"kompuutteri (computer)\" or \"kalkulaattori (calculator)\" when the neologism is widely adopted.\n\nFinnish is written with the Swedish variant of the Latin alphabet but with two more letters that are from some Russian loanwords. It includes the distinct characters Ä and Ö, and also several characters (b, c, f, q, w, x, z, å, š and ž) reserved for words of non-Finnish origin. The Finnish orthography follows the phoneme principle: each phoneme (meaningful sound) of the language corresponds to exactly one grapheme (independent letter), and each grapheme represents almost exactly one phoneme. This enables an easy spelling and facilitates reading and writing acquisition. The rule of thumb for Finnish orthography is: \"write as you read, read as you write\". However, morphemes retain their spelling despite sandhi.\n\nSome orthographical notes:\n\nAlthough Finnish is almost completely written as it is spoken, there are a few differences:\n\nWhen the appropriate characters are not available, the graphemes \"ä\" and \"ö\" are usually converted to \"a\" and \"o\", respectively. This is common in e-mail addresses and other electronic media where there may be no support for characters outside the basic ASCII character set. Writing them as \"ae\" and \"oe\", following German usage, is rarer and usually considered incorrect, but formally used in passports and equivalent situations. Both conversion rules have minimal pairs which would no longer be distinguished from each other.\n\nThe sounds \"š\" and \"ž\" are not a part of Finnish language itself and have been introduced by the Finnish national languages body for more phonologically accurate transcription of loanwords and foreign names. For technical reasons or convenience, the graphemes \"sh\" and \"zh\" are often used in quickly or less carefully written texts instead of \"š\" and \"ž\". This is a deviation from the phonetic principle, and as such is liable to cause confusion, but the damage is minimal as the transcribed words are foreign in any case. Finnish does not use the sounds \"z\", \"š\" or \"ž\", but for the sake of exactitude, they can be included in spelling. (The recommendation cites the Russian opera \"Hovanštšina\" as an example.) Many speakers pronounce all of them \"s\", or distinguish only between \"s\" and \"š\", because Finnish has no voiced sibilants.\n\nThe language may be identified by its distinctive lack of the letters \"b, c, f, q, w, x, z\" and \"å.\"\n\n\n\n¹ -te is added to make the sentence formal (T-V distinction). Otherwise, without the added \"-te\", it is informal. It is also added when talking to more than one person. The transition from second-person singular to second-person plural (\"teitittely\") is a politeness pattern, advised by many \"good manners guides\". Elderly people, especially, expect it from strangers, whereas the younger might feel it to be too formal to the point of coldness. However, a learner of the language should not be excessively concerned about it. Omitting it is (almost) never offensive, but one should keep in mind that on formal occasions this custom may make a good impression.\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien, although better known as an author, had a keen interest in languages from a young age, and became a professional philologist. He described his first encounter with Finnish:\nAspects of Finnish were a strong influence on Quenya, one of the languages constructed by Tolkien. Within his fantasy writings set in the world of Middle-earth, Quenya is a highly-revered language.\n\n\n"}

They are usually made of grape and citrus wine, sugar, and artificial flavor. \n\n\nAn early reference to the problem of cheap and poorly made wines is in the \"Report on Cheap Wines\" in the 5 November 1864 issue of \"The Medical Times and Gazette\". The author, in prescribing inexpensive wines for a number of ills, cautions against the \"fortified\" wines of the day, describing of one sample that he had tried:\nIt is reported, however, that the popularity of cheap, fortified wines in the United States arose in the 1930s, as a product of Prohibition and the Great Depression:\n\nWhile overtaken somewhat in the low-end alcoholic drink market by sweetened malt beverages by the 1990s, the appeal of cheap fortified wines to the poor and homeless has often raised concerns:\n\nIn 2005, the Seattle City Council asked the Washington State Liquor Control Board to prohibit the sale of certain alcohol products in an impoverished \"Alcohol Impact Area\". Among the products sought to be banned were over two dozen beers, and six wines: Cisco, Gino's Premium Blend, MD 20/20, Night Train, Thunderbird, and Wild Irish Rose. The Liquor Control Board approved these restrictions on 30 August 2006. The cities of Tacoma, Washington and Spokane, Washington also followed suit in instituting \"Alcohol Impact Areas\" of their own following Seattle's example.\n\nFlavored fortified wines have appeared in numerous songs as well as other media forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlavored fortified wine inspired the Guns N' Roses song \"Nightrain\". ZZ Top (on \"Fandango!\"), Seasick Steve, (on \"I Started Out with Nothin and I Still Got Most of It Left\"), and They Might Be Giants (on \"The Spine\") have all recorded songs titled \"Thunderbird\". The latter drink has been popular since the 1950s, at which time a popular rhythm and blues lyric went: \"What's the word? Thunderbird / How's it sold? Good and cold / What's the jive? Bird's alive / What's the price? Thirty twice.\"\n\nAdditional songs in this vein include:\n\n\n"}

The variety spoken there, Costa Rican Spanish, is a form of Central American Spanish.\n\nCosta Rica is a linguistically diverse country and home to at least five living local indigenous languages spoken by the descendants of pre-Columbian peoples: Maléku, Cabécar, Bribri, Guaymí, and Buglere.\n\nImmigration has also brought people and languages from various countries around the world. Along the Atlantic Ocean in Limón Province, inhabited primarily by Afro-Caribs, an English-based creole language called Mekatelyu or Patua is spoken to varying degrees, as is English; many older Limonenses speak English as their native language. The Quakers community, who settled in Monteverde in the early 1950s, speaks an older dialect of English, using \"thou\" instead of \"you\". Costa Rican Sign Language is also spoken by the deaf community, and Costa Rican Spanish slang is known as \"pachuco\".\n\nTraditionally, Costa Rica has had no policies in favor of multiculturalism. The greatest advance in this respect came with the amendment of Article 76 of the Constitution of Costa Rica, which now states: \"Spanish is the official language of the Nation. However, the State will oversee the maintenance and cultivation of indigenous national languages.\"\n\nCurrently, in Costa Rica, there are six indigenous languages that are still used by their respective populations.

Boruca, an Isthmic Chibchan language, was formerly spoken across the southern Pacific slope while Bribri and Cabécar speakers inhabited the northern Atlantic slope. An unknown language, known only as the \"lengua de Paro\", was also spoken on the western coast of the Gulf of Nicoya.\n\nDuring the 9th century, speakers of the now-extinct Oto-Manguean language Chorotega controlled most of northeast Costa Rica. Other Mesoamerican peoples penetrated Costa Rican territory. The Nahua speakers known as Nicarao, named after their cacique of the same name, lived in enclaves in Guanacaste Province as well as near the delta of the Sixaola River, speaking a dialect closer to nuclear Nahuatl in Mexico than to the Pipil of El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, two Costa Rican indigenous languages became extinct. Térraba, a variety of the Téribe language, was spoken in the indigenous reserve of Térraba in the southeast of Puntarenas province.

Apart from it, Macedonia officially recognizes six national minority languages: Albanian, Turkish, Romani, Serbian, Bosnian, and Aromanian. The Macedonian Sign Language is the country's official sign language.\n\nAccording to the last 2002 census, Macedonia had a population of 2.022,547 citizens. 1,344,815 Macedonian citizens declared that they speak Macedonian, 507,989 citizens speak Albanian, 71,757 citizens speak Turkish, 38,528 citizens speak Roma, 6,884 citizens speak Aromanian, 24,773 citizens speak Serbian, 8.560 citizens speak Bosnian and 19,241 citizens speak other languages.\n\nThe language policy in Macedonia is regulated by the 7 Article of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia and the Law of languages. According to the national constitution:\n\nSome minority languages are co-official, along with Macedonian, in the municipalities (\"opštini\") where they are spoken by at least 20% of the municipal population. Therefore, Albanian is co-official in Tetovo, Brvenica, Vrapčište and other municipalities. Turkish is co-official in Centar Župa and Plasnica. Romani in Šuto Orizari and Aromanian in Kruševo, even though it is spoken by ~10% of the municipal population. Serbian is also co-official in Čučer-Sandevo. Bosnian is the only recognized minority language that is not official on municipal level.\n\nMacedonian (, \"makedonski jazik\") is a South Slavic language, spoken as a first language by approximately 1.4-2.5 million people principally in Macedonia and the Macedonian diaspora. It is the official language in Macedonia and a recognized minority language in parts of Albania, Romania and Serbia.\n\nStandard Macedonian was implemented as the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in 1945 and has since developed a thriving literary tradition. Most of the codification was formalized during the same period.\n\nAlbanian () is an Indo-European language spoken by over 7.3 million people world-wide, primarily in Albania and Kosovo but also in other areas of the Balkans in which there is an Albanian population, including western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, southern Serbia and Greece. Albanian is also spoken in centuries-old Albanian-based dialect speaking communities scattered in southern Greece, southern Italy, Sicily, Ukraine and the Albanian diaspora. Within Macedonia, Albanian is spoken in the North-Western and South-Western parts of the Republic.\n\nTurkish (\"Türkçe\") is the most populous of the Turkic languages, with over 70 million native speakers. Speakers are located predominantly in Turkey, with smaller groups in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, and other parts of Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia. Small Turkish-speaking communities can be found in several places in Macedonia, such as Vrapčište, Skopje and Gostivar.\n\nBalkan Romani () is one of several related languages of the Romani people, belonging to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European language family. Many varieties of Romani are divergent and sometimes considered languages of their own. The largest of these are Vlax Romani (about 900,000 speakers), Balkan Romani (700,000), Carpathian Romani (500,000) and Sinti Romani (300,000). In Macedonia Balkan Romani is spoken. Šuto Orizari is the largest Romani-speaking settlement in the country.\n\nSerbian (српски, \"srpski\") is a standardized register of the Serbo-Croatian language spoken by Serbs, mainly in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia and Macedonia. It is official in Serbia and one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is the principal language of the Serbs. Serbian is mainly spoken in the municipalities of Čučer Sandevo (~20% of the population) and Staro Nagoričane (19%).\n\nBosnian (\"bosanski\", босански) is another standardized register of Serbo-Croatian, spoken by Bosniaks. As a standardized form of the Shtokavian dialect, it is one of the three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Most of the Bosnian-speaking Macedonian citizens live in Skopje and the Municipality of Veles.\n\nAromanian (\"Limba Armãneascã\") or \"Vlach\" is an Eastern Romance language spoken in several pockets across Southeastern Europe. Its speakers are called Aromanians or \"Vlachs\" (which is an exonym in widespread use to define the communities in the Balkans). It shares many features with modern Romanian, having similar morphology and syntax, as well as a large common vocabulary inherited from Latin. An important source of dissimilarity between Romanian and Aromanian is the adstratum languages: while Romanian has been influenced to a greater extent by the Slavic languages, Aromanian has been more influenced by the Greek language, with which it has been in close contact throughout its history. The largest Aromanian-speaking community in Macedonia can be found in the town of Kruševo (~10% of the municipal population). In Macedonia, the language is known as 'Vlach' (влашки јазик, \"vlaški jazik\").\n\nThe Macedonian sign language ( or / ) is a sign language of the deaf community in Macedonia. As all sign languages, the Macedonian sign language is also based on gestures and body movements, particularly movements with the hands. The precise number of signers in Macedonia is not known, but 6,000 people request signed news on Macedonian television. The learning and the usage of the language, as well as the rights of the deaf community in Macedonia are regulated by a national law.\n\nMany people speak a foreign language. Most of the older population has knowledge of Serbo-Croatian, French or German. Russian is also well-known. Among the younger population, English is extremely common, along with knowledge of Serbo-Croatian and some German.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "204761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=204761", "title": "Northern Thai language", "text": "Northern Thai language\n\nNorthern Thai (; ), Lanna (), or Kam Mueang (Northern Thai: , , Thai: คำเมือง ) is the language of the Northern Thai people of Lanna, Thailand. It is a Thai languages that is phonotactically closely related to Lao. Northern Thai has approximately six million speakers, most of whom live in the native Northern Thailand, with a smaller community of approximately several thousand speakers in northwestern Laos.\n\nSpeakers of this language generally consider the name \"Tai Yuan\" to be pejorative. They refer to themselves and the language as \"khon mueang\" (คนเมือง, ), Lanna, or Northern Thai. The language is also sometimes referred to as \"phayap\" (พายัพ, ), \"Northwestern (speech)\".\n\nThe term Yuan is still sometimes used for Northern Thai's distinctive Tai Tham alphabet, which is closely related to the old Tai Lue alphabet and the Lao religious alphabets. The use of the \"tua mueang\", as the traditional alphabet is known, is now largely limited to Buddhist temples, where many old sermon manuscripts are still in active use. There is no active production of literature in the traditional alphabet. The modern spoken form is called Kam Muang. There is a resurgence of interest in writing it in the traditional way, but the modern pronunciation differs from that prescribed in spelling rules.\nFrom a purely genealogical standpoint, most linguists consider Northern Thai to be more closely related to Central Thai than to Lao or Isan, but the language has been heavily influenced by both Lao and Central Thai throughout history. All Southwestern Tai languages form a coherent dialect continuum of more or less mutually intelligible varieties, with few sharp dividing lines. Nevertheless, Northern Thai has today become closer to the Central Thai language. A recent research finds that the speakers of Northern Thai language (or Kham Mueang) have become so few – as most people in northern Thailand now invariably speak standard Thai – such that they now use mostly central Thai words, seasoning their speech only with \"kham mueang\" accent. \n\nThe Northern Thai language has various names in Northern Thai, Thai, and other Tai languages. \n\nThanajirawat (2018) classifies Tai Yuan into five major dialect groups based on tonal split and merger patterns. (\"See also Proto-Tai language#Tones\")\n\n\nCurrently, different scripts are used to write Northern Thai. Northern Thai is traditionally written with the Tai Tham script, which in Northern Thai is called \"tua mueang\" ( ตั๋วเมือง ) or \"tua tham\" ( ตั๋วธัมม์ ). However, native speakers are presently illiterate in the traditional script; therefore, they instead use the Thai script to write the language. In Laos, the Lao script is commonly used to write Northern Thai.\nSome problems arise when the Thai script is used to write Northern Thai. In particular, Standard Thai script cannot transcribe all Northern Thai tones. The two falling tones in Northern Thai correspond to a single falling tone in Thai. Specifically, Northern Thai has two types of falling tones: high-falling tone () and falling tone (). However, Thai lacks the distinction between the two falling tones, not having a high-falling tone (). When using Thai script to write Northern Thai tones, the distinction of the two falling tones is lost because Thai script can only indicate a low falling tone (). As an example, the tonal distinction between (ก้า ( กล้า) \"to be brave\") and (ก้า ( ค่า) \"value\") is lost when written in Thai since as only (ก้า) is permitted. Consequently, the meaning of ก้า is ambiguous as it can mean both \"to be brave\" and \"value\". Similarly, (ป้าย ( ป้าย) \"sign\") and (ป้าย ( พ่าย) \"to lose\") have the same problem and only (ป้าย) is permitted. As a result, the spelling ป้าย is ambiguous because it can mean both \"sign\" or \"to lose\". Such tonal mergence ambiguity is avoided when the language is written with the Northern Thai script.\n\nNorthern Thai consonant inventory is similar to that of Lao; both languages have the sound and lack .\n\nThere are two relatively common consonant clusters:\n\n\nThere are also several other, less frequent clusters recorded, though apparently in the process of being lost:\n\nAll plosive sounds are unreleased. Hence, final , , and sounds are pronounced as , , and respectively.\n\nThe basic vowels of the Northern Thai language are similar to those of Standard Thai. They, from front to back and close to open, are given in the following table. The top entry in every cell is the symbol from the , the second entry gives the spelling in the Thai alphabet, where a dash (–) indicates the position of the initial consonant after which the vowel is pronounced. A second dash indicates that a final consonant must follow.\n\nThe vowels each exist in long-short pairs: these are distinct phonemes forming unrelated words in Northern Thai, but usually transliterated the same: เขา (\"khao\") means \"they/them\", while ขาว (\"khao\") means \"white\".\n\nThe long-short pairs are as follows:\n\nThe basic vowels can be combined into diphthongs. For purposes of determining tone, those marked with an asterisk are sometimes classified as long:\n\nAdditionally, there are three triphthongs, all of which are long:\n\nThe following section largely concerns the Nan dialect of Northern Thai.\n\nThere are six phonemic tones in the Chiangmai dialect of Northern Thai: low-rising, mid-low, high-falling, mid-high, falling, and high rising-falling.\nThe table below presents six phonemic tones in unchecked syllables, i.e. closed syllables ending in sonorant sounds such as [m], [n], [ŋ], [w], and [j] and open syllables.\nThe table below presents four phonemic tones in checked syllables, i.e. closed syllables ending in a glottal stop [ʔ] and obstruent sounds such as [p], [t], and [k].\nThe grammar of Northern Thai is similar to those of other Tai languages. The word order is subject–verb–object, although the subject is often omitted. Just as Standard Thai, Northern Thai pronouns are selected according to the gender and relative status of speaker and audience.\n\nThere is no morphological distinction between adverbs and adjectives. Many words can be used in either function. They succeed the word which they modify, which may be a noun, verb, or another adjective or adverb. \n\nBecause adjectives can be used as complete predicates, many words used to indicate tense in verbs (see Verbs:Aspect below) may be used to describe adjectives.\n\nVerbs do not inflect. They do not change with person, tense, voice, mood, or number; nor are there any participles.\nThe passive voice is indicated by the insertion of โดน (\"don\", ) before the verb. For example:\n\nTo convey the opposite sense, a sense of having an opportunity arrive, ได้ (\"dai\", , can) is used. For example:\n\nNegation is indicated by placing บ่ (\"bor\", or not) before the verb.\n\nAspect is conveyed by aspect markers before or after the verb.\n\nAspect markers are not required.\n\nWords that indicate obligation include \"at cha\" (อาจจะ), \"na cha\" (น่าจะ), \"khuan cha\" (ควรจะ), and \"tong\" (ต้อง).\n\nActions that wherein one is busily engaged can be indicated by มัวก่า (\"mua ka\", ).\n\nWords that express one's desire to do something can by indicated by \"khai\" (ใค่) and \"kan\" (กั๊น).\n\n\"Phor tha wa\" (ผ่อท่าว่า, ) is used to give the impression or sensation of being something or having a particular quality. \n\nNorthern Thai has a number of final particles, which have different functions.\n\nSome of the most common interrogative particles are \"kor\" (ก่อ, ) and \"ka\" (กา, )\n\nSome imperative particles are แล่, จิ่ม, and เตอะ.\n\"lae\" (แล่, )\n\"chim\" (จิ่ม, )\n\"hia\" (เหีย, )\n\"toe\" (เต๊อะ, )\n\nPolite particles include คับ and เจ้า.\n\nNouns are uninflected and have no gender; there are no articles.\n\nNouns are neither singular nor plural. Some specific nouns are reduplicated to form collectives: ละอ่อน (\"la-orn\", , child) is often repeated as ละอ่อนๆ (\"la-orn la-orn\", ,) to refer to a group of children.\n\nThe word หมู่(\"mu\", ) may be used as a prefix of a noun or pronoun as a collective to pluralize or emphasise the following word. (หมู่ผม, \"mu phom\", , \"we\" (exclusive), masculine; หมู่เฮา \"mu hao\", , emphasised \"we\"; หมู่หมา \"mu ma\", , \"(the) dogs\").\n\nPlurals are expressed by adding classifiers, used as measure words (ลักษณนาม), in the form of noun-number-classifier (คูห้าคน, \"teacher five person\" for \"five teachers\").\n\nPronouns may be omitted once they have already been established in the first sentence, unless the pronoun in the following sentences is different from the first sentence. The pronoun \"you\" may also be omitted if the speaker is speaking directly to a second person. Moreover, names may replace pronouns, and they can even replace the first person singular pronoun.\nNorthern Thai shares much vocabulary with Standard Thai, especially scientific terms, which draw many prefixes and suffixes from Sanskrit and Pali, and it also has its own distinctive words. Just like Thai and Lao, Northern Thai has borrowed many loanwords from Khmer, Sanskrit, and Pali.\nThe tables below present the differences between Northern Thai and Standard Thai.\n\nUnlike Northern Thai, Standard Thai lacks palatal nasal sound (/ɲ/). Thus, the palatal nasal sound (/ɲ/) and the palatal approximant sound (/j/) in Northern Thai both correspond to the palatal approximant sound in Standard Thai:\nUnlike Northern Thai, Standard Thai lacks a high-falling tone ([˥˧]). The high falling tone ([˥˧]) and falling tone ([˥˩]) in Northern Thai both correspond to the falling tone in Standard Thai ([˥˩]).\nMany words differ from Standard Thai greatly:\n\nThere is not a straightforward correspondence between the tones of Northern and Standard Thai. It also depends on the initial consonant, as can be seen from the merged Gedney tone boxes for Standard Thai and the accent of Chiang Mai:\n\nNote that the commonalities between columns are features of the Chiang Mai accent. On the other hand, the relationships between rows are typical of Northern Thai, being found for at least for Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Phayao,\n\nNan and Prae, and extending at least to Tak and the old 6-tone accent of Tai Khuen, except that the checked syllables of Chiang Rai are more complicated.\n\nThe primary function of a tone box is etymological. However, it also serves as a summary of the rules for tone indication when the writing system is essentially etymological in that regard, as is the case with the major Tai-language writing systems using the Thai, Lanna, New Tai Lue, Lao and Tai Dam scripts.\n\nSome words differ only as a result of the regular tone correspondences:\nOther tone differences are irregular, such as:\n\nSome words differ in a single sound and associated tone. In many words, the initial ร (/r/) in Standard Thai corresponds to ฮ (/h/) in Northern Thai:\nSome aspirated consonants in the low-class consonant group (อักษรต่ำ /ʔàk.sɔ̌ːn.tàm/) in Standard Thai correspond to unaspirated sounds in Northern Thai. These sounds include ค, ช, ท, and พ (/kʰ/, /t͡ɕʰ/, /tʰ/, and /pʰ/ respectively), but sounds such as ฅ, คร, ฆ, ฒ, พร, ภ (/kʰ/, /kʰr/, /kʰ/, /tʰ/, /pʰr/, and /pʰ/ respectively) remain aspirated. Such aspirated consonants that are unaspirated in Northern Thai correspond to unaspirated voiced sounds in Proto-Tai which are *ɡ, *ɟ, *d, and *b (ค, ช, ท, and พ respectively).:\n\nBut not:\n\nThough a number of aspirated consonants in Standard Thai often correspond to unaspirated sounds in Northern Thai, when an unaspirated consonant is followed by ร (/r/) the unaspirated consonant becomes aspirated:\n\n\nNorthern Thai New Testament.

{"id": "7393509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7393509", "title": "Politeness maxims", "text": "Politeness maxims\n\nAccording to Geoffrey Leech, there is a politeness principle with conversational maxims similar to those formulated by Paul Grice. He lists six maxims: tact, generosity, approbation, modesty, agreement, and sympathy. The first and second form a pair, as do the third and the fourth. These maxims vary from culture to culture: what may be considered polite in one culture may be strange or downright rude in another.\n\nThe tact maxim states: 'Minimize the expression of beliefs which imply cost to other; maximize the expression of beliefs which imply benefit to other.' The first part of this maxim fits in with Brown and Levinson's negative politeness strategy of minimising the imposition, and the second part reflects the positive politeness strategy of attending to the hearer's interests, wants, and needs. For example:\n\nLeech's generosity maxim states: 'Minimize the expression of beliefs that express or imply benefit to self; maximize the expression of beliefs that express or imply cost to self.' Unlike the tact maxim, the maxim of generosity focuses on the speaker, and says that others should be put first instead of the self. For example:\n\nThe approbation maxim states: 'Minimize the expression of beliefs which express dispraise of other; maximize the expression of beliefs which express approval of other.' It is preferred to praise others and if this is impossible, to sidestep the issue, to give some sort of minimal response (possibly through the use of euphemisms), or to remain silent. The first part of the maxim avoids disagreement; the second part intends to make other people feel good by showing solidarity. For example:\n\nMaxim of modesty is one of the six maxims proposed by Leech (1983) in his PP (politeness principle) meaning to minimize praise or to maximize dispraise of self. The modesty maxim states: \"Minimize the expression of praise of self; maximize the expression of dispraise of self.\" For example:\n\nThe agreement maxim runs as follows: 'Minimize the expression of disagreement between self and other; maximize the expression of agreement between self and other.' It is in line with Brown and Levinson's positive politeness strategies of 'seek agreement' and 'avoid disagreement,' to which they attach great importance. However, it is not being claimed that people totally avoid disagreement. It is simply observed that they are much more direct in expressing agreement, rather than disagreement. For example:\n\nThe sympathy maxim states: 'minimize antipathy between self and other; maximize sympathy between the self and other.' This includes a small group of speech acts such as congratulation, commiseration, and expressing condolences – all of which is in accordance with Brown and Levinson's positive politeness strategy of attending to the hearer's interests, wants, and needs.

He received a good education in Metz and spoke not only French and German often but also Latin and Greek.\n\nVery early he became an Esperantist and dreamt of a better future through the diffusion of Esperanto. World War I, when he was conscripted into the German army and had to fight on the Eastern Front, was a disaster for him as a pacifist and for the Esperanto movement in general. After the war he did not remain at Metz, now again a French city, but moved to Paris, where he worked in a large banking firm until his retirement.\n\nBetween the wars he published in different periodicals, particularly in \"Literatura Mondo\", and wrote two volumes of poetry. His poetic works \"Verdkata testamento\" (\"The will of the green cat\") (1926) and \"Stranga butiko\" (\"The strange boutique\") (1931) are imaginative and humorous fantasies involving word games, characteristics also found in \"Prozo ridetanta\" (1928) (\"Smiling prose\").\n\nHis short novel \"Anni kaj Montmartre\" (\"Annie and Montmartre\", 1930) recounts the adventures of a young naîve German woman in Paris; it departs from the conventions of original Esperanto literature, in particular because of its style of writing.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935 he published the monthly satirical magazine \"La Pirato\" (\"The Pirate\"), which made him a sort of \"enfant terrible\" of the Esperanto movement, one for whom there were no secrets and for whom everything was an occasion for humour.\n\nHis masterwork, published after World War II, is \"Kiel akvo de l' rivero\" (\"Like the water of the river\"), considered as his most significant and most moving book. This is a partly autobiographical novel of a young Frenchman from the Franco-German frontier who comes to Berlin after graduation but must flee at the outbreak of war in 1914. During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany he joins the French Resistance. After the war he once more meets in Paris the woman he loved as a young man in Berlin. This classic novel about a family torn apart by two world wars is both serious and amusing.\n\nHe collaborated on \"Sennacieca Revuo,\" an annual cultural review published by Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda (World Non-National Association), writing a column titled \"Laŭ mia ridpunkto.\" The name was a portmanteau word formed from \"vidpunkto,\" (Esperanto for \"viewpoint\") and \"ridi\" (a word meaning \"to laugh\"). The column itself was written in a humorous style that included \"kalemburoj\" (puns) and \"antistrofoj\" (spoonerisms).\n\nSerious and competent in his profession, he showed an altogether different face in the Esperanto cabarets, where he created many skits, creating for Esperantists the character of a merry drunkard. Since 1881 there had been in Paris a famous cabaret known as Le Chat Noir (\"The Black Cat\"). At Montmartre, on the outskirts of Paris, he founded in December 1920 an Esperanto cabaret called \"La Verda Kato\" (\"The Green Cat\"), which he directed from 1920 to 1926, as well as \"La Bolanta Kaldrono\" (\"The Boiling Cauldron\"), which ran from 1936 to 1939. In 1949 he was joint founder of \"Tri Koboldoj\" (\"Three Imps\"), which continued in existence until 1956. His skits and books were amusing, spiritual and sometime risqué. \"If people cannot laugh at themselves, they have not grown up\" was a favourite saying of his.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Depending on the country, additional services may also be available, such as:\nThe name of this service varies from country to country, and postal services in some countries offer more than one level of service under different names (e.g., \"certified mail\" and \"registered mail\" in the U.S.). See the country-specific information below for details.\n\nTraditionally, registered mail was a manual process which gave rise to a great variety of distinctive postal markings, like handstamps, and usage of registration labels. Many countries have issued special postal stationery and postage stamps for registered mail. Earlier similar services were known as \"Money Letters\". Today, however, the registration process is largely computerized with barcode registration labels replacing the traditional analog labels having only a printed serial number.\n\nGenerally, the item is pre-paid with the normal postage rate and an additional charge known as a \"registration fee\". Upon payment of this fee the sender is given a receipt, and (usually) a unique numbered \"registration label\" is affixed to the letter. As the letter travels from post office to post office and through any sorting office, it has to be signed for on a ledger. This process is completed when the letter is delivered and the receiver signs for the item. With computerization and barcode technology, much of the logging once done manually has become simpler and leads to greater options for the sender and receiver alike to access the status of their shipment via the internet. Many postal authorities provide tracing information for registered items on their website.\n\nInternationally, the use of registered mail requires labels with a 13-digit reference number and corresponding barcode. The first two letters indicate registration (usually \"RR\") while the last 2 letters usually represent the country where the registered item was posted. \"E.g.\", RR913282511SG indicating Singapore, RB5584847749CN indicating China or RR123456785KR indicating Korea.\n\nThe earliest reference to a mail registration system dates to July 1556, during the reign of Mary Tudor, of England. In that example, \"the poste between this and the Northe should eche of them keepe a booke and entrye of every letter that he shall receive, the tyme of the deliverie thereof unto his hands with the parties names that shall bring it unto him, whose handes he shall also take to his booke, witnessing the same note to be trewe.\" This was likely for state security rather than mail security. In 1603, another Order of Council was made whereby all letters had to be recorded. This system was, in effect, a registration system, although it applied to all items sent via the post.\n\nWilliam Dockwra's 1680s London Penny Post also recorded all details on letters accepted for onward transmission, but unlike the General Post Office, gave compensation for losses.\n\nThe registration of letters as known today was introduced in 1841 in Great Britain. The letter had to be enclosed within a large sheet of green paper. The green sheet was addressed to the Post Office where the recipient lived. The green sheet was then used as a receipt and was returned to the office of origin after delivery. On 1 July 1858 the green sheet was replaced by a green silk ribbon and shortly afterwards by a green linen tape. In 1870 the tape was replaced by green string. On the introduction of postal stationery registration envelopes in 1878 the string was replaced by printed blue crossed lines. The blue crossed lines have survived on registered letters to the present day.\n\nCanada Post's \"Registered Mail\" service provides the sender with a mailing receipt, and upon delivery of the item, with the delivery date and a copy of the signature of the addressee or the addressee's representative. Registered Mail may include lettermail, documents, valuables, and literature for the blind.\n\nIsrael Post's \"Registed Mail\" service (, \"doar rashum\") provides the sender with a mailing receipt, and upon delivery of the item, the addresee must sign in order to obtain the item. The sender can monitor the item until its delivery, for items intended for 84 cities in Israel. A confirmation of delivery is sent to the sender for an additional fee. Registered Mail may include letters, postcards and printed matter.\n\nOn 25 November 2015 a preliminary reading of an amendment to Postal Law that forces the sender to mention his name on an item sent via registered mail, was passed. According to the press, the major opposition to this bill is the Courts Administration that sends most of its mail via registered mail with a confirmation of delivery, and claims that knowing the identity of the sender, many of their addressees will choose not to accept the items, thus delaying the legal proceedings they are a party to.\n\nPostNord's service \"Registered Mail\" (Swedish: \"Rekommenderad försändelse\"), often shortened as \"Rek\", will only be delivered after the recipient have verified their identity with some form of ID and their personal identity number been logged. The letter can also be collected by a representative provided this agent carries both their own ID and the recipient's ID. All \"Registered Mail\" is trackable in over 30 countries via PostNord's website and mobile app. Any domestic \"Registered Mail\" is insured for up to 10 000 SEK of the market value. International \"Registered Mail\" is insured for up to either 2 000 SEK or 10 000 SEK.\n\nThere is an optional added service called \"Personal Delivery\" (Swedish: \"Personlig utlämning\") where only the recipient can collect the letter and denies all else, including representatives and power of attorney. Another optional added service is Advice of Delivery (Swedish: \"Mottagningsbevis\") where a form signed by the receiver is sent back to the sender.\n\n\"Registered Mail\" will be delivered to one of PostNord's service points, often a supermarket, where the identity of the receiver, and any representative, can be verified and logged before handing over the letter.\n\nSince autumn 2017 Postnord no longer require signature for delivering registered mail from China Post. Registered mail from China Post is only traceable in the sense that the mailman marks the item as delivered when and if it is delivered to the recipients mailbox. No proof that the recipient has received the mail is collected. \n\nSince 1998, the \"Special Delivery\" service has been the only registered service offered by Royal Mail, after the old-style \"Registered Letter\" service was discontinued.\n\nThe United States Postal Service offers two distinct services called \"Certified Mail\" and\n\"Registered Mail\".\n\nCertified Mail allows the sender proof of mailing via a mailing receipt and, upon request electronic verification that an article was delivered or that a delivery attempt was made. Some in-transit tracking and delivery confirmation information may be provided, but there is no formal chain of custody. Certified Mail is only available for Priority Mail and First Class Mail letters mailed within the United States and its territories (including APOs and FPOs). Each piece of Certified Mail is assigned a unique label number which serves as an official record of mailing of the item by the Postal Service.\n\nU.S. certified mail began in 1955 after the idea was originated by Assistant U.S. Postmaster General Joseph Cooper. It is also acceptable to send U.S. Government classified information at the Confidential level using the Certified Mail service. Certified mail may be selected for many reasons, not just for important business mailings. It is used by anyone who needs or wishes to provide a tracking number to the receiver as proof of mailing. It also allows the receiver to track their package/envelope through the online system at usps.com using the unique tracking number provided by the mailer.\n\nCertified Mail can be done either with or without \"return receipt requested\", often called \"RRR\", which costs an additional fee. The return receipt is a green postcard-sized paper that is mailed back to the sender by the post office upon receipt by the addressee as proof of delivery. Today the USPS new Return Receipt Electronic (RRE) provides electronic proof of delivery information. When the letter reaches its final delivery destination the letter carrier captures the signature of the person that accepts the letter and the information is electronically stored. As indicated on the return receipt card, either the addressee or the addressee's \"agent\" may sign for the document.\n\nRegistered mail service is offered by the United States Postal Service as an extra service for First Class or Priority Mail shipments. Registered Mail provides end-to-end security in locked containers. Registered Mail custody records are maintained, but are not normally provided to the customer, unless a claim is filed.\n\nIn the United States, registered mail may be used to send classified material up to the Secret classified level.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "173533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173533", "title": "Romanization", "text": "Romanization\n\nRomanization or romanisation, in linguistics, is the conversion of writing from a different writing system to the Roman (Latin) script, or a system for doing so. Methods of romanization include transliteration, for representing written text, and transcription, for representing the spoken word, and combinations of both. Transcription methods can be subdivided into \"phonemic transcription\", which records the phonemes or units of semantic meaning in speech, and more strict \"phonetic transcription\", which records speech sounds with precision.\n\nThere are many consistent or standardized romanization systems. They can be classified by their characteristics. A particular system’s characteristics may make it better-suited for various, sometimes contradictory applications, including document retrieval, linguistic analysis, easy readability, faithful representation of pronunciation.\n\nIf the romanization attempts to transliterate the original script, the guiding principle is a one-to-one mapping of characters in the source language into the target script, with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader's language. For example, the Nihon-shiki romanization of Japanese allows the informed reader to reconstruct the original Japanese kana syllables with 100% accuracy, but requires additional knowledge for correct pronunciation.\n\nMost romanizations are intended to enable the casual reader who is unfamiliar with the original script to pronounce the source language reasonably accurately. Such romanizations follow the principle of phonemic transcription and attempt to render the significant sounds (phonemes) of the original as faithfully as possible in the target language. The popular Hepburn romanization of Japanese is an example of a transcriptive romanization designed for English speakers.\n\nA phonetic conversion goes one step further and attempts to depict all phones in the source language, sacrificing legibility if necessary by using characters or conventions not found in the target script. In practice such a representation almost never tries to represent \"every\" possible allophone—especially those that occur naturally due to coarticulation effects—and instead limits itself to the most significant allophonic distinctions. The International Phonetic Alphabet is the most common system of phonetic transcription.\n\nFor most language pairs, building a usable romanization involves tradeoffs between the two extremes. Pure transcriptions are generally not possible, as the source language usually contains sounds and distinctions not found in the target language, but which must be shown for the romanized form to be comprehensible. Furthermore, due to diachronic and synchronic variance no written language represents any spoken language with perfect accuracy and the vocal interpretation of a script may vary by a great degree among languages. In modern times the chain of transcription is usually spoken foreign language, written foreign language, written native language, spoken (read) native language. Reducing the number of those processes, i.e. removing one or both steps of writing, usually leads to more accurate oral articulations. In general, outside a limited audience of scholars, romanizations tend to lean more towards transcription. As an example, consider the Japanese martial art 柔術: the Nihon-shiki romanization \"zyûzyutu\" may allow someone who knows Japanese to reconstruct the kana syllables , but most native English speakers or rather readers would find it easier to guess the pronunciation from the Hepburn version, \"jūjutsu\".\n\nThe Arabic alphabet is used to write Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Pashto as well as numerous other languages in the Muslim world, particularly African and Asian languages without alphabets of their own. Romanization standards include the following:\n\nThere are romanization systems for both Modern and Ancient Greek.\n\nThe Hebrew alphabet is romanized using several standards:\n\nThe Brahmic family of abugidas is used for languages of the Indian subcontinent and south-east Asia. There is a long tradition in the west to study Sanskrit and other Indic texts in Latin transliteration. Various transliteration conventions have been used for Indic scripts since the time of Sir William Jones.\n\nHindustani is an Indo-Aryan language with extreme digraphia and diglossia resulting from the Hindi–Urdu controversy starting in the 1800s. Technically, Hindustani itself is recognized by neither the language community nor any governments. Two standardized registers, Standard Hindi and Standard Urdu, are recognized as official languages in India and Pakistan. However, in practice the situation is,\n\nThe digraphia renders any work in either script largely inaccessible to users of the other script, though otherwise Hindustani is a perfectly mutually intelligible language, essentially meaning that any kind of text-based open source collaboration is impossible among devanagari and nastaʿlīq readers.\n\nInitiated in 2011, the Hamari Boli Initiative is a full-scale open-source language planning initiative aimed at Hindustani script, style, status & lexical reform and modernization. One of primary stated objectives of Hamari Boli is to relieve Hindustani of the crippling devanagari–nastaʿlīq digraphia by way of romanization.\n\nRomanization of the Sinitic languages, particularly Mandarin, has proved a very difficult problem, although the issue is further complicated by political considerations. Because of this, many romanization tables contain Chinese characters plus one or more romanizations or Zhuyin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRomanization (or, more generally, Roman letters) is called \"rōmaji\" in Japanese. The most common systems are:\n\nWhile romanization has taken various and at times seemingly unstructured forms, some sets of rules do exist:\n\nSeveral problems with MR led to the development of the newer systems:\n\nAlmost all Languages of the Philippines (including Tagalog, Ilokano, the Bicol languages, Cebuano and other Visayan languages, Kapampangan, and the Spanish-based creole Chavacano) use the Modern Filipino Alphabet.\n\nWhen Spain colonised the Philippines in the late 16th century, the numerous languages of the Philippines were written in various scripts, such as Baybayin. These were initially promoted by the colonists but later replaced by Spanish transcriptions, which are still evident in place names and surnames. Letters such as C, Ll, and Ñ were considered Hispanic additions and removed in the \"Abakada\", an attempt at a more indigenous alphabet devised by Lope K. Santos in 1940. These were eventually superseded by the Pilipino Alphabet and by the 28-letter, Modern Filipino Alphabet, which adds Ñ and the native Ng to the standard, 26-letter Latin alphabet.\n\nWhile the Spanish language itself uses a very phonemic spelling, the romanised spelling created for Philippine languages is even more so. For example, the Spanish \"caballo\" ([kaˈβa.ʎo], \"horse\"), the same word in Tagalog is \"kabayo\" (demonstrating yeismo in the pronunciation of the Spanish \"Ll\" digraph).\n\nThai, spoken in Thailand and some areas of Laos, Burma and China, is written with its own script, probably descended from mixture of Tai–Laotian and Old Khmer, in the Brahmic family.\n\nIn English language library catalogues, bibliographies, and most academic publications, the Library of Congress transliteration method is used worldwide.\n\nIn linguistics, scientific transliteration is used for both Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets. This applies to Old Church Slavonic, as well as modern Slavic languages that use these alphabets.\n\n\nA system based on scientific transliteration and was considered official in Bulgaria since the 1970s. Since the late 1990s, Bulgarian authorities have switched to the so-called Streamlined System avoiding the use of diacritics and optimized for compatibility with English. This system became mandatory for public use with a law passed in 2009. Where the old system uses <č,š,ž,št,c,j,ă>, the new system uses <ch,sh,zh,sht,ts,y,a>.\n\nThe new Bulgarian system was endorsed for official use also by UN in 2012, and by BGN and PCGN in 2013.\n\nThere is no single universally accepted system of writing Russian using the Latin script—in fact there are a huge number of such systems: some are adjusted for a particular target language (e.g. German or French), some are designed as a librarian's transliteration, some are prescribed for Russian travellers' passports; the transcription of some names is purely traditional.   All this has resulted in great reduplication of names.   E.g. the name of the Russian composer Tchaikovsky may also be written as \"Tchaykovsky\", \"Tchajkovskij\", \"Tchaikowski\", \"Tschaikowski\", \"Czajkowski\", \"Čajkovskij\", \"Čajkovski\", \"Chajkovskij\", \"Çaykovski\", \"Chaykovsky\", \"Chaykovskiy\", \"Chaikovski\", \"Tshaikovski\", \"Tšaikovski\", \"Tsjajkovskij\" etc. Systems include:\n\nThe Latin script for Syriac was developed in the 1930s, following the state policy for minority languages of the Soviet Union, with some material published.\n\nUkrainian personal names are usually transcribed phonetically; see the main article section Conventional romanization of proper names. The Ukrainian National system is used for geographic names in Ukraine.\n\n\"See also:\" Ukrainian Latin alphabet\n\nThe chart below shows the most common phonemic transcription romanization used for several different alphabets.

Czech, Slovak and Hungarian as well as American and some Polish and Serbian linguists treat it as a distinct language (with its own ISO 639-3 code), whereas other scholars (especially in Ukraine but also Poland, Serbia and Romania) treat it as a Southwestern dialect of Ukrainian.\n\nPannonian Rusyn is spoken in Vojvodina in Serbia and part of Croatia.\n\nCarpathian Rusyn is spoken in:\n\nThe classification and identification of Rusyn is historically and politically problematic. Before World War I, Rusyns were recognized as the Ukrainians of Galicia within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, however in the Hungarian part they were recognized as Rusyns/Ruthenes. Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand had planned to recognize a Rusyn-majority area as one of the states of a planned United States of Greater Austria before his assassination. After the war, Austria-Hungary was partitioned, and Carpathian Ruthenia was appended to the new Czechoslovak state as its easternmost province. With the advent of World War II, Carpatho-Ukraine declared its independence, lasting not even one day, until its occupation and annexation by Hungary. After the war, the region was annexed by the Soviet Union as part of the Ukrainian SSR, which proceeded with an anti-ethnic assimilation program. Poland did the same, using internal exile to move all Ukrainians from the southern homelands to western areas conquered from Germany, and switch everyday language to Polish.\n\nScholars with the former Institute of Slavic and Balkan Studies in Moscow (now the Institute of Slavonic Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences) formally re-acknowledged Rusyn as a separate language in 1992, and trained specialists to study the language. These studies were financially supported by the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nUkrainian politicians do not recognise Rusyns as a separate ethnicity, regardless of Rusyn self-identification. Ukraine officially considers Rusyn a dialect of Ukrainian, related to the Hutsul dialect of Ukrainian.\n\nIt is not possible to estimate accurately the number of fluent speakers of Rusyn; however, their number is estimated in the tens of thousands.\n\nSerbia has recognized Rusyn, more precisely Pannonian Rusyn, as an official minority language. Since 1995, Rusyn has been recognized as a minority language in Slovakia, enjoying the status of an official language in municipalities where more than 20 percent of the inhabitants speak Rusyn.\n\nRusyn is listed as a protected language by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia and Romania.\n\nThere are three Rusyn standard varieties: one in Slovakia, one in Poland, and one in Vojvodina and Croatia (Pannonian Rusyn). Pannonian Rusyn was first standardised in 1923, Slovakia (Prešov) Rusyn in 1995, and Poland (Lemko) Rusyn in 2000.\nEarly grammars include Dmytrij Vyslockij's (Дмитрий Вислоцкий) \"Карпаторусский букварь (Karpatorusskij bukvar') Vanja Hunjanky\" (1931) and Metodyj Trochanovskij's \"Буквар. Перша книжечка для народных школ. (Bukvar. Perša knyžečka dlja narodnıx škol.)\" (1935).\n\nEach of the three Rusyn standard varieties has its own Cyrillic alphabet. The table below shows the alphabet of Slovakia (Prešov) Rusyn. The alphabet of the other Carpathian Rusyn standard, Lemko (Poland) Rusyn, differs from it only by lacking ё and ї. For the Pannonian Rusyn alphabet, see Pannonian Rusyn language#Writing system.\n\nUntil World War II, the letter Ѣ ѣ (їть) was used, and was pronounced or .\n\nThe Prešov Rusyn alphabet of Slovakia has 36 letters. It includes all the letters of the Ukrainian alphabet plus ё, ы, and ъ.\n\nThe Lemko Rusyn alphabet of Poland has 34 letters. It includes all the Ukrainian letters with the exception of ї, plus ы and ъ.\n\nThe Pannonian Rusyn alphabet has 32 letters, namely all the Ukrainian letters except і.\n\nThe Rusyn alphabets all place ь after я, like the Ukrainian alphabet did until 1990. The vast majority of Cyrillic alphabets place ь before э (if present), ю, and я.\n\nThe Lemko and Prešov Rusyn alphabets place ъ at the very end, while the vast majority of Cyrillic alphabets place it after щ. They also place ы before й, while the vast majority of Cyrillic alphabets place it after ш, щ (if present), and ъ (if present).\n\nIn the Prešov Rusyn alphabet, і and ї come before и, and likewise, і comes before и in the Lemko Rusyn alphabet (which doesn't have ї). In the Ukrainian alphabet, however, и precedes і and ї, and the Pannonian Rusyn alphabet (which doesn't have і) follows this precedent by placing и before ї.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1335854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1335854", "title": "Southampton, Ontario", "text": "Southampton, Ontario\n\nSouthampton is a community on the shores of Lake Huron in Bruce County, Ontario, Canada and close to Port Elgin. It is located at the mouth of the Saugeen River. The size of the town is 6.44 square kilometres. The permanent population in 2016 was 3,678 but the summer population is higher, due to cottagers and campers spending vacation time in the area.\n\nAlthough the community still has its own post office, and road signs indicating the name Southampton, it is no longer an entity, per se. In 1998, Port Elgin, Southampton and Township of Saugeen, all along the shores of Lake Huron, were amalgamated to form the Town of Port Elgin-Saugeen-Southampton. On December 17, 1998, the Province renamed the community the Town of Saugeen Shores. The primary employment categories are agriculture, small business, tourism and the Bruce Power nuclear power station which is 40 kilometres away. Southampton is a bedroom community, a retirement destination, as well as a tourist destination.\n\nLong before settlers arrived to the area, Southampton was an important trading area, according to a historic plaque erected in town by the Government of Ontario, titled Fur Trading at Saugeen:\n\nThe community was originally known as Saugeen by the early residents, by the Canadian Post Office and by Custom House Departments. However, the Crown Land Departments labelled the village as Southampton and the name stuck as the town was incorporated, named after Southampton, the English sea port. The first European settlers of the area, around 1848, were Captain John Spence and William Kennedy, who wanted to establish a fishing company.\n\nWhile it proved unfruitful, Spence became a sailor and Kennedy joined a search for the Arctic explorer, Sir John Franklin. Nevertheless, in 1851 there were at least a dozen families living in the community. In the same year, the Post Office was established, the first and only in Bruce County for several years. Three years later, a Bank of Upper Canada was built.\n\nIn 1846, \"Smith's Canadian Gazetteer\" describes Saugeen (Southampton) as little more than a pioneer settlement:\n\nThe pioneers of Southampton wanted the village to become the county town or county seat, as the village held the only Crown Land Department and Post Office in the county. However, the town of Kincardine had a larger population and seemed the strongest rival. Furthermore, Southampton did not have enough population to meet the requirements for incorporation. The town petitioned the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and the elective officials passed an exceptional Act of Incorporation on July 24, 1858 to allow the community to be considered for the county seat. Despite their efforts, Walkerton eventually won the battle.\nIn the mid-1800s, John Denny built a dam, a grist mill, a sawmill, a woolen mill and an inn on the Saugeen River. (Only the latter building remains at 484 Carlisle Street; the current dam was built in the 1970s.)\n\nThe Chantry Island Lightstation Tower was completed in April 1859, first lit on April 1, with Duncan McGregor Lambert as the first keeper. (The tower and the keeper's home have been extensively renovated and are open for tours, several days a week late May to mid-September, operated only by the Marine Heritage Society. Otherwise, access to the island is prohibited because it is a federal bird sanctuary.)\n\nRecords from 1869 indicate that the population had increased to 600. Large amount of wheat, pork and lumber were being shipped from the village. A bank agency was operating. Good roads were available to other communities. A steam ship made runs to Goderich and Collingwood in summer; stagecoaches operated in winter.\n\nSouthampton was incorporated as a town in 1904; at the time, its population was over 2400. The economic base included commercial fishing, warehousing, furniture factories, a tannery and mills.\n\nThe town built a hospital in 1947, a post office in 1952, a library in 1956, an arena in 1961 (replaced in 1977) and a new firehall in 1974.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a historically significant shipwreck was discovered on the beach. Relics of the ship, \"General Hunter,\" can be found in the Bruce County Museum.\n\nAlthough specific dates vary depending on the source, the following are excerpted from a reliable source, History of the County of Bruce, Ontario, Canada, by Norman Robertson, published in 1906.\n\n\nTourism drives the economy but the Bruce Nuclear plant in nearby Tiverton, Ontario is major employer. In 2016, the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station started a $13 billion refurbishment program in 2016 which will provide employment for many residents and maintain demand for other services. According to Bruce Power, this multi-year plan \"will generate between 1,500 and 2,500 jobs on site annually – and 18,000 across Ontario directly and indirectly – while injecting up to $4 billion annually into Ontario’s economy\".\n\nThis area of the Lake Huron shore is famous for its very long, beautiful, sand beaches and picturesque sunsets.\n\nEvery Friday night in from mid June to early September, a bagpiper plays under the \"Big Flag\" at the foot of High Street on Friday evenings, a tradition which started in the late 1990s. During the months of July and August there are \"Ghost Walks\" available every Tuesday night with Katherine Leonard & Raymond Harrison. These commence at sunset at the foot of High St at the \"Big Flag\". During the summer and early fall, the beaches are full of people who have come to see the colourful sunsets lighting up the sky over the lake. Southampton, a popular summer getaway, is close to Chantry Island, Port Elgin, Saugeen First Nation which holds a PowWow in August each year, and Sauble Beach. Every Thursday evening from early June to late August, a Cruise Nite is held; the classic cars park downtown on High St. near the lake shore. Concerts are held at Fairy Lake at least one evening per week in summer.\n\nFishing is popular in this area in the nearby Saugeen River, at Denny's Dam and in Lake Huron. The Chantry Chinook Classic Salmon Derby is held each summer, usually from about mid July to the second week of August. The contest's weigh stations are located in Saugeen Shores and in two other Lake Huron communities, Kincardine, Ontario, and Wiarton, Ontario.\n\nThe Bruce County Museum & Cultural Centre provides displays about local history and in summer especially, offers adult and children's programming and special events. These are listed in the Shoreline Beacon community newspaper. The museum has been enlarged over the years and was recently renovated. In addition to a settlers cabin, the facility houses numerous historic artifacts from the area, genealogical records, county newspapers, photographs, and municipal documents.\n\nDuring July and August, seven days a week, the S.S. Trolley shuttles passengers between downtown Port Elgin and Southampton along the roadway for a modest fee.\n\nThe Chantry Island Lightstation Tower was built in 1859; the tower, keeper's cottage, boat house and dock have been fully restored. The island is a federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary and access is prohibited except with the single licensed tour operator. From late-May to mid-September, tours of the lightstation facilities are available several times a week. They leave on the Marine Heritage Society's boat from the ticket office by the fishing boat docks at the harbour.\n\nThree other local lighthouses have been designated under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act: McNab Point and both the Front and Rear Range lights at the River Front.\n\nAfter the railways ceased to service the area, the tracks were removed and the beds were vacant and overgrown. A group of volunteers founded the Saugeen RailTrail Association in 1990, and convinced Port Elgin, Southampton and Saugeen Township to acquire sections of the then unused rail bed. Over the years, the bed has been developed as trails for walking and cycling. The trail connects Southampton and Port Elgin. The trail also connects to the 80 kilometre long Bruce County Trail Network which leads to towns such as Paisley, Walkerton, Mildmay and Kincardine.\nThe trailhead can be accessed at River Street in Port Elgin, a few blocks north of the town centre and east of Hwy 21. There are other access points in both towns, some with parking. The trail is not groomed for cross country skiing during the winter but is used frequently for that purpose. Maps of the trails are available on the web site of the Saugeen Railtrail Association.\n\nThe Town of Saugeen Shores' hospital is in Southampton, Saugeen Memorial. Many physicians' practices are at the Saugeen Shores Medical Building. The hospital is part of the Grey Bruce Health Services' network of hospitals in northern Bruce and in Grey County. According to the local Health Services department, facilities include 16 beds, a 24-hour emergency department, surgery, acute medical care and outpatient services. Other facilities include:\n\n\nThe hospital also houses other community health providers. Day surgery services are offered and include ear, nose and throat surgery.\n\nThe Town of Saugeen Shores includes senior service groups and clubs as well as aid providers and senior homes that offer full services. Relevant providers include Home and Community Support Services Grey Bruce, two assisted living residences, the Hampton Court Retirement Lodge (Southampton) and Kingsway Arms at Elgin Lodge (Port Elgin) and Southampton Care Centre long term care home. Social and other services for seniors are available at PARC 55+ (Port Elgin) and Chantry Senior Centre (Southampton).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7096219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7096219", "title": "Take point", "text": "Take point\n\nIn modern military parlance, to take point, walk point, be on point, or be a point man means to assume the first and most exposed position in a combat military formation, that is, the leading soldier or unit advancing through hostile or unsecured territory. The term can be applied to infantry or mechanized columns. The soldier, vehicle, or unit on point is frequently the first to take hostile fire. The inherent risks of taking point create a need for constant and extreme operational alertness. However, ambushes often intend to let the point element past the prime killing zone in order to be maximally effective. Point position is often rotated periodically so as not to overtax the individual soldier/unit.\n\nThe term might be related to the Middle English phrase \"in point\", which meant \"in immediate danger or peril\". The modern use of the term derives from military tactics. During a military patrol or infantry operation, the point man is a navigator who walks several meters out in front of everyone else and is likely to be the first one to encounter enemy soldiers. It is a hazardous position that requires alertness and ability to deal with unexpected attacks.\n\nThe term was used in the 19th century American Old West when the lead cowboy at the front of a herd of cattle was known as the pointer or point man. It may have come into common use because many of the cowboys in the late 1800s were veterans of the American Civil War. In cavalry terminology, the men scouting ahead of the main force were said to be \"riding point\". This use was first recorded in 1903.\n\nThe concept seems to have been introduced to the American military at West Point by Professor Dennis H. Mahan, who taught most of the top officers on both sides in the Civil War. In his \"Elementary Treatise on Advanced-Guard, Out-Post and Detachment Service of Troops (1861)\", he discussed the use of the column or V-shaped advance guard by the Greeks and Romans:\n\nIn the section on \"Advanced Guards and Advanced Posts\", Professor Mahan introduced the definition of the point man to the future American generals:\n\n\"Take point\" came into common use during World War II by American ground forces; its use continued through the Korean War, Vietnam War and Iraq War. This idiom, \"take point\" has entered the vernacular in many ways. \"Taking point\" is often used in describing pathfinding behaviors in non-military situations, or simply to mean \"lead the challenge\", often in a business context. In some cases it has replaced the idiom \"stalking horse\".\n\nMore recently (possibly originating from the late 1960s), the term has been extended to describe someone at the forefront of an issue. It can be used to refer to both the defender or the attacker of the position or idea. This use is most often used in a political context, as the point man is usually in the public eye.\n\nIn recent American youth (especially hip hop) culture, the idiom \"on point\" refers either to someone who possesses abundant and various qualities of competence, leadership or style, or to specific acts which demonstrate such qualities. Especially profound lyrics, a particular musical performance or a philosophical position might be referred to as \"on point.\" This varies somewhat from the traditional meaning of the phrase, \"directly applicable or dispositive of the matter under consideration.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6023128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6023128", "title": "Tigrinya verbs", "text": "Tigrinya verbs\n\nIn order to view the Tigrinya characters in this article, you will need a Unicode Ge'ez font, such as GF Zemen Unicode.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, Tigrinya verbs in this article are given in the usual citation form, the third person singular masculine perfect.\n\nA Tigrinya verb root consists of a set of consonants (or \"literals\"), usually three, for example, {\"sbr\"} 'break' (citation form: ሰበረ \"säbärä\"), {\"drf\"} 'sing' (citation form: ደረፈ \"däräfä\").\nEach three-consonant (or \"triliteral\") root belongs to one of three conjugation classes, conventionally known as A, B, and C, and analogous to the three conjugations of verbs in Romance languages. This division is a basic feature of Ethiopian Semitic languages.\nMost three-consonant roots are in the A class (referred to in this article as \"3A\"). In the citation form (perfect), these have no gemination and the vowel \"ä\" between both pairs of consonants. Examples are ሰበረ \"säbärä\" and ደረፈ \"däräfä\". The B class (referred to in this article as \"3B\") is distinguished by the gemination of the second consonant in all forms. Examples are ደቀሰ \"däk'k'äsä\" 'sleep' and ወሰኸ \"wässäxä\" 'add'.\nThe relatively few members of the C class (referred to in this article as \"3C\") take the vowel \"a\" between the first and second consonants. Examples are ባረኸ \"baräxä\" 'bless' and ናፈቐ \"nafäx'ä\" 'long for, miss'.\n\nTigrinya also has a significant number of four-consonant (or \"quadriliteral\") roots (referred to in this article as \"4\").\nThese fall into a single conjugation class.\nExamples are መስከረ \"mäskärä\" 'testify' and ቀልጠፈ \"k'ält'äfä\" 'hurry'.\n\nThe language also has five-consonant (or \"quinquiliteral\") roots (referred to in this article as \"5\"). Most, if not all, of these are \"defective\" in the sense described below; that is, their simplest form takes the \"tä-\" prefix. Examples are ተንቀጥቀጠ \"tä-nk'ät'k'ät'ä\" 'tremble' and ተምበርከኸ \"tä-mbärkäxä\" 'kneel'.\n\nAs is common in Semitic languages, roots containing \"laryngeal\" (that is, pharyngeal or glottal) consonants in any position or semivowels (\"y\" or \"w\") in any but first position undergo various modifications. These are dealt with below under Conjugation.\n\nEach verb root can be modified through one or more basic derivational processes. Each can be described in terms of its form and its function.\n\nChanges to the root form are of two types: prefixes and internal changes.\n\nThe prefixes are \"tä-\" and \"’a-\" or their combination. When the prefix \"tä-\" follows \"’a-\", it loses its vowel and assimilates to the following consonant (that is, the first root consonant). Without \"’a-\" its realization depends on the tense/aspect/mood of the verb.\n\nInternal changes are of two types. One is a form of reduplication. This produces an extra syllable, consisting of a copy of the second consonant from the end of the root followed by the vowel \"a\"; this syllable appears third from the end of the verb stem. A second type of internal change inserts the vowel \"a\", or replaces the existing vowel with \"a\", following the third consonant from the end of the stem. For three-consonant roots, this results in a pattern similar to that of C class verbs.\n\nThe table below shows the possible combinations of prefixes and internal changes and their functions, illustrating each with the verb {\"sbr\"} (3A).\n\nFor the most part, the two derivational prefixes signal grammatical voice; that is, they govern how the participants in the sentence map onto the roles in the event conveyed by the verb. With neither prefix, the verb is normally in voice; the subject is the agent of the event. By itself, the prefix \"tä-\" usually signals voice or voice. Some participant which is not the subject of the active sentence, the patient or recipient, becomes the subject; or the subject is both the agent and the patient or recipient of the event. By itself, the prefix \"’a-\" usually signals voice; the subject of the sentence is then a causer of the event who is not the immediate agent.\n\nReduplication with neither of the prefixes signals , the repetition of the event conveyed by the verb. Together with the prefix \"tä-\", reduplication and internal \"-a-\" both signal ; the subject, most often plural, represents both the agent and patient or recipient of the event. In English, and some other languages, the reciprocal is marked by a pronoun, 'each other'. The addition of \"’a-\" to this patterns yields the : 'cause to DO to each other'.\n\nHere are examples of the different derivational patterns, using the roots {\"sbr\"} (3A) 'break', {\"ls'y\"} (3C) 'shave', and \"sḥk\" (3A) 'laugh'. The verbs are all in the gerundive tense/aspect form.\n\nSome verb roots are defective in the sense that they must occur with either or both of the derivational prefixes. For example, from the root {\"k'mt\"'} (3B) 'sit' there are the forms \"täx'ämmät'ä\" 'sit', \"ax'ämmät'ä\" 'cause to sit, put' but no form *\"k'ämmät'ä\". Other examples: {\"ktl\"} (3B) \"täxättälä\" 'follow', {\"zrb\"} (3C) \"täzaräbä\" 'speak', {\"ggy\"} (3C) \"tägagäyä\" 'err'. Note that the \"tä-\" does not necessarily signify passive or reflexive with these verbs.\n\nThe pattern of vowels between the consonants of a verb root, as well as the gemination of one or more consonants in some cases, is determined in part by the verb class (3A, 3B, 3C, 4, 5) and the presence (or absence) of derivational morphemes (, , , etc.). But it also depends on the selection of the tense/aspect or mood.\n\nMost Semitic languages make a basic two-way distinction between a tense/aspect stem that is conjugated with suffixes and another stem that is conjugated with prefixes and, in some forms, suffixes as well.\nIn Ethiopian Semitic and in Arabic, the first, known as the perfect, is used for past tense, and the second, known as the imperfect, is used for present and sometimes future tenses.\nIn Tigrinya the bare imperfect is used mainly for the habitual present: ኩሉ መዓልቲ መስኮት ይሰብር \"kullu mä‘alti mäskot yǝsäbbǝr\" 'he breaks a window every day'. In other present and future contexts, auxiliaries are usually used along with the imperfect.\n\nEthiopian Semitic and Arabic verbs also have a third possibility, which like the imperfect is conjugated with prefixes and sometimes suffixes. This form, known as the jussive/imperative, is tenseless; it is used to express the imperative mood in the second person as well as notions such as 'let him DO', 'that he DO' in the first and third persons. In Ethiopian Semitic, the affirmative imperative drops the prefix, but the negative imperative maintains it. For example, in Tigrinya ንስበር \"nǝ-sbär\" 'let's break', ስበራ \"sǝbär-a\" 'break! (2p.f.pl.)', ኣየትስበራ \"ay-tǝ-sbär-a\" 'don't break! (2p.f.pl.)'.\n\nSome Ethiopian Semitic languages, including Tigrinya, have a fourth possibility, known (somewhat confusingly) as the gerund or gerundive, which like the perfect is conjugated with suffixes only. As in Amharic, this form in Tigrinya has a tenseless, linking function: '(after) having DONE...', '...DO and (then)...'. In Tigrinya it has an additional and very important function: it is the usual way to express the affirmative past tense in independent clauses, the perfect being restricted mainly to the past negative and to verbs preceded by subordinating conjunctions and the relativizer \"zǝ-\". Examples:\n\nTigrinya has separate suffixes, prefixes, or combinations of prefixes and suffixes for each of the ten person/number/gender combinations that are distinguished within the personal pronoun system. These are illustrated in the table below for the verb {\"flt\"'} (3A) 'know' in its form, that is, without derivational prefixes or internal changes.\n\nFor the second person jussive/imperative, the \"tǝ-\" prefix appears in parentheses because it is used only in the negative.\nNote that for verbs in the 3A class, the second consonant is geminated in the imperfect when there is no suffix.\n\nThe same subject agreement affixes appear in the various derivational patterns, but the verb stems are not predictable from the simple, stems.\n\nThe derivational prefixes \"tä-\" and \"’a-\" undergo various changes when they are preceded by subject agreement affixes. In the imperative/jussive, \"tä-\" assimilates to the first consonant of the verb root (except when there is no prefix in the affirmative imperative). In the imperfect, \"tä-\" disappears altogether, though its presence can still be detected from the pattern of vowels and gemination in the verb stem. The first person imperfect and jussive prefix \"’ǝ\" merges with a following \"’a-\", and the vowel of the other prefixes (\"tǝ\", \"yǝ\", \"nǝ\") merges with a following \"’a-\", yielding the vowel \"-ä\".\n\nThe perfect stem following \"tä-\" may lose the vowel between the second and third root consonants when the suffix begins with a vowel (ተፈልጠ \"tä-fält'-ä\" 'he was known'; ተፈለጥኩ \"tä-fälät'-ku\" 'I was known').\n\nThe table below shows forms for the verb {\"flt\"'} (3A) 'know' in each of the possible combinations of derivational prefixes and internal changes. Unless otherwise indicated, the forms given are the third person masculine plural for the pattern and the third person masculine singular for the other patterns.\n\nThe subject agreement affixes are the same for verbs in other conjugation classes, but the stems differ in some cases from what would be expected for a verb in the 3A class like \"fälät'ä\". The table below shows the third person singular masculine forms for verbs in other classes: {\"bdl\"} (3B) 'offend', {\"mrk\"} (3C) 'capture', {\"t'rt'r\"} (4) 'doubt'.\n\nVerbs whose roots contain \"laryngeal\" (pharyngeal or glottal: \"‘\", \"ḥ\", \"’\", \"h\") consonants in any position or semivowels (\"w\" or \"y\") in any position other than first deviate in various ways from the patterns shown in the tables above. For the laryngeals, most of these deviations stem from the fact that the vowel \"ä\" never occurs immediately after a laryngeal. For the semivowels, the deviations result from simplifications that occur when these consonants are preceded and followed by vowels. Some of the changes are illustrated in the following table for these seven verbs, all in the 3A class: {\"hdm\"} 'escape', {\"s‘m\"} 'kiss', {\"srḥ\"} 'do, work', {\"mwt\"} 'die', {\"ftw\"} 'like', {\"kyd\"} 'go', {\"sty\"} 'drink'. There is considerable variation in the forms; only one possibility is shown here. Third person singular masculine is given in each case, and in addition the first person singular (in the perfect) or third person masculine plural (in the imperfect) for cases where the stem changes within the paradigm.\n\nThe very common verbs {\"nbr\"} 'live, be' and {\"gbr\"} 'do' undergo simplifications in the gerundive, where the \"b\" is deleted: ነይሩ \"näyru\", ገይሩ \"gäyru\" (3p.m.sg.); ኔርካ \"nerka\", ጌርካ \"gerka\" (2p.m.sg.); etc.\n\nTigrinya has four genuinely irregular verbs: {\"bhl\"} 'say', {\"whb\"} 'give', {\"tḥz\"} 'hold', and {\"hlw\"} 'exist'. For the first three of these, which are conjugated similarly, the third personal singular masculine forms are shown in the following table. The verb of existence is discussed in a separate section.\nLike other Semitic languages, Tigrinya has object pronoun suffixes that can appear on verbs in any tense-aspect-mood.\nAs discussed under personal pronouns, there are two sets of such suffixes in the language, a set used for direct objects and a \"prepositional\" set used for dative, benefactive, locative, or adversative meanings ('to', 'for', 'against'); only one object suffix is permitted on a given verb.\n\nAs in some other Ethiopian Semitic languages, there are separate \"light\" and \"heavy\" suffixes for all but the second person and first-person plural prepositional object forms. The light suffixes (\"-ni\", \"-xa\", etc.) are characterized by initial ungeminated consonants and the heavy suffixes (\"-nni\", \"-kka\", etc.) by initial geminated consonants. For the third person direct object suffixes, there is a third form with no initial consonant at all (\"-o\", \"-a\", etc.). Roughly speaking, the light suffixes are used with verbs whose subjects are second or third person plural, the third person vowel-initial suffixes are used with verbs that have no agreement suffix, and the heavy suffixes are used in other cases. In the jussive/imperative, the vowel-initial suffixes cause the gemination of the preceding consonant. When an object suffix beginning with a consonant is added to a verb ending in a consonant (either a root or a suffix consonant), a vowel is inserted to break up the cluster, the particular vowel depending on the subject and object. The details are quite complicated; most of the possibilities are illustrated in the following table for two different object and four different subject categories, using the verb \"fälät'ä\" (3A) 'know'.\nVerbs are negated in Tigrinya with the prefix ኣይ \"ay-\" and, in independent tensed clauses, the suffix ን \"-n\". The negative prefix precedes any derivational or subject agreement prefixes, and the negative suffix follows any subject agreement or object pronoun suffixes. The first person singular imperfect and jussive prefix \"’ǝ\" is dropped following \"ay-\". The gerundive has no negative; the negative of the perfect is used instead. Examples:\n\nLike other Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has a copula ('be') and a separate verb of existence and location ('exist, be located'), neither of which is conjugated like other verbs.\nFor the present tense, both the copula and the verb of existence use forms with subject agreement suffixes rather than anything resembling the imperfect.\nThe present of the verb of existence can take conjunctive prefixes, in which case its initial \"’a\" is absorbed: እንተሎ \"ǝntällo\" 'if there is', ዘለዉ \"zälläwu\" 'which there are'.\nThe copula cannot take conjunctive prefixes; instead, forms of the regular verb ኮነ \"konä\" 'become' are used: እንተኾነ \"ǝntäxonä\" if he is, becomes', ዝኾነ \"zǝxonä\" 'which is, becomes'.\nThe perfect or gerundive of the regular verb ነበረ \"näbärä\" 'live' normally serves as the past tense of both the copula and the verb of existence: ምሳና ኣይነበረን \"mǝsana aynäbäran\" 'they (f.) weren't with us'.\nThe verbs ኮነ \"konä\", ነበረ \"näbärä\", and ሃለወ \"halläwä\" (a regular verb with restricted use meaning 'exist' and the historical source of \"allo\", etc.) replace the copula and verb of existence in other grammatical roles: ይኹኑ \"yǝxunu\" 'let them (m.) be' (jussive), ኪነብር እዩ \"kinäbbǝr ǝyyu\" 'he will be (there)' (near future), ምህላውካ \"mǝhǝllawka\" 'your (m.sg.) being (there)' (infinitive).\n\nWith object pronoun suffixes, the verb of existence conveys possession; the object represents the possessor and the subject of the verb the possessed entity. Thus there are four ways to express 'have' for a given subject, depending on the number and gender of the possessed entity: ኣሎኒ \"allo-ni\" (m.sg.), ኣላትኒ \"allat-ǝ-nni\" (f.sg.), ኣለዉኒ \"alläwu-ni\" (m.pl.), ኣለዋኒ \"alläwa-ni\" (f.pl.) 'I have'. The same form is used to express obligation; the subject takes the form of an infinitive, the subject agreement is third person masculine singular, and the object suffix represents the obliged person: ምድቃስ ኣሎኒ \"mǝdǝqqas allo-nni\", 'I have to sleep'.\n\nThe following table shows the affirmative and negative present forms of the copula and verb of existence. In the second person forms of the copula, the first vowel may be either \"ǝ\" and \"i\".\nTigrinya forms relative clauses by prefixing \"zǝ-\" to the perfect or imperfect form of a verb.\nThe irregular present of the verb of existence (ኣሎ \"’allo\", etc.) may also take the prefix, in which case it combines with the initial \"’a-\" to yield \"zä-\": ዘሎ \"zällo\" 'which exists, is located', etc.\nThe relativizing prefix precedes subject agreement, derivational, and negative prefixes.\nThe prefix undergoes the following changes immediately preceding particular prefixes.\n\nRelative clauses may occur without an explicit antecedent: ዝሰበርኩ \"zǝsäbärku\" 'what I broke', ዚብላዕ \"zibǝlla‘\" 'what is eaten'\n\nAs in other Ethiopian Semitic languages very common use of relative clauses is in cleft sentences. The main verb of the corresponding unclefted sentence is replaced by a relative clause and copula, and the relative clause often comes last in the sentence.\n\nTigrinya has a complex set of possibilities for expressing tense and\naspect distinctions\nBesides the simple perfect, imperfect, and gerundive, other possibilities consist of combinations of these three with different auxiliary verbs — the copula (እዩ \"’ǝyyu\", etc.), the present of the verb of existence (ኣሎ \"’allo\", etc.), the verb ነበረ \"näbärä\" 'live, be', the verb ኮነ \"konä\" 'become, be', and the verb ጸንሔ \"s'änḥe\" 'stay' — and sometimes with particular conjunctive prefixes such as \"kǝ-\". In most cases both the auxiliary verb and the main verb are conjugated. Some of the more common patterns are the following:\n\n"}

If the pressure is not contained during drilling operations by the column of drilling fluid, casings, wellhead, and BOP, a well blowout could occur.\n\nWhen the well has been drilled, it is completed to provide an interface with the reservoir rock and a tubular conduit for the well fluids. The surface pressure control is provided by a Christmas tree, which is installed on top of the wellhead, with isolation valves and choke equipment to control the flow of well fluids during production.\n\nWellheads are typically welded onto the first string of casing, which has been cemented in place during drilling operations, to form an integral structure of the well. In exploration wells that are later abandoned, the wellhead may be recovered for refurbishment and re-use.\n\nOffshore, where a wellhead is located on the production platform it is called a \"surface wellhead\", and if located beneath the water then it is referred to as a subsea wellhead or mudline wellhead.\n\nThe primary components of a wellhead system are:\n\nA wellhead serves numerous functions, some of which are:\n\nThe oil industry specifications for wellhead systems (materials, dimensions, test procedures and pressure ratings etc.) are :\n\nIn general well heads are five nominal ratings of wellheads: 2, 3, 5, 10 and 15 (x1000) psi working pressure. They have an operating temperature range of -50 to +250 degrees Fahrenheit. They are used in conjunction with ring type seal gaskets.\n\nIn general the yield strength of the materials range from 36000 to 75000 psi.\n\n\n"}

More recently Mithun (1999) split Southern Wintuan into a Patwin language and a Southern Patwin language, resulting in the following classification.\n\nI. Northern Wintuan\n\nII. Southern Wintuan\n\nWintu became extinct with the death of the last fluent speaker in 2003 (Golla 2011:143). Nomlaki has at least one partial speaker (as of 2010, Golla 2011:143). One speaker of Patwin (Hill Patwin dialect) remained in 2003 (Golla 2011:145). Southern Patwin, once spoken by the Suisun local tribe just northeast of San Francisco Bay, became extinct in the early 20th century and is thus poorly known (Golla 2011:146; Mithun 1999). Wintu proper is the best documented of the four Wintuan languages.\n\nPitkin (1984) estimated that the Wintuan languages were about as close to each other as the Romance languages. They may have diverged from a common tongue only 2,000 years ago. A comparative study including a reconstruction of Proto-Wintun phonology, morphology and lexicon was undertaken by Shepherd (2006).\n\nThe Wintuan family is usually considered to be a member of the hypothetical Penutian language phylum (Golla 2011:128-168) and was one of the five branches of the original \"California kernel\" of Penutian proposed by Roland B. Dixon and Alfred L. Kroeber (1913a, 1913b). However, recent studies indicate that the Wintuans independently entered California about 1,500 years ago from an earlier location somewhere in Oregon (Golla 2007:75-78). The Wintuan pronominal system closely resembles that of Klamath, while there are numerous lexical resemblances between Northern Wintuan and Alsea that appear to be loans (Golla 1997; DeLancey and Golla 1997; Liedtke 2007).\n\n</div>\n\n"}

He studied at the nearby Yeshiva of Slobodka and then lived for several years in Italy, where he attended the University of Florence and the Naval Academy at Civitavecchia. He emigrated to Palestine before the Israeli War of Independence and led recruiting efforts for the Zionist Revisionist movement. He was arrested by the British and jailed for his political activities. After Israel's independence in 1948, Kolitz became active in the state's literary and cultural life. In 2002, Kolitz died of natural causes in New York, NY.\n\nKolitz is best known for \"Yosl Rakover Talks to God,\" a short story he wrote in 1946 for a Jewish newspaper in Buenos Aires. In the story, set in the final days of the Warsaw Ghetto, a pious Jew challenges God. \"And so, my God, before I die, freed from all fear, beyond all terror, in a state of absolute inner peace and trust, I will allow myself to call you to account one last time in my life,\" the fictionalized Rakover says, adding later \"I believe in the God of Israel, even when he has done everything to make me cease to believe in him.\"\n\nA few years after it was published, the story was translated into English and Hebrew but without Kolitz's name as the author. It was passed on as an authentic testimony of the Warsaw Ghetto and ended up in several Holocaust anthologies and even as a meditation in Jewish prayer books.\n\nIt was many years before Kolitz was able to recapture his story and claim it as his own. It was later translated under his name in editions in French, Italian, German, Spanish, Danish and Swedish. In 1999, Pantheon Books published the story in a slim volume with afterwords by Paul Badde, Emmanuel Levinas and Leon Wieseltier. Dr. Levinas called it \"a text both beautiful and true, true as only fiction can be.\"\n\nWhile living in Israel in the early 1950s, Kolitz was a co-writer and co-producer of \"Hill 24 Doesn't Answer\" (1954), an Israeli War of Independence movie, which was Israel's first full-length motion picture. He later moved to the United States and was co-producer of Rolf Hochhuth's \"The Deputy\", one of the first plays to challenge the Vatican's silence during the Holocaust, which ran on Broadway, amid considerable controversy, for nine months in 1964.\n\nKolitz was co-producer of several other Broadway shows, including \"The Megilla of Itzik Manger\" (1968), and a musical, \"I'm Solomon\", an expensive flop that ran for seven performances in 1968.\n\nKolitz also wrote several works of fiction and Jewish philosophy, including \"The Tiger Beneath the Skin: Stories and Parables of the Years of Death\" (Creative Age Press, 1947), \"Survival for What?\" (The Philosophical Library, 1969), \"The Teacher: An Existential Approach to the Bible\" (Jason Aronson, 1982) and \"Confrontation: The Existential Thought of Rabbi J. B. Soloveitchik\" (Ktav, 1993).\n\nUntil a few weeks before his death, Kolitz wrote a weekly column for the Yiddish newspaper \"Algemeiner Journal\". The column appeared under his name for 32 years. He also taught courses in Jewish thought for many years at Yeshiva University.\n\n"}

It is a base for Ekavian Standard Serbian.\n\nThe dialect is mainly spoken in Serbia or more exactly in most of the province of Vojvodina, as well as in Belgrade, Mačva, Šumadija, and western Serbia. Some of the speakers could be also found in neighboring areas of Romania, Croatia and Hungary.\n\nIn the 16th century, the dialect was spoken in entire Vojvodina, as well as in some parts of present-day Hungary and Romania. During the Great Serb Migration from 1690, many speakers of the dialect were settled in the Budapest region. Most of these settlers were later assimilated. During the 18th and 19th century, the territorial distribution of the dialect was reduced due to the migrations of speakers of Hungarian language from the north and speakers of Romanian language from the east.\n\nŠumadija–Vojvodina dialect is a base for the standard Ekavian version of the Serbian literary language. It was also a base for the Serbian literary language in the 18th and 19th century, before the linguistic reform was introduced by Vuk Karadžić. During the reform, the standard variety of the dialect was adapted to be more similar to Ijekavian dialect.\n\n"}
