As \"inspiration\" had come to mean simply the gathering of a new idea, Cicero reiterated the idea of a rush of unexpected breath, a powerful force that would render the poet helpless and unaware of its origin.\n\nLiterally, the Latin means \"to blow upon/toward\". It was originally spelt , made up of (to) and (blowing/breathing), the noun form of (to blow).

{"id": "18721861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18721861", "title": "Amazonian languages", "text": "Amazonian languages\n\nAmazonian languages is the term used to refer to the indigenous languages of \"Greater Amazonia.\" This area is significantly larger than the Amazon and extends from the Atlantic coast all the way to the Andes, while its southern border is usually said to be the Paraná. The region is inhabited by societies that share many cultural traits but whose languages are characterized by great diversity. There are about 330 extant languages in Greater Amazonia, almost half of which have fewer than 500 speakers. Meanwhile, only Wayuu has greater than 100,000 speakers (about 300,000). Of the 330 total languages, about fifty are isolates, while the remaining ones belong to about 25 different families. Most of the posited families have few members. It is this distribution of many small and historically unrelated speech communities that makes Amazonia one of the most linguistically diverse regions in the world. The precise reasons for this unusual diversity have not yet been conclusively determined, but it is noteworthy that Amazonian languages seem to have had fewer than 10,000 native speakers even before the invasion of European colonists wrought havoc on the societies by which they were spoken. Despite the large-scale diversity, the long-term contact among many of the languages of Greater Amazonia has created similarities between many neighboring languages that are not genetically related. Most indigenous Amazonian people today are bilingual or even monolingual in Spanish or Portuguese, and many Amazonian languages are endangered as a result.\n\nA variety of macro-groupings have been suggested for the Amazonian languages families, like the one suggested by Joseph Greenberg; however, these theories are not widely supported. Often, similarities between languages are due to language contact rather than due to genetic relationship. This illustrates that a lack of contact between communities is not necessary to maintain linguistic diversity. A vast amount of linguistic research is presently being undertaken to better understand the relations between the languages of Greater Amazonia.\n\nOf the above-mentioned 25 or so language families, the following six are the major ones:\n\n\nMultilingualism was (and is) the norm among Amazonian Indians. In fact, the value that many inhabitants of Amazonia assign to multilingualism is sometimes seen as a reason for the longevity of the linguistic diversity in the region.\n\nThe majority of the Amazon Basin and the Orinoco are the lowlands of a tropical rainforest, rich in edible vegetables and animals. Archeologists estimate that this territory has been populated for less than 12,000 years. The entire population of the area would have arrived only a couple millennia ago. The principal source of protein is fish, supplemented by hunting pecaris, tapirs, rodents and monkeys. The domestication of plants, at first concentrated in the bitter yuca root, dates back 5,000 years. Agricultural expansion, with its version of slash and burn cultivation, began in the mountainsides of the western Andes and was brought to the majority of the main rivers in the Amazon. The villages based on hunting and gathering were pushed to the more inaccessible areas.\n\nEach linguistic group tends to share certain characteristics relative to the type of territory they occupy, the mode of production and the material culture. For example, practically all the ethnic groups of the Arawakan, Cariban, and Tupi families occupy areas of tropical rainforest, extensively use agriculture and make canoes, hammocks, and ceramics. On the other hand, the Gê ethnic groups usually live in grasslands, have little agriculture and do not make canoes, hammocks, or ceramics. Nevertheless, they have a more complex social organization. Scattered among the farming villages, in the heart of the jungle, live hunter-gatherers that belong to minor language families, such as the Nadahup, Pirahã and Guajiboan families, more or less the direct descendents of the first hunter-gatherers.\n\nSome groups, especially the agriculturally based ones, have been particularly aggressive and are prone to attack their neighbours. Nevertheless, symbiotic relations exist between different groups: for example the Tucanoans, who are agricultural based, trade with the Nadahup, who are hunter-gatherers. The latter provide animal meat from the jungle and poison obtained from fish, and in exchange receive tapioca flour from the Tucanoan plantations, as well as ceramics. Even so, the Nadahup are considered \"inferior\" by the Tucanoans and are not considered in inter-ethnic marriage as the Tucanoans do with other ethnic groups.\n\nThe Europeans invaded the region in the 16th century, quickly taking control of the coastal areas and the main rivers as far as they were navigable. The indigenous population began to drastically diminish around 1900; it is estimated that the population was only a 10th of what it had been in 1500 (estimated at between 2 and 5 million). The majority of this loss of life was involuntary, due to European diseases the native Amazonian population didn't have immunity to. The Europeans also used the native Amazonians as slaves. There are testimonies of the Europeans navigating upriver from the mouth of the Amazon, capturing entire tribes and carrying them downriver to the plantations where they worked under difficult conditions, dying in a few years. The Europeans, due to their superior weapons, were able to take whatever piece of land they wanted. Previously the incursions of the colonists were motivated by the possession of resources like rubber or certain minerals, that frequently were preceded by violent actions against the indigenous Amazonians.\n\nThe number of languages in each language is in parentheses.\n\n"}

{"id": "5317446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5317446", "title": "Anioma people", "text": "Anioma people\n\nAnioma people are located primarily in Delta State, Nigeria. They are referred to as Western Igbo, being separated from the Igbo in the east by the River Niger. They make up about one-third of Delta State and, for administrative purposes, are referred to as “Delta North,” thus contrasting Delta Central and Delta South, areas densely inhabited by the Urhobo, Isoko, Ijaw, and Itsekiri, the other ethnic groups inhabiting Delta State. The Anioma region has a total population of 1,114,055, not including those Anioma communities located outside of Delta State. \n\nThe Anioma populace make up small numbers in neighbouring Edo State, specifically in Igbanke, Ozo and Ekpon. The term “Anioma” means \"good land\" in Igbo language and coincidentally, it is an acronym derived from the four original local government areas that make up Anioma, i.e., (A) for Aniocha, (N) for Ndokwa, (I) for Ika and (O) for Oshimili, M and A being common denominators found in the original four local government areas. The coinage was made by the founding father, Chief Dennis Osadebay, in 1951 and has remained the preferred indigenous name by which the people collectively refer to themselves. Sentimentally, there are also Anioma communities in parts of certain towns in Anambra State, namely Onitsha, Ogbaru, Akwukwu Obosi, Ozobulu and Ogidi. They can also be found in the Oguta and Ndoni areas of Imo and Rivers States, respectively. Anioma people, who had one identity prior to the coming of the Europeans, were divided after they lost the Ekumeku War against the British imperialism, in 1914, after 31 years of fighting.\n\nThe Ekemeku War was the longest resistance against British imperialism in Nigeria.\n\nAnioma is located in the areas of the West Basin of River Niger, south-south within the present Delta state of Nigeria, it encompasses a land mass of about 6,300 km. In the political matters of the state, Anioma is often referred to as Delta North as against the other peoples known as the Delta South and Delta Central in the same state. Anioma is bounded on the East by Anambra State, south-east by Imo and Rivers States, south Bayelsa State, south-west by Isoko, west by Urhobo people, north-west by Edo State and north by Kogi State. Anioma may therefore be regarded as highly contiguous to very many neighbours ethnic groups. The people have drawn experiences as a result of lying contiguous to numerous other towns, communities and states which characterizes the Anioma as one of the most peaceful regions in the country. (See Kunirum Osia, Anioma Association Inc, USA, May 24, 1997)\n\nThe Federal Government of Nigeria makes a distinction between Igbo, Ukwuani and Ika on cultural grounds and delineates them the status of distinct ethnic groups, yet the respective languages form part of what is known as the Igbo language cluster. Nigerians can always refer to the constitution should the need arise. A pure dialect of the Igbo language, Enuani, and two Igboid languages, Ukwuani and Ika, are the primary indigenous languages. There are also small numbers of Olukumi, Ozzara and Igala-speaking communities.\n\nAnioma social structure is dominated by the use of lineages which are based loosely on the concept of \"uno\", \"eboh', and \"idumu\", which are major blood lineages; while \"ogbe\" and \"obodo\" are open and much more political. \"Uno\" is a small family unit comprising husband, wife, and children. The next lineage was \"Eboh\", which includes the primary or nuclear family, the daughter or son in law, and the grandparents and the grandchildren. The \"Ogbe\" is a large structure which allowed non-blood relatives; it comprises the \"Idumu\" and some outsiders and it is best classified as a quarter in terms of demographics. The maximal concept is one that looks like a small town; this is the \"Obodo\".\n\nThe Biafran war caused disaster for the people of Anioma in several ways. One was the federal recapture of the Midwestern region after it was invaded and occupied by the Biafran troops commanded by Colonel Victor Banjo on August 12, 1967. Here Biafran troops encountered the Nigerian troops attempting to take over Onitsha which also caused disaster for the people of this region. The Federal troops stationed at Umunede on the main Benin-Asaba road and pushing through Isele-Uku, finally took over the Anioma town of Asaba on 8 October 1967. The special Biafran force headed by Colonel Ogbugo Kalu which later grew into the 63 Brigade, from across the Niger moved northwards and westwards to take over other Anioma towns. Ogwashi-Uku, Ibusa and Oku were also reportedly captured with many enemy stores and equipment also found by the Biafran troops, many of these equipment which could not be brought into Biafra were destroyed. However, the Biafran Army was able to re-establish their presence once again in the region.\n\n\"Colonel Nwawo was quickly dispatched to assemble whatever troops he could find and organise them into a fighting force. While 2 Division was carrying out massive public execution of all adult males in Asaba...\" This region at the time of the Nigerian civil war was invaded and declared the \"Republic of Benin\" which lasted six weeks (8 August-20 September 1967) In essence, the Anioma region was volatile to both Biafran and Nigerian troops during the Nigerian civil war.\n\nSome of the Biafran war commanders were of Anioma origin but the most famous of them all were Colonel Joseph Oseloka \"Hannibal\" Achuzie (Retd) and Capt. Anuku, who was the commander of Biafran Navy. Achuzie was a militiaman who played active roles in the invasion of Midwestern region which included his home town, Asaba. Achuzie can again be remembered for the very active roles he played in the defense of Onitsha against series of attacking efforts made by Colonel Murtala Mohammed to take over the city and constitute threat to the Biafran bids. He was often accused of propaganda gem. There was also Colonel (Later Brigadier) Conrad Nwawo another Anioma indigene who was Administrative Officer, Biafran Army Headquarters, former Divisional commander of the Biafran Army and a one time Nigerian Defence Attache in London. Others are Major Ananaba who effectively defended the main Uzuakoli-Umuahia road which was effectively achieved, Colonel Michael Okwechime was another Division commander of the Biafran army and once the Adjutant-General. Colonel Ben Nwajei formerly of the 53 Brigade was the first commander of the 14 Division, as the commander of 53 Brigade he never lost any battle for a relatively short time. He finally captured Oguta for Biafra. He was soon removed from command of 14 Division and all military duties by Colonel Ojukwu after he lost Owerri and told some members of delegates that visited him that it was so because he had no ammunition. Ojukwu accused him of demoralizing the civilians and attached him to Civilian Fuel Directorate. There still numerous numbers of Anioma indigenes who commanded the Biafran Army.\n\nThe genocide of Anioma by Gen. Murtala Mohammed and Major Gen. Ibrahim Haruna (Retd), during the Nigerian Civil War started on the 21 of September, 1967 on the recapture of Benin City from the Biafrans sweeping large Anioma towns of Asaba, Ogwashi-Uku, Ibusa, Otutu, Ishiagu, Igbodo, Aboh and Ushisha but the massacres carried out in Asaba remains the most severe and unforgettable in which mostly helpless women, youths and children were killed in rapidity by the federal troops. It has been noted that the massacres were organized and mostly carried out under the supervision of Maj Gen Ibrahim Haruna (Retd) and the reason was that Gen Murtala Muhammed was aggrieved and suspicious of the Anioma as having aided their Igbo kinsmen to invade the Mid west.\n\nGen. Yakubu Gowon (Retd) the then Head of State would later apologize to the Igbo community, while Major-General Ibrahim Haruna, the General officer Commanding (GOC) Two Division of the Army during the Civil War while testifying at the Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission Panel aka Oputa Panel held in 2004, insistently maintained that he had no regret for the Asaba massacres in which the Igbo were killed by his troops since it was motivated by sense of duty to protect the unity of the country, he stated this under cross examination by Ohanaeze Ndiigbo group.\n\nAfter the independence of Nigeria, few Nigerian groups desired their own identity separate from forced colonial political and social institutions. The Anioma were no exception. As a wave of demand for state creation in the 1970s permeated the Nigerian political landscape, included in this movement was the yearning for Ndi-Anioma, land of the Aniomas as a separate political state for the Anioma people. This agitation gave birth to the demand of Anioma State, which though remains unrealized. In 2007, the National Assembly of Nigeria announced its willingness to allow the creation of one more State for the Igbo people, a committee to adopt a State for the Igbo was set up and led by Chief Emmnauel Iwuanyawu, this committee which failed in adopting any State for the region, threw out Anioma, stating that the creation of Anioma State would amount to an additional State for South-South region of the country. The Anioma people have renewed this agitation once again following another recent announcement by the National Assembly that seven more States may be created in the country to create balance among the various geopolitical regions in the country.Among pro Anioma Activist is Henry Ogochukwu have been promoting the creation of Anioma State through Anioma Peoples Association. Henry Ogochukwu is the President General of Anioma Peoples Association\n\nAsaba (an Anioma city) has been the capital of Delta State since the creation of the state in August 1991, by the then Military president, Gen Ibrahim Babangida (Rtd). This development continues to generate criticism from the people of the Delta south notably Professor Itsay Sagay, an Itsekiri, Dr. Temi Akporhonor and Professor Obaro Ikime backed by Urhobo Historical Society. In an article in The Guardian, August 15, 2002 Professor Itsay Sagay openly campaigned for the relocation of the state capital from the Anioma city of Asaba to the town of Warri in Delta south. This was preceded by the reaction of Dr Cyril Uchenna Gwam published in the defunct Post Express Newspaper of June 1999 and several internet forums in reaction to the publication of Obaro Ikime in which he argued amongst others that centrality factor had never been the major criteria for the location of State or Federal capitals. This was also followed by another article be Clem Okonji published in The Guardian, July 8, 2002 in which he maintained that Asaba had come to stay as the capital of Delta State. He further stressed that the peoples constituting the state are all located within the Delta region. Reactions in favour of the stay of Asaba as the capital of the state has since been supported by Henry Ogochukwu, Michael Ozah, Emeka Esogbue, Tony Odiadi, Emma Okocha and others alike. Dr. Temi Akporhonor would call for a political arrangement whereby governorship power would remain with what he termed 'The real Deltan' because according to him the capital of the state is located in the Igbo speaking town of Anioma. (Whither Delta state?, The Guardian, May 23, 2002) The strong resistance of this call has ensured that Asaba remains the state capital. Though all would unilaterally admit that a separate creation of another state from the present Delta State to constitute Anioma with the capital at Asaba, and Delta with state capital at Warri is necessary.\n\nOn November 29, 2008, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex(though, non igbo in affiliation) Igbo socio-cultural organization announced the election of Ambassador Ralph Uwechue, an Anioma indigene as its President-General to pilot its affairs for the next two years. He was nominated by Delta State branch of Ohanaeze as their consensus candidate in a resolution reached at the palace of the Asagba of Asaba after the position was zoned to Anioma, one of the seven units that make up Ohanaeze Ndigbo. But in his acceptance speech, Uwechue expressed gratitude to all and called for unity among Igbo, which is said to possess the talent to and wealth it would take to take to address national issues, while also noting that the position given to him has created confidence that the Igbo from Delta State are accepted as brothers and sisters in Ohanaeze. Finally, he promised not to disappoint Anioma people as the race is for Anioma home and abroad.\n\nAnioma has abundant oil deposits particularly in Ndokwa land, Akumazi, Umunede, Ute-okpu, Ute-erume, Ute-Ogbeje, Ekuku-Agbor, Nsukwa, Olodu, Ewulu, Idumuesah, Ejeme and other Anioma regions. Records also indicate that oil was discovered in Ubulu-Uno and Ubulu-Uku in 1958 by Shell B P Petroleum Company two years after the first discovery was made in Oloibiri now in Bayelsa state, but exploration of the oil was not carried out by the Federal Government. Anioma region is also rich in other mineral resources such as rubber.\n\nIn recent decades, a significant number of Anioma indigenes have grown resentful towards the wider Igbo community and questioned whether or not they are “truly” Igbo, with many histories of Anioma towns being allegedly re-written to showcase a non-Igbo wave of migration and ethno-linguistic background. Many claim descent from the ancient Benin Kingdom, a movement which has been garnering more and more support following the stigmatisation that followed the Nigerian Civil War. Introspection of the Igbo denial in Delta State, however, may generally reveal that it is strongest in the Ndokwa and Ika territories and weakest among the Enuani, the latter of whom inhabit the Aniocha and Oshimili local government areas. Many theories have been postulated to explain this occurrence. Of particular interest, it has been suggested that the Ika were an aboriginal Igbo clan, with later migrations of settlers from the Benin Kingdom, owing to close proximity. The absorption of Edoid-speaking ethnic groups into Ika territory may have resulted in the attendant strong influence on the aborigines, in cultural and linguistic terms, providing fertile soil for Igbo denial. The same phenomenon may apply to the Ukwuani but, by virtue of less proximity with Edo State, to a lesser extent. Although many Ika and Ukwuani people maintain distinct cultural identities, they yet speak Igbo languages. The term Igbo itself has been conceived by many as a linguistic classification, encompassing all bia-speaking clans and with ethnic identity falling secondary to linguistic designation. As earlier mentioned, they are officially recognised as distinct ethnic groups from the Igbo.\n\n\nChief Epiphany Azinge, a Professor and a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.

{"id": "3934842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3934842", "title": "Asemic writing", "text": "Asemic writing\n\nAsemic writing is a wordless open semantic form of writing. The word \"asemic\" means \"having no specific semantic content\", or \"without the smallest unit of meaning\". With the non-specificity of asemic writing there comes a vacuum of meaning, which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret. All of this is similar to the way one would deduce meaning from an abstract work of art. Where asemic writing differs from abstract art is in the asemic author's use of gestural constraint, and the retention of physical characteristics of writing such as lines and symbols. Asemic writing is a hybrid art form that fuses text and image into a unity, and then sets it free to arbitrary subjective interpretations. It may be compared to free writing or writing for its own sake, instead of writing to produce verbal context. The open nature of asemic works allows for meaning to occur across linguistic understanding; an asemic text may be \"read\" in a similar fashion regardless of the reader's natural language. Multiple meanings for the same symbolism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic writing can be polysemantic or have zero meaning, infinite meanings, or its meaning can evolve over time. Asemic works leave for the reader to decide how to translate and explore an asemic text; in this sense, the reader becomes co-creator of the asemic work.\n\nIn 1997 visual poets Tim Gaze and Jim Leftwich first applied the word \"asemic\" to name their quasi-calligraphic writing gestures. They then began to distribute them to poetry magazines both online and in print. The authors explored sub-verbal and sub-letteral forms of writing, and textual asemia as a creative option and as an intentional practice. Since the late 1990s, asemic writing has blossomed into a worldwide literary/art movement. It has especially grown in the early part of the 21st century, though there is an acknowledgement of a long and complex history, which precedes the activities of the current asemic movement, especially with regards to abstract calligraphy, wordless writing, and verbal writing damaged beyond the point of legibility. Jim Leftwich has recently stated that an asemic condition of an asemic work is an impossible goal, and that it is not possible to create an art/literary work entirely without meaning. He has begun to use the term \"pansemic\" to describe this type of work. Others such as author Travis Jeppesen have found the term \"asemic\" to be problematic because \"it seems to infer writing with no meaning.\"\n\nAsemic writing exists in many different forms. It is often created with a pen or brush, but can range from being hand drawn in the sand with a stick and documented by photography, or to works on canvas, paper, computer images, and animations. The key to asemic writing is that even though it is traditionally \"unreadable\" it still maintains a strong attractive appeal to the reader's eye. Various asemic writing includes pictograms, or ideograms the meanings of which are sometimes suggested by their shapes, though it may also flow as an abstract expressionist scribble which resembles writing but avoids words. Asemic writing, at times, exists as a conception or shadow of conventional writing practices. Reflecting writing, but not completely existing as a traditional writing system, asemic writing seeks to make the reader hover in a state between reading and looking. Asemic writing has no verbal sense, though it may have clear textual sense. Through its formatting and structure, asemic writing may suggest a type of document and, thereby, suggest a meaning. The form of art is still writing, often calligraphic in form, and either depends on a reader's sense and knowledge of writing systems for it to make sense, or can be understood through aesthetic intuition. True asemic writing occurs when the creator of the asemic piece cannot read their own asemic writing. Relative asemic writing is a natural writing system that can be read by some people but not by everyone (e.g. ciphers, wildstyle, etc.). Most asemic writing lies between these two extremes. Influences on asemic writing are illegible, invented, or primal scripts (cave paintings, doodles, children's drawings, etc.). But instead of being thought of as mimicry of preliterate expression, asemic writing may be considered to be a global postliterate style of writing that uses all forms of creativity for inspiration. Other influences on asemic writing are alien languages in science fiction, artistic languages, sigils (magick), undeciphered scripts, and graffiti. Uses for asemic writing include mental and creative idea stimulation, non-verbal communication, hoaxes, and general authorial self-expression.\n\nAsemic writing occurs in avant-garde literature and art with strong roots in the earliest forms of writing. The history of today's asemic movement stems from two Chinese calligraphers: \"crazy\" Zhang Xu, a Tang Dynasty (circa 800 CE) calligrapher who was famous for creating wild illegible calligraphy, and the younger \"drunk\" monk Huaisu who also excelled at illegible cursive calligraphy. Japanese calligraphers subsequently expanded upon Chinese abstract calligraphic expression by Hitsuzendō (the way of Zen through brush), allowing their works to move past formal presentation and \"breathe with the vitality of eternal experience\". During the 18th century the Irish author Laurence Sterne included asemic lines in his novel \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" (1759), adding the graphic device to help tell the story \"in a tolerably straight line\". In the 1920s Man Ray, who was influenced by Dada, created an early work of wordless writing with his poem \"Paris, Mai 1924\", which is nothing more than dashes on a page. Later in the 1920s, Henri Michaux, who was influenced by Asian calligraphy, Surrealism, and Automatic writing, began to create wordless works such as \"Alphabet\" (1925) and \"Narration\" (1927). Michaux referred to his calligraphic works as \"interior Gestures\". The writer and artist Wassily Kandinsky was an early precursor to asemic writing, with his linear piece \"Indian Story\" (1931) exemplifying complete textual abstraction. In the 1950s there is Brion Gysin (whose calligraphy was influenced by Arabic and Japanese calligraphy), Isidore Isou (who founded Lettrisme), Cy Twombly (a former US Army Cryptologist), and Morita Shiryū/Bokujin-kai Group (Ink Human Society) all of whom expanded writing into illegible, abstract, and wordless visual mark-making; they would help lay the foundation for asemic writers of the future. Mira Schendel was an artist from Brazil who created many illegible works over the course of her life, for example her piece \"Archaic Writing\" (1964). Mirtha Dermisache is another writer who had created asemic writing since the 1960s. Dermisache actively said that even though her graphisms have no meaning, they still retained the full rights of an autonomous work. 1971 was the year when released his work \"Écrit en prose ou L'Œuvre hypergraphique\" which contains asemic writing throughout the entire graphic novel. León Ferrari was another artist/poet who created many asemic works in the 1960s and 70s, such as \"Escritura\" (1976). 1974 saw the release of Max Ernst's work \"Maximiliana: The Illegal Practice Of Astronomy: hommage à Dorothea Tanning\"; this book is a major influence on asemic writers such as Tim Gaze, Michael Jacobson, and Derek Beaulieu. Roland Barthes was also involved with asemic writing; he titled his asemic works Contre-écritures.\n\nA modern example of asemic writing is Luigi Serafini's \"Codex Seraphinianus\" (1981). Serafini described the script of the Codex as asemic in a talk at the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles held on May 8, 2009. In the 1980s Chinese artist Xu Bing created \"Tiānshū\", or \"A Book from the Sky\" which is a work of books and hanging scrolls on which were printed 4000 hand carved meaningless characters. The 1980s also saw artist Gu Wenda begin the first of a series of projects centered on the invention of meaningless, false Chinese ideograms, depicted as if they were truly old and traditional. One exhibition of this type was held in Xi'an in 1986, featuring paintings of fake ideograms on a massive scale. Also in China, during the 1990s, an abstract calligraphy movement known as \"Calligraphy-ism\" came into existence, a leading proponent of this movement being Luo Qi. Calligraphy-ism is an aesthetic movement that aims to\ndevelop calligraphy into an abstract art. The characters do not need to retain their traditional forms or be legible as words. In Vietnam during the 2000s a calligraphy group called the Zenei Gang of Five appeared. To this group of young artists, “Wordless” means that which cannot be said, that which is both before and beyond the specificity of naming. To be without words is saying nothing and saying everything.\n\n2013 saw the release of \"An Anthology of Asemic Handwriting\" (Uitgeverij), which has over a hundred artists represented from many corners of the world. Asemic writing has also received mention and space in \"The Last Vispo Anthology: Visual Poetry 1998-2008\" (Fantagraphics, 2012). In 2011 a full issue of William Allegrezza's poetry journal \"Moria\" was focused on the participants and theory of asemic writing. Also in 2011, John Moore Williams published an asemic issue of his journal \"The Bleed.\" Other publications that cover asemic writing include Tim Gaze's \"Asemic Magazine\", Michael Jacobson's curated weblog gallery \"The New Post-Literate: A Gallery Of Asemic Writing\", Marco Giovenale's collective group blog \"Asemic Net\", and De Villo Sloan's collaboration project \"Asemic Front\". Book publishers of asemic writing include Tim Gaze's Asemic Editions, Michael Jacobson's Post-Asemic Press, and Rosaire Appel's Press Rappel. Asemic writing has appeared in books, artworks, films and on television but it has especially been distributed via the internet (such as on Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest, YouTube, Scribd, IUOMA, and Reddit). Group exhibits of asemic writing have occurred in bricks and mortar art galleries in Australia, Russia, Malta, Mexico, Spain, Italy, and the United States. More recently there have been architecture models which utilize asemic writing in the design process. Currently, there is a robot that performs asemic writing live, and there is asemic writing produced by artificial intelligence.\n\nSatu Kaikkonen, a contemporary asemic artist/writer from Finland, had this to say about asemic writing:\n\nBruce Sterling comments about asemic writing on his Wired magazine blog \"Beyond the Beyond\": \n\nFalse writing systems are artificially constructed alphabets or scripts used (sometimes within the context of a false document) to convey a degree of verisimilitude. Examples of this include alien dialogue in comic strips, animated cartoons, and graphic novels (such as Alan Moore's \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", and the \"Valérian and Laureline\" series).\nThe script in Luigi Serafini's 1981 \"Codex Seraphinianus\" was confirmed by the author to have no occult meaning. The Voynich manuscript, a mysterious work on which the \"Codex Seraphinianus\" was likely based, uses an undeciphered writing system that some speculated to be false.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the composer of \"Vande Mataram\", originally in Sanskrit \"stotra\" personifying India as a mother goddess and inspiring the activists during the Indian Independence Movement. Chattopadhyay wrote thirteen novels and many serious, serio-comic, satirical, scientific and critical treaties in Bengali. His works were widely translated into other regional languages of India as well as in English.\n\nChattopadhyay is widely regarded as a key figure in literary renaissance of Bengal as well as the broader Indian subcontinent. Some of his writings, including novels, essays and commentaries, were a breakaway from traditional verse-oriented Indian writings, and provided an inspiration for authors across India.\n\nWhen Bipin Chandra Pal decided to start a patriotic journal in August 1906, he named it \"Vande Mataram\", after Chattopadhyay's song. Lala Lajpat Rai also published a journal of the same name.\n\nChattopadhyay was born in the village Kanthalpara in the town of North 24 Parganas, Near Naihati, in an orthodox Bengali Brahmin family, the youngest of three brothers, to Yadav Chandra Chattopadhyaya and Durgadebi. His father, a government official, went on to become the Deputy Collector of Midnapur. One of his brothers, Sanjib Chandra Chattopadhyay was also a novelist and he is known for his famous book \"Palamau\". Bankim Chandra and his elder brother both had their schooling from Midnapore Collegiate School (then Governmental Zilla School), where he wrote his first poem.\n\nHe was educated at the Hooghly Mohsin College (founded by Bengali philanthropist Muhammad Mohsin) and later at Presidency College, Kolkata, graduating with a degree in Arts in 1858. He later attended the University of Calcutta and was one of the two candidates who passed the final exam to become the school's first graduates. He later obtained a degree in Law as well, in 1869.\n\nIn 1858, he was appointed a Deputy Collector (the same type of position held by his father) of Jessore. He went on to become a Deputy Magistrate, retiring from government service in 1891. His years at work were replete with incidents that brought him into conflict with the ruling British. He was, however, made a Companion in the Order of the Indian Empire in 1894.\n\nChattopadhyay's earliest publications were in Ishwar Chandra Gupta's weekly newspaper \"Sangbad Prabhakar\". Following the model of Ishwar Chandra Gupta, he began his literary career as a writer of verse. His majestic talents showed him other directions, and turned to fiction. His first attempt was a novel in Bengali submitted for a declared prize. He did not win the prize, and the novelette was never published. His first fiction to appear in print was \"Rajmohan's Wife\". It was written in English and is regarded as the first Indian novel to be written in English. He couldn't gain any praise by writing his novel in English, realizing the fact that he couldn't have a smooth literary career if he wrote in English, he turned his attention towards Bengali literature. \"Durgeshnondini\", his first Bengali romance and the first ever novel in Bengali, was published in 1865.\n\n\"Kapalkundala\" (1866) is Chattopadhyay's first major publication. The heroine of this novel, named after the mendicant woman in Bhavabhuti's \"Malatimadhava\", is modelled partly after Kalidasa's Shakuntala and partly after Shakespeare's \"Miranda\". The hero of this novel was Nabakumar. However, the partial similarities are only inferential analysis by critics, and Chattopadhyay's heroine may be completely his original. He had chosen Dariapur in Contai Subdivision as the background of this famous novel.\n\nHis next romance, \"Mrinalini\" (1869), marks his first attempt to set his story against a larger historical context. This book marks the shift from Chattopadhyay's early career, in which he was strictly a writer of romances, to a later period in which he aimed to stimulate the intellect of the Bengali speaking people and bring about a cultural renaissance of Bengali literature.\n\nChattopadhyay started publishing a monthly literary magazine \"Bangadarshan\" in April 1872, the first edition of which was filled almost entirely with his own work. The magazine carried serialised novels, stories, humorous sketches, historical and miscellaneous essays, informative articles, religious discourses, literary criticisms and reviews. \"Vishabriksha\" (The Poison Tree, 1873) is the first novel of Chattopadhyay that appeared serially in \"Bangodarshan\".\n\n\"Bangodarshan\" went out of circulation after four years. It was later revived by his brother, Sanjeeb Chandra Chattopadhyay.\n\nChattopadhyay's next major novel was \"Chandrasekhar\" (1877), which contains two largely unrelated parallel plots. Although the scene is once shifted back to eighteenth century, the novel is not historical. His next novel was \"Rajani\" (1877), which features an autobiographical plot, with a blind girl in the title role. Autobiographical plots had been used in Wilkie Collins' \"A Woman in White\", and a precedent for blind girl in a central role existed in Edward Bulwer-Lytton's Nydia in \"The Last Days of Pompeii\", though the similarities of \"Rajani\" with these publications end there.\n\nIn \"Krishnakanter Will\" (Krishnakanta's Will, 1878) Chattopadhyay produced a complex plot. It was a brilliant depiction of contemporary India and its lifestyle and corruption. In that complexity, critics saw resemblance to Western novels.\n\nOne of the many novels of Chattopadhyay that are entitled to be termed as historical fiction is \"Rajsimha\" (1881, rewritten and enlarged 1893). \"Anandamath\" (The Abbey of Bliss, 1882) is a political novel which depicts a Sannyasi (Hindu ascetic) army fighting the British soldiers. The book calls for the rise of Indian nationalism. The novel was also the source of the song Vande Mataram (I worship my Motherland for she truly is my mother) which, set to music by Rabindranath Tagore, was taken up by many Indian nationalists, and is now the National Song of India. The plot of the novel is loosely set on the Sannyasi Rebellion. He imagined untrained Sannyasi soldiers fighting and beating the highly experienced British Army; ultimately however, he accepted that the British cannot be defeated. He categorically claimed that the British are not the enemy but friends; the Muslims are the real enemy. Hence, this novel is also termed communal in nature. The novel first appeared in serial form in Bangadarshan, the literary magazine that Chattopadhyay founded in 1872. Vande Mataram became prominent during the Swadeshi movement, which was sparked by Lord Curzon's attempt to partition Bengal into a Hindu majority West and a Muslim majority East. Drawing from the Shakti tradition of Bengali Hindus, Chattopadhyay personified India as a Mother goddess, which gave the song a Hindu undertone that would prove to be problematic for some Muslims.\n\nChattopadhyay's next novel, \"Devi Chaudhurani\", was published in 1884. His final novel, \"Sitaram\" (1886), tells the story of a local Hindu lord, torn between his wife and the woman he desires but unable to attain, makes a series of blunders and takes arrogant, self-destructive decisions. Finally, he must confront his self and motivate the few loyal soldiers that stand between his estate and the Muslim \"Nabab\"s army about to take over.\n\nChattopadhyay's humorous sketches are his best known works other than his novels. \"Kamalakanter Daptar\" (From the Desk of Kamalakanta, 1875; enlarged as \"Kamalakanta\", 1885) contains half humorous and half serious sketches. Kamalakanta is an opium-addict, similar to De Quincey's \"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater\", but Bankim Chandra goes much beyond with his deft handling of sarcastic, political messages that Kamalakanta delivers.\n\nChattopadhyay's commentary on the Gita was published eight years after his death and contained his comments up to the 19th Verse of Chapter 4. Through this work, he attempted to reassure Hindus who were increasingly being exposed to Western ideas. His belief was, that there was \"No serious hope of progress in India except in Hinduism-reformed, regenerated and purified\". He wrote an extensive commentary on two verses in particular - 2.12 and 2.13 - which deal with the immortality of the soul and its reincarnation\n\nCritics, like Pramathnath Bishi, consider Chattopadhyay as the best novelist in Bangla literature. Their belief is that few writers in world literature have excelled in both philosophy and art as Bankim has done. They have felt that in a colonised nation Bankim could not overlook politics. He was one of the first intellectuals who wrote in a British colony, accepting and rejecting the status at the same time. Bishi also rejects the division of Bankim in 'Bankim the artist' and 'Bankim the moralist' – for Bankim must be read as a whole. The artist in Bankim cannot be understood unless you understand him as a moralist and vice versa.\n\nChattopadhyay was married at eleven. He had a son with his first wife, who died in 1859. He later married Rajalakshmi Devi with whom he had three daughters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChattopadhyay's first novel was an English one, Rajmohan's Wife and he also started writing his religious and philosophical essays in English.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17837331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17837331", "title": "Corrected d-exponent", "text": "Corrected d-exponent\n\nThe Corrected d-exponent, also known as cd-exponent or more correctly dc-exponent (d-exponent) as used in mud logging and formation pore pressure analysis in the oil industry, is an extrapolation of certain drilling parameters to estimate a pressure gradient for pore pressure evaluation while drilling. Normally this is done in over-pressured zones, but most mud logging contracts require it to be done at all times. It is regarded as one of the best tools for pore pressure evaluation. See mud log for an example of the corrected d-exponent plotted on a mud log. The parameter is an extension (\"correction\", hence the \"\" notation) to the d-exponent method previously used for estimating formation pore pressures. The extension consists of a correction for the mud weight in use, compared to \"standard\" mud for the region.\n\nThe parameters used to calculate d-exponent values are: drilling rate (ROP), rotary speed, weight on bit, bit diameter and mud weight; it is plotted against drilled depth.\n\nAs a drill bit bores into rock, it will gradually encounter denser formations and therefore slower rates of penetration. (Though there are exceptions such as sands that normally drill faster, or faulted and uplifted formations). The general trend is normally a gradually slowing \"rate of penetration\".\n\nSands may have above them an impermeable layer of formation, normally shale, that may be hundreds of metres thick. When gas or fluids migrate up through the sand and reach this impermeable layer, pressure may build up in the sand and push up against the impermeable layer of shale. Over time the pressure can becomes so great that it begins to fracture the shale, making it weaker and easier to penetrate by a drill bit. When a hole is drilled down towards this sand, it will gradually begin to experience faster \"rates of penetration\" as it drills through this shale gets closer to the high-pressure sand. It is this trend that the dc-exponent exposes. An examination of the fractured shale that is being drilled will reveal increasingly larger concave pieces. This is where the term pressure shale comes from.\n\nThe basic drillability exponent was published in 1966 by Jorden & Shirley relating the action of tricone bit teeth to an inherent characteristic of the rock, the \"drillability\", or 'd' :\n\nd = log(R/60N)/log(12W/10D)\n\nwhere :\nR=ROP (ft/hr) N=RPM (rev/min) W=WOB (lbs) D=bit size (ins)\n\nIn 1971, Rehm and McClendon (1971) defined the corrected d exponent to account for changes in mud weight where d-exponent is defined as\n\nd-exponent = MW1/MW2 * \"d\"\n\nand where :\n\ndc = modified d exponent ; MW1 = normal pressure gradient ; MW2 = mud weight (preferably ECD)\nECD, Equivalent circulating density is the hydrodynamic pressure experienced at the cutting face of the bit due to the combination of mud density, fluid viscosity, borehole wall friction and cuttings load act to increase the pressure. This can be estimated by calculations, but it has become common in recent years to use a direct-measuring annulus probe in the MWD tools string (if there is one).\n\nAs with all matters relating to pore pressure analysis, the method cannot be applied blindly. In particular, models and constants need to be adjusted to the particular basin being drilled. The method was developed for the delta of the Mississippi/ Missouri river system in the United States, and works reasonably well there. However, basins with different sediment sources cannot be assumed to have the same compaction profiles (because they may have different depositional clay mineralogy). Basins with different pore fluid chemistry will have differing hydrostatic pressure profiles, leading to different d-exponent profiles. The presence of post-depositional carbonate cements in mudrocks will make formations appear abnormally hard to drill. In particular, the use of PDC-type bits with a shearing cutting action (instead of the chipping action that Jorden & Shirley (1966) assumed in their chip-holddown model) will lead to d-exponent plots that differ from tricone or bi-cone bits in the same formations.\nWhile doing wildcat exploration work in a region, the method can be applied \"by the book\", but after drilling the first well, one would need to carefully re-evaluate the data collected to try to improve the model for the particular basin in question.\nWhile it can be used successfully, one must always validate the information presented by d-exponent plots by examining multiple other pore pressure indicators.\n\nReference: Jorden, J.R. and Shirley, O.J.: \"Application of Drilling Performance Data to Overpressure Detection\", Journal of Petroleum Technology, p1387-1394, Vol.18, No.11, Nov 1966.\n"}

{"id": "429326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429326", "title": "Demotic Greek", "text": "Demotic Greek\n\nDemotic Greek (, \"dimotikí glóssa\" , \"language of the people\") or dimotiki (, \"dimotikí\"), is the modern vernacular form of the Greek language. The term has been in use since 1818. \"Demotic\" refers particularly to the form of the language that evolved naturally from Ancient Greek, in opposition to the artificially archaic Katharevousa, which was the official standard until 1976. The two complemented each other in a typical example of diglossia until the resolution of the Greek language question in favour of Demotic.\n\nDemotic Greek differs from varieties of Ancient Greek and learned forms inherited from the same in several important ways. Syntactically, it favors parataxis over subordination. It also heavily employs redundancy, such as (\"small little girl\") and (\"he went back to sleep again\"). Somewhat in connection with this, Demotic employs the diminutive with great frequency, to the point that many Demotic forms are in effect neuter diminutives of ancient words, especially irregular ones, e.g. or (\"island\") from ancient (\"island\").\n\nGreek noun declensions underwent considerable alteration, with irregular and less productive forms being gradually replaced by more regular forms based on the old one: (\"man\") for ancient . Another feature was the merging of classical accusative and nominative forms, distinguishing them only by their definite articles, which continued to be declined as in Ancient Greek. This was especially common with nouns of the third declension, such as (\"hometown\", \"fatherland\") which became nominative , accusative in Demotic. Another feature of the evolution of Demotic was the near-extinction of the genitive plural, which was revived in Katharevousa and is now productive again in Demotic.\n\nA derivative feature of this regularisation of noun forms in Demotic is that the words of most native vocabulary end in a vowel, or in a very restricted set of consonants: \"s\" and \"n\" (). Exceptions are foreign loans like (\"bar\"), and learned forms (from Ancient Greek , \"water\"), and exclamations like (\"ach!\", \"oh!\") Many dialects go so far as to append the vowel -\"e\" () to third-person verb forms: instead of (\"they write\"). Word-final consonant clusters are also rare, again mainly occurring in learned discourse and via foreign loans: (\"coal\" – scientific) and (\"boxing\" – sport).\n\nIndirect object is usually expressed by with the accusative where Ancient Greek had for accusative of motion toward; bare is used without the article to express indefiniteness duration of time, or contracted with the definite article for definiteness especially with regard to place where or motion toward; or with the genitive, especially with regard to means or instrument. Using one noun with an unmarked accusative article-noun phrase followed by contracted with the definite article of a second noun distinguishes between definite direct and indirect objects, whether real or figurative, e.g. «» or «...» (lit. \"I put my hand upon the Gospel\" or \"...in the fire\", i.e. \"I swear it's true\", \"I'm sure of it\"). By contrast, Katharevousa continued to employ the ancestral form, , in place of .\n\nThe verb system inherited from Ancient Greek gradually evolved, with the old future, perfect and pluperfect tenses gradually disappearing; they were replaced with conjugated forms of the verb (\"I have\") to denote these tenses instead. The future tenses and the subjunctive and optative moods, and eventually the infinitive, were replaced by the modal/tense auxiliaries and used with new simplified and fused future/subjunctive forms. In contrast to this, Katharevousa employed older perfective forms and infinitives that had been for the most part lost in the spoken language, but in other cases it employed the same aorist or perfective forms as the spoken language, but preferred an archaizing form of the present indicative, e.g. for Demotic (\"I hide\"), which both have the same aorist form .\n\nDemotic Greek also borrowed a significant number of words from other languages such as Italian and Turkish, something which katharevousa avoided.\n\nDemotic is often thought to be the same as the Modern Greek language, but these two terms are not completely synonymous. Although Demotic is a term applied to the naturally evolved colloquial language of the Greeks, the Modern Greek language of today (Standard Modern Greek; ) is more like a fusion of Demotic and Katharevousa. It is not wrong to call the spoken language of today Demotic, but such a terminology ignores the fact that Modern Greek contains—especially in a written or official form—numerous words, grammatical forms and phonetical features that did not exist in colloquial speech and only entered the language through its archaic variety. Besides, even the most archaic forms of Katharevousa were never thought of as Ancient Greek, but were always called \"Modern Greek\", so that the phrase \"Modern Greek\" applies to \"Demotic\", \"Standard Modern Greek\", and even \"Katharevousa\".\n\nThe following examples are intended to demonstrate Katharevousa's features in Modern Greek. They were not present in traditional Demotic and only entered the modern language through Katharevousa (sometimes as neologisms), where they are used mostly in writing (for instance, in newspapers), but also orally, especially words and fixed expressions are both understood and actively used also by non-educated speakers. In some cases, the Demotic form is used for literal or practical meanings, while the \"Katharevousa\" is used for figurative or specialized meanings: e.g. for the wing or feather of a bird, but for the wing of a building or airplane or arm of an organisation.\n\nSpecial dative forms:\n\n\nModern Greek features many letter combinations that were avoided in classical Demotic:\n\nNative Greek speakers often make mistakes in these \"educated\" aspects of their language; one can often see mistakes like instead of (\"I've been promoted\"), instead of (\"\"), instead of (\"the interesting person\"), instead of (\"the interesting women\"), instead of (\"the vote\"). However, the educated ones do not make mistakes often.\n\nOne of the most radical proponents of a language that was to be cleansed of all \"educated\" elements was Giannis Psycharis, who lived in France and gained fame through his work \"My Voyage\" (\"\", 1888). Not only did Psycharis propagate the exclusive use of the naturally grown colloquial language, but he actually opted for simplifying the morphology of Katharevousa forms prescription.\n\nFor instance, Psycharis proposed to change the form of the neuter noun gen. (=\"light\") into (gen. ). Such radical forms had occasional precedent in Renaissance attempts to write in Demotic, and reflected Psycharis' linguistic training as a Neogrammarian, mistrusting the possibility of exceptions in linguistic evolution. Moreover, Psycharis also advocated spelling reform, which would have meant abolishing the six different ways to write the vowel /i/ and all instances of double consonants. Therefore, he wrote his own name as , instead of .\n\nThe standard form of Demotic that developed over the next few decades made more compromises with Katharevousa (as is reflected in the contemporary standard), and despite acrimony between the \"psycharist\" () radicals and the moderates, the radical strand was ultimately marginalised. When Demotic was made official in 1976, the legislation stated that the Demotic used would be \"without extremist and dialectal forms\"—the \"extremism\" being a reference to Psycharis' forms.\n"}
{"id": "16991003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16991003", "title": "English post-Reformation oaths", "text": "English post-Reformation oaths\n\nThe English Protestant Reformation was imposed by the English Crown, and submission to its essential points was exacted by the State with post-Reformation oaths. With some solemnity, by oath, test, or formal declaration, English churchmen and others were required to assent to the religious changes, starting in the sixteenth century and continuing for more than 250 years.\n\nThis oath was imposed in March 1534 (26 Henry VIII, c. 1). The title \"Supreme Head\" had first been introduced by Henry VIII into a decree of Convocation, 11 February 1531; and had been resisted by the clergy. Though it did not as yet have any religious significance, and might be a matter of compliment only, it might, they feared, receive another interpretation later. But acting under the advice of John Fisher, Warham, and others, they submitted after adding the conditional phrase, \"quantum per legem Dei licet\". Two years later a change had taken place, which had previously seemed inconceivable. The king had actually broken with the pope, and Parliament had enacted that the king should be \"taken, accepted and reputed the only supreme head on Earth of the church of England\" by every one of his subjects. But no formula for the oath was laid down in the Act, and great differences seem to have prevailed in practice. Many long \"acknowledgments of supremacy\" are extant but it would seem that most people were only asked to swear to the Succession, that is to the king's marriage with Anne Boleyn, which the pope condemned, and which therefore involved the supremacy, though the form of the Oath of Succession preserved in The Lords' Journals, refers to the supremacy only lightly. We do not know what was its form, when Fisher and Thomas More refused to sign it. They were ready to accept the succession of Anne Boleyn's children, but refused the supremacy.\n\nThe Act of Supremacy was repealed in 1554 by Queen Mary (1 Ph. and M. c. 8) and revived by Elizabeth in 1559 (1 Eliz. c. 1). The formula then adopted ran:\n\nThis was not to be proposed at once to every one; but was to be taken by the clergy, and by all holding office under the Crown; by others, when asked. This moderation in exacting the oath helped to prevent an outcry against it, and enabled the Government to deal with the recalcitrant in detail. Many years elapsed, for instance, before it was imposed on the graduates of the universities. The last laws passed by Elizabeth against Catholics (1592-3) enjoined a new test for Recusants (35 Eliz. c. 2). It comprised (1) A confession of \"grievous offence against God in contemning her Majesty's Government\"; (2) Royal Supremacy; (3) A clause against dispensations and dissimulations, perhaps the first of its sort in oaths of this class.\n\nElizabeth's \"settlement of religion\" (see Elizabethan Religious Settlement) had included compromise with the Puritan party, as they were to become, and they were not in love with the supremacy. An informal test was used, asking the suspected person whether he would fight against the pope, if he sent an army to restore Catholicism. The Catholics called this the \"bloody question\". There was no law to enforce an answer, there was no specific penalty for refusal.\n\nTowards the end of Elizabeth's reign, a split began in the Catholic ranks on this subject. Some of the priests who had joined in the Archpriest Controversy and Appeal against the archpriest George Blackwell had afterwards presented to Elizabeth a \"Protestation of Allegiance\". Declarations of loyalty there had been before in plenty: those made by the martyrs being often extraordinarily touching. But the signatories of 1603, perhaps stimulated by the Cisalpine ideas, for the Protestation was drawn up in Paris, besides protesting their loyalty, went on to withhold from the pope any possible exercise of the deposing power. Before this, Catholic loyalists had only denied the validity of the deposition pronounced by Pius V.\n\nWhen the Puritan party had gained the upper hand during the civil wars, the exaction of the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance fell into desuetude, and they were repealed by the Act of February, 1650, and their place taken by an \"engagement of allegiance\" to the Commonwealth. An \"Oath of Abjuration was passed 19 August 1643, and afterwards, in 1656, reissued.\n\nEveryone was to be \"adjudged a Papist\" who refused this oath, and the consequent penalties began with the confiscation of two thirds of the recusant's goods, and went on to deprive him of almost every civic right. In practice the enactments were sparingly enforced. They checked the gallicanizing party among the English Catholics, which had at first been ready to offer forms of submission similar to the old oath of Allegiance, which is stated (Reusch, 335) to have been condemned anew about this time by Innocent X. The chief writer on the Catholic side was the lawyer John Austin, who generally used the pseudonym William Birchley. The oath was also used against Quakers who refused any oath.\n\n(Also known as the \"Declaration of Attestation Oath\".) The first Parliament after the Restoration revived the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, which were taken on 14 July 1660. The Catholics in England being at first in some favour at Court, managed, as a rule, to escape taking it. In Ireland the old controversy was revived through an address to the Crown, called \"The Irish Remonstrance\", which emphasized the principles of the condemned Oath of Allegiance. It had been drawn up by a Capuchin friar (who afterwards left the order), called Peter Valesius Walsh, who published many books in its defence, which publications were eventually placed on the Index. After the conversion of James, then Duke of York, the jealousy of the Protestant party increased, and in 1672 a Test Act was carried by Shaftesbury, which compelled all holders of office under the Crown to make a short \"Declaration against Transubstantiation\", viz., to swear that \"there is not any transubstantiation in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, . . . at or after the consecration thereof by any person whatsoever\" (25 Chas. II, c. 2). This test was effective: James resigned his post of Lord High Admiral. But when the country and the Parliament had gone mad over Oates's plot (named for Titus Oates), 1678, a much longer and more insulting test was devised, which added a further clause that \"The invocation of the virgin Mary, or any Saint and the Sacrifice of the Mass . . . are superstitious and idolatrous . . . and that I make this declaration without any evasion, equivocation, or mental reservation whatsoever, and without any dispensation already granted me by the pope, &c., &c. (30 Chas. II, ii. 1). In modern times, the formula has become notorious (as we shall see) under the title of \"the King's Declaration\". At the time it was appointed for office holders and the members of both Houses, except the Duke of York. On the death of Charles, James II succeeded, and he would no doubt have gladly abolished the anti-Catholic oaths altogether. But he never had the opportunity of bringing the project before Parliament. Of the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance we hear less in this reign, but the Test was the subject of constant discussion, for its form and scope had been expressly intended to hamper a reform such as James was instituting. He freed himself, however, more or less from it by the Dispensing Power, especially after the declaration of the judges, June, 1686, that it was contrary to the principles of the constitution to prevent the Crown from using the services of any of its subjects when they were needed. But the Revolution of 1688 quickly brought the Test back into greater vogue than ever. The first Parliament summoned after the triumph of William of Orange added a clause to the Bill of Rights, which was then passed, by which the Sovereign was himself to take the Declaration (1 W. & M., sess. 1, c. 8). By this unworthy device no Catholic could ever be admitted to accept the new regime, without renouncing his faith. This law marks the consummation of English anti-Catholic legislation.\n\nIn 1770 General Burgoyne had proposed to free Catholic soldiers from the obligations of the Test, but in vain. In 1774, however, it was necessary to pacify Canada, and the Quebec Act was passed, the first measure of toleration for Catholics sanctioned by Parliament since the days of the Tudor Queen Mary. Soon after began the war of American Independence, the difficulties of which gradually awakened English statesmen to the need of reconciling Catholics. The Irish Government took the first step by undoing William III's work of joining the profession of fidelity to the sovereign with the rejection of papal authority. In 1774 an oath was proposed of allegiance to King George (§ 1) and rejection of the Pretender (§ 2), but without prejudice to the pope's spiritual authority, or to any dogma of the Faith. The alleged malpractice of \"no faith with heretics\" was renounced (§ 3), so was the deposing power (§ 4), but without the objectionable words, impious, damnable and heretical.\" The \"temporal and civil jurisdiction of the pope, direct and indirect within the realm\" was also abjured (§ 5), and the promise was given that no dispensation from this oath should be considered valid (§ 6). This Irish Oath, of 1774, was accepted by the legislative authorities as proof of loyalty, and it was freely taken, though several clauses were infelicitously worded, though no advantage accrued from so doing. In 1778 however, the first Relief Bill, also called Sir George Savile's Act (after Sir George Savile), to relieve the English Catholics from the worst consequences of the penal laws, came before the English Parliament, and in it was embodied the Irish Oath (18 George III, c. 60). This Act was passed with little difficulty, and the oath was taken without remonstrance by the clergy of all schools.\n\nThe relief given by the Bill of 1778 was so imperfect that further legislation was soon called for, and now the disadvantages of the system of tests were acutely felt. A committee of lay Catholics, with Gallican proclivities, who afterwards characteristically called themselves the Cisalpine Club were negotiating with the Government (see ). To them it was represented that if more concessions were required more assurances should be given. They were accordingly presented with a long \"Protest\", which not only rejected the alleged malpractices, already disowned by the Irish Oath, but declaimed against them and others of the same kind in strong but untheological language. It reintroduced, for instance, the objectionable terms \"impious, heretical and damnable\" of James's Oath of Allegiance. That complications might have ensued from signing such a document was not difficult to foresee. Nevertheless, the committee insisted (1) that words would be understood in a broad popular way, and (2) that, to obtain the Relief Act, it must be signed instantly. To prevent such a misfortune, it was freely signed by laity and clergy, and by the four vicars Apostolic, but two of these recalled their names. When, however, the signatures had been obtained, the new Relief Bill was brought forward by Government, with an oath annexed founded on the Protest (hence called the \"Protestation Oath\"), which excluded from relief those who would not swear to it, and accept the name of \"Protesting Catholic Dissenters\". John Milner, later a bishop, argued against it.\n\nThe Second Relief Act, therefore, passed (1791) without changing the previous oath, or the name of Catholics. Though the Emancipation Bill was eventually carried without any tests, this was not foreseen at first. The Catholic Committee continued its endeavours for disarming Protestant prejudices, but their proposals (like the Veto) often savoured of Gallicanism. So too did the oath annexed to the bill proposed in 1813, which from its length was styled the \"Theological Oath\". Eventually, owing to the growing influence exercised by Daniel O'Connell and the Irish, Catholic Emancipation was granted without any tests at all in 1829.\n\nThe Relief Bills, hitherto mentioned, were generally measures of relief only, leaving the old statutes, oaths, and tests still on the Statute Book, and some of the chief officers of State had still to take them. The actual repeal of the disused tests and oaths of William III took place later.\n\nIn 1867, during the reign of Queen Victoria, the Declaration was repealed (30, 31 Vict., c. 75). After this, the only person bound to pronounce the oath was the king himself at the commencement of his reign. In 1871 the Promissory Oaths Bill removed all the old Oaths of Allegiance (34, 35 Vict., c. 48). In 1891 the first attempt was made by Lord Herries in the House of Lords to get rid of the king's Declaration, but the amendments offered by Government were so insignificant that the Catholics themselves voted against their being proposed at all.\n\nIn 1901 strong resolutions were passed against its retention by the House of Commons of Canada, as also by its hierarchy, and these were emphasized by similar petitions from the hierarchies of Australia, and the Catholics of the English colonies. In 1904, 1905, and 1908 bills or motions to the same effect were introduced by Lord Braye, Lord Grey, Lord Llandaff, the Duke of Norfolk, and Mr. Redmond, but without the desired effect. After the death of King Edward VII, however, King George V is believed to have urged the Government to bring in a repealing Act. This was done and public opinion, after some wavering, finally declared itself strongly on the side of the Bill, which was carried through both Houses by large majorities, and received Royal Assent on 3 August 1910, thus removing the last anti-Catholic oath or declaration from the English Constitution.\n\n\n\nFor the debates in the parliament, see:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11053864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11053864", "title": "Enhanced interrogation techniques", "text": "Enhanced interrogation techniques\n\n\"Enhanced interrogation techniques\" or \"enhanced interrogation\" is a euphemism for the U.S. government's program of systematic torture of detainees by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and various components of the U.S. Armed Forces at black sites around the world, including Bagram, Guantanamo Bay, and Abu Ghraib, authorized by officials of the George W. Bush administration. Methods used included beating, binding in contorted stress positions, hooding, subjection to deafening noise, sleep disruption, sleep deprivation to the point of hallucination, deprivation of food, drink, and withholding medical care for wounds, as well as waterboarding, walling, sexual humiliation, subjection to extreme heat or extreme cold, and confinement in small coffin-like boxes. Several detainees endured medically unnecessary \"rectal rehydration\", \"rectal fluid resuscitation\", and \"rectal feeding\". In addition to brutalizing detainees, there were threats to their families such as threats to harm children, and threats to sexually abuse or to cut the throat of detainees' mothers. \nThe number of detainees subjected to these methods has never been authoritatively established, nor how many died as a result of the interrogation regime, though this number is believed to be at least 100. The CIA admits to waterboarding three people implicated in the September 11 attacks: Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mohammed al-Qahtani. A Senate Intelligence Committee found photos of a waterboard surrounded by buckets of water at the Salt Pit prison, where the CIA had claimed waterboarding was never used. Former guards and inmates at Guantánamo have said that deaths which the US military called suicides at the time, were in fact homicides under torture. No murder charges have been brought for these or for acknowledged torture related homicides at Abu Ghraib and at Bagram.\n\nDebates arose over whether \"enhanced interrogation\" violated U.S. anti-torture statutes or international laws such as the UN Convention against Torture. In 2005, the CIA destroyed videotapes depicting prisoners being interrogated under torture; an internal justification was that what they showed was so horrific they would be \"devastating to the CIA\", and that \"the heat from destroying is nothing compared to what it would be if the tapes ever got into public domain.\" The United Nations special rapporteur on torture, Juan Mendez, stated that waterboarding is torture—\"immoral and illegal\", and in 2008, fifty-six House Democrats asked for an independent investigation.\n\nAmerican and European officials including former CIA Director Leon Panetta, former CIA officers, a Guantanamo prosecutor, and a military tribunal judge, have called \"enhanced interrogation\" a euphemism for torture. In 2009, both President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder said that certain techniques amount to torture, and repudiated their use. They declined to prosecute CIA, DoD, or Bush administration officials who authorized the program, while leaving open the possibility of convening an investigatory \"Truth Commission\" for what President Obama called a \"further accounting\".\n\nIn July 2014, the European Court of Human Rights formally ruled that \"enhanced interrogation\" is torture, and ordered Poland to pay restitution to men tortured at a CIA black site there. In December 2014, the U.S. Senate made public around 10% of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture, a report about the CIA's use of torture during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nAlmost immediately after the 9/11 attacks, Bush administration officials conferring by video link from bunkers decided to treat the attacks as acts of war, rather than merely crimes. The question arose: were captured prisoners to be treated as prisoners of war? Officials including Justice Department lawyer John Yoo recommended classifying them as \"detainees\" outside the protection of the Geneva Conventions or any other domestic or military law, and incarcerating them in special prisons instead of the barracks-like \"prisoner-of-war camp you saw in Hogan's Heroes or Stalag 17.\" On September 17, 2001, President Bush signed a still-classified directive giving the CIA the power to secretly imprison and interrogate detainees.\n\nIn late 2001, the first detainees including men like Murat Kurnaz and Lakhdar Boumediene, later established to be innocent and arrested on flawed intelligence or sold to the CIA for bounties, were brought to hastily improvised CIA/military bases such as Kandahar, Afghanistan. They were subjected to beatings, electric shocks, exposure to extreme cold, suspension from the ceiling by their arms, and drowning in buckets of water. An unknown number died as a result. In late 2001 and early 2002, interrogation under torture at secret sites was still ad hoc, not yet organized as a bureaucratic program, nor sanctioned under Justice Department legal cover.\n\nAs early as November 2001, the CIA general counsel began considering the legality of torture, writing that \"the Israeli example\" (using physical force against hundreds of detainees) could serve as \"a possible basis for arguing . . . torture was necessary to prevent imminent, significant, physical harm to persons, where there is no other available means to prevent the harm.\"\n\nIn April 2002 the CIA had captured its first important prisoner, Abu Zubaydah, who was transferred to a CIA black site and at the suggestion of psychologist James Mitchell the CIA embarked on interrogation methods which included sleep deprivation using bright lights and loud music—still prior to any legal authorization from the US Justice Department. Later that April Dr. Mitchell proposed a list of additional tactics, including locking people in cramped boxes, shackling them in painful positions, keeping them awake for a week at a time, covering them with insects, and waterboarding, a practice which the United States had previously characterized in war crimes prosecutions as torture.\n\nJose Rodriguez, head of the CIA's clandestine service, asked his superiors for authorization for what Rodriguez called an \"alternative set of interrogation procedures.\" The CIA sought immunity from prosecution, sometimes known as a \"get out of jail free card.\"\n\nIn May 2002, senior Bush administration officials including CIA Director George Tenet, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and Attorney General John Ashcroft met to discuss which techniques the CIA could legally use against Abu Zubaydah. Condoleezza Rice recalled \"being told that U.S. military personnel were subjected in training to certain physical and psychological interrogation techniques ...\" During the discussions, John Ashcroft is reported to have said, \"Why are we talking about this in the White House? History will not judge this kindly.\"\n\nAfter the Justice Department completed what are now known as the Torture Memos, Condoleezza Rice told the CIA that the techniques were approved in July 2002. Dick Cheney said \"I signed off on it; so did others.\" In 2010 Cheney said, \"I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program.\" In 2009 Rice said \"[w]e never tortured anyone;\" she maintained the abuse was \"not torture,\" but was \"legal\", and \"right\".\n\nIn addition, in 2002 and 2003, the CIA says they briefed several Democratic congressional leaders on the proposed \"enhanced interrogation technique\" program. These congressional leaders included Nancy Pelosi, the future Speaker of the House, and House Intelligence Committee Ranking Democrat Jane Harman. The response to the briefings was \"quiet acquiescence, if not downright support\", according to officials present. Ms. Harman was the only congressional leader to object to the tactics being proposed. Former senator Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the Senate intelligence committee after the 9/11 attacks, said he was not briefed on waterboarding and that in three instances agency officials said he'd attended briefings on days that his personal journal shows he was elsewhere.\n\nAt least one Bush administration official opposed torturing prisoners, Condoleezza Rice's most senior adviser Philip Zelikow. Upon learning details of the program, Zelikow wrote a memo to Rice contesting the Justice Department's Torture Memos, believing them wrong both legally and as a matter of policy. Zelikow's memo warned that the interrogation techniques breached US law, and could lead to prosecutions for war crimes. The Bush Administration attempted to collect all the copies of Zelikow's memo and destroy them. Jane Mayer, author of \"The Dark Side\", quotes Zelikow as predicting that \"America's descent into torture will in time be viewed like the Japanese internments\", in that \"(f)ear and anxiety were exploited by zealots and fools.\"\n\nThe authorized \"enhanced interrogation\" (the originator of this term is unknown, but it appears to be a calque of the German \"\", meaning \"intensified interrogation\", used in 1937 by Gestapo chief Heinrich Müller) was based on work done by James Elmer Mitchell and Bruce Jessen in the Air Force's Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE) program. The CIA contracted with the two psychologists to develop alternative, harsh interrogation techniques. However, neither of the two psychologists had any experience in conducting interrogations. Air Force Reserve Colonel Steve Kleinman stated that the CIA \"chose two clinical psychologists who had no intelligence background whatsoever, who had never conducted an interrogation... to do something that had never been proven in the real world.\" Associates of Mitchell and Jessen were skeptical of their methods and believed they did not possess any data about the impact of SERE training on the human psyche. The CIA came to learn that Mitchell and Jessen's expertise in waterboarding was probably \"misrepresented\" and thus, there was no reason to believe it was medically safe or effective. Despite these shortcomings of experience and know-how, the two psychologists boasted of being paid $1000 a day () plus expenses, tax-free by the CIA for their work.\n\nThe SERE program, which Mitchell and Jessen would reverse engineer, was used to train pilots and other soldiers on how to resist \"brainwashing\" techniques assumed to have been employed by the Chinese to extract false confessions from captured Americans during the Korean War. The program subjected trainees to \"waterboarding . . . sleep deprivation, isolation, exposure to extreme temperatures, enclosure in tiny spaces, bombardment with agonizing sounds at extremely damaging decibel levels, and religious and sexual humiliation.\" Under CIA supervision, Miller and Jessen adapted SERE into an offensive program designed to train CIA agents on how to use the harsh interrogation techniques to gather information from terrorist detainees. In fact, all of the tactics listed above would later be reported in the International Committee of the Red Cross Report on Fourteen High Value Detainees in CIA Custody as having been used on Abu Zubaydah.\n\nStephen Soldz, Steven Reisner and Brad Olson wrote an article describing how the techniques used mimic what was taught in the SERE-program: \"the military's Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape program that trains US Special Operations Forces, aviators and others at high risk of capture on the battlefield to evade capture and to resist 'breaking' under torture, particularly through giving false confessions or collaborating with their captors\".\n\nThe psychologists relied heavily on experiments done by American psychologist Martin Seligman in the 1970s on learned helplessness. In these experiments caged dogs were exposed to severe electric shocks in a random way in order to completely break their will to resist. Mitchell and Jessen applied this idea to the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah. Many of the interrogation techniques used in the SERE program, including waterboarding, cold cell, long-time standing, and sleep deprivation were previously considered illegal under U.S. and international law and treaties at the time of Abu Zubaydah's capture. In fact, the United States had prosecuted Japanese military officials after World War II and American soldiers after the Vietnam War for waterboarding and as recently as 1983. Since 1930, the United States had defined sleep deprivation as an illegal form of torture. Many other techniques developed by the CIA constitute inhuman and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nAccording to Human Rights First:\n\nInternal FBI memos and press reports have pointed to SERE training as the basis for some of the harshest techniques authorised for use on detainees by the Pentagon in 2002 and 2003.\n\nAnd \"Salon\" stated:\n\nA March 22, 2005, sworn statement by the former chief of the Interrogation Control Element at Guantánamo said instructors from SERE also taught their methods to interrogators of the prisoners in Cuba.\n\nWhile Jane Mayer reported for \"The New Yorker\":\n\nAccording to the SERE affiliate and two other sources familiar with the program, after September 11 several psychologists versed in SERE techniques began advising interrogators at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere. Some of these psychologists essentially \"tried to reverse-engineer\" the SERE program, as the affiliate put it. \"They took good knowledge and used it in a bad way\", another of the sources said. Interrogators and BSCT members at Guantánamo adopted coercive techniques similar to those employed in the SERE program.\n\nand continues to report:\n\nmany of the interrogation methods used in SERE training seem to have been applied at Guantánamo.\"\n\nA bipartisan report released in 2008 stated that:\n\na February 2002 memorandum signed by President George W. Bush, stating that the Third Geneva Convention guaranteeing humane treatment to prisoners of war did not apply to al-Qaeda or Taliban detainees, and a December 2002 memo signed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, approving the use of \"aggressive techniques\" against detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, as key factors that lead to the extensive abuses.\n\nHowever, the Bush administration's February 2002 memorandum had, in fact, stated that only al-Qaeda detainees were not covered by the Geneva Conventions. That same order held that Taliban detainees would be entitled to treatment under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nDonald Rumsfeld rescinded his December 2002 memo after six weeks.\n\nCommon Article 3 remains the policy under the Obama administration, and not the balance of the Third Geneva Convention.\n\nA Congressional bipartisan report in December 2008 established that:\n\nharsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA and the U.S. military were directly adapted from the training techniques used to prepare special forces personnel to resist interrogation by enemies that torture and abuse prisoners. The techniques included forced nudity, painful stress positions, sleep deprivation, and until 2003, waterboarding, a form of simulated drowning.\n\nIn December 2007, CIA director Michael Hayden stated that \"of about 100 prisoners held to date in the CIA program, the enhanced techniques were used on about 30, and waterboarding used on just three.\".\n\nThe report, \"Experiments in Torture: Human Subject Research and Evidence of Experimentation in the 'Enhanced' Interrogation Program\", published by the advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights, described personnel in the CIA's Office of Medical Services (OMS) performing research on the prisoners as the above techniques were used both serially and in combination. This report was based on previously classified documents made available by the Obama administration in 2010.\n\nAccording to ABC news in 2007, the CIA removed waterboarding from its list of acceptable interrogation techniques in 2006. ABC stated further that the last use of waterboarding was in 2003.\n\nIn 2003, the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's \"Working Group\" on interrogations requested that the DIA come up with prisoner interrogation techniques for the group's consideration. According to the 2008 U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee report on the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody, the DIA began drawing up the list of techniques with the help of its civilian employee, a former Guantanamo Interrogation Control Element (ICE) Chief David Becker. Becker claimed that the Working Group members were particularly interested in aggressive methods and that he \"was encouraged to talk about techniques that inflict pain.\"\n\nIt is unknown to what extent the agency's recommendations were used or for how long, but according to the same Senate report, the list drawn up by DIA included the use \"drugs such as sodium pentothal and demerol\", humiliating treatment using female interrogators and sleep deprivation. Becker claimed that he recommended the use of drugs due to rumors that another intelligence agency, name of which was redacted in the Senate report, had successfully used them in the past. According to the analysis of the Office of Defense Inspector General, the DIA's cited justification for the use of drugs was to \"[relax] detainee to cooperative state\" and that mind-altering substances were not used.\n\nSome more lurid revelations of DIA's alleged harsh interrogations came from FBI officers, who conducted their own screenings of detainees in Guantanamo along with other agencies. According to one account, the interrogators of what was then DIA's Defense HUMINT Service (currently the Defense Clandestine Service), forced subjects to watch gay porn, draped them with the Israeli Flag and interrogated them in rooms lit by strobe lights for 16–18 hours, all the while telling prisoners that they were from the FBI.\n\nThe real FBI operative was concerned that DIA's harsh methods and impersonation of FBI agents would complicate the Bureau's ability to do its job properly, saying \"The next time a real Agent tries to talk to that guy, you can imagine the result.\" A subsequent military inquiry countered FBI's allegations by saying that the prisoner treatment was degrading but not inhuman, without addressing the allegation of DIA staff regularly impersonating FBI officers - usually a felony offense. A year before this investigation was concluded, it was revealed that interrogations by special units of the U.S. military services were much harsher and more physical than any of the above DIA practices, to the point that 2 DIA officials reportedly complained, after which they were threatened by non-DIA interrogators.\n\nSimilar activities are thought to have transpired at the hands of DIA operatives in Bagram, where as recently as 2010 the organization ran the so-called \"Black jail\". According to a report published by The Atlantic, the jail was manned by DIA's DCHC staff, who were accused of beating and sexually humiliating high-value targets held at the site. The detention center outlived the black sites ran by the Central Intelligence Agency, with the DIA allegedly continuing to use \"restricted\" interrogation methods in the facility under a secret authorization. It is unclear what happened to the secret facility after the 2013 transfer of the base to Afghan authorities following several postponements.\n\nThe following techniques were authorized by the U.S. military:\n\nIn November 2006, former U.S. Army Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, in charge of Abu Ghraib prison until early 2004, told Spain's \"El País\" newspaper she had seen a letter signed by United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that allowed contractors employed by the U.S. to use techniques such as sleep deprivation during interrogation.'\" The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques.\" She said that this was contrary to the Geneva Conventions and quoted the Geneva Convention as saying, \"Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\" According to Karpinski, the handwritten signature was above his printed name and in the same handwriting in the margin was written, \"Make sure this is accomplished.\"\n\nOn May 1, 2005, \"The New York Times\" reported on an ongoing high-level military investigation into accusations of detainee abuse at Guantánamo, conducted by Lieutenant General Randall M. Schmidt of the Air Force, and dealing with: \"accounts by agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who complained after witnessing detainees subjected to several forms of harsh treatment. The FBI agents wrote in memorandums that were never meant to be disclosed publicly that they had seen female interrogators forcibly squeeze male prisoners' genitals, and that they had witnessed other detainees stripped and shackled low to the floor for many hours.\"\n\nOn July 12, 2005, members of a military panel told the committee that they proposed disciplining prison commander Major General Geoffrey Miller over the interrogation of Mohammed al Qahtani, who was forced to wear a bra, dance with another man, and threatened with dogs. The recommendation was overruled by General Bantz J. Craddock, commander of U.S. Southern Command, who referred the matter to the army's inspector general.\n\nIn an interview with AP on February 14, 2008, Paul Rester, chief military interrogator at Guantanamo Bay and director of the Joint Intelligence Group, said most of the information gathered from detainees came from non-coercive questioning and \"rapport building\", not harsh interrogation methods.\n\nIn 2006, senior law enforcement agents with the Criminal Investigation Task Force told MSNBC.com that they began to complain in 2002 inside the U.S. Department of Defense that the interrogation tactics used in Guantanamo Bay by a separate team of military intelligence investigators were unproductive, not likely to produce reliable information, and probably illegal. Unable to get satisfaction from the army commanders running the detainee camp, they took their concerns to David Brant, director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), who alerted Navy General Counsel Alberto J. Mora.\n\nGeneral Counsel Mora and Navy Judge Advocate General Michael Lohr believed the detainee treatment to be unlawful, and campaigned among other top lawyers and officials in the Defense Department to investigate, and to provide clear standards prohibiting coercive interrogation tactics. In response, on January 15, 2003, Rumsfeld suspended the approved interrogation tactics at Guantánamo Bay until a new set of guidelines could be produced by a working group headed by General Counsel of the Air Force Mary Walker.\n\nThe working group based its new guidelines on a legal memo from the United States Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel written by John Yoo and signed by Jay S. Bybee in August 2002, which would later become widely known as the \"Torture Memo.\" General Counsel Mora led a faction of the Working Group in arguing against these standards, and argued the issues with Yoo in person. The working group's final report was signed and delivered to Guantánamo without the knowledge of Mora and the others who had opposed its content. Mora has maintained that detainee treatment has been consistent with the law since the January 15, 2003, suspension of previously approved interrogation tactics.\n\nIt was not known publicly until 2008 that Yoo wrote another legal opinion, dated March 14, 2003, which he issued to the General Counsel of DOD, five days before the invasion of Iraq started. In it, he concluded that federal laws related to torture and other abuse did not apply to interrogators overseas – which at that time the administration applied to Guantanamo as well as locations such as Iraq.\n\nPresident Bush stated \"The United States of America does not torture. And that's important for people around the world to understand.\" The administration adopted the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 to address the multitude of incidents of detainee abuse. However, in his signing statement, Bush made clear that he reserved the right to waive this bill if he thought that was needed.\n\nPorter Goss, the Director of Central Intelligence, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 17, 2005, described waterboarding as falling into the area of \"professional interrogation techniques,\" differentiating them from torture:\n\n\"The Washington Post\" reported in January 2009 that Susan J. Crawford, convening authority of military commissions, stated about the interrogation of Mohammed al-Qahtani, one of the alleged \"20th hijackers\" of the September 11 attacks:\n\nThe techniques they used were all authorized, but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent... You think of torture, you think of some horrendous physical act done to an individual. This was not any one particular act; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him, that hurt his health. It was abusive and uncalled for. And coercive. Clearly coercive. It was that medical impact that pushed me over the edge [i.e., to call it torture].\n\nCrawford decided not to prosecute al-Qahtani because his treatment fell within the definition of torture, so evidence was tainted by it having been gained through coercion.\nFormer President Bush in his published memoirs defends the utility of \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques and continues to assert that they are not torture.\n\nFormer President Obama, former Attorney General Holder, and Guantanamo military prosecutor Crawford have called the techniques torture. The British government has determined the techniques would be classified as torture, and dismissed President Bush's claim to the contrary. A report by Human Rights First (HRF) and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) stated that these techniques constitute torture. They also cite the U.S. Office of the Inspector General report which concluded \"SERE-type interrogation techniques constitute 'physical or mental torture and coercion under the Geneva conventions.' \"A United Nations report denounced the US abuse of prisoners as tantamount to torture. The UN report called for cessation of the US-termed \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques, as the UN sees these methods as a form of torture. The UN report also admonishes against secret prisons, the use of which, is considered to amount to torture as well and should be discontinued.\n\nIn 2009, Paul Kane of \"The Washington Post\" said that the press was hesitant to define these techniques as torture, as it is a crime and nobody who engaged in \"enhanced interrogation\" has been charged or convicted. \"The New York Times\" terms the techniques \"harsh\" and \"brutal\" while avoiding the word \"torture\" in most but not all news articles, though it routinely identifies \"enhanced interrogation\" as torture in editorials. \"Slate\" magazine terms enhanced interrogation the \"U.S. torture program.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2009, NPR decided to ban using the word torture in what was a controversial act. Its Ombudsman Alicia Shepard's defense of the policy was that \"calling waterboarding torture is tantamount to taking sides.\" However, Berkeley Professor of Linguistics, Geoffrey Nunberg, pointed out that virtually all media around the world, other than what he called the \"spineless U.S. media\", call these techniques torture. In an article on the euphemisms invented by the media that also criticized NPR, Glenn Greenwald discussed the enabling \"corruption of American journalism\":\n\nThis active media complicity in concealing that our Government created a systematic torture regime, by refusing ever to say so, is one of the principal reasons it was allowed to happen for so long. The steadfast, ongoing refusal of our leading media institutions to refer to what the Bush administration did as \"torture\" – even in the face of more than 100 detainee deaths; the use of that term by a leading Bush official to describe what was done at Guantanamo; and the fact that media outlets frequently use the word \"torture\" to describe exactly the same methods when used by other countries --reveals much about how the modern journalist thinks.\n\nOn December 9, 2014, United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) released a 525-page document containing the key findings and an executive summary, of their report into the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program. The remainder of the 6,000 page report remains classified. The report concluded that the interrogation techniques were far more vicious and widespread than the CIA had previously reported; that \"brutality, dishonesty and seemingly arbitrary violence at times brought even [CIA] employees to moments of anguish.\" The report said that CIA officials had deceived their superiors at the White House, members of Congress and even sometimes their peers about how the interrogation program was being run and what it had achieved.\n\nThe executive summary lists 20 key findings:\n\n\nThe Senate Report examined in detail specifically whether torture provided information helpful in locating Osama Bin Laden, and concluded that it did not, and that the CIA deliberately misled political leaders and the public in saying it had.\n\nThe three former CIA directors George Tenet, Porter Goss, and Michael Hayden, who had supervised the program during their tenure, objected to the Senate Report in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece, calling it poorly done and partisan. They insisted that some information derived from the CIA program was useful, specifically that interrogation techniques made some detainees compliant and that the \"information provided by the totality of detainees in CIA custody\" had led to Osama Bin Laden. According to the CIA, enhanced interrogation \"conditions\" were used for security and \"other valid reasons, such as to create an environment conducive to transitioning captured and resistant terrorist (sic) to detainees participating in debriefings.\" \n\nRepublican Senator John McCain, citing Obama Administration CIA Director Leon Panetta (who did not join with the others in the Wall Street Journal Op-ed) had previously said that brutality produced no useful information in the hunt for Osama Bin Laden; leads were \"obtained through standard, noncoercive means.\" In May 2011, Panetta had written to Senator McCain, that:\n\nIn 2014, Panetta wrote that torture did produce some useful information, but that the product was not worth the price, and if asked whether America should engage in similar practices he would say \"no.\" Obama Administration CIA director John Brennan said that it is \"unknowable\" whether brutality helped or hindered in the collection of useful intelligence. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said whether information derived from CIA torture may have helped find Osama Bin Laden, President Obama believes \"the use of these techniques was not worth it because of the harm that was done to our national values and the sense of what we believe in as Americans.\" Similarly, Republican McCain agreed with Democrat Dianne Feinstein in remarks on the Senate floor that torture \"stained our national honor\" and did \"much harm and little practical good.\"\n\nOn request by the National Security Advisor Susan Rice in 2015, the CIA compiled a summary of key intelligence, which according to their records had been collected after the application of (unspecified) interrogation techniques. The memorandum lists intelligence related to the following topics: The Karachi Plot, The Heathrow Plot, The \"Second Wave\", The Guraba Cell, Issa al-Hindi, Abu Talha al-Pakistani, Hambali's Capture, Jafaar al-Tayyar, Dirty Bomb Plot, Shoe bomber, and Sh(a)kai (Pakistan). The CIA concluded that the enhanced interrogation techniques had been effective in providing intelligence and has been a key reason why al-Qa'ida has failed to launch a spectacular attack in the West since 11 September. 2001.\n\nIn December 2007 it became known that the CIA had destroyed many videotapes recording the interrogation of prisoners. Disclosures in 2010 revealed that Jose Rodriguez Jr., head of the directorate of operations at the CIA from 2004 to 2007, ordered the tapes destroyed because he thought they would be \"devastating to the CIA\", and that \"the heat from destroying is nothing compared to what it would be if the tapes ever got into public domain.\" \"The New York Times\" reported that according to \"some insiders,\" an inquiry into the C.I.A.'s secret detention program which analyzed these techniques, \"might end with criminal charges for abusive interrogations.\" In an Op-ed for the \"New York Times,\" Thomas H. Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, chair and vice chair of the 9/11 Commission, stated:\n\nAs a legal matter, it is not up to us to examine the C.I.A.'s failure to disclose the existence of these tapes. That is for others. What we do know is that government officials decided not to inform a lawfully constituted body, created by Congress and the president, to investigate one \"(of)\" the greatest tragedies to confront this country. We call that obstruction.\n\nResponding to the so-called \"torture memoranda\" Scott Horton noted:\n\nthe possibility that the authors of these memoranda counseled the use of lethal and unlawful techniques, and therefore face criminal culpability themselves. That, after all, is the teaching of United States v. Altstötter, the Nuremberg case brought against German Justice Department lawyers whose memoranda crafted the basis for implementation of the infamous \"Night and Fog Decree.\n\nJordan Paust concurred by responding to Mukasey's refusal to investigate and/or prosecute anyone that relied on these legal opinions\n\nit is legally and morally impossible for any member of the executive branch to be acting lawfully or within the scope of his or her authority while following OLC opinions that are manifestly inconsistent with or violative of the law. General Mukasey, just following orders is no defense!\n\nOn March 15, 2009, Mark Danner provided a report in the \"New York Review of Books\" (with an abridged version in \"The New York Times\") describing and commenting on the contents of a report by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), \"Report on the Treatment of Fourteen \"High Value Detainees\" in CIA Custody\" (43 pp., February 2007). \"Report... \" is a record of interviews with black site detainees, conducted between October 6 and 11 and December 4 and 14, 2006, after their transfer to Guantánamo. (According to Danner, the report was marked \"confidential\" and was not previously made public before being made available to him.)\n\nDanner provides excerpts of interviews with detainees, including Abu Zubaydah, Walid bin Attash, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. According to Danner, the report contains sections on \"methods of ill-treatment\" including suffocation by water, prolonged stress standing, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation and use of loud music, exposure to cold temperature/cold water, prolonged use of handcuffs and shackles, threats, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food. Danner quotes the ICRC report as saying that, \"in many cases, the ill-treatment to which they were subjected while held in the CIA program, either singly or in combination, constituted torture. In addition, many other elements of the ill-treatment, either singly or in combination, constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\"\n\nA heavily redacted version of the November 8, 2006 meeting was released by the CIA on June 10, 2016. The report tells that the ICRC finds the detainees stories \"largely credible, having put much stock in the fact that the story each detainee told about his transfer, treatment and conditions of confinement was basically consistent, even though they had been incommunicado with each other throughout their detention by us [the CIA].\" \n\nA bipartisan Senate Armed Services Committee report, released in part in December 2008 and in full in April 2009, concluded that the legal authorization of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" led directly to the abuse and killings of prisoners in US military facilities at Abu Ghraib, Bagram, and elsewhere. Brutal abuse believed to originate in Chinese communist torture techniques to extract false confessions from American POWs migrated from Guantanamo Bay to Afghanistan, then to Iraq and Abu Ghraib. The report concludes that some authorized techniques including \"use of stress positions and sleep deprivation combined with other mistreatment\" caused or were direct contributing factors in the cases of several prisoners who were \"tortured to death.\" The report also notes that authorizing abuse created the conditions for other, unauthorized abuse, by creating a legal and moral climate encouraging inhumane treatment. The legal memos condoning \"enhanced interrogation\" had \"redefined torture\", \"distorted the meaning and intent of anti-torture laws, [and] rationalized the abuse of detainees\", conveying the message that \"physical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment.\" What followed was an \"erosion of standards dictating that detainees be treated humanely.\" The report accused Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and his deputies of being, according to \"The Washington Post\", directly responsible as the \"authors and chief promoters of harsh interrogation policies that disgraced the nation and undermined U.S. security.\"\n\n\"Atlantic Monthly\" writer Andrew Sullivan has pointed out similarities between the Gestapo interrogation method called 'Verschärfte Vernehmung' and what the US called \"enhanced interrogation\". He asserts the first use of a term comparable to \"enhanced interrogation\" was a 1937 memo by Gestapo Chief Heinrich Müller coining the phrase \"Verschärfte Vernehmung\", German for \"sharpened questioning\", \"intensified\" or \"enhanced interrogation\" to describe subjection to extreme cold, sleep deprivation, suspension in stress positions, and deliberate exhaustion among other techniques. Sullivan reports that in 1948 Norway prosecuted German officials for what trial documents termed \"Verschärfte Vernehmung\" including subjection to cold water, and repeated beatings. Sullivan concludes:\n\nThe very phrase used by the president to describe torture-that-isn't-somehow-torture – \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" – is a term originally coined by the Nazis. The techniques are indistinguishable. The methods were clearly understood in 1948 as war-crimes. The punishment for them was death.\n\nOn June 8, 2008, fifty-six House Democrats asked for an independent investigation, raising the possibility that authorising these techniques may constitute a crime by Bush administration officials. The congressmen involved in calling for such an investigation included John Conyers, Jan Schakowsky, and Jerrold Nadler.\n\nThe letter was addressed to Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey observing that\n\ninformation indicates that the Bush administration may have systematically implemented, from the top down, detainee interrogation policies that constitute torture or otherwise violate the law.\n\nThe letter continues to state:\n\nBecause these apparent 'enhanced interrogation techniques' were used under cover of Justice Department legal opinions, the need for an outside special prosecutor is obvious.\n\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\" the request was denied because Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey felt that\n\nofficials acted in \"good faith\" when they sought legal opinions, and that the lawyers who provided them used their best judgment.\n\nThe article also reported that\n\nHe warned that criminalizing the process could cause policymakers to second-guess themselves and \"harm our national security well into the future.\"\n\nAfter Cheney acknowledged his involvement in authorising these tactics Senator Carl Levin, chair of the Armed Services Committee, a New York Times editorial, Glenn Greenwald and Scott Horton stressed the importance of a criminal investigation:\n\nA prosecutor should be appointed to consider criminal charges against top officials at the Pentagon and others involved in planning the abuse.\n\nShortly before the end of Bush's second term, news media in other countries were opining that under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the U.S. is obligated to hold those responsible to account under criminal law.\n\nThe United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Professor Manfred Nowak, on January 20, 2009, remarked on German television that, following the inauguration of Barack Obama as new President, George W. Bush has lost his head of state immunity and under international law, the U.S. is now mandated to start criminal proceedings against all those involved in these violations of the UN Convention Against Torture. Law professor Dietmar Herz explained Nowak's comments by saying that under U.S. and international law former President Bush is criminally responsible for adopting torture as an interrogation tool.\n\nOn February 4, 2009, the High Court of England and Wales ruled that evidence of possible torture in the case of Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian-born British resident who was held in Guantanamo Bay until 2009, could not be disclosed to the public:\n\nas a result of a statement by David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary, that if the evidence was disclosed the US would stop sharing intelligence with Britain. That would directly threaten the UK's national security, Miliband had told the court.\n\nThe judges said they found it \"difficult to conceive\" the rationale for the US's objections to releasing the information, which contained \"no disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters\". Adding, \"we did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials\".\n\nResponding to the ruling, David Davis, the Conservative MP and former Shadow Home Secretary, commented:\n\nThe ruling implies that torture has taken place in the <nowiki>[Binyam]</nowiki> Mohamed case, that British agencies may have been complicit, and further, that the United States government has threatened our high court that if it releases this information the US government will withdraw its intelligence cooperation with the United Kingdom.\n\nThe High Court judges also stated in 2009, that a criminal investigation, by the UK's Attorney General, into possible torture had begun.\n\nIn February 2010, the UK Court of Appeal ruled that material held by the UK Foreign Secretary must be made public. The judges also concluded that Binyam Mohamed had been subjected to \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by the United States authorities\" and that British Intelligence knew that Mohamed was being tortured by the CIA.\n\nAfter the disclosure of the use of the techniques, debates arose over the legality of the techniques—whether they had violated U.S. or international law.\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks in 2001, several memoranda analyzing the legality of various interrogation methods were written by John Yoo from the Office of Legal Counsel. The memos, known today as the torture memos, advocate enhanced interrogation techniques, while pointing out that avoiding the Geneva Conventions would reduce the possibility of prosecution under the US War Crimes Act of 1996 for actions taken in the War on Terror. In addition, a new US definition of torture was issued. Most actions that fall under the international definition do not fall within this new definition advocated by the U.S.\n\nThe Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate US prohibitions against torture unless they \"have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering\", according to a previously secret US Justice Department memo released on July 24, 2008. The interrogator's \"good faith\" and \"honest belief\" that the interrogation will not cause such suffering protects the interrogator, the memo adds. \"Because specific intent is an element of the offense, the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture\", Jay Bybee, then the Assistant Attorney General, wrote in the memo dated August 1, 2002, addressed to the CIA acting General Counsel John A. Rizzo. The 18-page memo is heavily redacted, with 10 of its 18 pages completely blacked out and only a few paragraphs legible on the others.\n\nAnother memo released on the same day advises that \"the waterboard\", does \"not violate the Torture Statute.\" It also cites a number of warnings against torture, including statements by President Bush and a then-new Supreme Court ruling \"which raises possible concerns about future US judicial review of the [interrogation] Program.\"\n\nA third memo instructs interrogators to keep records of sessions in which \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" are used. The memo is signed by then-CIA director George Tenet and dated January 28, 2003.\n\nThe memos were made public by the American Civil Liberties Union, which obtained the three CIA-related documents under Freedom of Information Act requests. They were among nearly 140,000 formerly classified documents from the Department of Defense, the Justice Department, and the CIA that provide details on the treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody in the \"War on Terror\" gathered by the ACLU.\n\nThe less redacted version of the August 1, 2002, memo signed by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee (regarding Abu Zubaydah) and four memos from 2005 signed by Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury addressed to CIA and analysing the legality of various specific interrogation methods, including waterboarding, were released by Barack Obama's administration on April 16, 2009\n\nFollowing the release of the CIA documents, Philip Zelikow, a former State Department lawyer and adviser to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said that in 2005, he had written a legal memo objecting to torture. In it he argued that it was unlikely that \"any federal court would agree (that the approval of harsh interrogation techniques) ... was a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution.\" He claimed that the Bush Administration had ordered all copies of his legal memo be collected and destroyed.\n\nIn May 2005, in response to requests from the CIA, Bradbury authored several memoranda that confirmed that several so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" did not constitute torture, including waterboarding, walling, stress positions, striking a prisoner, exposure to extreme temperatures, dousing with cold water, and forced sleep deprivation of up to 180 hours ( days), even when used in combination. These memoranda found the CIA's practices to be lawful if applied in accordance with specified conditions, limitations, and safeguards, including those set forth in the agency's interrogation procedures. Bradbury's memoranda were described by Democrats as an attempt to sidestep anti-torture laws and subvert a 2004 public Justice Department legal opinion characterizing torture as \"abhorrent\". These memoranda were publicly released by the Obama Administration on April 16, 2009.\n\nBradbury authored an additional memo dated July 2007, seeking to reconcile the interrogation techniques with new developments, including intervening legislation such as the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and the December 2005 Detainee Treatment Act. In response to this and other new legislation, the 2007 memo provided legal authorization and OLC approval for a more limited set of actions for use when interrogating high-value detainees. This approval encompassed six listed techniques, including temporary food deprivation (no less than 1,000 calories/day), sleep deprivation by being forced to hold a \"standing position for as many as four days\", and several types of physical striking.\n\nThe cumulative effect of Bush administration legal memos and exemption from prosecution had been to create a \"law free zone\" according to the former Chief Prosecutor at Guantánamo, where civilian politicians expected the military to use torture \"against our will and judgment.\"\n\nOn May 19, 2006, the UN Committee against Torture issued a report stating the U.S. should stop secretly detaining, torturing, and ill-treating terror suspects, since such treatment is illegal under international law.\n\nIn July 2014, the European Court of Human Rights condemned the government of Poland for participating in CIA extraordinary rendition to a black site in Poland for enhanced interrogation, which the court called \"torture, inhumane and degrading treatment.\" The court ordered the government of Poland to pay restitution to men who had been tortured there.\n\nA report by Human Rights First (HRF) and Physicians for Human Rights (PFH) stated that these techniques constitute torture. Their press release said:\n\nThe report concludes that each of the ten tactics is likely to violate U.S. laws, including the War Crimes Act, the U.S. Torture Act, and the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005.\n\nThe Constitution Project convened a review of interrogation and detention programs in the years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It concluded in 2013 that \"it is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture\" and that the nation's highest officials bore ultimate responsibility for it.\n\nOn December 14, 2005, the Detainee Treatment Act was passed into law, setting the Army policy as standard for all agencies and prohibiting \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.\"\n\nOn February 13, 2008, the U.S. Senate, in a 51 to 45 vote, approved a bill clarifying this language, allowing only \"those interrogation techniques explicitly authorized by the 2006 Army Field Manual.\" \"The Washington Post\" stated:\n\nThe measure would effectively ban the use of simulated drowning, temperature extremes and other harsh tactics that the CIA used on al-Qaeda prisoners after the September 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nPresident George W. Bush has said in a BBC interview he would veto such a bill after previously signing an executive order that allows \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" and may exempt the CIA from Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nOn March 8, 2008, President Bush vetoed this bill.\n\nBecause the danger remains, we need to ensure our intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the terrorists\", Bush said in his weekly radio address . \"The bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror – the CIA program to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives.\" Bush said that the methods used by the military are designed for interrogating \"lawful combatants captured on the battlefield\", not the \"hardened terrorists\" normally questioned by the CIA. \"If we were to shut down this program and restrict the CIA to methods in the Field Manual, we could lose vital information from senior al Qaida terrorists, and that could cost American lives\", Bush said.\n\nMassachusetts senator Edward Kennedy described Bush's veto as \"one of the most shameful acts of his presidency\". He said, \"Unless Congress overrides the veto, it will go down in history as a flagrant insult to the rule of law and a serious stain on the good name of America in the eyes of the world.\"\n\nAccording to Jane Mayer, during the transition period for then President-elect Barack Obama, his legal, intelligence, and national-security advisers had met at the CIA's headquarters in Langley to discuss \"whether a ban on brutal interrogation practices would hurt their ability to gather intelligence\", and among the consulted experts:\n\nThere was unanimity among Obama's expert advisers... that to change the practices would not in any material way affect the collection of intelligence.\n\nOn January 22, 2009, President Obama signed Executive Order 13491 requiring the CIA to use only the 19 interrogation methods outlined in the United States Army Field Manual on interrogations \"unless the Attorney General with appropriate consultation provides further guidance.\"\n\nU.S. and international law states that if a country is unwilling or unable to prosecute its own officials for torture, an international tribunal may do so.\n\nThe United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Torture, Human Rights Watch, and American legal scholars have called for the prosecution of Bush administration officials who ordered torture, conspired to provide legal cover for torture, and CIA and DoD personnel and contract workers who carried it out. Former Bush administration attorney John Yoo has said that CIA officers risk prosecution for acts outside what the Justice Department specifically authorized. A dozen lower-ranking Defense Department personnel were prosecuted for abuses at Abu Ghraib; one CIA contractor who beat a prisoner to death in Afghanistan was prosecuted for assault.\n\nHowever, neither US domestic nor international prosecution of high-ranking officials is likely.\n\nPresident Obama, while condemning torture, ruled out prosecuting his Bush administration predecessors. According to University of California Law School Dean Christopher Edley Jr., who served on President Obama's transition team, the decision not to prosecute predated Obama's taking office and was due to concern about a backlash by leaders of the military, the National Security Agency and the CIA. In an interview, Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor under Obama, commented on the difficult political problems that torture prosecutions would have created, both in distracting from the administration's response to the Great Recession and potentially alienating the president from his own agencies. Legal analysts such as Eric Posner and Andrew Napolitano have said that prosecutions would create a precedent putting Obama administration officials at risk of politically motivated prosecutions by their successors.\n\nThe US Department of Justice announced that there will be no trials even of those who went well beyond what the Torture Memos allowed, including those who tortured detainees to death. The rationale has not been disclosed. In response to a FOIA lawsuit, the Obama administration argued that the rationale should be kept secret because \"disclosing them could affect the candor of law enforcement deliberations about whether to bring criminal charges.\"\n\nThere is no statute of limitations for war crimes in international law. However, prosecutions in either the International Criminal Court, or in the courts of a particular nation invoking the doctrine of universal jurisdiction, are also regarded as unlikely.\n\nThe U.S. under the Bush administration \"unsigned\" the treaty that had conferred on the International Criminal Court jurisdiction over Americans. In addition, President Bush signed the 2002 American Service-Members' Protection Act allowing military invasion of The Hague to rescue any Americans the court might detain for war crimes trials. Some torture occurred in CIA black site prisons in countries that remain parties to the treaty, like Poland, Afghanistan, Lithuania, and Romania. But for political reasons those countries are not in a position to initiate a prosecution, nor to extradite US officials to face charges.\n\nInvoking the universal jurisdiction doctrine, the Center for Constitutional Rights tried first in Switzerland and then in Canada to prosecute former President George Bush, on behalf of four tortured detainees. Bush cancelled his trip to Switzerland after news of the planned prosecution came to light. Bush has traveled to Canada but the Canadian government shut down the prosecution in advance of his arrest. The Center has filed a grievance with the United Nations for Canada's failure to enforce the Convention Against Torture, on which action is pending.\n\nWithout any prosecutions the possibility remains that a future presidential administration could claim torture is legal and revive its practice. \nIn February 2016, several leading U.S. presidential candidates openly argued for reintroducing torture. Including President Donald Trump who expressed his desire to bring back waterboarding. \nThe U.S. reluctance to punish torturers has set back the fight against torture worldwide, according to Juan E. Méndez, the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture.\n\nFormer CIA officer John Kiriakou in 2007 was the first official within the U.S. government to confirm the use of waterboarding of al-Qaeda prisoners as an interrogation technique, which he described as torture.\n\nOn October 22, 2012, Kiriakou pleaded guilty to disclosing classified information about a fellow CIA officer that connected the covert operative to a specific operation. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison on January 25, 2013.\n\nOn July 24, 2014, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Poland violated the European Convention on Human Rights when it cooperated with the US, allowing the CIA to hold and torture Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri on its territory in 2002–2003. The court ordered the Polish government to pay each of the men 100,000 euros in damages. It also awarded Abu Zubaydah 30,000 euros to cover his costs.\n\nOn 31 May 2018, the ECHR ruled that Romania and Lithuania also violated the rights of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in 2003-2005 and in 2005-2006 respectively, and Lithuania and Romania were ordered to pay 100,000 euros in damages each to Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Nashiri.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12712", "title": "Gonzo journalism", "text": "Gonzo journalism\n\nGonzo journalism is a style of journalism that is written without claims of objectivity, often including the reporter as part of the story via a first-person narrative. The word \"gonzo\" is believed to have been first used in 1970 to describe an article by Hunter S. Thompson, who later popularized the style. It is an energetic first-person participatory writing style in which the author is a protagonist, and it draws its power from a combination of social critique and self-satire. It has since been applied to other subjective artistic endeavors.\n\nGonzo journalism involves an approach to accuracy that concerns the reporting of personal experiences and emotions, in contrast to traditional journalism, which favors a detached style and relies on facts or quotations that can be verified by third parties. Gonzo journalism disregards the strictly-edited product favored by newspaper media and strives for a more personal approach; the personality of a piece is as important as the event or actual subject of the piece. Use of sarcasm, humor, exaggeration, and profanity is common.\n\nThompson, who was among the forefathers of the new journalism movement, said in the February 15, 1973, issue of \"Rolling Stone\", \"If I'd written the truth I knew for the past ten years, about 600 people—including me—would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today. Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism.\"\n\nThe term \"gonzo\" was first used in connection with Hunter S. Thompson by \"The Boston Globe\" magazine editor Bill Cardoso in 1970. He described Thompson's article \"The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved,\" which was written for the June 1970 edition of \"Scanlan's Monthly\", as \"pure Gonzo journalism.\" Cardoso claimed that \"gonzo\" was South Boston Irish slang describing the last man standing after an all-night drinking marathon. He also claimed that it was a corruption of the French Canadian word \"gonzeaux,\" which means \"shining path,\" although this is disputed.\n\nAnother speculation is that the word may have been inspired by the 1960 hit song '\"\" by New Orleans rhythm and blues pianist James Booker. This possibility is supported by a 2007 oral biography of Thompson, which states that the term is taken from a song by Booker but does not explain why Thompson or Cardoso would have chosen the term to describe Thompson's journalism. The 2013 documentary \"\" quotes Thompson's literary executor as saying that the song was the origin of the term. According to a Greg Johnson biographical note on Booker, the song title \"Gonzo\" comes from a character in a movie called \"The Pusher\", which in turn may have been inspired by a 1956 Evan Hunter novel of the same title.\n\nThompson himself first used the term referring to his own work on page 12 of the counterculture classic \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\". He wrote, \"But what \"was\" the story? Nobody had bothered to say. So we would have to drum it up on our own. Free Enterprise. The American Dream. Horatio Alger gone mad on drugs in Las Vegas. Do it \"now\": pure Gonzo journalism.\"\n\nThompson based his style on William Faulkner's notion that \"fiction is often the best fact\". While the things that Thompson wrote about are basically true, he used satirical devices to drive his points home. He often wrote about recreational drugs and alcohol use, which added subjective flair to his reporting. The term \"gonzo\" has also come into (sometimes pejorative) use to describe journalism in Thompson's style, characterized by a drug-fueled stream of consciousness writing technique.\n\n\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" followed the Mint 400 piece in 1971 and included a main character by the name of Raoul Duke, accompanied by his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, with defining art by Ralph Steadman. Although this book is considered a prime example of gonzo journalism, Thompson regarded it as a failed experiment. He had intended it to be an unedited record of everything he did as it happened, but he edited the book five times before publication.\n\nThompson would instigate events himself, often in a prankish or belligerent manner, and then document both his actions and those of others. Notoriously neglectful of deadlines, Thompson often annoyed his editors because he submitted articles late, \"too late to be edited, yet still in time for the printer\". Thompson wanted his work to be read as he wrote it, in its \"true Gonzo\" form. Historian Douglas Brinkley said gonzo journalism requires virtually no rewriting and frequently uses transcribed interviews and verbatim telephone conversations.\n\n\"I don't get any satisfaction out of the old traditional journalist's view: 'I just covered the story. I just gave it a balanced view,'\" Thompson said in an interview for the online edition of \"The Atlantic\". \"Objective journalism is one of the main reasons American politics has been allowed to be so corrupt for so long. You can't be objective about Nixon.\"\n\nThompson felt that objectivity in journalism was a myth. Gonzo journalism has now become a \"bona fide\" style of writing that concerns itself with \"telling it like it is\", similar to the New Journalism of the 1960s, led primarily by Tom Wolfe and also championed by Lester Bangs, George Plimpton, Terry Southern, and John Birmingham, and is considered a subgenre of New Journalism. When asked whether there was a difference between the two, Thompson answered, \"Yeah, I think so. Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, for instance, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then I don't really think of myself as a reporter.\"\n\nIn 1998, Christopher Locke asserted that the webzine genre is descended from gonzo journalism, a claim that has since been extended to social media.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2941182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2941182", "title": "Japanese input methods", "text": "Japanese input methods\n\nJapanese input methods are the methods used to input Japanese characters on a computer.\n\nThere are two main methods of inputting Japanese on computers. One is via a romanized version of Japanese called \"rōmaji\" (literally \"Roman character\"), and the other is via keyboard keys corresponding to the Japanese \"kana\". Some systems may also work via a graphical user interface, or GUI, where the characters are chosen by clicking on buttons or image maps.\n\nJapanese keyboards (as shown on the second image) have both hiragana and Roman letters indicated. The JIS, or Japanese Industrial Standard, keyboard layout keeps the Roman letters in the English QWERTY layout, with numbers above them. Many of the non-alphanumeric symbols are the same as on English-language keyboards, but some symbols are located in other places. The hiragana symbols are also ordered in a consistent way across different keyboards. For example, the \"Q, W, E, R, T, Y\" keys correspond to た, て, い, す, か, ん (\"ta\", \"te\", \"i\", \"su\", \"ka\", and \"n\") respectively when the computer is used for direct hiragana input.\n\nSince Japanese input requires switching between Roman and hiragana entry modes, and also conversion between hiragana and kanji (as discussed below), there are usually several special keys on the keyboard. This varies from computer to computer, and some OS vendors have striven to provide a consistent user interface regardless of the type of keyboard being used. On non-Japanese keyboards, option- or control- key sequences can perform all of the tasks mentioned below.\n\nOn most Japanese keyboards, one key switches between Roman characters and Japanese characters. Sometimes, each mode (Roman and Japanese) may even have its own key, in order to prevent ambiguity when the user is typing quickly.\n\nThere may also be a key to instruct the computer to convert the latest hiragana characters into kanji, although usually the space key serves the same purpose since Japanese writing doesn't use spaces.\n\nSome keyboards have a \"mode\" key to switch between different forms of writing. This of course would only be the case on keyboards that contain more than one set of Japanese symbols. Hiragana, katakana, halfwidth katakana, halfwidth Roman letters, and fullwidth Roman letters are some of the options. A typical Japanese character is square while Roman characters are typically variable in width. Since all Japanese characters occupy the space of a square box, it is sometimes desirable to input Roman characters in the same square form in order to preserve the grid layout of the text. These Roman characters that have been fitted to a square character cell are called fullwidth, while the normal ones are called halfwidth. In some fonts these are fitted to half-squares, like some monospaced fonts, while in others they are not. Often, fonts are available in two variants, one with the halfwidth characters monospaced, and another one with proportional halfwidth characters. The name of the typeface with proportional halfwidth characters is often prefixed with \"P\" for \"proportional\".\n\nFinally, a keyboard may have a special key to tell the OS that the last kana entered should not be converted to kanji. Sometimes this is just the \"Return\"/\"Enter\" key.\n\nA thumb-shift keyboard is an alternative design, popular among professional Japanese typists. Like a standard Japanese keyboard, it has hiragana characters marked in addition to Latin letters, but the layout is completely different. Most letter keys have two kana characters associated with them, which allows all the characters to fit in three rows, like in Western layouts. In the place of the space bar key on a conventional keyboard, there are two additional modifier keys, operated with thumbs - one of them is used to enter the alternate character marked, and the other is used for voiced sounds. The semi-voiced sounds are entered using either the conventional shift key operated by the little finger, or take place of the voiced sound for characters not having a voiced variant.\n\nThe kana-to-kanji conversion is done in the same way as when using any other type of keyboard. There are dedicated conversion keys on some designs, while on others the thumb shift keys double as such.\n\nAs an alternative to direct input of kana, a number of Japanese input method editors allow Japanese text to be entered using romaji, which can then be converted to kana or kanji. This method does not require the use of a Japanese keyboard with kana markings.\n\nThe primary system used to input Japanese on mobile phones is based on the numerical keypad. Each number is associated with a particular sequence of kana, such as \"ka\", \"ki\", \"ku\", \"ke\", \"ko\" for '2', and the button is pressed repeatedly to get the correct kana – each key corresponds to a column in the gojūon (5 row × 10 column grid of kana), while the number of presses determines the row. Dakuten and handakuten marks, punctuation, and other symbols can be added by other buttons in the same way. Kana to kanji conversion is done via the arrow and other keys.\n\nFlick input is a Japanese input method used on smartphones. The key layout is the same as the Keitai input, but rather than pressing a key repeatedly, the user can swipe from the key in a certain direction to produce the desired character. Smartphone Japanese IMEs such as Google Japanese Input, and S-Shoin all support flick input.\n\nIn addition to the industry standard QWERTY and 12 key layouts, Google Japanese Input offers a 15-key Godan keyboard layout, which is an alphabet layout optimized for romaji input. The letters fit in a five rows by three columns grid. The left column consists of the five vowels, in the same order as the columns in the Gojūon table (\"a\", \"i\", \"u\", \"e\", \"o\"), while the central and right column consists of letters for the nine main voiceless consonants of kanas, in the same order as the rows in the Gojūon table (\"k\", \"s\", \"t\", \"n\", \"[special]\"; \"h\", \"m\", \"y\", \"r\", \"w\"). Other characters are typed by flick gesture:\n\nUnlike the 12-key input, repeating a key in Godan is not interpreted as a gesture to cycle through kana with different vowels, but rather it would be interpreted as a repeated romaji letter behaving the same as in the QWERTY layout mode.\n\nOther consumer devices in Japan which allow for text entry via on-screen programming, such as digital video recorders and video game consoles, allow the user to toggle between the numerical keypad and a full keyboard (QWERTY, or ABC order) input system.\n\nAfter the kana have been input, they are either left as they are, or converted into kanji (Chinese characters). The Japanese language has many homophones, and conversion of a kana spelling (representing the pronunciation) into a kanji (representing the standard written form of the word) is often a one-to-many process. The kana to kanji converter offers a list of candidate kanji writings for the input kana, and the user may use the space bar or arrow keys to scroll through the list of candidates until they reach the correct writing. On reaching the correct written form, pressing the \"Enter\" key, or sometimes the \"henkan\" key, ends the conversion process. This selection can also be controlled through the GUI with a mouse or other pointing device.\n\nIf the hiragana is required, pressing the \"Enter\" key immediately after the characters are entered will end the conversion process and results in the hiragana as typed. If katakana is required, it is usually presented as an option along with the kanji choices. Alternatively, on some keyboards, pressing the (literally \"no conversion\") button switches between katakana and hiragana.\nSophisticated kana to kanji converters (known collectively as input method editors, or IMEs), allow conversion of multiple kana words into kanji at once, freeing the user from having to do a conversion at each stage. The user can convert at any stage of input by pressing the space bar or henkan button, and the converter attempts to guess the correct division of words. Some IME programs display a brief definition of each word in order to help the user choose the correct kanji.\n\nSometimes the kana to kanji converter may guess the correct kanji for all the words, but if it does not, the cursor (arrow) keys may be used to move backwards and forwards between candidate words, or digit keys can be used to select one of them directly (without pressing cursor keys multiple times and pressing \"Enter\" to confirm the choice). If the selected word boundaries are incorrect, the word boundaries can be moved using the control key (or shift key, \"e.g.\" on iBus-Anthy) plus the arrow keys.\n\nModern systems learn the user's preferences for conversion and put the most recently selected candidates at the top of the conversion list, and also remember which words the user is likely to use when considering word boundaries.\n\nThe systems used on mobile phones go even further, and try to guess entire phrases or sentences. After a few kana have been entered, the phone automatically offers entire phrases or sentences as possible completion candidates, jumping beyond what has been input. This is usually based on words sent in previous messages.\n\n\n"}

It became extinct in the Late Middle Ages.\n\nThe name comes from the land of Knaan, a geo-ethnological term denoting the Jewish populations living east of the Elbe River (as opposed to the Ashkenazi Jews, living to its west, or the Sephardi Jews of the Iberian Peninsula). As such, the land is often translated as simply \"Slavonia\" or Slavic Europe.\n\nThe term is derived from ancient Canaan (Hebrew: כנען \"kəna'an\").\n\nThe language became extinct some time in the Middle Ages, possibly because of the expansion of the Ashkenazi culture and its own Yiddish language, based on German. That hypothesis is often backed, but the large number of Yiddish loanwords of Slavic origin, many of which were no longer in use in Slavic languages themselves at the time of the Ashkenazi expansion. They are believed to come from Knaanic rather than from Czech, Sorbian or Polish. The linguist Paul Wexler has hypothesised that Knaanic is actually the direct predecessor of Yiddish and that the language later became Germanised. In other words, the Knaanim, that is, the people speaking the Judaeo-Slavic languages, were the main cause of changes in Yiddish. That view has been dismissed by nearly all mainstream academics, however, and contrasts with the more widely-accepted theories of Max Weinreich, who argued that Slavic loanwords were assimilated only after Yiddish had already been fully formed.\n\nA possible early example of Knaanic is a 9th-century letter for a Jewish community of Ruthenia. One of the very few commonly-accepted examples of Knaanic is inscriptions on bracteate coins issued under Mieszko the Old and Leszek the White, two Polish rulers of 12th and 13th century. The last evidence of usage of the language (written with the Hebrew script) comes from the 16th century.\n\nThe reason that Knaanic inscriptions, which use Hebrew letters, appear on coins minted for a Polish duke is that at the time, he leased some mints to Jews. The mint masters were responsible for collecting bullion and striking coins as well as periodically taking in and restriking existing coins.\n\nThe inscriptions on the coins range widely. Some are Hebrew names, possibly those of the mintmasters. Some are the names of the towns in which the mint operated, for instance Kalisz, the burial place of Mieszko the Old. Some have the duke's name. One in the National Bank of Poland's numismatic collection bears the word \"bracha\", Hebrew for blessing.\n\n\n"}

It was developed in the 18th century by slaves who used a pidgin language to communicate with each other as well as with their French masters, who did not understand the various African languages. The pidgin evolved with later generations to become a casual language.

Regardless of their soundness, all registers and manners of speech can demonstrate fallacies.\n\nBecause of their variety of structure and application, fallacies are challenging to classify so as to satisfy all practitioners. Fallacies can be classified strictly by either their structure or content, such as classifying them as formal fallacies or informal fallacies, respectively. The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic, relevance through omission, relevance through intrusion, and relevance through presumption. On the other hand, fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur, such as material fallacies (content), verbal fallacies (linguistic), and again formal fallacies (error in inference). In turn, material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies, while formal fallacies may be clearly placed into the more precise category of logical (deductive) fallacies. Yet, verbal fallacies may be placed into either informal or deductive classifications; compare equivocation which is a word or phrase based ambiguity, e. g. \"he is mad\", which may refer to either him being angry or clinically insane, to the fallacy of composition which is premise and inference based ambiguity, e. g. \"this must be a good basketball team because each of its members is an outstanding player\".\n\nFaulty inferences in deductive reasoning are common formal or logical fallacies. As the nature of inductive reasoning is based on probability, a fallacious inductive argument or one that is potentially misleading, is often classified as \"weak\".\n\nThe conscious or habitual use of fallacies as rhetorical devices are prevalent in the desire to persuade when the focus is more on communication and eliciting common agreement rather than the correctness of the reasoning. The effective use of a fallacy by an orator may be considered clever, but by the same token, the reasoning of that orator should be recognized as unsound, and thus the orator's claim, supported by an unsound argument, will be regarded as unfounded and dismissed.\n\nA formal fallacy is an error in logic that can be seen in the argument's form. All formal fallacies are specific types of non sequiturs. \n\nA propositional fallacy is an error in logic that concerns compound propositions. For a compound proposition to be true, the truth values of its constituent parts must satisfy the relevant logical connectives that occur in it (most commonly: <and>, <or>, <not>, <only if>, <if and only if>). The following fallacies involve inferences whose correctness is not guaranteed by the behavior of those logical connectives, and hence, which are not logically guaranteed to yield true conclusions.\nTypes of propositional fallacies:\n\nA quantification fallacy is an error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion.\n\nSyllogistic fallacies – logical fallacies that occur in syllogisms.\n\nInformal fallacies – arguments that are fallacious for reasons other than structural (formal) flaws and usually require examination of the argument's content.\n\n\nFaulty generalization – reach a conclusion from weak premises. Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions yet only weakly buttress the conclusions. A faulty generalization is thus produced.\n\nQuestionable cause - Is a general type error with many variants. Its primary basis is the confusion of association with causation. Either by inappropriately deducing (or rejecting) causation or a broader failure to properly investigate the cause of an observed effect. \n\n\nA red herring fallacy, one of the main subtypes of fallacies of relevance, is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. In the general case any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion.\n\nRed herring – a speaker attempts to distract an audience by deviating from the topic at hand by introducing a separate argument the speaker believes is easier to speak to. Argument given in response to another argument, which is irrelevant and draws attention away from the subject of argument. \"See also irrelevant conclusion.\"\n\n\n\nThe following is a sample of books for further reading, selected for a combination of content, ease of access via the internet, and to provide an indication of published sources that interested readers may review.

It is specially designed for use where there are no harbours of refuge, chiefly upon the surf-beaten Coromandel Coast of India. It is used in shooting shore seines and also as a cargo lighter. Its range extends along the whole of the eastern coast of India northwards of Cape Calimere. The equivalent type of boats used on the west coast are the beach lighters. Masula boats are generally smaller, although they can be up to 9 m in length. The pattern varies across the coast, namely, padava on the Andhra coast and bar boat in Orissa coast. A variant found in the region between Kakinada and Machilipatnam has ribs inside.\n\nThe masula boats were mainly used by Europeans in the 19th century before the building of Chennai Port. The dimensions of the masula boat generally varies from 30 to 35 feet in length, 10 to 11 feet in breadth, and 7 to 8 feet in depth. On the Coromandel Coast, it is distinctly short, measuring as short as about 28 feet in length. In the northern region of the coast, chiefly in Godavari and Visakhapatnam districts of the Andhra coast, it exceeds 40 feet in length. However, the beam and the depth measures about 8 feet and 4 feet, respectively, across the region. An oculus is sometimes painted on the bows of the masula boats in the Madras region.

He grew up in a bilingual, Slovene-German environment and then attended the lyceum in Klagenfurt and in Graz. During his studies in Klagenfurt, he came under the influence of Anton Martin Slomšek, a Roman Catholic priest and author who propagated the use of Slovene in the public sphere.\n\nMajar served as a priest in Slovene-speaking parishes in Carinthia, first in Rosegg and then in the settlement of Camporosso near Tarvisio in the Canale Valley (now in Italy). In 1837, he moved back to Klagenfurt, where he first worked in the administration of the Diocese of Gurk, and from 1843 as the chaplain of Klagenfurt Cathedral. During his Klagenfurt years, Majar came into contact with several Slovene ethnographers and authors who worked on the revival of the Slovene language and culture, such as Urban Jarnik, Anton Janežič, Matija Ahacel, and Davorin Trstenjak. Influenced by the Illyrian Movement in Croatia, especially by the Slovene-Croatian poet and activist Stanko Vraz, Majar started developing Pan-Slavic ideals.\n\nIn the early days of the revolution of 1848, Majar formulated and published a political manifesto demanding the unification of all Slovene Lands into one single politically autonomous administrative entity, called Slovenia. In the following months, Majar's manifesto was elaborated into a program known under the name of \"United Slovenia\".\n\nBecause of his radical political activity, Majar was transferred from Klagenfurt to the remote parish of Hohenthurn () on the border with Friuli. After more than decade in isolation, in 1867 Majar took part in a journey to Moscow later nicknamed the \"Slavic Pilgrimage\", where he presented the Gail Valley at the Ethnographic Exhibition. Through this four-week absence without leave from his parish he completely fell out with the church authorities. Majar then returned to public life. He even tried to introduce the Cyrillic script among Slovenes. He published his ethnographic research in several Russian journals, and in 1870, he was offered tenure as professor in Odessa, in the Russian Empire. However, since he was still a Roman Catholic priest, this plan failed as the Russian authorities did not grant him entry to the country. Nevertheless, Majar continued to propagate radical pan-Slavic ideas through the magazine \"Slavjan\" (The Slav), which he had founded in 1873. The magazine had limited success and was closed in 1875. In 1885, Majar moved to Prague, where he lived until his death in 1892.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44313092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44313092", "title": "Procedural rhetoric", "text": "Procedural rhetoric\n\nProcedural rhetoric or simulation rhetoric is a rhetorical concept that explains how people learn through the authorship of rules and processes. The theory argues that games can make strong claims about how the world works—not simply through words or visuals but through the processes they embody and models they construct.The term was first coined by Ian Bogost in his 2007 book Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames.\n\nBogost is a professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication and in Interactive Computing in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he is the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts Distinguished Chair in Media Studies.\n\nBogost argues that games make strong claims about how the world works by the processes they embody. Procedural rhetoric analyzes the art of persuasion by rule based representations and interactions rather than spoken or written word. Procedural rhetoric focuses on how gamemakers craft laws and rules within a game to convey a particular ideology.\n\nThe term “procedural rhetoric” was developed by Ian Bogost in his book \"Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames\". Bogost defines procedural rhetoric as “the art of persuasion through rule-based representations and interactions, rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or moving pictures” and “the art of using processes persuasively.” Though Gonzalo Frasca’s preferred term of “simulation rhetoric” uses different language, the concept is the same: he envisions the authors of games as crafting laws and that these authors convey ideology “by adding or leaving out manipulation rules.” Frasca defines simulations as “to model a (source) system through a different system which maintains (for somebody) some of the behaviors of the original system,” a definition that shows the importance of systemic procedures.\n\nIn coining this term, Bogost borrows Janet Murray’s definition of procedural from her book \"Hamlet on the Holodeck\"—“a defining ability to execute a series of rules”—to theorize that a different system of learning and persuasion could be found in computerized media. As Bogost suggests, “This ability to execute computationally a series of rules fundamentally separates computers from other media.” Frasca likewise sees the need for new rhetorical theory because “simulations can express messages in ways that narrative simply cannot.” In procedural rhetoric, these rules of behavior then create “possibility spaces, which can be explored through play.”\n\nProcedural rhetoric also views games as strongly rhetorical—we “read games as deliberate expressions of particular perspectives.” The exploration of possibility spaces becomes rhetorical and instructive as soon as games make claims about aspects of human experience, whether they do so intentionally or inadvertently. Frasca concurs that “video games are capable of conveying the ideas and feelings of an author” and “offer distinct rhetorical possibilities.” Game laws represent “the designer's agenda.” As Bogost traces the history of rhetoric back to classical Greece, he argues that, as theories of rhetoric have expanded from examining only verbal to including written and visual media, an expansion of rhetoric is now necessary to include the properties of procedural expression: “A theory of procedural rhetoric is needed to make commensurate judgments about the software systems we encounter everyday and to allow a more sophisticated procedural authorship with both persuasion and expression as its goal […] Procedural rhetoric affords a new and promising way to make claims about how things work.” As Matt King summarizes the procedural and rhetorical sides of this theory, “By embodying certain processes and not others, by structuring a playing experience around particular rules and logics, videogames make claims about the world and how it works–or how it does not work, or how it should work.”\n\nBogost overwhelmingly uses video games as the medium to clarify this concept because “they embody processes and rely upon players to enact them.” However, he does suggest that this theory could apply to other types of “play” and their possibility spaces: “For example, consider a game of hide-and-seek in which an older player must count for a longer time to allow younger players a better chance to hide more cleverly. This rule is not merely instrumental; it suggests a value of equity in the game and its players.” Similarly, procedural rhetoric would apply to board games such as Elizabeth Magie’s \"The Landlord Game\", a forerunner of \"Monopoly (game)\", that was designed to educate players on the negative outcomes of capitalism. Frasca is much more explicit about the historical use of procedural rhetoric: “Simulation is not a new tool. It has always been present through such common things as toys and games but also through scientific models or cybertexts like the \"I-Ching\".”\n\nAlthough Bogost and Frasca use different terms, their descriptions of this new type of rhetoric should be considered synonymous. Bogost sees procedural rhetoric in contrast to theories of verbal, written, and visual rhetoric, while Frasca coins the term “simulation rhetoric” to compare with narrative and drama as a form of representational storytelling. As he explains, “It is common to contrast narrative and drama because the former is the form of the past, of what cannot be changed, while the latter unfolds in present time. To take the analogy further, simulation is the form of the future. It does not deal with what happened or is happening, but with what may happen. Unlike narrative and drama, its essence lays on a basic assumption: change is possible.” The ways in which they discuss their concepts are nevertheless almost identical.\n\nExpanding from the fundamental concepts of Procedural Rhetoric, where the core concepts deal with rhetoric as means of learning through rules and processes, there are extensions of other theories that contribute to the functionality of Procedural Rhetoric. In her article \"Game-based Pedagogy in the Writing Classroom\", Rebekah Schultz Colby, outlines how \"games\" can essentially be beneficial towards improving an individual's skill due to the nature of \"Multimodal interaction,\" or better defined as \"Multimodal Systems\" in the article. Though Schultz, only focuses on core principles of games and the effect of game instructions, this approach relates to Ian Bogost's theory on how a pedagogical rule-based system can effect the outcome of a persons performance. Moreover, between the similarities of Bogost and Schultz's theories, it can be noted that there is a correlation between the rule based system, and the improvements of a persons skills.\n\nRhetoric is the art of discourse wherein a writer or speaker strives to inform, persuade or motivate particular audiences in specific situations. Procedural rhetoric focuses on the composition of gameplay, more specifically how simulation games are constructed to make claims about how the world should work.\n\nJames Gee, Professor at University of Wisconsin - Madison outlined the importance of video games for learning in his essay Why Video Games are Good For Learning, Gee describes commercial games as “worlds in which variables interact through time” . Game-makers compose video games with a series of predetermined rules and processes that the play must follow in order to win. The player must learn the rules of the virtual world and deduce what is possible and impossible in order to solve problems and carry out the ultimate goal of winning. The requirement of learning the rules of video games is the baseline of the procedural rhetoric theory.\n\nResearchers Jens Seiffert and Howard Nothhaft found that computer games are powerful persuasive tools that act as a manipulating force for society. The researchers cited a 2009 study finding that military computer games transferred to the players understanding of warfare. In particular, the logic of the game revealed by the procedural and structural rules guided players with a deeper comprehension of the rules of warfare and tactics in real life.\n\nThrough the processes and rules of a simulation, game-makers have the ability to persuade players to view the world according to the procedures of a particular game. While contemporary rhetorics focuses on discourse as the art of persuasion, procedural rhetorics focuses on the gaming system, processes, rules, and procedures as a mean to persuade the audience, that being players.\n\nElements of Procedural Rhetoric can also be found outside of video games. For example, Bogost references Bureaucratic processes that involve computers, such as banking. In banking, the actions available to account holders are limited and directed by the procedures built into the banking system such as interest, fees, credit, and money transfers. These factors incentivise account holders to take a variety of specific actions, such as spending to improve credit, saving to accrue interest, and more.\n\nAlec Slade Baker of San Diego State University argues that procedural rhetoric be used to study capitalist systems as well. In his masters dissertation, \"Civilization and Its Contents: Procedural Rhetoric, Nationalism, and Civilization V\", he examines the rhetorical arguments created by customer service return policies at a variety of commercial businesses. According to him, forgiving return policies, Nordstrom’s communicate to customers a willingness to help and accommodate. On the other hand, strict return policies such as that of Dollar Tree reflect a hostile distrust of the customer that impacts the way they interact with those businesses.\n\nLucille A. Jewel of the University of Tennessee College of Law theorizes uses for procedural rhetoric in the courtroom setting in her scholarly article, \"The Bramble Bush of Forking Paths: Digital Narrative\". According to her, games or other interactive media could be used in the future to help explain complex legal concepts to juries, taking over the role that videos or other supplemental media now hold. This is because interactive media that uses procedural rhetoric can better illustrate the complexities of law on a case-by-case basis than static media.\n\nAlong with the development of Procedural Rhetoric in the greater Digital Rhetoric discourse, several counter-arguments critiquing the theory have been made as well. For example, Mike Treanor and Michael Mateas of the University of California, Santa Cruz critiqued the concept of procedural rhetoric in their conference paper, \"Newsgames: Procedural Rhetoric meets Political Cartoons\", claiming that the concept gave too much credit to game creators who often didn’t take the rhetoric supported by their systems into account during game design. For example, the 2004 flash game \"Madrid\" by Gonzalo Frasca, created as a procedural rhetoric device discussing the 2004 Madrid train bombings, features a gameplay system that promotes frenetic, consistent, stressful action which is in direct opposition to the goal of creating empathy between the players and the people who were harmed.\n\nAnother major critique of Procedural Rhetoric is expressed by Miguel Sicart of the IT University of Copenhagen in his journal article, \"Against Procedurality\". Sicart disagrees with Procedural Rhetoric because of how it focuses completely on the creator’s engineered experiences and systems, while ignoring the ability of the player to interact and change procedural systems in unforeseen ways. Specifically, he claims that the unique interests and goals of each player have the power to radically change the play experience, regardless of the author’s intent.\n\nBogost describes three prominent categories through which procedural rhetoric manifests itself in video games: politics, advertising, and education. Frasca also suggests examples of rhetoric in each of these categories.\n\nPolitics\n\nAlthough perhaps not overwhelmingly common, a number of games have made political arguments. Bogost shows the potential effect of procedural rhetoric on political values through \"The Howard Dean for Iowa Game\". He discusses how this game represents the “procedural rhetoric of politics,” claiming that “one amasses supporters in support of nothing more than support.” Bogost also sees political content in the government-funded first-person shooter \"America’s Army\", arguing that the game “serves as a convincing procedural rhetoric for the chain of command, the principle structure new recruits must understand immediately.” America’s Army therefore privileges government values and authority, suggesting to players that they should uncritically accept the missions they are provided. Frasca cites a 2002 CBS report that Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura considered using video games for propaganda and mentions the wave of anti-Osama video games that erupted online after September 11, 2001.\n\nAdvertising\nRhetoric focuses on persuasion, so it is no surprise that advertising would be present in some examples of procedural rhetoric. Bogost describes a possible effect of advertising procedural rhetoric in the game \"Animal Crossing\". Although the game is targeted to children, there are certain rare things in the game that can only be found during the late hours of the night, meaning that the child would have to ask permission to acquire this rare item or enlist the help of parent(s) to acquire it. Bogost argues that this could be incentivized by the parents—for example, “do your chores and I will let you stay up to get it”—which shows the persuasive effect video games could have on both the parent and the child. Frasca sees advertising as especially prevalent in procedural rhetoric, arguing that advertisers “see in games a tool for persuasion” and noting the prevalence of product-based “advergames.” Advergames make it especially clear that games in general contain ideological content because players understand that advergames have an explicit agenda.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation and instruction is an inherent theme of procedural rhetoric; players learn from seeing their behaviors rewarded or punished. Bogost uses the \"SeaWorld Adventure Parks Tycoon\" game (one of a number of simulation games about managing business franchises) as an example of the educational value of procedural rhetoric. In these games the player is tasked with creating a theme park, zoo, or other business and making it profitable. Although such games allow players to develop their businesses as they see fit, they ultimately require a successful business to progress and keep playing. This feedback process forces the player to learn how to manage a business and grow in knowledge as they play. Frasca mentions the simulation games \"SimCity\" and \"The Sims\" as examples of procedural rhetoric and uses the handling of same-sex relationships as an example:\n“[T]he way that \"The Sims\"'s designers dealt with gay couples was not just through representation (for example, by allowing players to put gay banners on their yards), they also decided to build a rule about it. In this game, same-gender relationships are possible. […] By incorporating this rule, the designers are showing tolerance towards this sexual option.”\n\n"}
{"id": "894368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=894368", "title": "Productivity (linguistics)", "text": "Productivity (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, productivity is the degree to which native speakers use a particular grammatical process, especially in word formation. It compares grammatical processes that are in frequent use to less frequently used ones that tend towards lexicalization. Generally the test of productivity concerns identifying which grammatical forms would be used in the coining of new words: these will tend to only be converted to other forms using productive processes.\n\nIn standard English, the formation of preterite and past participle forms of verbs by means of ablaut (for example, \"sing\"–\"sang\"–\"sung\") is no longer considered productive. Newly coined verbs in English overwhelmingly use the 'weak' (regular) ending \"-ed\" for the past tense and past participle (for example, \"spammed\", \"e-mailed\"). Similarly, the only clearly productive plural ending is \"-(e)s\"; it is found on the vast majority of English count nouns and is used to form the plurals of neologisms, such as \"FAQs\" and \"Muggles\". The ending \"-en\", on the other hand, is no longer productive, being found only in \"oxen\", \"children\", and the now-rare \"brethren\". Because these old forms can sound incorrect to modern ears, regularization can wear away at them until they are no longer used: \"brethren\" has now been replaced with the more regular-sounding \"brothers\" except when talking about religious orders. It appears that many strong verbs were completely lost during the transition from Old English to Middle English, possibly because they sounded archaic or were simply no longer truly understood.\n\nIn both cases, however, occasional exceptions have occurred. A false analogy with other verbs caused \"dug\" to become thought of as the 'correct' preterite and past participle form of \"dig\" (the conservative King James Bible preferred \"digged\" in 1611) and more recent examples, like \"snuck\" from \"sneak\" and \"dove\" from \"dive\", have similarly become popular. Some American English dialects also use the non-standard \"drug\" as the past tense of \"drag\".\n\nSince use to produce novel (new, non-established) structures is the clearest proof of usage of a grammatical process, the evidence most often appealed to as establishing productivity is the appearance of novel forms of the type the process leads one to expect, and many people would limit the definition offered above to exclude use of a grammatical process that does not result in a novel structure. Thus in practice, and, for many, in theory, productivity is the degree to which native speakers use a particular grammatical process \"for the formation of novel structures\". A productive grammatical process defines an open class, one which admits new words or forms. Non-productive grammatical processes may be seen as operative within closed classes: they remain within the language and may include very common words, but are not added to and may be lost in time or through regularization converting them into what now seems to be a correct form.\n\nProductivity is, as stated above and implied in the examples already discussed, a matter of degree, and there are a number of areas in which that may be shown to be true. As the example of \"-en\" becoming productive shows, what has apparently been non-productive for many decades or even centuries may suddenly come to some degree of productive life, and it may do so in certain dialects or sociolects while not in others, or in certain parts of the vocabulary but not others. Some patterns are only very rarely productive, others may be used by a typical native speaker several times a year or month, whereas others (especially syntactic processes) may be used productively dozens or hundreds of times in a typical day. It is not atypical for more than one pattern with similar functions to be comparably productive, to the point that a speaker can be in a quandary as to which form to use —e.g., would it be better to say that a taste or color like that of raisins is \"raisinish\", \"raisiny\", \"raisinlike\", or even \"raisinly\"? \n\nIt can also be very difficult to assess when a given usage is productive or when a person is using a form that has already been learned as a whole. Suppose a reader comes across an unknown word such as \"despisement\" meaning \"an attitude of despising\". The reader may apply the verb+\"ment\" noun-formational process to understand the word perfectly well, and this would be a kind of productive use. This would be essentially independent of whether or not the writer had also used the same process productively in coining the term, or whether he or she had learned the form from previous usage (as most English speakers have learned \"government\", for instance), and no longer needed to apply the process productively in order to use the word. Similarly a speaker or writer's use of words like \"raisinish\" or \"raisiny\" may or may not involve productive application of the noun+\"ish\" and noun+\"y\" rules, and the same is true of a hearer or reader's understanding of them. But it will not necessarily be at all clear to an outside observer, or even to the speaker and hearer themselves, whether the form was already learnt and whether the rules were applied or not.\n\nDevelopments over the last five hundred years or more have meant English has developed in ways very different from the evolution of most world languages across history. English is a language with a long written past that has preserved many words that might otherwise have been lost or changed, often in fixed texts such as the King James Version of the Bible which are not updated regularly to modernise their language. English also has many conventions for writing polite and formal prose, which are often very different from how people normally speak. As literacy among native English speakers has become almost universal, it has become increasingly easy for people to bring back into life archaic words and grammar forms, often to create a comic or humorously old-fashioned effect, with the expectation that these new coinings will be understandable. These processes would be much rarer for languages without a culture of literacy.\n\nEnglish has also borrowed extensively from other languages because of technology and trade, often borrowing plural forms as well as singular ones into standard English. For example, the plural of \"radius\" (from Latin) has not decisively settled between \"radiuses\" and the original Latin \"radii\", though educated opinion prefers the latter. In some cases, new words have been coined from these bases (often Latin) on the same rules.\n\nOne study, which focuses on the usage of the Dutch suffix -heid (comparable to -ness in English) hypothesizes that -heid gives rise to two kinds of abstract nouns: those referring to concepts and those referring to states of affairs. It shows that the referential function of -heid is typical for the lowest-frequency words, while its conceptual function is typical for the highest-frequency words. It claims that high-frequency formations with the suffix -heid are available in the mental lexicon, whereas low-frequency words and neologisms are produced and understood by rule.\n\n\n"}

For example in machine translation changing the part-of-speech of a word can dramatically change its translation.\n\nSliding window based part-of-speech taggers are programs which assign a single part-of-speech to a given lexical form of a word, by looking at a fixed sized \"window\" of words around the word to be disambiguated.\n\nThe two main advantages of this approach are:\n\n\nLet\n\nbe the set of grammatical tags of the application, that is, the set of all possible tags which may be assigned to a word, and let\n\nbe the vocabulary of the application. Let \n\nbe a function for morphological analysis which assigns each formula_4 its set of possible tags, formula_5, that can be implemented by a full-form lexicon, or a morphological analyser. Let\n\nbe the set of word classes, that in general will be a partition of formula_7 with the restriction that for each formula_8 all of the words formula_9 will receive the same set of tags, that is, all of the words in each word class formula_10 belong to the same ambiguity class.\n\nNormally, formula_11 is constructed in a way that for high frequency words, each word class contains a single word, while for low frequency words, each word class corresponds to a single ambiguity class. This allows good performance for high frequency ambiguous words, and doesn't require too many parameters for the tagger.\n\nWith these definitions it is possible to state problem in the following way: Given a text formula_12 each word formula_13 is assigned a word class formula_14 (either by using the lexicon or morphological analyser) in order to get an ambiguously tagged text formula_15. The job of the tagger is to get a tagged text formula_16 (with formula_17) as correct as possible.\n\nA statistical tagger looks for the most probable tag for an ambiguously tagged text formula_18:\n\nUsing Bayes formula, this is converted into:\n\nwhere formula_21 is the probability that a particular tag (syntactic probability) and formula_22 is the probability that this tag corresponds to the text formula_23 (lexical probability).\n\nIn a Markov model, these probabilities are approximated as products. The syntactic probabilities are modelled by a first order Markov process:\n\nwhere formula_25 and formula_26 are delimiter symbols.\n\nLexical probabilities are independent of context:\n\nOne form of tagging is to approximate the first probability formula:\n\nwhere formula_29 is the right context of the size formula_30.\n\nIn this way the sliding window algorithm only has to take into account a context of size formula_31. For most applications formula_32. For example to tag the ambiguous word \"run\" in the sentence \"He runs from danger\", only the tags of the words \"He\" and \"from\" are needed to be taken into account.\n\n"}

For example, \"crooked\" has connotations in English that it may lack in the original.\n\n\nSome sources add:\n\n\nOf these nine or ten opposites, many philosophers have seized on the third pair as one of the most profound questions in philosophy. Is the universe one? Then how is it diverse? Is the universe many? Then how is it unified?

{"id": "16116497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16116497", "title": "Tocharian alphabet", "text": "Tocharian alphabet\n\nThe Tocharian alphabet is a version of Brahmi script used to write the Central Asian Indo-European Tocharian languages, mostly from the 8th century (with a few earlier ones) that were written on palm leaves, wooden tablets and Chinese paper, preserved by the extremely dry climate of the Tarim Basin. Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in Kucha and Karasahr, including many mural inscriptions.\n\nTocharian A and B are not mutually intelligible. Properly speaking, based on the tentative interpretation of \"twqry\" as related to \"Tokharoi\", only Tocharian A may be referred to as \"Tocharian\", while Tocharian B could be called \"Kuchean\" (its native name may have been \"kuśiññe\"), but since their grammars are usually treated together in scholarly works, the terms A and B have proven useful. A common Proto-Tocharian language must precede the attested languages by several centuries, probably dating to the 1st millennium BC. Given the small geographical range of and the lack of secular texts in Tocharian A, it might alternatively have been a liturgical language, the relationship between the two being similar to that between Classical Chinese and Mandarin. However, the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is by no means definite, due to the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.\n\nThe alphabet the Tocharians were using is derived from the Brahmi alphabetic syllabary (abugida) and is referred to as \"slanting Brahmi\". It soon became apparent that a large proportion of the manuscripts were translations of known Buddhist works in Sanskrit and some of them were even bilingual, facilitating decipherment of the new language. Besides the Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts, there were also monastery correspondence and accounts, commercial documents, caravan permits, and medical and magical texts, and one love poem. Many Tocharians embraced Manichaean duality or Buddhism.\n\nIn 1998, Chinese linguist Ji Xianlin published a translation and analysis of fragments of a Tocharian Maitreyasamiti-Nataka discovered in 1974 in Yanqi.\n\nTocharian script probably died out after 840, when the Uyghurs were expelled from Mongolia by the Kyrgyz, retreating to the Tarim Basin. This theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur. During Uyghur rule, the peoples mixed with the Uyghurs to produce much of the modern population of what is now Xinjiang.\n\nThe Tocharian script is based on Brahmi, where each consonant has an inherent vowel, which can be altered by adding a vowel mark, or removed with a special nullifying mark, the virama. Like Brahmi, Tocharian uses stacking for conjunct consonants, and has irregular conjunct forms of , ra.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "32129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32129", "title": "Universal Decimal Classification", "text": "Universal Decimal Classification\n\nThe Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is a bibliographic and library classification representing the systematic arrangement of all branches of human knowledge organized as a coherent system in which knowledge fields are related and inter-linked. The UDC is an analytico-synthetic and faceted classification system featuring detailed vocabulary and syntax that enables powerful content indexing and information retrieval in large collections. Since 1991, the UDC has been owned and managed by the UDC Consortium, a non-profit international association of publishers with headquarters in The Hague (Netherlands).\n\nUnlike other library classification schemes that have started their life as national systems, the UDC was conceived and maintained as an international scheme. Its translation in world languages started at the beginning of the 20th century and has since been published in various printed editions in over 40 languages. UDC Summary, an abridged Web version of the scheme is available in over 50 languages. The classification has been modified and extended over the years to cope with increasing output in all areas of human knowledge, and is still under continuous review to take account of new developments.\n\nAlbeit originally designed as an indexing and retrieval system, due to its logical structure and scalability, UDC has become one of the most widely used knowledge organization systems in libraries, where it is used for either shelf arrangement, content indexing or both. UDC codes can describe any type of document or object to any desired level of detail. These can include textual documents and other media such as films, video and sound recordings, illustrations, maps as well as realia such as museum objects.\n\nThe UDC was developed by the Belgian bibliographers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine at the end of the 19th century. In 1895, they created the Universal Bibliographic Repertory (\"Répertoire Bibliographique Universel\") (RBU) which was intended to become a comprehensive classified index to all published information. The idea that the RBU should take the form of a card catalogue came from the young American zoologist Herbert Haviland Field, who was at the time himself setting up a bibliographical agency in Zurich, the Concilium Bibliographicum. A means of arranging the entries would be needed, and Otlet, having heard of the Dewey Decimal Classification, wrote to Melvil Dewey and obtained permission to translate it into French. The idea outgrew the plan of mere translation, and a number of radical innovations were made, adapting the purely enumerative classification (in which all the subjects envisaged are already listed and coded) into one which allows for synthesis (that is, the construction of compound numbers to denote interrelated subjects that could never be exhaustively foreseen); various possible relations between subjects were identified, and symbols assigned to represent them. In its first edition in French \"Manuel du Répertoire bibliographique universel\" (1905), the UDC already included many features that were revolutionary in the context of knowledge classifications: tables of generally applicable (aspect-free) concepts—called common auxiliary tables; a series of special auxiliary tables with specific but re-usable attributes in a particular field of knowledge; an expressive notational system with connecting symbols and syntax rules to enable coordination of subjects and the creation of a documentation language proper.\n\nThe Universal Bibliographic Repertory itself has developed into a remarkable information resource. In the period before World War I it grew to more than 11 million records. The catalogue and its content organized by UDC can still be seen in Mundaneum in Mons, Belgium (in 2013 recommended for inclusion in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register).\n\nUDC is used in around 150,000 libraries in 130 countries and in many bibliographical services which require detailed content indexing. In a number of countries it is the main classification system for information exchange and is used in all types of libraries: public, school, academic and special libraries.\n\nUDC is also used in national bibliographies of around 30 countries. Examples of large databases indexed by UDC include: \n\nUDC has traditionally been used for the indexing of scientific articles which was an important source of information of scientific output in the period predating electronic publishing. Collections of research articles in many countries covering decades of scientific output contain UDC codes. Examples of journal articles indexed by UDC:\nThe design of UDC lends itself to machine readability, and the system has been used both with early automatic mechanical sorting devices, and modern library OPACs. Since 1993, a standard version of UDC has been maintained and distributed in a database format: UDC Master Reference File (UDC MRF) which is updated and released regularly. The 2011 version of the MRF (released in 2012) contains over 70,000 classes. In the past full printed editions used to have around 220,000 subdivisions.\n\nA notation is a code commonly used in classification schemes to represent a class, i.e. a subject and its position in the hierarchy, to enable mechanical sorting and filing of subjects. UDC uses Arabic numerals arranged decimally. Every number is thought of as a decimal fraction with the initial decimal point omitted, which determines the filing order. An advantage of decimal notational systems is that they are infinitely extensible, and when new subdivisions are introduced, they need not disturb the existing allocation of numbers. For ease of reading, a UDC notation is usually punctuated after every third digit:\nIn UDC the notation has two features that make the scheme easier to browse and work with: \n\nUDC is an analytico-synthetic and faceted classification. It allows an unlimited combination of attributes of a subject and relationships between subjects to be expressed. UDC codes from different tables can be combined to present various aspects of document content and form, e.g. 94(410)\"19\"(075) History \"(main subject)\" of United Kingdom \"(place)\" in 20th century \"(time)\", a textbook \"(document form)\". Or: 37:2 Relationship between Education and Religion. Complex UDC expressions can be accurately parsed into constituent elements.\n\nUDC is also a disciplinary classification covering the entire universe of knowledge. This type of classification can also be described as \"aspect\" or \"perspective\", which means that concepts are subsumed and placed under the field in which they are studied. Thus, the same concept can appear in different fields of knowledge. This particular feature is usually implemented in UDC by re-using the same concept in various combinations with the main subject, e.g. a code for language in common auxiliaries of language is used to derive numbers for ethnic grouping, individual languages in linguistics and individual literatures. Or, a code from the auxiliaries of place, e.g. \"(410) United Kingdom\", uniquely representing the concept of United Kingdom can be used to express \"911(410) Regional geography of United Kingdom\" and \"94(410) History of United Kingdom\".\n\nConcepts are organized in two kinds of tables in UDC:\n\n\n\nThe vacant class 4 is the result of a planned schedule expansion. This class was freed by moving linguistics into class 8 in the 1960s to make space for future developments in the rapidly expanding fields of knowledge; primarily natural sciences and technology.\n\n\"Common auxiliaries\" are aspect-free concepts that can be used in combination with any other UDC code from the main classes or with other common auxiliaries. They have unique notational representations that makes them stand out in complex expressions. Common auxiliary numbers always begin with a certain symbol known as a facet indicator, e.g. <nowiki>=</nowiki> (equal sign) always introduces concepts representing the language of a document; (0...) numbers enclosed in parentheses starting with zero always represent a concept designating document form. Thus (075) Textbook and =111 English can be combined to express, e.g.(075)=111 Textbooks in English, and when combined with numbers from the main UDC tables they can be used as follows: 2(075)=111 Religion textbooks in English, 51(075)=111 Mathematics textbooks in English etc.\n\n\nIn order to preserve the precise meaning and enable accurate parsing of complex UDC expressions, a number of connecting symbols are made available to relate and extend UDC numbers. These are:\n\n 00 Prolegomena. Fundamentals of knowledge and culture. Propaedeutics\n\n 101 Nature and role of philosophy\n\n \"2-1/-9 Special auxiliary subdivision for religion\"\n\n 303 Methods of the social sciences\n\nThis section is currently vacant.\n\n 502/504 Environmental science.

Whitetopping is divided into types depending on the thickness of the concrete layer and whether the layer is bonded to the asphalt substrate. Unbonded whitetopping, also called conventional whitetopping, uses concrete thicknesses of eight inches or more that is not bonded to the asphalt. Bonded whitetopping uses thicknesses of two to six inches bonded to the asphalt pavement and is divided into two types, thin and ultrathin. The bond is made by texturing the asphalt. Thin whitetopping uses a bonded layer of concrete that is four to six inches thick while an ultrathin layer is two to four inches thick. Ultrathin whitetopping is suitable for light duty uses, such as roads with low traffic volume, parking lots and small airports. Fiber reinforced concrete is used in some thin whitetopping overlays and almost all ultrathin whitetopping overlays.\n\nWhitetopping is suitable for asphalt pavement with little deterioration, although repairs can be made to the asphalt if necessary. If the pavement is badly damaged, it should be completely removed and a new concrete pavement should be installed. The pavement should be relatively hard, as well. Deterioration of overlays is significantly increased on asphalt bases with high viscosity. If a grade or a distance between the pavement and a bridge needs to be preserved, the asphalt can be milled so that the height of the pavement does not change. However, whitetopping requires the asphalt layer to be at least three inches thick. If necessary, a section of new concrete roadway can be placed under a bridge with gentle slopes on either side that meet up with the whitetopped portions of the road. \n\n\n"}
