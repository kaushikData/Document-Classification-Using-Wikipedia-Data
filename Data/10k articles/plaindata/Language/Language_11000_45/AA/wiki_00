{"id": "6158798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6158798", "title": "Academic probation", "text": "Academic probation\n\nAcademic probation in the United Kingdom is a period served by a new academic staff member at a university or college when they are first given their job. It is specified in the conditions of employment of the staff member, and may vary from person to person and from institution to institution. In universities founded prior to the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, it is usually three years for academic staff and six months to a year for other staff. In the universities created by that Act, and in colleges of higher education, the period is generally just a year across the board, for both academic and other staff.\n\nProbation is generally monitored by a probationary supervisor, who meets with the probationer both formally, for formal reviews, and informally over the probation period. This is not the same role as a mentor, whose task is to provide consultation and advice during the first few months of a staff member's employment. Typical tasks performed by a mentor, when not performed by people such as a departmental officer nominated for the purpose, are things such as pointing out departmental health and safety information (such as fire drills, for example). The probationary supervisor, in contrast, follows the organization's formal probation scheme, monitoring the probationer's work; setting out work goals, standards of work, and training needs; and organizing reviews to ensure that standards are met and goals are achieved.\nThe extended length of the probationary period in universities prior to the FHE Act 1992 is the result of an agreement made in 1974 between the University Authorities Panel and the Association of University Teachers, the Academic and Related Salaries Settlement. The working party that formed the agreement stated that the purpose of academic probation was to decide, at the end of the probationary period whether a member of staff should be retained, and that this decision is based upon \"the long-term interests of the university itself, of the other members of its staff, and of its students\". The working group set out several criteria that a probationer was expected to satisfy:\nIt was decided that in practice, evaluating whether a probationer satisfied such criteria would take at least three years, although it was possible for it to take just one or two in rare, exceptional, cases. Also stipulated by the agreement was the fact that completion of academic probation at one university should count towards probation at other institutions, and that it was unreasonable to impose second or third probationary periods.\n\nHowever, this stipulation does not cover the shorter, one year, probationary period used by universities that came after the FHA Act 1992. That shorter period resulted from a 1990/1991 agreement between teaching unions and the then polytechnics and colleges that were later to become universities under the Act. It was modified by various local agreements with individual institutions. (Middlesex University, for example, has an eight-month academic probation period as a result of a local agreement.) In such universities, the focus of academic probation is less upon the performance research and other scholarly work, and more upon the performance of teaching work. The universities can, for example, require several formal observations of a probationer's teaching practices, for assessment and review. (Middlesex University requires two, for example.)\n\n"}

This language is also spoken by Acehnese descendants in some parts of Malaysia like Yan, in Kedah.\n\nAs of 1988, \"Acehnese\" is the modern English name spelling and the bibliographical standard, and Acehnese people use the spelling \"Acehnese\" when writing in English. \"Achinese\" is an antiquated spelling of the English language tradition. \"Atjehnese\" is the Dutch spelling and an outdated Indonesian one. The spelling \"Achehnese\" originates from a 1906 English translation of the Dutch language \"Studien over atjesche klank- en schriftleer. Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 35.346-442\" by Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, 1892. In Acehnese the language is called \"Basa/Bahsa Acèh\". In Indonesian it is called \"Bahasa Aceh\".\n\nAcehnese belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of Austronesian. Acehnese's closest relatives are the other Chamic languages, which are principally spoken in Vietnam. The closest relative of the Chamic family is the Malay language family, which includes languages also spoken in Sumatra such as Gayo, the Batak languages and Minangkabau as well as the national language, Indonesian.\n\nPaul Sidwell notes that Acehnese likely has an Austroasiatic substratum.\n\nAcehnese language is located primarily in coastal region of Aceh. This language is spoken in 13 regencies and 4 cities in Aceh, those are:\n\nCity\n\nNorth-East Coast\n\nWest-South Coast\n\nOral monophthong vowels in Acehnese are shown in the table below.\nIn addition to the modern 26 letter basic Latin alphabet, Acehnese uses the supplementary letters è, é, ë, ô, and ö, making a total of 31 letters in its orthography.\n\nThe table below shows the Acehnese consonant phonemes and the range of their realizations.\n\nNotes:\n\nAcehnese features a split ergative system. Intransitives that align with the agent of a transitive verb (Sa) always show agreement by a proclitic (1). Meanwhile, intransitives that align with the patient of a transitive verb (Sp) may optionally show agreement by an enclitic (2). Volitionality is the determining factor for whether an intransitive verb is Sa or Sp.\n\nFormerly, the Acehnese language was written in an Arabic script called Jawoë or Jawi in the Malay language. The script is less common nowadays. Since colonization by the Dutch, the Acehnese language has been written in the Latin script, with the addition of supplementary letters. The additional letters are é, è, ë, ö and ô. The sound ɨ is represented by 'eu' and the sound ʌ is represented by 'ö', respectively. The letter 'ë' is used exclusively to represent the schwa sound which forms the second part of diphthongs. The letters f, q, v, x, and z are only used in loanwords.\n\nSo far there has been no complete research about dialects of the Acehnese language. However, there are at least 10 dialects in the Acehnese language. The dialects are Pasè, Peusangan, Matang, Pidië, Buëng, Banda, Daya, Meulabôh, Seunagan and Tunong.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2742000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2742000", "title": "Alliance Quebec", "text": "Alliance Quebec\n\nAlliance Quebec (AQ) was a group formed in 1982 to lobby on behalf of English-speaking Quebecers in the province of Quebec, Canada. It began as an umbrella group of many English-speaking organizations and institutions in the province, with approximately 15,000 members. At its height in the mid-1980s, the group had a network of affiliated anglophone groups throughout the province. However, a prolonged decline in influence, group cohesion, membership and funding ultimately led to its closure in 2005.\n\nThe Parti Québécois (PQ), a party that supports the sovereignty of Quebec and the dominant use of French in most areas of public and business life, won a majority in the Quebec National Assembly (the province's legislature) in 1976. The vast majority of Quebec anglophones (i.e., Quebecers who speak English as a first language), who at that time made up approximately 13% of Quebec's population (see Language demographics of Quebec), did not support this party. Some anglophones formed local lobby groups to promote federalism and argue against new laws such as the Charter of the French Language (also known as \"Bill 101\"). After the Parti Québécois was re-elected in 1981, several of these groups (notably the \"Positive Action Committee\" and the \"Council of Quebec Minorities\") joined together in May 1982, as \"The Alliance of Language Communities in Quebec\" (or \"Alliance Québec\") in an effort to gain more influence and to start a province-level dialogue between linguistic groups.\n\nAQ's ideology reflected a desire to promote the rights and interests of the English language community while recognizing there were legitimate goals being pursued by the provincial government in promoting the French language, such promotion having strong support in the majority Francophone population. Alliance Quebec's best-known accomplishments from its earliest years included:\n\n\nThe group had widespread grassroots volunteer activity in its early years. It formed at least 20 regional chapters, including 8 in the anglophone neighbourhoods of Montreal. The federal government subsidized AQ in an effort to promote minority official language groups in the province, providing it with most of AQ's budget ($1.4 million in 1986). Similar funding was provided to French language groups outside Quebec.\n\nIn addition to AQ's regional chapters, six federally funded anglophone groups outside of Montreal became affiliated with AQ and sent delegates to its annual convention. Affiliated Quebec anglophone universities, CEGEPs and health and social service institution and community associations were also allowed to send delegates. Institutional members brought AQ substantial public policy expertise and participated in the policy formulation process.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, AQ claimed to have 40,000 people on its membership list (including members of regional associations affiliated with AQ, such as the Townshippers' Association). This led to critiques that people who did not renew their memberships were not removed from this list and that the actual number of dues-paying members hovered around 5,000.\n\nMany of Alliance Quebec's founders were active in the Liberal Party of Quebec, the main opposition party while the PQ was in government. The Liberal Party of Quebec won the provincial election of 1985, and many of AQ's initial leaders were recruited to work for the new government. Several of AQ's highly educated and bilingual early staff members went on to become Liberal cabinet ministers in later years, such as Thomas Mulcair, Kathleen Weil, and Geoffrey Kelley (Jacques-Cartier), while others served as MNAs—Russell Williams (Nelligan), Russell Copeman (NDG). While this initially gave AQ strong lobbying contacts within the government, the departure of many of the group's founding leaders eventually hurt the group. Some have argued that the 1985 election was the beginning of a decline in influence of Alliance Quebec, as English-speakers believed the new government was friendlier and so the need for AQ was lower, while the Liberals had more connections with English-speakers than the PQ and so relied less on AQ to transmit their points of view. The group also faced criticism, almost since its founding, that it was not aggressive enough in its demands.\n\nIn December 1988, AQ's offices were destroyed in a case of arson. Then-president Royal Orr sued \"Le Journal de Montréal\" and Télé-Métropole, for falsely reporting that he was the \"prime suspect\" in setting the blaze. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.\n\nAQ's weakened bargaining position was brought to prominence in 1989 when the Liberal government passed Bill 178. Although the Liberal Party had campaigned in 1985 to loosen the legal restrictions on languages other than French, Bill 178 overturned the Supreme Court's \"Ford\" decision (see above), restoring the prohibition on non-French commercial signage (with an exception for small signs inside stores). Alliance Quebec's inability to prevent the adoption of Bill 178 by the Liberal government it had perceived as an ally, opened it to criticism from the anglophone community. Right-wing critics of AQ dubbed it \"Compliance Quebec\" and \"the lamb lobby\" for its perceived unwillingness to challenge the government.\n\nInternal tension arose among the directors of AQ over the issue of denied access to English language schools in the province. Tensions increased over whether or not to support the Liberals in the Quebec general election of 1989 in spite of Bill 178. Some prominent AQ leaders urged a protest vote by anglophones, either by spoiling their ballots or voting for the upstart Equality Party that opposed the Liberals' legislation. The Equality Party won four seats in the National Assembly in 1989, but quickly lost its support due to infighting, garnering only 0.3% of the vote in 1994. Rebuffed at the ballot box, some of the Equality Party's remaining active members instead concentrated on winning elected positions in Alliance Quebec in order to have AQ promote the Equality Party's platform (notably, favouring a complete repeal of all mandatory use of French in Quebec, and partitioning Quebec in the event of independence). Public infighting between so-called \"moderates\" (sympathetic to the Liberal Party) and \"radicals\" (the remaining members of the Equality Party) within AQ throughout the 1990s, along with a gradual decrease in interest among the general Quebec population in language politics, led to the marginalization of AQ in the province's politics.\n\nWhile infighting preoccupied the board of directors and annual convention, the grassroots elements of AQ became less active. Government funding allowed for a permanent staff for the group, which relied less and less on volunteers. AQ's smallest regional chapters, in Quebec's Magdalen Islands, Lower North Shore and Baie-Comeau, closed down for lack of members, while six of the group's eight chapters on the Island of Montreal merged in order to avoid closing.\n\nIn 1996, the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec investigated alleged irregularities during the 1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum, finding among other things that votes in three mainly federalist ridings had been rejected without valid reasons. Alliance Quebec sued the Quebec government to try to force it to re-examine the rejected ballots in all 125 Quebec ridings. The trial judge ruled against AQ in 2000. AQ appealed, but ceased operations in 2005 (see below). In 2008 the Chief Electoral Officer got the court's permission to destroy the ballots after ruling that AQ's appeal had taken too long.\n\nIn May 1998, the group elected a \"radical\" president, Montreal Gazette columnist William Johnson. Previously a vocal critic of AQ, he won by rallying a group known derisively as \"angryphones\" (mainly members of the tiny Equality Party and some listeners of right wing talk radio shows, particularly the Howard Galganov show). He in turn supported Equality Party members for positions on AQ's board of directors. Unlike previous presidents, he made no attempt to meet with political leaders, preferring to conduct his lobbying through media, such as on radio talk shows. Also unlike previous presidents, who generally accepted the objectives of Bill 101 and focused on changing how it was applied, Johnson questioned the commitment to tolerance and human rights of those who supported Bill 101.\n\nAfter his election, Johnson organized two demonstrations against stores, in particular Eaton's and The Hudson's Bay Company, that did not place English on their in-store advertising (which was once again legal after amendments to the Charter of the French Language in 1994). Johnson told a crowd of demonstrators that he refused an Eaton's offer to put up English signs in their stores if AQ would quietly call off the protest, as Johnson wanted to make it a public issue. Johnson also had AQ's constitution amended to add his view that Canada's federal government should refuse to recognize a Quebec unilateral declaration of independence. Johnson also made headlines when the Entartistes threw a cream pie in his face while he marched in Montreal's 1998 Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day parade.\n\nJohnson's presidential campaign and his first six months as president temporarily brought more media attention and members to Alliance Quebec, as the PQ government and Quebec nationalist groups publicly criticized AQ's new, more confrontational tone. However, Johnson called off the group's protests in October 1998 and AQ's media coverage fell considerably, never to recover. Johnson's presidency and those of his similarly minded successors also provoked a negative reaction from the mainstream community of anglophones that formerly supported AQ. Links to the community's key healthcare, educational and community institutions vanished. Several events during these years highlighted the group's lack of support, which ultimately caused it to close down:\n\n\nAlliance Quebec was registered as a non-profit association in Quebec, with a headquarters in Montreal. Anyone could join as a member by paying a nominal fee of $5–$10. Membership entitled them to participate in the regional chapter in which they lived. Each regional chapter had its own board of directors and executive and obtained their budget mainly from membership fees.\n\nEach chapter could send 9 delegates to the annual convention, which took place each May in Montreal. In the 1990s, six chapters in central Montreal merged, which allowed the merged chapter to send up to 54 delegates. (In the William Johnson era, the West Island chapter's number of delegates was increased to reflect that it was the chapter with the second-largest number of members.) A youth commission of members under thirty years of age also existed and could send up to 18 delegates to the convention. Affiliated groups such as the Townshippers' Association could also send delegates, as could affiliated universities, hospitals and community groups. The outgoing president and board of directors were also entitled to vote at the convention, representing 41 delegates. In theory, an annual convention could have nearly 400 delegates during the 1990s. In practice, the number of delegates attending annual conventions decreased over time as membership fell and affiliated groups stopped participating; the annual convention in 1985 had about 470 delegates while each of the conventions from 1999 onward had under 100 delegates.\n\nThe annual convention chose the president and treasurer of AQ for the upcoming year. (In the William Johnson era, the president's term was lengthened to two years, although each subsequent president resigned before the end of their full two-year term.) The delegates would also choose the board of directors. Half of the forty-person board of directors of AQ would be up for election annually for a two-year term; the top twenty candidates who received the most votes being elected. The new board of directors would meet immediately after the convention to choose the remaining executive positions, including vice president, vice president \"off-island\" (meaning from outside of Montreal), secretary, and chairman of the board. The group also had an \"Advisory Council\" of prominent anglophones to advise the group on important issues from time to time, but this fell into disuse by the late 1990s.\n\nThe executives and directors were volunteer positions (although the president received a stipend.) There were also a number of paid staff members (around two dozen in 1994), such as a general director, a fundraiser, receptionists, researchers and organizers, paid for mainly from federal government grants.\n\nFor most of its existence, AQ also maintained committees to study issues. These included (at various times)committees for health and social services, education, access to English schools, youth employment, legal affairs, communication, internal rules, and membership. Some committees organized events and activities. One of these activities, \"Youth Employment Services\", became independent of AQ in the 1990s and continues to operate. Larger chapters also had some committees, especially in the group's early years.\n\n\n"}

Hai founded the restaurant and fashion company Supreme Master Ching Hai International Association. Her followers refer to her as \"Supreme Master\".\n\nChing Hai was born Hue Dang Trinh to a Vietnamese mother and a Chinese father, on 12 May 1950 in a small village in the Quảng Ngãi Province in Vietnam.\nIn 1969, she began a relationship with a German scientist. They married, but separated after two years to focus on spiritualism. In 1979, she met a Buddhist monk in Germany whom she followed for three years, but his monastery denied entry to females. She moved to India to study different religions.\n\nHai attempted to buy a copy of the Bhagavad Gita from a bookshop near the Ganges. Despite the shopkeepers' assertion that they had not got a copy, an extensive search revealed one in a sealed box. This led to rumours of her having a third eye circulating by 1982.. In 1983, she met a Vietnamese Buddhist monk in Taiwan named Jing-Xing, who ordained her in 1984 as \"Thanh Hai\", meaning \"pure ocean\".\n\nAccording to her official biography, Ching Hai was born to a well-off naturopathic family in Âu Lạc, Hanoi, Vietnam. Though raised as a Roman Catholic, she learned the basics of Buddhism from her grandmother. A Himalayas spiritual teacher showed her a particular meditation method which she named \"Quan Yin method\".\n\nHer meditations centres in American cities such as Los Angeles benefit from tax-exempt status as religious organizations. She presides over an organization which owns restaurants and sells her jewellery and clothes.\n\nHai founded the Loving Hut restaurant chains with 138 restaurants worldwide in 2014.\n\nShe launched a clothing line in New York and Paris in 1995.\n\nShe has authored picture books, such as \"The Birds in My Life\" and \"The Noble Wilds\". The books consist of photos she has taken.\n\nHer organization hosts websites which offer digital downloads of her media in 17 languages as well as a \"Celestial Shop\" which sells apparel and jewelry designed by Hai.\n\nHai has founded organizations including the Supreme Master Ching Hai International, World Peace Media, Oceans of Love Entertainment and Supreme Master Television. Her organization runs an international vegetarian restaurants chain, some of which sell her merchandise.\n\nIn late 2008 Ching Hai launched a media campaign in Australia and New Zealand asking people to \"Be Green, Go Veg, Save the Planet\".\n\nThe Supreme Master Ching Hai International Association has made submissions to the Garnaut Climate Change Review, advocating large cuts to livestock production.\n\nAccording to political scientist Patricia Thornton at the University of Oxford, the Ching Hai World Society's heavy reliance on the internet for text distribution, recruitment and information-sharing, marks the group as a transnational \"cybersect.\" Thornton claimed that the source of income behind Hai's numerous business ventures is unknown and that much of the media produced by her television programmes is heavily self-referential and promotional and aims to \"build a public record of recognition for group activities.\"\n\nHai first demonstrated the \"Immeasurable Light Meditation Center and the Way of Sound Contemplation\" or Quan Yin method of meditation in Miaoli, Taiwan. The method is very similar to the Surat Shabd Yoga method from the \"Sant Mat\" tradition.\n\nHai has said that she did not invent the Quan Yin method of meditation, but she merely \"knows\" it. In her book \"The Key of Immediate Enlightenment\" she claims that those who recite her name would become spiritually elevated.\nThe method involves meditation on the \"inner light and the inner sound of God\", or the Shabd. Hai claims that the Bible acknowledged the existence of this method and that it has been repeatedly re-used by most major religions. The Quan Yin Method requires two and a half hours of meditation per day and adherence to five precepts similar to the Five Precepts of Buddhism.\n\nBy 1996, several thousand residents of China were practitioners of the method.\n\nThe Chinese government claimed that the organization's beliefs and activities were fundamentally \"anti-communist\" and called the group a \"reactionary religious organization\".\n\nIn 2002, the manager of the Wuhan Zhongzhi Electric Testing Equipment Company was accused by the Chinese authorities of using the business as a cover to \"support heresies\" associated with the Quan Yin method. The enterprise supported thirty practitioners who \"masqueraded as employees and business associates.\" The manager was charged with using the company's offices and buildings as \"retreat sites\", organizing \"initiations\" and \"screenings\" to recruit members, and illegally printing and distributing more than 6,000 copies of heretical texts.\n\nThe Taiwan government has investigated Hai's organization for \"alleged fund-raising improprieties\", which included a transfer of $2 million outside of the country.\n\nHai gave $640,000 to Bill Clinton's Presidential Legal Expenses Trust which it returned in 1996 because of \"suspicious\" funding sources.\n\nIn 2004, an artificial island and a long boardwalk created in Biscayne National Park cost $1 million USD to remove after being illegally constructed by workers at a property owned by Ching Hai, known locally as under the pseudonym Celestia De Lamour. National Park workers replanted between 400 and 500 mangrove trees in the area once covered by the illegal boardwalk. The private property owned by Ching Hai adjacent to the national park was seized by police and later sold at auction to the village of Palmetto Bay, which planned to establish a park on the site.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Because both methods of publication are available to the general public (courthouses being open to all members of the general public, and newspapers readily available in public places such as libraries), the person to whom the notice is being issued (even if issued in a generic form, such as \"To All Heirs of John Smith, a Resident of Smith County\") is considered to have received notice even if they were not actually aware of it.\n\nAnother use of constructive notice is in the recording of deeds, mortgages, liens, and similar documents in in the United States. Since such documents are considered public information and can be accessed by any member of the public, such recordings are considered constructive notice of land conveyances or encumbrances having taken place.\n\nIn companies law the doctrine of constructive notice is a doctrine where all persons dealing with a company are deemed (or \"construed\") to have knowledge of the company's articles of association and memorandum of association. The doctrine of indoor management is an exception to this rule.\n\nThe New York City Housing Court allows use of the concept of constructive notice by either the tenant or the landlord. For example, constructive notice could be given to a landlord if a broken and unsupported metal grate on a public sidewalk collapses when stepped on by a pedestrian. The landlord is reasonably expected to know that this is a safety hazard.\nThe harshness of the doctrine of constructive notice is somewhat reduced by the \"Rule of Indoor management\" or \"Turquand's Rule\". The Rule derives its name from the case of \"Royal British Bank v Turquand\", where the defendant was the liquidator of the insolvent Cameron's Coalbrook Steam, Coal and Swansea and Loughor Railway Company. The company had borrowed from Royal British Bank by giving a bond worth £2,000.\n\nThe articles of the company stated that the directors could only borrow if authorised by a resolution of the company's general meeting, and could not borrow more than the amount specified in the resolution.\n\nThe articles were registered with Companies House so there was constructive notice. But the bank could not have known about the resolution, as they were not registrable and thus were not a public document. The bond was held valid and there was no requirement to know the company's internal workings.\n"}

This independence was proved in 1963 by Paul Cohen, complementing earlier work by Kurt Gödel in 1940.\n\nThe name of the hypothesis comes from the term \"the continuum\" for the real numbers.\nCantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain . It became the first on David Hilbert's list of important open questions that was presented at the International Congress of Mathematicians in the year 1900 in Paris. Axiomatic set theory was at that point not yet formulated. \nKurt Gödel proved in 1940 that the negation of the continuum hypothesis, i.e., the existence of a set with intermediate cardinality, could not be proved in standard set theory. The second half of the independence of the continuum hypothesis – i.e., unprovability of the nonexistence of an intermediate-sized set – was proved in 1963 by Paul Cohen.\n\nTwo sets are said to have the same \"cardinality\" or \"cardinal number\" if there exists a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between them. Intuitively, for two sets \"S\" and \"T\" to have the same cardinality means that it is possible to \"pair off\" elements of \"S\" with elements of \"T\" in such a fashion that every element of \"S\" is paired off with exactly one element of \"T\" and vice versa. Hence, the set {banana, apple, pear} has the same cardinality as {yellow, red, green}.\n\nWith infinite sets such as the set of integers or rational numbers, the existence of a bijection between two sets becomes more difficult to demonstrate. The rational numbers seemingly form a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis: the integers form a proper subset of the rationals, which themselves form a proper subset of the reals, so intuitively, there are more rational numbers than integers and more real numbers than rational numbers. However, this intuitive analysis is flawed; it does not take proper account of the fact that all three sets are infinite. It turns out the rational numbers can actually be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and therefore the set of rational numbers is the same size (\"cardinality\") as the set of integers: they are both countable sets.\n\nCantor gave two proofs that the cardinality of the set of integers is strictly smaller than that of the set of real numbers (see Cantor's first uncountability proof and Cantor's diagonal argument). His proofs, however, give no indication of the extent to which the cardinality of the integers is less than that of the real numbers. Cantor proposed the continuum hypothesis as a possible solution to this question.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis states that the set of real numbers has minimal possible cardinality which is greater than the cardinality of the set of integers. That is, every set, \"S\", of real numbers can either be mapped one-to-one into the integers or the real numbers can be mapped one-to-one into \"S\". Using the fact that the real numbers are equinumerous with the powerset of the integers, the continuum hypothesis says that there is no set formula_1 for which formula_2\n\nAssuming the axiom of choice, there is a smallest cardinal number formula_3 greater than formula_4, and the continuum hypothesis is in turn equivalent to the equality formula_5\n\nThere is also a generalization of the continuum hypothesis called the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) which says that for every ordinal α, formula_6 That is, GCH asserts that the cardinality of the power set of each infinite set is the smallest cardinality greater than that of the set.\n\nThe independence of the continuum hypothesis (CH) from Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) follows from combined work of Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen.\n\nCohen (1963, 1964) showed that CH cannot be proven from the ZFC axioms, completing the overall independence proof. To prove his result, Cohen developed the method of forcing, which has become a standard tool in set theory. Essentially, this method begins with a model of ZF in which CH holds, and constructs another model which contains more sets than the original, in a way that CH does not hold in the new model. Cohen was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 for his proof.\n\nThe independence proof just described shows that CH is independent of ZFC. Further research has shown that CH is independent of all known \"large cardinal axioms\" in the context of ZFC. () Moreover, it has been shown that the cardinality of the continuum can be any cardinal consistent with König's theorem. A result of Solovay, proved shortly after Cohen's result on the independence of the continuum hypothesis, shows that in any model of ZFC, if formula_7 is a cardinal of uncountable cofinality, then there is a forcing extension in which formula_8. However, per König's theorem, it is not consistent to assume formula_9 is formula_10 or formula_11 or any cardinal with cofinality formula_12.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis is closely related to many statements in analysis, point set topology and measure theory. As a result of its independence, many substantial conjectures in those fields have subsequently been shown to be independent as well.\n\nThe independence from ZFC means that proving or disproving the CH within ZFC is impossible. However, Gödel and Cohen's negative results are not universally accepted as disposing of all interest in the continuum hypothesis. Hilbert's problem remains an active topic of research; see and for an overview of the current research status.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis was not the first statement shown to be independent of ZFC. An immediate consequence of Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which was published in 1931, is that there is a formal statement (one for each appropriate Gödel numbering scheme) expressing the consistency of ZFC that is independent of ZFC, assuming that ZFC is consistent. The continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice were among the first mathematical statements shown to be independent of ZF set theory.\n\nGödel believed that CH is false, and that his proof that CH is consistent with ZFC only shows that the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms do not adequately characterize the universe of sets. Gödel was a platonist and therefore had no problems with asserting the truth and falsehood of statements independent of their provability. Cohen, though a formalist , also tended towards rejecting CH.\n\nHistorically, mathematicians who favored a \"rich\" and \"large\" universe of sets were against CH, while those favoring a \"neat\" and \"controllable\" universe favored CH. Parallel arguments were made for and against the axiom of constructibility, which implies CH. More recently, Matthew Foreman has pointed out that ontological maximalism can actually be used to argue in favor of CH, because among models that have the same reals, models with \"more\" sets of reals have a better chance of satisfying CH (Maddy 1988, p. 500).\n\nAnother viewpoint is that the conception of set is not specific enough to determine whether CH is true or false. This viewpoint was advanced as early as 1923 by Skolem, even before Gödel's first incompleteness theorem. Skolem argued on the basis of what is now known as Skolem's paradox, and it was later supported by the independence of CH from the axioms of ZFC since these axioms are enough to establish the elementary properties of sets and cardinalities. In order to argue against this viewpoint, it would be sufficient to demonstrate new axioms that are supported by intuition and resolve CH in one direction or another. Although the axiom of constructibility does resolve CH, it is not generally considered to be intuitively true any more than CH is generally considered to be false (Kunen 1980, p. 171).\n\nAt least two other axioms have been proposed that have implications for the continuum hypothesis, although these axioms have not currently found wide acceptance in the mathematical community. In 1986, Chris Freiling presented an argument against CH by showing that the negation of CH is equivalent to Freiling's axiom of symmetry, a statement about probabilities. Freiling believes this axiom is \"intuitively true\" but others have disagreed. A difficult argument against CH developed by W. Hugh Woodin has attracted considerable attention since the year 2000 (Woodin 2001a, 2001b). Foreman (2003) does not reject Woodin's argument outright but urges caution.\n\nSolomon Feferman (2011) has made a complex philosophical argument that CH is not a definite mathematical problem. He proposes a theory of \"definiteness\" using a semi-intuitionistic subsystem of ZF that accepts classical logic for bounded quantifiers but uses intuitionistic logic for unbounded ones, and suggests that a proposition formula_13 is mathematically \"definite\" if the semi-intuitionistic theory can prove formula_14. He conjectures that CH is not definite according to this notion, and proposes that CH should, therefore, be considered not to have a truth value. Peter Koellner (2011b) wrote a critical commentary on Feferman's article.\n\nJoel David Hamkins proposes a multiverse approach to set theory and argues that \"the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and, as a result, it can no longer be settled in the manner formerly hoped for.\" (Hamkins 2012). In a related vein, Saharon Shelah wrote that he does \"not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that we just have to discover the additional axiom. My mental picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC.\" (Shelah 2003).\n\nThe \"generalized continuum hypothesis\" (GCH) states that if an infinite set's cardinality lies between that of an infinite set \"S\" and that of the power set of \"S\", then it either has the same cardinality as the set \"S\" or the same cardinality as the power set of \"S\". That is, for any infinite cardinal formula_15 there is no cardinal formula_7 such that formula_17 GCH is equivalent to:\nThe beth numbers provide an alternate notation for this condition: formula_20 for every ordinal formula_19\n\nThis is a generalization of the continuum hypothesis since the continuum has the same cardinality as the power set of the integers. It was first suggested by . (For the early history of GCH, see ).\n\nLike CH, GCH is also independent of ZFC, but Sierpiński proved that ZF + GCH implies the axiom of choice (AC) (and therefore the negation of the axiom of determinacy, AD), so choice and GCH are not independent in ZF; there are no models of ZF in which GCH holds and AC fails. To prove this, Sierpiński showed GCH implies that every cardinality n is smaller than some Aleph number, and thus can be ordered. This is done by showing that n is smaller than formula_22 which is smaller than its own Hartogs number—this uses the equality formula_23; for the full proof, see Gillman (2002).\n\nKurt Gödel showed that GCH is a consequence of ZF + V=L (the axiom that every set is constructible relative to the ordinals), and is therefore consistent with ZFC. As GCH implies CH, Cohen's model in which CH fails is a model in which GCH fails, and thus GCH is not provable from ZFC. W. B. Easton used the method of forcing developed by Cohen to prove Easton's theorem, which shows it is consistent with ZFC for arbitrarily large cardinals formula_24 to fail to satisfy formula_25 Much later, Foreman and Woodin proved that (assuming the consistency of very large cardinals) it is consistent that formula_26 holds for every infinite cardinal formula_27 Later Woodin extended this by showing the consistency of formula_28 for every formula_7. showed that, for each \"n\" ≥ 1, it is consistent with ZFC that for each κ, 2 is the \"n\"th successor of κ. On the other hand, proved, that if γ is an ordinal and for each infinite cardinal κ, 2 is the γth successor of κ, then γ is finite.\n\nFor any infinite sets A and B, if there is an injection from A to B then there is an injection from subsets of A to subsets of B. Thus for any infinite cardinals A and B, formula_30 . If A and B are finite, the stronger inequality formula_31 holds. GCH implies that this strict, stronger inequality holds for infinite cardinals as well as finite cardinals.\n\nAlthough the generalized continuum hypothesis refers directly only to cardinal exponentiation with 2 as the base, one can deduce from it the values of cardinal exponentiation formula_32 in all cases. GCH implies that (see: Hayden & Kennison (1968), page 147, exercise 76):\n\n\n\n"}

After a period of debate, a vote is taken. If one vote clearly wins (gaining 60% or above share if two options for example) all participants (the party) are expected to follow that decision, and not continue propagandising or otherwise working against it, aiming to act in unity. If participants still disagree, instead of splitting and forming another party as in Representative Democracy they are expected to table a motion for discussing the issue again. In the development of socialism in Russia and China, it was largely taken up in response to dramatic developments and violence which required faster mechanisms of making decisions. A constellation of practices surround this in order to encourage participation and debate, such as Don't Blame the Speaker. \n\nThe text \"What Is to Be Done?\" from 1902 is popularly seen as the founding text of democratic centralism. At this time, democratic centralism was generally viewed as a set of principles for the organizing of a revolutionary workers' party. However, Vladimir Lenin's model for such a party, which he repeatedly discussed as being \"democratic centralist\", was the German Social Democratic Party, inspired by remarks made by the social democrat Jean Baptista von Schweitzer. Lenin described democratic centralism as consisting of \"freedom of discussion, unity of action\".\n\nThe doctrine of democratic centralism served as one of the sources of the split between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The Mensheviks supported a looser party discipline within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1903 as did Leon Trotsky, in \"Our Political Tasks\", although Trotsky joined ranks with the Bolsheviks in 1917.\n\nThe Sixth Party Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) held at Petrograd between 26 July and 3 August 1917 defined democratic centralism as follows:\n\nAfter the successful consolidation of power by the Communist Party following the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War, the Bolshevik leadership, including Lenin, instituted a ban on factions in the party as Resolution No. 12 of the 10th Party Congress in 1921. It was passed in the morning session on 16 March 1921. Supporters of Trotsky sometimes claim that this ban was intended to be temporary, but there is no language in the discussion at the 10th Party Congress suggesting such.\n\nThe Group of Democratic Centralism was a group in the Soviet Communist Party who advocated different concepts of party democracy.\n\nIn \"On Party Unity\", Lenin argued that democratic centralism prevents factionalism. He argued that factionalism leads to less friendly relations among members and that it can be exploited by enemies of the party.\n\nBy the Brezhnev period, democratic centralism was described in the 1977 Soviet Constitution as a principle for organizing the state: \"The Soviet state is organized and functions on the principle of democratic centralism, namely the electiveness of all bodies of state authority from the lowest to the highest, their accountability to the people, and the obligation of lower bodies to observe the decisions of higher ones\". Democratic centralism combines central leadership with local initiative and creative activity and with the responsibility of each state body and official for the work entrusted to them.\n\nThe democratic centralist principle extended to elections in the Soviet Union. All Communist countries were—either \"de jure\" or \"de facto\"—one-party states. In most cases, the voters were presented with a single list of unopposed candidates, which usually won 90 percent or more of the vote. In some countries, those who voted against the lone candidate on the ballot could face serious reprisals.\n\nDemocratic centralism is also stated in Article 3 of the present Constitution of the People's Republic of China: Article 3. The state organs of the People's Republic of China apply the principle of democratic centralism\".\" The National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at different levels are instituted through democratic election. They are responsible to the people and subject to their supervision. All administrative, judicial and procuratorial organs of the state are created by the people's congresses to which they are responsible and under whose supervision they operate. The division of functions and powers between the central and local state organs is guided by the principle of giving full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the local authorities under the unified leadership of the central authorities.\n\nThis idea is translated into the supremacy of the National People's Congress, which represents China's citizens and exercises legislative authority on their behalf. Other powers, including the power to appoint the head of state and head of government, are also vested in this body.\n\n"}

Most field schools are four to eight weeks in length. They are directed by academic faculty and students are awarded academic credit units and letter grade for their participation. Programs are typically intensive and students and faculty work many hours each day together. They frequently involve learning through conducting primary research in the field. \nFaculty to student ratio in field schools is usually kept very low. They rarely exceed 1:20 and in many programs they are kept at 1:6. The result is the creation of a genuine team learning experience and authentic mentoring of students. Field schools are experiential programs where students learn primarily by doing. Lectures, especially during the evenings, are mainstay for many field schools.\n\nSome disciplines require field school participation as a condition for graduating with a BA or BS degree. Archaeology, Geology and Paleontology are typically such disciplines although specific requirements differ from one university to the next. Graduate students, especially those early in their graduate academic careers, may participate in field schools. High school students or individuals associated with universities rarely attend as these are seen as highly academic training programs.\n\nData about field school attendance is not easily available (Boytner 2012; Mytum 2011). The Institute for International Education – the organization that collects data about US students studying abroad through its annual Open Doors Report – does not designate students participating in field schools, or even research-based programs, as a category in its analysis. It is unknown how many students participate in field school activities annually, whether within or outside the US.\n\nMany field schools are run through universities, training their own students. In recent years, field schools are emerging as significant revenue generating programs and universities are trying to attract students outside of those matriculating in their institution and charge hefty fees. The economic crisis of 2008 resulted with the removal of institutional subsidies for many field schools in the US and many field schools are now charging the full costs of the program. Universities rarely monitor the quality of the field schools they offer as these are off campus, typically small in scale and effective monitoring requires significant investment of resources. The result is that university based field schools are effectively unmonitored with significant gaps in quality.\n\nIn recent decades, independent and highly specialized academic organizations that run field schools independent of universities emerged. Such organizations are dedicated operators of research-based field schools and use economies of scale to produce quality programs. Students from any university may apply to such programs. The School for Field Studies in ecology, Sea Semester in marine biology and the Institute for Field Research in archaeology are examples of such high end organizations.\n\nDisciplines that typically require, or strongly encourage students to participate in a field school as part of the requirement for graduation includes:\n\n\nIn the US, an increasing number of students prefer to attend field schools abroad. Combining travel, research and intensive learning environments is appealing to students who seek to maximize the use of their time and resources. However, large number of students within the US and most students in countries elsewhere in the world attend field schools in relative proximity to their home campuses.\n\nAs universities offer increasing number of online classes and as the Massive open online course (MOOC’s) are becoming progressively popular, the need for an intensive, time-condensed yet quality field training programs surge. Universities are moving to outsource such activities as they wish to minimized investment and exposure and are turning to organizations that can both guarantee quality of education and assume liability exposure.\n"}

Linguists, social psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists are among the social scientists who have studied and identified patterns of interruption that may differ by gender, social status, race/ethnicity, culture, and political orientation.\n\nHarvey Sacks, the sociologist who launched the field of conversation analysis, worked with linguist Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson in the 1970s to analyze how turn-taking was organized in speech events such as everyday conversations. Speech events are organized so that only one person speaks at a time and to provide for orderly ways to change speakers. Sacks et al. thought that the process of turn-taking is subconscious.\n\nOverlaps occur when two or more speakers talk simultaneously.\n\nCommunication analyst Julia A. Goldberg uses conversation analysis to define three types of conversational interruptions. Relationally neutral interruptions are interjections by the listener that seek to repair, repeat, or clarify something the speaker just said. During this type of interruption, the interrupter does not intend to exert power over the speaker, or to establish rapport with the speaker. The act of interruption itself is understood as neutral in this instance. Another type of interruption defined by Goldberg is the power interruption, where the interrupter breaks in and cuts off the speaker as a way to display some social power. Power interruptions are understood as acts of conflict and competition, and are viewed as rude, hostile, disrespectful, and/or uncaring about the speaker and/or what the speaker is saying. A rapport interruption is designed to display mutuality and generally conveys the impression that the interrupter understands and empathizes with the speaker and/or the content of the speech, and is interpreted as collaborative and cooperative.\n\nPower interruptions are also analyzed by Zimmerman and West, sociologists who note that the people who seek to be socially dominant exert their power over others through interrupting their speech. This can be seen in interactions between whites and racial/ethnic minorities, and between adults and children. Zimmerman and West also analyzed how sex roles shape interruption patterns.\n\nSince the late-1970s, social scientists have studied the effect gender has on interruption patterns and other components of verbal communication. The findings of these studies are mixed, with some finding gender differences, while others did not. Among those that found gender differences are sociologists Don Zimmerman and Candace West who used male dominance theory to claim that men interrupted women to assert their social dominance over females. Zimmerman and West's work discovered that interruptions were more evenly distributed in conversations involving same-sex speakers, while in cross-sex interactions, men were much more likely to interrupt women. Zhao and Gantz analyzed fictional TV shows to claim that male characters used disruptive interruptions more than female characters, while female characters more often used cooperative interruptions. They note, however, that the apparent gender differences in interruption patterns are affected by differences in social status among the TV characters. Goldberg notes that when conversational context and content are analyzed, interruptions may be seen as power displays, rapport displays, or as neutral acts that may or may not be shaped by the gender of the speaker. Linguist Makri-Tsilipakou discovered that men and women use \"simultaneous speech\" at about the same rate, but the sexes differ as to their interpretation of the meaning of the interruption. Women use simultaneous speech as a sign of support and agreement, while men use it either as support for the other's speech or to dissent from other speakers or from their viewpoint. Drass, a social psychologist, found that gender identity, as separate from biological sex, was an important variable, with persons who were more male-identified being more likely to interrupt than persons who were more female-identified.\n\nConversely, a study by Murray and Covelli used Zimmerman and West's coding strategies on their own dataset of conversations to find that women interrupted men more often than men interrupted women. According to James and Clarke, this pattern is especially evident in conversational situations where women felt more expertise, and thus may have felt that their interruptions were more legitimate.\n\nThe term, , was coined in early 2015 by Jessica Bennett in an article that appeared in \"Time.\" Bennett defines the term as \"[u]nnecessary interruption of a woman by a man.\" During the 2016 American presidential debates, the term was applied to candidate Donald Trump who interrupted Hillary Clinton dozens of times during the first and second debates. Since its introduction, the term has gained a significant presence on the internet as experts offer advice on how to avoid manterrupting and as feminist and postfeminist bloggers and commentators debate its applicability. In 2017, Woman Interrupted, an app to track the gender of conversational partners was introduced. The app, which is free, is designed to assist men and women in recognizing and addressing manterrupting.\n\nInterruptions work as a status-organizing cue. In other words, conversational participants use cues such as perceptions of prestige, power, social class, gender, race and age, to organize small group hierarchies. Interruption patterns differ by social status, with persons of higher social status, such as belonging to a social group who has more prestige or power, interrupting persons with lower status. Jacobi and Schweers analyzed transcripts of oral arguments made before the U.S. Supreme Court to find that senior justices interrupted their junior colleagues more frequently than the reverse. Kollock et al. studied conversations among couples, including male couples, female couples, and mixed sex couples. They found that partners who were considered to have more social power interrupted their partners more often, regardless of the gender composition of the dyad. In TV shows, characters who are lower in the status hierarchy are scripted to display a \"sense of defiance\" that allows them to interrupt more aggressively than persons who hold a mid-level status. A study of interviews between physicians and patients found that physicians, who are considered to hold higher status than their patients in terms of prestige, are much more likely to interrupt their patients, regardless of the sex of the patient or the physician. Patients interrupted senior physicians at a higher rate than they interrupted doctors who were in training, indicating that the senior physicians are regarded as having a higher status than the their junior colleagues. In contrast, a study of physician-patient interactions among six different statuses, from low to high, indicated that patients tended to interrupt physicians more than the reverse, and that high and low status physicians did not differ in the number of times that they interrupted their patients. This study, by Irish and Hall, noted that status thus appears to be less of an indicator of the likelihood of interruptions among physicians and patients.\n\nIn addition to social status affecting interruption patterns, interruptions also affect social status. In a study of mixed-sex and same-sex dyads, Farley discovered that the interrupters gained social status after they interrupted, while those who were interrupted lost social status. This study also found that people who interrupted also lost in terms of likeability.\n\nZimmerman and West note that whites interrupt blacks as a strategy to exert their power and dominance.\n\nInterruptions, and how people interpret interruptions, differ by culture and language. Makri-Tsilpakou notes that some languages and cultures have higher tolerance for simultaneous talk, and that interpretations of interruptions may differ depending on cultural context.\n\nPolitical orientation, e.g. where a person falls on the conservative to liberal political continuum, also shapes the likelihood that people will interrupt others or will be interrupted themselves. Jacobi and Schweers, in their study of transcripts of oral arguments made before the U.S. Supreme Court, found that conservative justices and advocates interrupt more often than liberals.\n"}

The SIL Ethnologue lists 415 living languages for India.\n\nIndia has 23 constitutionally recognized official languages. Hindi and English are typically used as an official language by the Central Government. State governments use respective official languages.\n\nHindi is the most widely spoken language in northern parts of India. The Indian census takes the widest possible definition of \"Hindi\" as a broad variety of \"Hindi languages\". According to 2001 Census, 53.6% of the Indian population declared that they speak Hindi as either their first or second language, in which 41% of them have declared it as their native language or mother tongue. 12% of Indians declared that they can speak English as a second language.\n\nThirteen languages account for more than 1% of Indian population each, and between themselves for over 95%; all of them are \"scheduled languages of the constitution\". Scheduled languages spoken by fewer than 1% of Indians are Santali (0.63%), Kashmiri (0.54%), Nepali (0.28%), Sindhi (0.25%), Konkani (0.24%), Dogri (0.22%), Meitei (0.14%), Bodo (0.13%) and Sanskrit (In the 2001 census of India, only 14,135 people reported Sanskrit as their native language).

He is considered to be the founder of modern Gujarati literature. After studying in Bombay, he stopped serving as a teacher to live by writing. During his prolific career, he introduced many literary forms in Gujarati. He faced economic struggles but proved himself as a dedicated reformer, speaking loudly against religious and social orthodoxy. His essays, poems, plays and prose were published in several collections. His \"Mari Hakikat\", the first autobiography in Gujarati, was published posthumously. His poem \"Jai Jai Garavi Gujarat\" is now \"de facto\" state anthem of Gujarat state of India.\n\nNarmad was born in Surat, Gujarat on 24 August 1833 to Lalshankar and Navdurga. His family home in Amliran, Surat was destroyed in the great fire of 25 April 1837 but was later rebuilt. He commenced schooling with Nana Mehta in Bhuleshwar, Bombay at age five. He later joined Fakir Mehta and Ichchha Mehta's school in Surat and moved to Bombay where he attended the Government Gujarati school of Balgovind Mehta at Pydhonie. He returned to Surat where he attended the school of Durgaram Mehta and Pranshankar Mehta. He was initiated in Upanayan at age eight. He started studying at the English School, Elphinstone Institute, Bombay on 6 January 1845, beginning college in June 1850. He delivered his first public speech \"Mandali Malvathi Thata Labh\" (The Advantages of Forming An Associations) that same year. His mother died on 23 November 1850 and he left college.\n\nHe was appointed as a teacher at the school of Rander on 1 May 1851. He again recited his early essay in \"Swadesh Hitechchhu Mandali\" and started \"Gyansagar\" magazine in July 1851. He was transferred to a school in Nanpara in March 1853. After the death of his wife Gulab, he left this position and went to Bombay, in January 1854. He returned to college on the suggestion of his friend Jhaverilal Umiyashankar and joined Buddhivardhak Sabha, a literary group in June 1854. He started learning \"Siddhant Kaumudi\". \n\nHe became interested in poetry and started writing in September 1855, studying literary metre over the following year. He presided over \"Buddhivardhak Granth\" from March to December 1856. After his second marriage, he left college in August 1856, writing \"Pingal Pravesh\" in February 1857 and dedicating it to his father. He joined Gokuldas Tejpal Vidyalaya as a teacher and began studying Sanskrit literary works such as \"Laghu kaumudi\", \"Chandralok\", \"Nrisimhachampu\", \"Kavyachampu\", \"Prataprudra\", \"Adhyatma Ramayana\". He started at Central School as a teacher in February 1858, then resigned in November 1858 after deciding to pursue a literary career.\n\nHe studied Sanskrit grammar and poetry in Pune from November 1858 to March 1859. Deciding to study independently he returned to Bombay in March, where he met Dalpatram, a reformist Gujarati poet, in June 1859, and became involved in reform activities.\n\nHis wife Dahigauri returned to her parents' home. In 1860, he had discussed widow remarriage with religious leader Jadunathji Maharaj, which led to him becoming involved with the \"Maharaj Libel Case\" the next year. The case was filed by Jadunathji against writer Karsandas Mulji after the journalist published an article alleging sexual exploitation of women in his religious sect. \n\nHe visited Income Tax Commissioner Curtis regarding a surcharge on 3 February 1863. With the help of friends, he started a biweekly newsletter called \"Dandiyo\" ( A drum stick), modeled after British weekly \"The Spectator,\" in September 1864. It was loudly reformist in its stand and attacked traditional customs of Hindu society. It ran until 1869 when it was merged with \"The Sunday Review\". On 18 January 1864, his father died, aged 56. He moved back to Surat in July 1865 and sheltered Savitagauri, a widow, in a neighbouring house. He published \"Narmagadya\" in September 1865. He was banished from his caste due to reform activities on 18 August but reinstated on 21 November 1866. The same year, he wrote his autobiographical work, \"Mari Hakikat\", the first autobiography in Gujarati. He published \"Nayikavishaypravesh\" and \"Uttam Nayika\" dedicated to his then separated wife, Dahigauri. In early 1867, he published \"Narmakavita\", a poetry collection. He had debts of 10,000 that caused him great concern. He married again in 1869. He published summaries of \"Ramayana\", \"Mahabharata\" and \"Iliad\" in 1870. He published the school version of \"Narmagadya\" in 1874 and the edition for the government in 1875.\n\nHe moved back again to Bombay in March 1875, where he met Dayanand Saraswati, a reformist and founder of Arya Samaj, and started to become deeply religious. He published the first dictionary of Gujarati language in March 1876. He founded Vedsarasvati in \"Sarasvatimandir\" of Surat on 16 April 1877.\n\nAryanitidarshak Mandali performed his play \"Draupadi-Darshan\" in 1878. By 1880 he had become fully \"believer\" and performed Upanayana for his son that year. He wrote a play, \"Shri Sarshakuntal\" in 1881 which was performed. He published a translation of \"Bhagvad Gita\" in 1882. Although unhappy about breaking a resolve not to work for other people, he was forced due to financial difficulties into taking a position as a secretary to Gokuldas Tejpal Dharmakhata. He wrote a play, \"Shri Balkrishnavijay\" in 1883. \n\nHis health failing due to the stress of work starting a hostel, he left his job on 19 July 1885. After a prolonged eight month illness, he died of arthritis on 26 February 1886 in Bombay.\n\nNarmad is considered to be the founder of modern Gujarati literature. He introduced many creative forms of writing to the Gujarati language, including pioneering works in autobiography, poetry, lexicography, historical plays and folk literature research. He was an outspoken journalist and pamphleteer. Narmad was a strong opponent of religious fanaticism and orthodoxy. He promoted nationalism and patriotism with famous songs such as \"Sahu Chalo Jeetva Jang,\" wrote about self-government and discussed having one national language, Hindustani, for all of India, nearly five decades before Mahatma Gandhi or Nehru. His poem \"Jai Jai Garavi Gujarat\", written in the preface of \"Narmakosh\", listed with a sense of pride all the cultural symbols that go into constituting the Gujarati identity. These symbols included things non-Hindu, implying that Gujarat belongs to all the castes, communities, races, religions and sects that live together there. The poem is now \"de facto\" state song of Gujarat. Mahatma Gandhi acknowledged him for his philosophy of nonviolence.\n\nHis major collected works are \"Narmagadya\" (), collection of prose; \"Narmakavita\" (), collection of poems; \"Narmakathakosh\" (), collection of stories of characters of mythological literature and \"Narmakosh\" (), dictionary. His \"Mari Hakikat\", the first autobiography in Gujarati, was published posthumously.\n\nHis volumes of \"Narmakavita:1-3\" (1858), \"Narmakavita:4-8\" (1859) and \"Narmakavita:9-10\" (1860) were collected into \"Narmakavita:Book 1\" (1862). Later \"Narmakavita:Book 2\" (1863) was published. All his poetry was later collected together in \"Narmakavita\" (1864).\n\nHis poem, \"Jai Jai Garavi Gujarat\" (1873), is used as a de facto state song for Gujarat.\n\nHis \"Rasapravesh\" (1858), \"Pingalpravesh\" (1857), \"Alankarpravesh\" (1858), \"Narmavyakaran\" Part I and II (1865), \"Varnavichar\" (1865), \"Nayika Vishaypravesh\" (1866) are his collections of essays on poetics with historical importance.\n\n\"Rituvarnan\" (1861), \"Hinduoni Padati\" (1864), \"Kavicharit\" (1865), \"Suratni Mukhtesar Hakikat\" (1865), \"Iliadno Sar\" (1870), \"Mahipatram Rupram Mehta\" (1870), \"Mahapurushona Charitra\" (1870), \"Mahabharatano Sar\" (1870), \"Ramayanano Sar\" (1870), \"Sarshakuntal\" (1881), \"Bhagvadgitanu Bhashantar\" (1882) are his prose works. His other writings between 1850 and 1865 collected in \"Narmagadya\" (1865) and posthumously published \"Narmagadya-2\" (1936) are his other prose works.\n\nHis essays are collected and edited in three volumes. They are \"Narmadgadya\" or \"Narmadashankar Lalashankarna Gadyatmak Granthono Sangrah\" (1875) edited by Mahipatram Rupram Nilkanth, \"Narmadnu Mandir\"-Gadya Vibhag (1937) edited by Vishwanath Bhatt and \"Narmadgadya\"(1975) edited by Gambhirsinh Gohil. His fifteen prose works were collected in \"Junu Narmadgadya\" Part I, II (1865, 1874)and are also important.\n\nHe had researched and edited several works. Manohar Swami's \"Manhar Pad\" (1860), \"Narmakosh\": Issue 1 (1861), \"Narmakosh\": Issue 2 (1862), \"Narmakosh\":Issue 3 (1864), \"Narmakosh\":Issue 4 (1865). \"Narmakathakosh\" (1870), \"Dayaramkrut Kavyasangrah\" (1865), \"Stree Geet Sangrah\" (1870) of songs popular in Nagar Brahmin ladies, Premanand's \"Dashamskandh\" (1872) and the complete issue of \"Narmakosh\" (1873) are his edited and researched works.\n\n\"Tusli Vaidhvyachitra\" (dialogue, 1859), \"Ramjanaki Darshan\" (1876), \"Draupadidarshan\" (1878), \"Balkrishnavijay\" (1886), \"Krishnakumari\" are plays and dialogues. His \"Seetaharan\" (1878) was a previously unpublished play. \"Rajyarang\" Part I, II (1874, 1876) are his works on ancient and modern world history. \"Dharmavichar\" is his work on philosophy. \"Gujarat Sarvasangrah\" (1887) and \"Kathiawar Sarvasangrah\" (1887) are also historical works.\n\n\"Mari Hakikat\", his autobiography written in 1866 and published posthumously in 1933, is the first autobiography written in Gujarati. His notes and letters were later published as \"Uttar Narmad Charitra\" (1939).\n\n\"Narmad:Mari Hakikat\" or \"Narmad:My Life\", a critically acclaimed soliloquy based on his writings and life, was written and directed by Harish Trivedi and performed by Chandrakant Shah. It premiered in Dayton, Ohio, US in 1995 and later toured India, the UK and France. Chandravadan Mehta wrote a play based on his life.\n\nNarmad's house, Saraswati Mandir, has been restored and converted into museum. Several places in Gujarat were named after him, such as Central Library in Surat. Busts of him have been erected in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat. In 2004, South Gujarat University was renamed \"Veer Narmad South Gujarat University\" in his memory. A replica of his house is also constructed in the university campus. The literary honour Narmad Suvarna Chandrak has been yearly awarded by Narmad Sahitya Sabha, Surat since 1940. A special cover was released by \"India Post\" on his 175th birth anniversary in 2008.\n\nHe married Gulab, daughter of Surajram Shastri of Sudder Court, Surat, on 29 April 1844. She gave a birth to girl in 1852 who died 15 days later. Gulab herself died on 5 October 1853 following a stillbirth. In May 1856, he married Dahigauri, daughter of Tripuranand Shastri; she separated from him in 1860. He married Subhadra (later Narmadagauri), a widow of his caste, in 1869, breaking the customary taboo against widow remarriage. She gave birth to their son Jayshankar in 1870. He worked as a clerk for Bombay Municipality, and never married, dying on 31 March 1910 of the plague.\n\nJust at the time when Narmad was emerging into celebrity (1859), Dalpatram who had already won his laurels, happened to visit Bombay for treatment of his eyes. Lovers of Gujarati poetry, they met together, and in the poetical contest that took place, naturally they warmed up and their audience took sides as to who was the better poet. The result was a lifelong estrangement between the two. The contest was continued in the public papers and a humorous paper. The \"Parsi Punch\", a weekly, published a cartoon, in which they were represented as fighting each other with the top-knot of the hair of their heads in their hands.\n\n\n"}

He asked what language was being used. He was jokingly told that the post was in Albanian. He questioned why people were posting messages in Albanian by saying:\n\nBecause? It's LIVEJOURNAL. An American website. Not an albanian; (#*!@()! site.\n\nPlus, being an American means that the rest of the world should have to cater to me. But that's just mypointofview.\n\nIn reaction to this comment, an Internet meme started, urging the English language user to \"Learn Albanian!\" and flooding him with email messages, text messages, and calls to his personal cell phone. Eventually, the English language user wrote an apology in Russian, explaining that he had mastered the Albanian language.\n\nSince then, the request to \"Learn Olbanian!\" became a friendly response to anyone using incorrect grammar or when saying something that doesn't make sense.\n\nAn invitation to \"Learn Olbanian!\" was directed at Madonna in 2006, when in her blog she used an electronic translator to address her Russian fans and called them \"Russian ventilators\" by mistake.\n\nThe language was first developed in 1997 by intellectuals with Internet access who were developing and using open-source software LiveJournal and Russian FidoNet. They were journalists, system administrators and professionals with academic degrees.\n\nThe language is based on sensational (mostly phonetic, but also counterphonetic) spelling of the Russian and Ukrainian languages often using profanity. It combines complex orthography with creative use of idioms and literary expression. It is often used to express disagreement, amusement, or to create political satire. It was popularized by the padonki subculture on websites like Udaff.com and Fuck.ru (currently defunct) created by entrepreneur Egor Lavrov and Konstantin Rykov, now a deputy of the Duma.\n\nPadonkaffsky jargon is difficult to translate with a traditional dictionary because many of the misspellings also involve puns and cultural slang. Padonkaffsky language has gone mainstream and is common in Russian vernacular and popular culture. As a result, the websites on which Padonkaffsky language originally appeared are now dominated by another kind of high-shock-value material, adult content.\n\nThe unstressed letter is replaced by , and sometimes the other way around. The unstressed letters , , and are also interchangeable. The consonant may become or , the suffix becomes , becomes , becomes , etc. Examples: превед (PREVED, from привет \"privet\" 'hi!'), аффтар \"afftar\" (from автор \"avtor\" 'author'), йад (from яд \"yad\" 'poison'), etc.\n\n"}

It means 'a commander of a body of troops'. In the past it is used to call some prominent military leaders in several kingdoms, such as Panglima Polem from Aceh. In modern times it is reserved for the chiefs of the armed forces of Indonesia and Malaysia and some other posts.\n\nPer Indonesian Constitution the President of Indonesia is the Supreme Commander of Indonesian Armed Forces (Panglima Tertinggi Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia). Essentially it is parallel to the title 'Commander-in-Chief' in other countries, \"e.g.\" the United States.\n\nDuring the Old Order era, this title is included into many honorific titles that were often mentioned each time Sukarno's name was written or read in speeches, edicts, or news.\n\nIn Indonesian National Armed Forces the highest position overseeing the three branches - Army, Navy, Air Force - is called Panglima Tentara National Indonesia ('Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces'). Before the separation of the National Police from the Armed forces in 2000, the Armed Forces consisted of four branches. The Armed Forces were named Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia, which comprised TNI and the Police. The commander of the Armed Forces was called \"Panglima ABRI\" accordingly, or usually known with the acronym Pangab.\n\nAccording to the revised Constitution \"Panglima TNI\" is appointed by the President after confirmed by DPR. Before the Constitution was amended in 2002, the President had the prerogative right to appoint or dismiss the 'Panglima' at his pleasure.\n\nThe honorific title Panglima Besar, meaning 'Grand Commander' was bestowed informally upon Sudirman, the first Commander of the Armed Forces and legendary leader of guerilla war during Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949).\n\nBeside the use for 'Panglima TNI', the title 'Panglima' is also used for many formations within the Armed Forces.\n\nThe commander of Kostrad, a formation within the Indonesian Army, is called 'Panglima Kostrad'. One of such notable Panglima Kostrad is the first, Suharto, who later became a President of Indonesia (1968–1998), and the second, Umar Wirahadikusumah, who became Vice President of Indonesia (1983–1988).\n\nEach commander of Military Territorial Commands (\"Komando Daerah Militer\", usually known with the acronym \"Kodam\") has the title 'Panglima Daerah Militer' or Pangdam. There are 17 Kodam, each with one Pangdam.\n\nEach commander of the three Fleet Commands is given title 'Panglima'. The commander of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Fleet Command (\"Komando Armada I/II/III\"), are known as Panglima Armada I/II/III or Pangarmada I/II/III. \n\nSimilar to the Navy, each commander of the three Air Force Operations Commands is also given title 'Panglima'. The commander of Air Force Operations Command - 1/2/3 (\"Komando Operasi TNI Angkatan Udara I/II/II or Koopsau I/II/III\"), are known as Panglima Koopsau I/II/III. \n\nThe Highest position in Military Sea-lift Command (\"Komando Lintas Laut Militer\" /\"Kolinlamil\") are given the title of 'Panglima', which is Panglima Kolinlamil.\n\nNational Air Defence Forces Command (\"Komando Pertahanan Udara Nasional\" /\"Kohanudnas\") also use the title of 'Panglima' for its highest position, which is Panglima Kohanudnas and for its each Commander of Air Defense Sector (Panglima Komando Sektor Pertahanan Udara Nasional or Pangkosek Hanudnas).\n\nUpon the formation of the Fourth Working Cabinet (19 November 1963), the title 'Panglima' was used for the commander of each branch of Indonesian Armed Forces. They were also members of the Cabinet. Therefore, they were given the title Menteri (Minister), appointed directly by the President. As such, their titles were: \nThis use was discontinued in the New Order era, replaced with the title Kepala Staf (Chief of Staff) for the commander of three branches and Kepala (Chief) for the Chief of National Police.\n\nIn Malaysian Armed Forces (Angkatan Tentera Malaysia) the highest position overseeing the branches - Army, Navy, Air Force - is called Panglima Angkatan Tentera Malaysia (in official English translation: Chief of Defence Force).\n\nEach branch of Malaysian Armed Forces has a \"Panglima\" at its head. Chief of Army is Panglima Tentera Darat, Chief of Navy is Panglima Tentera Laut, and Chief of Air Force is Panglima Tentera Udara. Each of them also has a deputy commander, called Timbalan Panglima (Deputy Chief).\n\nThe word 'Panglima' is used for several titles in the orders and decorations of Malaysia, such as \"Panglima Mangku Negara\" (P.M.N), \"Panglima Setia Mahkota\" (P.S.M.), \"Panglima Jasa Negara\" (P.J.N.), and \"Panglima Setia Diraja\" (P.S.D.).\n\n\n\n"}

Funds from the ticket and concession sales for the game typically go to charity, the senior class, or to a dance. The games are an annual tradition at many high schools and universities.\n\nThe term originates from the powder puff, the soft material used for the application of cosmetic face powder. The games usually occur before homecoming.\n\nMany schools that participate in powderpuff games have created their own traditions. Some examples of traditions that make the event more entertaining for students are the creation of team uniform T-shirts for each of the classes, pre-game pep talks to get everyone \"pumped\", and special half-time performances from the class's male members, sometimes with them dressing up in female clothing.\n\nIt is not clear when the first powderpuff football game was played, although there is photographic evidence of it being played as early as 1931 at Western State College of Colorado (now Western State Colorado University) in Gunnison, Colorado.\n\nOne of the first well-documented powderpuff football games was played on October 20, 1945, at Eastern State Teachers College, in Madison, South Dakota. Eastern had cancelled many campus activities for the duration of World War II. Among these were the annual homecoming celebration and intercollegiate sports, including football With the signing of the peace treaty with Japan on September 2, 1945, and the war’s official end, Homecoming was again on the schedule at Eastern. The traditional football game seemed out of the question, however, due to the wartime military draft. Just three men had enrolled for the fall term that year.\n\n\"A bunch of us were sitting around after gym class and we thought, if we’re going to have Homecoming, we've got to have a football game,\" said Susie Lowry, who was a freshman at Eastern in 1945. \"We decided we should have a game of our own.\"\n\nRobert C. Nelles, a freshman at Eastern that year, was on the Homecoming committee. The very idea of women playing football \"was enough to curl your teeth\", he wrote in an account of the game for the \"History of Lake County\", but the committee nonetheless gave its approval for a game with all women players.\n\nThere were two groups of Eastern coeds at the time: those who lived at their homes in Madison while attending classes on campus, and those from surrounding small towns who lived in the dorm. The 23 girls who wanted to play football divided into two teams, informally known as the Townies and Dormies. On game day, the teams were designated Blue and Gold teams, respectively, which were Eastern’s school colors.\n\nLeota Van Ornum, Eastern's physical education teacher, served as coach for both teams. There was a high school on Eastern’s campus where students training to be teachers did their practice teaching. Robert Ormseth, who coached that school's football team, served as her assistant.\n\n\"A fairly large group of spectators showed great interest and enthusiasm during the game,\" according to \"The Eastern\", the campus newspaper. Friends and family and alumni were surely well represented, because the twenty-three players constituted almost half of Eastern’s enrollment of fifty-three that term. Robert Nelles and Paul Tommeraasen, two of the three male students, were pressed into service as game officials.\n\n“We tried to be almost real, with huddles and all that,\" said Lowry. \"There was a lot of clowning around. A few of us fell down, just to make it look good, but it wasn’t really rough or anything.\"\n\nThe neophyte gridders proved more adept at defense than offense, with each team holding the other scoreless until the game's final minute. Doris Treloar of the Gold team finally broke through and scored a touchdown, which was immediately answered by Nancy Baughman of the Blue. Professor A.E. Swan, the librarian serving as the referee, considered that an opportune moment to end the contest on an amiable note.\n\nIn its story about the game, the \"Madison Daily Leader\" dubbed the two teams \"The Powderpuff and Rouge Elevens The name was suggested because the women chose to poke fun at themselves by staying on the field at halftime and putting on fresh makeup before the amused spectators.\n\nThe first powderpuff football game of the modern era was held in 1972, in Wallingford, Connecticut. Judy Samaha, a physical education teacher and coach for Mark T. Sheehan High School at the time, began this sport to incorporate more girls into athletic activities. She contacted Lyman Hall High School, Sheehan's rival, to set up a small but fierce game between the schools. Since then, powderpuff football has spread over the nation, from neighboring towns in Connecticut to schools in California, Texas, and Florida. The annual Samaha bowl game still takes place the Wednesday before Thanksgiving as the longest running powderpuff game in the country.\n\nThe tradition was adopted in Massachusetts at schools such as Pope John XXIII High School where underclass girls faced upperclass girls. The tradition still lives with schools like Mystic Valley Regional Charter School playing once a year the day before Thanksgiving Day, or St. David's School in Raleigh, NC, which attracts a stadium full of spectators for a high-energy game under the lights.\n\nBlondes vs. Brunettes is a powderpuff football game played in cities across the United States. Proceeds from the event are donated to the Alzheimer's Association. The annual contests were started by Sara Allen Abbott whose father, Texas State Representative Joseph Hugh Allen, died of Alzheimer's disease in 2008. Looking for a way to raise funds for the Alzheimer's Association, Abbott organized a powderpuff football game in tribute to her father, a lifelong football fan.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, the first blonde vs. brunette powder puff football game was played at Hains Point in Washington, D.C. and raised $10,000. Subsequently, the game searched for a more suitable home and moved around the Washington, D.C area before settling in at George Washington University’s Mount Vernon Athletic Field in 2009. The game has received considerable publicity to include feature articles in \"The Washington Post\" and local TV stations and has raised over $500,000 in the national capital area alone. Blondes vs. Brunettes Charity Football is currently played in 16 cities in the United States. Abbott plans to continue the expansion to more cities and eventually establish a \"Blondes vs. Brunettes Super Bowl.\"\n\nDespite widespread popularity of powderpuff games, they have faced backlash for enforcing gender stereotypes. Teachers and parents alike have criticized the games for \"demeaning women's athletic ability\", citing how the name implies that girls are fragile and only fit to play flag football. There is also the argument that girls should feel like they are able to play football whenever they want, and having to have a special spectacle just for female students to participate in a male-dominated sport is a mockery of the abilities of female athletes.\n\nPowderpuff games have also come under fire for encouraging violence between peers, especially at some schools where junior girls are subject to hazing by the senior class. In 2003, two Chicago area high-schools participated in hazing that led to five girls being hospitalized. School officials noted that the game was not an official, school-sanctioned activity and the school did not promote, plan, or even know about the event.\n\n"}

Other percentages are used to achieve specific results, for example 100% black with 70% cyan (C), 35% magenta (M), and 40% yellow (Y) is used to achieve \"cool\" black. \"Warm Black\" is 35%C, 60%M, 60%Y, and 100%K. The colored ink under the black ink makes a \"richer\" result; the additional inks absorb more light, resulting in a closer approximation of true black. While, in theory, an even richer black can be made by using 100% of each of the four inks, in practice, the amount of non-black ink added is limited by the wetness that the paper and printing process can handle. (A safe and practical rule of thumb is that ink coverage should not exceed 240% on normal papers. Papers that \"pick\", such as low-end recycled papers, should have even less coverage.) Wetness is not a problem with laser printers, however, and registration black (or \"400% black\") produces very striking results in laser prints. Interesting effects can also be achieved with a laser printer by combining 100% black and 100% of cyan, magenta, or yellow.\n\nOther printing standards also provide rich black guidelines, such as FOGRA39 for coated paper (91%C, 79%M, 62%Y, and 97%K), and FOGRA29 for uncoated paper (96%C, 70%M, 46%Y, and 86%K).\n\nRich black is often regarded as a color that is \"blacker than black\". While this is impossible from the point of view of color theory, the difference can often be seen in the printed piece. The difference is most apparent in backlit (also known as \"translite\") pieces, where rich black more thoroughly blocks the light from coming through.\n\nThe use of rich black has to be based on a full understanding of the printing conditions, including the inks, printing press and especially the paper. If too much ink is used on poor quality paper such as newsprint, this may cause the paper to literally fall apart. In addition, excessive amounts of ink may not have a chance to fully dry before the printed result comes into contact with other pages. The additional ink used to create rich black also results in higher printing costs.\n\nCare must be taken when using electronic design programs (e.g. when managing a CMYK document in Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw) – \"black\" may or may not equal 100%K depending on the CMYK profile specified in the image's settings, and Photoshop will represent the various tones using RGB values close to black; in an RGB document, \"black\" always equals RGB value (0, 0, 0).\n\nAnother reason to use rich black for small areas of black is to avoid trapping issues. Rich black is often used for text printed over a picture or colored background, because otherwise any slight mis-registration between printing plates would produce a white or colored halo around the text, making it much harder to read.\n\n"}

The terms top, bottom and switch are also used in BDSM, with slightly different meanings. In both contexts, the terms \"top\" and \"bottom\" refer to dominant or submissive, or active and passive roles, not to who is physically on top in a particular sexual act.\n\nThere is considerable controversy about the prevalence of tops and bottoms among male/female and straight/gay populations.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, in some American contexts, people would identify their interests by wearing a set of keys on the side of their belt or a color-coded handkerchief in their rear pockets. This practice, called \"flagging\", began in the gay male subculture.\n\nIn BDSM, \"top\" means:\n\nIn BDSM, \"bottom\" means:\n\nA bottom in BDSM does not have to be the receptive partner; for example, a female dominant may command her submissive to penetrate her.\n\nA switch is someone who participates in BDSM activities sometimes as a top and other times as a bottom or (in the case of dominance and submission) sometimes as a dominant and other times as a submissive. This is sometimes referred to as being \"versatile\".\n\nThose who take the superior position in dominance and submission scenes and relationships are called dominants, doms (male) or dommes (female), while those who take the subordinate position are called submissives or subs (male or female). A top filling the \"dominant role\" is not necessarily \"a\" dominant, and vice versa, and a bottom is not necessarily submissive.\n\nThe main difference between a dominant and a top is that the dominant ostensibly does not follow instructions, although they are limited by what the submissive is willing to do. The top may sometimes even be the partner who is \"following\" instructions, i.e., they top when, and in the manner, requested by the bottom. Contrast this with the pure dominant, who might give orders to a submissive, or otherwise employ physical or psychological techniques of control, but might instruct the submissive to perform the act on them.\n\nThe main difference between a submissive and a bottom is that the submissive ostensibly does not give instructions, although they do set limits on what the dominant can do. A bottom is not necessarily a submissive; they may enjoy intense physical and psychological stimulation but not submit to the person delivering it. Similarly, a submissive might not be a bottom; they may enjoy taking orders from a dominant without receiving any physical stimulation. For \"bottoms\" who are not submissive, the bottom is most often the partner who is giving instructions—the top typically tops when, and in the manner, requested by the bottom.\n\nMany distinguish top/bottom from dominant/submissive by seeing top/bottom as an expression of physical power, while dominant/submissive is an expression of psychological power. In many cases, the dominant/submissive relationship involves the dominant party psychologically tearing down and denigrating the submissive (consensually, meeting the submissive's expressed needs and respecting hard limits).

Born in 1980 in Ternopil region of Ukraine. His publications include \"Багряна лірика\" (2012), \"Час Революції\" (2014), and \"На зламі епох\" (2015). His poetry was also included in Ukrainian modern nationalist poetry compilations \"Голос крові\" (2013), and \"Відлуння свинцевих громовиць\" (2015).\n\nYuriy Ruf began writing poetry when he was 14 years old. He is known for his critical views toward traditional Ukrainian poetry where, according to him, Ukrainians are predominantly portrayed as poor and ill-fated. He believes such poetry lowers self-esteem and a sense of national pride. He, therefore, considers his poetry to be a type of poetic propaganda of patriotism. Fans describe his poetry as \"front line lyrics\", that is poetry of war and patriotism aimed at raising fighting spirit, delivering motivation, and a sense of national pride.\n\nHis most recent publication \"На зламі епох\" (2015) is dedicated to Ukrainian heroes of the current Russian-Ukrainian war, and contains verses honoring certain individuals, military units, Ukrainian soldiers, battles, and other wartime events.\n\nHe lives in Lviv, and is a father of two children.\n"}
