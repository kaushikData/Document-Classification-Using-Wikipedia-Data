They are often offered steep discounts on rent in exchange for signing long-term leases, in order to provide steady cash flows for the mall owners.\n\nWhen the planned shopping centre format was developed by Victor Gruen in the early to mid-1950s, signing larger department stores was necessary for the financial stability of the projects, and to draw retail traffic that would result in visits to the smaller shops in the centre as well. Anchors generally have their rents heavily discounted, and may even receive cash inducements from the centre to remain open.\n\nEarly on, grocery stores were a common type of anchor store, since they are visited often.

A copy of the translation is preserved in the library of the British and Foreign Bible Society in London.\n\nThe first published translation of the Bible into Manchu was made by Stepan Vaciliyevich Lipovtsov [Степан Васильевич Липовцов] (1770–1841). Lipovtsov had been a member of the eighth Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Beijing from 1794 to 1807, where he had learned Manchu, and was later a member of the Russian Foreign Office. The British and Foreign Bible Society commissioned Lipovtsov to translate the Gospel of Matthew into Manchu. In 1822, 550 copies of the translated Gospel of Matthew were printed in Saint Petersburg; however, most of these were destroyed in a flood.\n\nIn 1833 the British and Foreign Bible Society sent George Borrow (1803–1881) to Russia to supervise the completion of the translation of the New Testament into Manchu. Borrow learned Manchu in six months using Lipovtsov's translation and a Manchu-French dictionary. Within two years Lipovtsov and Borrow had completed the translation of the New Testament, and in 1835, 1,000 copies were printed in Saint Petersburg. Borrow wanted to go to China to distribute the translation, but the Russian authorities refused to let him take the Bible with him in case it damaged diplomatic relations between Russia and China. It was not until ten years later that the translation made its way to China. In 1859, parallel Chinese and Manchu translations of the Gospels of Matthew and Mark were printed in China, but by then Manchu was no longer a widely spoken language. A reprint of the Manchu translation of the New Testament was made in Shanghai in 1929.\n\nThe following is a sample showing the Manchu translation of the Lord's Prayer from \"Gospel of Matthew\" chapter 6 verses 9–13, together with the corresponding English translation from the \"Authorized King James Version\" of 1611.\n\n"}

Many logicians distinguish, sometimes only tacitly, between the domain of a science and the universe of discourse of a formalization of the science. Giuseppe Peano formalized number theory (arithmetic of positive integers) taking its domain to be the positive integers and the universe of discourse to include all numbers, not just integers .\n\nFor example, in an interpretation of first-order logic, the domain of discourse is the set of individuals over which the quantifiers range.

The Gaels are an ethno-linguistic group, traditionally viewed as having spread from Ireland to Scotland and the Isle of Man.\n\n\"Gaelic\", as a linguistic term, refers to the Gaelic languages but can also refer to the transmission of any other Gaelic cultural feature such as social norms and customs, music and sport.\n\nExamples of Gaelicisation in history include the Picts, Hiberno-Normans, Scoto-Normans and Norse-Gaels.\n\nToday, Gaelicisation, or more often re-Gaelicisation, of placenames, surnames and given names is often a deliberate effort to help promote the languages and to counteract centuries of Anglicisation.\n\nThe Manx language, which is very similar to Irish, has undergone a major revival very recently, despite the language being so rarely used that it was even mislabelled as extinct by a United Nations report as recently as 2009. The decline of the language on the island was primarily as a result of stigmatisation and high levels of emigration to England.\n\nThere are now primary schools teaching in the medium of Manx Gaelic, after efforts mainly modelled on the Irish system. The efforts have been widely praised, with further developments such as using technology to teach the language being put into place.\n\nEstimates of numbers of native speakers of the Irish language in the Republic of Ireland in 2000 ranged from 20,000 to 80,000. According to the 2006 census for the Republic, 85,000 people used Irish daily outside of school and 1.2 million used Irish at least occasionally. In the 2011 Census, these numbers increased to 94,000 and 1.3 million, respectively. Active Irish speakers probably comprise 5 to 10 per cent of Ireland's population.\n\nIn recent decades there has been a significant increase in the number of urban Irish speakers, particularly in Dublin. The dispersed but large, educated and middle-class urban Gaeilgoir community enjoys a lively cultural life and is buoyed by the growth of Irish medium education and Irish-language media.\n\nIn some official Gaeltachtaí (Irish-speaking regions) areas, Irish remains a vernacular language alongside English.\n\nIn Scotland, Scottish Gaelic is widely spoken in the Scottish Lowlands, with about half of Gaelic speakers living outside the traditional Gàidhealtachd, largely due to migration and the expansion of Gaelic medium education in the Lowlands. In the 21st century, phrases such as \"Alba gu bràth\" and \"Saor Alba\" have been appropriated as catchphrases and rallying cries for Scottish identity and the Scottish independence movement.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "752720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=752720", "title": "Gemination", "text": "Gemination\n\nIn phonetics and phonology, gemination (), or consonant lengthening, is an articulation of a consonant for a longer period of time than that of a single instance of the same type of consonant. It is distinct from stress and may appear independently of it. \"Gemination\" literally means \"twinning\" and comes from the same Latin root as \"Gemini\".\n\nConsonant length is distinctive in some languages, like Arabic, Berber, Maltese, Catalan, Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Classical Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu. Most languages (including English) do not have distinctive long consonants, however.\n\nVowel length is distinctive in more languages than consonant length is. Several languages, like Arabic, Japanese, Finnish and Estonian, feature both independently, however; others, like Italian, Norwegian and Swedish, have interdependent vowel and consonant length.\n\nLengthened fricatives, nasals, laterals, approximants and trills are simply prolonged. In lengthened stops, the obstruction of the airway is prolonged, which delays release, and the \"hold\" is lengthened.\n\nLong consonants are usually pronounced one-and-a-half to two times as long as short consonants, depending on the language.\n\nGemination of consonants is distinctive in some languages and then is subject to various phonological constraints that depend on the language.\n\nIn some languages, like Italian, Swedish, Faroese, Icelandic, many Finnish dialects and Luganda, consonant length and vowel length depend on each other. A short vowel within a stressed syllable almost always precedes a long consonant or a consonant cluster, and a long vowel must be followed by a short consonant. In Classical Arabic, a long vowel was lengthened even more before permanently-geminate consonants, but that no longer occurs in modern varieties of Arabic or even Modern Standard Arabic.\n\nIn other languages, such as Finnish, consonant length and vowel length are independent of each other. In Finnish, both are phonemic; \"back\", \"fireplace\" and \"burden\" are different, unrelated words. Finnish consonant length is also affected by consonant gradation. Another important phenomenon is sandhi, which produces long consonants to word boundaries from an archiphonemic glottal stop > \"take it!\"\n\nAlso, in some Finnish compound words, if the initial word ends in an , the initial consonant of the following word is geminated: \"trash bag\" , \"welcome\" . In certain cases, a after a is geminated by most people: \"screw\" , \"baby\" . In the Tampere dialect, if a word receives gemination of after , the is often deleted: , and \"Saturday\" receive a medial and so a further deletion of may occur: .\n\nDistinctive consonant length is usually restricted to certain consonants. There are very few languages that have initial consonant length; among them are Pattani Malay, Chuukese, Moroccan Arabic, a few Romance languages such as Sicilian and Neapolitan as well as many High Alemannic German dialects, such as that of Thurgovia. Some African languages, such as Setswana and Luganda, also have initial consonant length: it is very common in Luganda and indicates certain grammatical features. In Colloquial Finnish and spoken Italian, long consonants are produced between words because of sandhi.\n\nThe reverse of gemination reduces a long consonant to a short one, which is called \"degemination\". It is a pattern in Baltic-Finnic consonant gradation that the strong grade (often the nominative) form of the word is degeminated into a weak grade (often all the other cases) form of the word: > (burden, of the burden). As an historical restructuring at the phonemic level, word-internal long consonants degeminated in Western Romance languages: e.g. Spanish /ˈboka/ 'mouth' vs. Italian /ˈbokka/, the latter of which continues Latin geminate /kk/.\n\nArabic marks gemination with a diacritic () shaped like a rounded \"w\", called the shadda (). It is written above the consonant that is to be doubled. It is sometimes used to avoid ambiguity in text that otherwise lacks diacritics, and is the diacritic most commonly used in this way: for example, a shadda can distinguish \"female teacher\" from \"school\" (with full diacritics: and ).\n\nIn Berber, each consonant has a geminate counterpart, and gemination is lexically contrastive. The distinction between single and geminate consonants is attested in medial position as well as in absolute initial and final positions.\n\n\nIn addition to lexical geminates, Berber also has phonologically-derived and morphologically-derived geminates . Phonologically-derived geminates can surface by concatenation (e.g. 'give him two!') or by complete assimilation (e.g. 'he will touch you'). The morphological alternations include imperfective gemination, with some Berber verbs forming their\nimperfective stem by geminating one consonant in their perfective stem (e.g. 'go! PF', 'go! IMPF'), as well as quantity alternations between singular and plural forms (e.g. 'hand', 'hands').\n\nIn Catalan, geminates are expressed in writing with consonant repetition, such as 'unnecessary', which is pronounced in careful speech. Gemination is not represented if it is purely phonetic, such as the assimilation occurring in 'all good'. Since the repetition of the letter generates the digraph , which represents the phoneme , the geminate is represented as two \"l\"s separated by a or centered dot ():\n\nDanish has a three-way consonant length distinction. For instance:\n\n\nThe word can phonemically be analyzed as , with the middle schwa being assimilated to .\n\nIn English phonology, consonant length is not distinctive within root words. For instance, \"baggage\" is pronounced , not . However, phonetic gemination does occur marginally.\n\nGemination is found across words and across morphemes when the last consonant in a given word and the first consonant in the following word are the same fricative, nasal, or stop. For instance:\n\nWith affricates, however, this does not occur. For instance:\n\nIn most instances, the absence of this doubling does not affect the meaning, though it may confuse the listener momentarily. The following minimal pairs represent examples where the doubling \"does\" affect the meaning in most accents:\n\n\nIn some dialects gemination is also found when the suffix \"-ly\" follows a root ending in -l or -ll, as in:\n\nIn some varieties of Welsh English, the process takes place indiscriminately between vowels, e.g. in \"money\" but it also applies with graphemic duplication (thus, orthographically dictated), e.g. \"butter\" \n\nEstonian has three phonemic lengths; however, the third length is a suprasegmental feature, which is as much tonal patterning as a length distinction. It is traceable to allophony caused by now-deleted suffixes, for example half-long < * \"of the city\" vs. overlong < * \"to the city\".\n\nConsonant length is phonemic in Finnish: For example, (transcribed with the length sign or with a doubled sign ), 'fireplace', but , 'back'. Consonant gemination occurs with simple consonants () and between syllables in the pattern (consonant)-vowel-sonorant-stop-stop-vowel (), but not generally in codas or with longer syllables. (This occurs in Sami languages, so there is the name of Sami origin ).\n\nSandhi may also produce geminates. Consonant and vowel gemination are both phonemic and occur independently, e.g. , , , (Mali (a Karelian surname), paint, model and secular, respectively).\n\nIn Standard Finnish, consonant gemination of exists only in interjections, new loan words and in the playful word \"hihhuli\", with its origins in the 19th century, and derivatives of that word.\n\nIn multiple Finnish dialects there are also types of special gemination when in contact with long vowels: Southwestern special gemination (\"Lounaismurteiden erikoisgeminaatio\") (lengthening of stops+shortening of long vowel), with the type , the \"Common gemination\" (\"Yleisgeminaatio\") (all consonants in short, stressed syllables are lengthened), with the type , and its extension (which is strongest in the northwestern Savonian dialects), the \"Eastern dialectal special gemination\" (\"Itämurteiden erikoisgeminaatio\") (same as the Common gradation, but applies also to unstressed syllables and certain clusters), with the types and .\n\nIn French, consonant length is usually not distinctive, but in certain exceptional cases it can be, such as the pair vs . Gemination also occurs in case of schwa elision.\n\nGanda is unusual in that gemination can occur word-initially, as well as word-medially. For example, 'cat', 'grandfather' and 'madam' all begin with geminate consonants.\n\nThere are three consonants that cannot be geminated: , and . Whenever morphological rules would geminate these consonants, and are prefixed with , and changes to . For example:\n\nIn Ancient Greek, consonant length was distinctive, e.g., \"I am of interest\" vs. \"I am going to\". The distinction has been lost in the standard and most other varieties, with the exception of Cypriot (where it might carry over from Ancient Greek or arise from a number of synchronic and diachronic assimilatory processes, or even spontaneously), some varieties of the southeastern Aegean, and Italy.\n\nGemination is common in Hindi and Urdu. It is found in words of both Indic and Arabic origin, but not in those of Persian origin:\n\n\nFor aspirated consonants, the geminate is formed by combining the corresponding non-aspirated consonant followed by its aspirated counterpart. There are few examples where an aspirated consonant is truly doubled.\n\n\nIn Hungarian, consonant length is phonemic, e.g. , 'goes' and , 'sour cherry'.\n\nIn Standard Italian, consonant length is distinctive. For example, , meaning \"he/she drank\", is phonemically and pronounced , while (\"he/she drinks/is drinking\") is , pronounced . Tonic syllables are bimoraic and are therefore composed of either a long vowel in an open syllable (as in ) or a short vowel in a closed syllable (as in ). In varieties with post-vocalic weakening of some consonants (e.g. → 'reason'), geminates are not affected ( → 'May'). \n\nDouble or long consonants occur not only within words but also at word boundaries, and they are then pronounced but not necessarily written: + = (\"who knows\") and (\"I am going home\") (the latter example refers to central and southern standard Italian). All consonants except can be geminated. This word-initial gemination is triggered either lexically by the item preceding the lengthening consonant (e.g. by preposition \"a\" 'to, at' in [akˈkaːsa] \"a casa\" 'homeward' but not by definite article \"la\" in [laˈkaːsa] \"la casa\" 'the house'), or by any word-final stressed vowel ([parˈlɔffranˈt͡ʃeːze] \"parlò francese\" 's/he spoke French' but [ˈparlafranˈt͡ʃeːze] \"parla francese\" 's/he speaks French').\n\nIn Japanese, consonant length is distinctive (as is vowel length). Gemination in the syllabary is represented with the sokuon, a small \"tsu\": っ for hiragana in native words and ッ for katakana in foreign words. For example, 来た (きた, \"kita\") means \"came; arrived\", while 切った (きった, \"kitta\") means \"cut; sliced\". With the influx of \"gairaigo\" (\"foreign words\") into Modern Japanese, voiced consonants have become able to geminate as well: バグ (\"bagu\") means \"(computer) bug\", and バッグ (\"baggu\") means \"bag\". Distinction between voiceless gemination and voiced gemination is visible in pairs of words such as キット (\"kitto\", meaning \"kit\") and キッド (\"kiddo\", meaning \"kid\"). In addition, in some variants of colloquial Modern Japanese, gemination may be applied to some adjectives and adverbs (regardless of voicing) in order to add emphasis: すごい (\"sugoi\", \"amazing\") contrasts with すっごい (\"suggoi\", \"\"really\" amazing\"); 思い切り (おもいきり, \"omoikiri\", \"with all one's strength\") contrasts with 思いっ切り (おもいっきり, \"omoikkiri\", \"\"really\" with all one's strength\").\n\nIn Korean, geminates arise from assimilation, and they are distinctive.\n\nIn Latin, consonant length was distinctive, as in \"anus\" vs. \"year\". (Vowel length was also distinctive in Latin, but is not reflected in the orthography.) Geminates inherited from Latin still exist in Italian, in which and contrast with regard to and as in Latin. It has been almost completely lost in French and completely in Romanian. In West Iberian languages, former Latin geminate consonants often evolved to new phonemes, including some instances of nasal vowels in Portuguese and Old Galician as well as most cases of and in Spanish, but phonetic length of both consonants and vowels is no longer distinctive.\n\nIn Malayalam, compounding is phonologically conditioned so gemination occurs at words' internal boundaries.\n\nConsider following example:\n\nIn Marathi, the compounding occurs quite frequently, as in the words haṭṭa (stubbornness), kaṭṭā (platform) or sattā (power). It seems to happen most commonly with the dental and retroflex consonants.\n\nGemination is indicated in writing by double consonants. Gemination often differentiates between otherwise unrelated words.\n\n\nIn Polish, consonant length is indicated with two identical letters. Examples:\n\n\nConsonant length is distinctive and sometimes is necessary to distinguish words:\n\n\nDouble consonants are common on morpheme borders where the initial or final sound of the suffix is the same as the final or initial sound of the stem (depending on the position of the suffix). Examples:\n\n\nPunjabi in its official script Gurmukhi uses a diacritic called an áddak ( ) (, ) which is written above the word and indicates that the following consonant is geminate. Gemination is specially characteristic of Punjabi compared to other Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi-Urdu, where instead of the presence of consonant lengthening, the preceding vowel tends to be lengthened. Consonant length is distinctive in Punjabi, for example:\n\n\nIn Russian, consonant length (indicated with two letters, as in 'bathtub') may occur in several situations.\n\nMinimal pairs (or chronemes) exist, such as 'to hold' vs 'to support', and their conjugations, or 'length' vs 'long' adj. f.\n\n\nMost Sami languages contrast three different degrees of consonant length. These often contrast in different forms within a single inflectional paradigm, as in Northern Sami \"goarˈrut\" \"let's sew!\" versus \"goarrut\" \"to sew, we sew\" versus \"goarut\" \"you (sg.) sew\". Often, progressively longer consonants correspond to a progressively shorter preceding vowel.\n\nIn Proto-Samic, the common ancestor of the Sami languages, there was already a contrast between single and geminate consonants, inherited from Proto-Uralic. A process called consonant gradation then lengthened all consonants when they stood at the end of a stressed syllable, if the next syllable was open. The subsequent loss of final consonants and vowels in the later Sami languages made this process contrastive, resulting in as many as four contrastive lengths (lengthened geminate, unlengthened geminate, lengthened single, unlengthened single). The modern Sami languages have reduced this to three, by merging the unlengthened geminates with the lengthened single consonants.\n\nIn Turkish, gemination in word stem is exclusive to loanwords. Gemination is indicated by two identical letters as in most languages that have phonemic gemination.\n\n\nLoanwords originally ending with a geminated consonant are always written and pronounced without the ending gemination.\n\n\nAlthough gemination is resurrected when the word takes a suffix.\n\n\nGemination also occurs when a suffix starting with a consonant comes after a word that ends with the same consonant.\n\n\nIn Ukrainian, geminates are found between vowels: \"bonfire\", \"married couple\", \"face\". Geminates also occur at the start of a few words: \"flaxen\", forms of the verb \"to pour\" ( , etc.), \"to suck\" and derivatives. Gemination is in some cases semantically crucial; for example, means \"manna\" or \"semolina\" while means \"delusion\".\n\nIn Wagiman, an indigenous Australian language, consonant length in stops is the primary phonetic feature that differentiates fortis and lenis stops. Wagiman does not have phonetic voice. Word-initial and word-final stops never contrast for length.\n\nIn written language, consonant length is often indicated by writing a consonant twice (\"ss\", \"kk\", \"pp\", and so forth), but can also be indicated with a special symbol, such as the shadda in Arabic, the dagesh in Classical Hebrew, or the sokuon in Japanese. Estonian uses \"b\", \"d\", \"g\" for short consonants, and \"p\", \"t\", \"k\" and \"pp\", \"tt\", \"kk\" are used for long consonants.\n\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet, long consonants are normally written using the triangular colon , e.g. \"penne\" ('feathers', 'pens', also a kind of pasta), though doubled letters are also used (especially for underlying phonemic forms, or in tone languages to facilitate diacritic marking).\n\n\nDoubled orthographic consonants do not always indicate a long phonetic consonant.\n\n\n"}

Representative of comedic debate, Impromptu debating is practiced at high schools, generally in tandem with other, more serious forms of debate. In some areas, such as portions of Canada, impromptu debate is treated as formally as Parliamentary debate.\n\nImpromptu is an individual event that consists of just one competitor giving a speech against other competitors that give their speech at a separate time. Impromptu differs from other forms of debate because an emphasis on humour is usually given, as well as on logic and performance. The resolutions debated often encourage humorous debates. Further, this form of debate is focused on a specific topic or a quotation. The competitor has a very short window of time usually not more than a few minutes to come up with a speech that generally lasts for a few minutes. This speech is based upon how the speaker interprets the message and whether or not the speaker agrees with the quotation. Many colleges and universities compete in this as well as other forms of speech throughout the US. \n\nEach team comprises two members, each of whom is named according to their team and speaking position within his or her team. The Impromptu format varies, depending on what \"traditional\" debate format on what it is based. An impromptu debate in Policy debate style, for example, might follow the Policy speech format, but with radically altered content or speech durations.\n\nsess.usask.ca The format is conducted in a different way than typical debates. The rules are bent in order to provide the students who have minimal to zero experience in debating to be able to take part in the debate. \n\nJSA Impromptu debate format usually consists of choosing two volunteers out of the students attending the block and then having the audience assign a topic to them.\n\nThere are several methods of judging an Impromptu debate. The most standard method is when a single judge observes the debate and simply votes one way or another; however, it is sometimes acceptable to have the audience (if it is sufficiently large) cast votes, with the winner determined by majority.\n\nsess.usask.ca Although, there are other ways to judge these types of debates. One way is to have a minimum of three judges that all come from different backgrounds - providing diversity and different views.

{"id": "711797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=711797", "title": "Isogloss", "text": "Isogloss\n\nAn isogloss, also called a heterogloss (see Etymology below), is the geographic boundary of a certain linguistic feature, such as the pronunciation of a vowel, the meaning of a word, or the use of some morphological or syntactic feature. Major dialects are typically demarcated by \"bundles\" of isoglosses, such as the Benrath line that distinguishes High German from the other West Germanic languages and the La Spezia–Rimini Line that divides the Northern Italian dialects from Central Italian dialects. However, an \"individual\" isogloss may or may not have any coincidence with a language border. For example, the front-rounding of /y/ cuts across France and Germany, while the /y/ is absent from Italian and Spanish words that are cognates with the /y/-containing French words.\n\nOne of the best-known isoglosses is the centum-satem isogloss.\n\nSimilar to an isogloss, an isograph is a distinguishing feature of a writing system. Both concepts are also used in historical linguistics.\n\nThe centum-satem isogloss of the Indo-European language family relates to the different evolution of the dorsal consonants of Proto-Indo-European (PIE). In the standard reconstruction, three series of dorsals are recognised:\n\nIn some branches (for example Greek, Italic and Germanic), the palatals merged with the velars: PIE \"tremble (inwardly)\" became Latin cupiō\" \"desire\" and \"hundred\" became Latin centum\" (pronounced [kentum]); but \"interrogative pronoun\" became \"quō\" \"how? where?\". They are known as \"centum\" branches, named after the Latin word for \"hundred\".\n\nIn other branches (for example, Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian), the labiovelars merged with the velars: PIE became Vedic Sanskrit kopáyati\" \"shaken\" and became Avestan \"kō\" \"who?\"; but became Avestan satəm\". They are known as \"satem\" branches, after the Avestan word for \"hundred\".\n\nSince the Balto-Slavic family, the Indo-Iranian family, and the other \"satem\" families are spoken in adjacent geographic regions, they can be grouped by an isogloss: a geographic line separating \"satem\" branches on one side from \"centum\" branches on the other.\n\nA major isogloss in American English has been identified as the North-Midland isogloss, which demarcates numerous linguistic features, including the Northern Cities vowel shift: regions north of the line (including Western New York; Cleveland, Ohio; lower Michigan; northern Illinois; and eastern Wisconsin) have the shift, while regions south of the line (including Pennsylvania, central and southern Ohio, and most of Indiana) do not.\n\nA feature of the ancient Northwest Semitic languages is \"w\" becoming \"y\" at the beginning of a word. Thus, in Proto-Semitic and subsequent non-Northwest Semitic languages and dialects, the root letters for a word for \"child\" were \"w-l-d\". However, in the ancient Northwest Semitic languages, the word was \"y-l-d\", with \"w-\" > \"y-\".\n\nSimilarly, Proto-Semitic \"ā\" becomes \"ō\" in the Canaanite dialects of Northwest Semitic. Within the Aramaic languages and dialects of Northwest Semitic, the historic \"ā\" is preserved. Thus, an ancient Northwest Semitic language whose historic \"ā\" became \"ō\" can be classed as part of the Canaanite branch of Northwest Semitic.\n\nSuch features can be used as data of fundamental importance for the purposes of linguistic classification.\n\nJust as there are distinguishing features of related languages, there are also distinguishing features of related scripts. (For a discussion of writing systems, see \"The World's Writing Systems\".)\n\nFor example, a distinguishing feature of the Iron Age Old Hebrew script is that the letters \"bet\", \"dalet\", \"'ayin\" and \"resh\" do not have an open head, but contemporary Aramaic has open-headed forms. Similarly, the \"bet\" of Old Hebrew has a distinctive stance (it leans to the right), but the \"bet\" of the Aramaic and Phoenician scripts series has a different stance (in both, it leans to the left). \n\nIn 2006, Christopher Rollston suggested using the term \"isograph\" to designate a feature of the script that distinguishes it from a related script series, such as a feature that distinguishes the script of Old Hebrew from Old Aramaic and Phoenician.\n\nThe term \"isogloss\" (Ancient Greek \"ísos\" \"equal, similar\" and \"glōssa\" \"tongue, dialect, language\") is inspired by contour lines, or isopleths, such as isobars. However, the isogloss separates rather than connects points. Consequently, it has been proposed for the term \"heterogloss\" ( \"héteros\" \"other\") to be used instead.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "415478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415478", "title": "Jab", "text": "Jab\n\nA jab is a type of punch used in the martial arts. Several variations of the jab exist, but every jab shares these characteristics: while in a fighting stance, the lead fist is thrown straight ahead and the arm is fully extended. It is an overhand punch; at the moment of impact, the pronated fist is generally held in a horizontal orientation with the palm facing the ground.\n\nThe word jab was first used in 1825, to mean \"to thrust with a point.\" The term is a Scottish variant of the word \"job\", which means \"to strike, pierce, thrust.\"\n\nA jab is an integral part of a fighter's defense. Its speed and power of execution and reach can keep the opponent at a distance, preventing him from charging in. Defensive jabs can be employed while moving backwards.\n\nThis jab gives a fighter high mobility and is often used with the intention of scoring points. Fighters use this variation of the jab when they want to preserve the mobility and balance of their stance.\n\nUsed in order to establish a feeling for distance, the rangefinding jab is often used to set up a power punch with the other hand. Thus it can help conserve stamina and lower the risk of being countered by allowing the fighter to commit his stronger hand only when he is within proper range.\n\nBoxers have been wobbled by a rangefinding jab.\n\nPower can be added to a jab if it is thrown with a moderate step forward. The drawback to this technique is that it takes the fighter out of his boxing stance, committing him to the punch rather more than the speed jab. A \"pivot jab\" is the most powerful jab, one in which the weight shifts almost entirely to the lead foot, which pivots to put the mass of the body behind the punch. Jabbing from the hip, rather than from a tight guard, will add power to the jab at the expense of speed.\n\nJabbing to the body is relatively uncommon, because it increases a fighter's vulnerability to a counterpunch. Typically, the fighter bends at the waist and fires a speed jab to the midsection of his opponent in an attempt at getting the opponent to drop his guard. It is impractical to put the body weight behind this punch, so power is limited. The jab to the body can be used effectively to counter the opponents lead jab.\n\n\nHistorians consider some of the best \"jabbers\" in history to be Sonny Liston, Larry Holmes, Muhammad Ali, Hector Camacho, and Sugar Ray Leonard. Recent master jabbers include Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko, both coached by the same trainer and able to develop significant power into their jabs.\nHolmes' jab has often been called \"the best among Heavyweights\", Ali's jab was famous for its speed and Liston's for its power. Mike Tyson used a rare version of a slip jab, that allowed him to jab effectively against taller opponents with longer reach.\n\n"}

From the two stems given in dictionaries (e.g. \"gir, gereft\" 'take, took', \"nevis, nevešt\" 'write, wrote', \"deh, dād\" 'give, gave' etc.) it is possible to make all the other forms of almost any verb. The main irregularity is that given one stem it is not usually possible to predict the other. Another irregularity is that the verb 'to be' has no stem in the present tense.\n\nPersian verbs are inflected for three singular and three plural persons. The 2nd and 3rd person plural are often used when referring to singular persons for politeness.\n\nThere are fewer tenses in Persian than in English. There are about ten tenses in all. The greatest variety is shown in tenses referring to past events. A series of past tenses (\"past simple\", \"imperfect\", and \"pluperfect\") is matched by a corresponding series of perfect tenses (\"perfect simple\", \"perfect continuous\", and \"perfect pluperfect\" — the last of these made by adding a perfect ending to the pluperfect tense). These perfect tenses are used sometimes much as the English perfect tense (e.g. 'I have done' etc.), but often in an inferential or reportative sense ('apparently I had done' etc.), similar to the perfect tense in Turkish.\n\nThe \"present\" tense has a range of meanings (habitual, progressive, punctual, historic). In colloquial Persian this tense is also used with future meaning, although there also exists a separate future tense used in formal styles. In colloquial Persian there are also three progressive tenses (present, past, and perfect).\n\nThere are two subjunctive mood forms, present and perfect. Subjunctive verbs are often used where English uses an infinitive, e.g. 'I want to go' is expressed in Persian as 'I want I may go'.\n\nA perfect participle is made by adding \"-e\" to the second stem. This participle is active in intransitive verbs, e.g. \"rafte\" 'gone', but passive in transitive verbs, e.g. \"nevešte\" 'written (by someone)'. As well as being used to make the perfect tenses, this perfect participle can be used to make the passive of transitive verbs, by adding different parts of the verb \"šodan\" 'to become'.\n\nCompound verbs, such as \"bāz kardan\" 'to open' (lit. 'to make open') and \"yād gereftan\" 'to learn', are very frequently used in modern Persian.\n\nIn colloquial Persian, commonly used verbs tend to be pronounced in an abbreviated form, for example \"ast\" 'he is' is pronounced \"e\", \"miravad\" 'he goes' is pronounced \"mire\", and \"miguyam\" 'I say' is pronounced \"migam\".\n\nIn Persian the verb usually comes at the end of the clause, although there are sometimes exceptions (for example in colloquial Persian it is common to hear phrases such as \"raftam Tehrān\" 'I went to Tehran' where the destination follows the verb).\n\nInfinitives end in تن (\"-tan\") or دن (\"-dan\"). The principle parts of a verb are the infinitive stem and present stem. The infinitive stem (often called the past stem) is made simply by removing the ن (\"-an\") from the infinitive:\n\n\nThe present stem tends to vary more, and in many common verbs bears little resemblance to the infinitive stem:\n\n\nThe present indicative, present subjunctive, and present participle are made from the present stem, other tenses from the infinitive stem. Both stems can be used to make verbal nouns such as گفتوگو \"goftogu\" (or \"goftegu\") 'dialogue', رفت وآمد \"raft o āmad\" 'going and coming', خوش نويس \"xošnevis\" 'calligrapher'.\n\nThe infinitive itself differs in usage from the English infinitive; for example, the subjunctive not the infinitive is used in sentences such as 'I want to go' or 'I am able to go'. The Persian infinitive is more like a verbal noun or gerund, used in phrases such as نوشتن اين کتاب \"neveštan-e in ketāb\" 'the writing of this book' or اختراع نوشتن \"exterā'-e neveštan\" 'the invention of writing'.\n\nNote that in the transliteration used in this article, the letter 'x' represents a velar fricative sound, similar to the 'ch' in \"Bach\" or \"Loch Ness\", and 'š' and 'č' represent the sounds of English 'sh' and 'ch'.\n\nPersian verbs have two participles - perfect and present.\n\nThe perfect participle is formed by adding ه \"-e\" to the infinitive stem. It is passive in transitive verbs but active in intransitive verbs (e.g. \"rafte\" 'gone').\n\nAs well as being used to make the perfect tenses, the perfect participle can be used as an adjective or noun:\n\nThe present participle, which is less common, is formed by adding نده \"-ande\" to the present stem. Usually this is used as an agent noun (e.g. نويسنده \"nevisande\" 'writer'), though sometimes it is a verbal adjective (e.g. سال آينده \"sāl-e āyande\" 'the coming year', i.e. 'next year'). A true participle ending in \"-ān\" (e.g. خندان \"xandān\" 'smiling') also exists for some verbs.\n\nPersonal forms of verbs are formed mostly with simple suffixes. The personal suffixes for the present and future tense and the two subjunctive tenses are:\n\nThe 2nd and 3rd persons plural are often used when referring to singular persons in a polite or formal setting.\n\nThe past, imperfect, and pluperfect tenses have very similar endings, except that there is no ending in the 3rd person singular:\n\nThese same endings are used for the verbs هست \"hast\" 'he is' and نيست \"nist\" 'he isn't', despite their being present tenses.\n\nThere is no ending in the 3rd person singular, but often in informal speech, the suffix \"-eš\" (lit. 'his/her') is added to supply the gap, e.g. \"goft-eš\" 'he said'.\n\nThe perfect tenses have the following personal endings:\n\nExamples of various tenses are given below using the verb کردن \"kardan\" 'to do'. Note that personal pronouns are frequently dropped and are provided here for clarity.\n\nThe present tense is formed by prefixing می \"mi-\" to the present stem with personal endings:\n\n\nThe negative is made with the prefix \"ne-\", which is stressed: \"man nemikonam\" 'I don't do'.\n\nIn classical Persian the present tense is often found without the prefix \"mi-\", but in modern Persian \"mi-\" is always added except in the verb \"dāram\" 'I have', where it is usually omitted.\n\nThe present tense has various present meanings (general, habitual, progressive, performative); it can also have a future meaning (see below). Colloquially the present tense can also be used as a historical present when narrating events of the past, especially when relating events which occurred suddenly or unexpectedly.\n\nAnother meaning is the equivalent of an English perfect continuous in sentences such as:\n\nThe present tense of the verb بودن \"budan\" 'to be' is irregular in that it has no present stem. Instead it consists of enclitic words which cannot be used without a preceding noun or adjective. They are as follows:\n\n\nAn example of the use of these is as follows:\n\nThere is also an emphatic form of the present tense of 'to be', which despite being a present tense, has the endings of a past tense as follows:\n\nYet another, but less commonly used, form of the verb 'to be' is \"mibāšam\" 'I am', etc., which has the normal present tense endings.\n\nThe negative of the verb 'to be' in modern Persian is \"nistam\" 'I am not', which has the same endings as \"hastam\".\n\nThe present tense can be reinforced in its progressive meaning by adding the present tense of داشتن \"dāštan\" 'to have' before the main verb. It is used in colloquial Persian only:\n\n\nThe two halves of the verb are usually separated by other words, e.g. \"u dārad qazā mixorad\" 'he is eating at the moment'. There is no negative.\n\nThe past simple is formed with the infinitive stem and personal endings. There is no ending in the 3rd person singular:\n\nThe stress in this tense goes on the syllable before the ending, e.g. \"kárdam\", \"geréftam\" 'I took'. But in a compound verb, the stress goes on the word before the verb, e.g. on \"kār\" in \"kār kardam\" 'I worked'.\n\nThe negative is made with \"na-\" (stressed): \"man nákardam\" 'I didn't do (it)'.\n\nIn addition to its normal meaning of the simple past (e.g. 'he went'), the past simple also has some idiomatic uses in Persian. For example, colloquially it can be used in 'if' and 'when' clauses referring to future time:\n\nAnother idiom is \"āmadam!\" 'I'm coming (at once!)'\n\nThe past simple tense in Persian is also often used where English might use the perfect to refer to events which have just occurred:\n\nThe imperfect is formed by prefixing می \"mi-\" to the simple past:\n\n\nThe negative has \"ne-\": \"man nemikardam\" 'I was not doing'.\n\nThe imperfect of بودن \"budan\" 'to be' and داشتن \"dāštan\" 'to have' do not use the prefix می \"mi-\", except sometimes when the meaning is 'would be' or 'would have':\n\nThe negative of these is made with \"na-\": \"nabudam\" 'I was not'.\n\nAs well as its main past habitual or past progressive meaning ('I used to go', 'I was going'), the imperfect in Persian is also used in a conditional meaning ('I would go', 'I would have gone'), for example:\n\nIt can also be used in sentences expressing unfulfilled wishes concerning the present or the past:\n\nIn colloquial Persian the progressive aspect of the imperfect tense can be reinforced in its progressive meaning by adding the past tense of داشتن \"dāštan\" before it:\n\n\nWhen used in a sentence, the two parts of the verb are usually separated by other words, e.g. \n\nThere is no negative.\n\nThe pluperfect is a compound tense formed from the perfect participle and the simple past of the verb بودن (to be). As well as its ordinary use as a pluperfect, like the imperfect it can also be used in a conditional sense:\n\nThe negative is formed with \"na-\": \"man nakarde budam\" 'I hadn't done'.\n\nThe verb \"budan\" 'to be' is not used in the pluperfect tense, the simple past being used instead.\n\nSometimes a continuous version of the pluperfect is found (\"man mikarde budam\") but this is rare and not generally used; some Persian grammarians consider it ungrammatical.\n\nAs well as its ordinary pluperfect meaning ('he had gone'), the pluperfect can also be used instead of the imperfect in the sense 'would have gone' or 'if (only) he had gone':\n\nCorresponding to each of the past tenses, Persian has a set of perfect tenses. These tenses are not only used in the ordinary perfect sense ('he has done X', 'he has sometimes done X') but also in colloquial Persian in an inferential or reported sense ('it appears that he did X'), Most other Iranian dialects of the region have a similar use of the perfect tense and it is likely that this is due to areal contact with Turkish, which is also spoken in Iran.\n\nThe perfect simple is formed by adding the present-tense suffixes of the verb بودن \"budan\" ('to be') to the perfect participle:\n\n\nThe negative is made with \"na-\" (stressed): \"man nakarde am\" 'I have not done'.\n\nThe perfect tense is used in situations similar to those described for the perfect in English. One situation is the perfect of result:\n\nAnother is the experiential perfect, to describe an event that has happened before (and may happen again):\n\nAnother use of the perfect is to describe a situation that has lasted a long time up to now:\n\nUnlike the English perfect, the Persian perfect is compatible with a past-time adverbial. It is often used in sentences such as:\n\nAnother use which differs from English is in sentences of the type 'it is a long time since X happened':\n\nWith verbs meaning 'stand', 'sit', 'lie' the perfect can represent a present state:\n\nThe perfect continuous is made by adding the prefix \"mi-\" to the perfect:\n\nThe negative (which is rare) is made with \"ne-\": \"nemikarde am\" 'I have not been doing'.\n\nThis tense is not used in the same way in Persian as the English perfect continuous. As noted above, the present, not the perfect is used in sentences of the kind 'I have been waiting for an hour' (lit. 'it is an hour that I am waiting for you'). \n\nHowever, it can be used in sentences such as the following referring to events which have been happening repeatedly or continuously for a long time:\n\nAnother common use which differs from English is to express a situation that no longer exists, that is, it is the equivalent of 'I used to do':\n\nIt can also be used in an inferential sense, as in:\n\nA progressive version of the perfect continuous is also found in colloquial Persian, but it seems only in the 3rd person:\n\nIt is typically used in an inferential sense (that is, with the idea 'it would seem that...'), for example, in sentences in which the speaker is reporting something he has been told, but did not personally witness, such as the following:\n\nA perfect version of the pluperfect (also known as the 'double perfect') can be made by changing \"budam\" in the pluperfect to \"bude am\". This is occasionally used in a non-inferential sense, but much more frequently it is inferential:\n\nA typical example of its use is the following:\n\nThe future tense is formed by adding a shortened version of the infinitive, identical with the infinitive stem, to the verb خواهم \"xāham\" 'I want'. It is rarely used in colloquial Persian, since the present tense is usually used with a future meaning instead (especially with verbs of motion):\n\nThe positive verb is stressed on the personal ending: \"xāhám kard\". The negative is \"naxāham kard\" 'I will not do', with stress on \"ná-\".\n\nThere is no distinction between simple and continuous in the future. There is also no future perfect. To represent the future perfect (e.g. 'I will have finished') Persian uses either the future simple or colloquially the perfect simple:\n\nAnother way of expressing future in colloquial Persian is to use a form meaning literally 'he wants to do it' in the sense 'he is about to do it', for example:\n\nThere are also other expressions used for referring to the future, such as \"qarār ast\" 'it is arranged' or \"tasmim dāram\" 'I'm intending to', followed by the subjunctive:\n\nThe present tense is also frequently used with future reference, but especially of verbs of motion or arriving. A time adverbial is also required to avoid ambiguity:\n\nThe present subjunctive is formed from by prefixing بـ \"be-\" to the present stem with personal endings, e.g. \"benevisam\" 'I may write'. When the verb has the vowel \"o\" this changes to \"bo-\":\n\n\nWhen used as part of a compound verb, the prefix \"be-\" is sometimes omitted, e.g. چکار کنم \"če kār konam?\" 'what am I to do?'\n\nThe negative also lacks the prefix \"be-\": \"nakonam\" 'that I not do'.\n\nThe present subjunctive of the verb بودن 'to be' is باشم \"bāšam\", with the same endings as above. The present subjunctive of the verb داشتن 'to have' is usually replaced by the perfect subjunctive داشته باشم \"dāšte bāšam\".\n\nThe present subjunctive is very common in Persian. It is used whenever it is uncertain whether an event will take place, or whether a situation is true, e.g. \n\nIt is used for indefinite relative clauses such as the following:\n\nThe subjunctive is also used after phrases such as \"qabl az inke\" 'before...' (of future or past time), \"tā\" 'until...' (of future time only), \"tā\" 'so that':\n\nIt is also used instead of an infinitive after verbs such as 'I want', 'I can', 'I must', 'it is possible that', and in indirect commands:\n\nThe perfect subjunctive is formed by adding \"bāšam\" to the perfect participle. One of the main uses is in sentences referring to an event or state in the past about which there is an element of doubt:\n\nIt is also used for wishes:\n\nThe negative is made with \"na-\": \"nakarde bāšam\" 'that I have not done'.\n\nThe imperative (command) is similar to the subjunctive, except that the 2nd person singular has no ending:\n\nThe negative lacks the prefix \"be-\": \"nanevis!\" 'do not write!'.\n\nIf the present stem ends in \"-av\", as in \"rav\" 'go', this changes in the imperative singular to \"-o\":\n\nThe imperative of the verb \"dāštan\" 'to have' generally uses the perfect subjunctive form:\n\nAlthough it mostly appears in classical Persian literature, the optative mood is sometimes used in common Persian. It is formed by adding \"-ād\" to the present stem: \n\nAlthough in general, this inflection has been abandoned, yet remnants of its usage can be observed in colloquial expressions such as \"harče bādā bād\" (هرچه بادا باد) 'come what may' and \"dast marizād\" (دست مريزاد) lit. 'may that hand not spill [what it is holding]', meaning 'well done'.\n\nTransitive verbs in Persian can be made passive by adding different tenses of the verb \"šodan\" 'to become' to the perfect participle, e.g.\n\"nāme nevešte (na)šode ast\" 'the letter has (not) been written'\n\"nāme nevešte xāhad šod\" 'the letter will be written'\n\nIn the subjunctive, the prefix \"be-\" is usually omitted:\n\"nāme bāyad nevešte šavad\" 'the letter must be written'\n\nIn compound verbs, the light verb \"kardan\" is simply replaced with \"šodan\". For example, from \"čāp kardan\" 'to print' is made:\n\"āgahi diruz čāp šod\" 'the letter was printed yesterday'\n\nLike English verbs, Persian verbs are either transitive (requiring an object) or intransitive. In Persian an accusative marker (enclitic), را \"rā\", comes after any definite direct object:\n\nNote: If the direct object is indefinite, no را \"rā\" is needed. Example:\n\nAn intransitive verb can be turned into a transitive one by making it into a causative verb. This is done by adding \"-ān-\" (in the past tense \"-ānd-\") to the present stem of the verb. For example:\nThere are also cases where a causative verb is formed from a transitive verb:\n\nCausative verbs are not comprehensively productive, but are applied to certain verbs only.\n\nIn colloquial Persian, many of the most commonly used verbs are pronounced in an abbreviated form; and \"ān\" and \"ām\" many become \"un\" and \"um\". Here are some examples:\n\nMany verbs nowadays are compound verbs and many old simple verbs have been replaced by a compound. One of the most frequent verbs (known as light verbs) used to form compound verbs is کَردَن \"kardan\" 'to do, to make'. For example, the word صُحبَت \"sohbat\" (originally from Arabic) means 'conversation', while صُحبَت کَردَن \"sohbat kardan\" means 'to speak'. Only the light verb (e.g. کَردَن \"kardan\") is conjugated; the word preceding it is not affected. For example: \n\nSome other light verbs used to form compound verbs are: \n\nSome other examples of compound verbs with کَردَن \"kardan\" are:\n\n\nEquivalents for فِکر کَردَن \"fekr kardan\" and گَریه کَردَن \"gerye kardan\" are پنداشتن \"pendāštan\" and گریستن \"geristan\", which are normally used in a literary context rather than in daily conversation.\n\nThe following auxiliary verbs are used in Persian:\n\nIn indirect sentences introduced by a past-tense verb (e.g. 'he said that...', 'he asked whether...', 'it was obvious that...'), if the second verb refers to a situation simultaneous with, or an event shortly to follow, the main verb, the present tense is used in Persian. It does not change to a past tense as in English:\n\nIf the second verb refers to a time earlier than the second verb, it is common to use one of the perfect tenses for the second verb:\n\nHowever the pluperfect can be used if the fact is certain:\n\nIf the second verb merely represents an idea rather than a statement of fact, or a wish or a possibility, the subjunctive is used:\n\n"}

Readers will more likely be convinced to side with the writer’s position or agree with his or her opinion if it is backed up by verifiable evidence. \n\n2. Concrete, relevant, and reasonable examples can enhance the writer’s idea or opinion. They can be based on observations or from the writer’s personal experience. \n\n3. Accurate, current, and balanced information adds to the credibility of persuasive writing. The writer does not only present evidence that favor his or her ideas, but he or she also acknowledges some evidence that opposes his or her own. In the writing, though, his or her ideas would be sounder.\n\nEthos is the appeal to ethics. It convinces the audience of the credibility of the writer. The writer’s expertise on his or her subject matter lends to such credibility. The level of education and profession of the writer also come into play.\n\nLogos is the appeal to logic and reason. It is the most commonly accepted mode in persuasion because it aims to be scientific in its approach to argumentation. In writing, facts are presented in a logical manner, and faulty logic is avoided.\n\nPathos is the appeal to emotion. This aims to convince the audience by appealing to human emotions.

Power (re-) creates its own fields of exercise through knowledge.\n\nFoucault incorporates this inevitable mutuality into his neologism power-knowledge, the most important part of which is the hyphen that links the two aspects of the integrated concept together (and alludes to their inherent inextricability).\n\nIt is helpful noting that Foucault has a textual understanding of both power and knowledge. Both power and knowledge are to be seen as de-centralised, relativistic, ubiquitous, and unstable (dynamic) systemic phenomena. Thus Foucault's concept of power draws on micro-relations without falling into reductionism because it does not neglect, but emphasizes, the systemic (or structural) aspect of the phenomenon.\n\nHowever, he does not actually define knowledge.\n\nAccording to this understanding, knowledge is never neutral, as it determines force relations. The notion of power-knowledge is therefore likely to be employed in critical, normative contexts.\n\nIn his later works, Foucault suggests that power-knowledge was later replaced in the modern world, with the term governmentality which points to a specific mentality of governance.\n\n"}

He is a paternal first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, being a grandson of King George V and Queen Mary. He is currently 47th in the line of succession to the British throne, but at the time of his birth was seventh in the line of succession.\n\nPrince Michael occasionally represents the Queen at some functions in Commonwealth realms outside the United Kingdom. Otherwise, he manages his own consultancy business and undertakes various commercial work around the world. He has also presented some television documentaries on the royal families of Europe.\n\nPrince Michael was born during the Second World War on 4 July 1942, at Coppins, Iver, Buckinghamshire. He was the third child of Prince George, Duke of Kent, who was a son of King George V and Queen Mary and a younger brother of King George VI. At the time of his birth Michael was seventh in the line of Succession to the British throne. His mother was Princess Marina, a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia.\n\nAt his christening on 4 August 1942 in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle, his godparents were: his paternal uncle the King; the Queen of the Netherlands (for whom her son-in-law Prince Bernhard stood proxy); the King of Norway (his great-uncle); US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (for whom the Duke of Kent stood proxy); the Hereditary Princess of Greece (who was not present), the wife of Paul of Greece, his first cousin-once-removed; the Duke of Gloucester (his paternal uncle, who was absent); the Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven (his paternal first cousin twice-removed); and Lady Patricia Ramsay (his paternal first cousin twice-removed). Because of the war, newspaper reports did not identify the location of the christening and said instead that it took place at \"a private chapel in the country\". \n\nJust seven weeks after Michael's birth, his father was killed in a plane crash near Caithness, Scotland, on 25 August 1942.\n\nAt the age of five, Prince Michael was a page boy at the wedding of his cousins, Princess Elizabeth and Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten.\n\nHe was educated at Sunningdale School and Eton College. Besides being fluent in French and having a \"working knowledge\" of German and Italian, he was the first member of the royal family to learn Russian.\n\nPrince Michael entered the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, in January 1961, from where he was commissioned into the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own), in 1963, he later served in The Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales's Own) after the 1969 amalgamation between the 11th Hussars and the 10th Royal Hussars (Prince of Wales's Own). He saw service in Germany, Hong Kong, and Cyprus, where his squadron formed part of a United Nations peacekeeping force in 1971. Subsequent tours of duty, during a military career that spanned twenty years, included a number of appointments on the Defence Intelligence Staff. He retired from the Army with the rank of Major in 1981.\n\nIn 1994, Prince Michael was made Honorary Commodore (later Honorary Rear Admiral and currently Vice Admiral) of the Royal Naval Reserve, and in 2002 he was made Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Benson (promoted to Honorary Air Marshal in 2012). From 2009 to 2012 he was Regimental Colonel of the Honourable Artillery Company and has been, since 31 January 2012, Royal Honorary Colonel of that regiment. He is also Colonel-in-Chief of the Essex and Kent Scottish Regiment in Canada.\n\nAs the third child of George V's fourth son, it was not expected that Prince Michael, as the only second son in the extended royal family, would undertake many engagements on behalf of the royal family. He has performed official duties in the Commonwealth realms other than the United Kingdom and has represented the Queen abroad.\n\nHe has, however, never received a parliamentary annuity or an allowance from the British Privy Purse, unlike both his elder brother, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and his sister, Princess Alexandra, who both carry out official royal duties in the United Kingdom and receive British parliamentary annuities. The Prince was given a grace and favour apartment at Kensington Palace upon his marriage in 1978.\n\nPrince Michael has represented the Queen at state funerals in India, Cyprus and Swaziland and, with his wife, Princess Michael of Kent, represented the Queen at the independence celebrations in Belize, and at the Coronation of King Mswati III of Swaziland.\n\nPrince Michael supports a large number of charities and organisations. Some of his patronages and presidencies include: the Kennel Club, Children's Burns Trust, Maritime Volunteer Service, the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships, Life Saving Society, Royal Automobile Club, National Eye Research Centre, Motor Sports Association, Brooklands Museum Trust, and the Light Aircraft Association.\n\nOn 30 June 1978, Prince Michael was married, at a civil ceremony, at the Rathaus, Vienna, Austria, to Baroness Marie Christine von Reibnitz, the only daughter of the Silesian nobleman Baron Gunther Hubertus von Reibnitz and of his Austro-Hungarian wife, Maria Anna Carolina Franziska Walpurga Bernadette, Countess Szapáry de Muraszombath, Széchysziget et Szapár. After receiving Pope John Paul II's permission, the couple later received a blessing of their marriage in a Roman Catholic ceremony on 29 June 1983 at Archbishop's House, London.\n\nAt the time of the marriage, Marie Christine von Reibnitz was not only a Roman Catholic, but also a divorcée. She had previously been married to the banker Thomas Troubridge; they separated in 1973, divorced in 1977, and had their marriage annulled by the Roman Catholic Church a year later, two months before her marriage to Prince Michael. Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, Prince Michael forfeited his place in the line of succession to the throne through his marriage to a Roman Catholic.

He is also a qualified interpreter of Russian.\n\nPrince Michael is an active Freemason. He is the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons, and Provincial Grand Master of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Middlesex.\n\nPrince Michael speaks fluent Russian and has a strong interest in Russia, where he is a well-known figure (he is a recipient of the Order of Friendship). Tsar Nicholas II was a first cousin of three of his grandparents. When the bodies of the Tsar and some of his family were recovered in 1991, the remains were later identified by DNA using, among others, a sample from Prince Michael for recognition. He attended the 1998 burial of the Tsar and his family in St Petersburg. He is an Honorary Member of the Romanov Family Association. He is also the second cousin of Maria Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of Russia, who is a claimant to the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia. They share the same great-grandfather, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich. The Prince is the patron of organisations which has close ties with Russia, including the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce and the St Gregory's Foundation. In his capacity as patron of Children's Fire and Burns Trust, Michael has led fundraising rallies in 1999 and 2003 in Russia to raise money for the charity. He also led another rally in 2005 and raised money for the Royal Marsden Hospital and Britain's Charities Aid Foundation Russia.\n\nPrince Michael was a part of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst rowing team that won the Maiden Fours at Bedford in 1961. Prince Michael competed for Great Britain in the 1971 FIBT World Bobsleigh Championships but crashed and failed to finish the event. He was official non-travelling reserve for the 1972 Winter Olympics. He took part in the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally in an Austin Maxi, but he and his crew failed to finish the event.\n\nIn 2002, both Prince and Princess Michael of Kent were the subject of criticism over the rent paid on their accommodation at Kensington Palace following scrutiny by the House of Commons Public Accounts committee on the cost of royal palaces and whether they were value for money. The committee had called on the Queen to evict its residents and put the apartments on a more commercial footing. When it was claimed that the couple paid a rent of only £69 per week for the use of their apartments at Kensington Palace, Buckingham palace announced that \"The Queen is paying the rent for Prince and Princess Michael of Kent's apartment at a commercial rate of £120,000 annually, from her own private funds. This rent payment by The Queen is in recognition of the Royal engagements and work for various charities which Prince and Princess Michael of Kent have undertaken at their own expense, and without any public funding.\"\n\nPrince Michael has been under close scrutiny by the media for financial assistance given to him by Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. In May 2012, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that the Prince had received £320,000 during a six-year period from 2002 to 2008 into a family business owned by the prince's secretary, from a fund controlled by Berezovsky, in which 56 payments of between £5,000 and £15,000 were sent through offshore companies. In an interview with \"The Sunday Times\" Berezovsky stated, \"There is nothing underhand or improper about the financial assistance I have given Prince Michael. It is a matter between friends.\"\n\nAs a child of a younger son of a British sovereign, he is styled as a British prince with the prefix \"His Royal Highness\" and a territorial designation deriving from his father's dukedom: \"His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Kent\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a Syrian who was brought as a slave to Italy, but by his wit and talent he won the favour of his master, who freed and educated him. Publilius' name, due to early medieval palatalization of 'l' between two 'i's, is often presented by manuscripts (and some printed editions) in corrupt form as 'Publius'.\n\nHis mimes, in which he acted, had a great success in the provincial towns of Italy and at the games given by Caesar in 46 BC. Publilius was perhaps even more famous as an improviser, and received from Caesar himself the prize in a contest in which he vanquished all his competitors, including the celebrated Decimus Laberius.\n\nAll that remains of his corpus is a collection of \"Sententiae\", a series of moral maxims in iambic and trochaic verse. This collection must have been made at a very early date, since it was known to Aulus Gellius in the 2nd century AD. Each maxim consists of a single verse, and the verses are arranged in alphabetical order according to their initial letters. In the course of time the collection was interpolated with sentences drawn from other writers, especially from apocryphal writings of Seneca the Younger. The number of genuine verses is about 700. They include many pithy sayings, such as the famous \"iudex damnatur ubi nocens absolvitur\" (\"The judge is condemned when the guilty is acquitted\") adopted as its motto by the \"Edinburgh Review\".\n\nAs of 1911, the best texts of the \"Sentences\" were those of Eduard Wölfflin (1869), A. Spengel (1874), and Wilhelm Meyer (1880), with complete critical apparatus and \"index verborum\"; editions with notes by O. Friedrich (1880), R. A. H. Bickford-Smith (1895), with full bibliography; see also W. Meyer, \"Die Sammlungen der Spruchverse des Publilius Syrus\" (1877), an important work.\n\nSeneca the Younger strived to develop a \"sententious style\" like Publilius throughout his life. He quotes Syrus in his\" Moral Epistles to Lucilius\" in the eighth moral letter, \"On the Philosopher's Seclusion\" and the ninety-fourth, \"On the Value of Advice\".\n\nWilliam Shakespeare in the first scene of the fifth act of \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" has Don Pedro proverbially say: \"if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly.\" W.L. Rushton argues that this is derived from John Lyly's \"Euphues\". If Shakespeare had not taken this from Lyly, then he and Lyly both derived this expression from Publilius.\n\nThe Muddy Waters song Rollin' Stone was named after the proverb and the Rolling Stones band was named after the Muddy Waters song.\n\n\n"}

Various species of insects have been known to utilize molecular compounds from plants for their own defense and even as their pheromones or precursors to their pheromones. A few Lepidoptera have been found to sequester chemicals from plants which they retain throughout their life and some members of Erebidae are examples of this phenomenon. Starting in the mid-twentieth century researchers investigated various members of Arctiidae, and how these insects sequester pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) during their life stages, and utilize these chemicals as adults for pheromones or pheromone precursors. PAs are also used by members of the Arctiidae for defense against predators throughout the life of the insect.\n\nPyrrolizidine alkaloids are a group of chemicals produced by plants as secondary metabolites, all of which contain a pyrrolizidine nucleus. This nucleus is made up of two pyrrole rings bonded by one carbon and one nitrogen. There are two forms in which PAs can exist and will readily interchange between: a pro-toxic free base form, also called a tertiary amine, or in a non-toxic form of N-oxide.\n\nResearchers have collected data that strongly suggests that PAs can be registered by taste receptors of predators, acting as a deterrent from being ingested. Taste receptors are also used by the various moth species that sequester PAs, which often stimulates them to feed. As of 2005, all of the PA sequestering insects that have been studied have all evolved a system to keep concentrations of the PA pro-toxic form low within the insect’s tissues.\n\nResearchers have found a number of Arctiidae that utilize PAs for protection and for male pheromones or precursors of the male pheromones, and some studies have found evidence suggesting PAs have behavioral and developmental effects. \"Estigmene acrea\", \"Cosmosoma myrodora\", \"Utetheisa ornatrix\", \"Creatonotos gangis\" and \"Creatonotos transiens\" are all members of the family Arctiidae and found to use PAs for their defense and/or male pheromones. Parsimony suggests that the sequestering of PAs in the larval stage evolved in the subfamily Arctiinae common ancestor. The loss of ability to sequester and utilize PAs has occurred in a number of species, along with the switch from larval uptake to adult uptake of PAs occurring multiple times within the Arctiinae taxon.\nMembers of Arctiidae typically sequester PAs from their diets, but sometimes must specifically ingest fluids excreted by plants that are not a part of their diets. Sequestered PAs are kept in various tissues and varying concentration which is dependent upon the species. PAs are found in the cuticle of all studied Arctiidae mentioned here, but some also package these chemicals into their spermatophores as seen in \"Creatonotos gangis\" and \"Creatonotos transiens\". The display of PAs on the exoskeleton is believed to cue predators to the unpalatability of the prey.\n\nEisner and Eisner looked at the palatability of PA positive and negative \"U. ornatrix\" to wolf spiders, \"Lycosa ceratiola\", in both the larval form and adult form. They found that the pyrrolizidine-positive organisms were typically released unharmed by spiders except in two field circumstances where the larvae were probably envenomated prior to the spider’s release and died two days after the attack. All of the PA-negative organisms were eaten by spiders. These findings were in line with prior studies done by Eisner and Meinwald which looked at orb weavers and \"U. ornatrix\", along with spiders being fed beetle larva covered in PAs, which they rejected. All of these findings support PAs being utilized for defense against predation.\n\nStudies have further elucidated the defenses and uses of PAs in Arctiidae. One study researched \"C. myrodora\" and how PAs protect this species from spider predation among other things. It found that PAs ingested from fluids excreted by plants aided in defense from predation. All organisms permitted access to PA-containing diets that were fed to spiders were cut loose from the webs. Females that had PA-deprived diets, but were allowed to mate with PA-positive males, were also released from the spider’s webs. Further observations showed that male \"C. myrodora\" have a pair of pouches where they produce PA-laden filaments, which are typically released over the female prior to copulation as a nuptial gift. Experiments show that the filaments give the females more PAs, explaining why spiders released mated PA-negative females from their webs. Most of the PAs from the males were subsequently transferred to the eggs when deposited. Three clusters of eggs that were laid after copulation with a PA-positive male all tested positive for alkaloids and the one cluster that resulted from a PA-negative male copulation tested negative. By the eggs getting a dose of PAs, the authors suggest that the eggs are being protected from predators such as Coccinellidae beetles.\n\nJordan and others’ study found a very interesting effect of the larval ingestion of PAs. Male \"Estigmene acrea\" moths that consumed PAs in their diet as larvae produced hydroxydanaidal, a volatile PA compound, and displayed their coremata: a bifid, inflatable male-specific organ, utilized in dispersing pheromones in the adult stage. Larvae that were fed diets without PAs rarely displayed their coremata and did not produce hydroxydanaidal. E. acrea have been observed in the wild displaying their coremata, an activity which attracts both males and females and is known as \"lekking\". Lekking was described by Willis and Birch in 1982, but larvae raised in the laboratory prior to this study rarely engaged in lekking or corematal displays. Scientists were unsure of why this phenomenon didn’t occur in the lab, but laboratory raised larvae were usually reared on commercially available food which lacks PAs. The authors suggest that the PAs are used by the males to attract other moths by releasing the volatile PA hydroxydanaidal into the air. It is suggested in this study that this strategy of mate attraction came about by tapping into the PA affinity already programmed into the moths for feeding, which is further supported by the observation that E. acrea females release their pheromones a little bit later in the evening than the males.\nSimilar uses of coremata to attract other moths have been observed in \"C. gangis\" and \"C. transiens\" along with altered development of coremata when larvae are reared without PAs. Boppre and Schneider observed adult males of these two species that were not permitted to eat PAs. Their coremata only developed into two, stalk-like projections with very few hairs arising from these stalks. Males that were given plants that produced PAs to feed upon, developed long coremata with four tubes, each longer than the males body, and each tube was highly pubescent. The authors suggest from this observation that there is a basic corematal phenotype, the two stalked coremata, and that PAs are required to form full coremata which is much larger and more elaborate than the basic corematal expression. These observations were further investigated by feeding larvae different amounts of PAs which had a direct correlation to the development of the coremata, which reached a maximum plateau around 2 mg of PAs ingested while in larval form. Similar to Jordan and others’ findings, the males raised on a diet devoid of PAs did not produce hydroxydanaidal.\n"}

(This language is often referred to in the literature as \"Tolai\". However, Tolai is actually the name of the cultural group. The Tolais themselves refer to their language as \"a tinata tuna\", which translates as \"the real language\". \"Kuanua\" is apparently a word in Ramoaaina meaning \"the place over there\".)\n\nUnlike many languages in Papua New Guinea, Tolai is a healthy language and not in danger of dying out to Tok Pisin, although even Tolai suffers from a surfeit of loanwords from Tok Pisin, e.g. the original \"kubar\" has been completely usurped by the Tok Pisin \"braun\" for brown or the Tok Pisin \"vilivil\" for bicycle has replaced the former \"aingau\". It is considered a prestigious language and is the primary language of communication in the two major centers of East New Britain: Kokopo and Rabaul.\n\nTolai lost the phoneme /s/. For instance, the word for 'sun' in closely related languages of South New Ireland is \"kesakese\", and this has been reduced to \"keake\" in Tolai. However, /s/ has been reintroduced through numerous loanwords from English and Tok Pisin.\n\nTolai belongs to the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian language family. The most immediate subgroup is the Patpatar–Tolai group of languages which also includes Lungalunga (also spoken on the Gazelle Peninsula) and Patpatar (spoken on New Ireland).\n\nTolai is spoken on the Gazelle Peninsula in the East New Britain Province of Papua New Guinea.\n\nTolai is said to be one of the major substratum languages of Tok Pisin. Some common Tok Pisin vocabulary items that likely come from Tolai (or a closely related language) include:\n\n\"aibika\" (from \"ibika\") - Hibiscus manihot<br>\n\"buai\" - betelnut<br>\n\"diwai\" (from \"dawai\") - tree, wood<br>\n\"guria\" - earthquake<br>\n\"kawawar\" (from \"kavavar\") - ginger<br>\n\"kiau\" - egg<br>\n\"lapun\" - elderly person<br>\n\"liklik\" (from \"ikilik\") - small<br>\n\"umben\" (from \"uben\") - fishing net\n\nPhonology of the Tolai language:\n\nVowel sounds can also be realised as [ɪ, ɛ, ʌ, ɔ, ʊ].\n\nTolai pronouns have four number distinctions (singular, dual, trial and plural) and three person distinctions (first person, second person and third person) as well as an inclusive/exclusive distinction. There are no gender distinctions.\n\nThe plural pronouns lose their final -t when used before a verb. 'Da vana!' - 'Let's go!', 'Pa ave gire.' - 'We didn't see.', 'Dia tar pot' - 'They have already arrived.'\n\nThe usual word order of Tolai is SVO.\n\nThere is an irregular pattern involving the prefix ni-, which changes a verb to a noun. Ordinarily, the prefix is added to the verb, as in \"laun\" \"to live\" → \"a nilaun\" \"the life\", \"ian\" \"to eat\" → \"a nian\" \"the food\", \"aring\" \"to pray\" → \"a niaring\" \"the prayer\". However, in some cases it becomes an infix : \"varubu\" \"to fight\" → \"a vinarubu\" \"the fight\", \"tata\" \"to talk\" → \"a tinata\" \"the language\", \"mamai\" \"to chew betelnut\" → \"a minamai\" \"(a small supply of) betelnuts for chewing\". This infix is inserted after the initial phoneme of the verb. It could also be described as the prefix ni- being added as a prefix, and the initial phoneme of the verb changing places with the \"n\" of the prefix.\n\n\n"}

It is an alternative to the rotary table and kelly drive. It is located at the swivel's place below the traveling block and moves vertically up and down the derrick. \n\nThe top drive allows the drilling rig to drill the longer section of a stand of drill pipe in one operation. A rotary table type rig can only drill (single drill pipe) sections of drill pipe whereas a top drive can drill stands (double and triple drill pipe respectively, a triple being three joints of drillpipe screwed together), depending on the drilling rig size. Handling longer sections of drill pipe enables a drilling rig to make greater daily progress because up to can be drilled at a time, thus requiring fewer \"connections\" to add another of drill pipe. Another advantage of top drive systems is time efficiency. When the bit progresses under a kelly drive, the entire string must be withdrawn from the well bore for the length of the kelly in order to add one more length of drill pipe. With a top drive, the draw works only has to pick up a new stand from the rack and make up two joints. Making fewer and quicker connections reduces the risk of a stuck string from annulus clogging while drilling fluid is not being pumped. \n\nSeveral different kinds of top drives exist, and are usually classified based on the \"Safe Working Load\" (SWL) of the equipment and the size and type of motor used to rotate the drillpipe. For offshore and heavy duty use, a 1000 short ton unit would be used, whereas a smaller land rig may only require a 500 short ton device.

{"id": "30461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30461", "title": "Transfinite induction", "text": "Transfinite induction\n\nTransfinite induction is an extension of mathematical induction to well-ordered sets, for example to sets of ordinal numbers or cardinal numbers.\n\nLet P(α) be a property defined for all ordinals α. Suppose that whenever P(β) is true for all β < α, then P(α) is also true. Then transfinite induction tells us that P is true for all ordinals.\n\nUsually the proof is broken down into three cases:\n\n\nAll three cases are identical except for the type of ordinal considered. They do not formally need to be considered separately, but in practice the proofs are typically so different as to require separate presentations. Zero is sometimes considered a limit ordinal and then may sometimes be treated in proofs in the same case as limit ordinals.\n\nTransfinite recursion is similar to transfinite induction; however, instead of proving that something holds for all ordinal numbers, we construct a sequence of objects, one for each ordinal.\n\nAs an example, a basis for a (possibly infinite-dimensional) vector space can be created by choosing a vector formula_1 and for each ordinal α choosing a vector that is not in the span of the vectors formula_2. This process stops when no vector can be chosen.\n\nMore formally, we can state the Transfinite Recursion Theorem as follows:\n\n\nAs in the case of induction, we may treat different types of ordinals separately: another formulation of transfinite recursion is the following:\n\n\nNote that we require the domains of \"G\", \"G\" to be broad enough to make the above properties meaningful. The uniqueness of the sequence satisfying these properties can be proved using transfinite induction.\n\nMore generally, one can define objects by transfinite recursion on any well-founded relation \"R\". (\"R\" need not even be a set; it can be a proper class, provided it is a set-like relation; that is, for any \"x\", the collection of all \"y\" such that \"y R x\" must be a set.)\n\nProofs or constructions using induction and recursion often use the axiom of choice to produce a well-ordered relation that can be treated by transfinite induction. However, if the relation in question is already well-ordered, one can often use transfinite induction without invoking the axiom of choice. For example, many results about Borel sets are proved by transfinite induction on the ordinal rank of the set; these ranks are already well-ordered, so the axiom of choice is not needed to well-order them.\n\nThe following construction of the Vitali set shows one way that the axiom of choice can be used in a proof by transfinite induction:\nThe above argument uses the axiom of choice in an essential way at the very beginning, in order to well-order the reals. After that step, the axiom of choice is not used again.\n\nOther uses of the axiom of choice are more subtle. For example, a construction by transfinite recursion frequently will not specify a \"unique\" value for \"A\", given the sequence up to α, but will specify only a \"condition\" that \"A\" must satisfy, and argue that there is at least one set satisfying this condition. If it is not possible to define a unique example of such a set at each stage, then it may be necessary to invoke (some form of) the axiom of choice to select one such at each step. For inductions and recursions of countable length, the weaker axiom of dependent choice is sufficient. Because there are models of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory of interest to set theorists that satisfy the axiom of dependent choice but not the full axiom of choice, the knowledge that a particular proof only requires dependent choice can be useful.\n\n"}

He honors Levinas for his ethical philosophy of openness to the Other. Indeed, he goes along with the idea that to live for the Other is the highest good. But he challenges the idea that only face-to-face interaction can be ethical. Whereas Levinas sees written communication as dead and unresponsive, Derrida argues that writing can be just as valuable a space for ethical encounter. He writes, in characteristic support for writing: \"Is it not possible to invert all of Levinas’s statements on this point? By showing, for example, that writing can assist itself, for it has time and freedom, escaping better than speech from empirical urgencies.\"\n\nIncluded in the collection is his 1966 lecture at Johns Hopkins University, which changed the course of the conference leading it to be renamed \"The Structuralist Controversy\", and caused Derrida to receive his first major attention outside France. The lecture is titled \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences\".\n"}
