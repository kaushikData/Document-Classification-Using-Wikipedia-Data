{"id": "82044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82044", "title": "Alsatian dialect", "text": "Alsatian dialect\n\nAlsatian (Alsatian and (\"Alsatian German\"); \"Frankish\": \"Elsässerdeitsch\"; ; or \"\") is a Low Alemannic German dialect spoken in most of Alsace, a formerly disputed region in eastern France that has passed between French and German control five times since 1681. A dialect of Alsatian German is spoken in the United States by the so-called Swiss Amish, whose ancestors emigrated there in the middle of the 19th century. The approximately 7,000 speakers are located mainly in Allen County, Indiana, with \"daughter settlements\" elsewhere.\n\nAlsatian is closely related to other nearby Alemannic dialects, such as Swiss German, Swabian, and Markgräflerisch as well as Kaiserstühlerisch. It is often confused with Lorraine Franconian, a more distantly related Franconian dialect spoken in the northwest corner of Alsace and in neighbouring Lorraine. Like other dialects and languages, Alsatian has also been influenced by outside sources. Words of Yiddish origin can be found in Alsatian, and modern conversational Alsatian includes adaptations of French words and English words, especially concerning new technologies.\n\nMany speakers of Alsatian could, if necessary, write in reasonable standard German. For most this would be rare and confined to those who have learned German at school or through work. As with other dialects, various factors determine when, where, and with whom one might converse in Alsatian. Some dialect speakers are unwilling to speak standard German, at times, to certain outsiders and prefer to use French. In contrast, many people living near the border with Basel, Switzerland, will speak their dialect with a Swiss person from that area, as they are mutually intelligible for the most part; similar habits may apply to conversations with people of the nearby German Markgräflerland. Some street names in Alsace may use Alsatian spellings (they were formerly displayed only in French but are now bilingual in some places, especially Strasbourg and Mulhouse).\n\n\"C\", \"Q\", and \"X\" are only used in loanwords. Y is also used in native words such as \"Dytschi\" (\"German\"), but is more common in loanwords.\n\nAlsatian has a set of 19 consonants:\n\nThree consonants are restricted in their distribution: and only occur at the beginning of a word or morpheme, and then only if followed immediately by a vowel; never occurs at the beginning of a word or morpheme.\n\nAlsatian, like some German dialects, has lenited all obstruents but . Its lenes are, however, voiceless as in all Southern German varieties. Therefore, they are here transcribed , , .\n\nThe phoneme has a velar allophone after back vowels (, , , and in those speakers who do not pronounce this as ), and palatal elsewhere. In southern dialects, there is a tendency to pronounce it in all positions, and in Strasbourg the palatal allophone tends to conflate with the phoneme .\n\nShort vowels: ( in Strasbourg), .\n\nLong vowels: \n\nSince 1992, the constitution of the Fifth Republic states that French is the official language of the Republic. However, Alsatian, along with other regional languages, is recognized by the French government in the official list of languages of France. France is a signatory to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages but has never ratified the law and has not given regional languages the support that would be required by the charter. The policies of the Paris government have had the deliberate effect of greatly weakening the prevalence of native languages in France that are not \"French.\" As a result, the Alsatian dialect of German has gone from being the prevalent language of the region to one in decline. A 1999 INSEE survey counted 548,000 adult speakers of Alsatian in France, making it the second most-spoken regional language in the country (after Occitan). Like all regional languages in France, however, the transmission of Alsatian is on the decline. While 43% of the adult population of Alsace speaks Alsatian, its use has been largely declining amongst the youngest generations.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is best known for several children's book series, featuring Pippi Longstocking, Emil i Lönneberga, Karlsson-on-the-Roof, and the Six Bullerby Children (\"Children of Noisy Village\" in the US), and for the children's fantasy novels \"Mio, My Son\", \"Ronia the Robber's Daughter\", and \"The Brothers Lionheart\". In January 2017, she was calculated to be the world's 18th most translated author, and the fourth most translated children's writer after Enid Blyton, H. C. Andersen and the Brothers Grimm. Lindgren has so far sold roughly 165 million books worldwide.\n\nAstrid Lindgren grew up in Näs, near Vimmerby, Småland, Sweden, and many of her books are based on her family and childhood memories and landscapes.\n\nLindgren was the daughter of Samuel August Ericsson (1875–1969) and Hanna Jonsson (1879–1961). She had two sisters, and , and a brother, , who eventually became a member of the Swedish parliament.\n\nUpon finishing school, Lindgren took a job with a local newspaper in Vimmerby. She had a relationship with the chief editor, who was married and a father, and who eventually proposed marriage in 1926 after she became pregnant. She declined and moved to the capital city of Stockholm, learning to become a typist and stenographer (she would later write most of her drafts in stenography). In due time, she gave birth to her son, Lars, in Copenhagen and left him in the care of a foster family.\n\nAlthough poorly paid, she saved whatever she could and traveled as often as possible to Copenhagen to be with Lars, often just over a weekend, spending most of her time on the train back and forth. Eventually, she managed to bring Lars home, leaving him in the care of her parents until she could afford to raise him in Stockholm.\n\nIn 1932 she married her employer, Sture Lindgren (1898–1952), who left his wife for her. Three years later, in 1934, Lindgren gave birth to her second child, Karin, who would become a translator. The character Pippi Longstocking was invented for her daughter to amuse her while she was ill in bed. Lindgren later related that Karin had suddenly said to her, \"Tell me a story about Pippi Longstocking,\" and the tale was created in response to that request.\n\nThe family moved in 1941 to an apartment on , with a view over Vasaparken, where Lindgren remained until her death on 28 January 2002 at the age of 94, having become blind.\n\nAstrid Lindgren died in her home in central Stockholm. Her funeral took place in the Storkyrkan (Great Church) in Gamla stan. Among those attending were King Carl XVI Gustaf with Queen Silvia and others of the royal family, and Prime Minister Göran Persson. The ceremony was described as \"the closest you can get to a state funeral.\"\n\nLindgren worked as a journalist and secretary before becoming a full-time author. She served as a secretary for the 1933 Swedish Summer Grand Prix.\n\nIn 1944 Lindgren won second prize in a competition held by Rabén & Sjögren, a new publishing house, with the novel \"Britt-Marie lättar sitt hjärta\" (\"Britt-Marie Unburdens Her Heart\"). A year later she won first prize in the same competition with the chapter book \"Pippi Långstrump\" (\"Pippi Longstocking\"), which had been rejected by Bonniers. (Rabén & Sjögren published it with illustrations by Ingrid Vang Nyman, the latter's debut in Sweden.) Since then it has become one of the most beloved children's books in the world and has been translated into 60 languages. While Lindgren almost immediately became a much appreciated writer, the irreverent attitude towards adult authority that is a distinguishing characteristic of many of her characters has occasionally drawn the ire of some conservatives.\n\nThe women's magazine \"Damernas Värld\" sent Lindgren to the United States in 1948 to write short essays. Upon arrival she is said to have been upset by the discrimination against black Americans. A few years later she published the book \"Kati in America\", a collection of short essays inspired by the trip.\n\nIn 1956, the inaugural year of the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis, the German-language edition of \"Mio, min Mio\" (\"Mio, My Son\") won the Children's book award. (Sixteen books written by Astrid Lindgren made the Children's Book and Picture Book longlist, 1956–1975, but only \"Mio, My Son\" won a prize in its category.)\n\nIn 1958 Lindgren received the second Hans Christian Andersen Medal for \"Rasmus på luffen\" (\"Rasmus and the Vagabond\"), a 1956 novel developed from her screenplay and filmed in 1955. The biennial International Board on Books for Young People, now considered the highest lifetime recognition available to creators of children's books, soon came to be called the Little Nobel Prize. Prior to 1962 the Board cited a single book published during the preceding two years.\n\nOn her 90th birthday, she was pronounced International Swede of the Year 1997 by Swedes in the World (SVIV), an association for Swedes living abroad.\n\nIn its entry on Scandinavian fantasy, \"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\" named Lindgren the foremost Swedish contributor to modern children's fantasy. Its entry on Lindgren summed up her work in glowing terms: \"Her niche in children's fantasy remains both secure and exalted. Her stories and images can never be forgotten.\"\n\nBy 2012 Astrid Lindgren's books had been translated into 95 different languages and language variants. Further, the first chapter of \"Ronja the Robber's Daughter\" has been translated into Latin. Up until 1997 a total of 3,000 editions of her books had been issued internationally, and globally her books had sold a total of 150 million copies. Many of her books have been translated into English by the translator Joan Tate.\n\nIn 1976 a scandal arose in Sweden when it was publicised that Lindgren's marginal tax rate had risen to 102 percent. This was to be known as the \"Pomperipossa effect\", from a story she published in \"Expressen on 3 March 1976,\" entitled \"Pomperipossa in Monismania\", attacking the government and its taxation policies. It was a satirical allegory in response to the marginal tax rate Lindgren had incurred in 1976, which required self-employed individuals to pay both regular income tax and employers' deductions. In a stormy tax debate, she attracted criticism from Social Democrats and even from her own colleagues, and responded by raising the issue of the lack of women involved in the Social Democrats' campaign. In that year's general election, the Social Democratic government was voted out for the first time in 44 years, and the Lindgren tax debate was one of several controversies that may have contributed to the result. Another controversy involved Ingmar Bergman's farewell letter to Sweden, after charges had been made against him of tax evasion. Lindgren nevertheless remained a Social Democrat for the rest of her life. \n\nLindgren was well known both for her support for children's and animal rights and for her opposition to corporal punishment. In 1994 she received the Right Livelihood Award, \"For her commitment to justice, non-violence and understanding of minorities as well as her love and caring for nature.\"\n\nIn 1967 the publisher Rabén & Sjögren established an annual literary prize, the Astrid Lindgren Prize, to mark her 60th birthday. The prize, 40,000 Swedish kronor, is awarded to a Swedish-language children's writer every year on Lindgren's birthday in November.\n\nFollowing Lindgren's death, the government of Sweden instituted the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award in her memory. The award is the world's largest monetary award for children's and youth literature, in the amount of five million Swedish kronor.\n\nThe collection of Astrid Lindgren's original manuscripts in Kungliga Biblioteket in Stockholm (the Royal Library) was placed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2005.\n\nOn 6 April 2011 Sweden's central bank Sveriges Riksbank announced that Lindgren's portrait will feature on the 20 kronor banknote, beginning in 2014–15. In the run-up to the announcement of the persons who would feature on the new banknotes, Lindgren's name had been the one most often put forward in the public debate.\n\nAsteroid 3204 Lindgren, discovered in 1978 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Chernykh, was named after her. The name of the Swedish microsatellite Astrid 1, launched on 24 January 1995, was originally selected only as a common Swedish female name, but within a short time it was decided to name the instruments after characters in Astrid Lindgren's books: PIPPI (Prelude in Planetary Particle Imaging), EMIL (Electron Measurements – In-situ and Lightweight), and MIO (Miniature Imaging Optics).\n\nIn memory of Astrid Lindgren, a memorial sculpture was created next to her childhood home, named \"Källa Astrid\" (\"Astrid's Wellspring\" in English). It is situated at the spot where Astrid Lindgren first heard fairy tales. The sculpture consists of an artistic representation of a young person's head (1.37 m high), flattened on top, in the corner of a square pond, and, just above the water, a ring of rosehip thorn (with a single rosehip bud attached to it). The sculpture was initially slightly different in design and intended to be part of a fountain set in the city center, but the people of Vimmerby vehemently opposed the idea. Furthermore, Astrid Lindgren had stated that she never wanted to be represented as a statue. (However, there is a statue of Lindgren in the city center.) The memorial was sponsored by the culture council of Vimmerby.\n\nLindgren's childhood home is near the statue and open to the public. Just from Astrid's Wellspring is a museum in her memory. The author is buried in Vimmerby where the Astrid Lindgren's World theme park is also located. The children's museum Junibacken, in Stockholm, was opened in June 1996 with the main theme of the permanent exhibition being devoted to Astrid Lindgren; at the heart of the museum is a theme train ride through the world of Astrid Lindgren's novels.\n\n\nThis is a chronological list of feature films based on stories by Astrid Lindgren. There are live action films as well as animated features. The most films were made in Sweden, followed by Russia. Some are international coproductions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the author of the Book of Sirach, also known as the Book of Ecclesiasticus. \n\nHe wrote his work in Hebrew, possibly in Alexandria, Egypt ca. 180–175 BCE, where he is thought to have established a school.\n\nSome commentators claim Ben Sira was a contemporary of Simon the Just (Shim`on HaTzadik), although it is more likely that his contemporary was High Priest Simon II (219–199 BCE).\n\nA medieval text, the Alphabet of Sirach, has been attributed to Ben Sira.\n\nIn the Greek text of the Book of Sirach, the author's father is called \"Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem\". Jesus is the Anglicized form of the Greek name Ἰησοῦς, the equivalent of the Aramaic borrowed from Late Biblical Hebrew \"Yeshua`\", derived from the older Masoretic Hebrew \"Yehoshua`\".\n\nThe copy owned by Saadia Gaon, the prominent rabbi, Jewish philosopher, and exegete of the 10th century CE, had the reading \"Shim`on, son of Yeshua`, son of El`azar ben Sira\"; and a similar reading occurs in the Hebrew manuscript B.\n\n\"Sirach\" is the Greek form of the family name Sira. It adds the letter Chi, an addition like that in Hakel-dama-ch in Acts 1:19.\n\nAccording to the Greek version, though not according to the Syriac, the author traveled extensively (xxxiv. 11) and was frequently in danger of death (ib. verse 12). In the hymn of chapter li, he speaks of the perils of all sorts from which God had delivered him, although this is probably only a poetic theme in imitation of the Psalms. The calumnies to which he was exposed in the presence of a certain king, supposed to be one of the Ptolemaic dynasty, are mentioned only in the Greek version, being ignored both in the Syriac and in the Hebrew text. The only fact known with certainty, drawn from the text itself, is that Ben Sira was a scholar, and a scribe thoroughly versed in the Law, and especially in the \"Books of Wisdom.\"\n\nVery little is known about his grandson, who claims in the text to be the translator of Sirach into Greek. He probably did the translation many years later after the original was written.\n\nThe Prologue in the Greek text, attributed to him, is generally considered the earliest witness to a canon of the books of the prophets.\n\nThe grandson states that he came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Euergetes. Ptolemy VIII Euergetes must be intended; he ascended the throne in the year 170 BCE, together with his brother Philometor, but he soon became sole ruler of Cyrene, and from 146 to 117 BCE held sway over all Egypt. He dated his reign from the year in which he received the crown (i.e., from 170 BCE). The translator must therefore have gone to Egypt in 132 BCE.\n\n\n"}

Breakout boxes span a wide spectrum of functionality: (i) some serve to break out every signal connection coming into a unit while others breakout only specific signals commonly monitored for either testing or troubleshooting purposes; and some are used on electrical connectors and others are used on optical fiber connectors.\n\nA breakout box serves as a troubleshooting tool to determine the wiring of an electrical connector interface on a networking device or computer. Typically, a breakout box is inserted between two electrical devices to determine which signal or power interconnects are active. Breakout boxes are extremely useful in troubleshooting connection problems resulting from manufacturing errors (e.g., miswiring) or defective interconnects resulting from broken wiring. Breakout boxes are specific examples of a more general category of network testing equipment called \"status monitors\".\n\nA variety of these monitoring devices are available for testing serial interfaces, including RS-232, RS-449, V.35, and X.21, as well as specialty interfaces. They generally come with a variety of connectors and are quick and easy to use for isolating problems with serial transmission connections in networking, telecommunications, and industrial settings.\n\nThe term \"breakout box\" is derived from the mechanical enclosure in which a connector's aggregate connections are separated (i.e., broken out) into individual signal or current carrying wires or cables.

{"id": "161296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161296", "title": "Colony (biology)", "text": "Colony (biology)\n\nIn biology, a colony is composed of two or more conspecific individuals living in close association with, or connected to, one another. This association is usually for mutual benefit such as stronger defense or the ability to attack bigger prey. It is a cluster of identical cells (clones) on the surface of (or within) a solid medium, usually derived from a single parent cell, as in bacterial colony. In contrast, a solitary organism is one in which all individuals live independently and have all of the functions needed to survive and reproduce.\n\nColonies, in the context of development, may be composed of two or more unitary (or solitary) organisms or be modular organisms. Unitary organisms have determinate development (set life stages) from zygote to adult form and individuals or groups of individuals (colonies) are visually distinct. Modular organisms have indeterminate growth forms (life stages not set) through repeated iteration of genetically identical modules (or individuals), and it can be difficult to distinguish between the colony as a whole and the modules within. In the latter case, modules may have specific functions within the colony.\n\nSome organisms are primarily independent and form facultative colonies in reply to environmental conditions while others must live in a colony to survive (obligate). For example, some carpenter bees will form colonies when a dominant hierarchy is formed between two or more nest foundresses (facultative colony), while corals are animals that are physically connected by living tissue (the coenosarc) that contains a shared gastrovascular cavity.\n\nUnicellular and multicellular unitary organisms may aggregate to form colonies. For example,\n\nModular organisms are those in which a genet (or genetic individual formed from a sexually-produced zygote) asexually reproduces to form genetically identical clones called ramets.\n\nA clonal colony is when the ramets of a genet live in close proximity or are physically connected. Ramets may have all of the functions needed to survive on their own or be interdependent on other ramets. For example, some sea anemones go through the process of pedal laceration in which a genetically identical individual is asexually produced from tissue broken off from the anemone's pedal disc. In plants, clonal colonies are created through the propagation of genetically identical trees by stolons or rhizomes.\n\nColonial organisms are clonal colonies composed of many physically connected, interdependent individuals. Colonial organisms can be unicellular, as in the alga \"Volvox\" (a coenobium), or multicellular, as in the phylum Bryozoa. The former type may have been the first step toward multicellular organisms. Individuals within a multicellular colonial organism may be called ramets, modules, or zooids. Structural and functional variation (polymorphism), when present, designates ramet responsibilities such as feeding, reproduction, and defense. To that end, being physically connected allows the colonial organism to distribute nutrients and energy obtained by feeding zooids throughout the colony. An example of colonial organisms that is well known are hydrozoans, like Portuguese man o' wars.\n\nA microbial colony is defined as a visible cluster of microorganisms growing on the surface of or within a solid medium, presumably cultured from a single cell. Because the colony is clonal, with all organisms in it descending from a single ancestor (assuming no contamination), they are genetically identical, except for any mutations (which occur at low frequencies). Obtaining such genetically identical organisms (or pure strains) can be useful; this is done by spreading organisms on a culture plate and starting a new stock from a single resulting colony.\n\nA biofilm is a colony of microorganisms often comprising several species, with properties and capabilities greater than the aggregate of capabilities of the individual organisms.\n\nIndividuals in social colonies and modular organisms receive benefit to such a lifestyle. For example, it may be easier to seek out food, defend a nesting site, or increase competitive ability against other species. Modular organisms' ability to reproduce asexually in addition to sexually allows them unique benefits that social colonies do not have.\n\nThe energy required for sexual reproduction varies based on the frequency and length of reproductive activity, number and size of offspring, and parental care. While solitary individuals bear all of those energy costs, individuals in some social colonies share a portion of those costs.\n\nModular organisms save energy by using asexual reproduction during their life. Energy reserved in this way allows them to put more energy towards colony growth, regenerating lost modules (due to predation or other cause of death), or response to environmental conditions.\n"}

William was looking for a quick end to the fighting in Ireland, as he was the leader of the Grand Alliance against Louis XIV and his presence was urgently needed elsewhere in Europe. The Declaration was drafted by Sir Richard Cox, 1st Baronet, the future Lord Chancellor of Ireland. William approved the final draft and said he hardly needed to change a word of it.\n\nWhile offering a full protection (effectively a pardon) to those who surrendered by 1 August (this was later extended to 25 August), the Declaration significantly excepted those who were \"the desperate leaders of the present rebellion\". This was an attempt to split the rank-and-file Jacobites away from their leadership. This repeated a tactic employed by Oliver Cromwell during his Irish Campaign forty years earlier.\n\nDespite the Williamites capturing the Irish capital of Dublin, the uncompromising terms set out at Finglas encouraged many leaders to fight on, and this was reinforced by the successful defence of Limerick the same summer. Much of the ordinary population remained loyal to the landowners and to King James while William increasingly had to concentrate his forces in Southern England and Flanders to confront the French, leading to the war dragging on for another year in Ireland.\n\nThe Treaty of Limerick in 1691 granted more generous terms to the defeated Jacobites than had been offered at Finglas, allowing them to retain their pre-war estates. This met with many objections from the Irish Parliament who felt the terms offered had been too generous. Nonetheless, a sizeable number of the Jacobite leaders went into exile on the continent in the Flight of the Wild Geese, continuing to swear loyalty to James II and his successors.\n\n"}

The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line or tone than on colour, especially drawing and the various forms of engraving; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to printmaking processes, such as line engraving, aquatint, drypoint, etching, mezzotint, monotype, lithography, and screen printing (silk-screen, serigraphy). Graphic art further includes calligraphy, photography, painting, typography, computer graphics, and bindery. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs.\n\nThroughout history, technological inventions have shaped the development of graphic art. In 2500 BC, the Egyptians used graphic symbols to communicate their thoughts in a written form known as hieroglyphics. The Egyptians wrote and illustrated narratives on rolls of papyrus to share the stories and art with others.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, scribes manually copied each individual page of manuscripts to maintain their sacred teachings. The scribes would leave marked sections of the page available for artists to insert drawings and decorations. Using art alongside the carefully lettered text enhanced the religious reading experience.\n\nJohannes Gutenberg invented an improved movable type mechanical device known as the printing press in 1450, the first outside of Asia. His printing press facilitated the mass-production of text and graphic art and eventually, replaced manual transcriptions altogether.\n\nAgain during the Renaissance years, graphic art in the form of printing played a major role in the spread of classical learning in Europe. Within these manuscripts, book designers focused heavily on typeface.\n\nDue to the development of larger fonts during the Industrial Revolution, posters became a popular form of graphic art used to communicate the latest information as well as to advertise the latest products and services.\n\nThe invention and popularity of film and television changed graphic art through the additional aspect of motion as advertising agencies attempted to use kinetics to their advantage.\n\nThe next major change in graphic arts came when the personal computer was invented in the twentieth century. Powerful computer software enables artists to manipulate images in a much faster and simpler way than the skills of board artists prior to the 1990s. With quick calculations, computers easily recolor, scale, rotate, and rearrange images if the programs are known.\n\nThe scientific investigations into legibility has influenced such things as the design of street signs. New York City is in the process of changing out all of its street signs bearing all capital letters for replacement with signs bearing only upper and lower case letters. They estimate that the increased legibility will facilitate way-finding and reduce crashes and injuries significantly.\n\nGraphic artists applying for positions in today's job market are expected to be familiar with computers and a variety of software programs in order to create the most appealing, up to date designs.\n\nGraphic art software includes applications such as:\n\n\nBeside computers and software, graphic artists are also expected to be creative with processing camera work, registration, crop marks, and masking.\n\nOne of the most common career paths for a graphic artist today is web design. With the popularity of the World Wide Web, the demand for web designers is immense. Graphic artists use their creativity with layouts, typography, and logos to market the products or services of the client’s business. In addition to creating graphical designs, graphic artists also need to understand hypertext, web programming, and web page maintenance in order to successfully create a web page. The responsibility for effective communication also falls under the auspices of the graphic designer.\n\n"}

A former member of Alain de Benoist's New Right organisation GRECE, he took part in the splitting of the organization in 1986 alongside Yann-Ber Tillenon, , and . At that time he was close to nationalist neo-Pagans. Simultaneously, he made his way up as a journalist, namely in \"Figaro Magazine\", Paris-Match, VSD, etc. Guillaume Faye also led a journal called \"J'ai Tout Compris!\" (I Understood Everything!) which closed down soon after.\n\nIn 1987, Guillaume Faye withdrew from politics. In the year 1990 he took part in Skyrock radio station as 'Skyman'. He also appeared in \"Telematin\" episodes on the France 2 TV channel from 1991 to 1993. In 1998, he finally returned to politics after publishing some essays on various subjects such as culture and religion. Several of these essays were collected into his major work, \"Archeofuturism,\" which was published in English translation in 2010. This book lays out his fundamental ideas, including his opposition to immigration, his dismissal of contemporary European politics, his call for a pan-European government, and his concept of archeofuturism, which involves combining traditionalist spirituality and concepts of sovereignty with the latest advances in science and technology.\n\nIn 2000, Faye relaunched \"J'ai Tout Compris!\" as a monthly edition where he expresses his ideas: Faye predicts an abolition of European societies due to massive immigration, and a total war between the West and the Islamic world, endorsing the \"clash of civilization\" theory.\n\nHe takes part in the \"Rivarol\" journal and regularly collaborates with Pierre Vial's \"\" neo-Pagan group. He also participates in conferences abroad, such as with the US nationalist group American Renaissance on 3 March 2006.\n\nFaye has been criticized for his \"extremism\" by Alain de Benoist in a March 2000 interview published in the Italian review \"Area\", close to the \"Alleanza Nazionale\".\n\nIn 2007, he published \"La Nouvelle question juive\" (\"The New Jewish question\") in which he strongly criticized Holocaust deniers and many Third Positionists and anti-Zionists (such as Alain Soral or Christian Bouchet) whom he accuses of sympathy for Islamism. As a response, he was accused of being a \"national-Zionist\".\n\nSeveral of Faye's books have been translated into English and published by Arktos. These include \"Archeofuturism – European visions of the post-catastrophic age\" (2010), \"Why we Fight – manifesto of the European resistance\" (2011) and \"Convergence of Catastrophes\" (2012).\n\n\n"}

It is done to detect diseases early in people that may look and feel well.\n\nEvidence does not support routine health assessments in otherwise healthy people.\n\nHealth assessment is the evaluation of the health status of an individual along the health continuum. The purpose of the assessment is to establish where on the health continuum the individual is because this guides how to approach and treat the individual. The health continuum approaches range from preventative, to treatment, to palliative care in relation to the individual's status on the health continuum. It is not the treatment or treatment plan. The plan related to findings is a care plan which is preceded by the specialty such as medical, physical therapy, nursing, etc.\n\n\"Health assessment\" has been separated by authors from physical assessment to include the focus on health occurring on a continuum as a fundamental teaching. In the healthcare industry it is understood health occurs on a continuum, so the term used is \"assessment\" but may be preference by the speciality's focus such as nursing, physical therapy, etc. In healthcare, the assessment's focus is biopsychosocial but the intensity of focus may vary by the type of healthcare practitioner. For example, in the emergency room the focus is chief complaint and how to help that person related to the perceived problem. If the problem is a heart attack then the intensity of focus is on the biological/physical problem initially.\n\n"}

{"id": "51164668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51164668", "title": "Ho-Ren-So", "text": "Ho-Ren-So\n\n“Hō-Ren-Sō” (報・連・相) is a business mantra or mnemonic acronym in Japanese business culture. It is an “abbreviation of “\"Hōkoku\"” (報告, to report), “\"Renraku\"\" (連絡, to inform) and “\"Sōdan\"” (相談, to consult), and is more memorable as a homonym of \"hōrensō\", the Japanese word for \"spinach\". It is utilized as a basic business rule in Japan to conduct smooth business communication. The origin of “Ho-Ren-So” comes from Tomiji Yamazaki who was the ex-president of Yamatana Security firm. In 1982 he started using the term for effective business communication in his firm and it has been widely spread and used throughout Japan through his book, “Strengthen your company with Ho-Ren-So”.\n\n“\"Hokoku\"” is to report on a process or result of business from a subordinate to a superior. In Japan, subordinates don't have much authority to make business decision. Usually the decisions are made by an organization as a whole. Therefore, a subordinate must report everything to superior immediately and exactly. It is especially important to report a mistake or a problem immediately because his/her superior has the responsibility for it.\n\n“\"Renraku\"” is to inform facts. One must inform the facts and decision to the relevant parties. One should not include one's opinion and guesses. If \"\"Renraku\" is not done or not completed, then you cannot control your team. And then, \"Renraku\" communicated to the people who need it. Finally, \"Renraku\"\" done quickly. Its content might need to prepare for the next action.\n\n“\"Sodan\"” is to consult or discuss. For example, a superior give a subordinate an advice, and an employee talks over with superior about some unnecessary consultation in Japanese business. Because a superior rarely speaks to a subordinate in the Japanese company, but, they want to be asked for their advice. They want others to think that \"you can always count on me.\" So, they feel better if they receive request for consultation from their subordinate.\n\nThere are many benefits to incorporating the \"Ho-Ren-So\" philosophy. First, if a issues within tasks are reported, it can be resolved quickly because a manager controls it and decides how to resolve it. Next, if information is communicated with team members and it is known all members of a team, they can take ownership of the schedule and tasks. Finally, if information is consulted from a subordinate, a decrease of quality will be prevented and likely won't occur again.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some Cons in \"Ho-Ren-So\". First, there is a cost of management. It is a very time consuming process, leaving employees with little time to complete their various work assignments. Moreover, and since a subordinate must always wait instructions from his/her supervisor, this prevents employees from applying problem-solving skills on their own without the constant need for managerial input.\n"}

His familiar surroundings progresses, at a political level, from traditionalism to the Catalan nationalism closer to Lliga Regionalista. When his father's business goes to ruin, the family is determined to remain at Vallclara. But Sales, who by the time has became bachelor in Lleida, move to Barcelona despite he is only seventeen.\n\nJoan Sales acted very young in opposition to the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera.He was also one of the first Catalan language teachers of the official census of the Generalitat of Catalonia formed by Pompeu Fabra.\n\nHe graduated with a degree in law at the University of Barcelona in 1932. He affiliated with Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, which will leave soon. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he graduated at the School of War and was appointed official.

He worked there as linotypist. In exile, he drove a deeply ideological journal, \"Quaderns de l'Exili\" (1943–1947). His text \"Els Òrsides\"is a criticism to the intellectuals that do not assume the critical challenges of the country. From there, he edited with notes and studies, \"L'Atlàntida\", \"Canigó\", \"La nacionalitat catalana\" and the first edition of \"Poesies\" from Màrius Torres (1947).\n\nOnce returned to Catalonia in 1948, he focused on publishing tasks, discovering essential authors to the modern Catalan literature (Màrius Torres, Llorenç Villalonga and Mercè Rodoreda).\n\nIn 1955, he founded, with Xavier Benguerel and Joan Oliver, El Club dels Novel·listes, with which they wanted to expand the readership Catalan, developing a narrative and a more popular level language more accessible.\n\nSince its imprint, el Club Editor, he will offer to the public his work \"Uncertain glory\" (\"Incerta glòria\"), that do not appeared in definitive edition until 1971 and his epistolary war and exile \"Letters to Màrius Torres\" (1976). Other works include the book of poems \"Viatge d'un moribund\" (1952), his translations from Kazantzakis and Dostoyevski or the outline of a comic opera, music by Joan Altisent, \"En Tirant lo Blanc a Grècia\".\n\nSales was documentary and commentator of \"Historia de España\" and also of \"Història dels Catalans\" form Ferran Soldevila, and he wrote numerous works prologues for books from Joan Coromines, Mercè Rodoreda and Llorenç Villalonga.

However, in Erfurt he took up painting, under the influence of (1715–1778), a notable local painter specialising in animal portraits in the then-prevailing Baroque style. After his studies, Baumann returned to his Baltic homeland Courland but would henceforth pursue a career as an artist and not as a priest.\n\nBeing a keen hunter, Baumann travelled as far as present-day Lithuania, Russia and Belarus on hunting expeditions. He also wrote anecdotal, whimsical short stories about his hunting adventures, for which he has been called the \"Munchausen of Courland\". His outdoors interests also came to dominate his art completely, which is an unusual blend of skillfulness and professionalism mixed with naivety and slovenliness. Almost all his known paintings depict animals, hunting scenes or related subjects. His style is perhaps best characterised as a provincial form of Baroque, inspired to some extent by similar motives in Dutch Golden Age painting, executed in a highly personal way. Although he never became recognised as a major artist in Imperial Russia, he was still acknowledged by a special mention of the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1786.

{"id": "1556776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1556776", "title": "Line officer", "text": "Line officer\n\nIn the United States Armed Forces, the term line officer or officer of the line refers to a U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps, commissioned officer or warrant officer who exercises general command authority and is eligible for operational command positions, as opposed to officers who normally exercise command authority only within a Navy Staff Corps. The term \"line officer\" is also used by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard to indicate that an officer is eligible for command of operational, viz., tactical or \"combat\" units. The term is not generally used by officers of the U.S. Army – the roughly corresponding Army terms are basic branch (e.g, Infantry) and special branch, (e.g., Medical Corps) qualified officers, although the concepts are not entirely synonymous, as some Army special branch officers (i.e., Judge Advocate General's Corps) are eligible to hold command outside their branch specialty.\n\nOfficers who are not line officers are those whose primary duties are generally in non-combat specialties including (depending upon the service) attorneys, chaplains, civil engineers, health services professionals, and logistics and financial management specialists. A line officer may hold authority over a non-line officer of higher rank by the nature of their assignment or appointment/succession to command, but is otherwise expected to observe normal customs and courtesies outside that role.\n\n\"See explanation of staff and line.\"\n\nThe expression \"officer of the line\" is possibly rooted in the 18th- and 19th-century Royal Navy practice of employing sail-powered warships in line formations to maximize the effectiveness of side-mounted cannons. The ships were called ships of the line and their officers were termed line officers. The term also derives from \"walking the line\" and in many military circles is believed to have come from a \"line in the sand\" which two groups of officers once used in a political argument to gain power.\n\nIn the United States Navy (and USN Reserve), line officers are divided into unrestricted line officers, limited duty officers, and restricted line officers. Unrestricted Line (URL) officers hold combat warfare specialties as Naval Aviators and Naval Flight Officers, Surface Warfare Officers, Submarine Warfare Officers, and Naval Special Warfare/Naval Special Operations (NSW/NSO) officers (consisting of SEALs, Special Warfare Combatant-Craft (SWCC) Warrant Officers, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) officers, and Navy diving officers), and are eligible for operational combatant command at sea, as well as command of major installations and commands ashore. Restricted Line officers command only within their particular specialty, and are normally in fields such as intelligence, cryptology, oceanography/meteorology, engineering duty, aeronautical engineering duty, aircraft maintenance, public affairs, etc. \n\nNavy Limited Duty Officers and Warrant Officers whose technical specialties fall within a staff corps are considered staff corps officers, while all others are classed of the Line. Line officers wear an inverted gold star above their rank stripes on their dress blue uniforms and, in the case of Captains (US pay grade O-6/NATO OF-5) and below, on their shoulder boards in whites. Line officer flag officers (admirals O-7 to O-10/NATO OF-6 to OF-9) will wear solid gold shoulder boards with a silver metallic thread anchor and one, two, three, or four silver metallic thread stars below the anchor. When wearing khakis or utility/working uniforms, they wear their rank insignia on both collar points. The Navy refers to non-line officers as Staff Corps officers. (Both line and staff corps officers may be assigned as \"staff officers\" serving on the command staff of a senior officer.) Staff corps officers wear their corps insignia, rather than the line officer star, placed over their sleeve/shoulder board stripes on their dress blue and dress white uniforms, and on their left collar point on khakis and utility/working uniforms in lieu of matching pin-on rank insignia on the right collar point.\n\nIn the United States Marine Corps (and USMC Reserve), all officers – including warrant officers and limited duty officers (LDOs) – are line officers, trained to command combat units, although Marine officers cannot command ships or shore organizations of the Navy. Unlike the Navy, the Marine Corps does not have any staff corps, consequently all Marine engineer and supply officers, and judge advocates, are line officers. The Marine Corps has no medical corps officers, dental corps officers, nurse corps officers, or chaplain corps officers. Because the Marine Corps is a service within the Department of the Navy, these staff corps billets in the Marine Corps are normally filled by US Navy staff corps officers in those specialties, serving alongside Marines in Marine units, although officers of the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service may be detailed, as well.\n\nIn the United States Air Force (and USAF Reserve), officers assigned to the medical, nurse, medical services (healthcare administration), biosciences, judge advocate, and chaplain corps are \"professional\" officers. In addition to being professional officers, judge advocates in the Air Force are also considered line officers and, like all other officers in operational/combat and combat support specialties, belong to the Line of the Air Force (LAF). The Air Force has no warrant officers.\n\nAll commissioned and warrant officers of the United States Coast Guard and United States Coast Guard Reserve are considered line officers. They wear the US Coast Guard shield in lieu of the inverted star of US Navy line officers on their shoulder boards and above the sleeve braid on dress uniforms. Like the US Marine Corps, the Coast Guard does have line officers serving as judge advocates, but has no officers serving as chaplains or in the health-care fields. Therefore, US Navy staff corps officers (from the chaplain, medical, dental, and nurse corps) may be detailed to serve at Coast Guard units, and are not Coast Guard line officers. These individuals do wear the Coast Guard uniform, albeit with some differences. Additionally, US Public Health Service commissioned officers are the primary source of health care officers in the Coast Guard, serving alongside U.S. Navy staff corps officers and Coast Guardsmen in Coast Guard units. They too will wear the Coast Guard uniform, albeit with some differences. Health services officers in the USPHS commissioned corps detailed to the Coast Guard represent many disciplines, including the biological, physical, environmental, and social sciences; medical technology; health care administration; and other public health specialties such as physician assistant.\n\nThe expression \"line officer\" is no longer current in the Royal Navy and Commonwealth affiliates. Officers trained in the \"Executive Department\" of a warship are the only ones trained for command.\nIn the Royal Canadian Navy, officers in the Naval Warfare Officer (NWO) occupation hold a similar function, but are not distinguished by any identifiable badge.\n\n"}

It is located in Northern Courland and encompasses twelve Livonian villages. The protected area is about 60 kilometers long.\n\nOn February 4, 1992, the Latvian government created a culturally protected territory called \"\" – the Livonian Coast – which included all twelve of the Livonian villages: Lūžņa (Livonian: Lūž), Miķeļtornis (Pizā), Lielirbe (Īra), Jaunciems (Ūžkilā), Sīkrags (Sīkrõg), Mazirbe (Irē), Košrags (Kuoštrõg), Saunags (Sǟnag), Vaide (Vaid), Kolka (Kūolka) (see also Cape Kolka), Pitrags (Pitrõg), and Melnsils (Mustānum). The Latvian government discourages new settlements here and prohibits alterations to historical village sites. Also, it is restricted for anyone to start a hotel, restaurant, or other public establishment which might adversely influence the Livonian culture or draw outsiders into the area. However, there has been number old fishermen or farmer houses converted into modern summerhouses by Latvian higher class as well as some well-off descendants of local Liv families. Among them is former President of Latvia, former Prime Minister, Ministers, politicians, CEOs, bankers and businessmen, artists, doctors, etc. There are some prominent German, Russian and Swedish residents. The coast is also becoming more popular with Lithuanians. The Livonian Coast is part of Slītere National Park.\n\nUntil World War I these villages were connected only by small forest roads along the coast and were practically inaccessible from inland. Most deliveries were made by the sea and most villages had their own pier (remains of piers can still be seen in Saunags, Pitrags and Mazirbe; only Kolka pier is still in use). During World War I the German Army built a narrow-gauge railway behind the dunes to move ammunition and wood. The railway connected Pitrags, Mazirbe and Lielirbe with Dundaga, a small regional town. Earthworks were installed to extend railway from Pitrags to Saunags and Vaide, but the work was interrupted by moving front lines. Between the two wars, the railway was the main method for passenger transportation along the Livonian coast. After World War II, in 1950s the Soviet Army built a wide dirt road connecting all the villages and the railway become obsolete. The railway was closed completely in 1960s, but there are several straight sections of roads or passages which still can be seen behind the dunes in Saunags and Pitrags, and in forests in Mazirbe and Lielirbe. During 2009-2011 the dirt road was asphalted and modernised as part of EU funded Kolka-Ventspils road project. Several years ago replica Mazirbe railway station (original station is still standing now as a private house in Mazirbe) was re-created as part of narrow gauge railway line in Ventspils, along with a restored engine and carriages, and is now used as a tourist attraction.\n\n\n"}

However, the classical languages continue to have influence over the colloquial Neo-Aramaic languages.\n\nNortheastern Neo-Aramaic and Central Neo-Aramaic dialects are spoken primarily (though not wholly exclusively) by ethnic Assyrians, who are members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church (Eastern Rite Catholics), Syriac Orthodox Church, Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church. The Assyrians are an indigenous people of Iraq, northeast Syria, southeast Turkey and northwest Iran, descendants of the ancient Mesopotamians.\n\nToday the number of fluent Neo-Aramaic speakers is significantly smaller, and newer generations of Assyrians generally are not acquiring the full language, especially as many have emigrated and acculturated into their new resident countries.\n\nThe numbers of fluent speakers of Neo-Aramaic languages range from approximately 575,000 to 1,000,000. The largest of these are Assyrian Neo-Aramaic with approximately 235,000 speakers, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic with approximately 216,000 speakers and Surayt/Turoyo with approximately 250,000 speakers. While these are often associated with specific religious affiliations among Assyrians (Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Orthodox Church respectively) these dialects have speakers from different churches amongst their numbers, for example, a member of the Chaldean Catholic Church may speak Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, and a member of the Assyrian Church of the East or Syriac Orthodox Church may speak Chaldean Neo-Aramaic. There are also smaller numbers of speakers of smaller Northeastern Neo-Aramaic languages, notably Jews originally from Kurdistan, in approximate number of dozens of thousands of speakers in Israel, Western Neo-Aramaic, Judeo-Aramaic languages and Neo-Mandaic.\n\nThroughout the history of the Aramaic language, a clear dialect boundary dividing western and eastern varieties has existed, running transversely across the Syrian Desert from southeast to northwest. Eastern Aramaic has remained dominant throughout history, and all classical languages are eastern varieties originating in Mesopotamia (Assyria-Babylonia). Only Western Neo-Aramaic, spoken in Maaloula and surrounding villages in the Anti-Lebanon by Syriac-Aramean Christian communities, remains as a witness to the once widespread western varieties of the Levant and Transjordan.\n\nNeo-Aramaic languages are not uniform; they grew out of pockets of Aramaic-speaking communities that have held fast to their language through the changes of past centuries. Therefore, the dialect continuum is incomplete, with many varieties absent. Mutual intelligibility between the varieties of the group is limited to closest neighbours only. However, many of the varieties share features that have developed in parallel from Middle Aramaic varieties and the classical languages.\n\nThe other Neo-Aramaic languages are all eastern varieties, but with little homogeneity. Most distinct in this group is Modern Mandaic, which has low intelligibility with other varieties. It is the direct descendant of Classical Mandaic, which traces its roots back to the Persian-influenced Aramaic of the Arsacid Empire. Modern Mandaic is spoken fluently by about 6,000 people mostly in Ahvaz, Iran, all of whom are Mandaeans, a Gnostic ethnic minority with approximately 70,000 followers in Iraq and Iran, most of whom have largely adopted Arabic or Persian despite being non-Arab and non-Iranian ethnically.\n\nThe other Eastern Neo-Aramaic languages have a lot more in common with each other. Some studies have labelled this group \"Central Neo-Aramaic\" (however, that name is also used for a smaller subgrouping) or \"Northern Neo-Aramaic\". These languages can be divided in various ways. Sometimes they are divided by religion into Jewish and Christian varieties. However, there is not complete intelligibility throughout either religious community, and on occasion better intelligibility across the religious divide. From this group, the Christian varieties of the extreme north-west of MesopotamiaCentral Neo-Aramaic (confusingly different from the definition above)stand apart. \n\nThis subgrouping is witnessed by Turoyo ( Surayt) and the now extinct Mlahsô, both influenced by the Classical Syriac of Sassanid Assyria (Assuristan). The other varieties, both Jewish and Christian, form the largest subgrouping of Neo-Aramaic, which is usually referred to as Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA). Christian NENA varieties are influenced by Classical Syriac, but to a lesser degree than Central Neo-Aramaic, and appear to retain some Akkadian loan words and grammatical structures; Jewish NENA varieties are influenced by Targumic Aramaic.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24286709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24286709", "title": "Nested word", "text": "Nested word\n\nIn computer science, more specifically in automata and formal language theory, nested words are a concept proposed by Alur and Madhusudan as a joint generalization of words, as traditionally used for modelling linearly ordered structures, and of ordered unranked trees, as traditionally used for modelling hierarchical structures. Finite-state acceptors for nested words,\nso-called nested word automata, then give a more expressive generalization of finite automata on words. The linear encodings of languages accepted by finite nested word automata gives the class of visibly pushdown languages. The latter language class lies properly between the regular languages and the deterministic context-free languages. Since their introduction in 2004, these concepts have triggered much research in that area.\n\nTo define \"nested words\", we first need to define \"matching relation\". As usual, for a nonnegative integer formula_1, we use the notation formula_2 to denote the set formula_3, with the special case formula_4.\n\nA \"matching relation\" ↝ of length formula_5 is a subset of formula_6 such that:\nA position \"i\" is referred to as \n\nA \"nested word\" of length formula_1 over an alphabet Σ is a pair (\"w\",↝), where \"w\" is a word of length formula_1over Σ (in the usual sense) and ↝ is a matching relation of length formula_1.\n\nNested words over the alphabet formula_10 can be encoded into \"ordinary\" words over the \"tagged alphabet\" formula_11, in which each symbol \"a\" from Σ has three tagged counterparts: the\nsymbol ⟨a for encoding a call position in a nested word labelled with \"a\", the symbol a⟩ for encoding a return position labelled with \"a\", and finally the symbol a itself for representing an internal position labelled with \"a\". More precisely, let \"φ\" be the function mapping nested words over Σ to words over formula_12 such that each nested word (formula_13,↝) is mapped to the word formula_14, where the letter formula_15 equals ⟨a, a, and a⟩, if formula_16 and \"i\" is a (possibly pending) call position, an internal position, and a (possibly pending) return position, respectively.\n\nFor illustration, let \"n\"=(\"w\",↝) be the nested word over a ternary alphabet with \"w\"=\"abaabccca\" and matching relation }. Then its encoding as word reads as \"φ\"(\"n\") = \"a\"⟩⟨\"b\"⟨\"aa\"⟩⟨\"bcc\"⟩⟨\"ca\".\n\nA \"nested word automaton\" has a finite number of states, and operates in almost the same way as a deterministic finite automaton on classical strings: a classical finite automaton reads the input word formula_17 from left to right, and the state of the automaton after reading the \"j\"th letter formula_18 depends on the state in which the automaton was before reading formula_18.\n\nIn a nested word automaton, the position formula_20 in the nested word (w,↝) might be a return position; if so, the state after reading formula_18 will not only depend on the \"linear state\" in which the automaton was before reading formula_18, but also on a \"hierarchical state\" propagated by the automaton at the time it was in the corresponding call position. In analogy to regular languages of words, a set \"L\" of nested words is called \"regular\" if it is accepted by some (finite-state) nested word automaton.\n\nNested word automata are an automaton model accepting nested words. There is an equivalent automaton model operating on (ordinary) words. Namely, the notion of a deterministic visibly pushdown automaton is a restriction of the notion of a deterministic pushdown automaton.\n\nFollowing Alur and Madhusudan, a deterministic visibly pushdown automaton is formally defined as a 6-tuple formula_23\nwhere\n\nThe notion of \"computation\" of a visibly pushdown automaton is a restriction of the one used for pushdown automata. Visibly pushdown automata only add a symbol to the stack when reading a call symbol formula_40, they only remove the top element from the stack when reading a return symbol formula_41 and they do not alter the stack when reading an internal event formula_42. A computation ending in an accepting state is an \"accepting computation\".\n\nAs a result, a visibly pushdown automaton cannot push to and pop from the stack with the same input symbol. Thus the language formula_43 cannot be accepted by a visibly pushdown automaton for any partition of formula_44, however there are pushdown automata accepting this language.\n\nIf a language formula_45 over a tagged alphabet formula_12 is accepted by a deterministic visibly pushdown automaton, then formula_45 is called a \"visibly pushdown language\".\n\nNondeterministic visibly pushdown automata are as expressive as deterministic ones. Hence one can transform a nondeterministic visibly pushdown automaton into a deterministic one, but if the nondeterministic automaton had formula_48 states, the deterministic one may have up to formula_49 states.\n\nLet formula_50 be the size of the description of an automaton formula_51, then it is possible to check if a word \"n\" is accepted by the automaton in time formula_52. In particular, the emptiness problem is solvable in time formula_53.\nIf formula_51 is fixed, it is decidable in time formula_55 and space formula_56 where formula_57 is the depth of \"n\" in a streaming seeing. It is also decidable with space formula_58 and time formula_59, and by a uniform boolean circuit of depth formula_60.\n\nFor two nondeterministic automata \"A\" and \"B\", deciding whether the set of words accepted by \"A\" is a subset of the word accepted by \"B\" is EXPTIME-complete. It is also EXPTIME-complete to figure out if there is a word that is not accepted.\n\nAs the definition of visibly pushdown automata shows, deterministic visibly pushdown automata can be seen as a special case of deterministic pushdown automata; thus the set VPL of visibly pushdown languages over formula_61 forms a subset of the set DCFL of deterministic context-free languages over the set of symbols in formula_61. In particular, the function that removes the matching relation from nested words transforms regular languages over nested words into context-free languages.\n\nThe set of visibly pushdown languages is closed under the following operations:\n\nFor the intersection operation, one can construct a VPA \"M\" simulating two given VPAs formula_63 and formula_64 by a simple product construction : For formula_65, assume formula_66 is given as formula_67. Then for the automaton \"M\", the set of states is formula_68, the initial state is formula_69, the set of final states is formula_70, the stack alphabet is given by formula_71, and the initial stack symbol is formula_72.\n\nIf formula_73 is in state formula_74 on reading a \"call symbol\" formula_75, then\nformula_73 pushes the stack symbol formula_77\nand goes to state formula_78, where formula_79 is the stack symbol pushed by formula_66\nwhen transitioning from state formula_81 to formula_82 on reading input formula_75.\n\nIf formula_73 is in state formula_74 on reading an \"internal symbol\" formula_86, then formula_73\ngoes to state formula_78, whenever formula_66\ntransitions from state formula_81 to formula_82 on reading \"a\".\n\nIf formula_73 is in state formula_74 on reading a \"return symbol\" formula_94, then formula_73\npops the symbol formula_77 from the stack and\ngoes to state formula_78, where formula_79 is the stack symbol popped by formula_66\nwhen transitioning from state formula_81 to formula_82 on reading formula_94.\n\nCorrectness of the above construction crucially relies on the fact that the push and pop actions of the simulated\nmachines formula_63 and formula_64 are synchronized along the input symbols read. In fact, a similar simulation is no longer possible for deterministic pushdown automata, as the larger class of deterministic context-free languages is no longer closed under intersection.\n\nIn contrast to the construction for concatenation shown above, the complementation construction for visibly pushdown automata parallels the standard construction for deterministic pushdown automata.\n\nMoreover, like the class of context free languages the class of visibly pushdown languages is closed under prefix closure and reversal, hence also suffix closure.\n\n point out that the visibly pushdown languages are more general than the parenthesis languages suggested in . As shown by , the VPL in turn are strictly contained in the class of languages described by operator-precedence grammars, which were introduced by and enjoy the same closure properties and characteristics (see for ω languages and logic and automata-based characterizations). In comparison to conjunctive grammars, a generalization of context-free grammars, shows that the linear conjunctive languages form a superclass of the visibly pushdown languages. The table at the end of this article puts the family of visibly pushdown languages in relation to other language families in the Chomsky hierarchy.\nRajeev Alur and Parthasarathy Madhusudan related a subclass of regular binary tree languages to visibly pushdown languages.\n\nVisibly pushdown languages are exactly the languages that can be described by \"visibly pushdown grammars\".\n\nVisibly pushdown grammars can be defined as a restriction of context-free grammars. A visibly pushdown grammar \"G\" is defined by the 4-tuple:\n\nformula_105 where\n\nHere, the asterisk represents the Kleene star operation and formula_131 is the empty word.\n\nThe problem whether a word of length formula_1 is accepted by a given nested word automaton can be solved by uniform boolean circuits of depth formula_133.\n\nRegular languages over nested words are exactly the set of languages described by Monadic second-order logic with two unary predicates \"call\" and \"return\", linear successor and the matching relation ↝.\n\n\n\n"}

The P stands for \"parallel\" and refers to load-bearing walls arranged parallel to wall surfaces. 2 denotes the arrangement of two stairways in a building.\n\nThe first building of this type was built in 1961 as an experimental building in Berlin-Lichtenberg. The original building was located at Erich-Kuttner-Straße 9-15 in the Fennpfuhl district and is now a listed building.\n\nA P2 building is characterized by the arrangement of apartments around a nearly square interior stairwell, often equipped with a glass roof. The buildings have five to eleven stories and there are usually two apartments per floor, although some designs have three apartments per floor, above and below the stairwell access.\n\nAs a standard design, the P2 is five or six stories high, with the lowest floor raised half a story above the ground. This allows natural light and ventilation to the basement, and minimizes the excavation required for the foundation. The building interior can be accessed by way of an outdoor stairway or via a half-staircase in the entrance area.\n\nThe staircase and access area reduce the amount of space available for a ground floor apartment. Therefore the ground floor arrangement consists of a four-room apartment and a one-bedroom apartment - unlike the symmetric three-bedroom apartments on the upper floors. The remaining space is configured as a hallway.\n\nIn P2-buildings with more than six stories, every third floor has a \"distribution hallway\". The hallway is usually located on the entrance side of a building and serves as the access or entrance to stairwells, elevators, waste discharge and storerooms. The apartments located above or below the distribution hallways are not accessed directly from the elevator, but via a staircase. Typically the distribution hallways are arranged like this:\n\n\nAs a standard, apartments in P2-buildings have one-to-four rooms. In buildings with special elements, such as a trapezoidal shape, there are also 5-room apartments with two rooms that have no right angles.\n\nOriginally there were no loggias on the raised ground floor. Ground floor loggias were added later in the course of reconstruction work.\n\nThe novelty of the bathrooms and kitchens is optimization of space. The bathrooms and kitchens are located inside and next to each other and they utilize the same supply shaft for water, sewage and ventilation. Bathrooms are fully equipped sanitary room modules (including toilet, sink, tub, faucets and washing machine connection; and kitchen modules include vertical supply and disposal lines. During construction they are lifted into the shell construction in one piece. The bathroom and kitchen modules require a simple connection to the pipes at ground level for installation. The walls of the service shaft are made of different materials, ranging from press board over plaster to massive concrete elements.\n\nThe designers avoided the typical kitchen and separate dining room arrangement, which required a lengthwise format and separated the family during meal preparation. This arrangement reduced living space and therefore reduced expenses. The designers hoped to integrate women more effectively into the family by opening the kitchen to the living room and thereby encouraging men to participate in the household. The kitchens were initially connected to the living rooms by large service hatches in the form of built-in furniture.\n\nAfter widespread criticism that the kitchen was not isolated enough from the living room, later buildings incorporated concrete walls with a small hatch window. In the last series produced, the kitchen was completely separated from the living room by a wall. Daylight fell into the kitchen only through the door or service hatch.\n\n\n"}

They received the name Paraujano from the neighboring Guajiros. The combination of \"palaa\", meaning ‘sea’, and \"anu͂\" literally means ‘people of the sea’, or fishermen. The Paraujano live in palafittes and are skilled at fishing at boating.\nAccording to a 2011 census, more than 21,000 people identify as Paraujano.\n\nParaujano is a Northern Arawakan, or Maipuran, language. It is derived from Gaujiro, yet is a distinct language and not a dialect of Gaujiro. The two languages are closely related. According to lexicostatistical analysis conducted by Oliver (1989) the two languages must have diverged around A.D. 900.\n\nParaujano is critically endangered and nearly extinct. The Maracaibo region began transforming into a largely populated industrial center in the early 1900s, as petroleum was extracted from the Maracaibo Lake. As the Paraujano mingled with others early on, their language was spread and spoken by some newcomers. However, by the 1970s there were only thirteen speakers remaining. Today there is one surviving fluent speaker, a thirty-year-old by the name of Yofri Márquez, who learned the language from his grandmother. There are a few partial speakers, most of whom are elderly.

Out the eighty-nine available words from the Swadesh list, six are Spanish substitutes.\n\nThe Paraujano phoneme contains 14 pulmonic consonants and 11 vowels.\n\nThe Paraujano phoneme differs from closely related Guajiro, mainly in vowels and due to the incorporation of Spanish lexicon.

{"id": "60006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60006", "title": "Police perjury", "text": "Police perjury\n\nPolice perjury (or testilying in United States police slang) is the act of a police officer giving false testimony. It is typically used in a criminal trial to \"make the case\" against a defendant believed by the police to be guilty when irregularities during the suspect's arrest or search threaten to result in acquittal.\n\nIt also can be extended further to encompass substantive misstatements of fact for the purpose of convicting those whom the police believe to be guilty, or even to include statements to frame an innocent citizen. More generically, it has been said to be \"[l]ying under oath, especially by a police officer, to help get a conviction.\"\n\n\"Testilying\" is a portmanteau of \"testify\" and \"lying\". Defendants who embellish their own testimony, particularly when no evidence contradicts them, can also be said to be testilying. It is said to be a type of police corruption.\n\nThe word \"testilying\" and its meaning have been publicized by defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, notably in a 1994 \"New York Times\" article, \"Accomplices to Perjury\", in which he said: \nAs I read about the disbelief expressed by some prosecutors... I thought of Claude Rains's classic response, in \"Casablanca\" on being told there was gambling in Rick's place: \"I'm shocked—shocked.\" For anyone who has practiced criminal law in the state or Federal courts, the disclosures about rampant police perjury cannot possibly come as a surprise. \"Testilying\"—as the police call it—has long been an open secret among prosecutors, defense lawyers, and judges.\n\nThere seems to be little doubt that the practice occurs, is not limited to any region of the country, and that \"testilying\" is a common name for it. A 2003 \"Boston Globe\" editorial noted:\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Mollen Commission peeled away layers of falsehood in the New York City Police Department, including false statements on warrant applications, creation of confidential informants out of whole cloth, and lies told to establish probable cause for stopping and searching vehicles. So-called \"testilying,\" however, is not limited to any one area or police department. The problem has become so acute that juries nationwide routinely express skepticism about law enforcement testimony, such as drugs found \"in plain view\".\n\nThe LAPD is said to call the practice \"joining the liars' club\". In a 1996 article in the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Has the Drug War Created an Officer Liars' Club?,\" Joseph D. McNamara, then chief of police of San Jose, said \"Not many people took defense attorney Alan M. Dershowitz seriously when he charged that Los Angeles cops are taught to lie at the birth of their careers at the Police Academy. But as someone who spent 35 years wearing a police uniform, I've come to believe that hundreds of thousands of law-enforcement officers commit felony perjury every year testifying about drug arrests.\" He noted that \"Within the last few years, police departments in Los Angeles, Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco, Denver, New York and in other large cities have suffered scandals involving police personnel lying under oath about drug evidence.\"\n\nPolice officers who have been dishonest are sometimes referred to as \"Brady cops\". In \"Brady v. Maryland\", the Supreme Court held that prosecutors are required to notify defendants and their attorneys of any favorable evidence, such as if a law enforcement official involved in their case has a sustained record for knowingly lying in an official capacity.\n\nThe extent of the practice is hotly debated. Rank and file policemen, police advocates and police unions acknowledge that it does occur but deny that it is widespread or systemic. In 1995, the \"Boston Globe\" reported that New York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton created a furor when he said he agreed with most of what Dershowitz had to say. The \"Globe\" quoted Richard Bradley, president of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association: \"I find it incredible that he would say that. Every day all over the country, police officers are testifying. Everyone realizes they are testifying under oath. If this was this much a problem, it would have come to light over the years.\" Bradley said that in 27 years on the Boston force he had never encountered the practice. In 2011, former San Francisco Police Commissioner Peter Keane wrote that lying under oath was a \"routine practice\" for narcotics officers.\n\nDespite the alleged beneficent public purpose behind police telling liesthus the use of the term \"testilying\" to make clear the fact that these are intentional liesthe existence has severe repercussions. Police officers can put their livelihood and their pension on the line in furtherance of a conspiracy. And if they are caught in the lie, guilty criminal defendants be set free because of otherwise unwarranted acquittals, or because the evidence is tossed at a suppression hearing. And, of course, when the police lie under oath, innocent people can be convicted and jailed. Hundreds of convictions have been set aside as a result of such scandals.\n\nSome sources say it is both a police and prosecutorial problem, and is a systemic response to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine recognized in \"Mapp v. Ohio\". Other authors have drawn a connection between perjury and an increased emphasis on the number of arrests and convictions made.\n\nIn 2011, after finding a police officer, Jason Arbeeny, guilty of official misconduct for planting drugs on a suspect, Justice Gustin L. Reichbach of the New York Supreme Court wrote that he \"thought [he] was not naïve, but even this court was shocked, not only by the seeming pervasive scope of misconduct but even more distressingly by the seeming casualness by which such conduct is employed\". The ex police detective was then sentenced to five years of probation and 300 hours of community service.\n\nSome suggest that narrowing or blunting the exclusionary rule may get rid of the incentive for testilying. This has happened to the extent that court in the United States have recognized \"good faith\" exceptions. Some argue that increased civil liability may have a prophylactic effect on police misconduct. Others suggest that the ubiquity of video recordings, both by the police and civilians, will operate to slow down the misconduct and reverse the trend.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27952971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27952971", "title": "Proof (truth)", "text": "Proof (truth)\n\nA proof is sufficient evidence or a sufficient argument for the truth of a proposition.\n\nThe concept applies in a variety of disciplines,\nwith both the nature of the evidence or justification and the criteria for sufficiency being area-dependent. In the area of oral and written communication such as conversation, dialog, rhetoric, etc., a proof is a persuasive perlocutionary speech act, which demonstrates the truth of a proposition. In any area of mathematics defined by its assumptions or axioms, a proof is an argument establishing a theorem of that area via accepted rules of inference starting from those axioms and from other previously established theorems. The subject of logic, in particular proof theory, formalizes and studies the notion of formal proof. In some areas of epistemology and theology, the notion of justification plays approximately the role of proof, while in jurisprudence the corresponding term is evidence,\nwith \"burden of proof\" as a concept common to both philosophy and law.\n\nIn most disciplines, evidence is required to prove something. Evidence is drawn from experience of the world around us, with science obtaining its evidence from nature, law obtaining its evidence from witnesses and forensic investigation, and so on. A notable exception is mathematics, whose proofs are drawn from a mathematical world begun with axioms and further developed and enriched by theorems proved earlier.\n\nExactly what evidence is sufficient to prove something is also strongly area-dependent, usually with no absolute threshold of sufficiency at which evidence becomes proof. In law, the same evidence that may convince one jury may not persuade another. Formal proof provides the main exception, where the criteria for proofhood are ironclad and it is impermissible to defend any step in the reasoning as \"obvious\" (except for the necessary ability of the one proving and the one being proven to, to correctly identify any symbol used in the proof.); for a well-formed formula to qualify as part of a formal proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus of some formal system to the previous well-formed formulae in the proof sequence.\n\nProofs have been presented since antiquity. Aristotle used the observation that patterns of nature never display the machine-like uniformity of determinism as proof that chance is an inherent part of nature. On the other hand, Thomas Aquinas used the observation of the existence of rich patterns in nature as proof that nature is \"not\" ruled by chance.\n\nProofs need not be verbal. Before Copernicus, people took the apparent motion of the Sun across the sky as proof that the Sun went round the Earth. Suitably incriminating evidence left at the scene of a crime may serve as proof of the identity of the perpetrator. Conversely, a verbal entity need not assert a proposition to constitute a proof of that proposition. For example, a signature constitutes direct proof of authorship; less directly, handwriting analysis may be submitted as proof of authorship of a document. Privileged information in a document can serve as proof that the document's author had access to that information; such access might in turn establish the location of the author at certain time, which might then provide the author with an alibi.\n\n"}

It is spoken in the province of Santiago del Estero. The estimated coordinates are 27°47′S 64°16′W. Long-standing migration has also resulted in the presence of the language in other provinces of northeastern Argentina and in Buenos Aires. \n\nIt is 81% similar to other Quechuan languages. There are radio programs in this languages and also a dictionary. There is some cultivation of the language as it is taught in some schools. It uses the Roman alphabet. Its speakers are Native Americans and they mostly work in agriculture. It is the seventh-most widely spoken language in Argentina behind Spanish, Italian, Levantine Arabic, South Bolivian Quechua, Standard German, and Mapudungun. It is the third most widely spoken indigenous language.\n\nThere was once another dialect of Southern Quechua in Argentina, that of Catamarca and La Rioja, but it has gone extinct. All were introduced during the Spanish colonial period, as Quechua speakers were transplanted to various parts of the Spanish realm (continuing a practice of the Inca), and Quechua was an official language of Santiago, Catamarca, and La Rioja during the colonial era.\n\nQuechuan, Peripheral Quechua, Chinchay\n\nThe indigenous people of Santiago del Estero were referred to as the \"tonocoté\". They faced much criticism from the rest of the Argentinian population which led to the diminishing of their language and culture as a whole. The government even went so far as to release flyers describing what these indigenous people looked like, including red skin and the use of feathers in their clothing. For this reason, they were singled out among the rest of the Hispanic population. Instead of learning their maternal language of Santiagueño Quechua at school, indigenous children were looked over and forced to learn the official Spanish language, which is a contributing factor as to why this language became endangered.\n\nThe verb of movement \"to go\" has been extensively studied and compared to other dialects of Quechua. It was found that while in other dialects, this verb is used to represent physical movement, in Santiagueño Quechua, it represents a future action. This can be compared to the modern Spanish phrase \"ir a\" which means \"to go\" + \"infinitive\" in Santiagueño Quechua.\n\nIt has been discovered that a new category of verb exists in this Quechua language: Pasado no experimentado, which adds a certain suffix to words to represent information that has been related to someone from another person. Usually, the suffix that corresponds to this is \"-ra\". Ex: \"niara\".\n\nThere are five vowel phonemes primarily used in this language: . In addition, as with other Quechuan languages, , and possess , and as allophones in the vicinity of the consonant phoneme . As opposed to other dialects of this language, which use the phoneme , Saniagueño Quechua possesses , similar to the Argentinian Spanish pronunciation of as .\n\nMany of the following examples have strong similarity to, or borrow words from the Spanish language.\n\n\n"}

In 1960, Wacław Sierpiński proved that there are infinitely many odd integers \"k\" which have this property.\n\nIn other words, when \"k\" is a Sierpiński number, all members of the following set are composite:\n\nNumbers in such a set with odd \"k\" and are Proth numbers.\n\nThe sequence of currently \"known\" Sierpiński numbers begins with:\n\nThe number 78557 was proved to be a Sierpiński number by John Selfridge in 1962, who showed that all numbers of the form have a factor in the covering set }. For another known Sierpiński number, 271129, the covering set is }. Most currently known Sierpiński numbers possess similar covering sets.\n\nHowever, in 1995 A. S. Izotov showed that some fourth powers could be proved to be Sierpiński numbers without establishing a covering set for all values of \"n\". His proof depends on the aurifeuillean factorization . This establishes that all give rise to a composite, and so it remains to eliminate only using a covering set.\n\nThe Sierpiński problem is: \"What is the smallest Sierpiński number?\"\n\nIn 1967, Sierpiński and Selfridge conjectured that 78,557 is the smallest Sierpiński number, and thus the answer to the Sierpiński problem.\n\nTo show that 78,557 really is the smallest Sierpiński number, one must show that all the odd numbers smaller than 78,557 are \"not\" Sierpiński numbers. That is, for every odd \"k\" below 78,557 there exists a positive integer \"n\" such that \"k\"2+1 is prime. , there are only five candidates:\nwhich have not been eliminated as possible Sierpiński numbers.\n\nIn 1976, Nathan Mendelsohn determined that the second provable Sierpiński number is the prime \"k = 271129\". The prime Sierpiński problem asks \"what is the smallest prime Sierpiński number\", and there is an ongoing \"Prime Sierpiński search\" which tries to prove that \"271129\" is the first Sierpiński number which is also a prime. The prime values of \"k\" less than \"271129\" for which a prime of the form \"k\"2+1 is not known are:\nThe first two, being less than 78557, are also unsolved cases of the (non-prime) Sierpiński problem described above.\n\nSuppose that both preceding Sierpiński problems had finally been solved, showing that 78557 is the smallest Sierpiński number and that 271129 is the smallest prime Sierpiński number. This still leaves unsolved the question of the \"second\" Sierpinski number; there could exist a composite Sierpiński number \"k\" such that formula_3. A ongoing search is trying to prove that 271129 is the second Sierpiński number, by testing all \"k\" values between 78557 and 271129, prime or not.\n\nSolving the extended Sierpiński problem, the most demanding of the three posed problems, requires the elimination of 23 remaining candidates formula_4, of which nine are prime (see above) and fourteen are composite. The latter include \"k\" = 21181, 24737, 55459 from the original Sierpiński problem, unique to the extended Sierpiński problem. , the following ten values of \"k\" remain:\n\nThe distributed volunteer computing project PrimeGrid is attempting to eliminate all the remaining values of \"k\". , no prime has been found for these values of \"k\" with formula_5.\n\nThe most recent elimination was in April 2018, when formula_6 was found to be prime by PrimeGrid, eliminating k=193997. The number is 3,447,670 digits long.\n\nA number may be simultaneously Sierpiński and Riesel. These are called Brier numbers. The smallest five known examples are 3316923598096294713661, 10439679896374780276373, 11615103277955704975673, 12607110588854501953787, 17855036657007596110949, ... ().\n\nIf we take the \"n\" of \"k\"2 + 1 to a negative integer, then the number become formula_7. If we choose the numerator, then the number become 2 + \"k\". Thus, a dual Sierpinski number is defined as an odd natural number \"k\" such that is composite for all natural numbers \"n\". There is a conjecture that the set of these numbers is the same as the set of Sierpinski numbers; for example, is composite for all natural numbers \"n\".\n\nThe least \"n\" such that is prime are (for odd \"k\"s)\n\nThe odd \"k\"s which are composite for all are\n\nThere is also a \"five or bust\", similar to seventeen or bust, considers this problem, and found (probable) primes for all (the largest prime is 2 + 40291), so it is currently known that 78557 is the smallest dual Sierpinski number.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "894421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=894421", "title": "Sociolect", "text": "Sociolect\n\nIn sociolinguistics, a sociolect or social dialect is a variety of language (a register) used by a socioeconomic class, a profession, an age group or other social group.\n\nSociolects involve both passive acquisition of particular communicative practices through association with a local community, as well as active learning and choice among speech or writing forms to demonstrate identification with particular groups.\n\nIndividuals who study sociolects are called sociolinguists. Sociolinguists study language variation. Sociolinguists define a sociolect by examining the social distribution of specific linguistic terms. For example, a sociolinguist would examine the use of the second person pronoun \"you\" for its use within the population. If one distinct social group used 'yous' as the plural form of the pronoun then this could indicate the existence of a sociolect. A sociolect is distinct from a dialect because social class rather than geographical subdivision substantiates the unique linguistic features.\n\nA sociolect, defined by Peter Trudgill, a leading sociolinguist and philosopher, is \"a variety or lect which is thought of as being related to its speakers' social background rather than geographical background\". This idea of sociolect began with the commencement of dialectology, the study of different dialects in relation to social society, which has been established in countries such as England for many years, but only recently has the field garnered more attention. However, as opposed to a dialect, the basic concept of a sociolect is that a person speaks in accordance with their social group whether it is with regard to one's ethnicity, age, gender, etc. As William Labov once said, \"the sociolinguistic view…is that we are programmed to learn to speak in ways that fit the general pattern of our communities\". Therefore, what we are surrounded with in unison with our environment determines how we speak; hence, our actions and associations.\n\nThe main distinction between a sociolect and a dialect, which are continually confused, is the settings in which it is created. A dialect's main identifier is geography: a certain region uses specific phonological, morphosyntactic or lexical rules. Asif Agha expands the concept by stating that \"the case where the demographic dimension marked by speech are matters of geographic provenance along, such as speaker's birth locale, extended residence and the like\". However, a sociolect's main identifier is a socioeconomic class, age, gender, and ethnicity in a certain speech community.\n\nAn example of a dialectal difference, based on region, is the use of the words soda or pop and coke in different parts of the United States. As Thomas E. Murray states, \"coke is used generically by thousands of people, especially in the southern half of the country.\" On the other hand, pop is known to be a term that is used by many citizens in the northern half of the country.\n\nAn example of a sociolect difference, based on social grouping, is the zero copula in African American Vernacular English. It occurs in a specific ethnic group but in all areas of the United States. William Labov gives an example: \"he here\" instead of \"he's here\".\n\nCode switching is \"the process whereby bilingual or bidialectal speakers switch back and forth between one language or dialect and another within the same conversation\".\n\nDiglossia, associated with the American linguist Charles A. Ferguson, which describes a sociolinguistic situation such as those that obtain in Arabic-speaking countries and in German-speaking Switzerland. In such a diglossic community, the prestigious standard of 'High'(or H) variety, which is linguistically related to but significantly different from the vernacular or 'Low' (or L) varieties, has no native speakers.\n\nDomain is \"different language, dialects, or styles are used in different social contexts\".\n\nLanguage attitudes are \"social in origin, but that they may have important effects on language behavior, being involved in acts of identity, and on linguistic change.\"\n\nLinguistic variable is \"a linguistic unit…initially developed...in order to be able to handle linguistics variation. Variables may be lexical and grammatical, but are most often phonological\". Example of British English (h) which is sometimes present and sometimes not.\n\nPragmatics is the meaning of a word in social context, while semantics has \"purely linguistic meaning\".\n\nRegister is \"a language variety that is associated with a particular topic, subject, or activity...\" Usually, it is defined by vocabulary, but has grammatical features as well.\n\nExample 1\n\nThe following is an example of the lexical distinction between the Mudaliyar and the Iyengar groups of the Tamil-speaking caste in India. The Iyengar group is part of the Brahmin caste which is scholarly and higher in the caste hierarchy than the non-Brahmin or Mudaliyar, caste. The Mudaliyars use many of the same words for things that are differentiated within the Iyengars' speech. For example, as you can see below, the difference between drinking water, water in general, and non-potable water is used by one word in the non-Brahmin caste and three separate words in the Brahmin caste. Furthermore, Agha references how the use of different speech reflects a \"departure from a group-internal norm\". For example, if the non-Brahmin caste uses Brahmin terms in their mode of speech it is seen as self-raising, whereas if people within the Brahmin caste use non-Brahmin speech it is seen as pejoratives. Therefore, depending on which castes use certain words the pragmatics change. Hence, this speech system is determined by socioeconomic class and social context.\n\nExample 2\n\nIn the following example, we see the difference between the national standard and the colloquial speech found in Norway where the phonology and pronunciation differ. As Agha states, \"Some lexical contrasts are due to the phonological difference (e.g., R makes more consonantal and vocalic distinctions than B), while others are due to the morphological difference (e.g., difference in plural suffixes and certain verb inflections) between two varieties.\n\nExample 3\n\nThe chart below gives an example of diglossia in Arab-speaking nations and where it is used. Diglossia is defined by Mesthrie as \"[a] situation where two varieties of a language exist side by side\". The Classical Arabic is known as الفصحى, or al-fuṣḥā, while the colloquial dialect depends on the country. For example, شامي, or šāmi, is spoken in Lebanon and parts of Syria. In many situations, there is a major lexical difference among words in the classical and colloquial speech, as well as pronunciation differences, such as a difference in short vowels, when the words are the same. Although a specific example of diglossia was not given, its social context is almost if not more important. For example, Halliday tells us that \"in areas with Diglossia, the link between language and success is apparent as the higher, classical register is learned through formal education\".\n\nExample 4\n\nBelow is an example of the addition of the verbal -s not just on 3rd person singular verbs in the present tense like in SAE, but added onto infinitives, first-person present verbs, and 3rd person past perfect verbs.\n\n\nFurther examples of the phenomenon in AAVE are provided below.\n\nBelow are examples of the lack of the possessive ending -s is usually absent in AAVE but contains a rule\nAs Labov shows states, \"[the] use -s to indicate possession by a single noun or pronoun, but never between the possessor and the possessed.\"\n\n\"This is hers, This is mines, This is John's, but not in her book, my book, John book\"\n\n\"Interview with Bryan A., seven years old, a struggling reader in a West Philadelphia elementary school: \n\nMany times within communities that contain sociolects that separate groups linguistically it is necessary to have a process where the independent speech communities can communicate in the same register; even if the change is as simple as different pronunciation. Therefore, the act of codeswitching becomes essential. Codeswitching is defined as \"the process whereby bilingual or bidialectal speakers switch back and forth between one language or dialect and another within the same conversation\". At times codeswitching can be situational, depending on the situation or topical, depending on the topic. Halliday terms this the best when he defines the role of discourse stating that \"it is this that determines, or rather correlates with, the role played by the language activity in the situation\". Therefore, meaning that which register is used depends on the situation and lays out the social context of the situation, because if the wrong register is used, then the wrong context is placed on the words. Furthermore, referring back to the diglossia expressed in the Arab-speaking world and the Tamil caste system in India, which words are used must be appropriate to not only the social class of the speaker, but the situation, the topic, and the need for courtesy. A more comprehensive definition is stated, \"Code-switching is not only a definition of the situation but an expression of social hierarchy.\"\n\nFor examples of the use of speech within certain situation refer back to the chart on Classical and Colloquial Arabic.\n\nFor examples of dialect selection based on topic, refer below:\n\nWhen Albania was created in 1912, the educational rights of the Greek communities in Albanian territory were granted by the Protocol of Corfu (1914) and with the statement of Albania's representatives in the League of Nations (1921). However, under a policy of assimilation, the Greek schools (there were over 360 until 1913) were gradually forced to close and Greek education was virtually eliminated by 1934. Following the intervention by the League of Nations, a limited number of schools, only those inside the \"official minority zones\", were reopened. \nEthnic Greeks living outside those areas were not counted as such. This has had a practical effect in the area of education: With the exception of the officially recognized Greek minority zones, where teaching was held in both the Greek and Albanian languages, in all other areas of Albania lessons were taught only in the Albanian language.If a few Albanian families moved into a town or village, the minority's right to be educated in Greek and publish in Greek newspapers was revoked.In accordance with the communist Albanian policy of unification and homogenization, the use of the Greek language in Himarë was forbidden in public, and many Greek-speaking people were forced to move to places in northern or central Albania.As a consequence, Greek schools in the Himarë area were closed, and the local communities stuck to their language, which slowly became archaic when they started to emigrate to Greece (1991) in the aftermath of the communist regime's collapse.\n\nAs Trudgill defines it, the Arvanikita is \"the name given in Greece given to the language of the indigenous Albanian-speaking linguistic minority in that country\". This community is different linguistically than the surrounding area and must use their language accordingly. For example, nowadays, Arvanitika is only used at home and other situations, such as in school during games, on the playground, or for \"chatting up girls\", while only Greek is spoken in class. \n\nTherefore, it is both topical and situational in context.\n\nHuman rights in Albania are violated by the Government which have targeted the Greek-speaking population via police and secret service according to Human Rights organisations.According to Amnesty International there were cases of mistreatment of members of the Greek-speaking minority by the authorities.Also, the Greek-speaking minority complained about the government’s unwillingness to recognize Greek-speaking towns outside communist-era “minority zones,” to utilize Greek in official documents and on public signs in Greek-speaking areas, or to include more ethnic Greeks in public administration.\nAlbanian sources often use the pejorative term 'filogrek' (pro-Greek) in relation to Greeks-speaking minority groups, usually in a context disputing their Greek ancestry.The 2012 USA annual report mention that the emergence of strident nationalist groups like the Red and Black Alliance (RBA) increased ethnic tensions with the Greek-speaking minority groups.\n\nThe Arvanitika community also suffers from discrimination because they are cast under stereotypes by the use of their native language. As Garrett writes, \"a number of Arvanites had suffered from what they regarded as discrimination, particularly during military service, and at school\". Even though, the language is the only thing that differentiates them from the surrounding Greeks, it still defines them as a distinct class and places them within a social hierarchy. \n\nFurthermore, within societies that maintain a diglossic state, the High ('H') and Low ('L') forms serve as a basis for discrimination. As Mesthrie writes, \"Since the H form is learned via formal education, diglossia can be a means of excluding people from access to full participation in society\".\n"}

It is a seriously endangered language; the strongholds of this language are the municipalities of Snåsa, Røyrvik, Røros and Hattfjelldal in Norway.\n\nSouthern Sami is one of the six Sami languages that has an official written language, but only a few books have been published for the language, one of which is an adequate-sized Southern Sami–Norwegian dictionary.\n\nSouthern Sami uses the Latin alphabet:\nThe Sami Language Council recommended in 1976 to use ⟨æ⟩ and ⟨ö⟩, but in practice the latter is replaced by ⟨ø⟩ in Norway and the former by ⟨ä⟩ in Sweden. This is in accordance with the usage in Norwegian and Swedish, based on computer or typewriter availability. The Ï ï represents a back version of I i, however many texts fail to distinguish between the two.\n\nC c, Q q, W w, X x, Z z are only used in words of foreign origin.\n\nSouthern Sami has two dialects, the northern and the southern dialect. The phonological differences between the dialects are relatively small; the phonemic system of the northern dialect is explained below.\n\nThe vowel phonemes of the northern dialect are the following; orthographic counterparts are given in italics:\n\nThe non-high vowels , , and contrast in length: they may occur as both short and long. High vowels only occur as short.\n\nThe vowels may combine to form ten different diphthongs:\n\nIn Southern Sami, the vowel in the second syllable of a word causes changes to the vowel in the first syllable, a feature called umlaut. The vowel in the second syllable can change depending on the inflectional ending being attached, and the vowel in the first vowel will likewise alternate accordingly. Often there are three different vowels that alternate with each other in the paradigm of a single word, for example as follows:\n\n\nThe following table gives a full overview of the alternations:\n\nOn the other hand, Southern Sami is the only Sami language that does not have consonant gradation. Hence consonants in the middle of words never alternate in Southern Sami, even though such alternations are frequent in other Sami languages. Compare, for instance, Southern Sami \"nomme\" 'name' : \"nommesne\" 'in the name' to Northern Sami \"namma\" : \"namas\", with the consonant gradation \"mm\" : \"m\".\n\nSouthern Sami has 8 cases:\n\nSouthern Sami verbs conjugate for three grammatical persons:\n\n\nSouthern Sami verbs conjugate for three grammatical numbers:\n\n\nSouthern Sami, like Finnish, the other Sami languages and Estonian, has a negative verb. In Southern Sami, the negative verb conjugates according to tense (past and non-past), mood (indicative and imperative), person (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and number (singular, dual and plural). This differs from some other Sami languages, e.g. from Northern Sami, which do not conjugate according to tense.\n\nLike Skolt Sami and unlike other Sami languages, Southern Sami is an SOV language.\n\n\n"}

It was presented to public in 1921 by the Berlin architect Tiemer as a pure literary language and should be used for automated translations. The idea was, that every concept is assigned by a number. The language shows similarities to the Dewey Decimal Classification by Melvil Dewey.\n\nOne of the only known sentences is the number-combination \"1-80-17\", which means \"I love you\". Here the 1 stands for \"I\", 17 for \"You\" and 80 for \"Love\". Alternatively, \"2\" can also be used as a description of \"you\" according to some forms. Thus, the number-combination would read \"1-80-2\". Given the basic concept that \"1\" equals \"I\", and that the designation starts from that viewpoint onwards, it is a logical alternative to accept \"2\" as another term for \"you\".\n\nThe comparative is shown by *, the superlative by ***. \"And\" is represented by +. A prefix of > makes a root an adjective. The genitive takes the suffix II, the dative takes III. “1-3̅0̅-(3)-9802” means, “I’ll write three letters”. “6215-8_0-164->1673-980” means, “The father loved the big coloured letters.”\nTenses were shown with an underscore below the number (past) or a macron above (future). The plural took superscript . Numbers when expressed in a numerical form appeared inside brackets. \n"}
{"id": "2452933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2452933", "title": "Vagrancy (biology)", "text": "Vagrancy (biology)\n\nVagrancy is a phenomenon in biology whereby individual animals appear well outside their normal range; individual animals which exhibit vagrancy are known as vagrants. The term accidental is sometimes also used. There are a number of factors which might cause an individual to become a vagrant—genetic factors and weather conditions are two—but the causes are overall poorly understood. Vagrancy can be a precursor to colonisation if individuals survive.\n\nVagrancy is known to occur in a wide range of animals such as birds, insects, mammals and sea turtles.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, adult birds (possibly inexperienced younger adults) of many species are known to continue past their normal breeding range during their spring migration and end up in areas further north (such birds are termed spring overshoots).\n\nIn autumn, some young birds, instead of heading to their usual wintering grounds, take \"incorrect\" courses and migrate through areas which are not on their normal migration path. For example, Siberian passerines which normally winter in Southeast Asia are commonly found in Northwest Europe, e.g. Arctic warblers in Britain. This is reverse migration, where the birds migrate in the opposite direction to that expected (say, flying north-west instead of south-east). The causes of this are unknown, but genetic mutation or other anomalies relating to the bird's magnetic sensibilities is suspected.\n\nOther birds are sent off course by storms, such as some North American birds blown across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. Birds can also be blown out to sea, become physically exhausted, land on a ship and end up being carried to the ship's destination.\n\nWhile many vagrant birds do not survive, if sufficient numbers wander to a new area they can establish new populations. Many isolated oceanic islands are home to species that are descended from landbirds blown out to sea, Hawaiian honeycreepers and Darwin's finches being prominent examples.\n\nVagrancy in insects is recorded from many groups—it is particularly well-studied in butterflies and moths, and dragonflies.\n\nIn mammals, vagrancy has been recorded for bats, pinniped seals, whales and manatees.\n\nVagrancy has been recorded for sea turtles, snakes (e.g. \"Pelamis platura\"), crocodilians, and probably also occurs in lizards. It therefore seems to be a fairly widespread phenomenon in reptiles. Saltwater crocodiles are especially prone to vagrancy, with individuals occasionally being recorded in odd places including Fiji, Iwo Jima, and even the Sea of Japan.\n\nThe term vagrant is also used of plants (e.g. Gleason and Cronquist, 1991), to refer to a plant that is growing far away from its species' usual range (especially north of its range) with the connotation of being a temporary population. In the context of lichens, a vagrant form or species occurs unattached to a substrate (\"loose\"), not necessarily outside its range.\n"}
{"id": "21304742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21304742", "title": "Validity (logic)", "text": "Validity (logic)\n\nIn logic, an argument is valid if and only if it takes a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false. It is not required that a valid argument have premises that are actually true, but to have premises that, if they were true, would guarantee the truth of the argument's conclusion. A formula is valid if and only if it is true under every interpretation, and an argument form (or schema) is valid if and only if every argument of that logical form is valid.\n\nAn argument is valid if and only if the truth of its premises entails the truth of its conclusion and each step, sub-argument, or logical operation in the argument is valid. Under such conditions it would be self-contradictory to affirm the premises and deny the conclusion. The corresponding conditional of a valid argument is a logical truth and the negation of its corresponding conditional is a contradiction. The conclusion is a logical consequence of its premises.\n\nAn argument that is not valid is said to be \"invalid\".\n\nAn example of a valid argument is given by the following well-known syllogism:\n\nWhat makes this a valid argument is not that it has true premises and a true conclusion, but the logical necessity of the conclusion, given the two premises. The argument would be just as valid were the premises and conclusion false. The following argument is of the same logical form but with false premises and a false conclusion, and it is equally valid:\n\nNo matter how the universe might be constructed, it could never be the case that these arguments should turn out to have simultaneously true premises but a false conclusion. The above arguments may be contrasted with the following invalid one:\n\nIn this case, the conclusion contradicts the deductive logic of the preceding premises, rather than deriving from it. Therefore, the argument is logically 'invalid', even though the conclusion could be considered 'true' in general terms. The premise 'All men are immortal' would likewise be deemed false outside of the framework of classical logic. However, within that system 'true' and 'false' essentially function more like mathematical states such as binary 1s and 0s than the philosophical concepts normally associated with those terms.\n\nA standard view is that whether an argument is valid is a matter of the argument's logical form. Many techniques are employed by logicians to represent an argument's logical form. A simple example, applied to two of the above illustrations, is the following: Let the letters 'P', 'Q', and 'S' stand, respectively, for the set of men, the set of mortals, and Socrates. Using these symbols, the first argument may be abbreviated as:\n\nSimilarly, the third argument becomes:\n\nAn argument is termed formally valid if it has structural self-consistency, i.e. if when the operands between premises are all true, the derived conclusion is always also true. In the third example, the initial premises cannot logically result in the conclusion and is therefore categorized as an invalid argument.\n\nA formula of a formal language is a valid formula if and only if it is true under every possible interpretation of the language. In propositional logic, they are tautologies.\n\nA statement can be called valid, i.e. logical truth, if it is true in all interpretations.\n\nValidity of deduction is not affected by the truth of the premise or the truth of the conclusion. The following deduction is perfectly valid:\n\nThe problem with the argument is that it is not \"sound\". In order for a deductive argument to be sound, the deduction must be valid and all the premises true.\n\nModel theory analyzes formulae with respect to particular classes of interpretation in suitable mathematical structures. On this reading, formula is valid if all such interpretations make it true. An inference is valid if all interpretations that validate the premises validate the conclusion. This is known as \"semantic validity\".\n\nIn truth-preserving validity, the interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true'.\n\nIn a false-preserving validity, the interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of 'false' produces a truth value of 'false'.\n\n\n"}
