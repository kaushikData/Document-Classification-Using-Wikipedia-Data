{"id": "236466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236466", "title": "Airborne early warning and control", "text": "Airborne early warning and control\n\nAn airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) system is an airborne radar picket system designed to detect aircraft, ships and vehicles at long ranges and perform command and control of the battlespace in an air engagement by directing fighter and attack aircraft strikes. AEW&C units are also used to carry out surveillance, including over ground targets and frequently perform C2BM (command and control, battle management) functions similar to an Air Traffic Controller given military command over other forces. When used at altitude, the radar on the aircraft allows the operators to detect and track targets and distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft much farther away than a similar ground-based radar. Like a ground-based radar, it can be detected by opposing forces, but because of its mobility, it is much less vulnerable to counter-attack.\n\nAEW&C aircraft are used for both defensive and offensive air operations, and are to the NATO and US forces trained or integrated Air Forces what the Command Information Center is to a US Navy warship, plus a highly mobile and powerful radar platform. The system is used offensively to direct fighters to their target locations, and defensively, directing counterattacks on enemy forces, both air and ground. So useful is the advantage of command and control from a high altitude, the United States Navy operates Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye AEW&C aircraft off its Supercarriers to augment and protect its carrier Command Information Centers (CICs). The designation \"airborne early warning\" (AEW) was used for earlier similar aircraft, such as the Fairey Gannet AEW.3 and Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, and continues to be used by the RAF for its Sentry AEW1, while AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) emphasizes the command and control capabilities that may not be present on smaller or simpler radar picket aircraft. AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) is the name of the specific system installed in the E-3 and Japanese Boeing E-767 AEW&C airframes, but is often used as a general synonym for AEW&C.\n\nModern AEW&C systems can detect aircraft from up to away, well out of range of most surface-to-air missiles. One AEW&C aircraft flying at can cover an area of . Three such aircraft in overlapping orbits can cover the whole of Central Europe. AEW&C systems communicate with friendly aircraft, vectoring fighters towards bogeys, providing data on threats and targets, help extend their sensor range and make offensive aircraft more difficult to track, since they no longer need to keep their own radar active to detect threats.\n\nAfter having developed Chain Home--the first ground-based early-warning radar detection system--in the 1930s, the British developed a radar set that could be carried on an aircraft for what they termed \"Air Controlled Interception\". The intention was to cover the North West approaches where German long range Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor aircraft were threatening shipping. A Vickers Wellington bomber (serial R1629) was fitted with a rotating antenna array. It was tested for use against aerial targets and then for possible use against German E boats. Another radar equipped Wellington with a different installation was used to direct Bristol Beaufighters toward Heinkel He 111s, which were air-launching V-1 flying bombs.\n\nIn February 1944, the U.S. Navy ordered the development of a radar system that could be carried aloft in an aircraft under Project Cadillac. A prototype system was built and flown in August on a modified TBM Avenger torpedo bomber. Tests proved successful, with the system being able to detect low flying formations at a range in excess of . The U.S. Navy then ordered production of the TBM-3W, the first production AEW aircraft to enter service. TBM-3Ws fitted with the AN/APS-20 radar entered service in March 1945, with some 36–40 eventually being constructed.\n\nThe Lockheed WV and EC-121 Warning Star, which first flew in 1949 served widely with both the US Air Force and US Navy and provided the main AEW coverage for US forces during the Vietnam war. It was to remain operational until replaced with the E-3 AWACS, its intended successor. Developed roughly in parallel, N-class blimps were also used as AEW aircraft, filling in gaps in radar coverage for the continental US, their tremendous endurance of over 200 hours being a major asset in an AEW aircraft, although lighter than air operations were discontinued in 1962 following a crash.\n\nIn 1958, the Soviet Tupolev Design Bureau was also ordered to design an AEW aircraft. After determining that the projected radar instrumentation wouldn't fit in a Tupolev Tu-95 or a Tupolev Tu-116, the decision was made to use the more capacious Tupolev Tu-114 instead. This solved the problems with cooling and operator space that existed with the narrower Tu-95 and Tu-116 fuselage. To meet the flight range requirements, production examples were fitted with an air-to-air refueling probe. The resulting system, the Tupolev Tu-126, entered service in 1965 with the Soviet Air Forces and remained in service until replaced by the Beriev A-50 in 1984.\n\nMany countries have developed their own AEW&C systems, although the Boeing E-3 Sentry and Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye are the most common systems worldwide. The E-3 Sentry was built by the Boeing Defense and Space Group (now Boeing Defense, Space & Security) and was based on the Boeing 707-320 aircraft. Sixty-five E-3s were built and it is operated by the United States, NATO, the United Kingdom, France, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe specially designed Grumman E-2 Hawkeye entered service in 1965 and has been operated by eight different nations. Over 168 have been produced so far and new versions continue to be developed, making it the most widely used AEW system. For the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, the E-3 technology has been fitted into the Boeing E-767.\n\nAfter World War 2, the United Kingdom deployed a substantial AEW capability with American Douglas AD-4W Skyraiders, designated Skyraider AEW.1, which in turn were replaced by the Fairey Gannet AEW.3, using the same AN/APS-20 radar. With the retirement of the conventional aircraft carriers, the Gannet was withdrawn and the Royal Air Force (RAF) installed the radars from the Gannets on Avro Shackleton MR.2 airframes, redesignated Shackleton AEW.2. To replace the Shackleton AEW.2, an AEW variant of the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, known as the Nimrod AEW3, was ordered in 1974. However, after a protracted and problematic development, this was cancelled in 1986, and seven E-3Ds, designated Sentry AEW.1 in RAF service, were purchased instead.\n\nThe Russian Air Force is currently using around 15–20 Beriev A-50 and A-50U \"Shmel\" in the AEW role. The \"Mainstay\" is based on the Ilyushin Il-76 airframe, with a large non-rotating disk radome on the rear fuselage. These replaced the 12 Tupolev Tu-126 that filled the role previously. The A-50 and A-50U will eventually be replaced by the Beriev A-100, which features an AESA array in the radome and is based on the updated Il-476.\n\nIn May 1997, Russia and Israel agreed to jointly fulfill an order from China to develop and deliver an early warning system. China reportedly ordered one Phalcon for $250 million, which entailed retrofitting a Russian-made Ilyushin-76 cargo plane [also incorrectly reported as a Beriev A-50 Mainstay] with advanced Elta electronic, computer, radar and communications systems. Beijing was expected to acquire several PHALCON AEW systems, and reportedly could buy at least three more [and possibly up to eight] of these systems, the prototype of which was planned for testing beginning in 2000. Finally, in July 2000 the United States pressured Israel to back out of the $1 billion agreement to sell China four Phalcon phased-array radar systems. Following the cancelled A-50I/Phalcon deal, China turned to indigenous solutions. The Phalcon radar and other electronic systems were taken off from the unfinished Il-76, and the airframe was handed to China via Russia in 2002. The Chinese AWACS has a unique phased array radar (PAR) carried in a round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their rotodomes to give a 360 degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a triangular configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360 degree coverage. The installation of equipment at the Il-76 began in late 2002 aircraft by Xian aircraft industries (Xian Aircraft Industry Co.). The first flight of an airplane KJ-2000 made in November 2003. All four machines will be equipped with this type. The last to be introduced into service the Chinese Air Force until the end of 2007.<ref name=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/kj-2000.htm\"></ref>\n\nIn 2003, the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) began a study of requirements for developing an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWAC) system. In 2015, DRDO delivered 3 AWACs, called Netra, to the air force with indigenous radar systems built on the Brazilian Embraer EMB-145 air frame. Netra gives a 240-degree coverage of airspace.The Emb-145 also has air-to-air refuelling capability for longer surveillance time.The Indian Air Force also operates three Israeli EL/W-2090 systems (Il-76/Phalcon system deal canceled for China), the first of which first arrived on May 25, 2009. India subsequently signed with Israel to pick up the A-50I instead of China, therefore, A50I adopted the 3-radar arrangement designed by Chinese team. The DRDO is now developing a more advanced AWACS with a longer range and with a 360-degree coverage akin to the Phalcon system, based on the Airbus A-330 airframe.\n\nThe Royal Australian Air Force, Republic of Korea Air Force and the Turkish Air Force are deploying Boeing 737 AEW&C aircraft. Unlike the E-2 and E-3, the Boeing 737 AEW&C does not use a rotating disk radome (rotodome) but instead has a large dorsal fin.\n\nThe Swedish Air Force uses the S 100B Argus as its AEW platform. The S 100B Argus is based on the Saab 340 with an Ericsson Erieye PS-890 radar.\n\nThe Hellenic Air Force, Brazilian Air Force and Mexican Air Force use the Embraer R-99 with an Ericsson Erieye PS-890 radar, as on the S 100B.\n\nIn early 2006, the Pakistan Air Force ordered six Erieye AEW equipped Saab 2000 from Sweden. In December 2006, the Pakistan Navy requested three excess P-3 Orion aircraft to be equipped with Hawkeye 2000 AEW systems. China and Pakistan also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the joint development of AEW&C systems.\n\nIsrael has developed the IAI/Elta EL/M-2075 Phalcon system, which uses an AESA (active electronically scanned array) in lieu of a rotodome antenna. The system was the first such system to enter service. The original Phalcon was mounted on a Boeing 707 and developed for the Israeli Defense Force and for export.\n\nThe British Sea King ASaC7 naval helicopter was operated from \"Invincible\"-class aircraft carriers. The creation of Sea King ASaC7, and earlier AEW.2 and AEW.5 was the consequence of lessons learnt by the Royal Navy during the 1982 Falklands War when the lack of AEW coverage for the task force was a major tactical handicap, and left them vulnerable to low level attack. The Spanish Navy fields the SH-3 Sea King in the same role, operated from the LPH \"Juan Carlos I\"\".\"\n\nThe AgustaWestland EH-101A AEW of the Italian Navy is operated from the aircraft carriers \"Cavour\" and \"Garibaldi\". In 2018 the British will replace their Sea Kings with a modular \"Crowsnest\" system that can be fitted to any of their Merlin HM2 fleet.\n\nThe Russian-built Kamov Ka-31 is deployed by the Indian Navy on the aircraft carrier INS \"Vikramaditya\" and \"Talwar\"-class frigates and will be deployed on the Vikrant-class aircraft carriers. The Russian Navy has two Ka-31R variants, at least one of which was deployed on their aircraft carrier \"Kuznetsov\" in 2016. It is fitted with E-801M Oko (Eye) airborne electronic warfare radar that can track 20 targets simultaneously, detecting aircraft up to away, and surface warships up to distant.\n\nBoeing produces a specific system with a rotating radar dome 'rotodome' radome designed and built by Boeing (Defense & Space Group) using Westinghouse (now Northrop Grumman) radar. It is mounted on either the E-3 Sentry aircraft (Boeing 707) or more recently the Boeing E-767 (Boeing 767), the latter only being used by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.\nWhen AWACS first entered service it represented a major advance in capability, being the first AEW to use a pulse-Doppler radar, which allowed it to track targets normally lost in ground clutter. Previously, low-flying aircraft could only be readily tracked over water.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "870045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=870045", "title": "Ayaan Hirsi Ali", "text": "Ayaan Hirsi Ali\n\nAyaan Hirsi Ali (; ; born Ayaan Hirsi Magan, 13 November 1969) is a Somali-born Dutch-American activist, feminist, author, scholar and former politician. She received international attention as a critic of Islam and advocate for the rights and self-determination of Muslim women, actively opposing forced marriage, honor violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation. She has founded an organisation for the defense of women's rights, the AHA Foundation.\n\nAyaan Hirsi Ali is a Fellow with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, a Fellow with the Future of Diplomacy Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at The Harvard Kennedy School, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn 2003, Hirsi Ali was elected a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the States General of the Netherlands, representing the centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). A political crisis related to the validity of her Dutch citizenship—namely the accusation that she had lied on her application for political asylum—led to her resignation from parliament, and indirectly to the fall of the second Balkenende cabinet in 2006.\n\nHirsi Ali, a former Muslim who abandoned her faith and became an atheist, has been a vocal critic of Islam. In 2004, she collaborated on a short movie with Theo van Gogh, entitled \"Submission\", a film depicting oppression of women under fundamentalist Islamic law, critical of the Islamic canon itself. The film sparked controversy and death threats. Van Gogh was murdered later that year by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Moroccan-Dutch Islamic terrorist. Hirsi Ali maintains that \"Islam is part religion, and part a political-military doctrine, the part that is a political doctrine contains a world view, a system of laws and a moral code that is totally incompatible with our constitution, our laws, and our way of life.\" Having previously argued that Islam was beyond reform, in her latest book \"Heretic\" (2015) she calls for a reformation of Islam by defeating the Islamists and supporting reformist Muslims.\n\nIn 2005, Hirsi Ali was named by \"Time\" magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. She has also received several awards, including a free speech award from the Danish newspaper \"Jyllands-Posten\", the Swedish Liberal Party's Democracy Prize, and the Moral Courage Award for commitment to conflict resolution, ethics, and world citizenship. Critics accuse Ali of having built her political career on denigrating Islam and Muslims, and questioned her scholarly credentials \"to speak authoritatively about Islam and the Arab world\". Her works are accused of using neo-Orientalist portrayals and of being an enactment of the colonial \"civilizing mission\" discourse.\n\nHirsi Ali emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. citizen in 2013. Hirsi Ali has published two autobiographies: in 2006 and 2010. She is married to British historian and public commentator Niall Ferguson.\n\nAyaan was born in 1969 in Mogadishu, Somalia. Her father, Hirsi Magan Isse, was a prominent member of the Somali Salvation Democratic Front and a leading figure in the Somalian Revolution. Shortly after she was born, her father was imprisoned due to his opposition to the Siad Barre government. Hirsi Ali's father had studied abroad and was opposed to female genital mutilation, but while he was imprisoned, Hirsi Ali's grandmother had a man perform the procedure on her, when Hirsi Ali was five years old. According to Hirsi Ali, she was fortunate that her grandmother could not find a woman to do the procedure, as the mutilation was \"much milder\" when performed by men.\n\nAfter her father escaped from prison, he and the family left Somalia in 1977, going to Saudi Arabia and then to Ethiopia, before settling in Nairobi, Kenya by 1980. There he established a comfortable upper-class life for them. Hirsi Ali attended the English-language Muslim Girls' Secondary School. By the time she reached her teens, Saudi Arabia was funding religious education in numerous countries and its religious views were becoming influential among many Muslims. A charismatic religious teacher, trained under this aegis, joined Hirsi Ali's school. She inspired the teenaged Ayaan, as well as some fellow students, to adopt the more rigorous Saudi Arabian interpretations of Islam, as opposed to the more relaxed versions then current in Somalia and Kenya. Hirsi Ali said later that she had long been impressed by the Qur'an and had lived \"by the Book, for the Book\" throughout her childhood.\n\nShe sympathised with the views of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, and wore a \"hijab\" with her school uniform. This was unusual at the time but has become more common among some young Muslim women. At the time, she agreed with the \"fatwa\" proclaimed against British Indian writer Salman Rushdie in reaction to the portrayal of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in his novel \"The Satanic Verses\". After completing secondary school, Hirsi Ali attended a secretarial course at Valley Secretarial College in Nairobi for one year. As she was growing up, she also read English-language adventure stories, such as the Nancy Drew series, with modern heroine archetypes who pushed the limits of society.\nAlso, remembering her grandmother refusing soldiers entry into her house, Hirsi Ali associated with Somalia \"the picture of strong women: the one who smuggles in the food, and the one who stands there with a knife against the army and says, 'You cannot come into the house.' And I became like that. And my parents and my grandmother don't appreciate that now - because of what I've said about the Qur'an. I have become them, just in a different way.\"\n\nHirsi Ali arrived in the Netherlands in 1992. That year she had travelled from Kenya to visit her family in Düsseldorf and Bonn, Germany and gone to the Netherlands to escape an alleged arranged marriage. Once there, she requested political asylum and obtained a residence permit. She used her paternal grandfather's early surname on her application and has since been known in the West as Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She received a residence permit within three or four weeks of arriving in the Netherlands.\n\nAt first she held various short-term jobs, ranging from cleaning to sorting post. She worked as a translator at a Rotterdam refugee center which, according to a friend interviewed in 2006 by \"The Observer\" newspaper, marked her deeply.\n\nAs an avid reader, in the Netherlands she found new books and ways of thought that both stretched her imagination and frightened her. Sigmund Freud's work introduced her to an alternative moral system that was not based on religion. During this time she took courses in Dutch and a one-year introductory course in social work at the De Horst Institute for Social Work in Driebergen. She has said that she was impressed with how well Dutch society seemed to function. To better understand its development, she studied at Leiden University, obtaining an MSc degree in political science in 2000.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2001, Hirsi Ali also worked as an independent Somali-Dutch interpreter and translator, frequently working with Somali women in asylum centers, hostels for abused women, and at the Dutch immigration and naturalization service (IND, Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst). While working for the IND, she became critical of the way it handled asylum seekers. As a result of her education and experiences, Hirsi Ali speaks six languages: English, Somali, Arabic, Swahili, Amharic, and Dutch.\n\nAfter gaining her degree, Hirsi Ali became a fellow at the Wiardi Beckman Stichting (WBS), a think tank of the center-left Labour Party (PvdA). Leiden University Professor Ruud Koole was steward of the party. Hirsi Ali's writing at the WBS was inspired by the work of the neoconservative Orientalist Bernard Lewis.\n\nShe became disenchanted with Islam, and was shocked by the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, for which al-Qaeda eventually claimed responsibility. After listening to videotapes of Osama bin Laden citing \"words of justification\" in the Qur'an for the attacks, she wrote, \"I picked up the Qur'an and the hadith and started looking through them, to check. I hated to do it, because I knew that I would find Bin Laden's quotations in there.\" During this time of transition, she came to regard the Qur'an as relative – it was a historical record and \"just another book.\"\n\nReading \"Atheïstisch manifest\" (\"Atheist Manifesto\") of Leiden University philosopher Herman Philipse helped to convince her to give up religion. She renounced Islam and acknowledged her disbelief in God in 2002. She began to formulate her critique of Islam and Islamic culture, published many articles on these topics, and became a frequent speaker on television news programs and in public debate forums. She discussed her ideas at length in a book entitled \"De Zoontjesfabriek\" (\"The Son Factory\") (2002). In this period, she first began to receive death threats.\n\nIn November 2002, after disagreements with the PvdA about what security measures they would offer her as a member, she sought advice from Cisca Dresselhuys, the editor of the feminist magazine \"Opzij,\" on how to gain government funding for what was essentially political protection.\n\nDresselhuys introduced Hirsi Ali to Gerrit Zalm, the parliamentary leader of the center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), and party member Neelie-Smit Kroes, then European Commissioner for Competition. At their urging, Hirsi Ali agreed to switch to their party of the VVD and stood for election to Parliament. Between November 2002 and January 2003, she lived abroad while on the payroll as an assistant of the VVD.\n\nIn 2003, aged 33, Hirsi Ali became a prominent candidate in the parliamentary election campaign. She said that the Dutch welfare state had overlooked abuse of Muslim women and girls in the Netherlands and their social needs, contributing to their isolation and oppression. She won her seat.\n\nDuring her tenure in Parliament, Hirsi Ali continued her criticisms of Islam and many of her statements provoked controversy. In an interview in the Dutch newspaper \"Trouw\", she said that by Western standards, Muhammad as represented in the Qu'ran would be considered a pedophile. A religious discrimination complaint was filed against her on 24 April 2003 by Muslims who objected to her statements. The Prosecutor's office decided not to initiate a case, because her critique did \"not put forth any conclusions in respect to Muslims and their worth as a group is not denied\".\n\nWorking with writer and director Theo van Gogh, Hirsi Ali wrote the script and provided the voice-over for \"Submission\" (2004), a short film that criticised the treatment of women in Islamic society. Juxtaposed with passages from the Qur'an were scenes of actresses portraying Muslim women suffering abuse. An apparently nude actress dressed in a semi-transparent \"burqa\" was shown with texts from the Qur'an written on her skin. These texts are among those often interpreted as justifying the subjugation of Muslim women. The film's release sparked outrage among many Dutch Muslims.\n\nMohammed Bouyeri, a 26-year-old Dutch Moroccan Islamist and member of the Muslim terrorist organisation Hofstad Group, assassinated van Gogh in an Amsterdam street on 2 November 2004. Bouyeri shot van Gogh with a handgun eight times, first from a distance and then at short range as the director lay wounded on the ground. He was already dead when Bouyeri cut his throat with a large knife and tried to decapitate him. Bouyeri left a letter pinned to Van Gogh's body with a small knife; it was primarily a death threat to Hirsi Ali. The Dutch secret service immediately raised the level of security they provided to Hirsi Ali. Bouyeri was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\n\nIn 2004 a rap song about Hirsi Ali was produced and distributed on the Internet. The lyrics included violent threats against her life. The rappers were prosecuted under Article 121 of the Dutch criminal code because they hindered Hirsi Ali's execution of her work as a politician. In 2005 they were sentenced to community service and a suspended prison sentence.\n\nHirsi Ali went into hiding, aided by government security services, who moved her among several locations in the Netherlands. They moved her to the United States for several months. On 18 January 2005, she returned to parliament. On 18 February 2005, she revealed where she and her colleague Geert Wilders were living. She demanded a normal, secured house, which she was granted one week later.\n\nIn January 2006 Hirsi Ali was recognised as \"European of the Year\" by \"Reader's Digest,\" an American magazine. In her speech, she urged action to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. She also said that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should be taken at his word in wanting to organise a conference to investigate objective evidence of the Holocaust, noting that the subject is not taught in the Middle East. She said, \"Before I came to Europe, I'd never heard of the Holocaust. That is the case with millions of people in the Middle East. Such a conference should be able to convince many people away from their denial of the genocide against the Jews.\" She also said that what some have described as \"Western values\" of freedom and justice were universal. But she thought that Europe has done far better than most areas of the world in providing justice, as it has guaranteed the freedom of thought and debate required for critical self-examination. She said communities cannot reform unless \"scrupulous investigation of every former and current doctrine is possible.\" Hirsi Ali was nominated as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize the same month by Norwegian parliamentarian Christian Tybring-Gjedde.\n\nIn March 2006 she co-signed a letter entitled \"\". Among the eleven other signatories was Salman Rushdie; as a teenager, Hirsi Ali had supported the fatwa against him. The letter was published in response to protests in the Islamic world surrounding the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark, and it supported freedom of press and freedom of expression.\n\nOn 27 April 2006 a Dutch judge ruled that Hirsi Ali had to abandon her current secure house at a secret address in the Netherlands. Her neighbors had complained that she created an unacceptable security risk, but the police had testified that this neighborhood was one of the safest places in the country, as they had many personnel assigned to it for Hirsi Ali's protection. In an interview in early 2007, Hirsi Ali noted that the Dutch state had spent about €3.5 million on her protection; threats against her produced fear, but she believed it important to speak her mind. While regretting van Gogh's death, she said she was proud of their work together.\n\nA private trust, the Foundation for Freedom of Expression, was established in 2007 in the Netherlands to help fund protection of Ayaan Hirsi Ali and other Muslim dissidents.\n\nIn May 2006 the TV programme \"Zembla\" reported that Hirsi Ali had given false information about her name, her age, and her country of residence when originally applying for asylum. In her asylum application, she had claimed to be fleeing a forced marriage, but the \"Zembla\" coverage featured interviews with her family, who denied that claim. The program alleged that, contrary to Hirsi Ali's claims of having fled a Somali war zone, the MP had been living comfortably in upper middle-class conditions safely in Kenya with her family for at least 12 years before she sought refugee status in the Netherlands in 1992.\n\nIn her version of events, she had fled civil war in Somalia, was forced into an arranged marriage with a man whom she had never met, and was not present at her own wedding. Upon escaping she was forced into hiding in the Netherlands, for her ex-husband and father's brothers would have been by Somali custom, required to perform an honor killing. The accounts of various witnesses varied greatly from hers. According to them, she left Somalia prior to any mass violence, and led a comfortable, upper-middle class life in neighboring Kenya, where she attended a Muslim Girls' school and received a full western-style education with focus on the Humanities and Science, her brother attended a Christian school, she lied to the Dutch immigration service about coming from Somalia in order not to be sent back to Kenya, and they allege she met her husband a few days before her wedding. After several meetings with him, they allege she agreed to the marriage, even though her mother said Ayaan should finish her education so she could afford to leave him if the marriage should prove unsuccessful. They also allege that Hirsi Ali was present at the wedding, something her brother later denied, and according to several witnesses appeared to be enjoying herself. Hirsi Ali denies all of this. On her way to Canada, she says she travelled to Holland by train during a stopover in Germany, and applied for political asylum. During her stay in Holland she regularly received letters from her father. The documentary also quoted several native Somalians as saying there is no tradition of honor killing in Somalia, something that is disputed.\n\nHirsi Ali admitted that she had lied about her full name, date of birth, and the manner in which she had come to the Netherlands, but persisted in saying she was trying to flee a forced marriage. She noted that her first book, \"The Son Factory\" (2002), provided her real name and date of birth. She had also stated these in a September 2002 interview published in the political magazine \"HP/De Tijd\". and in an interview in the \"VARA gids\" (2002). Hirsi Ali asserted in her 2006 autobiography (2007 in English) that she made full disclosure of the matter to VVD officials when invited to run for parliament in 2002. It is not known on what grounds she received political asylum. On the issue of her name, she applied under her grandfather's surname in her asylum application, to which she was entitled; she later said it was to escape retaliation by her clan. In the later parliamentary investigation of Hirsi Ali's immigration, the Dutch law governing names was reviewed. An applicant may legally use a surname derived from any generation as far back as the grandparent. Therefore, Hirsi Ali's application, though against clan custom of names, was legal under Dutch law. The question of her age was of minor concern. Media speculation arose in 2006 that she could lose her Dutch citizenship because of these issues, rendering her ineligible for parliament. At first, Minister Rita Verdonk said she would not look into the matter. She later decided to investigate Hirsi Ali's naturalisation process. The investigation found that Hirsi Ali had not legitimately received Dutch citizenship, because she had lied about her name and date of birth. However, later inquiries established that she was entitled to use the name Ali because it was her grandfather's name. Rita Verdonk moved to annul Hirsi Ali's citizenship, an action later overridden at the urging of Parliament.\n\nOn 15 May 2006, after the broadcast of the \"Zembla\" documentary, news stories appeared saying that Hirsi Ali was likely to move to the United States that September. She was reported to be planning to write a book entitled \"Shortcut to Enlightenment\" and to work for the American Enterprise Institute. On 16 May Hirsi Ali resigned from Parliament after admitting that she had lied on her asylum application. In a press conference she said that the facts had been publicly known since 2002, when they had been reported in the media and in one of her publications. She also restated her claim of seeking asylum to prevent a forced marriage, stating: \"How often do people who are seeking refuge provide different names? The penalty of stripping me of my Dutch citizenship is disproportional.\" Her stated reason for resigning immediately was the increasing media attention. Owing to the fact that a Dutch court had ruled in April 2006 that she had to leave her house by August 2006, she decided to relocate to the United States in September 2006.\n\nAfter a long and emotional debate in the Dutch Parliament, all major parties supported a motion requesting the Minister to explore the possibility of special circumstances in Hirsi Ali's case. Although Verdonk remained convinced that the applicable law did not leave her room to consider such circumstances, she decided to accept the motion. During the debate, she said that Hirsi Ali still had Dutch citizenship during the period of reexamination. Apparently the \"decision\" she had announced had represented the current position of the Dutch government. Hirsi Ali at that point had six weeks to react to the report before any final decision about her citizenship was taken. Verdonk was strongly criticised for her actions in such a sensitive case. In addition to her Dutch passport, Hirsi Ali retained a Dutch residency permit based on being a political refugee. According to the Minister, this permit could not be taken away from her since it had been granted more than 12 years before.\n\nReacting to news of Hirsi Ali's planned relocation to the US, former VVD leader Hans Wiegel stated that her departure \"would not be a loss to the VVD and not be a loss to the House of Representatives\". He said that Hirsi Ali was a brave woman, but that her opinions were polarizing. Former parliamentary leader of the VVD, Jozias van Aartsen, said that it is \"painful for Dutch society and politics that she is leaving the House of Representatives\". Another VVD MP, Bibi de Vries, said that if something were to happen to Hirsi Ali, some people in her party would have \"blood on their hands.\" United States Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick said in May 2006, \"we recognise that she is a very courageous and impressive woman and she is welcome in the US.\"\n\nOn 23 May 2006, Ayaan Hirsi made available to \"The New York Times\" some letters she believed would provide insight into her 1992 asylum application. In one letter her sister Haweya warned her that the entire extended family was searching for her (after she had fled to the Netherlands), and in another letter her father denounced her. Christopher DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), said that the asylum controversy would not affect the appointment. He stated that he was still looking forward to \"welcoming her to AEI, and to America.\"\n\nOn 27 June 2006, the Dutch government announced that Hirsi Ali would keep her Dutch citizenship. On the same day a letter was disclosed in which Hirsi Ali expressed regret for misinforming Minister Verdonk. Hirsi Ali was allowed to retain her name. Dutch immigration rules allowed asylum seekers to use grandparents' names. Her grandfather had used the last name Ali until his thirties and then switched to Magan, which was her father's and family's surname. This grandfather's birth year of 1845 had complicated the investigation. (Hirsi Ali's father Hirsi Magan Isse was the youngest of his many children and born when her grandfather was close to 90). Later the same day Hirsi Ali, through her lawyer and in television interviews, stated that she had signed the resignation letter, drafted by the Justice Department, under duress. She felt it was forced in order for her to keep her passport, but she had not wanted to complicate her pending visa application for the U.S. she still carried her Dutch passport.\n\nIn a special parliamentary session on 28 June 2006, questions were raised about these issues. The ensuing political upheaval on 29 June ultimately led to the fall of the Second Balkenende cabinet.\n\nIn 2006 Hirsi Ali took a position at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.; as the Dutch government continued to provide security for her, this required an increase in their effort and costs.\n\nHer high public profile and outspokenness continued to attract controversy. On 17 April 2007, the local Muslim community in Johnstown, Pennsylvania protested Hirsi Ali's planned lecture at the local campus of the University of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh imam Fouad El Bayly was reported as saying that the activist deserved the death sentence but should be tried and judged in an Islamic country.\n\nOn 25 September 2007, Hirsi Ali received her United States Permanent Resident Card (green card). In October 2007 she returned to the Netherlands, continuing her work for AEI from a secret address in the Netherlands. The Dutch minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin had informed her of his ruling that, as of 1 October 2007, the Dutch government would no longer pay for her security abroad. That year she declined an offer to live in Denmark, saying she intended to return to the United States.\n\nIn early 2014 Brandeis University in Massachusetts announced that Ali would be given an honorary degree at the graduation commencement ceremony. In early April, the university rescinded its offer following a review of her statements that was carried out in response to protests by the Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) and lobbying by Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Head of the Islamic Studies Department, other faculty members and several student groups that accused Hirsi Ali of \"hate speech\". University president Frederick M. Lawrence said that \"certain of her past statements\" were inconsistent with the university's \"core values\" because they were \"Islamophobic.\" Others expressed opinions both for and against this decision. The university said she was welcome to come to the campus for a dialogue in the future.\n\nThe university's withdrawal of its invitation generated controversy and condemnation among some. But, \"The Economist\" noted at the time that Hirsi Ali's \"Wholesale condemnations of existing religions just aren't done in American politics.\" It said that \"The explicit consensus in America is ecumenical and strongly pro-religious ...\" The university was distinguishing between an open intellectual exchange, which could occur if Hirsi Ali came to campus for a dialogue, and appearing to celebrate her with an honorary degree.\n\nA Brandeis spokesperson said that Ali had not been invited to speak at commencement but simply to be among honorary awardees. She claimed to have been invited to speak and expressed shock at Brandeis' action. Hirsi Ali said CAIR's letter misrepresented her and her work, but that it has long been available on the Internet. She said that the \"spirit of free expression\" has been betrayed and stifled.\n\nDavid Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University, criticised the Brandeis decision as an attack on academic values of freedom of inquiry and intellectual independence.\n\nAmong the commenters, Jeffrey Herf, a Brandeis alumnus and historian, published an open letter criticizing Lawrence's decision, saying it had \"done deep and long-lasting damage to a university.\" Lawrence J. Haas, the former communications director and press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, published an open letter saying that Lawrence \"succumbed to political correctness and interest group pressure in deciding that Islam is beyond the pale of legitimate inquiry ... that such a decision is particularly appalling for a university president, for a campus is precisely the place to encourage free discussion even on controversial matters.\"\n\nIn October 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center accused Ayaan, and the liberal Muslim reformer Maajid Nawaz, of being \"anti-Muslim extremists\", which caused protests in several prominent newspapers. The Lantos Foundation for Human Rights & Justice wrote a public letter to the SPLC asking them to retract the listings.\n\nIn April, 2018, the SPLC retracted the \"Anti-Muslim Extremist\" List in its entirety after Nawaz threatened legal action over his inclusion on the list. In June 2018 the SPLC settled with Nawaz, paying him $3.375 million USD to drop the case.\n\nIn April 2017 she cancelled a planned tour of Australia. This followed the Facebook release of a video by six Australian Muslim women who accused her of being a \"star of the global Islamophobia industry\" and of profiting from \"an industry that exists to dehumanize Muslim women\" but did not call for her to cancel her trip. Ali responded that the women in question were \"carrying water\" for the causes of radical Islamists and stated that \"Islamophobia\" is a manufactured word. She explained that the cancellation was due to security concerns and organisational problems.\n\nHirsi Ali joined the VVD political party in 2002; it combines \"classically liberal\" views on the economy, foreign policy, crime and immigration with a liberal social stance on abortion and homosexuality. She says that she admires Frits Bolkestein, a former Euro-commissioner and ideological leader of the party.\n\nHirsi Ali is the founder and president of the AHA Foundation, a non-profit humanitarian organisation to protect women and girls in the U.S. against political Islam and harmful tribal customs that violate U.S. law and international conventions. Through the AHA Foundation, Hirsi Ali campaigns against the denial of education for girls, female genital mutilation, forced marriage, honour violence and killings, and suppression of information about the crimes through the misuse and misinterpretation of rights to freedom of religion and free speech in the U.S. and the West.\n\nHirsi Ali has criticised the treatment of women in Islamic societies and the punishments demanded by conservative Islamic scholars for homosexuality and adultery. She publicly identified as Muslim until 28 May 2002, when she acknowledged in her diary that she knew she was not.\n\nIn a 2007 interview in the London \"Evening Standard\", Hirsi Ali characterised Islam as \"the new fascism\":\n\nJust like Nazism started with Hitler's vision, the Islamic vision is a caliphate – a society ruled by Sharia law – in which women who have sex before marriage are stoned to death, homosexuals are beaten, and apostates like me are killed. Sharia law is as inimical to liberal democracy as Nazism ... Violence is inherent in Islam – it's a destructive, nihilistic cult of death. It legitimates murder.\n\nIn a 2007 article in \"Reason\" magazine, Hirsi Ali said that Islam, the religion, must be defeated and that \"we are at war with Islam. And there's no middle ground in wars.\" She said, \"Islam, period. Once it's defeated, it can mutate into something peaceful. It's very difficult to even talk about peace now. They're not interested in peace ... There comes a moment when you crush your enemy.\" She reiterated her position that the problem isn't just a few \"rotten apples\" in the Islamic community but \"I'm saying it's the entire basket.\" She stated that the majority of Muslims aren't \"moderates\" and they must radically alter their religion. Max Rodenbeck, writing in \"The New York Review of Books\", notes that Ali's view of Islam has shifted and \"mellowed,\" as she no longer completely rejects Islam. She now narrowly criticizes what she calls \"Medina Muslims\", meaning the fundamentalists who envision a regime based on sharia, and who ignore the more inclusive passages of Muhammad's Meccan period, a small minority of Muslims, who are, nevertheless, quite influential among young Muslims, according to Hirsi Ali: \"These men, I find them to be far more influential in inspiring and mobilising young men to see the religion of Islam the way they see it, than the way either Imam Faisal says he sees it, or Maajid Nawaz says he sees it.\" Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that, in her opinion, \"The Christian extremists here, in the United States, who take the Bible and use it to kill people and hurt people, they are the fringe, but unfortunately, what we are seeing in Muslim countries is that the people who feel they should be governed under the Sharia Law, are not a fringe. (..) Islam can become a religion of peace, if politics is divorced from religion\", and she stated that: \"The individual that wants to kill me because I am an apostate of Islam, is inspired to do that from the scripture of Islam, the example of the prophet Mohammed, the clergy that preached to him, and the reward that he will get in the hereafter.\"\n\nShe described Islamic societies as lagging \"in enlightened thinking, tolerance and knowledge of other cultures\" and that their history cannot cite a single person who \"made a discovery in science or technology, or changed the world through artistic achievement\".\n\nIn a 2010 interview with The Guardian, she compared the responses of Christians and Muslims to criticism of their respective religions. While Christians would often simply ignore criticism, Muslims would instead take offence, display a victim mentality and take criticism as insults.\n\nShe insists that many contemporary Muslims have not yet transitioned to modernity, and that many Muslim immigrants are culturally unsuited to life in the West and are therefore a burden. Ali calls upon atheist and Christian Euro-Americans to unite against the Muslim extremism in the West. She urges the former to educate Muslims and the latter, especially Western Churches, to convert \"as many Muslims as possible to Christianity, introducing them to a God who rejects Holy War and who has sent his son to die for all sinners out of love for mankind\". Hirsi Ali stated that: \"Islam needs a reformation. Muslim leaders who are serious about achieving true and enduring peace, need to revise the Koran and the Hadith, so there is a consistency between what the peaceloving Muslims want and what their religion says.\"\n\nHirsi Ali speaking in April 2015, on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program said,\n\nIt's wrong for Western leaders like [former Prime Minister of Australia] Tony Abbott to say the actions of the Islamic State aren't about religion. I want to say to him 'please don't say such things in public because it's just not true.' You're letting down all the individuals who are reformers within Islam who are asking the right questions that will ultimately bring about change.\n\nSpeaking shortly after the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, Hirsi Ali commented on the nature of radicalization within communities of Islamic believers saying, \"If we talk about the process of what we now call radicalization, that you see a process where individuals are putting on a religious identity. It's all about being a Muslim, you shed the rest of it or you downplay the rest of it and you try to make everyone else as pious as yourself. And this would be, looking back at San Bernardino, the telltale signs. These changes that the family, the friends, the close circle of relatives should have observed.\"\n\nHirsi Ali criticises the central Islamic prophet on morality and personality traits (criticisms based on biographical details or depictions by Islamic texts and early followers of Muhammad). In January 2003 she told the Dutch paper \"Trouw\", \"Muhammad is, seen by our Western standards, a pervert and a tyrant\", as he married, at the age of 53, Aisha, who was six years old and nine at the time the marriage was consummated. She later said: \"Perhaps I should have said 'a pedophile'\". Muslims filed a religious discrimination suit against her that year. The civil court in The Hague acquitted Hirsi Ali of any charges, but said that she \"could have made a better choice of words\".\n\nHirsi Ali is a prominent opponent of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she has criticized in many of her writings. When in Dutch parliament, she proposed obligatory annual medical checks for all uncircumcised girls living in the Netherlands who came from countries where FGM is practised. She proposed that if a physician found that a Dutch girl had been mutilated, a report to the police would be required – with protection of the child prevailing over privacy. In 2004 she also criticized male circumcision, particularly as practiced by Jews and Muslims, which she regarded as being another variant of mutilation practiced without the consent of the individual.\n\nHirsi Ali has criticized Western feminists for avoiding the issue of the subjugation of women in the Muslim world and singled out Germaine Greer for arguing that FGM needs to be considered a \"cultural identity\" that western women don't understand.\n\nDuring the #Brandeis University controversy, Hirsi Ali noted that “an authority on ‘Queer/Feminist Narrative Theory’ siding with the openly homophobic Islamists”.\n\nRich Lowry writing for Politico wrote that while Hirsi Ali had many traits which should have made her a \"feminist hero\" such as: being a refugee from an abusive patriarchy, being an African immigrant who made her way to a Western country and an advocate for women's rights, this does not happen because she is \"a dissident of the wrong religion\". Feminists instead criticise Hirsi Ali for \"strengthening racism\" instead of \"weakening sexism\".\n\nIn a 2006 lecture in Berlin, she defended the right to offend, following the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark. She condemned the journalists of those papers and TV channels that did not show their readers the cartoons as being \"mediocre of mind.\" She also praised publishers all over Europe for showing the cartoons and not being afraid of what she called the \"hard-line Islamist movement.\"\n\nIn 2006 Hirsi Ali as MP supported the move by the Dutch courts to abrogate the party subsidy to a conservative Protestant Christian political party, the Political Reformed Party (SGP), which did not grant full membership rights to women and withholds passive voting rights from female members. She stated that \"any political party discriminating against women or homosexuals should be deprived of funding.\"\n\nIn the Netherlands about half of all education has historically been provided by sponsored religious schools, most of them Catholic or Protestant. As Muslims began to ask for support for schools, the state provided it and by 2005, there were 41 Islamic schools in the nation. This was based on the idea in the 1960s that Muslims could become one of the \"pillars\" of Dutch society, as were Protestants, Catholics and secular residents. Hirsi Ali has opposed state funding of any religious schools, including Islamic ones.\n\nThe Netherlands has always been one of the most prominent countries that support aiding developing countries. As the spokesperson of the VVD in the parliament on this matter, Hirsi Ali said that the current aid policy had not achieved an increase in prosperity, peace and stability in developing countries: \"The VVD believes that Dutch international aid has failed until now, as measured by [the Dutch aid effects on] poverty reduction, famine reduction, life expectancy and the promotion of peace.\"\n\nIn 2003 Hirsi Ali worked together with fellow VVD MP Geert Wilders for several months. They questioned the government about immigration policy. In reaction to the UN Development Programme Arab Human Development Report, Hirsi Ali asked questions of Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and the Minister without Portfolio for Development Cooperation Agnes van Ardenne. Together with parliamentarian Geert Wilders she asked the government to pay attention to the consequences for Dutch policy concerning the limitation of immigration from the Arab world to Europe, and in particular the Netherlands.\n\nAlthough she publicly supported the policy of VVD minister Rita Verdonk to limit immigration, privately she was not supportive, as she explained in a June 2006 interview for \"Opzij.\" This was given after she resigned from Parliament and shortly after she had moved to the United States.\n\nIn parliament, Hirsi Ali had supported the way Verdonk handled the Pasic case, although privately she felt that Pasic should have been allowed to stay. On the night before the debate, she phoned Verdonk to tell her that she had lied when she applied for asylum in the Netherlands, just as Pasic had. She said that Verdonk responded that if she had been minister at that time, she would have had Hirsi Ali deported.\n\nHirsi Ali discussed her view on immigration in Europe, in an OpEd article published in the \"Los Angeles Times\" in 2006. Noting that immigrants are over-represented \"in all the wrong statistics\", she wrote that the European Union's immigration policy contributed to the illegal trade in women and arms, and the exploitation of poor migrants by \"cruel employers.\"\n\nShe drew attention to the numerous illegal immigrants already in the Union. She believed that current immigration policy would lead to ethnic and religious division, nation states will lose their monopoly of force, Islamic law (sharia) will be introduced at the level of neighborhoods and cities, and exploitation of women and children will become \"commonplace\". To avoid this situation, she proposes three general principles for a new policy:\n\nRegarding unemployment, social marginalization and poverty among certain immigrant communities, Hirsi Ali places the burden of responsibility squarely on Islam and migrant culture.\n\nIn 2010, she opposed the idea of preventing immigrants from traditional Muslim societies from immigrating, claiming that allowing them to immigrate made the U.S. a \"highly moral country.\"\n\n\"When I speak of assimilation\", Ali clarifies, \"I mean assimilation into civilization. Aboriginals, Afghanis, Somalis, Arabs, Native Americans—all these non-Western groups have to make that transition to modernity\".\n\nHirsi Ali has expressed support for Israel.\n\nAs for Israel's problems, Hirsi Ali says, \"From my superficial impression, the country also has a problem with fundamentalists. The ultra-Orthodox will cause a demographic problem because these fanatics have more children than the secular and the regular Orthodox.\"\n\nOn Palestinians:\n\nOn the way Israel is perceived in the Netherlands:\n\nThe crisis of Dutch socialism can be sized up in its attitudes toward both Islam and Israel. It holds Israel to exceptionally high moral standards. The Israelis, however, will always do well, because they themselves set high standards for their actions. The standards for judging the Palestinians, however, are very low. Most outsiders remain silent on all the problems in their territories. That helps the Palestinians become even more corrupt than they already are. Those who live in the territories are not allowed to say anything about this because they risk being murdered by their own people.\n\nHirsi Ali married British historian Niall Ferguson on 10 September 2011. They have a son who was born in December 2011.\n\nHirsi Ali has attracted praise and criticism from English-speaking commentators. Literary critic and journalist Christopher Hitchens regarded her as \"the most important public intellectual probably ever to come out of Africa.\" Patt Morrison of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called Hirsi Ali a freedom fighter for feminism who has \"put her life on the line to defend women against radical Islam.\" American novelist and screenwriter Roger L. Simon has praised Ali's defense of women's rights, calling her \"one of the great positive figures of our time, a modern Joan of Arc who surpasses the original Joan in a moral sense and is at least her equal in pure guts.\"\n\nTunku Varadarajan wrote in 2017 that, with \"multiple fatwas on her head, Hirsi Ali has a greater chance of meeting a violent end than anyone I've met, Salman Rushdie included.\" According to Andrew Anthony of \"The Guardian\", Ayaan Hirsi Ali is admired by secularists and \"loathed not just by Islamic fundamentalists but by many western liberals, who find her rejection of Islam almost as objectionable as her embrace of western liberalism.\"\n\nIn his 2006 review of this collection of seventeen essays and articles on Islam by Hirsi Ali, journalist Christopher Hitchens noted her three themes: \"first, her own gradual emancipation from tribalism and superstition; second, her work as a parliamentarian to call attention to the crimes being committed every day by Islamist thugs in mainland Europe; and third, the dismal silence, or worse, from many feminists and multiculturalists about this state of affairs.\"\n\nHe described the activist as a \"charismatic figure in Dutch politics\" and criticised the Dutch government for how it protected her from Islamic threats after her collaboration with Theo van Gogh on the short film \"Submission\" and the assassination of the director.\n\nMahmood writes that the title of the work is \"highly reminiscent of the nineteenth-century literary genre centered on Orientalist fantasies of the harem\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" summarizes Infidel: \"[Hirsi Ali]'s is a story of exile from her clan through war, famine, arranged marriage, religious apostasy and the shocking murder on the streets of Amsterdam of her collaborator, Theo van Gogh. Told with lyricism, wit, huge sorrow and a great heart, this is one of the most amazing adventure narratives of the age of mass migration.\"\n\nWilliam Grimes wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"The circuitous, violence-filled path that led Ms. Hirsi Ali from Somalia to the Netherlands is the subject of \"Infidel,\" her brave, inspiring and beautifully written memoir. Narrated in clear, vigorous prose, it traces the author's geographical journey from Mogadishu to Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya, and her desperate flight to the Netherlands to escape an arranged marriage.\"\n\nIn his critique of the book, Christopher Hitchens noted that two leading leftist intellectual commentators, Timothy Garton Ash and Ian Buruma, described Hirsi Ali as an \"Enlightenment fundamentalist[s].\" Hitchens noted further that, far from being a \"fundamentalist,\" Hirsi escaped from a \"society where women are subordinate, censorship is pervasive, and violence is officially preached against unbelievers.\"\n\n\"The Guardian\" observes that Nomad \"(describes) a clan system shattering on the shores of modernity\". The books expands Hirsi Ali's previous early life descriptions focusing on \"the remarkable figure of her grandmother, who gave birth to daughters alone in the desert and cut her own umbilical cord, raged at herself for producing too many girls, rebelled against her husband, arranged for the circumcision of her granddaughters and instilled in them an unforgiving, woman-hating religion.\" \"Hirsi Ali observes that her own nomadic journey has been taken across borders that have been mental as much as geographical. In Nomad she calls her ancestral voices into direct confrontation with her demands for reform of Islamic theology. The result is electrifying.\"\n\nHirsi Ali calls \"Nomad\" her most provocative book for urging moderate Muslims to become Christians. She later backed off this view. After witnessing the Arab Spring, Hirsi Ali also took back her argument in \"Nomad\" that Islam is beyond reform.\n\nIn the book Hirsi Ali quotes statistics such that 75% of Pakistanis favour the death penalty for apostasy and argue that Sharia law is gaining ground in many Muslim-majority nations. Hirsi Ali quotes verses in the Qur'an encouraging followers to use violence and make the argument that as long as the Qur'an is pereceived to be the literal divine words, violent extremists have a justification for their acts.\n\nAndrew Anthony for the Guardian in 2015 wrote that even her fiercest critics would have problems denying what Hirsi Ali writes about current issues in Islam and since those issues are unpalatable an added difficulty was a cultural practice at the time to \"not offend anyone\". Anthony concluded that regardless of what critics may think of her solutoin, Hirsi Ali should be commended for her \"unblinking determination to address the problem\".\n\nSusan Dominus of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"In \"Heretic,\" Hirsi Ali forgoes autobiography for the most part in favor of an extended argument. But she has trouble making anyone else's religious history  – even that of Muhammad himself, whose life story she recounts  – as dramatic as she has made her own. And she loses the reader's trust with overblown rhetoric. ... She tries to warn Americans about their naïveté in the face of encroaching Islamic influences, maintaining that officials and journalists, out of cultural sensitivity, sometimes play down the honor killings that occur in the West.\"\n\n\"The Economist\" wrote: \"Unfortunately, very few Muslims will accept Ms Hirsi Ali's full-blown argument, which insists that Islam must change in at least five important ways. A moderate Muslim might be open to discussion of four of her suggestions if the question were framed sensitively. Muslims, she says, must stop prioritizing the afterlife over this life; they must \"shackle sharia\" and respect secular law; they must abandon the idea of telling others, including non-Muslims, how to behave, dress or drink; and they must abandon holy war. However, her biggest proposal is a show-stopper: she wants her old co-religionists to \"ensure that Muhammad and the Koran are open to interpretation and criticism\".\"\n\nClifford May of \"The Washington Times\" wrote: \"The West is enmeshed in 'an ideological conflict' that cannot be won 'until the concept of jihad has itself been decommissioned.'\" May goes on to suggest that if \"American and Western leaders continue to refuse to comprehend who is fighting us and why, the consequences will be dire.\"\n\nIn May 2015, Mehdi Hasan wrote an article in \"The Guardian\" arguing that Islam doesn't need a reformation and that she will never win any fans over from Muslims, regardless of whether they're liberal or conservative. Hasan wrote: \"She's been popping up in TV studios and on op-ed pages to urge Muslims, both liberal and conservative, to abandon some of their core religious beliefs while uniting behind a Muslim Luther. Whether or not mainstream Muslims will respond positively to a call for reform from a woman who has described the Islamic faith as a 'destructive, nihilistic cult of death' that should be 'crushed' and also suggesting that Benjamin Netanyahu be given the Nobel Peace Prize, is another matter.\" Hasan also invoked the death toll of the Christian sectarian conflicts of Thirty Years' War and the French Wars of Religion to argue that an Islamic reformation would lead to conflicts of a similar scale. Hasan also wrote that Islamic reformation should not be promoted by non-Muslims or ex-Muslims.\n\nSaba Mahmood writes that Hirsi Ali \"had no public profile until she decided to capitalize on the anti-Muslim sentiment that swept Europe following the events of 9/11\".\n\nAdam Yaghi has questioned her appeal in American society where her \"serial autobiographies are treated as honest and reliable testimonies in spite of the troubling inaccuracies, exaggerated descriptions, blunt neo-Orientalist portrayals, and sweeping generalizations\". Stephen Sheehi writes that in spite of her lack of scholarly credentials and academic qualifications \"to speak authoritatively about Islam and the Arab world\", Hirsi Ali has been accepted in the West as a scholar, feminist activist, and reformer primarily on the grounds of her \"insider claims about Islam\".\n\nCritics have labelled Ali as an \"inauthentic ethnic voice\", at the service of imperialist feminism. According to Kiran Grewal, Ali is \"a classic enactment of the colonial 'civilizing mission' discourse\". Grewal describes Hirsi Ali's works as using \"the language of 'lived experience' to justify an intolerant and exclusionary message\". She notes that Hirsi Ali has generally been ignored or derided by feminists due to her \"extremely provocative and often offensive statements regarding Islam and Muslim immigrants in the West\". Grewal concludes that \"it is not surprising many academics committed to an anti-racist agenda have baulked at engaging with Hirsi Ali\".\n\nYaghi comments that \"Ali attributes everything bad to a monolithic Islam, one that transcends geographic and national boundaries ... willfully ignoring her own distinctions between different interpretations of Islam, versions she personally encountered before leaving to the West\". Pearl Abraham makes a similar observation: \"[I]n her writings, lectures, and interviews\", Ali \"reaches for the simple solution and quick answer. Always and everywhere, she insists on depicting Islam and Muslims as the enemy, her tribal culture as backward\". Hirsi Ali is also criticized for persistently singling out Islam and Muslims, but never manifestations of religious revivalism present with other religions.\n\nDespite positioning herself on a mission to fight for her fellow Muslim women, Yaghi states \"yet, in her works, she belittles Muslim women and paints them as either perpetrators of oppression or naïve submissive clowns, voiceless and hopeless. These women, Ali insists, will be saved only when they divorce themselves from their native religion and culture and embrace a Western consciousness as she did\".\n\nAccording to Rula Jebreal, a Palestinian journalist and foreign policy analyst, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's criticism applies mostly to \"Wahhabism\", the strain of Islam most familiar to Hirsi Ali, and not to Islam as a whole. Jebreal added that Ali's \"outbursts\" are originated from her own pains, \"physical scars inflicted on her body during childhood,\" which were justified by a radical version of the religion into which she was born. Jebreal wrote: \" To endorse Hirsi Ali so unabashedly is to insult and mock a billion Muslims\". \"It's time to listen to what is being said by the Muslim voices of peace and tolerance. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is not one of them,\" she added. Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, condemned her \"one of the worst of the worst of the Islam haters in America, not only in America but worldwide.\"\n\nHirsi Ali has continued discussion of these issues in her two autobiographies, published in Dutch in 2006 and in English in 2010. In her first work, she said that in 1992 her father arranged to marry her to a distant cousin. She says that she objected to this both on general grounds (she has said she dreaded being forced to submit to a stranger, sexually and socially), and specifically to this man, whom she described as a \"bigot\" and an \"idiot\" in her book.\n\nShe told her family that she planned to join her husband, who was living in Canada, after obtaining a visa while in Germany. But in her autobiography, she said she spent her time in Germany trying to devise an escape from her unwanted marriage. She decided to visit a relative in the Netherlands, and to seek help after arrival and claim asylum.\n\nHer first autobiography, \"\" (2006), was published in English in 2007.

Palijo is the president of Qomi Awami Tahreek (Peoples Movement) and central convener and founder of the Sindh Progressive Anti-Nationalist Alliance (SPANA). Since 2007, he has represented the left, objecting to the division of the southeastern Pakistan province of Sindh. He has often been criticized for his two-faced approach, portraying himself as a Nationalist while supporting MQM under the umbrella of Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) in order to promote his hugely unsuccessful political career. His accomplishments include losing Provincial assembly seat to Jam Khan Shoro of PPP in 2013 General Elections.\n\nPalijo's mother was the Baloch women's rights activist, writer and artist, Jeejee Zarina Baloch. His father was Rasool Bux Palijo, the Sindhi leftist founder of Awami Tahreek.\n\nPalijo was educated at the Model School, Old-campus, Sindh University, Hyderabad. In his teenage years, under his mother's guidance, Palijo studied Sindhi, Balochi and Urdu. He later became conversant in English, Seraiki, Punjabi and Persian.\n\nAt age eleven, Palijo was central secretary general of the Gulan Jahra Barira and the Sujag Bar Tahreek, the children's wing of the Awami Tahreek. He was then a university student activist.\n\nPalijo received a degree in civil engineering from Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, and a degree in law from Sindh University, Jamshoro. He received a degree in environment and development from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Palijo also received a postgraduate degree in rural development from Sindh University and Wye College, United Kingdom.\n\nPalijo received a LEAD (leadership in educational administrate doctorate) in the seventh cohort.\n\nPalijo is a constitutional lawyer of Sindh High Court, formerly qualified the PCS served for civil services for some time. He led the movement that culminated in the restoration of the Chief Justice, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry.\n\nPalijo is the president of Awami Tahreek of Pakistan (Peoples Movement of pakistan) and central convener and founder of the Sindh Progressive Anti-Nationalist Alliance (SPANA). He said, \n\nPalijo is strongly against the construction of Kalabagh Dam.\n\nIn May 2012, Awami Tehrik Party members and workers organised a rally in Karachi to support the formation of the Mohajir province (Lyari Mohajir Suba).\n\nIn 2012, women were able to attend Muhabat-e-Sindh (Love of Sindh) rally in equal numbers to men. The marchers were attacked near Nawa Lane, Pan Mandi and Juna Market. Eleven people were killed and about thirty were injured. Palijo announced to the press a peaceful strike in Sindh to highlight the incident and said his party would stage a sit-in protest till the attackers were apprehended.\n\nOn Saturday, 14 July 2012, two months after the anti-Mohajir rally, Palijo announced that a Shaheedan-e-Muhabbat-e-Sindh Jalsa would take place on Sunday, 15 July at Gabol Park, Lyari. In his speech, Palijo said, \"Nobody can stop us from entering Lyari and other parts of Karachi.\" Palijo criticised the Sindh Government, saying that 4000 policemen were deployed by the Sindh government to stop his rally. After the announcement, the Sindh home minister ordered Palijo's arrest and Palijo received threats of attacks.\n\nOn 11 May 2013, a general election took place. Palijo was a candidate for PS-47 Qasimabad, Hyderabad constituency. Palijo lost the contest with 14,901 votes. Palijo challenged the result in the Sindh High Court and asked for a re-election. He claimed his agents at the polling booths had been harassed.\n\nOn 4 January 2014, Altaf Hussain the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (M.Q.M.) called for a separate province. The PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto disagreed. Palijo also disagreed and threatened strikes and protests. Two days later the M.Q.M sent a delegation under Wasim Akhtar to discuss the matter with Palijo. Palijo called off the strikes and protests.\n\n"}

{"id": "8112790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8112790", "title": "Bulgarian verbs", "text": "Bulgarian verbs\n\nBulgarian verbs are the most complicated part of Bulgarian grammar, especially when compared with other Slavic languages. They are inflected for person, number and sometimes gender. They also have lexical aspect (perfective and imperfective), voice, nine tenses, three moods, four evidentials and six non-finite verbal forms. Because the subject of the verb can be inferred from the verb ending, it is often omitted. As there is no infinitive in the contemporary Bulgarian language the basic form of a verb is its present simple tense first person singular form.\n\nThere are three conjugations. The conjugation of a verb determined by the final vowel of the verb in the third person singular present simple tense. Verbs of the first conjugation end in e, of the second in и and of the third in а or я.\n\nBulgarian verbs express lexical aspect (\"вид\"). The verbs are either of imperfective (\"глаголи от несвършен вид\") or perfective (\"глаголи от свършен вид\") aspect. The former describe actions in progress (uncompleted actions) and the latter whole completed actions (actions which have a beginning and an end). So in Bulgarian an English verb is usually translated by two verbs (or sometimes by even three, see below). Perfective verbs can be usually formed from imperfective ones by suffixation or prefixation, but when prefixes (or very rarely suffixes) are used the resultant verb often deviates in meaning from the original. There are not any strict rules and irregularities are very common. Nevertheless many verbs can be grouped according to their stem change:\n\nThe verbs from one pair are of different conjugations, for example \"кажа\" is from the first conjugation and \"казвам\" from the third.\n\nIn the past imperfect and the present tense perfective verbs cannot stand alone in an independent clause, in these tenses such verbs are used only in subordinate clauses.\n\nVery often when a perfective verb is formed from an imperfective one by means of a prefix (or rarely a suffix) this verb can be made again imperfective using a suffix. The resultant verb is called secondary imperfective verb (\"вторичен несвършен глагол\"). Here are some examples of such verbs:\n\nVerbs from the first type describe uncompleted actions (for example the verb \"мета\" could be roughly translated in English as \"to be sweeping\"), verbs from the second describe whole, completed actions. Verbs from the third type are a combination between the first two. Although they are imperfective as the initial ones, they preserve the perfective meaning of the second verbs, they are only grammatically imperfective.\n\nAn explanation of the nuances between the three columns follows:\n\nSecondary imperfective verbs are used in cases where it's grammatically incorrect to use perfective verbs (there are tenses, the present tense for example, where perfective verbs cannot stand alone in an independent clause) but one wants to use their meaning, or where the action is complete but repeated over time. See below for examples.\n\n\nThe present tense is used to:\n\nImperfective and perfective verbs are conjugated in the same way.\n\nVerbs form the present tense according to their conjugation. They take the following personal endings:\nSee Bulgarian verb paradigm for the full conjugation.\n\nAlthough verbs of the first and second conjugation in first person singular end in -а/я, and in third person plural in -ат/ят, when the stress falls on these endings, they are not pronounced а/йа and ат/йат but ъ/йъ and ът/йът instead.\n\nThe incorrect pronunciation is considered to be an error.\n\nNewly adopted verbs, especially from English, tend to take a –ирам (\"–iram\") ending, in which case they only have one form (the imperfective). Since this is not a native suffix (loaned from German verbal suffix \"-ieren\"), recent colloquial formations prefer the native suffixes \"–вам\" (\"-vam\") and \"–на\" (\"–na\") which do form an imperfective/perfective pair. Examples:\nThese verbs, especially the latter group, are extremely new and have not yet made it into the dictionaries.\n\nPast Imperfect (Минало несвършено време) is used to talk about a temporary situation that existed at or around a particular time in the past. It also expresses past actions that were frequent, repeated, permanent or always true. Its most common use is in story telling to provide a background to other actions which are usually expressed with verbs in the past aorist. In this use it means that the action had begun and was in progress when the other action(s) happened, we do not know whether it stopped or not.\n\nBoth imperfective and perfective verbs have past imperfect. They are conjugated in the same way.\n\nVerbs form the past imperfect with the following endings (they are the same for all conjugations):\n\nThese endings are added to the past imperfect basis. See Bulgarian verb paradigm for the full conjugation.\n\nPast aorist (Минало свършено време) expresses an action that happened at a specific time in the past. Both imperfective and perfective verbs have such tense (there is no difference in their conjugation).\n\nSimilarly, as in past imperfect, verbs have past aorist basis to which the following personal endings are added (they are the same for all conjugations):\n\nSee Bulgarian verb paradigm for the full conjugation.\n\nAlthough imperfective and perfective verbs are conjugated in the same way in the past aorist, there is difference in their meaning. Compare the sentences:\n\nUsually the difference between the two tenses is very clear:\nBut imperfective verbs both in past imperfect and past aorist can express actions that have long duration and therefore both tenses can be used to say that one action happened at the same time as another. One should always keep in mind that past aorist means that the action began and stopped, and past imperfect that the action was in progress. Compare the sentences (they all contain the imperfective verb играя that expresses an action with some duration, but depending on the tense the sentences have different meaning):\n\nPresent perfect (in Bulgarian минало неопределено време, past indefinite tense) expresses an action which happened in the past, but the precise moment when it happened is not specified. It is either not known or not important (in contrast with past aorist). What is important is the result of the action. The tense has a lot in common with the English present perfect.\n\nPresent perfect is made up of the verb съм, conjugated in present tense, and the past active aorist participle of the main verb. Not only person (first, second, third) and number, but also gender must be taken into account in the process of conjugating. In other words, the corresponding indefinite forms of the participle (masculine, feminine, neuter, singular, plural) are used according to the gender and number of the subject. For the position of the verb съм see word order.\n\nExample (\"чета\", to read):\n\nIn contrast with English, in Bulgarian (very rarely) the present perfect can be used even if the moment when the action happened is specified. In such cases the importance of the action or its result is emphasized:\n\nPast perfect (in Bulgarian минало предварително време, \"past preliminary tense\") expresses an action that happened before another past action. It is made up of the past tense of съм and the past active aorist participle of the main verb. Again as in present perfect the participle agrees in number and gender with the subject. For the position of the verb съм see word order.\n\nExample (\"чета\", to read):\nRarely the past perfect can be used for actions that happened at an indefinite time in the past but very long ago, especially in sentences containing the phrase \"someone sometimes said\":\n\nThe future tense (in Bulgarian бъдеще време) is formed with the particle ще (derived from the verb ща, \"to want\") and the present simple tense (ще always stands before the present forms). In contrast with the other tenses negation is not expressed with the particle не, but with the construction няма да + the present tense. Forms with не are also possible but they are found mainly in the poetry.\n\nExample (\"чета\", to read):\n\nThe verb съм forms the future in two ways. The first one with its present tense, and the second one with its special future form - бъда. The latter is more common:\n\nFuture perfect (in Bulgarian бъдеще предварително време, future preliminary tense) expresses an action which is to take place in the future before another future action. It is made up of the future tense of the verb съм (in this tense the form with бъда is less common than the usual one) and the past active aorist participle of the main verb which agrees in number and gender with the subject.\n\nExample (\"чета\", to read):\nPast future tense or future in the past (in Bulgarian бъдеще време в миналото, future tense in the past) expresses an action which was to be completed in the past but was future as regards another past action. It is made up of the past imperfect of the verb ща \"will, want\", the particle да \"to\" and the present tense of the main verb. Negation is expressed with the construction нямаше да + the present tense, although forms with не are also possible but found mainly in the poetry.\n\nExample (\"чета\", to read):\nThe verb съм forms the future in the past in two ways. The first one with its present tense, and the second one with бъда (\"щях да съм\" and \"щях да бъда\"). The latter is more common.\n\nPast future perfect or future perfect in the past (in Bulgarian бъдеще предварително време в миналото, future preliminary tense in the past) expresses a past action which is future with respect to a past action which itself is prior to another past action. It is made up of the past imperfect of ща \"will, want\", the particle да \"to\", the present tense of the verb съм \"be\" (in other words, the past future tense of съм, but not the form with бъда) and the past active aorist participle of the main verb, which agrees in number and gender with the subject.\n\nExample (\"чета\", to read):\nThe voice in Bulgarian adjectives is presented not through the auxiliary verb, as it is in English (\"I \"have\" eaten\" - active; \"I \"was\" eaten\" - passive), but rather by the ending on the past participle; the auxiliary remains \"съм\" (\"to be\"):\n\nModal distinctions in subordinate clauses are expressed not through verb endings, but through the choice of complementizer - \"че (che)\" or \"да (da)\" (which might both be translated with the relative pronoun \"that\"). The verbs remain unchanged. Thus:\n\nThe imperative has its own conjugation - usually by adding \"-и\" or \"-ай\" (\"-i\" or \"-ay\") to the root of the verb:\n\nThe so-called conditional refers to a possible action, which is usually intentional and under the control of a subject. It is formed by a special form of the auxiliary 'съм' (to be), and the aorist active participle of the main verb:\n\nBulgarian verbs are inflected not only for aspect, tense and modality, but also for evidentiality, that is, the source of the information conveyed by them. There is a four-way distinction between the unmarked (indicative) forms, which imply that the speaker was a witness of the event or knows it as a general fact; the inferential, which signals general non-witness information or one based on inference; the renarrative, which indicates that the information was reported to the speaker by someone else; and the dubitative, which is used for reported information if the speaker doubts its veracity. This can be illustrated with the four possible ways of rendering in Bulgarian the English sentence 'The dog ate the fish' (here denotes the aorist active participle):\n\nIndicative:\n\nInferential:\n\nRenarrative:\n\nDubitative:\n\nOn a theoretical level, there are alternatives to treating those forms as the four members of a single evidential category. I. Kutsarov, for example, posits a separate category, which he terms 'type of utterance' (\"вид на изказването\"), proper to which is only the distinction between forms, expressing speaker's own statements (indicative, inferential), and forms that retell statements of another (renarrative, dubitative). The inferential is then viewed as one of the moods, and the dubitative - as a renarrative inferential, whose dubitative meaning, albeit more frequent, is only secondary. Another view is presented by G. Gerdzhikov - in his treatment there are two distinctive features involved - subjectivity and renarrativity. The indicative is unmarked for both, the inferential is marked for subjectivity, the renarrative - for renarrativity, and the dubitative is marked for both subjectivity and renarrativity.\n\nAn evidential for a given tense is formed by taking the past active participle of the verb (or auxiliary, if there is one) of the corresponding indicative tense, and adding a form of the auxiliary verb \"съм\" (to be). For the inferential and the renarrative it is its present tense form, which, however, is omitted in the 3rd person of the renarrative; hence inferential and renarrative forms are generally not distinguished in the 1st and 2nd person. The dubitative is formed from the renarrative by adding the past active participle of the verb \"съм\" (to be). An example paradigm is given in the following table. Given for reference are some tenses of the indicative (these are the imperfect, aorist, perfect, future in the past and future perfect in the past). Whenever there are participles involved, they are given in their masculine form, but they have different forms for the three genders in the singular.\n\nAdditionally, there are also a few rare forms for some of the future tenses. In some cases, there are less common forms in which the auxiliary \"ще\" remains impersonal instead of being inflected for person and number; thus for the inferential and renarrative future/future in the past rare forms of the type \"ще съм четя̀л\" are possible alongside the more common forms of the type \"щя̀л съм да чета̀\", for the inferential future perfect in the past - \"ще съм бѝл чѐл\" alongside the usual \"щя̀л съм да съм чѐл\", and for the dubitative future/ future in the past - rare forms of the type \"ще съм бѝл четя̀л\" in addition to the more common forms of the type \"щя̀л съм бѝл да чета̀\". Also, the negative form of the dubitative future perfect/future perfect in the past can be either \"ня̀мало било̀ да съм чѐл\", or \"ня̀мало съм бил да съм чѐл\".\n\nPast active aorist participle (минало свършено деятелно причастие) is used to form the present perfect, in the renarrative and conditional mood and as an adjective. It is formed by adding -л (this is its masculine indefinite form) to the past aorist basis (first person singular past aorist tensе but without the final х), but additional alterations of the basis are also possible. The indefinite feminine, neuter and plural forms take respectively the endings -а, -о and -и after the masculine form. The definite forms are formed from the indefinite by adding the definite articles -ят/я for masculine participles, та for feminine participles, то for neuter participles and те for plural participles\nSee Bulgarian verb paradigm for the full conjugation.\n\n"}

Its speakers largely use the Latin alphabet, as is illustrated in their locally published newspaper.\n\nIn the 2002 census results published by the Statistical Office of Serbia, Bunjevac was not listed among main languages spoken in Serbia, but those that declared that their language is Bunjevac were listed in category \"other languages\".

According to the 2002 census in Serbia, some members of the Bunjevac ethnic community declared that their native language to be Serbian or Croatian. This does not mean that they do not use this specific dialect, but merely that they do not consider it sufficiently distinct from the aforementioned standard languages to register as speakers of a separate language. However, those Bunjevci who declared Bunjevac to be their native language consider it a separate language.\n\nIn the old Austro-Hungarian censuses (for example one from 1910), Bunjevac was declared as a native language of numerous citizens (for example in the city of Subotica 33,247 people declared Bunjevac as their native language in 1910).

{"id": "161692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161692", "title": "Burushaski", "text": "Burushaski\n\nBurushaski (; ) is a language isolate spoken by Burusho people who reside almost entirely in northern Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, with a few hundred speakers in northern Jammu and Kashmir, India. In Pakistan, Burushaski is spoken by people in Hunza-Nagar District, northern Gilgit District, and in the Yasin and Ishkoman valleys of northern Ghizer District. Their native region is located in northern Gilgit–Baltistan and borders with Pamir corridor to the north. In India, Burushaski is spoken in Botraj Mohalla of the Hari Parbat region in Srinagar. Other names for the language are \"Biltum\", \"Khajuna\", \"Kunjut\", \"Brushaski\", \"Burucaki\", \"Burucaski\", \"Burushaki\", \"Burushki\", \"Brugaski\", \"Brushas\", \"Werchikwar\" and \"Miśa:ski\".\n\nAttempts have been made to establish links between Burushaski and several different language families, although none has been accepted by a majority of linguists.\n\nFollowing Berger (1956), the \"American Heritage\" dictionaries suggested that the word \"*abel\" ‘apple’, the only name for a fruit (tree) reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European, may have been borrowed from a language ancestral to Burushaski. (\"Apple\" and \"apple tree\" are \"báalt\" in modern Burushaski.)\n\nOther hypotheses posit a genealogical relationship between Burushaski and the North Caucasian languages, Kartvelian languages, Yeniseian languages and/or Indo-European languages, usually in proposed macrofamilies.\n\nThe linguist Sadaf Munshi stated that Burushaski may have developed alongside the Dravidian languages before the Indo-Aryan migration to South Asia, mentioning the fact that both possess retroflex sounds.\n\nBurushaski is spoken by about 90,000 speakers in Pakistan, and also by a few hundred in India. In Pakistan, it is spoken in main valleys: Hunza, Nagar, and Yasin. The varieties of Hunza and Nagar diverge slightly, but are clearly dialects of a single language. The Yasin variety, also known by the Khowar exonym \"Werchikwar\", is much more divergent. Intelligibility between Hunza-Nagar and Yasin is difficult, and Yasin is sometimes considered a distinct language. Yasin is the least affected by contact with neighboring languages, though speakers are bilingual in Khowar. Yasin is spoken by a quarter of Burushaski speakers.\n\nIn India, Jammu & Kashmir Burushaski (JKB) \"has developed divergent linguistic features which make it systematically different from the varieties spoken in Pakistan.\" The dialect of Burushashki spoken in India has been influenced by Kashmiri, as well as Hindi and Urdu. Unique to JKB is the features of vowel syncopation. Jammu & Kashmir Burushaski shares more similarities with the dialect spoken in Nagar than with that spoken in Hunza.\n\nBurushaski is a predominantly spoken rather than written language. Occasionally the Urdu alphabet is used, but no fixed orthography exists. Adu Wazir Shafi wrote a book \"Burushaski Razon\" using a Latin script.\n\nTibetan sources record a \"Bru-śa\" language of the Gilgit valley, which appears to have been Burushaski, whose script was one of five scripts used to write the extinct Zhang-Zhung language. Although Burushaski may once have been a significant literary language, no \"Bru-śa\" manuscripts are known to have survived.\n\nLinguists working on Burushaski use various makeshift transcriptions based on the Latin alphabet, most commonly that by Berger (see below), in their publications.\n\nBurushaski primarily has five vowels, /i e a o u/. Various contractions result in long vowels; stressed vowels (marked with acute accents in Berger's transcription) tend to be longer and less \"open\" than unstressed ones ( as opposed to ). Long vowels also occur in loans and in a few onomatopoeic words (Grune 1998). All vowels have nasal counterparts in Hunza (in some expressive words) and in Nager (also in proper names and a few other words).\n\nBerger (1998) finds the following consonants to be phonemic, shown below in his transcription and in the :\nNotes:\nBurushaski is a double-marking language and word order is generally subject–object–verb.\n\nNouns in Burushaski are divided into four genders: human masculine, human feminine, countable objects, and uncountable ones (similar to mass nouns). The assignment of a noun to a particular gender is largely predictable. Some words can belong both to the countable and to the uncountable class, producing differences in meaning. For example, when countable, \"báalt\" means 'apple' but when uncountable, it means 'apple tree' (Grune 1998).\n\nNoun morphology consists of the noun stem, a possessive prefix (mandatory for some nouns, and thus an example of inherent possession), and number and case suffixes. Distinctions in number are singular, plural, indefinite, and grouped. Cases include absolutive, ergative/oblique, genitive, and several locatives; the latter indicate both location and direction and may be compounded.\n\nBurushaski verbs have three basic stems: past tense, present tense, and consecutive. The past stem is the citation form and is also used for imperatives and nominalization; the consecutive stem is similar to a past participle and is used for coordination. Agreement on the verb has both nominative and ergative features: transitive verbs and unaccusatives mark both the subject and the object of a clause, while unergatives verbs mark only subject agreement on the verb. Altogether, a verb can take up to four prefixes and six suffixes.\n\nIn Burushaski, there are four noun classes, similar to declensional classes in Indo-European languages, but unlike Indo-European, the nominal classes in Burushaski are associated with four grammatical \"genders\":\n\nBelow, the abbreviation \"h\" will stand for the combination of the m- and f-classes, while \"hx\" will stand for the combination of the m-, f- and x-classes. Nouns in the x-class typically refer to countable, non-human beings or things, for example animals, fruit, stones, eggs, or coins; conversely, nouns in the y-class are as a rule uncountable abstractions or mass nouns, such as rice, fire, water, snow, wool, etc.\n\nHowever, these rules are not universal – countable objects in the y-class are sometimes encountered, e.g. \"ha\", 'house'. Related words can subtly change their meanings when used in different classes – for example, \"bayú\", when a member of the x-class, means salt in clumps, but when in the y-class, it means powdered salt. Fruit trees are understood collectively and placed in the y-class, but their individual fruits belong to the x-class. Objects made of particular materials can belong to either the x- or the y- class: stone and wood are in the x-class, but metal and leather in the y-class. The article, adjectives, numerals and other attributes must be in agreement with the noun class of their subject.\n\nThere are two numbers in Burushaski: singular and plural. The singular is unmarked, while the plural is expressed by means of suffix, which vary depending on the class of the noun:\n\nSome nouns admit two or three different prefixes, while others have no distinctive suffix, and occur only in the plural, e.g. \"bras\" 'rice', \"gur\" 'wheat', \"bishké\", 'fur', (cf. plurale tantum). On the other hand, there are also nouns which have identical forms in the singular and plural, e.g. \"hagúr\" 'horse(s)'. Adjectives have a unique plural suffix, whose form depends on the class of the noun they modify, e.g. \"burúm\" 'white' gives the x-class plural \"burum-išo\" and the y-class plural \"burúm-ing\".\n\nExamples of pluralisation in Burushaski:\n\nBurushaski is an ergative language. It has five primary cases.\n\nThe case suffixes are appended to the plural suffix, e.g. \"Huséiniukutse\", 'the people of Hussein' (ergative plural). The genitive ending is irregular, /mo/, for singular f-class nouns, but /-e/ in all others (identical to the ergative ending). The dative ending, /-ar/, /-r/ is attached to the genitive ending for singular f-class nouns, but to the stem for all others. Examples:\n\nThe genitive is placed before the thing possessed: \"Hunzue tham\", 'the Emir of Hunza.'\n\nThe endings of the secondary cases are formed from a secondary case suffix (or infix) and one of the primary endings /-e/, /-ar/ or /-um/. These endings are directional, /-e/ being locative (answering 'where?'), /-ar/ being terminative (answering 'where to?'), and /-um/ being ablative (answering 'where from?'). The infixes, and their basic meanings, are as follows:\n\n\nFrom these, the following secondary or compound cases are formed:\n\nThe regular endings /-ul-e/ and /-ul-ar/ are archaic and are now replaced by /-ul-o/ and /-ar-ulo/ respectively.\n\nNouns indicating parts of the body and kinship terms are accompanied by an obligatory pronominal prefix. Thus, one cannot simply say 'mother' or 'arm' in Burushaski, but only 'my arm', 'your mother', 'his father', etc. For example, the root \"mi\" 'mother', is never found in isolation, instead one finds:\n\nThe pronominal, or personal, prefixes agree with the person, number and – in the third person, the class of their noun. A summary of the basic forms is given in the following table:\n\nPersonal pronouns in Burushaski distinguish proximal and distal forms, e.g. \"khin\" 'he, this one here', but \"in\", 'he, that one there'. In the oblique, there are additional abbreviated forms.\n\nThe Burushaski number system is vigesimal, i.e. based on the number 20. For example, 20 \"altar\", 40 \"alto-altar\" (2 times 20), 60 \"iski-altar\" (3 times 20) etc. The base numerals are:\n\nExamples of compound numerals:\n\n11 \"turma-han\", 12 \"turma-alto\", 13 \"turma-isko\", ... , 19 \"turma-hunti\";\n20 \"altar\", 30 \"altar-toorumo\", 40 \"alto-altar\", 50 \"alto-altar-toorumo\", 60 \"iski-altar\" and so on;\n21 \"altar-hak\", 22 \"altar-alto\", 23 \"altar-isko\" and so on.\n\nThe verbal morphology of Burushaski is extremely complicated and rich in forms. Many sound changes can take place, including assimilation, deletion and accent shift, which are unique for almost every verb. Here, we can only specify certain basic principles.\n\nThe Burushaski finite verb falls into the following categories:\n\nFor many transitive verbs, in addition to the subject, the (direct) object is also indicated, also by pronomimal prefixes which vary according to person, number and class. All verbs have negative forms, and many intransitive verbs also have derived transitive forms. The infinitive forms – which in Burushaski are the absolutives of the past and present, the perfect participle, and two infinitives – admit all the finite variations except tense and mood. Infinitive forms are made together with auxiliary verbs and periphrastic forms.\n\nAll verb forms can be constructed according to a complex but regular position system. Berger describes a total of 11 possible positions, or slots, although not all of these will be filled in any given verb form. Many positions also have several alternative contents (indicated by A/B/C below). The verb stem is in position 5, preceded by four possible prefixes and followed by seven possible suffixes. The following table gives an overview of the positions and their functions\n\nThe formation of the tenses and moods involves the use of several positions, or slots, in complicated ways. The preterite, perfect, pluperfect and conative are formed from the 'simple stem,' whereas the present, imperfect, future and conditional are formed from the 'present stem,' which is itself formed from the simple stem by placing -č- in position 7. The optative and imperative are derived directly from the stem. Altogether, the schema is as follows:\n\nThe formation of the tenses and moods of the verb \"her\" 'to cry', without prefixes:\n\nThe subject and object of the verb are indicated by the use of personal prefixes and suffixes in positions 3, 8 and 10 as follows:\n\nThe personal prefixes are identical to the pronominal prefixes of nouns (mandatory with body parts and kinship terms, as above). A simplified overview of the forms of the affixes is given in the following table:\n\nFor example, the construction of the preterite of the transitive verb \"phus\" 'to tie', with prefixes and suffixes separated by hyphens, is as follows :\n\nThe personal affixes are also used when the noun occupies the role of the subject or the object, e.g. \"hir i-ír-i-mi\" 'the man died'. With intransitive verbs, the subject function is indicated by both a prefix and a suffix, as in:\n\nPersonal prefixes do not occur in all verbs and all tenses. Some verbs do not admit personal prefixes, others still do so only under certain circumstances. Personal prefixes used with intransitive verbs often express a volitional function, with prefixed forms indicating an action contrary to the intention of the subject. For example:\n\nA number of verbs – mostly according to their root form – are found with the d-prefix in position 2, which occurs before a consonant according to vowel harmony. The precise semantic function of the d-prefix is unclear. With primary transitive verbs the d-prefix, always without personal prefixes, forms regular intransitives. Examples:\n\nA master's thesis research work of a native speaker of Burushaski on Middle Voice Construction in he Hunza Dialect claims that the [dd-] verbal prefix is an overt morphological middle marker for MV constructions, while the [n-] verbal prefix is a morphological marker for passive voice. The data primarily come from the Hunza dialect of Burushaski, but analogous phenomena can be observed in other dialects. This research is based on a corpus of 120 dd-prefix verbs. This research has showed that position {-2} on the verb template is occupied by voice-marker in Burushaski. The author argues that the middle marker is a semantic category of its own and that it is clearly distinguished from the reflexive marker in this language. The middle marker (MM) means the grammatical device used to \"indicate that the two semantic roles of Initiator and Endpoint refer to a single holistic entity\" (Kemmer 1993: 47). In the view of that definition, I look at a middle marked verb in Burushaski and illustration follows the example. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53686192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53686192", "title": "Caspar Decurtins", "text": "Caspar Decurtins\n\nCaspar Decurtins (23 November 1855 - 30 May 1916) was a politician (Catholic-Conservative) from the Surselva region, up-river to the west of Chur in the Swiss canton of Grisons.\n\nHe is regarded as a leading pioneer of the European movement.\n\nCaspar Decurtins was born in Trun, a small village in the Romansh speaking western part of the canton. His father, Laurenz Christian Decurtins, was a physician and one of the local land owners. His mother, born Margaretha Katharina Latour, also came from a prominent family in the Vorderrhein (literally: \"pre-Rhine\") valley. The politician (1827-1861) was a paternal uncle.\n\nHe attended Gymnasium (secondary school) in Disentis and Chur, before moving to Germany in 1875 to conclude his university-level studies. He studied History, Art history and Civil Law at Munich and Heidelberg where after just three (half-year) terms he received his doctorate in 1876. His doctoral work concerned the seventeenth century Grisons Landammann (\"chief magistrate\") . He then spent a term at Strasbourg. In political terms, he had grown up in the liberal enlightenment ambience of his mother's family, the Latours. He showed early evidence of his own political commitment in 1874, however, when he was expelled from the while still in Chur, after he showed his support for Ultramontanism. In 1875, he joined an alternative student association, the Schweizerischer Studentenverein. \n\nDecurtin returned to Grisons in 1877 and immediately involved himself in politics. On 6 May 1877, despite his youth, he was proposed for election by around 1,300 eligible voters and elected to the , representing the Cadi electoral district and remaining a member till 1904. In the cantonal assembly he took a leadership role within the Catholic-Conservative faction, today seen as the principal forerunner of the Christian Democratic People's Party. Following the 1881 national election he was elected a member of the lower house of the Swiss Federal (i.e. national) parliament. \n\nA principal focus of his contributions was in the area of social reform. In the national parliament (as in the cantonal one) his was a forceful presence, but he was resolutely non-tribal in his political approach, happy to oppose laissez-faire economic doctrines then in fashion with fellow conservatives, and to work with liberals and socialists in pursuit of social catholic objectives. \"Hunger is neither catholic nor protestant\", as he pointed out. He joined up with Georges Favon, the radical member from Geneva, to draft and argue for a motion supporting an international law for the protection of workers. His willingness to work with \"the left\" was believed to be out of keeping with his catholic ultramontane convictions, and attracted lively criticism from within his own party.\n\nThere were socially progressive measures that he backed, designed to protect the most socially disadvantaged members of society. He supported half-day working on Saturdays and the establishment of Sunday as a day of rest. On the other hand, he staunchly opposed other \"left-wing\" goals including railway nationalisation, creation of a Swiss national bank or public subsidy for schools, always fearful of state intervention in school affairs.\n\nLocally, after 1877 he teamed up with to campaign for the preservation of Disentis Abbey, which had been threatened with closure, as was the fate of many religious houses in Switzerland at this time. A cantonal referendum to preserve the foundation having been won, he then back a campaign to fund and implement its restoration. He was a major force in the so-called , which was a political backlash against centralising tendencies within and beyond Grisons. \n\nDecurtins was a leading force in the Romansh revival. He was a co-founder of the \"Romania\" language association and producer of the \"Rätoromanischen Chrestomathie\", a 13 volume collection of Romansh literature and folk tales. He was also the driving force in the long running which came to a head in 1900. He had arranged for the young priest, , to produce a volume of \"Christian soul food\" (\"christliche Gesinnungsstoff\") for the local schools school. It included a German translation of the story of , an eighth century hermit credited with having founded what became Disentis Abbey. The book was introduced to the school replacing a German version of \"Robinson Crusoe\" which Decurtins dismissed as \"lightweight\" (\"zu seicht\"). Then, in 1899 a version of the Sigisbert story, \"Sigisbert en Rezia\", was produced in Romansh. However, Sigisbert came up against the modernising agenda of the education administrators in the cantonal capital, Chur, who had implemented a major school reform in 1890, following the precepts of the influential education reformers Johann Friedrich Herbart and . It turned out that the prescriptive cantonal reforms included Robinson Crusoe, internationally admired at the time for his civilising credentials. Decurtins led support for the Sigisbert text in a sustained campaign that culminated in a mass meeting in the public assembly place in the main square at Ilanz (in the local language, \"plaz cumin\"). 2,700 people gathered, including 27 school governors, demanding use of the Sigisbert text and, at the same time, a pay increase for the teachers. The cantonal government backed down. Sigisbert was restored to the curriculum and the teachers received a pay increase. \n\nIn 1889 Decurtins worked with his friend over the establishment of a University at Fribourg along the Franco-German language frontier to the west of Bern, described by one source as the university's \"spiritual father\", and according to another, personally interviewing and recruiting a number of the university's first professors. Although he remained a member of the national parliament till 1904, the tide of election results nationally during the 1890s was moving increasingly against his catholic conservative group, and he himself embarked on a parallel career teaching at the university where he was a professor till 1914. As a university professor he taught art history and was noted for his dislike of \"modernism\". \n"}

{"id": "2019081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2019081", "title": "Entertainment-Education", "text": "Entertainment-Education\n\nEntertainment-Education is a communication strategy that aims to alleviate a social issue or educate the public through a custom-tailored piece of entertainment. It is defined by a set of techniques and methodologies which all aim to use various levels of mass media to communicate social and behavior change.\n\nIn 1950, the UK-based radio soap opera The Archers broke ground by being specifically designed to educate the British people about farming issues and to help increase productivity in the postwar era of rationing and food shortages. It is the longest-running Soap Opera in the world, and is still broadcast today with millions of listeners.\n\nMiguel Sabido, a Mexican TV producer, further formalized the field. He initially called it \"Entertainment with a proven social benefit\" in the 1960s, which Everett Rogers re-branded as \"Entertainment and Education\" in 1979, and Patrick Coleman simplified as \"Entertainment-Education\", which is the presently used term. \n\nWhile the field has evolved in the last 50 years, it is still strongly based on Sabido's specific approach. Nowadays, many practitioners in Entertainment-Education come from a background of public health, health communication and behavior change communication. \n\nSabido pioneered his method in 1967 by leveraging the Mexican tabloid \"Casos de Alarma\" to encourage readers to join the social security system of Mexico. The release of the Peruvian telenovela \"Simplemente María\" (1969) validated his assumptions about using mass media for social change, as the sale of sewing machines increased dramatically after the telenovela aired. Sabido went on to produce \"Ven conmigo\", which was widely successful with a 32 point share and resulted in a million people enrolling in the adult education system of Mexico after the series' 1-year runtime. The Sabido-produced, family planning-themed telenovelas \"Acompáñame\", \"Vamos juntos\", \"caminemos\" and \"Nosotros los Mujeres\" followed soon after in the 1970s, which collectively resulted in a 34 percent decline of the population growth rate of Mexico.\n\nThe United Nations awarded Mexico with their Population Prize after that run; United States Agency for International Development's Thomas Donnelly wrote: \"The Televisa family planning soap operas have made the single most powerful contribution to the Mexican population success story.\" David Poindexter of Population Communications International saw great promise in this approach, and introduced him to US-American psychologist Albert Bandura. Bandura was able to explain some of Sabido's enormous impact through his social learning theory and later went on to publish many papers on the effects of serial (radio and television) dramas.\n\nIn a series of strategic meetings in the 1970s and 80s, Poindexter invited Sabido to teach his method world-wide in India, China, the Philippines, Egypt, and the Netherlands. Together with Sonny Fox, the president of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, they then organized so-called \"Soap Summits\" that brought together the CEOs of large American broadcasters, as well as introduce American TV writers to the methods of Entertainment-Education.\nSince the early days in the 1980s, a number of organizations have flourished, led by Poindexter-heritage non-profits PCI Media and Population Media Center on the actively producing side, jointly having made 140 shows that reached more than 2 Billion people and had enormous impact on prevention of HIV/AIDS, family planning and women's rights.\n\nIn an effort to systematize health communications in Hollywood content, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention teamed up with USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, jointly creating Hollywood, Health and Society. HH&S advises Writers Guild of America West writers in the inclusion of health-related topics in mainstream television and film.\n"}
{"id": "1342176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1342176", "title": "Film-out", "text": "Film-out\n\nFilm-out is the process in the computer graphics, video production and filmmaking disciplines of transferring images or animation from videotape or digital files to a traditional film print. \"Film-out\" is a broad term that encompasses the conversion of frame rates, color correction, as well as the actual printing, also called scanning or recording.\n\nThe film-out process is different depending on the regional standard of the master videotape in question – NTSC, PAL, or SECAM – or likewise on the several emerging region-independent formats of high definition video (HD video); thus each type is covered separately, taking into account regional film-out industries, methods and technical considerations.\n\nMany modern documentaries and low-budget films are shot on videotape or other digital video media, instead of film stock, and completed as digital video. Video production means substantially lower costs than 16 mm or 35 mm film production on all levels. Until recently, the relatively low cost of video ended when the issue of a theatrical presentation was raised, which required a print for film projection. With the growing presence of digital projection, this is becoming less of a factor.\n\nFilm-out of standard-definition video – or any source that has an incompatible frame rate – is the up-conversion of video media to film for theatrical viewing. The video-to-film conversion process consists of two major steps: first, the conversion of video into digital \"film frames\" which are then stored on a computer or on HD videotape; and secondly, the printing of these digital \"film frames\" onto actual film. To understand these two steps, it is important to understand how video and film differ.\n\nFilm (sound film, at least) has remained unchanged for almost a century and creates the illusion of moving images through the rapid projection of still images, \"frames\", upon a screen, typically 24 per second. Traditional interlaced SD video has no real frame rate, (though the term \"frame\" is applied to video, it has a different meaning). Instead, video consists of a very fast succession of horizontal lines that continually cascade down the television screen – streaming top to bottom, before jumping back to the top and then streaming down to the bottom again, repeatedly, almost 60 alternating screen-fulls every second for NTSC, or exactly 50 such screen-fulls per second for PAL and SECAM. Since visual movement in video is infused in this continuous cascade of scans lines, there is no discrete image or real \"frame\" that can be identified at any one time. Therefore, when transferring video to film, it is necessary to \"invent\" individual film frames, 24 for every second of elapsed time. The bulk of the work done by a film-out company is this first step, creating film frames out of the stream of interlaced video.\n\nEach company employs its own (often proprietary) technology for turning interlaced video into high-resolution digital video files of 24 discrete images every second, called 24 progressive video or 24p. The technology must filter out all the visually unappealing artifacting that results from the inherent mismatch between video and film movement. Moreover, the conversion process usually requires human intervention at every edit point of a video program, so that each type of scene can be calibrated for maximum visual quality. The use of archival footage in video especially calls for extra attention.\n\nStep two, the scanning to film, is the rote part of the process. This is the mechanical step where lasers print each of the newly created frames of the 24p video, stored on computer files or HD videotape, onto rolls of film.\n\nMost companies that do film-out, do all the stages of the process themselves for a lump sum. The job includes converting interlaced video into 24p and often a color correction session – (calibrating the image for theatrical projection), before scanning to physical film, (possibly followed by color correction of the film print made from the digital intermediary) – is offered. At the very least, film-out can be understood as the process of converting interlaced video to 24p and then scanning it to film.\n\nNTSC is the most challenging of the formats when it comes to standards conversion and, specifically, converting to film prints. NTSC runs at the approximate rate of 29.97 video \"frames\" (consisting of two interlaced screen-fulls of scan lines, called fields, per frame) per second. In this way, NTSC resolves actual live action movement at almost – but not quite – 60 alternating half-resolution images every second. Because of this 29.97 rate, no direct correlation to film frames at 24 frames per second can be achieved. NTSC is hardest to reconcile with film, thus motivates its own unique processes.\n\nPAL and SECAM run at 25 interlaced video \"frames\" per second, which can be slowed down or frame-dropped, then deinterlaced, to correlate \"frame\" for frame with film running at 24 actual frames per second. PAL and SECAM are less complex and demanding than NTSC for film-out. PAL and SECAM conversions do agitate, though, with the unpleasant choice between slowing down video (and audio pitch, noticeably) by four percent, from 25 to 24 frames per second, in order to maintain a 1:1 frame match, slightly changing the rhythm and feel of the program; or maintaining original speed by periodically dropping frames, thereby creating jerkiness and possible loss of vital detail in fast-moving action or precise edits.\n\nHigh definition digital video can be shot at a variety of frame rates, including 29.97 interlaced (like NTSC) or progressive; or 25 interlaced (like PAL) or progressive; or even 24-progressive (just like film). HD, if shot in 24-progressive, scans nearly perfectly to film without the need of a frame or field conversion process. Other issues remain though, based on the different resolutions, color spaces, and compression schemes that exist in the high-definition video world.\n\nArtists working with CGI-Computer-generated imagery animation computers create pictures frame by frame. Once the finished product is done, the frames are outputted, normally in a DPX file. These picture data files can then be put on to film using a film recorder for film out. SGI computers started the high-end CGI-Computer-generated imagery animation stystems, but with faster computers and the growth of Linux-based systems, many others are on the market now. \"Toy Story\", and \"Tarzan\" are two samples of movies which were made in CGI and then film-out. The most CGI work is done in 2K Display resolution files (about the size of QXGA), but 4K Display resolution is on the rise. A 2K movie requires a Storage Area Network storage several terabytes in size to be properly stored and played out.\n\nComputer graphics files are handled the same way but in single frames and may use DPX, TIFF or other file formats.\n\nFilm-out-recording is the last step of digital intermediate work flow. DPX files that were scanned on a motion picture film scanner are stored on a storage area network (often abbreviated as \"SAN\"). The scanned DPX footage is edited and composited-FX on workstations, then mastered back on film. Film restoration is also done this way.\n\nThe days of newspapers and magazines shooting 35mm film are almost gone. Digital cameras can now shoot all the images needed, storing them as files (e.g. JPEG, DPX or another format) that are readily edited prior to use. Once the final copy is approved, it can be filmed out for publishing. Digital stills are not the only way to get pictures used in the graphic design and print industries. Film scanners and computer graphics programs are also common sources for graphic design and print industries.\n\n\nLately it has become possible to transfer video images, including films scanned at high resolution, back to film stocks by making a digital intermediate, which can then be recorded out to fine-grain film intermediate with a laser film printer. The first major live-action film to use this process entirely was \"O Brother Where Art Thou\", done by Kodak's Cinesite division in Hollywood in the spring of 2000. Prior to this, the video master was transferred from tape to film through one of several methods: CRT recorder, laser film printer, Kinescope, or electron beam recorder (EBR). Theater performances have been preserved with Kinescope for many years – the 1964 New York production of \"Hamlet\" with Richard Burton, for example, was shot on video and printed as a film that was released in movie theaters using this process. Fernando Arrabal was the first to use the technique of video-to-film for aesthetic purposes, for the 1971 film \"Viva la muerte\", which used heavily color-adjusted video footage only for the fantasy sequences. Experimental filmmaker Scott Bartlett also utilized video footage and effects for portions of his 1972 film \"OffOn\", by filming such with a 16 mm film camera off of a video monitor.\n\nTechnicolor also experimented in the early 1970s with using video gear & videotape to make feature-length motion pictures with, by transferring the videotape to film for final release and distribution. Films made with this process were the 1973 film \"Why\", the 1971 film \"The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler\", and the most famous film using this process, Frank Zappa's 1971 film \"200 Motels\", which was originally shot on 2 inch Quadruplex videotape, and then transferred to film by Technicolor, being the first independent film originally to be shot on videotape and distributed theatrically in 35 mm.\n\nAlso, countless educational, medical, industrial, and promotional videotapes produced from the late 1950s up to the mid-1980s were also transferred to film stock (usually 16 mm film) for widespread distribution, using either an EBR or CRT recorder. This was done due to VCRs and VTRs then not being commonplace in most schools, hospitals, boardrooms, and other institutional settings, due to their high cost and the multitudes of proprietary (and incompatible) open-reel, cartridge, & cassette videotape formats in the early years of industrial-market videotape recorders starting in the mid-to-late 1960s. But 16 mm projectors were widely available at the time in such settings, making distribution of such video productions on 16 mm film more practical. One company that specialized in the transfer of videotape-originated programming to 16mm film in the 1970s and 1980s was Image Transform, a company that specialized in and developed its own technologies for video-to-film transfer. Such transfers were the case until the mid-1980s, when the VCR became affordable enough (and much more standardized in the form of VHS and Betamax) to be adopted in such institutional settings on a widespread basis.\n\nDigital video equipment has made this approach easier; theatrical-release documentaries and features originated on video are now being produced this way. High Definition video became popular in the early 2000s by pioneering filmmakers like George Lucas and Robert Rodriguez, who used HD video cameras (such as the Sony HDW-F900) to capture images for popular movies like \"\" and \"Spy Kids 2\", respectively, both released in 2002.\n\nIndependent filmmakers, especially those participating in the Dogme movement of filmmaking, have also shot their films on MiniDV videotape, to be transferred to 35 mm film stock for theatrical release. Some examples of independent movies being shot on videotape are Lone Scherfig's \"Italian For Beginners\" (a Dogme film), Steven Soderbergh's \"Full Frontal\" (which was shot on PAL-standard MiniDV gear in the normally NTSC-prevalent US, due to its higher resolution of 625 lines and frame rate of 25 frame/s (as opposed to NTSC's 525 line resolution and 30 frame/s frame rate), more closely matching film's 24 frame/s), and Mike Figgis' \"Timecode\". Initially due to budgetary concerns, Filmmaker Rob Nilsson shot his feature drama \"Signal 7\" in 1984 using Sony portable U-matic format videocassette decks paired with Ikegami HL-79 3-tube broadcast video cameras (a setup comparable to ENG systems used by broadcast television stations at the time). The video hardware & taped footage took the place of the traditional cinema camera and it's negatives, which were edited in post-production and transferred to 35mm film for theatrical release & exhibition. Nilsson liked the visual look of video-to-film transfer, and shot several other of his films the same way.\n\nArrilaser film recorders are also used for film-out.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "162977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162977", "title": "Finland Swedish", "text": "Finland Swedish\n\nFinland Swedish or Fenno-Swedish (, ) is a general term for the variety of Standard Swedish and a closely related group of dialects of Swedish spoken in Finland by the Swedish-speaking population as their first language. For the most part, these dialects and the dialects spoken in Sweden are mutually intelligible, although some archaic Swedish dialects in Ostrobothnia are practically unintelligible to Swedish-speaking people in southern Finland (and in Sweden). Most Swedish-speaking Finns emphasize that Finland Swedish is not a language separate from the Swedish of Sweden. The Swedish dialects in Finland are considered varieties of Swedish, and the norm for written Standard Swedish is completely applicable also for Finland Swedish. Today, Swedish dialects are spoken in four different regions in Finland: Ostrobothnia, Åland Islands, Southwest Finland and Uusimaa.\n\nSwedish as spoken in Finland is regulated by the Swedish Department of the Institute for the Languages of Finland. This regulation includes the officially stated aim of keeping Finland Swedish close to the Swedish as spoken in Sweden and strongly phrased advice against loanwords and calques from Finnish, which are usually incomprehensible to Swedes.\n\nAn often repeated \"fact\" is that the municipality with the highest proportion of Swedish speakers in the world, Larsmo (93% ), is located in Finland. Korsnäs has also held this title and is often cited as such. However, as there are no official statistics on the mother tongue of inhabitants of Sweden, this is hard or impossible to verify. In addition bilingualism is very common for immigrants in Sweden, so the term \"Swedish-speaking\" may be diffuse in that sense.\n\nIn the spoken vernacular, especially among young people in Finnish-dominated areas, Finnish loanwords as well as calques from Finnish are frequently incorporated into Finland Swedish. There are also some words in Finland Swedish that would be considered slightly archaic in Sweden. Some government and public service terms that have been created in recent centuries also differ. The same is true of other new words, notably loanwords from English.\n\nA common misconception among many Swedes is that Finland Swedish is simply Swedish spoken with a Finnish accent, something that can be a considerable source of frustration to most native Swedish-speakers in Finland. Any language adopts features, especially pronunciation habits, from dominant languages it comes in touch with, but many of the traits of Finland Swedish exist also in monolingual areas and some are in fact preserved features of old Swedish, as with Scots in comparison with English, Afrikaans in comparison with Dutch, or Galician and Brazilian and African dialects in comparison with modern mainland European Portuguese.\n\nFrom the 16th century, Swedish was the main language of jurisdiction, administration and higher education in Finland (which was then a part of Sweden), but the majority of the population in the Finnish inland spoke Finnish outside of these sectors of society, i.e. in normal, daily life. In 1809, when Finland was conquered by the Russian Empire and became an autonomous Grand Duchy, Swedish remained the only official language. In 1863, both Finnish and Swedish became official languages with equal status, and by the time of Finland's independence in 1917, after a Finnicization campaign by the Fennoman movement, Finnish clearly dominated in government and society. See further: Finland's language strife.\n\nFinland has since then been a bilingual country with a Swedish-speaking minority (5.6% of mainland Finland's population in 2006) living mostly in the coastal areas of southern, south-western, and western Finland. During the 20th century, the urbanization following the Industrial Revolution has led to large majorities of Finnish speakers in all major cities. The capital Helsinki (in Swedish Helsingfors) became predominantly Finnish-speaking as recently as around 1900. A large and important part of the Swedish-speaking population nevertheless lives in the capital.\n\nThe autonomous island province of Åland is an exception, being monolingually Swedish-speaking according to international treaties. It is a matter of definition whether the Swedish dialects spoken on Åland are to be considered a kind of Finland Swedish or not. Most Swedish-speaking Finns and linguists consider them to be closer to some of the dialects spoken in nearby parts of Sweden.\n\nSwedish is one of the two national languages of the republic of Finland, the other being Finnish. These two languages have formally equal status in nearly all legislation. The other minority languages (such as Sami) are regulated separately.\n\nFinland Swedish is regulated by the Institute for the Languages of Finland. Official Swedish is not supposed to be very different from Swedish as found in Sweden. There are however e.g. words regarded as archaic in Sweden, but commonly used in Finland, and terms that differ from their counterparts in Sweden, often because of slight differences in the related legislation.\n\nBilingualism of municipalities is regulated by the Language Act of 2003. If the minority has increased into at least 3,000 persons or 8% of inhabitants, then the municipality must become bilingual. If the minority has fallen below 3,000 persons and 6% of inhabitants, then the municipality must become monolingual, unless it decides to keep its bilingual status. At present, only one such municipality has done so, namely Lohja (\"Lojo\" in Swedish). The status is reviewed once in a decade, and enacted by a government decree issued by the Finnish Council of State.\n\nThe country's public broadcaster, Yle, provides two Swedish-language radio stations, Yle Vega and Yle X3M. The Swedish-speaking TV channel Yle Fem was merged to Yle Teema in 2017.\n\nWith the exception of the dialects spoken in Ostrobothnia along the west coast, close to the Gulf of Bothnia (example: the dialect spoken in Närpes), Finland Swedish is not particularly different from Central Swedish. The phoneme is more centralized and pronounced like , quite similar to how many American English speakers pronounce /u/ (as in \"moon\"). That should be compared to the Central Swedish , which is very close to the short vowel and is more rounded.\n\nThe highly variable \"sj\" sound varies between and on the Finnish mainland, often close to \"sh\" in English \"shoe\". In the Åland Islands, its realization is similar to the velar (and often labialized) pronunciations of nearby parts of Sweden. The historic \"k\" sound before front vowels and the \"tj\" sound, in modern Central Swedish a fricative , is an affricate or in all Finland Swedish dialects, close to \"ch\" in English \"chin\", except for some Åland Swedish, in which it is a simple fricative.\n\nThe tonal word accent, which distinguishes some minimal pairs in most dialects of Swedish and Norwegian, is not present in Finland Swedish (except around the parish of Snappertuna, west of Helsinki). The so-called \"accent 2\", used mainly in words with a two-syllable root, is not used at all; instead, \"accent 1\" is used in all words. Hence, Sweden Swedish minimal pairs like (\"the duck\") – with stress on only the first syllable – and (\"the spirit\") – with both syllables stressed – are both pronounced in Finland.\n\nFinland Swedish lacks the aspirated stops present in Central Standard Swedish, making the contrast between \"fortis\" and \"lenis\" stops one of voicing only. The retroflexion that occurs in many dialects when /r/ precedes a coronal consonant does not occur in certain pairs in Finland Swedish (e.g. /rt/, which is realized as [ʈ] in Standard Swedish but [rt] in Finland Swedish).\n\nThe sample text is a reading of a section of The North Wind and the Sun.\n\nNordanvinden och solen tvistade en gång om vem av dem som var starkast. Just då kom en vandrare vägen fram insvept i en varm kappa.\n\nFinland Swedish mostly has the same vocabulary as Swedish in Sweden, and there is a conscious effort to adopt neologisms from Sweden, to maintain cohesion between the two varieties. Nevertheless, there are differences, which generally fall into two categories: words now considered archaic in Sweden, and loanwords and calques from Finnish or independently borrowed from other languages (nowadays mostly English). There are also some terms differing because of differing legislation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5167518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5167518", "title": "German conjugation", "text": "German conjugation\n\nGerman verbs are conjugated depending on their use: as in English, they are modified depending on the persons (identity) and number of the subject of a sentence, as well as depending on the tense and mood.\n\nThe citation form of German verbs is the infinitive form, which generally consists of the bare form of the verb with \"-(e)n\" added to the end. To conjugate regular verbs, this is removed and replaced with alternative endings: Radical: mach-\n\nIn general, irregular forms of German verbs exist to make for easier and clearer pronunciation, with a vowel sound in the centre of the word the only part of the word that changes in an unexpected way (though endings may also be slightly different). This modification is often a moving of the vowel sound to one pronounced further forward in the mouth. This process is called the Germanic umlaut. However, a number of verbs including \"sein\" (to be) are fully irregular, as in English \"I am\" and \"I was\" sound completely different.\n\nFor many German tenses, the verb itself is locked in a non-varying form of the infinitive or past participle (which normally starts with \"ge-\") that is the same regardless of the subject, and then joined to an auxiliary verb that is conjugated. This is similar to English grammar, though the primary verb is normally placed at the end of the clause. Note that in both the examples shown below the auxiliary verb is irregular.\n\nThe following tenses and modi are formed by direct conjugation of the verb:\n\nBelow is a paradigm of German verbs, that is, a set of conjugation tables, for the model regular verbs and for some of the most common irregular verbs, including the irregular auxiliary verbs.\n\nGerman verbs have forms for a range of subjects, indicating number and social status:\n\nThe subject does not have to be one of these pronouns, but can instead be anything that has the same person and number. For example, in the sentences \"Der Ball ist rund.\" (\"The ball is round.\") and \"Es ist rund.\" (\"It is round.\"), the verb is in the same form: third-person singular.\n\nIn German, the first-person and third-person plural and second-person plural-polite forms are identical for all verbs in every tense. \"Sie\" in the second person is used to address one or more people of high status.\n\nAs a summary of German tenses, moods and aspects:\n\nThe following tables include only the active simple tenses: those formed by direct conjugation from the verb.\n\nThe ending \"-e\" in the imperative singular is almost obligatorily lost in colloquial usage. In the standard language it may be lost or not: \"lieb!\" or \"liebe!\", \"sag!\" or \"sage!\"\n\nThe ending \"-e\" in the first-person singular of the present is always kept in normal written style (\"ich liebe, ich sage\"), but may also be lost in colloquial usage (\"ich lieb', ich sag\"'). This occurs more often than not in the middle of a sentence, somewhat less frequently if the verb comes to stand in the end of a sentence.\n\nWhen a verb stem ends in \"-el\" or \"-er\", the ending \"-en\" is dropped in favor of \"-n\".\n\nWhen a verb stem ends in \"-t\", an intermediate \"-e-\" is added before most endings to prevent a large consonant cluster.\n\nCertain verbs change their stem vowel for the second-person and third-person singular forms. These usually follow one of three patterns:\n\nCertain verbs change their stem vowels for the preterite indicative and subjunctive. These changes are unique for each verb.\n\nIn modal verbs, the stem vowel will change for all conjugations of the singular simple present. These changes are unique to each verb. In addition, the ending will be missing for the first and third person conjugations of the singular simple present.\n\nIn German, prepositions and modifying prefixes are frequently attached to verbs to alter their meaning. Verbs so formed are divided into separable verbs which detach the prefix under certain circumstances and inseparable verbs which do not. The conjugations are identical to that of the root verb, and the position of the prefix for both separable and inseparable verbs follows a standard pattern. The prefix's effect on the verb is highly unpredictable, so normally the meaning of each new verb has to be learned separately. (See German verbs for further information on the meanings of common prefixes.)\n\nSeparable verbs detach their prefixes in the present, imperfect and imperative. The prefix is placed at the end of the clause. The past participle is the prefix attached to the normal past participle. The infinitive keeps the prefix where it is used, for example in the conditional and future tenses.\n\nInseparable verbs retain the prefix at all times. The past participle has the prefix in place of \"ge-\" but keeps any irregularities of the root verb's past participle.\n\nA number of verbs are separable with one meaning and inseparable with another. For example, \"übersetzen\" means \"to translate\" as an inseparable verb but \"to ferry\" as a separable verb.\n\n"}

{"id": "45273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45273", "title": "Infinite loop", "text": "Infinite loop\n\nAn infinite loop (or endless loop) is a sequence of instructions in a [[computer program]] which loops endlessly, either due to the [[control flow#Loops|loop]] having no terminating condition, having one that can never be met, or one that causes the loop to start over. In older [[operating system]]s with [[cooperative multitasking]], infinite loops normally caused the entire system to become unresponsive. With the now-prevalent preemptive multitasking model, infinite loops usually cause the program to consume all available processor time, but can usually be terminated by the user. [[Busy waiting|Busy wait]] loops are also sometimes called \"infinite loops\". Infinite loops are one possible cause for a computer \"[[hang (computing)|freezing]]\"; others include [[thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]], [[deadlock]], and [[segmentation fault|access violation]]s.\n\nLooping is repeating a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. An infinite loop occurs when the condition will never be met, due to some inherent characteristic of the loop.\n\nThere are a few situations when this is desired behavior. For example, the games on cartridge-based game consoles typically have no exit condition in their main loop, as there is no operating system for the program to exit to; the loop runs until the console is powered off.\n\nModern interactive computers require that the computer constantly be monitoring for user input or device activity, so at some fundamental level there is an infinite processing [[idle loop]] that must continue until the device is turned off or reset. In the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]], for example, this outer loop was contained in the Exec program, and if the computer had absolutely no other work to do it would loop run a dummy job that would simply turn off the \"computer activity\" indicator light.\n\nModern computers also typically do not halt the processor or motherboard circuit-driving clocks when they crash. Instead they fall back to an error condition displaying messages to the operator, and enter an infinite loop waiting for the user to either respond to a prompt to continue, or to reset the device.\n\nIn multi-threaded programs some threads can be executing inside infinite loops without causing the entire program to be stuck in an infinite loop. If the main thread exits all threads of the process are forcefully stopped thus all execution ends and the process/program terminates. The threads inside the infinite loops can perform \"housekeeping\" tasks or they can be in a blocked state waiting for input (from socket/queue) and resume execution every time input is received.\n\nMost often, the term is used for those situations when this is not the intended result; that is, when this is a [[software bug|bug]]. Such errors are most common among novice programmers, but can be made by experienced programmers as well, because their causes can be quite subtle.\n\nOne common cause, for example, is that the programmer intends to iterate over a collection of items such as a [[linked list]], executing the loop code once for each item. Improperly formed links can create a \"reference loop\" in the list, where one list element links to one that occurred earlier in the list. This joins part of the list into a circle, causing the program to loop forever.\n\nWhile most infinite loops can be found by close inspection of the code, there is no \"general\" method to determine whether a given program will ever halt or will run forever; this is the [[undecidable problem|undecidability]] of the [[halting problem]].\n\nAs long as the system is responsive, infinite loops can often be interrupted by sending a signal to the process (such as [[SIGINT (POSIX)|SIGINT]] in Unix), or an [[interrupt]] to the processor, causing the current process to be aborted. This can be done in a [[task manager]], in a terminal with the [[Control-C]] command, or by using the [[kill (command)|kill]] command or [[system call]]. However, this does not always work, as the process may not be responding to signals or the processor may be in an uninterruptible state, such as in the [[Cyrix coma bug]] (caused by overlapping uninterruptible instructions in an [[instruction pipeline]]). In some cases other signals such as [[SIGKILL]] can work, as they do not require the process to be responsive, while in other cases the loop cannot be terminated short of system shutdown.\n\nInfinite loops can be implemented using various [[control flow]] constructs. Most commonly, in unstructured programming this is jump back up ([[goto]]), while in structured programming this is an indefinite loop (while loop) set to never end, either by omitting the condition or explicitly setting it to true, as codice_1.\n\nSome languages have special constructs for infinite loops, typically by omitting the condition from an indefinite loop. Examples include Ada (codice_2), Fortran (codice_3), Go (codice_4), and Ruby (codice_5).\n\nA simple example (in [[C (programming language)|C]]):\nThe form codice_6 for an infinite loop is traditional, appearing in the standard reference \"[[The C Programming Language]]\", and is often punningly pronounced \"forever\".\n\nThis is a loop that will print \"Infinite Loop\" without halting.\n\nA similar example in 1980s-era [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]]:\nA similar example in [[X86 assembly language]]:\nAnother example is in [[DOS]]\n\nHere the loop is quite obvious, as the last line unconditionally sends execution back to the first.\n\nAn example in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]\nAn example in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]\nAn example in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]\nAn example in [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]]\nAn example in [[Perl 5]]\nAn example in [[Perl 6]]\nAn example in [[JavaScript]]\n\nHere is one example of an infinite loop in [[Visual Basic]]:\n\nThis creates a situation where codice_7 will never be greater than 5, since at the start of the loop code codice_7 is given the value of 1, thus, the loop will always end in 2 and the loop will never break. This could be fixed by moving the codice_9 instruction outside the loop. Essentially what this infinite loop does is to instruct a computer to keep on adding 1 to 1 until 5 is reached. Since 1+1 always equals 2, this will never happen.\n\nIn some languages, programmer confusion about the mathematical symbols may lead to an unintentional infinite loop. For example, here is a snippet in [[C (programming language)|C]]:\nThe expected output is the numbers 0 through 9, with an interjected \"a equals 5!\" between 5 and 6. However, in the line \"codice_10\" above, the programmer has confused the = (assignment) operator with the == (equality test) operator. Instead, this will assign the value of 5 to codice_11 at this point in the program. Thus, codice_11 will never be able to advance to 10, and this loop cannot terminate.\n\nUnexpected behavior in evaluating the terminating condition can also cause this problem. Here is an example (in [[C (programming language)|C]]):\n\nOn some systems, this loop will execute ten times as expected, but on other systems it will never terminate. The problem is that the loop terminating condition (x != 1.1) tests for exact equality of two [[floating point]] values, and the way floating point values are represented in many computers will make this test fail, because they cannot represent the value 1.1 exactly.\n\nThe same can happen in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:\nBecause of the likelihood of tests for equality or not-equality failing unexpectedly, it is safer to use greater-than or less-than tests when dealing with floating-point values. For example, instead of testing whether codice_7 equals 1.1, one might test whether (x <= 1.0), or (x < 1.1), either of which would be certain to exit after a finite number of iterations. Another way to fix this particular example would be to use an [[integer (computer science)|integer]] as a [[control flow|loop index]], counting the number of iterations that have been performed.\n\nA similar problem occurs frequently in [[numerical analysis]]: in order to compute a certain result, an iteration is intended to be carried out until the error is smaller than a chosen tolerance. However, because of rounding errors during the iteration, the specified tolerance can never be reached, resulting in an infinite loop.\n\n[[File:Google Home vs. Amazon Echo.webm|thumb|Video of infinite loop by Google Home vs. Amazon Echo]]\nAlthough infinite loops in a single program are usually easy to predict, a loop caused by several entities interacting is much harder to foresee. Consider a server that always replies with an error message if it does not understand the request. Apparently, there is no possibility for an infinite loop in the server, but if there are two such servers (A and B), and A receives a message of unknown type from B, then A replies with an error message to B, B does not understand the error message and replies to A with its own error message, A does not understand the error message from B and sends yet another error message, and so on \"ad infinitum.\" One common example of such situation is an [[email loop]].\nAn example of an email loop is if someone receives mail from a no reply inbox, but their auto-response is on. They will reply to the no reply inbox, triggering the \"this is a no reply inbox\" response. This will be sent to the user, who then sends an auto reply to the no-reply inbox, and so on and so forth.\n\nA pseudo-infinite loop is a loop that appears infinite but is really just a very long loop.\n\nAn example in [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]]:\n\nAn example [[for loop]] in [[C (programming language)|C]]:\n\nIt appears that this will go on indefinitely, but in fact the value of codice_14 will eventually reach the maximum value storable in an codice_15 and adding 1 to that number will wrap-around to 0, breaking the loop. The actual limit of codice_14 depends on the details of the system and [[compiler]] used. With [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], this loop would continue until the computer's [[memory (computers)|memory]] could no longer contain codice_14. If codice_14 was a signed integer, rather than an unsigned integer, overflow would be undefined. In this case, the loop could be optimized into an infinite loop.\n\nInfinite recursion is a special case of an infinite loop that is caused by [[recursion]]. \n\nThe following example in VBA returns a [[stack overflow]] error:\nThe most trivial example of this is the term Ω in the [[lambda calculus]], shown below in [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]:\n\nΩ is an infinite recursion, and therefore has no [[normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal form]]. When using [[structural recursion]], infinite recursions are usually caused by a missing base case or by a faulty inductive step. An example of such a faulty structural recursion:\n\nThe function \"sum-from-1-to\" will run out of [[stack-based memory allocation|stack space]], because the recursion never stops — it is infinite.

It is similar in meaning to the English word \"Hello!\".\n\nSpecifically, Jambo is a Swahili language class 5-6 word which are part of the \"collectives\" or dialogic actions among groups of people. Jambo primarily means 'affair.' The English word \"affair\" not used in the sexual connotation, but in the commercial, professional, public or personal business definition.\n\nEtymologically it is from amba (-amba) from to say, ultimately from etyl. It is a cognate with Zulu. Secondary meanings include as dealing with a thing, issue or matter.\n\nThe spoken word \"Jambo\" was once used as a greeting among traders of the Swahili coast of southeast Africa. While less formal, it is in widespread use in East Africa and beyond. While similar to the English word Hello, it really meant to come and settle ones affairs in the business sense. It was used by traders from India, China and other lands before the Portuguese Vasco da Gama visited the area in 1498. It is in current use.\n\nDuring the European \"Scramble for Africa\" which brought a period of \"Imperialism\" and East African European colonialism, the Swahili word \"Bwana\" was used to refer to the Europeans. Briefly the word today refers to as \"Mister\" or big boss or an important person and occasionally used in a derogatory manner. But the historical reality it was simply \"Master.\" The British dictionary or older English usage refers the word \"Master\" as a male person who is in charge of others or of a task. In many ways in East Africa the combined phrase \"Jambo Bwana!\" (Hello, Master!) became viewed as \"Hello, Slave Driver\" or \"Hello, Slave Master\" by those seeking independence especially in Colonial East Africa.\n\nAfter independence and over a half century of Independence, many still use the word \"Jambo!\" And some enterprising East Africans use the old imperialist welcoming phrase \"Jambo Bwana!\" as a welcome greeting seeking tourist dollars.\n\n\"Jambo Bwana!\" (translated as \"Hello Mister!\"), is also notably one of the best internationally known Kenyan hotel pop songs. That welcoming song, with some local variations including the informal name of the \"Jambo! Jambo!\", is sometimes used to greet visitors to Kenya.\n\nToday, more traditional greeting or welcoming terms are encouraged for tourists to better understand and to relate to the local people. For example: In Tanzania and for the Swahili language, there are many tourist guides and educational pages which provide common phrases. Below are four basic ways in Swahili to say \"Hello!\" and a basic polite reply after the dash.\n\n1. Hujambo - more correct than Jambo! (how are you?) – Sijambo (seeJAmbo) (I am fine / no worries) <br>\n2. Habari? (any news?) – nzuri (nZOOree) (fine) <br>\n3. U hali gani? (oo HAlee GAnee) (how are you) – njema (fine) <br>\n4. Shikamoo (a young person to an elder) – marahaba\n\n\"Jambo\" is also used as a surname in southeast Africa. For example, Zhaimu Jambo (born 23 August 1987 in Harare), aka \"Jimmy\", is a retired Zimbabwean footballer (soccer player).\n\nThe word jambo has found its way into different cultures and languages. For example, the word Jamboree (scouting). This is the Swahili word Jambo used in English, as a borrowed foreign word, with the ending -ree. The word Jamboree is a transitive verb with a direct action of the primary word Jambo. For example, an attendee of a Jambo is a Jamboree. The word \"Jamboree\" is used primarily by the Scouting program before the first Boy Scout \"Jamboree\" in 1920. The word has also come to mean \"a lavish or boisterous celebration or party.\" Another example of a transitive word is \"transferee\" which the person receiving a transfer (money or goods) is the transfer-ree dropping the extra r. In contrast the person giving the transfer is the \"transferor.\" Such transitive words are still used in formal terms dealing in legal affairs.\n\n"}

{"id": "32722438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32722438", "title": "Kinnui", "text": "Kinnui\n\nA kinnui () or kinui (translated as \"nickname\") is the secular name held by Jewish people in relation to the language spoken by the country they reside in, differing from their Biblical Hebrew name.\n\nThe religious name is in Hebrew (for example, Moses ben Maimon; Joseph ben Gershon; Shlomeh Arieh ben David HaLevi; Gershom ben Judah; Devorah bat Avraham), and the secular name is in whatever language is in use in the geographic locality (for example, Isaiah Berlin; Solomon Lyon Barnard; Sigmund Freud; Golda Meir; Etta Cone ).\n\nWhen Jews arrived in a new country, a secular name was often chosen from the local language. In Central and Eastern Europe, Yiddish was the secular language, so a Hebrew name was used in religious and Jewish community contexts and a Yiddish name was used (the kinnui) in secular contexts. In France, the secular name was in French; in Spain in Spanish, in North Africa and the middle East in Arabic, in ancient Babylon, the kinnui was in Babylonian and so on. Some kinnuim (the Hebrew plural of \"Kinnui\") are based on synonyms (words that have the same or similar meaning but are spelled differently); for example, Mikhail = Yekhiel; Menahem = Mendel; Asher = Anshel. Some Kinnuim represent the ancestral tribes of Israel, referencing the animal-like attributes of four of the sons of Jacob and one of his grandsons: Judah, the lion (e.g. the family name Lyon, Loewe); Benjamin, the wolf (e.g. the family name Woolf); Naftali, the deer (e.g. the family names Hirsch, Hersch, Harris); and Issachar, the ass (or the bear) (e.g. the family names Bar, Baer, Barell, Barnard, Bernhardt, Berthold, Schulter ); plus Ephraim, the fish (e.g. the family name Fish).\n\nThe Austrian Emperor Joseph II Habsburg, who controlled a substantial part of Europe in the late 18th century, was the first head of government in Europe to require Jews to register a permanent family surname. His decree required (on pain of substantial fines for non-compliance) that this surname be (or, at least, sound like) German. A translation of this 1787 decree is published on the Polish-Jewish genealogy website Shoreshim. Thus, Jews were compelled to take surnames with a German sound, and usually, they could not choose them. These arbitrary family names generally had no relationship with either the trade or craft, nor the physical attributes, nor the geographic origin of the persons so named. For example, Schwarz, Klug, Weiss, Gross, Klein, Fein and Roth. There are also many names formed with two German roots such as Morgenstern, Morgenstein, Apfelbaum, Birnbaum, Rosenberg, Rosenblum, Rosenbaum, Weinbaum, Weinberg, Bernstein. The spelling of these names varied considerably, especially when they migrated through Poland or Russia. The frequency of German surnames for Jews in the Russian Empire may be due to migration from Western Europe.\n\nSubsequently, in 1808, Napoleon returned from victories in Germany and proclaimed the religious freedom of the Jews, granting them political rights in France. He also demanded that all Jews within his empire take a family name. Many Jews were still known only by a Hebrew name or \"shem hakodesh\" (hakodesh meaning \"the sacred\"; shem meaning \"name\") for example, Yaakov ben Yehudah. Under this directive, many Jews took names derived from towns where they traded, such as Hamburger, Berliner, Mainz or Frankfurter, while others used occupations as names such as Miller, Schuster, Schneider, Cantor or Bronfenbrenner. Others used characteristics, such as Friedman, or used a patronymic or tribal name such as Jacobs or Benjamin. When Napoleon conquered Westphalen, a German principality, he imposed these regulations on the Germans as well.\n\nAmong Arabic-speaking Jews, Arabic names were adopted, such as Ḥassan, Abdallah, Sahl; or Hebrew names were translated into Arabic, for example, Eleazar into Manẓur, Ovadia into Abdallah, Maẓliaḥ into Maimun. \"Ibn\" (analogous to the Hebrew \"ben\") was used to form a family name. Examples of this formula are Ibn Aknin, Ibn Danan, Ibn Laṭif. In the Jews of Arab lands a linguistic mixing happened and names appear with both Hebrew and Arabic elements in the same name, for example, Abraham Ibn Ezra. A peculiarity of the Arabic names is the kunyah, the by-name given to a father after the birth of his son, by which the father is named after the son (using the prefix \"Abu\"). For example Abu al-Walid is a kunyah for the father of a son named Jonah. \"Abu\" also forms family names, as in the case of Abudarham, or Aboab. The Arabic article \"al\" appears in quite a number of names, as in Al-Ḥarisi.\n\nThe secular name is the name that appears in civil documents. The \"shem hakodesh\" usually appears only in connection with Jewish religious observances, for example, a record of circumcision (brit), in a marriage contract (ketubah ), a writ of divorce (get) or on a memorial stone.\n"}

{"id": "319743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=319743", "title": "Machado de Assis", "text": "Machado de Assis\n\nJoaquim Maria Machado de Assis (), often known by his surnames as Machado de Assis, \"Machado,\" or \"Bruxo do Cosme Velho\" (21 June 1839 – 29 September 1908), was a pioneer Brazilian novelist, poet, playwright and short story writer. Widely regarded as the greatest writer of Brazilian literature, nevertheless he did not gain widespread popularity outside Brazil in his own lifetime. In 1897 he founded and became the first President of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. He was multilingual, having taught himself French, English, German and Greek in later life. \n\nMachado's works had a great influence on Brazilian literary schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1941, the Brazilian Academy of Letters founded in his honor the Prêmio Machado de Assis (Machado de Assis Award), the most prestigious literary award in Brazil. For his innovation and audacity in early themes, Assis is often seen as a writer of unprecedented production, being known for his irony and wide vocabulary. Among his most famous works are \"Dom Casmurro\" (1899), \"Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas\" (\"Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas\", also translated as \"Epitaph of a Small Winner\") and \"Quincas Borba\" (also known in English as \"Philosopher or Dog?\"). Machado de Assis was included on American literary critic Harold Bloom's list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature; and although Machado de Assis was of mixed ethnicity, Bloom considers him the greatest black writer in Western literature.\n\nJoaquim Maria Machado de Assis was born on 21 June 1839 in Rio de Janeiro, then capital of the Empire of Brazil. His parents were Francisco José de Assis, a mulatto wall painter, the son of freed slaves, and Maria Leopoldina da Câmara Machado, an Azorean Portuguese washerwoman. He was born in Livramento country house, owned by \"Dona\" Maria José de Mendonça Barroso Pereira, widow of senator Bento Barroso Pereira, who protected his parents and allowed them to live with her. \"Dona\" Maria José became Joaquim's godmother; her brother-in-law, commendatory Joaquim Alberto de Sousa da Silveira, was his godfather, and both were paid homage by giving their names to the baby. Machado had a sister who died young. Joaquim studied in a public school, but was not a good student. While helping to serve masses, he met Father Silveira Sarmento, who became his Latin teacher and also a good friend.\n\nWhen Joaquim was ten years old, his mother died, and his father took him along as he moved to São Cristóvão, Sergipe. Francisco de Assis met the mulatta Maria Inês da Silva, and they married in 1854. Joaquim had classes in a school for girls only, thanks to his stepmother who worked there making candies. At night he learned French with an immigrant baker. In his adolescence, he met the mulatto Francisco de Paulo Brito, who owned a bookstore, a newspaper and typography. On 12 January 1855, Francisco de Paula published the poem \"Ela\" (\"She\") written by Joaquim, then 15 years old, in the newspaper \"Marmota Fluminense\". In the following year, he was hired as typographer's apprentice in the \"Imprensa Oficial\" (the Official Press, charged with the publication of Government measures), where he was encouraged as a writer by Manuel Antônio de Almeida, the newspaper's director and also a novelist. There he also met Francisco Otaviano, journalist and later liberal senator, and Quintino Bocaiúva, who decades later would become known for his role as a republican orator.\n\nFrancisco Otaviano hired Machado to work on the newspaper \"Correio Mercantil\" as a proofreader in 1858. He continued to write for the \"Marmota Fluminense\" and also for several other newspapers, but he did not earn much and had a humble life. As he did not live with his father anymore, it was common for him to eat only once a day for lack of money.\n\nAround this time, he became a friend of the writer and liberal politician José de Alencar, who taught him English. From English literature, he was influenced by Laurence Sterne, William Shakespeare, Lord Byron and Jonathan Swift. He learned German years later and in his old age, Greek. He was invited by Bocaiúva to work at his newspaper \"Diário do Rio de Janeiro\" in 1860. Machado had a passion for theater and wrote several plays for a short time; his friend Bocaiúva concluded: \"Your works are meant to be read and not played.\" He gained some notability and began to sign his writings as J. M. Machado de Assis, the way he would be known for posterity: Machado de Assis.\n\nHis father Francisco de Assis died in 1864. Machado learned of his father's death through acquaintances. He dedicated his compilation of poems called \"Crisálidas\" to his father: \"To the Memory of Francisco José de Assis and Maria Leopoldina Machado de Assis, my Parents.\" With the Liberal Party's ascension to power about that time, Machado thought he might receive a patronage position that would help him improve his life. To his surprise, aid came from the Emperor Dom Pedro II, who hired him as director-assistant in the \"Diário Oficial\" in 1867, and knighted him as an honor. In 1888 Machado was made an officer of the Order of the Rose.\n\nIn 1868 Machado met the Portuguese Carolina Augusta Xavier de Novais, five years older than him. She was the sister of his colleague Faustino Xavier de Novais, for whom he worked on the magazine \"O Futuro\". Afflicted with a stammer, Machado was extremely shy, short and lean, but he was very intelligent and well learned. He married Carolina on 12 November 1869; although her parents Miguel and Adelaide, and her siblings disapproved because Machado was mulatto and she was of purely European ancestry. They had no children.\n\nMachado managed to rise in his bureaucratic career, first in the Agriculture Department. Three years later, he became the head of a section in it. He published two poetry books: \"Falenas\", in 1870, and \"Americanas\", in 1875. Their weak reception made him explore other literary genres.\n\nHe wrote five romantic novels: \"Ressurreição\", \"A Mão e Luva\", \"Helena\" and \"Iaiá Garcia\". The books were a success with the public, but literary critics considered them mediocre. Machado suffered repeated attacks of epilepsy, apparently related to hearing of the death of his old friend José de Alencar. He was left melancholic, pessimistic and fixed on death. His next book, marked by \"a skeptical and realistic tone\": \"Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas\" (Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas, also translated as \"Epitaph of a Small Winner\"), is widely considered a masterpiece. By the end of the 1880s, Machado had gained wide renown as a writer.\n\nAlthough he was opposed to slavery, he never spoke against it in public. He avoided discussing politics. He was criticized by the abolitionist José do Patrocínio and by the writer Lima Barreto for staying away from politics, especially the cause of abolition. He was also criticized by them for having married a white woman. Machado was caught by surprise with the monarchy overthrown on 15 November 1889. Machado had no sympathy towards republicanism, as he considered himself a liberal monarchist and venerated Pedro II, whom he perceived as \"a humble, honest, well-learned and patriotic man, who knew how to make of a throne a chair [for his simplicity], without diminishing its greatness and respect.\" When a commission went to the public office where he worked to remove the picture of the former emperor, the shy Machado defied them: \"The picture got in here by an order and it shall leave only by another order.\"\n\nThe birth of the Brazilian republic made Machado become more critical and an observer of the Brazilian society of his time. From then on, he wrote \"not only the greatest novels of his time, but the greatest of all time of Brazilian literature.\" Works such as \"Quincas Borba\" \"(Philosopher or Dog?)\" (1891), \"Dom Casmurro\" (1899), \"Esaú e Jacó\" (1904) and \"Memorial de Aires\" (1908), considered masterpieces, were successes with both critics and the public. In 1893 he published \"A Missa do Galo\" (\"Midnight Mass\"), considered his greatest short story.\n\nMachado de Assis, along with fellow monarchists such as Joaquim Nabuco, Manuel de Oliveira Lima, Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay, and other writers and intellectuals, founded the Brazilian Academy of Letters. He was its first president, from 1897 to 1908, when he died. For many years, he requested that the government grant a proper headquarters to the Academy, which he managed to obtain in 1905. In 1902 he was transferred to the accountancy's directing board of the Ministry of Industry.\n\nHis wife Carolina Novais died on 20 October 1904, after 35 years of a \"perfect married life\". Feeling depressed and lonely, Machado died at 3:20 am on 29 September 1908.\n\nMachado's style is unique, and several literary critics have tried to describe it since 1897. He is considered by many the greatest Brazilian writer of all time, and one of the world's greatest novelists and short story writers. His chronicles do not share the same status. His poems are often misunderstood for the use of crude terms, sometimes associated to the pessimist style of Augusto dos Anjos, another Brazilian writer.\nMachado de Assis was included on American literary critic Harold Bloom's list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature, alongside writers such as Dante, Shakespeare and Cervantes. Bloom considers him the greatest black writer in Western literature; this is based on United States's conceptions of race, which are not the same in Brazil, where he is considered mulato. \n\nHis works have been studied by critics in various countries of the world, such as Giuseppe Alpi (Italy), Lourdes Andreassi (Portugal), Albert Bagby Jr. (US), Abel Barros Baptista (Portugal), Hennio Morgan Birchal (Brazil), Edoardo Bizzarri (Italy), Jean-Michel Massa (France), Helen Caldwell (US), John Gledson (England), Adrien Delpech (France), Albert Dessau (Germany), Paul B. Dixon (US), Keith Ellis (US), Edith Fowke (Canada), Anatole France (France), Richard Graham (US), Pierre Hourcade (France), David Jackson (US), G. Reginald Daniel (US), Linda Murphy Kelley (US), John C. Kinnear, Alfred Mac Adam (US), Victor Orban (France), Daphne Patai (US), Houwens Post (Italy), Samuel Putnam (US), John Hyde Schmitt, Tony Tanner (England), Jack E. Tomlins (US), Carmelo Virgillo (US), Dieter Woll (Germany) and Susan Sontag (US).\n\nCritics are divided as to the nature of Machado de Assis's writing. Some, such as Abel Barros Baptista, classify Machado as a staunch anti-realist, and argue that his writing attacks Realism, aiming to negate the possibility of representation or the existence of a meaningful objective reality. Realist critics such as John Gledson are more likely to regard Machado's work as a faithful description of Brazilian reality—but one executed with daring innovative technique. In light of Machado's own statements, Daniel argues that Machado's novels represent a growing sophistication and daring in maintaining a dialogue between the aesthetic subjectivism of Romanticism (and its offshoots) and the aesthetic objectivism of Realism-Naturalism. Accordingly, Machado's earlier novels have more in common with a hybrid mid-19th-century current often referred to as \"Romantic Realism.\" In addition, his later novels have more in common with another late 19th-century hybrid: literary Impressionism. Historians such as Sidney Chalhoub argue that Machado's prose constitutes an exposé of the social, political and economic dysfunction of late Imperial Brazil. Critics agree on how he used innovative techniques to reveal the contradictions of his society. Roberto Schwarz points out that Machado's innovations in prose narrative are used to expose the hypocrisies, contradictions, and dysfunction of 19th-century Brazil. Schwarz, argues that Machado inverts many narrative and intellectual conventions to reveal the pernicious ends to which they are used. Thus we see critics reinterpret Machado according to their own designs or their perception of how best to validate him for their own historical moment. Regardless, his incisive prose shines through, able to communicate with readers from different times and places, conveying his ironic and yet tender sense of what we, as human beings, are.\n\nMachado's literary style has inspired many Brazilian writers. His works have been adapted to television, theater and cinema. In 1975 the \"Comissão Machado de Assis\" (\"Machado de Assis Commission\"), organized by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture, organized and published critical editions of Machado's works, in 15 volumes. His main works have been translated into many languages. Great 20th-century writers such as Salman Rushdie, Cabrera Infante and Carlos Fuentes, as well as the American film director Woody Allen, have expressed their enthusiasm for his fiction. Despite the efforts and patronage of such well-known intellectuals as Susan Sontag, Harold Bloom, and Elizabeth Hardwick, Machado's books—the most famous of which are available in English in multiple translations—have never achieved large sales in the English-speaking world and he continues to be relatively unknown, even in comparison with other Latin American writers.\n\nIn his works, Machado appeals directly to the reader, breaking the so-called fourth wall.\n\n\nPosthumous \n\nTranslations\n\nCollected works\n\nThere are several published \"Complete Works\" of Machado de Assis:\n\n\nWorks in English translation\n\n\n\n\n"}

Also, elements of American and Australian slang have come through from imported television series.\n\nThe Malaysian Manglish is sometimes known as Rojak or Bahasa Rojak, but it differs from the Rojak language by the usage of English as the base language. The East Coast versions (Kelantan and Terengganu) of Manglish may differ greatly, as their accent of Malay and the jargon are particularly alien to regular Malaysian (West Coast) speakers.\n\nManglish in the West coast of West Malaysia is very similar (and sometimes identical) to Singlish.\n\nManglish shares substantial linguistic similarities with Singlish in Singapore, although distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary.\n\nInitially, \"Singlish\" and \"Manglish\" were essentially the same language, when both Singapore and the states now comprising Peninsular Malaysia were under various forms of direct and indirect British colonial rule, though not forming a single administrative unit except between 1963 and 1965. (See Malaya). In old British Malaya, English was the language of the British administration whilst Malay was the lingua franca of the street. Even ethnic Chinese would speak Malay when addressing other Chinese people who did not speak the same Chinese dialect.\n\nEnglish as spoken in Malaysia is based on British English and called Malaysian English. British spelling is generally followed. However, the influence of American English modes of expression and slang is strong, particularly among Malaysian youth.\n\nSince 1968, Malay has been the country's sole official language. While English is widely used, many Malay words have become part of common usage in informal English or Manglish. An example is suffixing sentences with \"lah\", as in, \"Don't be so worried-lah\", which is usually used to present a sentence as rather light-going and not so serious, the suffix has no specific meaning. However, Chinese dialects also make abundant use of the suffix \"lah\" and there is some disagreement as to which language it was originally borrowed from. There is also a strong influence from Malay, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, and Tamil, which are other major dialects and languages spoken in Malaysia. Manglish also uses some archaic British terms from the era of British colonisation (see \"gostan\" and \"outstation\" below).\n\nManglish is considered to be a less-educated form of Malaysian English used highly informally by the locals which has features of a pidgin or a creole. While all varieties of English used by Malaysian may be considered Malaysian English, some make a distinction between Malaysian English and Manglish; Malaysian English being a form of English that largely follows the standard rules of English grammar but with some local characteristics, while Manglish is a pidgin that does not follow the grammatical rules or structure of English. Many Malaysians however tend to refer to the colloquialisms used by thse taught in English-medium school as Malaysian English, while some argued for basilect form or the pidgin as as the \"real\" Malaysian English. At the lexical level, limited lexis is used and consequently, a number of words serve a variety of functions, giving extended meanings not normally accepted in standard British English.\n\nThere are some differences of contemporary words used between Malaysia and the United Kingdom. The use of Manglish is discouraged at schools, where only Malaysian Standard English is taught.\n\nThe term Malaysian English is not used in any official context except for the ever-changing school curriculum modules in attempts to improve the command of English but without going into advanced lessons. Call it English 112, English for Primary Students, Malaysian English, Conversational English etc. but \"Malaysian English\" is not an official dialect of English. \n\nIt is however, possible to speak Manglish without substituting English words with that from another language.\n\nSpeakers of Manglish from the country's different ethnic groups tend to intersperse varying amounts of expressions or interjections from their mother tongue – be it Malay, Chinese or one of the Indian languages – which, in some cases, qualifies as a form of code-switching.\n\nVerbs or adjectives from other languages often have English affixes, and conversely sentences may be constructed using English words in another language's syntax. People tend to translate phrases directly from their first languages into English, for instance, \"on the light\" instead of \"\"turn\" on the light\". Or sometimes, \"open the light\", translated directly from Chinese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ubiquitous word lah ( or ), used at the end of a sentence, can also be described as a particle that simultaneously asserts a position and entices solidarity.\n\nNote that 'lah' is often written after a space for clarity, but there is never a pause before it. This is because originally in Malay, 'lah' is appended to the end of the word and is not a separate word by itself.\n\nIn Malay, 'lah' is used to change a verb into a command or to soften its tone, particularly when usage of the verb may seem impolite. For example, \"to drink\" is \"minum\", but \"Here, drink!\" is \"minumlah\". Similarly, 'lah' is frequently used with imperatives in Singlish, such as the command, \"Drink lah!\" (Come on, drink!). 'Lah' also occurs frequently with \"Yah\" and \"No\" (hence \"Yah lah\" and \"No lah\"), resulting in a less brusque sound, thus facilitating the flow of conversation. This form is more used by Chinese in Malaysia.\n\nIt is also possible that Lah comes from Cantonese. In Cantonese, Lah is placed at the end of a sentence in imperatives making it sound more like a request than an order.\n\nIt might have Tamil origin as well. Lah is still used widely in Southern Tamil Nadu (Thirunelveli, Kanyakumari district) in the same manner. Tamil is said to be more pure in this region than northern Tamil Nadu and had ancient trade link with south east Asia.\n\nLah is often used with brusque, short, negative responses:\n\nLah is also used for reassurance:\n\nLah can also be used to emphasize items in a spoken list, appearing after each item in the list but is not commonly used in this context. \n\nAlthough lah can appear nearly anywhere, it cannot appear with a yes-no question. Another particle should be used instead. For example:\n\nThe Chinese influence in Manglish, however, can be seen among other races in Malaysia, especially when conversing with Chinese-speaking people. This principle can be generally applied to all forms of non-standard English spoken in Malaysia.\n\n'Loh' or 'lo' is used in the same context as \"lah\". It serves as a final particle to intensify a decision that is definitive and irrevocable.\n\nIn most cases, loh is used in direct response to a question or query with the connotation that the respondent is somewhat impatient or annoying because the person thinks that the answer is so obvious that the question should not have been raised from the start. In fact, the questioner might have no idea beforehand about the rude reply that would be shot back to him/her, though it can be argued that the word 'lah' might deliver stronger emotions from the speaker.\n\nFor example, to show argumentative mood or making emphasis, one would say, \"You lo (it's your fault), if it's not for you we wouldn't be in trouble now!\" and possibly in response, the other would say, \"Eh, I never forced you to follow me here loh!\" Another example is \"traffic jam loh!\" when asked by a friend why he or she is late to an occasion. \n\nSometimes, loh is used to express insincerity while speaking, for instance when one says \"sorry loh\" or \"thank you loh\".\n\nHowever, in some cases, the use of loh is only intended to give an advice without any notion of impatience. Examples: \"I think he’s being unreasonable loh\" or \"if you ask you will know loh\".\n\nIn lesser cases, using \"loh\" can make some emphasis or convey a jovial atmosphere. For example, \"I came all the way for you loh\" and \"Nah, that one loh, that fat chubby one in a yellow shirt loh\". \n\n\"Loh\" is mostly used by the Chinese community in Malaysia, because of its Cantonese origin.\n\n\"Meh\" is also a common ubiquitous word that used at the end of a question. It is usually used with a sense of confidence in his or her own statement but the hint of doubt towards the other person. For example,\" I like her, can not meh?\" (meaning \"I like her. What's wrong with that?\").\n\n\"Meh\" is of Cantonese origin. In Cantonese or Hakka, \"meh\" is a final particle that transforms statements into questions that indicate doubt or surprise.\n\nThe particle what , also spelled wat/wot, is used to remind or contradict the listener, especially when strengthening another assertion that follows from the current one:\n\n\"There is\"/\"there are\" and \"has\"/\"have\" are both expressed using got, so that sentences can be translated in either way back into British / American English. This is equivalent to the Chinese 有 yǒu (to have):\n\nCan is used extensively as both a question particle and an answer particle. The negative is cannot:\n\nManglish and Singlish share a common history and some common characteristics. The difference between Manglish and Singlish can be subtle and sometimes difficult to be distinguish even among the locals. However, Manglish is markedly more influenced by the Malay language, with the majority population in Malaysia being the Ethnic Malays; while Singlish is more influenced by Hokkien dialect or Mandarin Chinese, with the majority population being the Ethnic Chinese. For example, \"kena\" (a Malay word, somewhat of a prefix added for the sake of turning an action verb into passive form) might be more often used in Manglish; while Singlish more frequently uses words like \"liao\" (meaning \"already\" in Hokkien), \"nia\" (meaning \"only\" in Hokkien). However, referring the aforementioned example, \"kena\" is also used in Singlish and \"liao\" in Mangish, only to a less extent. This shows the huge influences on these two languages on each other as well. There is virtually no difference between the two when heard from foreigner's ears.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "228026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=228026", "title": "Om", "text": "Om\n\nOm (, IAST: \"Oṃ\", Devanagari: ) is a sacred sound and a spiritual symbol in Hinduism, that signifies the essence of the ultimate reality, consciousness or Atman. It is a syllable that is chanted either independently or before a mantra in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.\n\nOm is part of the iconography found in ancient and medieval era manuscripts, temples, monasteries and spiritual retreats in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The symbol has a spiritual meaning in all Indian dharmas, but the meaning and connotations of \"Om\" vary between the diverse schools within and across the various traditions.\n\nIn Hinduism, Om is one of the most important spiritual symbols. It refers to Atman (soul, self within) and Brahman (ultimate reality, entirety of the universe, truth, divine, supreme spirit, cosmic principles, knowledge). The syllable is often found at the beginning and the end of chapters in the Vedas, the Upanishads, and other Hindu texts. It is a sacred spiritual incantation made before and during the recitation of spiritual texts, during puja and private prayers, in ceremonies of rites of passages (sanskara) such as weddings, and sometimes during meditative and spiritual activities such as Yoga.\n\nThe syllable \"Om\" is also referred to as onkara (ओङ्कार, '), omkara (ओंकार, '), and pranava (प्रणव, \"\").\n\nThe syllable \"Om\" is referred to as \"praṇava\". Other used terms are ' (literally, letter of the alphabet, imperishable, immutable) or ' (one letter of the alphabet), and \"\" (literally, beginning, female divine energy).\n\"Udgitha\", a word found in Sama Veda and \"bhasya\" (commentaries) based on it, is also used as a name of the syllable. The word has three phonemes: \"a-u-m\", though it is often described as trisyllabic despite this being either archaic or the result of translation.\n\nThe syllable \"Om\" is first mentioned in the Upanishads, the mystical texts associated with the Vedanta philosophy.\nIt has variously been associated with concepts of \"cosmic sound\" or \"mystical syllable\" or \"affirmation to something divine\", or as symbolism for abstract spiritual concepts in the Upanishads.\nIn the Aranyaka and the Brahmana layers of Vedic texts, the syllable is so widespread and linked to knowledge, that it stands for the \"whole of Veda\".\nThe etymological foundations of \"Om\" are repeatedly discussed in the oldest layers of the Vedantic texts (the early Upanishads). The Aitareya Brahmana of Rig Veda, in section 5.32, for example suggests that the three phonetic components of \"Om\" (pronounced \"AUM\") correspond to the three stages of cosmic creation, and when it is read or said, it celebrates the creative powers of the universe. The Brahmana layer of Vedic texts equate \"Om\" with \"Bhur-bhuvah-Svah\", the latter symbolizing \"the whole Veda\". They offer various shades of meaning to \"Om\", such as it being \"the universe beyond the sun\", or that which is \"mysterious and inexhaustible\", or \"the infinite language, the infinite knowledge\", or \"essence of breath, life, everything that exists\", or that \"with which one is liberated\". The Sama Veda, the poetical Veda, orthographically maps \"Om\" to the audible, the musical truths in its numerous variations (\"Oum\", \"Aum\", \"Ovā Ovā Ovā Um\", etc.) and then attempts to extract musical meters from it.\n\nThe syllable \"Om\" evolves to mean many abstract ideas in the earliest Upanishads. Max Müller and other scholars state that these philosophical texts recommend \"Om\" as a \"tool for meditation\", explain various meanings that the syllable may be in the mind of one meditating, ranging from \"artificial and senseless\" to \"highest concepts such as the cause of the Universe, essence of life, Brahman, Atman, and Self-knowledge\".\n\nPhonologically, the syllable ओम् represents , which is regularly monophthongised to in Sanskrit phonology. When occurring within spoken Sanskrit, the syllable is subject to the normal rules of sandhi in Sanskrit grammar, however with the additional peculiarity that after preceding \"a\" or \"ā\", the \"au\" of \"aum\" does not form vriddhi (\"au\") but guna (\"o\") per Pāṇini 6.1.95 (i.e. 'om').\nIt is sometimes also written ओ३म् (\"ō̄m\" ), notably by Arya Samaj, where ३ (i.e., the digit \"3\") is \"pluta\" (\"three times as long\"), indicating a length of three morae (that is, the time it takes to say three syllables) — an overlong nasalised close-mid back rounded vowel.\n\nThe \"Om\" symbol is a ligature in Devanagari, combining ओ (') and chandrabindu (ँ, '). In Unicode, the symbol is encoded at and at (\"generic symbol independent of Devanagari font\").\n\nThe \"Om\" or \"Aum\" symbol is found on ancient coins, in regional scripts. In Sri Lanka, Anuradhapura era coins (dated from the 1st to 4th centuries) are embossed with \"Aum\" along with other symbols.\nNagari or Devanagari representations are found epigraphically on medieval sculpture, such as the dancing Shiva (ca. 10th to 12th century); Joseph Campbell (1949) even argued that the dance posture itself can be taken to represent \"AUM\" as a symbol of the entirety of \"consciousness, universe\" and \"the message that God is within a person and without\".\n\nThe \"Om\" symbol, with epigraphical variations, is also found in many southeast Asian countries. For example, it is called \"Unalom\" or \"Aum\" in Thailand and has been a part of various flags and official emblems such as in the Thong Chom Klao of King Rama IV (r. 1851–1868).\nThe Cambodian official seal has similarly incorporated the \"Aum\" symbol.\nIn traditional Chinese characters, it is written as 唵 (pinyin – ǎn), and as 嗡 (pinyin – wēng) in simplified Chinese characters.\n\nThere have been proposals that the \"Om\" syllable may already have had written representations in Brahmi script, dating to before the Common Era. A proposal by Deb (1848) held that the \"swastika\" is \"a monogrammatic representation of the syllable Om, wherein two Brahmi /o/ characters () were superposed crosswise and the 'm' was represented by dot\". A commentary in \"Nature\" considers this theory questionable and unproven.\nRoy (2011) proposed that \"Om\" was represented using the Brahmi symbols for \"A\", \"U\" and \"M\" (𑀅 𑀉 𑀫), and that this may have influenced the unusual epigraphical features of the symbol for \"Om\".\n\"Om\" came to be used as a standard utterance at the beginning of mantras, chants or citations taken from the Vedas. For example, the Gayatri mantra, which consists of a verse from the Rigveda Samhita (RV 3.62.10), is prefixed not just by \"Om\" but by \"Om\" followed by the formula \" bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ\". Such recitations continue to be in use in Hinduism, with many major incantations and ceremonial functions beginning and ending with \"Om\".\nMaheshwarananda (2002) suggests that the Om reflects the cosmological beliefs in Hinduism, as the primordial sound associated with the creation of universe from nothing.\n\nThe syllable \"Om\" is described with various meanings in the Upanishads. Descriptions include \"the sacred sound, the Yes!, the Vedas, the \"Udgitha\" (song of the universe), the infinite, the all encompassing, the whole world, the truth, the ultimate reality, the finest essence, the cause of the Universe, the essence of life, the Brahman, the Atman, the vehicle of deepest knowledge, and Self-knowledge\".\n\nThe Chandogya Upanishad is one of the oldest Upanishads of Hinduism. It opens with the recommendation that \"let a man meditate on Om\". It calls the syllable Om as \"udgitha\" (उद्गीथ, song, chant), and asserts that the significance of the syllable is thus: the essence of all beings is earth, the essence of earth is water, the essence of water are the plants, the essence of plants is man, the essence of man is speech, the essence of speech is the Rig Veda, the essence of the Rig Veda is the Sama Veda, and the essence of Sama Veda is the \"udgitha\" (song, \"Om\").\n\n\"Rik\" (ऋच्, Ṛc) is speech, states the text, and \"Sāman\" (सामन्) is breath; they are pairs, and because they have love for each other, speech and breath find themselves together and mate to produce a song. The highest song is Om, asserts section 1.1 of Chandogya Upanishad. It is the symbol of awe, of reverence, of threefold knowledge because \"Adhvaryu\" invokes it, the \"Hotr\" recites it, and \"Udgatr\" sings it.\n\nThe second volume of the first chapter continues its discussion of syllable \"Om\", explaining its use as a struggle between \"Devas\" (gods) and \"Asuras\" (demons). Max Muller states that this struggle between gods and demons is considered allegorical by ancient Indian scholars, as good and evil inclinations within man, respectively. The legend in section 1.2 of Chandogya Upanishad states that gods took the \"Udgitha\" (song of \"Om\") unto themselves, thinking, \"with this \"song\" we shall overcome the demons\". The syllable \"Om\" is thus implied as that which inspires the good inclinations within each person.\n\nChandogya Upanishad's exposition of syllable \"Om\" in its opening chapter combines etymological speculations, symbolism, metric structure and philosophical themes. In the second chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad, the meaning and significance of \"Om\" evolves into a philosophical discourse, such as in section 2.10 where \"Om\" is linked to the Highest Self, and section 2.23 where the text asserts \"Om\" is the essence of three forms of knowledge, \"Om\" is Brahman and \"Om is all this [observed world]\".\n\nThe Katho Upanishad is the legendary story of a little boy, Nachiketa – the son of sage Vajasravasa – who meets Yama, the Indian deity of death. Their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of man, knowledge, Atman (Soul, Self) and moksha (liberation). In section 1.2, Katho Upanishad characterizes Knowledge/Wisdom as the pursuit of good, and Ignorance/Delusion as the pursuit of pleasant, that the essence of Veda is to make man liberated and free, look past what has happened and what has not happened, free from the past and the future, beyond good and evil, and one word for this essence is the word \"Om\".\n\nThe Maitrayaniya Upanishad in sixth \"Prapathakas\" (lesson) discusses the meaning and significance of \"Om\". The text asserts that \"Om\" represents Brahman-Atman. The three roots of the syllable, states the Maitri Upanishad, are \"A\" + \"U\" + \"M\". The sound is the body of Soul, and it repeatedly manifests in three: as gender-endowed body – feminine, masculine, neuter; as light-endowed body – Agni, Vayu and Aditya; as deity-endowed body – Brahma, Rudra and Vishnu; as mouth-endowed body – Garhapatya, Dakshinagni and Ahavaniya; as knowledge-endowed body – Rig, Saman and Yajur; as world-endowed body – Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ and Svaḥ; as time-endowed body – Past, Present and Future; as heat-endowed body – Breath, Fire and Sun; as growth-endowed body – Food, Water and Moon; as thought-endowed body – intellect, mind and psyche. Brahman exists in two forms – the material form, and the immaterial formless. The material form is changing, unreal. The immaterial formless isn't changing, real. The immortal formless is truth, the truth is the Brahman, the Brahman is the light, the light is the Sun which is the syllable \"Om\" as the Self.\n\nThe world is Om, its light is Sun, and the Sun is also the light of the syllable \"Om\", asserts the Upanishad. Meditating on Om, is acknowledging and meditating on the Brahman-Atman (Soul, Self).\n\nThe Mundaka Upanishad in the second \"Mundakam\" (part), suggests the means to knowing the Self and the Brahman to be meditation, self-reflection and introspection, that can be aided by the symbol \"Om\".\n\nAdi Shankara, in his review of the Mundaka Upanishad, states \"Om\" as a symbolism for Atman (soul, self).\n\nThe Mandukya Upanishad opens by declaring, \"Om!, this syllable is this whole world\". Thereafter it presents various explanations and theories on what it means and signifies. This discussion is built on a structure of \"four fourths\" or \"fourfold\", derived from \"A\" + \"U\" + \"M\" + \"silence\" (or without an element).\n\nThe Shvetashvatara Upanishad, in verses 1.14 to 1.16, suggests meditating with the help of syllable \"Om\", where one's perishable body is like one fuel-stick and the syllable \"Om\" is the second fuel-stick, which with discipline and diligent rubbing of the sticks unleashes the concealed fire of thought and awareness within. Such knowledge, asserts the Upanishad, is the goal of Upanishads. The text asserts that \"Om\" is a tool of meditation empowering one to know the God within oneself, to realize one's Atman (Soul, Self).\n\nAitareya Aranyaka in verse 23.6, explains \"Om\" as \"an acknowledgment, melodic confirmation, something that gives momentum and energy to a hymn\".\nThe Bhagavad Gita, in the Epic Mahabharata, mentions the meaning and significance of \"Om\" in several verses. For example, Fowler notes that verse 9.17 of the Bhagavad Gita synthesizes the competing dualistic and monist streams of thought in Hinduism, by using \"\"Om\" which is the symbol for the indescribable, impersonal Brahman\".\nThe significance of the sacred syllable in the Hindu traditions, is similarly highlighted in various of its verses, such as verse 17.24 where the importance of \"Om\" during prayers, charity and meditative practices is explained as follows,\nThe aphoristic verse 1.27 of Pantanjali's Yogasutra links \"Om\" to Yoga practice, as follows,\n\nJohnston states this verse highlights the importance of \"Om\" in the meditative practice of Yoga, where it symbolizes three worlds in the Soul; the three times – past, present and future eternity, the three divine powers – creation, preservation and transformation in one Being; and three essences in one Spirit – immortality, omniscience and joy. It is, asserts Johnston, a symbol for the perfected Spiritual Man (his emphasis).\n\nThe medieval era texts of Hinduism, such as the Puranas adopt and expand the concept of \"Om\" in their own ways, and to their own theistic sects. According to the Vayu Purana, \"Om\" is the representation of the Hindu Trimurti, and represents the union of the three gods, viz. \"A\" for Brahma, \"U\" for Vishnu and \"M\" for Shiva. The three sounds also symbolise the three Vedas, namely (Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda).\n\nThe Shiva Purana highlights the relation between deity Shiva and the \"Pranava\" or \"Om\". Shiva is declared to be \"Om\", and that \"Om\" is Shiva.\n\nIn Jainism, om is considered a condensed form of reference to the Pañca-Parameṣṭhi, by their initials \"A+A+A+U+M\" (\"\"). The Dravyasamgraha quotes a Prakrit line:\n\n\"Om\" is often used in some later schools of Buddhism, for example Tibetan Buddhism, which was influenced by Indian Hinduism and Tantra.\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism, \"Om\" is often transliterated as the Chinese character (pinyin ') or (pinyin ').\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, \"Om\" is often placed at the beginning of mantras and dharanis. Probably the most well known mantra is \"Om mani padme hum\", the six syllable mantra of the Bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokiteśvara. This mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteśvara. Moreover, as a seed syllable (\"bija mantra\"), \"Aum\" is considered sacred and holy in Esoteric Buddhism.\n\nSome scholars interpret the first word of the mantra \"oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ\" to be \"auṃ\", with a meaning similar to Hinduism – the totality of sound, existence and consciousness.\n\n\"Oṃ\" has been described by the 14th Dalai Lama as \"composed of three pure letters, A, U, and M. These symbolize the impure body, speech, and mind of everyday unenlightened life of a practitioner; they also symbolize the pure exalted body, speech and mind of an enlightened Buddha.\" According to Simpkins, Om is a part of many mantras in Tibetan Buddhism and is a symbolism for \"wholeness, perfection and the infinite\".\n\n\"Aum\" is symbolically represented by Niō (仁王) statues in Japan, and their equivalent in East Asia. \"Niō\" appear in pairs in front of Buddhist temple gates and stupas, in the form of two fierce looking guardian kings (\"Vajra\"). One has an open mouth, regarded by Buddhists as symbolically speaking the \"A\" syllable; the other has a closed mouth, symbolically speaking the \"Um\" syllable. The two together are regarded as saying \"Aum\", the \"vajra-breath\", or the Absolute in Sanskrit.\n\nKomainu (狛犬), also called lion-dogs, found in Japan, Korea and China, also occur in pairs before Buddhist temples and public spaces, and again, one has an open mouth (\"Agyō\"), the other closed (\"Ungyō\"). Like \"Nio\" statues, they are traditionally interpreted to be saying the start and end of \"Aun\" – a transliteration of the Sanskrit sacred syllable \"Aum\" (or \"Om\"), signifying the start and end of everything.\n\n\"Ik Oankar\", iconically represented as in Sikhism are the opening words of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh scripture. It is the statement that 'there is one God', and that there is 'singularity despite seeming plurality'. The \"Oankar\" of Sikhism is related to \"Om\" in Hinduism, states the Indologist Wendy Doniger. Some Sikhs disagree that \"Ik Oankar\" is same as \"Om\". The phrase is a compound of the numeral one (\"ik\") and \"onkar\", states Doniger, canonically understood in Sikhism to refer to \"absolute monotheistic unity of God\".\n\nOnkar is, states Wazir Singh, a \"variation of Om (Aum) of the ancient Indian scriptures (with a slight change in its orthography), implying the seed-force that evolves as the universe\". \"Ik Onkar\" is part of the \"Mul Mantra\" in Sikh teachings and represents \"One God\", explains Gulati, where \"Ik\" means One, and Onkar is \"equivalent of the Hindu \"Om\" (Aum)\". Guru Nanak wrote a poem entitled Oankar in which, states Doniger, he \"attributed the origin and sense of speech to the Divinity, who is thus the Om-maker\".\n\"Ik Aumkara\" appears at the start of \"Mul Mantra\", states Kohli, and it occurs as \"Aum\" in the \"Upanishads\" and in \"Gurbani\". However, the meaning of \"Oankar\" in the Sikh tradition, states Pashaura Singh, is quite different in certain respects than those in other Indian philosophical traditions.\n\nThe Brahmic script \"om\"-ligature has become widely recognised in Western counterculture since the 1960s, mostly in its standard Devanagari form (ॐ), but the Tibetan alphabet \"om\" (ༀ) has also gained limited currency in popular culture.\n\n"}

A dancer is said to be \"en pointe\" when the dancer's body is supported in this manner, and a fully extended vertical foot is said to be \"en pointe\" when touching the floor, even when not bearing weight. Pointe work is performed while wearing pointe shoes, which employ structural reinforcing to distribute the dancer's weight load throughout the foot, thus reducing the load on the toes enough to enable the dancer to support all body weight on fully vertical feet.\n\nPointe technique resulted from a desire for female dancers to appear weightless and sylph-like. Although both men and women are capable of pointe work, it is most often performed by women. Extensive training and practice are required to develop the strength and technique needed for pointe work. Typically, dance teachers consider factors such as age, experience, strength, and alignment when deciding whether to allow a dancer to begin pointe work.\n\nPointe technique encompasses both the mechanical and artistic aspects of pointe work. In particular, it is concerned with body alignment, placement of the feet, and the manner in which a dancer transitions to and from en pointe. A dancer is said to have \"good\" or \"proper\" technique when in conformance with the best practices of pointe technique, which in turn are generally referred to as \"proper technique\".\n\nEn pointe dancers employ pointe technique to determine foot placement and body alignment. When exhibiting proper technique, a dancer's en pointe foot is placed so that the instep is fully stretched, with toes perpendicular to the floor, with the pointe shoe's platform (the flattened tip of the toe box) square to the floor so that a substantial part of its surface is contacting the floor.\n\nProper technique is also evident from a dancer's body alignment, by visualizing a straight line that extends from the center of the hip through the toes. When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and big toe joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and the joints of the second toe or middle toe or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.\n\nA dancer may transition to en pointe by any of three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué. In the relevé method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the toe box remains in contact with the floor, thus \"rolling up\" on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with feet flat on the floor or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the sauté method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To transition to en pointe via piqué, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.\n\nModern ballet technique incorporates all three transition methods. Relevé and piqué transitions are typically used for adages, where strength, poise, and controlled movements are highlighted. The more abrupt sauté method, which was introduced by Enrico Cecchetti, is typically used in allegros, where the relatively slow and smooth relevé and piqué transitions would be both impractical and visually inconsistent with the lively pace of movement. The sauté method is more common in Russian ballet.\n\nAlthough age is not necessarily a prerequisite, many ballet students do not begin to dance en pointe earlier than approximately 12–14 years of age because bones in the feet are often too soft prior to that age and, in such cases, serious and permanent foot injuries could result from starting pointe work too early. The long bones in feet begin to harden within the ages of 8 to 14, dancing en pointe before one's bones have hardened can lead to trauma and growth-plate fractures that create deformed feet.\n\nExceptions may be made if a physician has determined that a dancer's feet have sufficiently ossified, and it is not uncommon for dancers to begin pointe work as early as age nine. Oftentimes dance studios require their dancers to get x-rays performed on their feet and have their physician verify whether the dancer's feet are ready for pointe work.\n\nAnother key determining factor is strength in the legs, feet, ankles, and core. Without strong ankles, feet, and legs dancers are likely to hurt themselves once en pointe or be too weak to remain en pointe for the duration of a routine. Strong core strength ensures the dancer maintains their center and prevents them from rolling their feet when dancing en pointe.\n\nOtherwise, ballet students are generally ready to begin pointe work after achieving competency in fundamental ballet technique and have been dancing for a number of years. For example, before learning pointe work, a dancer must be able to maintain turnout while performing center combinations, hold a proper ballet position with straight back and good turnout, pull up properly in the legs, and balance securely in a relevé that is perpendicular to the floor.\n\nPreparation for pointe work is a gradual process that begins with barre exercises to develop the requisite strength in ankles, feet, legs, and core often known as pre-pointe classes. These exercises may vary in accordance with a teacher's preferences and, if applicable, the training method's syllabus. The first exercises at the barre are usually \"relevés\" and \"échappés\". When the student is comfortable executing these steps on both feet and sufficiently strong, steps ending on one en pointe foot are introduced, such as \"pas de bourrée\" and \"retiré.\"\n\nDuring each class session, a student will move on to centre exercises after completing the barre work. These exercises emphasize various aspects of ballet technique, such as turnout, pointing of the toes, and the use of ballet technique while en pointe.\n\nDancers take pre-pointe typically for a year before they are allowed to get pointe shoes. However, it is to the discretion of the dance instructor to determine if one year of pre-pointe is sufficient or if the dancer needs more time to prepare.\n\nDancing en pointe stresses the feet in various ways and thus can potentially cause injuries if the dancer does not plan ahead or take into account health and safety concerns. Injuries can result from improper technique, poorly fitting pointe shoes, and lack of effective cushioning and accessories. Some types of injuries are prevented by adhering to proper technique such as correct upper-body positioning, maintaining straight knees when required, keeping body weight centered over the box of the shoes, and avoiding sickling. Problems dealing with technique can be easily fixed by proper training and one-on-one interactions with the dance instructor to improve the dancer's technique.\n\nInjuries due to toe misalignment are often avoided by adjusting toe alignments with gel toe spacers. Toenail bruising can be caused by heavy pressure on the surface of the nail; this is typically prevented by keeping toenails clipped short, by wrapping tape around the toes, by using padding, or combinations of these. Bruising can also occur on the tips of the toes, especially when no padding is used. It is highly unadvised to dance en pointe without any padding at all.\n\nPointe work can cause friction between toes and the interior of the pointe shoe's box. This friction, under the high pressure of much of the dancer's body weight, can result in chafing and blistering. This is often mitigated with lambswool or toe pads or by wrapping tape around toes or use gel pads that can conform to any one problem area. Choosing between cloth and gel, gel, only cloth, wool, etc. for toe pads is a personal preference for each dancer but each style has its own benefits.\n\nOther exterior injuries include cuts caused by toenails piercing adjacent toes. This can be prevented by keeping toe nails cut short and filed smooth. Also, calluses may form on the bottoms and sides of the feet, which can crack open. This can be helped by the use of gel pad protectors on specific problem spots or using pads to surround the toes. Ingrown nails can result from ill-fitting shoes.\n\nOther common injuries:\n"}

To assess the degree of association between two given words, it uses pointwise mutual information (PMI) to sort lists of important neighbor words of the two target words from a large corpus. \n\nThe PMI-IR method used AltaVista's Advanced Search query syntax to calculate probabilities. Note that the \"NEAR\" search operator of AltaVista is an essential operator in the PMI-IR method. However, it is no longer in use in AltaVista; this means that, from the implementation point of view, it is not possible to use the PMI-IR method in the same form in new systems. In any case, from the algorithmic point of view, the advantage of using SOC-PMI is that it can calculate the similarity between two words that do not co-occur frequently, because they co-occur with the same neighboring words. For example, the British National Corpus (BNC) has been used as a source of frequencies and contexts. \n\nThe method considers the words that are common in both lists and aggregate their PMI values (from the opposite list) to calculate the relative semantic similarity. We define the \"pointwise mutual information\" function for only those words having formula_1,\n\nwhere formula_3 tells us how many times the type formula_4 appeared in the entire corpus, formula_5 tells us how many times word formula_4 appeared with word formula_7 in a context window and formula_8 is total number of tokens in the corpus. Now, for word formula_7, we define a set of words, formula_10, sorted in descending order by their PMI values with formula_7 and taken the top-most formula_12 words having formula_13.\n\nThe set formula_10, contains words formula_15, \n\nA rule of thumb is used to choose the value of formula_12. The \"formula_12-PMI summation\" function of a word is defined with respect to another word. For word formula_21 with respect to word formula_22 it is:\n\nwhere formula_24 which sums all the positive PMI values of words in the set formula_25 also common to the words in the set formula_26. In other words, this function actually aggregates the positive PMI values of all the semantically close words of formula_22 which are also common in formula_21's list. formula_29 should have a value greater than 1. So, the \"formula_12-PMI summation\" function for word formula_21 with respect to word formula_22 having formula_33 and the \"formula_12-PMI summation\" function for word formula_22 with respect to word formula_21 having formula_37 are\n\nand\n\nrespectively.\n\nFinally, the \"semantic PMI similarity\" function between the two words, formula_21 and formula_22, is defined as\n\nThe semantic word similarity is normalized, so that it provides a similarity score between formula_43 and formula_44 inclusively. The normalization of semantic similarity algorithm returns a normalized score of similarity between two words. It takes as arguments the two words, formula_45 and formula_46, and a maximum value, formula_47, that is returned by the semantic similarity function, Sim(). It returns a similarity score between 0 and 1 inclusively. For example, the algorithm returns 0.986 for words \"cemetery\" and \"graveyard\" with formula_48 (for SOC-PMI method).\n\n"}

The song was published in 1956, sounding similar to piano trio in C minor 3rd movement by Josep Suk.\n\nThe song is a turning point in the plotline of the musical. Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering have been drilling Eliza Doolittle incessantly with speech exercises, trying to break her Cockney accent speech pattern. The key lyric in the song is \"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain\", which contains five words that a Cockney would pronounce with or – more like \"eye\" than the Received Pronunciation diphthong . With the three of them nearly exhausted, Eliza finally \"gets it\", and recites the sentence with all long-As. The trio breaks into song, repeating this key phrase as well as singing other exercises correctly, such as \"In Hertford, Hereford, and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly happen\", and \"How kind of you to let me come\", in which Eliza had failed before by dropping the leading 'H'.\n\nThe phrase does not appear in Shaw's original play, but is used in the 1938 film of the play. According to \"The Disciple and His Devil\", the biography of Gabriel Pascal by his wife Valerie, it was he who introduced the famous phonetic exercises \"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain\" and \"In Hertford, Hereford, and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen\" into the script of the film, the first of which was later used in the song in \"My Fair Lady\".\n\nRain in Spain does not actually stay mainly in the plain; it falls mainly in the Pyrenees.

The lyric about Hertford, Hereford, and Hampshire contains an implicature (but not an entailment) that hurricanes ever occur at all in these areas. This implicature is false as the only hurricane-force winds (≥ 64 knots) that do occur in these areas result from extratropical cyclones, which differ from hurricanes in their causes and dynamics.\n\nThe musical has been translated into many languages, with Eliza speaking Berlin, Vienna, Stockholm, Göteborg, Amsterdam, and Budapest dialects.

Clarke Award, James Tiptree, Jr. Award, Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis and the British Science Fiction Association Award. It was followed by a sequel, \"Children of God\", in 1998. The title refers to Gospel of Matthew 10:29–31, which relates that not even a sparrow falls to the earth without God's knowledge thereof.\n\nIn the year 2019, the SETI program at Arecibo Observatory discovers radio broadcasts of music from the vicinity of Alpha Centauri. The first expedition to Rakhat, the world that is sending the music, is organized by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), known for its missionary, linguistic and scientific activities since the time of its founder, Ignatius of Loyola. In the year 2060, only one of the crew, the Jesuit priest Emilio Sandoz, survives to return to Earth, and he is damaged physically and psychologically. The story is told with parallel plot lines, interspersing the journey of Sandoz and his friends to Rakhat with Sandoz's experiences upon his return to Earth.\n\nFather Sandoz, a talented Puerto Rican linguist, is described as of mixed Taíno and Conquistador heritage and character. Sandoz grew up in La Perla, a poor neighborhood, and joined the Jesuits as a teenager. After several stints at Jesuit missionaries around the world, he returns to Puerto Rico. Several of his close friends and co-workers, people with a variety of unique skills and talents, have seemingly coincidental connections to Arecibo. One of them, a gifted young technician, was the first to hear the transmissions; another, Sofia Mendes, a Turkish Jewish artificial intelligence specialist, has the connections and aptitude to obtain a spacecraft and help pilot the mission. Sandoz, who has often struggled with his faith, becomes convinced that only God's will could bring this group of people with the perfect combination of knowledge and experience together at the moment when the alien signal was detected. Sandoz and his friends, along with three other Jesuit priests, are chosen by the Society of Jesus to travel in secret to the planet, using an interstellar vessel made with a small asteroid.\n\nUpon reaching Rakhat, the crew tries to acclimatize themselves to the new world, experimenting with eating local flora and fauna, then making contact with a rural village, inhabited by a peaceful tribe of vegetarian gatherers, the \"Runa\". Though clearly not the singers of the radio broadcasts, the Earthlings settle among the Runa and begin to learn their language, known as \"Ruanja\", and culture. Although Sandoz struggles with his attraction to Sofia, he finds greater spiritual meaning in his interactions with the Runa. The crew transmits all their findings via computer uplink to the asteroid-ship in orbit. One day, in an attempt to retrieve supplies from their landing vehicle for a sick crew member, the landing vehicle runs short of the fuel needed to safely return to the asteroid ship, and the crew must face the reality that they may never return to Earth.\n\nWhen the Earthlings finally meet a member of the culture which produced the radio transmissions, he proves to be of an entirely different species from the rural natives, a \"Jana'ata\". This \"Jana'ata\", an ambitious merchant named Supaari VaGayjur, sees in the visitors a possibility to improve his status, while the crew hopes to find an alternative source of fuel in Supaari's city, Gayjur. Meanwhile, the crew begins to grow their own food, introducing the concept of agriculture to the villagers. These seemingly innocent actions and accompanying cultural misunderstandings precipitate an outbreak of violence. Though not closely related genetically, the \"Jana'ata\" have evolved by aggressive mimicry to physically resemble the \"Runa\", who are in fact their prey species. The human introduction of agriculture leads to a \"Runa\" baby boom which is harvested by the predatory \"Jana'ata\". The humans are riven with guilt over their misguided action, and most, including Sofia, are killed defending against the \"Jana'ata\" attack. Only Sandoz and one other human survive, and Sandoz endures capture, degradation, and a crisis of faith. Eventually found by Suupari, Sandoz's hands are disfigured and rendered useless in a \"Jana'ata\" practice meant to convey the honor and privilege of being dependent on another, a mutilation analogous to the practice of foot binding. The mutilation kills the other surviving crew member; Sandoz survives, though he is physically and spiritually traumatized and believes himself at fault for the death of his friends. Later, Supaari gives Sandoz away to the \"Reshtar\" of Galatna, the poet and musician behind the music originally heard on Earth, in exchange for the right to have a wife and start his own lineage. Held captive by the \"Reshtar\", Sandoz realizes the \"Reshtar\" is the sources of the music that brought them to Rakhat and momentarily regains his faith; however, the \"Reshtar\" is only interested in Sandoz as a pet and he is forced to sexually satisfy the musician, along with his friends and colleagues. It is later revealed that the \"Reshtar\" broadcasts songs about his sexual exploits, songs which may have been heard on Earth.\n\nWhen Sandoz returns to Earth in 2060, his friends are dead, and his faith, once considered worthy of canonization by his superiors, has turned into bitter anger with the God who inspired him to go to Rakhat. Due to relativistic space-time effects, decades had passed while he has been gone, during which popular outrage at the UN's initial and highly out-of-context report on the mission, and especially Sandoz's role in the tragedy, had left the Society of Jesus shattered and nearly extinct. The Jesuits shelter Sandoz from the media and help him recover physically, while the Father Superior selects a panel of Jesuit priests from around the world to help Sandoz come out of his shell and explain what really happened. Initially bent on discovering the truth, the other priests eventually recognize the great personal cost at which the journey came, and accept Sandoz's epic struggle with his faith. Over the course of several months, Sandoz painfully explains his story and begins his personal healing.\n\n\"The Sparrow\" is similar to James Blish's science fiction novel \"A Case of Conscience\". It also involves a Jesuit priest confronting an alien civilization. Mary Doria Russell has addressed this speculation:\n\nNancy Pearl, a reviewer at \"Library Journal\", felt that this book was mistakenly categorized as science fiction, and that it is really \"a philosophical novel about the nature of good and evil and what happens when a man tries to do the right thing, for the right reasons and ends up causing incalculable harm\".\n\nIn the Catholic journal \"Commonweal\", Paul Q. Kane writes that Russell has done her research on the early historic Jesuit missions and on Jesuit spirituality. He continues that she is successfully updating the stories of other important Jesuits who have sent men to distant lands or went themselves to foreign cultures to represent Christianity. \"Russell subtly raises concerns about the ways in which sophisticated cultures tell themselves cover stories in order to justify actions taken at a terrible cost to others\". This is also reflected in the way that Sofia has to buy her freedom from what she describes as an institution of intellectual prostitution; as well as the differences between the simple \"Runa\" who live in the countryside and the \"Jana'ata\", who are the sophisticated city dwellers that created the beautiful music which triggered the mission originally.\n\n\nIn March 2006 it was announced that Warner Bros. had purchased the rights to \"The Sparrow\" for Brad Pitt's production company, Plan B, and that Pitt himself would be playing the role of Sandoz with screenwriter Michael Seitzman adapting the novel to film.\n\nSince then, Mary Russell has revoked all film rights, believing that Hollywood cannot and will not make a film version of \"The Sparrow\" that is faithful to the book. She has written her own screenplay with her assistant Karen Hall, but has realized it has little to no chance of being produced.\n\nIn 2014, AMC announced it was developing a television adaptation of the book.\n\n\n\nThe following links are to detailed reviews with many plot details.\n"}

It is an official language of Papua New Guinea and the most widely used language in the country. However, in parts of Western, Gulf, Central, Oro Province and Milne Bay Provinces, the use of Tok Pisin has a shorter history, and is less universal, especially among older people. While it likely developed as a trade pidgin, Tok Pisin has become a distinct language in its own right. It is often referred to by Anglophones as \"New Guinea Pidgin\" or \"Pidgin English\".\n\nBetween five and six million people use Tok Pisin to some degree, although not all speak it well. Many now learn it as a first language, in particular the children of parents or grandparents who originally spoke different vernaculars (for example, a mother from Madang and a father from Rabaul). Urban families in particular, and those of police and defence force members, often communicate among themselves in Tok Pisin, either never gaining fluency in a vernacular (), or learning a vernacular as a second (or third) language, after Tok Pisin (and possibly English). Perhaps one million people now use Tok Pisin as a primary language. Tok Pisin is \"slowly crowding out\" other languages of Papua New Guinea.\n\n is derived from English \"talk\", but has a wider application, also meaning \"word\", \"speech\", or \"language\". derives from the English word \"pidgin\"; the latter, in turn, may originate in the word \"business\", which is descriptive of the typical development and use of pidgins as inter-ethnic trade languages.\n\nWhile Tok Pisin's name in the language is , it is also called New Guinea Pidgin in English. Papua New Guinean anglophones almost invariably refer to Tok Pisin as \"Pidgin\" when speaking English. However, professional linguists prefer to use the term \"Tok Pisin\", as this is considered a distinct language in its own right. The language can no longer be considered a pidgin strictly speaking: it is now a first language for numerous people, and is not simply a \"lingua franca\" to facilitate communication with speakers of other languages.\n\nThe Tok Pisin language is a result of Pacific Islanders intermixing, when people speaking numerous different languages were sent to work on plantations in Queensland and various islands (see South Sea Islander and Blackbirding). The labourers began to develop a pidgin, drawing vocabulary primarily from English, but also from German, Malay, Portuguese and their own Austronesian languages (perhaps especially Kuanua, that of the Tolai people of East New Britain).\n\nThis English-based pidgin evolved into Tok Pisin in German New Guinea (where the German-based creole Unserdeutsch was also spoken). It became a widely used lingua franca – and language of interaction between rulers and ruled, and among the ruled themselves who did not share a common vernacular. Tok Pisin and the closely related Bislama in Vanuatu and Pijin in the Solomon Islands, which developed in parallel, have traditionally been treated as varieties of a single Melanesian Pidgin English or \"Neo-Melanesian\" language. The flourishing of the mainly English-based Tok Pisin in German New Guinea (despite the language of the metropolitan power being German) is to be contrasted with Hiri Motu, the lingua franca of Papua, which was derived not from English but from Motu, the vernacular of the indigenous people of the Port Moresby area.\n\nAlong with English and Hiri Motu, Tok Pisin is one of the three official languages of Papua New Guinea. It is frequently the language of debate in the national parliament. Most government documents are produced in English, but public information campaigns are often partially or entirely in Tok Pisin. While English is the main language in the education system, some schools use Tok Pisin in the first three years of elementary education to promote early literacy.\n\nThere are considerable variations in vocabulary and grammar in various parts of Papua New Guinea, with distinct dialects in the New Guinea Highlands, the north coast of Papua New Guinea (Pidgin speakers from Finschhafen speak rather quickly and often have difficulty making themselves understood elsewhere) and the New Guinea Islands. The variant spoken on Bougainville and Buka is moderately distinct from that of New Ireland and East New Britain but is much closer to that than it is to the Pijin spoken in the rest of the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe Tok Pisin alphabet contains 22 letters, five of which are vowels, and four digraphs. The letters are (vowels in bold):\n\nThe four digraphs note diphthongs, as well as certain consonants:\n\nTok Pisin, like many pidgins and creoles, has a simpler phonology than the superstrate language. It has 17 consonants and 5 vowels. However, this varies with the local substrate languages and the level of education of the speaker. The following is the \"core\" phonemic inventory, common to virtually all varieties of Tok Pisin. More educated speakers, and/or those where the substrate language(s) have larger phoneme inventories, may have as many as 10 distinct vowels.\n\nNasal plus plosive offsets lose the plosive element in Tok Pisin e.g. English \"hand\" becomes Tok Pisin . Furthermore, voiced plosives become voiceless at the ends of words, so that English \"pig\" is rendered as in Tok Pisin.\n\n\nTok Pisin has five vowels, similar to the vowels of Spanish, Japanese, and many other five-vowel languages:\nThe verb has a suffix, (from \"him\") to indicate transitivity (, look; , see). But some verbs, such as \"eat\", can be transitive without it. Tense is indicated by the separate words (future) (from \"by and by\") and (past) (from \"been\"). The present progressive tense is indicated by the word  – e.g. \"eating\" is (or this can be seen as having a \"food stop\").\n\nThe noun does not indicate number, though pronouns do.\n\nAdjectives usually take the suffix (now often pronounced , though more so for pronouns, and for adjectives; from \"fellow\") when modifying nouns; an exception is \"little\". It is also found on numerals and determiners:\n\nPronouns show person, number, and clusivity. The paradigm varies depending on the local languages; dual number is common, while the trial is less so. The largest Tok Pisin pronoun inventory is,\n\nReduplication is very common in Tok Pisin. Sometimes it is used as a method of derivation; sometimes words just have it. Some words are distinguished only by reduplication: \"ship\", \"sheep\".\n\nThere are only two proper prepositions: (from \"belong\"), which means \"of\" or \"for\", and (from \"along\"), which means everything else.\nTok Pisin: \"\". → English: \"We went to the black market\".\nTok Pisin: \"\" → English: \"your key\"\nTok Pisin: \"\". → English: \"They are from Gordon's\". (ibid. 640f).\nSome phrases are used as prepositions, such as \"long namel (bilong)\", \"in the middle of\".\n\nSeveral of these features derive from the common grammatical norms of Austronesian languages – although usually in a simplified form. Other features, such as word order, are however closer to English.\n\nSentences which have a 3rd person subject often put the word \"i\" just before the verb. This may or may not be written separate from the verb, occasionally written as a prefix. Although the word is thought to be derived from \"he\" or \"is\", it is not itself a pronoun or a verb but a grammatical marker used in particular constructions, e.g., \"\" is \"car forbidden here\", i.e., \"no parking\".\n\nPast tense: marked by \" (from English 'been'):\nTok Pisin: \".\nEnglish: \"And the prime minister spoke thus\". (Romaine 1991: 629)\n\nContinuative same tense is expressed through: verb + \"i stap\".\nTok Pisin: \"\".\nEnglish: \"He/She is sleeping\". (ibid.: 631)\n\nCompletive or perfective aspect expressed through the word \"pinis\" (from English: finish):\nTok Pisin: \"\".\nEnglish: \"He had got out of the boat\". (Mühlhäusler 1984: 462).\n\nTransitive words are expressed through \"-im\" (from English: him):\nTok Pisin: \"\"\nEnglish: \"Finish your story now!\". (ibid.: 640).\n\nFuture is expressed through the word \"bai\" (from English: by and by):\nTok Pisin: \"\"\nEnglish: \"They will go to their rooms now. (Mühlhäusler 1991: 642).\n\nTok Pisin is a language that developed out of regional dialects of the languages of the local inhabitants and English, brought into the country when English speakers arrived. There were four phases in the development of Tok Pisin that were laid out by Loreto Todd.\n\nTok Pisin is also known as a \"mixed\" language. This means that it consists of characteristics of different languages. Tok Pisin obtained most of its vocabulary from the English language, \"i.e.\", English is its lexifier. The origin of the syntax is a matter of debate. Hymes (Hymes 1971b: 5) claims that the syntax is from the substratum languages, \"i.e.\", the languages of the local peoples. (Hymes 1971b: 5). Derek Bickerton's analysis of creoles, on the other hand, claims that the syntax of creoles is imposed on the grammarless pidgin by its first native speakers: the children who grow up exposed to only a pidgin rather than a more developed language such as one of the local languages or English. In this analysis, the original syntax of creoles is in some sense the default grammar humans are born with.\n\nPidgins are less elaborated than non-Pidgin languages. Their typical characteristics found in Tok Pisin are:\n\n\nMany words in the Tok Pisin language are derived from English (with Australian influences), indigenous Melanesian languages and German (part of the country was under German rule until 1914).\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is currently one of the most widely used methods of machine translation. In contrast to the simpler direct model of MT, transfer MT breaks translation into three steps: analysis of the source language text to determine its grammatical structure, transfer of the resulting structure to a structure suitable for generating text in the target language, and finally generation of this text. Transfer-based MT systems are thus capable of using knowledge of the source and target languages.\n\nBoth transfer-based and interlingua-based machine translation have the same idea: to make a translation it is necessary to have an intermediate representation that captures the \"meaning\" of the original sentence in order to generate the correct translation. In interlingua-based MT this intermediate representation must be independent of the languages in question, whereas in transfer-based MT, it has some dependence on the language pair involved.\n\nThe way in which transfer-based machine translation systems work varies substantially, but in general they follow the same pattern: they apply sets of linguistic rules which are defined as correspondences between the structure of the source language and that of the target language. The first stage involves analysing the input text for morphology and syntax (and sometimes semantics) to create an internal representation. The translation is generated from this representation using both bilingual dictionaries and grammatical rules.\n\nIt is possible with this translation strategy to obtain fairly high quality translations, with accuracy in the region of 90% (although this is highly dependent on the language pair in question, for example the distance between the two).\n\nIn a rule-based machine translation system the original text is first analysed morphologically and syntactically in order to obtain a syntactic representation. This representation can then be refined to a more abstract level putting emphasis on the parts relevant for translation and ignoring other types of information. The transfer process then converts this final representation (still in the original language) to a representation of the same level of abstraction in the target language. These two representations are referred to as \"intermediate\" representations. From the target language representation, the stages are then applied in reverse.\n\nVarious methods of analysis and transformation can be used before obtaining the final result. Along with these statistical approaches may be augmented generating hybrid systems. The methods which are chosen and the emphasis depends largely on the design of the system, however, most systems include at least the following stages:\n\n\nOne of the main features of transfer-based machine translation systems is a phase that \"transfers\" an intermediate representation of the text in the original language to an intermediate representation of text in the target language. This can work at one of two levels of linguistic analysis, or somewhere in between. The levels are:\n\n\n"}

The Southern Tsouic languages of Kanakanabu and Saaroa have the smallest phonemic inventories out of all the Formosan languages, with each language having only 13 consonants and 4 vowels (Blust 2009:165). These two languages are highly endangered, as many Southern Tsouic speakers are shifting to Bunun and Mandarin Chinese.\n\nThe Proto-Tsouic language was reconstructed by Japanese linguist Shigeru Tsichida in 1976, and is supported by Blust (1999) and Li (2008). However, Chang (2006) and Ross (2009) deny that Tsouic is a valid group; Ross places Southern Tsouic within \"Nuclear Austronesian\" (the family of the various proto-Austronesian reconstructions), but the Tsou language as a more divergent branch.\n\n\nThe following sound changes from Proto-Austronesian occurred in the Tsouic languages (Li 2008:215).\n\n"}
