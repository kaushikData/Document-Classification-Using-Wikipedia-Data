Although Ambelau island is only 20 km away from the much larger Buru island (population 135,000), the Ambelau language is rather different from all languages and dialects of Buru. The preservation of the language was also unaffected by the fact that Ambelau people compose only half of the Ambelau island population, and the communication with the Bugis and Javanese people composing the other half usually occurs in the official language of the country, Indonesian. Ambelau language has no dialects; so the Ambelau community on Buru island speaks identical language to that used on Ambelau. The language has no writing system.\n\nThe most detailed study of Ambelau language was conducted in the 1980s by Charles E. Grimes and Barbara Dix Grimes – Australian missionaries and ethnographers, active members of SIL International (they should not be confused with Joseph E. Grimes and Barbara F. Grimes, Charles' parents, also known Australian ethnographers).\n"}

While for some wines autolysis is undesirable, it is a vital component in shaping the flavors and mouth feel associated with premium Champagne production. The practice of leaving a wine to age on its lees (or \"sur lie\" aging) has a long history in winemaking dating back to Roman winemaking. The chemical process and details of autolysis were not originally understood scientifically, but the positive effects such as a creamy mouthfeel, breadlike and floral aromas, and reduced astringency were noticed early in the history of wine.\n\nAncient Roman writers, such as Marcus Porcius Cato, observed that wine that was left on its lees (or sediment as they knew it) exhibited different characteristics than wine that was quickly separated from its sediment. While the Romans did not understand the full chemical process or details behind the autolysis that took place, they were able to perceive the results of this autolysis in the creamy mouthfeel, reduced astringency and unique flavors and aromas that developed. With modern day understanding of autolysis, winemaking in the Champagne have strict regulation regarding the time Champagne must spend in contact with its lees in order to receive some benefit from autolysis. Under \"Appellation d'origine contrôlée\" (AOC) regulations, wines from Champagne cannot legally be sold until it has gone through autolysis in the bottle for at least 15 months with non-vintage Champagne. Vintage Champagne must have a minimum of 3 years aging; some Champagne houses extend the time for autolysis to 7 years or more.\n\nDuring fermentation, yeast cells convert the sugar in the grape must into ethanol. When the sugar food source for the yeast and necessary nutrients such as nitrogen run out, or the alcohol level of the wine reaches such a point to where it is toxic for the yeast, the cells die and sink to the bottom of the fermentation vessel. These dead cells, or \"lees\", are normally removed by racking the wine into a clean vessel. If the wine is left in contact with the lees, enzymes start to break the cells down producing mannoproteins (mannose-containing glycoproteins) and polysaccharides that are released into the wine. In sparkling wine production, a wine is made \"sparkling\" or \"bubbly\" because a secondary fermentation is introduced when the wine is contained within a sealed wine bottle. During this time the wine is deliberately kept in contact with its lees inside the bottle for a period ranging from a couple months to several years. Studies have shown that the chemical reaction of autolysis, and its impact on the wine, starts to become noticeable after 18 months and will continue to impart traits for at least 5 years. The sparkling wine is eventually separated from its lees through a technique known as riddling and disgorgement.\n\nThe effects of autolysis on wine contributes to a creamy mouthfeel that may make a wine seem to have a fuller body. The release of enzymes inhibits oxidation which improves some of the aging potential of the wine. The mannoproteins improve the overall stability of the proteins in the wine by reducing the amount of tartrates that are precipitated out. They may also bind with the tannins in the wine to reduce the perception of bitterness or astringency in the wine. The increased production of amino acids leads to the develop of several flavors associated with premium Champagne including aromas of biscuits or bread dough, nuttiness and acacia. As the wine ages further, more complex notes may develop from the effects of autolysis.\n\nIf not properly managed, wine faults can potentially develop from autolysis. If the layer of lees begins to exceed 4 inches (10 centimeters), the enzymes released from the process of the yeast digesting themselves creates reducing conditions and promotes the development of hydrogen sulfide and mercaptan odors. The process of stirring the lees or \"bâttonage\" can help prevent a thick layer of lees forming and promote a smoother autolysis. Poor hygiene of the winemaking equipment or wine made from grapes that had residue from fungicide can create off odors smelling of sulfide.\n\n\n"}

The commission was established in accordance with the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines. \n\nEstablished by Republic Act No. 7104 of 1991, the commission is a replacement for the Institute of Philippine Languages (IPL) that was set up in 1987 which was a replacement of the older Institute of National Language (INL), established in 1937 as the first government agency to foster the development of a Philippine national language.\n\nThe 1st National Assembly of the Philippines passed Commonwealth Act No. 184, s. 1936, establishing an Institute of National Language (\"Surian ng Wikang Pambansa\"). On January 12, 1937, Former President Manuel Luis Quezón y Molina appointed the members to compose the INL. By virtue of Executive Order No. 134 issued and signed by President Quezón on December 30, 1937, approved the adoption of Tagalog as the basis of the national language, and declared and proclaimed the national language based on Tagalog, as the national language of the Philippines. In 1938, the INL was dissolved and replaced with the National Language Institute. Its purpose was to prepare for the nationwide teaching of the Tagalog-based national language (\"Wikang Pambansa na batay sa Tagalog\") by creating a dictionary and a grammar book with a standardized orthography. In the School Year of 1940-41, the teaching of the national language (\"Wikang Pambansa\"), with its new standardized orthography, was set by law in the fourth year of all high schools in both public and private schools throughout the country. The Tagalog-based national language was taught in school only as one of the subject areas in 1940 but was not adapted as the medium of instruction.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Japanese occupiers encouraged the use of the national language rather than English in the schools. The Tagalog-based national language was, therefore, propagated not only in education but also in mass media and in official communication. The census for 1948 reported that 7,126,913 people or 37.11% of the population spoke the language, representing an increase of 11.7% from the 1939 figure of 4,068,565. Of these seven million people, 47.7% learnt it as a second language.\n\nThe current commission was established by Republic Act No. 7104 of 1991, replacing the Institute of Philippine Languages (IPL) that was previously set up in January 1987 (EO No. 117); itself, a replacement of the older Institute of National Language (INL), established in 1937.\n\nIn October 2018, the KWF announced in its newsletter \"Diyaryo Filiino\" (\"Filipino Newspaper\") its bringing online a National Dictionary in compliance with the commission's National Orthography of 2013: http://diksiyonaryo.ph/. According to the same October 2018 newsletter, also in the works (in experimental and pilot-testing stage) is an official spellcheck in accordance with the \"Ortograpiyang Pambansa\" (\"National Orthography\") and the \"Manwal sa Masinop na Pagsulat\" (\"Manual to Provident/Neat/Careful Writing\").\n\n\n\nOne major criticism of the commission is that it supposedly fails in its goal of further developing the Filipino language. This is grounded in the fact that Filipino is essentially Tagalog, a fact acknowledged by former Commissioner, Ricardo María Durán Nolasco, and with an impoverished technical and scientific vocabulary, at that, which relies heavily on foreign borrowings and, often, constructions. It is often left to the universities to develop their own respective terminologies for each field, leading to a lack of uniformity and general public disuse.\n\nIt is argued that current state of the Filipino language is contrary to the intention of Republic Act (RA) No. 7104 that requires that the national language be developed and enriched by the lexicon of the country's other languages. However, Resolution 92-1, which defines the national language as \"the language spoken in Metro Manila and other business centers of the country\", does not necessarily run counter to RA No. 7104.\n\n\n"}

He also studied at the Monastery of Mar Jacob at Kayshum. In 818, Dionysius was elected Patriarch of Antioch unanimously by a synod of forty-eight bishops. After his consecration, he issued a proclamation and held three councils in Raqqa in the same year, at which he issued twelve canons. Dionysius restored the Monastery of Qinnasrin in 822 after it was damaged by fire caused by dissenters.\n\nIn 826, Dionysius visited Egypt in the company of the Abbasid general Abdallah ibn Tahir al-Khurasani. He later held a council at the Monastery of Euspholis in 828, and returned to Egypt in 832 in the company of Caliph Al-Ma'mun. Whilst in Egypt, Dionysius met with Pope Jacob of Alexandria, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, a fellow miaphysite church, and several Coptic Orthodox bishops outside of the city of Tannis. He held another council at the city of Tagrit in 834, and met with Al-Ma'mun in Baghdad, and also his successor, Caliph Al-Mu'tasim. A total of one hundred bishops were ordained by Dionysius during his tenure and he served as patriarch until his death on 22 August 845.\n\nAt the request of John, Bishop of Dara, Dionysius composed the \"Annals\", a two volume history of the church and secular events from the coronation of the Roman Emperor Maurice in 583 to the death of the Roman Emperor Theophilus in 843. One volume was dedicated to church history whilst the other covered secular history, and each volume was divided into eight books. The work was composed with use of citations of the works of Theophilus of Edessa, an 8th-century scholar. The \"Annals\" were cited extensively by Michael I, Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch (r. 1166–1199), and the anonymous author of the \"Chronicle of 1234\". Dionysius' accounts were also later used in the \"Ecclesiastical History\" of Bar Hebraeus, Maphrian of the East (r. 1266–1286).\n\nThe \"Chronicle of Zuqnin\" was erroneously ascribed to Dionysius by Giuseppe Simone Assemani, but this has since been disregarded.\n\n"}
{"id": "6001783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6001783", "title": "Eastern Lombard grammar", "text": "Eastern Lombard grammar\n\nThe Eastern Lombard Grammar reflects the main features of Romance languages: the word order of Eastern Lombard is usually SVO, nouns are inflected in number, adjectives agree in number and gender with the nouns, verbs are conjugated in tenses, aspects and moods and agree with the subject in number and person. The case system is present only for the weak form of the pronoun.\n\nEastern Lombard has always been a spoken language and, in spite of sporadic attempts to fix the main features in a written grammar, a unique canonical variety has never prevailed over the others. The present day situation sees a large number of varieties, roughly identifiable by the area where a particular variety is spoken (so, you may encounter a Bergamasque, Brescian, a Camunic variety, etc.). Varieties differ mainly in phonology, syntax and word choice.<br>\nThis grammar is based on the Brescian variety and, although local differences (even remarkable) can be found, the basic principles are generally valid for the other varieties.\n\nNouns in Eastern Lombard have two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine.\n\nMasculine singular nouns generally end with a consonant:<br>\n• \"gat\", cat<br>\n• \"òm\", man<br>\nbut can often end with a stressed vowel: this usually happens where a historical \"-n\" has been dropped.<br>\n• \"cà\", dog<br>\n• \"pà\", bread<br>\n• \"carbù\", coal\n\nFeminine singular nouns generally end with \"-a\":<br>\n• \"gàta\", female cat<br>\n• \"fónna\", woman<br>\nbut can occasionally end with a consonant:<br>\n• \"néf\", snow<br>\nNote that, in some varieties, the final \"-a\" represents an sound, that can make feminine words sound like they end in *\"-o\".\n\nMasculine plural nouns follow particular rules depending on the ending of the singular form of the noun.<br>\nIf the singular ends with a stressed vowel, the word does not change in the plural:<br>\n• \"el cà\" → \"i cà\"<br>\nIf the singular ends with \"-c\", \"-j\", \"-m\", \"-p\", \"-r\" or \"-s\", the plural remains identical to the singular:<br>\n• \"el sac\" → \"i sac\"<br>\n• \"el ventàj\" → \"i ventàj\"<br>\n• \"el póm\" → \"i póm\"<br>\n• \"el cóp\" → \"i cóp\"<br>\n• \"el pér\" → \"i pér\"<br>\n• \"el ciós\" → \"i ciós\"<br>\nIf the singular ends with \"-t\", the plural will end with \"-cc\" (pronounced [tʃ]):<br>\n• \"el gat\" → \"i gacc\"<br>\nIf the singular ends with \"-n\", the plural will end with \"-gn\" (pronounced [ɲ]):<br>\n• \"el àzen\" → \"i àzegn\"<br>\nIf the singular ends with \"-l\", the plural will end with \"-j\":<br>\n• \"el caàl\" → \"i caàj\"\n\nFeminine plural nouns generally end with \"-e\":<br>\n• \"la gàta\" → \"le gàte\"<br>\n• \"la fónna\" → \"le fónne\"<br>\nWhen the singular ends with a consonant, the plural follows the rules applied to masculine nouns.\n\nAll the articles in Eastern Lombard agree in number and gender with the corresponding noun.\nArticles can be definite (like \"the\" in English) and indefinite (like \"a/an\"). Indefinite articles are used only with singular nouns, however to indicate an indefinite number of objects, Lombard exploits something similar to the partitive in French), but because the partitive system is much less developed in Lombard, this class of articles is included in the indefinite system.\n\nNote:\nBrescian: \" 'le fónne' \" <br>\nBergamasque \" 'i fómne' \" (eng. \"the women\")<br>\nNote that speakers that use one form may not find correct the other.\n\n\"El ga majàt l'armì del póm\" (\"He ate the seed of the apple\").\n\n\"A la fì vé 'l bel\" (\"The good part comes at the end\").\n\nBresciano:\n\nBergamasque:\n¹ - In some varieties of Eastern Lombard, \"en\" can be realized as and written as \"ön\" or even written as \"ö\".<br>\n² - The masculine article \"en\" becomes \"'n\" when it follows a vowel, as in:<br>\n• \"L'éra 'n gran rebelòt\", \"It was a big mess.\"<br>\n³ - The feminine article \"ena\" becomes\" 'na\" when it follows a vowel, and \"en' \"when it precedes one.<br>\n⁴ - From a historical point of view, \"dèi\" and \"dèle\" should not be considered the plural forms of \"en\" and \"'na\". However, practically, they behave as they are plural form of the indefinitive articles:<br>\n• \"Gó ést en cà\", \"I saw a dog.\"<br>\n• \"Gó ést dèi cà\", \"I saw some dogs.\"\n\nIn Eastern Lombard, adjectives with qualificative function usually go after the noun they modify, and agree with it in number (singular/plural) and gender (masculine/feminine).<br>\nPlural of adjectives is formed observing the same rules of nouns. So we have:<br>\n<br>\n\" 'n òm pesèn\" / \"du òm pesègn\" (a short man / two short men)<br>\n\" 'na fómna pesèna\" / \"dò fómne pesène\" (a short woman / two short women)\n\nAlthough, in general, if compared with the Italian tongue, Eastern Lombard is less permissive under this aspect, some common adjectives like \"bèl\" (beautiful), \"bröt\" (ugly), \"gran\" (big), \"bù\" (good, good-natured), \"brào\" (good, clever) can also be placed before the noun. In this case the meaning can take on a different nuance, e.g.:<br>\n<br>\n\"en bröt òm\" (a bad-natured man)<br>\n\"en òm bröt\" (an ugly man)\n\n<br>\nEastern Lombard expresses an extreme degree or absolute state of something by means of the absolute superlative, that corresponds to the English form \"very + adjective\".<br>\nDifferently from Italian, Spanish and other Romance languages, Eastern Lombard lacks a counterpart of the form \"adjective+issimo\" and also lacks a cognate for the Italian \"molto\". In the Brescian variety, the most widespread form is \"adjective + fés\", e.g.:<br>\n<br>\n\"l'è bèl fés\" (it is very beautiful)<br>\n\" 'na maöla dólsa fés\" (a very sweet strawberry)\n\nAlthough, the adverb \"fés\" cannot be used if the adjective is placed before the noun. In that case the superlative form is obtained by the adverb \"gran\" placed before the adjective, e.g.:<br>\n<br>\n\"du gran bèj caàj\" (two very beautiful horses)<br>\n\"l'è 'n gran brào barbér\" (he is a very good barber)\n\nAnother way to express a high degree of something is to reinforce it by means of a second \"adjective+ét/ènt\" (formerly a present participle), for example:<br>\n<br>\n\"só ché mis gosét\" (I am very wet; literally: dripping wet)<br>\n\"la padèla l'è calda sbrojéta\" (the pan is very hot; literally: burning hot)<br>\n<br>\nthe second element is very frequently a repetition of the first adjective, i.e.:<br>\n<br>\n\"'na máchina nöa nöènta\" (a very new car) <br>\n\"ghè za ciar ciarènt\" (it is already very clear)<br>\n\"del dutùr ghéra zó pjé pjenènt\" (it was very full of people down there to the doctor room)\n\nEastern Lombard makes a two-way distinction of demonstrative: the proximal form for the singular masculine is \"chèsto\", while the distal form is \"chèl\". This is the declension for the two forms:\n\n\nBoth the proximal and the distal form are frequently emphasized with \"chè\" and \"là\" after the noun. So for example:\n\n\"chèsto pà\" or \"chèsto pà chè\" or \"chèl pà chè\"(this bread);\n\n\"chèl pà\" or \"chèl pà là\" (that bread).\n\nPronouns are classified in personal pronouns (referring to entities), demonstrative pronouns (deitic function), interrogative pronouns (to formulate questions) and relative pronouns (linking sentence together).\n\nPersonal pronouns decline in number (singular and plural) and person (first, second and third). For the third person, gender (masculine and feminine) represents a further distinction.\nNotes:\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nExamples of use of the pronouns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrative pronouns are identical in form with the demonstrative adjectives (see corresponding table). Of course, they occur without a noun and they agree in number and gender with the referent. <br>\nDemonstrative pronouns are almost always used with the deictic particle \"ché\" or \"là\". However, while with demonstrative adjectives \"chèl\" can be used in combination with \"ché\", demonstrative pronouns do not accept the expression *\"chèl ché\". So:\n\n\"chèsto s·cèt ché\" (this boy) -> \"chèsto ché\" (this one)<br>\n\"chèl s·cèt là\" (that boy) -> \"chèl là\" (that one) <br>\n\"chèl s·cèt ché\" (this boy) -> no corresponding expression (*\"chèl ché\" is not an acceptable form).\n\nIn pronoun resolution (finding the referent of a pronoun), strong preference is given to animate entities rather to inanimate entities.\n\nOne of the first description of the verb declension of Eastern Lombard verbs is included in the small dictionary edited in 1951 by Stefano Pinelli\n\nAccording to the infinitive form, verbs are classified in two classes:<br>\n<br>\nThe first class includes the verbs ending in -à:<br>\n\"Parlà\" (to speak)<br>\n\"Cantà\" (to sing)<br>\n\"Nà\" (to go)<br>\n<br>\nThe second class includes the verbs with the infinitive ending in \"-ì\" or \"-er\". Note that almost all the verbs of this second class can present two infinitive forms, one ending in \"-ì\" and the other ending in \"-er\". For example:<br>\n<br>\n\"Lizì = Lèzer\" (to read)<br>\n\"Scriì = Scrìer\" (to write)<br>\n\"Patì = Patéser\" (to suffer)<br>\n<br>\nThe form in -ì is mandatory when an enclitic pronoun is added:<br>\n\"Gó de lizìl\" (I have to read it)<br>\nwhile the form in -er is generally preferred when the infinitive has no enclitic pronouns attached:<br>\n\"Gó de lèzer\" (I have to read)<br>\n<br>\nBergamasque instead alternates the form in -í with a form identical to the 3rd singular of present indicative mood.<br>\n<br>\n\"Gó de lès\" (I have to read) - compare with: \"Lü 'l lès el giornàl\" (he reads the newspaper) <br>\n<br>\ntherefore the two forms of the infinitive are:<br>\n\"Lezì = Lès\" (to read)<br>\n\"Scriì = Scrif\" (to write)<br>\n\"Corì = Cór\" (to run)\n\nPast participle is used in the compound tenses present perfect and past perfect.\nThe regular past participle is made adding an \"-t\" (or \"-da\" for feminine in adjective construction and tenses that require gender agreement) after the infinitive form. Verbs of the second class use the form ending in \"-ì\". For example:\n\n\"Parlà\" + \"t\" => \"Parlàt\"<br>\n\"Cantà\" + \"t\" => \"Cantàt\"<br>\n\"Scriì\" + \"t\" => \"Scriìt\"<br>\n\"Patì\" + \"t\" => \"Patìt\"\n\nThere are two present tenses in Eastern Lombard:<br>\nA simple present and a present progressive:\n\nThe Simple Present, is conjugated as follows:<br>\n<br>\nFirst class (infinitive in -à: \"cantà\" (to sing) )<br>\nI sing.: \"cànte\"<br>\nII sing.: \"càntet\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"cànta\"<br>\nI plur.: \"cantóm\"<br>\nII plur.: \"cantìf\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"cànta\"<br>\n<br>\nSecond class (infinitive in -ì/-er: \"córer\" (to run) )<br>\nI sing.: \"córe\"<br>\nII sing.: \"córet\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"cór\"<br>\nI plur.: \"coróm\"<br>\nII plur.: \"curìf\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"cór\"<br>\n<br>\nThe paradigms above are presented without the corresponding pronouns. II person singular and III personal singular and plural cannot be separated by their clitic pronoun. <br>\nThe following paradigm is presented with either the personal pronoun and the clitic pronoun:<br>\n<br>\n\"mé cànte\"<br>\n\"té ta càntet\"<br>\n\"lü el cànta\" (III person singular masculine)<br>\n\"lé la cànta\" (III person singular feminine)<br>\n\"nóter cantóm\"<br>\n\"vóter cantìf\"<br>\n\"lur i cànta\" (III person plural masculine)<br>\n\"lùre le cànta\" (III person plural feminine)<br>\n<br>\nThe first person plural can also be conjugated with the clitic pronoun \"en\" + III sing.<br>\n<br>\n\"nóter cantóm = nóter en cànta\"<br>\n<br>\nThis form can be prevalent or even exclusive in certain varieties (for example in Bergamasque).<br>\n<br>\nAnother local way to conjugate the I person plural is <br>\n<br>\n\"nóter càntem\"<br>\n<br>\nwhere the clitic pronoun seems to have shifted and merged with the declension.\n\nA feature which Lombard tongue shares (among Romance languages) with French is the interrogative conjugation of the verb. This form is much better preserved in Eastern Lombard than in Western Lombard, where superstratum effects by Italian are stronger. The analogy with French tongue holds at a syntactical level, i.e. \"interrogative form\" means a verb–subject order. A difference consists in the fact that subject particles are enclitic (no accent) and agglutinate with the verb. Internal Sandhi phenomena may take place as well \"canta-la?\" turns into \"càntela?\". \nSo, eastern Lombard verbs have a distinct conjugation paradigm for the interrogative function, where clitic pronouns shift after the verb and solder with it:<br>\n<br>\nFirst class<br>\nI sing.: \"càntej?\" that corresponds to \"(do I) sing?\"<br>\nII sing.: \"càntet?\" that corresponds to \"(do you) sing?\"<br>\nIII sing.masc.: \"càntel?\" that corresponds to \"(does he) sing?\"<br>\nIII sing.fem.: \"càntela?\" that corresponds to \"(does she) sing?\"<br>\nI plur.: \"cantómej\" that corresponds to \"(do we) sing?\"<br>\nII plur.: \"cantìf\" that corresponds to \"(do you) sing?\"<br>\nIII plur.masc.: \"càntej?\" that corresponds to \"(do they) sing?\"<br>\nIII plur.fem.: \"càntele?\" that corresponds to \"(do they) sing?\"\n\nIt is worthwhile noting that some Camunic dialects show a periphrastic interrogative form, with syntax similar to English tongue:\nNote that usual interrogative form is applied to the auxiliary verb \"fá\" in this context.\n\nThe negative form is obtained by adding the negation particle \"mìa\" after the verb:<br>\n<br>\nI sing.: \"cànte mìa\" that corresponds to \"(I) don't sing\"<br>\nII sing.: \"càntet mìa\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"cànta mìa\"<br>\nI plur.: \"cantóm mìa\"<br>\nII plur.: \"cantìf mìa\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"cànta mìa\"\n\nThe Present progressive, that is formed with the simple present of the verb \"véser\" + \"dré a\" + infinitive (literally \"to be behind to\", meaning \"to keep up with\"):<br>\n<br>\nFirst class (infinitive in -à: \"cantà\" (to sing) )<br>\nI sing.: \"só dré a cantà\"<br>\nII sing.: \"sét dré a cantà\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"(l')è dré a cantà\"<br>\nI plur.: \"sóm dré a cantà\"<br>\nII plur.: \"sìf dré a cantà\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"(i)è dré a cantà\"<br>\n<br>\nSecond class (infinitive in -ì/-er: \"córer\" (to run) )<br>\nI sing.: \"só dré a córer\"<br>\nII sing.: \"sét dré a córer\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"(l')è dré a córer\"<br>\nI plur.: \"sóm dré a córer\"<br>\nII plur.: \"sìf dré a córer\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"(i)è dré a córer\"\n\nThere are four past tenses. A simple past (imperfect) and three compound pasts (past progressive, present perfect and past perfect):\n\nThe Imperfect tense, which refers to any repeated, continuous, or habitual past action, is conjugated as follows:<br>\n<br>\nFirst class (infinitive in -à: \"cantà\" (to sing) )<br>\nI sing.: \"cantàe\"<br>\nII sing.: \"cantàet\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"cantàa\"<br>\nI plur.: \"cantàem\"<br>\nII plur.: \"cantàef\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"cantàa\"<br>\n<br>\nSecond class (infinitive in -ì/-er: \"córer\" (to run) )<br>\nI sing.: \"curìe\"<br>\nII sing.: \"curìet\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"curìa\"<br>\nI plur.: \"curìem\"<br>\nII plur.: \"curìef\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"curìa\"\n\nThe Past Progressive stresses the fact that the action was continuous in the past. This tense is formed with the imperfect of the verb \"véser\" (to be) + \"dré a\" + the infinitive:<br>\n<br>\nI sing.: \"sére dré a cantà\"<br>\nII sing.: \"séret dré a cantà\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"(l')éra dré a cantà\"<br>\nI plur.: \"sérem dré a cantà\"<br>\nII plur.: \"séref dré a cantà\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"(i)éra dré a cantà\"\n\nThe Present Perfect is used for every past action without strong connotation on the aspect of the verb, otherwise speakers prefer Imperfect or Past Progressive tenses. Notably, Lombard does not have a Preterite. <br>\n<br>\nThe Present Perfect is formed with the present of the verb \"ìga\" (to have) + the past participle or with the present of the verb \"véser\" + the past participle:<br>\n<br>\nExample from \"cantà\"(to sing), with auxiliary verb \"ìga\":\n<br>\nI sing.: \"gó cantàt\"<br>\nII sing.: \"ghét cantàt\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"ga cantàt\"<br>\nI plur.: \"góm cantàt\"<br>\nII plur.: \"ghif cantàt\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"ga cantàt\"<br>\n<br>\nExample from \"sta\" (to stay), with auxiliary verb \"véser\":\n\nI sing.: \"só stat\"<br>\nII sing.: \"sét stat\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"(l')è stat\"<br>\nI plur.: \"sóm stacc\"<br>\nII plur.: \"sìf stacc\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"(i)è stacc\"\n\nThe Past Perfect expresses that the action was completed in the past before some other event. <br> This tense is formed with the Imperfect of the verb \"ìga\" (to have) + the past participle or with the Imperfect of the verb \"véser\" + the past participle (similarly to the Present Perfect):<br>\n<br>\nI sing.: \"ghìe cantàt\"<br>\nII sing.: \"ghìet cantàt\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"ghìa cantàt\"<br>\nI plur.: \"ghìem cantàt\"<br>\nII plur.: \"ghìef cantàt\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"ghìa cantàt\"\n\nI sing.: \"sére stat\"<br>\nII sing.: \"séret stat\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"(l')éra stat\"<br>\nI plur.: \"sérem stacc\"<br>\nII plur.: \"séref stacc\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"(i)éra stacc\"\n\nThere are three future tenses. A simple future and two compound futures (future progressive and future perfect):\n\nThe Simple Future, is conjugated as follows:<br>\n<br>\nFirst class (infinitive in -à: \"cantà\" (to sing) )<br>\nI sing.: \"cantaró\"<br>\nII sing.: \"cantarét\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"cantarà\"<br>\nI plur.: \"cantaróm\"<br>\nII plur.: \"cantarìf\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"cantarà\"<br>\n<br>\nSecond class (infinitive in -ì/-er: \"córer\" (to run) )<br>\nI sing.: \"coraró\"<br>\nII sing.: \"corarét\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"corarà\"<br>\nI plur.: \"coraróm\"<br>\nII plur.: \"corarìf\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"corarà\"\n\nThe Future Progressive is formed with the simple future of the verb \"véser\" (to be) + \"dré a\" + the infinitive:<br>\n<br>\nI sing.: \"saró dré a cantà\"<br>\nII sing.: \"sarét dré a cantà\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"sarà dré a cantà\"<br>\nI plur.: \"saróm dré a cantà\"<br>\nII plur.: \"sarìf dré a cantà\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"sarà dré a cantà\"\n\nThe Future Perfect is formed with the simple future of the auxiliary verb \"ìga\" (to have) + the past participle or with the simple future of \"vèser\" + the past participle (similarly to the Present Perfect):<br>\n<br>\nI sing.: \"garó cantàt\"<br>\nII sing.: \"garét cantàt\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"garà cantàt\"<br>\nI plur.: \"garóm cantàt\"<br>\nII plur.: \"garif cantàt\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"garà cantàt\"<br>\n<br>\nI sing.: \"saró stat\"<br>\nII sing.: \"sarét stat\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"sarà stat\"<br>\nI plur.: \"saróm stacc\"<br>\nII plur.: \"sarìf stacc\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"sarà stacc\"\n\nSubjunctive and conditional moods are used to form the hypothetical sentences and to express desire.<br>\nThe paradigms for a regular verb (cantà = to sing) are the following:<br>\nperson\n\nsubjunctive present\n\nsubjunctive past\n\nconditional\n\nI sing.<br>II sing.<br>III sing.<br>I plur.<br>II plur.<br>III plur.\n\n\"càntes\"<br>\"càntes\"<br>\"cànte\"<br>\"cantómes\"<br>\"cantìghes\"<br>\"cànte\"\n\n\"cantèse\"<br>\"cantèset\"<br>\"cantès\"<br>\"cantèsem\"<br>\"cantèsef\"<br>\"cantès\"\n\n\"cantarèse\"<br>\"cantarèset\"<br>\"cantarès\"<br>\"cantarèsem\"<br>\"cantarèsef\"<br>\"cantarès\"\nImperative mood has only one tense (present) and three persons (II singular, I and II plural).<br>\nThe paradigm is the following:<br>\nperson\n\nI class verbs<br>\n\nII class verbs<br>\n\nII sing.<br>I plur.<br>II plur.\n\n\"cànta\"<br>\"cantóm\"<br>\"cantì\"\n\n\"scrìf\"<br>\"scrióm\"<br>\"scriì\"\n\n<br>\nImperative can also bring an enclitic pronoun to specify the object of the action or toward who it is directed. In this case the conjugation for the II singular person can be slightly different. So we have:<br>\n<br>\n\"cànta!\" (you sing!)\n\nbut\n\n\"càntela!\" (sing it!)<br>\nwhere \"-la\" is the enclitic pronoun indicating the object (in this example: III person singular feminine).\n\n\"càntega!\" (sing to them)<br>\nwhere \"-ga\" indicates toward who is directed the action (in this example: III person plural).\n\nand for the II class verbs:\n\n\"scrìf!\" (you write!)\n\nbut\n\n\"scrìel!\" (write it!)<br>\n\"scrìem!\" (write to me!)\n\nEastern Lombard makes a large use of phrasal verbs, i.e. a combination of a verb and an adverb of place. The meaning of the resulting form often significantly differs from the basic verb meaning. Here are some examples:<br>\n<br>\n\"catà\" (to pick up) <br>\n\"catà fò\" (to choose) <br>\n\"catà sö\" (to pick up, to drive over someone/something in a vehicle) <br>\n\"catà sa\" (to retrieve, to refer to unconcerning matters) <br>\n\"catà zó\" (to pick from a tree) <br>\n<br>\n\"tö\" (to buy, to take) <br>\n\"tö dré\" (to bring with oneself) <br>\n\"tö sö\" (to take up) <br>\n\"tö dét\" (to engage, to give an employment) <br>\n\"tö fò\" (to ask for rest days) <br>\n\"tö zó\" (to assume drugs or medical treatments) <br>\n<br>\n\"leà\" (to lift) <br>\n\"leà fò\" (to breed) <br>\n\"leà sö\" (to stand up) <br>\n<br>\nNote that the adverbial particle always comes immediately after the group \"verb + enclitic pronouns\", e.g.:<br>\n<br>\n\"te ghét de laàl zó\" (you have to wash it down)<br>\n\"càtemej sö, per pjazér\" (pick them up [for me], please)\n\nEastern Lombard has two auxiliary verbs: \"véser\" (to be) and \"ìga\" (to have) and are used in the same way as in Italian.\n\nBesides being used as copula or to express existence (like \"to be\"), Véser is also an auxiliary verb, contrary to the use of the English Present Perfect. <br>\nThe forms in the present tense are irregular:\n\nI sing.: \"só\"<br>\nII sing.: \"sét\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"(l')è\"<br>\nI plur.: \"sóm\"<br>\nII plur.: \"sìf\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"(i)è\"\n\nThe peculiarity of the verb \"ìga\" in Eastern Lombard is that it is always bound to a pronominal particle. The infinitive form, for example, is \"ìga\", where the particle \"-ga\" is a 1st person plural pronoun (comparable with the pronoun \"ci\" of the Italian).<br>\nWhen a different pronoun is needed, the particle \"-ga\" is replaced with the proper pronoun, for example:<br>\n<br>\n\"L'è bèl a ìga i sólcc\" (It is good to have money)<br>\nbut<br>\n\"La dis de ìl vést\" (She says to have seen it)<br> \n<br>\nThe same occurs in the conjugated forms, with the exception that the pronominal particle comes before the verb instead of after. For example:<br>\n<br>\n\"Gó du gacc\" (I have two cats)<br>\nbut<br>\n\"L'ó ést\" (I have seen it)<br>\n<br>\nThe complete conjugation for the indicative present is:\n\nI sing.: \"gó\"<br>\nII sing.: \"ghét\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"ga\"<br>\nI plur.: \"góm\"<br>\nII plur.: \"ghìf\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"ga\"\n\nCertain varieties (mostly Bergamasque) drop the pronominal particle when conjugated as auxiliary verb, thus, in that case, the correct expressions are:<br>\n<br>\n\"Gó öna moér e du s·cècc\" (I have a wife and two sons)<br>\nbut<br>\n\"Ó biìt tròp\" (I have drunk too much)\n\nCuriously enough, the imperfect conjugation of the auxiliary verbs seems to confuse and interchange the inflections.<br>\nEtymologically the two auxiliary verbs should be conjugated as follows:<br>\n<br>\nvéser:<br>\nI sing.: \"sére\"<br>\nII sing.: \"séret\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"(l')éra\"<br>\nI plur.: \"sérem\"<br>\nII plur.: \"séref\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"(i) éra\"<br>\n<br>\nìga:<br>\nI sing.: \"ghìe\"<br>\nII sing.: \"ghìet\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"ghìa\"<br>\nI plur.: \"ghìem\"<br>\nII plur.: \"ghìef\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"ghìa\"<br>\n<br>\nBut, beside these forms, the followings can often be found:<br>\n<br>\nvéser:<br>\nI sing.: \"sìe\"<br>\nII sing.: \"sìet\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"(l')ìa\"<br>\nI plur.: \"sìem\"<br>\nII plur.: \"sìef\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"(i) ìa\"<br>\n<br>\nìga:<br>\nI sing.: \"ghére\"<br>\nII sing.: \"ghéret\"<br>\nIII sing.: \"ghéra\"<br>\nI plur.: \"ghérem\"<br>\nII plur.: \"ghéref\"<br>\nIII plur.: \"(i) ghéra\"<br>\n<br>\nTherefore, the following sentences can be found with no apparent preference:<br>\n\"El ghìa fat sö 'na ca.\"<br>\n\"El ghéra fat sö 'na ca.\"<br>\nBoth meaning \"He had built a house.\"\n\nIn Eastern Lombard, negation is generally expressed with the form mìa (or locally mìga) after the verb.\n\n\"el tò s·cèt el stüdia mìa l'Inglés\" (Your son is not studying English).\n\nIn the case of a compound tense, the negation occurs after the auxiliary.\n\n\"só mìa nàt a scöla\" (I did not go to school).\n\nDifferently from Italian where the negative sentence pattern contemplates and requires the use of redundant negative particles, Eastern Lombard doesn't. Thus, when an indefinite pronoun with negative value is already present in the sentence, the particle \"mìa\" is usually dropped (even though in certain conditions it is tolerated).\n\n\"ghéra niènt de fa\" (there was nothing to do).<br>\nCompare with the Italian:<br>\n\" non c'era niente da fare.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"mé gó ést nüsü \" (I didn't see anybody).<br>\nIn Italian would be rendered with:<br>\n\" io non ho visto nessuno \". <br>\n<br>\n\"el ga mài lauràt\" (he has never worked).<br>\nItalian:<br>\n\" non ha mai lavorato\".<br> \n<br>\nThe forms:<br>\n\"ghéra mìa niènt de fa\" and \"mé gó mìa ést nüsü \" \nare tolerated while the form \"el ga mìa mài lauràt\" is not.\n\nA less common way to express negation is the use of the particle nó before the verb or before the proclitic subject pronoun. This form has almost everywhere been replaced by the use of \"mìa\". It seems to have crystallized uniquely in few expressions like:\n\n\"mé nó crède!\" (I don't think so!)\n\n\"gne nó 'l va, gne nó 'l vé.\" (neither it goes, nor comes it).\n\n\n\n"}

Dubbing is the act of re-recording of a live-action or animated production, typically in a language other than the original. Most productions are translated from different languages, but fandubs do exist for productions that were produced in the fandubber's native language. The dialogue can range from being a close translation to a completely altered version of the original script's story and plots, as well as the personalities of protagonists. The reasons behind fandubbing can range from the production not receiving an official dub to the official dub being poorly received. Fandubs are most commonly done with Japanese animation, but can include live action and animated series and movies in any language. Versions where the story line, character personalities, and content are dramatically altered, typically in a humorous manner, are called \"Abridged Series\" and \"fundubs\".\n\nBecause fandubs typically use copyrighted material, fandubs face the same copyright implications as fansubs but on a different scale. To avoid copyright issues, fandubs are sometimes made using web-based dubbing tools like Dubroo, which does not alter the original videos but just plays the dubbed audio along with the original muted video.\n\nAmateur voice acting began simultaneously and independently from each other in a small number of developed countries. One of the first recorded projects, dating from 1989, was the anime fan-dub parody \"Laputa II: The Sequel\", an English redub of the first four episodes of \"\".\n\nA further Star Wars fandub of Dominik Kuhn (Dodokay), using a scene in the film for a viral marketing parody gained fame with German mainstream media.\n\nWhile fansubbing is a highly-popular means by which various Internet-downloaded visual media can be understood by other language markets, fandubbing as a practice has not gained similar momentum as a means of translation by lay Internet users. The majority of fandub projects are arranged for short-form video clips and are often posted to video hosting services such as YouTube.\n\nMost series are produced online with voice actors often auditioning via forums, but live dubbing sessions at anime cons often take place, for example the \"Anime Dub Live\" panels held in the UK.\n\n"}
{"id": "6554792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6554792", "title": "Flash (manufacturing)", "text": "Flash (manufacturing)\n\nFlash, also known as flashing, is excess material attached to a molded, forged, or cast product, which must usually be removed. This is typically caused by leakage of the material between the two surfaces of a mold (beginning along the parting line) or between the base material and the mold (in the case of overmolding). Molding flash is seen when the optimized parameter on cull height is not calibrated. Proper design of mold parting surfaces can reduce or eliminate flash.\n\nMolding flash can be caused from old or worn mold cavities that no longer fit tightly together. Other times, the complexity of the part requires so many mating pieces with such precise geometries that it is almost impossible to create a perfect fit on every impression. Most often, the type of material being molded, and its attendant viscosity in its liquid form, is the primary factor that leads to the creation of the unwanted mold flash.\n\nThe process of removing flash, known as deflashing, is commonly performed via cutting, breaking, grinding, or tumbling. Some foundries use robot autogrinders to remove this unwanted material. It is very typical for molders to have their operators trim flash with hand tools at the molding machine between cycles. Many molders and OEMs seek out the use of batch processes including vibratory tumbling, cryogenic deflashing or media blasting to remove unwanted flash from large batches of parts.\n\nIn plastic injection, a faint mark called a witness mark (or witness line) will occur along the parting line. This is unavoidable and is usually accepted despite the minor aesthetics issue. However, some part surfaces (e.g. when used for sealing) cannot tolerate witness marks, and thus either the marks must be removed post-molding or the mold redesigned.\n\n"}

However, some dictionaries insist that the words must also sound different, while the Oxford English Dictionary says that the words should also be of \"different origin\". In this vein, \"The Oxford Guide to Practical Lexicography\" lists various types of homographs, including those in which the words are discriminated by being in a different \"word class\", such as \"hit\", the verb \"to strike\", and \"hit\" the noun \"a blow\".\n\nIf, when spoken, the meanings may be distinguished by different pronunciations, the words are also heteronyms. Words with the same writing \"and\" pronunciation (i.e. are both homographs and homophones) are considered homonyms. However, in a looser sense the term \"homonym\" may be applied to words with the same writing \"or\" pronunciation. Homograph disambiguation is critically important in speech synthesis, natural language processing and other fields. Identically written different senses of what is judged to be fundamentally the \"same\" word are called polysemes; for example, \"wood\" (substance) and \"wood\" (area covered with trees).\n\nExamples:\nwhere the two words are spelt identically but pronounced differently.

Examples of homographs in Middle Chinese are:\nMany homographs in Old Chinese and Middle Chinese also exist in modern Chinese varieties. Homographs which did not exist in Old Chinese or Middle Chinese often come into existence due to differences between literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters.

This kind of tournament organization made was a revolution in the Eastern Europe of the 80's, showing that socialists could create their own system of sport management.\n\nIn 1981, the Hungarian Federation of Basketball adopted his idea and organized the national championship following on his plan. The following year, the Ukrainian Pelota Basca tournament used Brodlowsky proposal, and so did the Bulgarians in their 1987 basketball competition.\n\nBrodlowsky system survived until the end of that decade, there are still some examples of its use around the world, such as: - Irish Rugby Union (1998/99); - South African National Badminton Championship (1991 to 1995); - Mexican Casting Party (1989 to 2003); - Texas Amateur Pickleball Prize, and many more.\n\n- Traditional (League) Organisation: competitors play against all the others (usually twice - home and away);\n\n- Number of finalists vary from 3 to 8, normally;\n\n- Key-bouts: These are chosen in order to promote competitors to the next stage.\n\nThe idea of 'key-bouts' is essential in this system. Brodlowsky says that teams have to qualify during the tournament, not after. Thus, it's important to determine the bouts in which competitors that occupy the first place in these moments will qualify themselves to the next stage.\n\nRegular Tournament\n\n\"National Hungarian Championship – Basketball (1981)\"\n\nNumber of competitors: 8\nFollowing stage: semi-final round\nKey-bouts: 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th.\nThis is the most classic example of this system, as we have four different qualified teams. After the second bout, Budapest Labda Club had two successes and occupied the first position. However, after the fourth bout, Basket Club TG was the first, and so this was another qualified.\nAfter the sixth bout, Basket Club TG lost its first position to Grand Voyage, which couldn't maintain it until the last bout, when Magyaro Club got it. So, we have four different qualified teams: Budapest Labda Club, Basket Club TG, Grand Voyage and Magyaro Club, which played normal semi-finals after that.\n\nException Tournament\n\n\"Mexican Casting Party – (2002)\"\n\nNumber of competitors: 32\nFollowing stage: quarter-final round\nKey-bouts: 1st, 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, 30th, 31st, 32nd.\nIn this example, we can see that it's not necessary to choose symmetrically the key-bouts – it depends on the goals of the tournament. In this case, managers chose the three last bouts to be key-bouts, giving special attention to the consistent competitors.\n\nThe tournament had 5 qualified competitors. However, and incongruency happened: Lucas Fernandez, with only 9 victories, was qualified after the first bout; Juan de Castro, with 17 victories, after the sixth bout; but Johnny Cudanrot, in the third position and with 28 victories, couldn't classify himself.\nAsked about what managers should do with this, Brodlowsky explained: “It's necessary to make an extra-match between Johnny Cudanrot and Lucas Fernandez. Why? Because Cudanrot has more winnings than half of the other qualified (actually, 3/5 of them). So, it's unfair not to give him an opportunity. In my opinion, as the creator of this system, an extra-game between Cudanrot and Fernandez is the best solution”.\nOf course, Brodlowsky was heard, the game was made and a surprise happened: Fernandez won that match and all the others, turning into the champion of that season!\n\nThis article is quoting many pages of the József Varga's Theory of Sport Management\n\n"}

His given name is unique since it includes the Kannada alphabet 'ಞ' (a palatal consonant pronounced nasally as \"nya\"), which is used very rarely in the written Kannada of today and is absent in the English alphabet which often leads to various other transliterations of his given name such as \"Kinyanna\" and \"Kinnanna\". Rai first learned Kannada in school. Later he published his first handwritten journal, \"Susheela\", at the age of 12. He was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and also participated in the freedom movement of India. During this period he married Unyakka and is a father to eight children.\n\nRai started his career as a secondary school teacher. He also delved into journalism and contributed his writings to newspapers like \"Swabhimana\", \"Madras Mail\" and \"The Hindu\". He received the National Award for Best Teacher in 1969. He is a writer and poet who has written books on theatre, grammar and children. Some of his famous poems are \"Shreemukha\", \"Aikyagana\", \"Punarnava\", \"Chethana\" and \"Koraga\". He has written a biography of Govinda Pai, the Kannada poet from whom he was highly influenced. His other important works are \"Malayala Sahitya Charithre\" (History of Malayalam literature),which is a translation of an original work by P. K. Parameshwaran Nair and \"Sahithya Drushti\". He was conferred an honorary doctorate by Mangalore University in 2005. He also chaired the 66th Akhila Kannada Sahitya Sammelana (Kannada Literature Conference), which was held at Mangalore. Some of his poems have been used as songs for the Kannada film, \"Paduvaaralli Pandavaru\" () which was directed by Puttanna Kanagal. In 1980 he also stood for elections in Kasargod to the Kerala Legislative Assembly but was unsuccessful.\n\nRai was also an avid agriculturist and was active in the cultivation of areca, rubber and rice.\n\nRai was a campaigner for the merger of Kasaragod district into Karnataka. One of his main goals was to seek the implementation of the Mahajan Committee Report, which urged the inclusion of the northern part of Kasaragod district (to the north of the Chandragiri river) into Karnataka. He founded the Kasargod Merger Action Council (\"Kasaragod Vileeneekarana Kriya Samithi\") in 2002 to work towards this goal. Describing the goals of this council Rai said that \"the linguistic minorities in the district were not against the Malayalis or Kerala State, per se, but were demanding the implementation of the Justice Mahajan Commission report, vis-a-vis the fulfilment of promises made by the former Chief Ministers, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, C. Achutha Menon and Pattam Thanu Pillai, in this regard.\" </ref>\n\nRai had a natural death from old age at his residence at Kallakalia near Badiyadka, Kasaragod, Kerala at the age of 100.\n\nSome of the awards and honours that Rai has received include:\n\n\n"}

Bein became at least as well known for his involvement with Esperanto as for his medical accomplishments, and as much for the manner in which he left the Esperanto movement as for what he had accomplished within it.\n\nAs a young man, Bein participated in the Polish movement for independence from Russia, for which he was exiled for several years; thus he was forced to finish his medical training in Kazan. Bein authored many technical books and articles, and founded the Warsaw Ophthalmic Institute and the Polish Ophthalmological Society. He was also a noted amateur photographer.\n\nBein was among the earliest adopters of Esperanto, the international language that had been created by a fellow Polish ophthalmologist, Ludwik Zamenhof. Bein became an eminent pioneer of Esperanto prose, writing under the pseudonym, \"Kabe,\" an abbreviation of his actual name (and also the Polish pronunciation of his initials, \"K.B.\"). In 1904 he gained fame with his translation of a 1900 novel by Wacław Sieroszewski, \"Dno nędzy\" (\"The Depths of Misery\"; Esperanto title: \"Fundo de l' Mizero\"). \n\nIn 1906 Bein became vice-president of the Academy of Esperanto. He had a profound influence on the language's early development. The highlights of his career were most likely his Esperanto translation of Bolesław Prus' historical novel, \"Faraon\" (\"Pharaoh\"), and one of the first Esperanto dictionaries, \"Vortaro de Esperanto\".\n\nBein is, however, probably best known for his sudden, comment-less 1911 disappearance from the Esperanto scene. Interviewed twenty years later, in 1931, by the Esperanto magazine, \"Literatura Mondo\" (World of Literature), he spoke of Esperanto's stalled progress, and said that he no longer regarded the language as a viable solution to the need for an international language.\n\nShortly after he had left the movement, Esperantists coined the word \"kabei\", after \"Kabe,\" meaning \"to fervently and successfully participate in Esperanto, then suddenly and silently drop out.\" The expression, \"kabei\", remains in use by Esperantists to this day.\n\n"}

It is called \"Guanyinqiao\" in \"Ethnologue\" after a town in western Sichuan where one dialect of the language is spoken, Thugsrje Chenbo (). It has been referred to as \"Lavrung\" in previous publications.\n\n identifies two major branches of Khroskyabs: Core Khroskyabs dialects and Njorogs (业隆话). Core-Khroskyabs dialects are further divided into Phosul and Thugschen. The Thugschen dialects include Siyuewu (斯跃武), Wobzi (俄热), 'Brongrdzong (木尔宗) and Guanyinqiao (观音桥).\n\n\nThe Wobzi dialect has 42 consonantal phonemes, shown in the table below. Other Khroskyabs dialects exhibit similar systems.\n\nKhroskyabs dialects present complex consonant clusters. A consonant cluster in Wobzi is composed of three parts, preinitial(s), initial and medial, which can be tested through a partial reduplication process. 757 consonant clusters are attested according to . A single cluster can contain up to six consonants in a row: \"ʁjnlzdə̂\" \"to be made to buy for one's benefit\".\n\nThe ordering of preinitials in a consonant cluster follows a language-specific sonority hierarchy :\n\nʁ- > j- > N-, m- > v-, > r-, l- > s-, z-\n\nWobzi Khroskyabs has 9 vowel phonemes, listed in the table below. One diphthong is found, \"æi\". Most Core-Khroskyabs dialects have similar vowel systems. In Phosul, a complete series of velarised consonants are attested : \"iˠ\", \"uˠ\", \"eˠ\", \"oˠ\", \"ʌˠ\".\n\nExcept for conjugated verb forms, Khroskyabs does not allow complex codas. In the Wobzi dialect, complex codas are prohibited even in conjugated verbs. The rhymes attested in Wobzi Khroskyabs are listed in the table below, with forms in conjugated verbs between parentheses.\n\nTwo tones are attested in Khroskyabs, a high (H) tone, noted σ́, and a high-falling (HL) tone, noted σ̂. Some minimal pairs in Wobzi Khroskyabs are illustrated in the table below.\n\nOnly one syllable in a phonological word can bear a tone, and the surface tones of the other syllable(s), if existent, are derived from the tone-bearing syllable.\n\nKhroskyabs dialects present two number markers, \"=ne\" for dual and \"=ɟi\" for plural: \"kɑpə̂=ne\" (book=) \"two books\", \"kɑpə̂=ɟi\" (book=) \"(more than two) books\". Like many Asian languages, number markers are prohibited when a numeral is present:\n\nKhroskyabs presents a rich array of classifiers. A non-exhaustive list of classifiers in the Wobzi dialects is shown below (with the numeral prefix \"ə̂-\" \"one\").\n\nVocative is formed by assigning a high-falling tone to the penultimate syllable of a noun phrase.\n\nA series of enclitic case markers are attested in Khroskyabs. The Wobzi case markers are listed in the table below.\n\nThe Khroskyabs verb exhibits a templatic morphology with a strong prefixing preference, which means every affix is obligatorily positioned in its own slot which is impossible to change. The table below shows the verbal template of Wobzi Khroskyabs . \nPrefixes: -1: Incorporated noun; -2: Reflexive \"ʁjæ̂\"; -3: Causative \"s-\" and \"z-\"; -4: Causative \"v-\"; -5: Autobenefactive \"N-\"; -6: Intransitive-passive \"ʁ-\"; -7: Conditional \"zə̂-\"; -8: Negative \"mə-\"/\"mɑ-\"/\"mæ-\"/\"tə-\", interrogative \"ɕə-\"; -9: Inverse \"u-\", irrealis \"ɑ̂-\"', interrogative \"ə̂-\";-10: Orientational prefixes \"æ-\", \"næ-\", \"kə-\", \"nə-\", \"læ-\", \"və-\", \"rə-\"; -11 Progressive \"sə̂\"-, superlative \"sə̂-\".\n\nSuffixes: 1: Person endings: -ŋ, -j, -n; 2: Reduplication\n\nIn the following subsections, some characteristics of the affixes are presented.\n\nThe superlative prefix \"sə̂-\" is compatible with stative verbs and only very few dynamic verbs: \"sə̂-tsʰa\" (-be.good) 'best', but *\"sə̂-və\" (-go).\n\nNegative has four allomorphs. \"mə-\" is used when no other prefix precedes: \"mə-tsʰâ\" (-be.good) (it is not good); \"mæ-\" is used when an orientational prefix precedes: \"næ-mæ-tsʰâ\" (--be.good); \"mɑ-\" is used in perfective or past forms of a verb that prohibits the use of orientational prefixes in such situations: \"mɑ-vdé\" (-see) '(s)he did not see' (\"vdê\" 'to see' does not allow any orientational prefix in past form); \"tə-\" is used in irrealis situations, imperative, jussive and conditional with \"ɑ̂-\" (not \"zə̂-\"): \"æ-tə-dzî-n\" (--eat-2) 'Don't eat!'; \"ɑ̂-tə-dzi\" (--eat) 'Let her/him not eat. '\n\nThe interrogative prefixes \"ə̂-\" and \"ɕə-\" cannot coexist.\n\nThe irrealis prefix \"ɑ̂-\" and the conditional prefix \"zə̂-\" cannot coexist.\n\nThe causative prefix \"s-\" in Wobzi Khroskyabs undergoes various morphophonological processes, including voicing assimilation, lateral dissimilation, affrication, metathesis and lateral assimilation.\n\n• Voicing assimilation: \"s-\" becomes voiced \"z-\" before voiced stops and stays voiceless before voiceless consonants and sonorants.\n\n\"s-\" + \"kʰɑ̂\" 'to give' → \"s-kʰɑ̂\" 'to cause to give'\n\n\"s-\" + \"gí\" 'to wear' → \"z-gí\" 'to cause to wear'\n\n\"s-\" + \"mó\" 'to be hundry' → \"s-mó\" 'to cause to be hundry\"\n\n• Lateral dissimilation: \"s-\" becomes \"l-\" or \"ɬ-\" (depending on the voicing of the following consonant) when it precedes dental fricatives and affricates.\n\n\"s-\" + \"sɑ̂\" 'to kill' → \"ɬ-sɑ̂\" 'to cause to kill'\n\n\"s-\" + \"dzî\" 'to eat' → \"l-dzî\" 'to cause to eat'\n\n• Affrication: Affrication is not productive in Wobzi Khroskyabs. Its trace can be found in the causativisation of the verb \"rʑə̂\" 'to wash', \"l-dʑə̂\" 'to cause to watch', in which the fricative \"ʑ-\" becomes an affricate, \"dʑ-\".\n\n• Metathesis: There are two types of metatheses in Wobzi Khroskyabs, prefix ordering metathesis and \"vCVr\" metathesis.\n\nThe prefix ordering metathesis follows the sonority hierarchy of the preinitials. If the prefix \"s-\" is to be added to a verb stem already containing preinitials that ranks higher in the sonority hierarchy, it must be metathesised.\n\n\"s-\" + \"ʁbɑ́ɣ\" 'to explode' → \"ʁ⟨z⟩bɑ́ɣ\" 'to cause to explode\"\n\n\"s-\" + \"jbə̂v\" 'to be swollen' → \"j⟨z⟩bə̂v\" 'to cause to be swollen'\n\nThe preinitials \"l-\" and \"r-\", \"N-\" and \"m-\" drop when the causative prefix \"s-\" is added, while the case is optional for the preinitials \"j-\" and \"v-\".\n\n\"s-\" + \"mkʰæ̂\" 'to be expert' → \"m⟨s⟩kʰæ̂\" → \"s-kʰæ̂\" 'to cause to be expert'\n\n\"s-\" + \"rlǽ\" 'to peel' → \"r⟨s⟩lǽ\" → \"s-lǽ\" 'to cause to peel'\n\n\"s-\" + \"ɬqʰǽl\" 'to be dirty' → \"ɬ⟨s⟩qʰǽl\" → \"s-qʰǽl\" 'to cause to be dirty'\n\n\"vCVr\" metathesis, as its name suggests, concerns verbs with \"v-\" as preinitial and \"-r\" as coda.\n\n\"s-\" + \"vzɑ́r\" 'to be spicy' → \"l-zɑ́v\" 'to cause to be spicy'\n\n\"vcVr\" metathesis is a Wobzi-specific process, not found in other Khroskyabs dialects.\n\n• Some verbs with a falling tone undergo tone change into a high one when causative \"s-\" is applied. The process is not productive.\n\n\"s-\" + \"tʰê\" 'to drink' → \"s-tʰé\" 'to cause to drink'\n\"s-\" + \"nɑ̂r\" 'to burn' → \"s-nɑ́r\" 'to cause to burn'\n\"s-\" + \"brê\" 'to be loud'→ \"z-bré\" 'to play (instrument)'\n\n• The causative form of the verb \"çtə̂\" 'to be short' is \"s-tə́m\" 'to shorten', with an additional -m coda, which may be the reflex of an old stem alternation.\n\nAutobenefactive \"N-\" appears as an archiphoneme having several surface forms according to the phonological environment, especially the place of articulation.\n\n\"N-\" + \"pʰó\" 'to cut' → \"m-pʰó\" 'to harvest'\n\n\"N-\" + \"dʑə̂dʑə\" 'to drag' → \"n-dʑə̂dʑə\" 'to drag for oneself'\n\n\"N-\" + \"cʰǽ\" 'to be big' → \"ɲ-cʰǽ\" 'to grow'\n\n\"N-\" + \"kʰú\" 'to wear (shoe, sock)' → \"ŋ-kʰú\" 'to wear for oneself'\n\n\"N-\" + \"qá\" 'to pull out' → \"ɴ-qá\" 'to pull out for oneself'\n\nNoun incorporation is attested in Wobzi Khroskyabs as well as other Khroskyabs dialects. The incorporational construction is mainly formed by a nominal part (in its full form or \"Status Constructus\" form) and a verbal part. In many cases, a denominal prefix is attached to incorporational forms. \n\n\"fɕî\" 'tooth' + \"zê\" 'to be small' → \"fɕîze\" 'to be young'\n\n\"N-\" 'denominal prefix' + \"tɕʰæ-\" (\"Status Constructus\" of \"tɕʰî\" 'road') + \"fsê\" 'to lead' → \"ntɕʰæ̂fse\" 'to guide'\n\n\"s-\" 'denominal prefix' + \"kʰrə̂m\" 'discipline' + \"ɕǽ\" 'to go' → \"skʰrəmɕǽ\" 'to scold'\n\nUsually, the nominal part precedes the verbal part, but one example with the verbal part preceding the nominal part is attested:\n\n\"N-\" 'denominal prefix' + \"tsʰə̂r\" 'to milk' + \"lú\" 'milk' → \"ntsʰərlú\" 'to be good at lactating (cows)'\n\nKhroskyabs dialects distinguish transitive verbs from intransitive verbs unambiguously. Argument indexation presents two patterns, the intransitive pattern and the transitive pattern.\n\nThe intransitive paradigm in Wobzi Khroskyabs is illustrated in the table below. There are three suffixes, first person singular \"-ŋ\", first person non-singular (or plural) \"-j\", and second person \"-n\". Third person is unmarked. The subject argument agrees with verb. \n\nThe transitive paradigm exhibits a hierarchical alignment. Khroskyabs has a 1>2>3 empathy hierarchy. In terms of suffixes, within SAP (Speech-act participants, usually first and second persons) arguments, the verb indexes the P (patientive argument), otherwise it indexes the SAP argument, if exists. The inverse prefix \"u-\" occurs when the P ranks higher than the A, as well as almost all 3→3 scenarios with a TAM prefix on the verb. In all inverse and 3→3 scenarios, the ergative marker \"=ɣə\" must occur on the A. The transitive paradigm in Wobzi Khroskyabs is shown in the table below. \n\nBelow are some examples of the direct configuration:\n\nThe inverse configuration:\n\nIn 3→3 scenarios, if there is a TAM prefix, the inverse marker must occur, otherwise it does not surface. \n\nArgument indexation in Wobzi Khroskyabs is largely simplified compared to other Khroskyabs dialects. Guanyinqiao, Siyuewu and 'Brongrdzong all present the distinction between singular, dual and plural for first and second persons. The Siyuewu transitive paradigm is illustrated below. \n\nMost Khroskyabs verbs present two stems, a few verbs present three stems, and only a handful have only one stem. Roughly speaking, Stem 1 is used in non-past, Stem 2 in past, and Stem 3 in irrealis contexts. If a verb presents only two stems (without Stem 3), the functions of Stem 3 is covered by Stem 1; and if a verb presents only Stem 1, Stem 1 covers the functions of both Stem 2 and Stem 3. Some verbs may only present Stem 2. \n\nIn all the Khroskyabs dialects known to us, there are generally 5 strategies of stem alternation: tone alternation (glottal inversion), rime alternation, aspration alternation and suppletion. The following description is mainly based on the Wobzi dialect, if not specifically mentioned differently.\n\nTone alternation is by far the most common strategy between Stem 1 and Stem 2. For monosyllabic verbs, a simple inversion between the high tone and the high falling tone is observed. If the original tone is high, the Stem 2 will be assigned a falling tone and if the original tone is falling, the Stem 1 will be assigned a high tone. \n\n\"gí\" 'to put on (Stem 1)' → \"gî\" 'to put on (Stem 2)'\n\n\"kʰɑ̂\" 'to give (Stem 1)' → \"kʰɑ́\" 'to give (Stem 2)'\n\nAs for polysyllabic verbs, there are two situations. If the last syllable has a high tone, it will change to a falling tone in Stem 2, otherwise a high tone is assigned to the last syllable in Stem 2. \n\n\"ɴqʰɑrŋɑ́\" 'to expel (Stem 1)' → \"ɴqʰɑrŋɑ̂\" 'to expel (Stem 2)'\n\n\"tɕə̂rə\" 'to tear (Stem 1)' → \"tɕərə́\" 'to tear (Stem 2)'\n\n\"ndʐəvɑ̂\" 'to walk (Stem 1)' → \"ndʐəvɑ́\" 'to walk (Stem 2)'\n\nRime alternation is also widely attested. Rime alternation is usually combined with tone alternation. \n\nIn many cases, only the vowel is changed in Stem 2. \n\n\"lǽ\" 'to release (Stem 1)' → \"lî\" 'to release (Stem 2)'\n\n\"mɑ́ɣ\" 'not to be (Stem 1)' → \"mə̂ɣ\" 'not to be (Stem 2)'\n\nIn some other cases, the rime in Stem 2 is changed to \"-əɣ\" in spite of the original rime. \n\n\"fsǽ\" 'to be full (Stem 1)' → \"fsə̂ɣ\" 'to be full (Stem 2)'\n\n\"ndzræ̂v\" 'to suck (Stem 1)' → \"ndzrə́ɣ\" 'to suck (Stem 2)'\n\nSome Stem 2 forms present open syllables, while their corresponding Stem 1 forms are closed syllables. \n\n\"vʑǽr\" 'to shave (Stem 1)' → \"vʑî\" 'to shave (Stem 2)'\n\nAspiration alternation is rare. It is only attested in \"(rə-)tô\" 'to come (Stem 1)', whose Stem 2 is \"(rə-)tʰó\". \n\nSuppletion is found in three-stem verbs. These verbs are motion verbs or conveyance verbs. See the table below. \n\nVerb stems usually combine with orientational prefixes to express different properties of tense, aspect, modality and evidentiality. Stem 1 is employed in non-past contexts, Stem 2 in past and perfective contexts and Stem 3 in irrealis contexts. \n\nA verb in Stem 1 can be used without an orientational prefix for a generic fact. It can also combine with the orientational prefix \"rə-\" in a sensory or inferential non-past context.\n\nStative verbs distinguish past imperfective from perfective, while dynamic verbs present only a general past tense. Stem 2 is required in these situations. Examples of the Stem 2 of the stative verb \"ndæ̂\" 'to like' is illustrated below. \n\nDynamic verbs do not make the distinction between imperfective and perfective, therefore, their meaning in Stem 2 depends on the context.\n\n"}
{"id": "24733310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24733310", "title": "Korean verbs", "text": "Korean verbs\n\nVerbs in the Korean language come in last place in a clause. Verbs are the most complex part of speech, and a properly conjugated verb may stand on its own as a complete sentence. This article uses the Yale romanization in bold to show morphology.\nKorean verbs are typically classified into four categories: action, state (or description), existential, and the copulas.\n\n\nThe distinction between action verbs and descriptive verbs is visible in verb conjugation in a few places. The copulas conjugate like stative verbs, but the existential verbs conjugate like action verbs. Some verbs can be either stative or active, depending on meaning.\n\nKorean verbs are conjugated. Every verb form in Korean has two parts: a verb stem, simple or expanded, plus a sequence of inflectional suffixes. Verbs can be quite long because of all the suffixes that mark grammatical contrasts.\n\nA Korean verb root is bound, meaning that it never occurs without at least one suffix. These suffixes are numerous but regular and ordered. There are over 40 basic endings, but over 400 when the combinations of these endings are counted. Grammatical categories of verb suffixes include voice (passive or causative), tense (past, present, or future), aspect (of an action – complete, experienced, repeated, or continuing), honorification (appropriate choice of suffix following language protocol), and clause-final conjunctives or sentence enders chosen from various speech styles and types of sentences such as interrogative, declarative, imperative, and suggestive.\n\nA great many verbs change the pronunciation of the final consonant of the root after the addition of a suffix. Some of these changes are the result of regular consonant assimilation or cluster simplification, but some of them are irregular. The irregular verbs contain root-final consonants that were historically lenited and which, as a result disappeared or mutated between vowels but remained next to a consonant.\n\nThe lemma or citation form of a Korean verb is the form that ends in ta \"da\".\n\nBesides a verbal root itself that precedes ta in the citation form, there is also a long stem with an additional harmonic vowel, called by linguist Samuel E. Martin the \"infinitive\" form. This tense-neutral form also does not express any honorifics and speech levels. Thus they are often used for literary titles, subtitles and chapter titles, since they’re not specifically directed toward an individual or a group. \n\nThis so-called infinitive, however, must not be confused with the citation form mentioned above. It is formed by attaching \"eo/a\" to the root, according to vowel harmony. If the verbal root ends in a vowel, the two vowels may merge or contract.\n\nWithout vowel contraction\n\nWith vowel contraction\n\ntoy da 되다 \"doeda\" \"to become\" may or may not undergo contraction. ha ta 하다 \"hada\" \"to do\" is irregular.\n\nThis infinitive form is not used as a noun, but it can be used in compound verbs, serial verb constructions, and before certain (not all) verb endings. It may be compared to the combining stem in Japanese.\n\nVerbs are the most complex part of speech in Korean. Their structure when used as the predicate of a clause is prefix + root + up to seven suffixes, and can be illustrated with a template:\n\nI Valency may be passive or causative. These often involve a stem change, followed by the suffix i (the spelling of this suffix may change, depending on the stem change of the verb)\n\nII The honorific suffix is -usi \"-eusi-\" after a consonant, -si after a vowel. The i is reduced to a glide before another vowel. For example, with a following past tense, sie-ss \"-si-eoss-\" reduces to sye-ss \"-syeoss-.\"\n\nIII If there is no suffix in this slot, the verb is in present or gnomic tense. Future tense & prospective aspect is key-ss \"-get-,\" past perfective is --ss \"-eot-\"/\"-at\" but with vowel harmony. If there is no intervening consonant, this reduces, both in pronunciation and in writing: a-ss to \"at-\", and \"wa-ss\" to \"wat-\". The verb o \"to come\" is therefore wa-ss \"wat-\" in the perfective. The verb ha \"ha\" \"to do\" is an irregular hay \"hae-\" in the perfective.\n\nIV The formal suffix is -p after a vowel (it is normally written in the same block as that vowel), -sup \"-seup\" after a consonant in a declarative or interrogative verb, -up \"-eup\" after a consonant in a proposition. (After a consonant s or ss the letter in the suffix drops.)\n\nV The syntactic moods, for want of a better term, are the indicative -nun \"-neun,\" -ni , or n ; the retrospective (imperfective) -ten \"-deon\", ti \"-di\", or t \"-d-\"; and the subjunctive si \"-si\" or s . None of these are used in the casual or intimate styles, and the formal plain indicative declarative can only occur in the gnomic tense.\n\nVI The pragmatic moods, for want of a better term, are the declarative -ta \"-da\" (formal polite), -la \"-ra\" (formal plain), and ey \"-e\" (familiar); interrogative kka , ya (formal) and -ka \"-ga\" (familiar); propositive -ta \"-da\" (formal polite), -ca \"-ja\" (formal plain), and ey \"-e\" (familiar); and the imperative o (formal polite), - la \"-eola\"/\"-ala\" (formal plain), and -key \"-ge\" (familiar).\n\nVII The polite suffix yo (-i yo after a consonant) appears in the informal styles. It expresses one's relationship to the audience.\n\nA verb is typically negated in Korean by using a suppletive negative form, if it exists, or by putting a negative prefix in front of it.\n\nThere are two possible negative prefixes: mos \"mot\", and an . mos and an(i). mos is used for when a person or animate being subject tries to accomplish an action, that is, begins and is unable to finish it successfully. an is a more common negative which is used in all other instances. The two prefixes are mutually exclusive.\n\nDerivational endings are attached directly to the verb root, and are followed by the tense suffixes. These derivational suffixes end with the high vowels i or wu which is reduced to a glide in the long stem form. For example, with a following past tense, -(u)si \"-(eu)si\" reduces to -(u)sye-ss \"-(eu)syeot\".\n\nValency in Korean is partly lexical and partly derivational. Many forms can change their valency by the addition of the passive or causative derivational suffixes, -i , -hi , -li \"-ri\", -ki , -wu \"-u\", -kwu \"-gu\", or -chwu \"-chu\", sometimes with additional changes to the stem.\n\nThe subject honorific suffix -(u)si derives an honorific verb, that is, a verb which is used when the subject of a sentence is higher in social status than the speaker. Such verbs are used, for example, when speaking of one's elders, one's social superiors (parents, teachers, bosses), or strangers.\n\nThe full form -usi is only used after a consonant. Otherwise, the initial vowel is absorbed, becoming -si.\n\nWhile the honorific suffix is necessary, some verbs have honorific alternatives which must be used in addition to -(u)si. For instance, iss ta \"itda\" becomes kyey'si ta \"gyesida\".\n\nFollowing the derivational endings, Korean verbs can contain up to three suffixes in a row which represent a combination of tense, aspect, and mood.\n\nThis suffix is an enclitic consonant 'ss after the infinitive form of the verb (ending in ), forming 'ss (the final consonant is pronounced before a vowel and before a consonant). This suffix, which is conventionally called \"past\" or \"perfective\" by various linguists, has many different meanings, depending on the semantics of the verb that it is attached to and the context; it may be a simple past or a present perfect.\n\nEtymologically, 'ss is a contraction of the existential verb iss via vowel absorption. The contracted form - iss, was originally a present perfect.\n\nA verb can superficially have two copies of the above-mentioned suffix, the second of which, however, is always -ess \"-eot\" and represents a true past tense. This results in the combination 'ss.ess \"-eosseot/-asseot\". This combination communicates a more remote past or a past perfect.\n\nThe future suffix is -keyss \"-get\", often used to describe future events. It is used, when the speaker has valid reasons to believe something will be certain to happen. For instance, the suffix is used in broadcasting contexts in Korean such as weather forecasts.\n\nBut it may be used together with the perfective and remote past suffixes, or in a present tense context. If used with the perfective suffix, this makes an inferential or conditional past -'ss-keyss \"-eotget/-atget\" \"should have, would have, must have.\" If used with the remote past suffix it makes an inferential or conditional remote past -'ss-ess-keyss \"-eosseotget\"/-\"asseotget\", though this is rare. Because this infix is occasionally used for a conditional, or inferential tense, depending on context it is sometimes called irrealis.\n\nEtymologically, the future suffix is the result of the merger of a resultative verb ending -key and the existential root iss , via vowel absorption, as mentioned above. This contraction and change in meaning has its parallel in the future tense of Vulgar Latin.\n\nNot all combinations of the suffixes in the template above are possible. The most common sequences after the tense suffix (that is, after the root or honorific -usi in the present tense, after the -ss or -keyss in the past and future) are,\n\nThe intimate, intimate polite, casual, and casual polite endings are simpler.\n\nThe formal suffix is -(su)p \"-(seu)p\". The short form is used after a vowel and the long form is used after a consonant. (In the Korean writing system hangul, the is written at the bottom of the previous syllable. In South Korea, after or , the syllable \"was\" written as . This rule was modified at the end of the 80s, and is not the standard language. So, nowadays, the syllable is written as as its own pronunciation.) This shows deference towards the audience of the conversation, for example when speaking in a formal situation, such as \"to\" (but not necessarily \"about\") one's elders. If speaking both to and of one's elders, one would use the formal and the honorific suffixes together.\n\nThe syntactic moods, for want of a better term, are indicative -nun \"-neun\", -n(i) ; retrospective (imperfective) -ten \"-deon\", -t(i) ; and jussive -s(i).\n\nNone of these are used in the casual or intimate styles, and only the formal plain indicative declarative can occur in the gnomic tense.\n\nThe pragmatic moods, for want of a better term, are the declaratives ta , la , and ey ; interrogatives kka , ya , and ka ; propositive ta , -ca , and -ey ; and the imperative o , - la , and -key .\n\nThese distinctions are not made in the intimate and casual styles. Instead, this place is taken by the intimate suffix - or the casual suffix -ci .\n\nThe polite suffix yo appears in the lower speech levels. It raises the level of politeness of those styles.\n\nAttributive verb endings modify nouns and take the place of attributive adjectives. Korean does not have relative pronouns. Instead, attributive verbs modify nouns, as adjectives do in English. Where in English one would say \"I saw the man who walks the dog\", the structure of Korean is more like \"The dog-walking man I saw\".\n\nThe structure is ROOT + valence + attributive suffix, with little of the complexity of finite verbs above.\n\nActive verbs use the attributive suffix -un \"-eun\" after a consonant, or -n after a vowel, for the past tense. For descriptive or stative verbs, often equivalent to adjectives in English, this form is used for generic (gnomic) descriptions; effectively, \"eaten food\" is food which once was eaten (past), whereas \"a pretty flower\" is a flower which has become pretty, and still is (present/timeless). To specify the ongoing action for an active verb, the invariable suffix -nun \"-neun\" is used instead. This is not found on descriptive verbs, as it makes no sense to say that *\"a flower is being pretty\". For the future, the suffix -(u)lq (\"-(eu)l\" with reinforcement of the following consonant) is used, and in the imperfective/retrospective (recalling what once was) it is -ten \"-deon\".\n\nFor example, from the verb meok \"meok\" \"to eat\", the adjective yeyppu \"yeppeu\" \"pretty\", and the nouns pap \"bap\" \"cooked rice\" and kkoch \"kkot\" \"flower\", we get:\n\nThe perfective suffix -e-ss \"-eoss-\" is sometimes used as well, with the same meaning, on active verbs. It precedes the attributive suffix:\n\n\nFor action verbs, -e'ss is used for completed actions or processes that result in a present state. The individual verb’s meaning can help determine which interpretation is appropriate. Hence kyel.hon-hay'ss ta \"gyeorhon haetda\" can mean ‘got married’, focusing on the past event, or ‘is married’, focusing on the present state resulting from the past event. But kong ul cha'ss ta \"gong-eul chatda\" ‘kicked the ball’ can only denote a past action and cal sayngkye'ss ta \"jal saenggyeotda\" ‘is handsome’ can only denote the present state. (sayngkita \"saenggida\" is an action verb, meaning ‘get formed/created’.)\nVerbs can take conjunctive suffixes. These suffixes make subordinate clauses.\n\nOne very common suffix ko \"-go\", can be interpreted as a subordinating conjunction. That is, mek.ko \"meokko\" means approximately \"eating,\" koki'l ul mek.ko \"gogireul meokko\" means \"eating meat,\" and nay ka koki'l ul mek.ko \"naega gogireul meokko\" means \"I eat meat and...\" or \"My eating meat.\"\n\nAnother suffix, somewhat similar in meaning, is se \"-seo\" which is, however, attached to the long stem of a verb ending in -.\n\nBoth juxtapose two actions, the action in the subclause and the action in the main clause. The difference between them is that with se the action in the subclause necessarily came first, while -ko conveys more of an unordered juxtaposition. Se is frequently used to imply causation, and in many common expressions like manna se pankapsupni ta \"mannaseo bangapseumnida\" (literally, \"Since I met you, I'm happy\" or \"Having met you, I'm happy\"). If -ko was used instead, the meaning would be closer to \"I meet you and I'm happy,\" that is, without any implied logical connection.\n\nThese are both subordinating conjunctive suffixes and can not (in the more formal registers, at least) derive complete sentences of their own without the addition of a main verb, by default the existential verb iss ta \"itda\".\n\nAs a typical right-headed subject–object–verb language, verbs are typically the last element in a Korean sentence, and the only one necessary. That is, a properly conjugated verb can form a sentence by itself. The subject and the object of a sentence are often omitted when these are considered obvious in context. For example, the sentence: chac.ass.ta \"chajatda!\" (\"[I] found [it]!\") consists of only a verb because the context in which this sentence would occur makes the identity of the arguments obvious.\n"}

After completing her secondary education in her home town, she was accepted into the University of Munich, where she gained a doctorate in Classics and Egyptology in 1935. Soon after. she started work at the Egyptology and Archaeology Department of the Berlin State Museums, but she was dismissed from the post when it was discovered that her mother was a Jew.\n\nBosse left Germany for Britain and found research work at the Petrie Museum at the University College London and later at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. In 1938, while at Oxford, as a senior member of Somerville College she met fellow Egyptologist J. Gwyn Griffiths. Griffiths, a Welsh and Classics scholar brought up in the Rhondda, was at that time a research student at Oxford, but the two of them returned to the Rhondda and made their home in the village of Pentre. They married in 1939 and Bosse became Käte Bosse-Griffiths.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Bosse-Griffiths and her husband set up the Cadwgan Circle from their home in Pentre, an avant-garde literary and intellectual group whose members included Pennar Davies and Rhydwen Williams. Among these literary Welsh speakers, Bosse-Griffiths found a love of the Welsh language. During the same years in Germany, Bosse-Griffiths's mother died at Ravensbrück, a notorious women's concentration camp. Her brothers Günther and Fritz were both imprisoned, and then served at Zöschen camp. An order to have them killed at the end of the war was not carried out. Her sister Dorothee was imprisoned for six weeks but released.\n\nWhen her husband became a lecturer at Swansea University, the couple moved to Uplands and then Sketty in Swansea. Bosse-Griffiths became a member of Swansea Museum, where she was Keeper of Archaeology, a role she would undertake for 25 years. She helped bring Sir Henry Wellcome's Egyptian collection, at the time held in storage, to the Department of Classics at Swansea, and would spend the next twenty years researching this 5,000 piece collection. This Wellcome collection is now housed at the Egypt Centre at Swansea University.\n\nBosse-Griffiths was also a published author. She wrote on German pacifist movements in \"Mudiadau Heddwch yn yr Almaen\" (1942) in the Welsh language, while academic works include her 1955 collection \"Amarna Studies and Other Collected Papers\".\n\nBosse-Griffiths published scores of articles on archaeological matters. Her literary output of short stories and novels included \"Anesmwyth Hoen\" (1941), \"Fy Chwaer Efa a Storïau Eraill\" (1944), \"Mae'r Galon wrth y Llyw\" (1957; reprinted with a new introduction in 2016 by Honno Welsh Women's Classics), and \"Cariadau\" (1995), and two travel books, \"Trem ar Rwsia a Berlin\" (1962), and \"Tywysennau o'r Aifft\" (1970).\n\n"}

{"id": "31999585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31999585", "title": "Language learning strategies", "text": "Language learning strategies\n\nLanguage learning strategies is a term referring to the processes and actions that are consciously deployed by language learners to help them to learn or use a language more effectively. They have also been defined as ‘thoughts and actions, consciously chosen and operationalized by language learners, to assist them in carrying out a multiplicity of tasks from the very outset of learning to the most advanced levels of target language performance’. The term language \"learner\" strategies, which incorporates strategies used for language learning and language use, is sometimes used, although the line between the two is ill-defined as moments of second language use can also provide opportunities for learning.\n\nLanguage learning strategies were first introduced to the second language literature in 1975, with research on the good language learner. At the time it was thought that a better understanding of strategies deployed by successful learners could help inform teachers and students alike of how to teach and learn languages more effectively. Initial studies aimed to document the strategies of good language learners. In the 80s the emphasis moved to classification of language learning strategies. Strategies were first classified according to whether they were direct or indirect, and later they were strategies divided into cognitive, metacognitive or affective/social categories.\n\nIn 1990, Rebecca Oxford published her landmark book \"Language Learning Strategies: What Every Teacher Should Know\" which included the \"Strategy Inventory for Language Learning\" or \"SILL\", a questionnaire which was used in a great deal of research in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nControversy over basic issues such as definition grew stronger in the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, with some researchers giving up trying to define the concept in favour of listing essential characteristics. Others abandoned the strategy term in favour of \"self regulation\".\n\nIn 1990, O'Malley and Chamot developed a classification of three types of language learning strategies:\nThis model was based on cognitive theory, which was commended, but it was also criticized for the ad hoc nature of its third category.\n\nAlso in 1990, Rebecca Oxford developed a taxonomy for categorizing strategies under six headings:\nIn later years this classification system was criticized for its problems in separating mnemonic stratgeies from cognitive strategies, when one is a sub-category of the other, and the inclusion of compensatory strategies, which are connected to how a learner uses the language, rather than learns it.\n\nMore recent research has examined language learner strategies in more context-specific situations, rather than catch-all categories. That is, when learners study academic writing, for example, they are likely to deploy a different set of strategies than if they were to study daily conversation. The terms cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies remain common in strategy research, but others related to managing a learners' own affective state or social environment have been examined under the umbrella term self-regulation.\n\nFirst, although originally promoted as a means of helping students to achieve success in language learning, a synthesis of historical research on language learning strategies has produced conflicting results on the relationship between strategies and language learning success. In fact, much of the research that emerged in the 1990s included numerous conflicting studies based on use of the SILL as a research instrument, of which very few met rigorous research criteria.\n\nA second problem associated with researching language learner strategies is the definitional fuzziness of major concepts in the field. Researchers in field, such as Ernesto Macaro argue there is a lack of consensus of: \nDue to the definitional fuzziness of language learning strategies, critics have argued the whole field should be replaced with the psychological concept of self-regulation. However, language learning strategy researchers have argued that replacing the field would be a matter of 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater' in that it throws away 30 years of research because of definitional issues. It has also been argued that self-regulation and language learning strategies are measuring different parts of the learning process, and thus can be used in tandem to observe a more accurate picture of how learners learn a second language.\n\nInterest in the potential of strategies to promote learning remains strong, however, as evidenced from recent books on the topic, and number of special issues of academic journals on the topic. A particularly important question for educators is whether learners can benefit from strategy instruction, both in terms of improved linguistic outcomes and improved self-efficacy for learning. For example, in a study within the context of England, Graham and Macaro (2008) found improved listening skills and improved self-efficacy for listening among learners of French who had received instruction in listening strategies. Another important question is also the extent to which teachers have knowledge and understanding of how to incorporate language learning strategies into their teaching, with research indicating that this is an area for development .\n\nLanguage learning strategies has naturally strong links to the fields of self-regulation, self-directed learning, and learner autonomy as they share core notions of independent learning, learner-centredness, and the necessity for learners to exercise responsibility for their own learning.\n\n\nLanguage learning tips"}

Beside Romanian, the countrywide official language, other spoken languages are spoken and sometimes co-official at a local level. These languages include Hungarian, Romani, Ukrainian, German, Russian, Turkish, Tatar, Serbian, Slovak, Bulgarian, and Croatian.\n\nAccording to the 2002 Romanian Census, Romanian is spoken by 91% of the population as a primary language. According to the Romanian Constitution and the law 1206 of 2006 the official language in Romania is Romanian both at the national and local level.\n\nAfter the fall of Romania's communist government in 1989, the various minority languages have received more rights, and Romania currently has extensive laws relating to the rights of minorities to use their own language in local administration and the judicial system.\n\nWhile Romanian is the only official language at the national and local level, there are 14 other living languages in Romania. The Romanian laws include linguistic rights for all minority groups that form over 20% of a locality's population. This includes the adoption of signage in minority languages, access to local administration and justice systems, the right to receive education in that language, and a series of other rights.\n\nHungarian is the largest minority language in Romania: the 2011 census listed 1,227,623 native Hungarian speakers in the country, or 6.1% of the total population. This minority largely lives in Transylvania, which was part of the Kingdom of Hungary until 1918 (Northern Transylvania was part of Hungary again between 1940 and 1947) though there are Hungarian speaking minorities in other parts of the country as well.\n\nRoma make up the second largest minority in Romania and 241,617 Romani speakers were reported in the 2002 census, or 1.1% of the total population. Dialects of Romani spoken include Balkan Romani, Vlax Romani, and Carpathian Romani. Romani is used in local signage, administration, education and justice in 79 communes and one town (Budești).\n\nThere are 57,593 Ukrainian speakers in Romania, mostly concentrated in Maramureș County, where they make up 6.67% of the population, but also in Suceava and Timiș counties. Ukrainians make up the majority in four communes: Bistra, Maramureș, Rona de Sus, Știuca and Copăcele.\n\nThere are many different groups of Germans in Romania, the largest of whom have historically been known as the Transylvanian Saxons and the Banat Swabians. Germans once constituted a much larger portion of the Romanian population than they do today, though they are still the fourth largest ethno-linguistic group. In 1938 there were 780,000, and in 1992 there were 111,301, but the 2002 census reported only 45,129 Germans. Since 1989 they have been represented by the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania, which functions in the German language.\n\nThere are 29,890 Lipovans, ethnically Russian emigrants from the Russian Empire who left because of religious differences with the Russian Orthodox Church, in Romania. They mostly speak the Russian language, and most live in Tulcea County.\n\nTurkish speakers make up 0.1% of the population, with a community of some 28,714 speakers. The Turkish speaking community is largely a legacy of the Ottoman rule of a large part of Romania. They live in the southern parts of Romania (Dobrudja).\n\nTatars also make up roughly 0.1% of the Romanian population, with a community of 21,482 speakers. Most Crimean Tatars speak the Crimean Tatar language, and the greater part of the community lives in Constanța County.\n\nLesser spoken languages in Romania include: Serbo-Croatian (26,732: 20,377 Serbians, 6,355 Croatians), Slovak (16,108), Bulgarian (6,747), Greek (4,146).\n\nThe use of French developed among Romanian elites from the 18th century, and today around a quarter of Romanians have studied French. Since 1993, Romania has been a member of Organisation internationale de la Francophonie despite not having a native French-speaking population or ever being part of any French empire.\n\n"}

Mesha tells how Chemosh, the god of Moab, had been angry with his people and had allowed them to be subjugated to Israel, but at length Chemosh returned and assisted Mesha to throw off the yoke of Israel and restore the lands of Moab. Mesha describes his many building projects. Some say it is written in the Phoenician alphabet, but others say it is written in the Old Hebrew script, which is closely related.\n\nThe stone was discovered intact by Frederick Augustus Klein, an Anglican missionary, at the site of ancient Dibon (now Dhiban, Jordan), in August 1868. Klein was led to it by a local Bedouin, although neither of them could read the text. At that time, amateur explorers and archaeologists were scouring the Levant for evidence proving the Bible's historicity. News of the finding set off a race between France, Britain and Germany to acquire the piece. A \"squeeze\" (a papier-mâché impression) had been obtained by a local Arab on behalf of Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, an archaeologist based in the French consulate in Jerusalem. The next year, the Stele was smashed into several fragments by the Bani Hamida tribe; seen as an act of defiance against the Ottoman authorities who had pressured the Bedouins to hand over the Stele so that it could be given to Germany. Clermont-Ganneau later managed to acquire the fragments and piece them together thanks to the impression made before the Stele's destruction.\n\nThe Mesha stele, the longest Iron Age inscription ever found in the region, constitutes the major evidence for the Moabite language, and is a \"corner-stone of Semitic epigraphy,\" and history. The stele, whose story parallels, with some differences, an episode in the Bible's Books of Kings (2 Kings 3:4–8), provides invaluable information on the Moabite language and the political relationship between Moab and Israel at one moment in the 9th century BCE. It is the most extensive inscription ever recovered that refers to the kingdom of Israel (the \"House of Omri\"); it bears the earliest certain extra-biblical reference to the Israelite god Yahweh, and—if French scholar André Lemaire's reconstruction of a portion of line 31 is correct—the earliest mention of the \"House of David\" (i.e., the kingdom of Judah). It is also one of four known contemporary inscriptions containing the name of Israel, the others being the Merneptah Stele, the Tel Dan Stele, and the Kurkh Monolith. Its authenticity has been disputed over the years, and some biblical minimalists suggest the text was not historical, but a biblical allegory, but the stele is regarded as genuine and historical by the vast majority of biblical archaeologists today.\n\nThe stele is currently on display in France at the Louvre museum and Jordan has demanded its return.\n\nThe stele is a smoothed block of basalt approximately one meter tall, 60 cm wide and 60 cm thick, bearing a surviving inscription of 34 lines.\n\nOn 8 February 1870, George Grove of the Palestine Exploration Fund announced the find of the stele in a letter to \"The Times\", attributing the discovery to Charles Warren. On 17 February 1870, the 24-year-old Clermont-Ganneau published the first detailed announcement of the stele in the Revue de l’Instruction Publique. This was followed a month later by a letter from Frederick Augustus Klein published in the \"Pall Mall Gazette\", describing his discovery of the stele in August 1868:\n\nIn November 1869 the stele was broken by the local Bedouin tribe (the Bani Hamida) after the Ottoman government became involved in the ownership dispute. The previous year the Bani Hamida had been defeated by an expedition to Balqa led by Reşid Pasha, the Wali of Damascus. Knowing that a demand to give up the stone to the German Consulate had been ordered by the Ottomans, and finding that the ruler of Salt was about to put pressure upon them, they heated the stele in a bonfire, threw cold water upon it and broke it to pieces with boulders.\n\nA \"squeeze\" (a papier-mâché impression) of the full stele had been obtained just prior to its destruction. Ginsberg's translation of the official report, \"Ueber die Auffindung der Moabitischen Inschrift,\" stated that Ganneau sent an Arab named Yacoub Caravacca to obtain the squeeze as he \"did not want to venture to undertake the very costly [and dangerous] journey\" himself. Caravacca was injured by the local Bedouin while obtaining the squeeze, and one of his two accompanying horsemen protected the squeeze by tearing it still damp from the stone in seven fragments before escaping.\n\nPieces of the original stele containing most of the inscription, 613 letters out of about a thousand, were later recovered and pieced together. Of the existing stele fragments, the top right fragment contains 150 letters, the bottom right fragment contains 358 letters, the middle-right contains 38, and the rest of the fragments contain 67 letters. The remainder of the stele was reconstructed by Ganneau from the squeeze obtained by Caravacca.\n\nThe text describes:\n\nThere is no authoritative full edition of the Moabite inscription. The translation used here is that published by James King (1878), based on translations by M. Ganneau and Dr. Ginsberg. Line numbers added to the published version have been removed.\nI am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad, king of Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I have reigned after my father. And I have built this sanctuary for Chemosh in Karchah, a sanctuary of salvation, for he saved me from all aggressors, and made me look upon all mine enemies with contempt. Omri was king of Israel, and oppressed Moab during many days, and Chemosh was angry with his aggressions. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab. In my days he said, Let us go, and I will see my desire upon him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy it for ever. Now Omri took the land of Madeba, and occupied it in his day, and in the days of his son, forty years. And Chemosh had mercy on it in my time. And I built Baal-meon and made therein the ditch, and I built Kiriathaim. And the men of Gad dwelled in the country of Ataroth from ancient times, and the king of Israel fortified Ataroth. I assaulted the wall and captured it, and killed all the warriors of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and Moab, and I removed from it all the spoil, and offered it before Chemosh in Kirjath; and I placed therein the men of Siran, and the men of Mochrath. And Chemosh said to me, Go take Nebo against Israel, and I went in the night and I fought against it from the break of day till noon, and I took it: and I killed in all seven thousand men, but I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-Chemosh; and I took from it the vessels of Jehovah, and offered them before Chemosh. And the king of Israel fortified Jahaz, and occupied it, when he made war against me, and Chemosh drove him out before me, and I took from Moab two hundred men in all, and placed them in Jahaz, and took it to annex it to Dibon. I built Karchah the wall of the forest, and the wall of the Hill. I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel. I built Aroer, and I made the road across the Arnon. I took Beth-Bamoth for it was destroyed. I built Bezer for it was cut down by the armed men of Daybon, for all Daybon was now loyal; and I reigned from Bikran, which I added to my land. And I built Beth-Gamul, and Beth-Diblathaim, and Beth Baal-Meon, and I placed there the poor people of the land. And as to Horonaim, the men of Edom dwelt therein, on the descent from old. And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim, and take it. And I assaulted it, And I took it, for Chemosh restored it in my days. Wherefore I made... ...year...and I...\n\nThe Mesha stele is the longest Iron Age inscription ever found in the region, the major evidence for the Moabite language, and a unique record of military campaigns. The occasion was the erection of a sanctuary for Kemosh in Qarho, the acropolis (citadel) of Dibon, Mesha's capital, in thanks for his aid against Mesha's enemies. Kemosh is credited with an important role in the victories of Mesha, but is not mentioned in connection with his building activities, reflecting the crucial need to give recognition to the nation's god in the life and death national struggle. The fact that the numerous building projects would have taken years to complete suggests that the inscription was made long after the military campaigns, or at least most of them, and the account of those campaigns reflects a royal ideology which wishes to present the king as the obedient servant of the god. The king also claims to be acting in the national interest by removing Israelite oppression and restoring lost lands, but a close reading of the narrative leaves it unclear whether all the conquered territories were previously Moabite – in three campaign stories there is no explicit reference to prior Moabite control.\n\nThe inscription seems to parallel an episode in : Jehoram of Israel makes an alliance with Jehoshaphat king of Judah and an unnamed king of Edom (south of Judah) to put down his rebellious vassal Mesha; the three kings have the best of the campaign until Mesha, in desperation, sacrifices to his god Kemosh either his eldest son or the eldest son of the king of Edom; the sacrifice turns the tide, \"there came great wrath against Israel\", and Mesha apparently achieves victory. This apparent correspondence is the basis of the usual dating of the inscription to about 840 BCE, but André Lemaire has cautioned that the identification is not certain and the stele may be as late as 810 BCE.\n\nThe discovery of the Tel Dan Stele led to a reevaluation of the Mesha Stele by some scholars. In 1994, André Lemaire reconstructed BT[D]WD as \"House of David\", meaning Judah, in line 31. This section is badly damaged, but appears to tell of Mesha's reconquest of the southern lands of Moab, just as the earlier part dealt with victories in the north. Line 31 says that he captured Horonen from someone who was occupying it. Just who the occupants were is unclear. The legible letters are BT[*]WD, with the square brackets representing a damaged space that probably contained just one letter. This is not universally accepted—Nadav Na'aman, for instance, reads it as BT[D]WD[H], \"House of Daodoh\", a local ruling family; but if Lemaire is correct, then this is the earliest evidence of the existence of the Judean kingdom and its Davidic dynasty.\n\nIn 2001 Anson Rainey proposed that a two-word phrase in line 12—'R'L DWDH—should be read as a reference an \"altar hearth of David\" at Ataroth, one of the towns captured by Mesha. The sentence reads: \"I (i.e., Mesha) carried from there (Atartoth) the 'R'L of its DWD (or: its 'R'L of DVD) and I dragged it before Kemosh in Qeriot\". The meaning of both words is unclear. One line of thought sees 'R'L as the name of a man (literally \"El is my light\") and translates DWD as \"defender\", so that the sense of the passage is that Mesha, having conquered Ataroth, dragged its \"defender\", whose name was \"El is my light\", to the altar of Kemosh, where he was presumably sacrificed. It seems more likely that some kind of cult-vessel is meant, and other suggestions have included \"the lion-statue of its beloved\", meaning the city god.\n\nThe stele is regarded as genuine by the vast majority of biblical archaeologists today, on the basis that there were no other inscriptions of comparable age known to scholars at the time. Back then, the Assyrian lion weights were the oldest Phoenician-style inscription that had been discovered.\n\nIn the years following the discovery of the stele, a number of scholars questioned its authenticity, including Leopold Zunz, Moritz Steinschneider, Moses Gaster, F.W. Schulz, Gustav Jahn, Rupert Storr, and particularly Albert Löwy, who wrote two monographs disputing the authenticity of the stele in 1887 and 1903. Its authenticity was also challenged in detail by Abraham Yahuda in 1944 in his article, \"The Story of a Forgery and the Mēša Inscription\".\n\nThomas L. Thompson believes that the inscription on the Mesha stele is not historical, but an allegory. In 2000 he wrote: \"Rather than an historical text, the Mesha inscription belongs to a substantial literary tradition of stories about kings of the past... The phrase \"Omri, king of Israel,\" eponym of the highland patronate \"Bit Humri\", belongs to a theological world of Narnia.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He served as a faculty member in the capacities of professor and dean at the faculty of Law in the University of Dhaka. He also served as a lawyer. He is called \"Father of Bangladeshi theatre\" and \"Natyaguru of Bangladesh\" (\"The Grand Teacher of Drama and Theatre\").\n\nMomen was born on 25 November 1908. His father was Nurul Arefin, a physician and Zamindar (landlord) in Alfadanga, of the then Jessore district. (After the partition of India, from 1947, Alphadanga is in Faridpur district.) He went to primary school in Calcutta and was admitted in 1916 into Khulna Zila School. At the age of ten he wrote his first poem, \"Shondhya\" (Evening), in the same verse as Tagore's \"Shonar Tory\". In 1919 it was published in the journal \"Dhrubotara\". In 1920, he was enrolled in the Dhaka Muslim High School where he resided in the Dafrin Hostel. After matriculation in 1924 he studied at Dhaka Intermediate College. Passing intermediate, he enrolled for a BA at the newly established Dhaka University on 1926.\n\nWhile he was residing at \"Muslim Hall\" of Dhaka University, the various halls staged the then new play \"Muktadhara\" by Rabindranath Tagore. After some initial resistance, Momen received the main role of \"Botu\". This ignited his passion for drama and even earned him the first prize, but it was also the first time that he performed as actor himself.\n\nAfter receiving his B.A. from Dhaka University in 1929, he studied law at the Department of Law, University of Calcutta. Upon completing his B.L. examinations in 1936 he started practicing at the Calcutta High Court.\n\nAfter the foundation of All India Radio in Dhaka, 1939, Momen picked up on the opportunity of the new medium and became its first Muslim author. In 1941 he wrote and directed the comedy \"Rupantor\" (Transformation) for the radio. With its progressive plot and a female main character it differed vastly form traditional Muslim plays and was actually the first modern drama of Bangladesh. Upon initiative of the critic, the poet and literary critic Mohitlal Majumder, the play was also published in the yearly Puja issue of the newspaper Anandabazar.\n\nWhile he was in London for higher studies from 1948 on, Nurul Momen and his friend Nazir Ahmed started a BBC Bengali program, a weekly one-hour format called\" Anjuman\" where Momen was responsible for the literary content.\n\nRather than continuing to practice law even before the partition of India, Momen joined the faculty of Law at the Dhaka University in 1945. There he was known for including elements from literature and music into the law classes. He encouraged Munier Chowdhury to get interested in theater and become a playwright. Momen encouraged him to read George Bernard Shaw and got many other students interested in theatre. He later translated \"You Never Can Tell\". From 1948 until 1951 Momen was on leave from the university, undergoing higher studies in England and graduating in Law from London University.\n\n\nIn 1936 Momen married Amena Momen, née Khatun (died 1993).

He had set up an ashram at Bihta, near Patna and carried out most of his work in the later part of his life from there. He was an intellectual, prolific writer, social reformer and revolutionary.\n\nSahajanand Saraswati was born in Deva Village near Dullahpur, Ghazipur district in eastern North-Western Provinces in 1889 to a family of the Jujhautiya Brahmin which due to marital relations became one with Bhumihar Brahmins. He was the last of six sons and was then called Naurang Rai. His mother died when he was a child and he was raised by an aunt. His father, Beni Rai, was a cultivator and knew little about religion.\n\nThe Kisan Sabha movement started in Bihar under the leadership of Saraswati who had formed in 1929 the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha (BPKS) in order to mobilise peasant grievances against the zamindari attacks on their occupancy rights, and thus sparking the farmers' movements in India.\n\nGradually the peasant movement intensified and spread across the rest of India. All these radical developments on the peasant front culminated in the formation of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) at the Lucknow session of the Indian National Congress in April 1936 with Saraswati elected as its first President and it involved prominent leaders such as N. G. Ranga and E. M. S. Namboodiripad. The Kisan Manifesto, which was released in August 1936, demanded abolition of the zamindari system and cancellation of rural debts. In October 1937, the AIKS adopted the red flag as its banner. Soon, its leaders became increasingly distant with Congress, and repeatedly came in confrontation with Congress governments in Bihar and United Province.\n\nSaraswati organised the Bakasht Movement in Bihar in 1937–1938. \"Bakasht\" means self-cultivated. The movement was against the eviction of tenants from Bakasht lands by zamindars and led to the passing of the Bihar Tenancy Act and the Bakasht Land Tax. He also led the successful struggle in the Dalmia Sugar Mill at Bihta, where peasant-worker unity was the most important characteristic.\n\nOn hearing of Saraswati's arrest during the Quit India Movement, Subhash Chandra Bose and All India Forward Bloc decided to observe 28 April as All-India Swami Sahajanand Day in protest of his incarceration by the British Raj.\n\nSaraswati died on 26 June 1950.\n\nSubhash Chandra Bose, leader of the Forward Bloc, said: \n\nSaraswati's publications include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Government of India issued a commemorative stamp in commemoration of Saraswati on 26 June 2000 by Ram Vilas Paswan, the then Minister of Communications.\n\nThe Indian Council of Agricultural Research gives the Swamy Sahajanand Saraswati Extension Scientist/ Worker Award.\n\nIn 2001, a two-day Kisan Mahapanchayat was organised on the occasion of the 112th birth anniversary of Saraswati.\n\nBihar Governor R.

It is one of the four official languages of Singapore along with English, Malay and Tamil.\n\nSingaporean Mandarin can be classified into two distinct Mandarin dialects: Standard Singaporean Mandarin and Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin. These two dialects are easily distinguishable to a person proficient in Mandarin. Standard Singaporean Mandarin is the register of Mandarin used in more formal occasions in Singapore and can be heard on television and radio. It is also the form taught in all Singapore government schools, while Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin (Singdarin) is the form used by the general populace. They tend to infuse the language with many words from other Chinese dialects, Malay and English.\n\nSingaporean Mandarin only became widely spoken by the Chinese community in Singapore after the Speak Mandarin Campaign in 1979. It is today considered to be the second most commonly spoken language in Singapore, after English. Due to its widespread usage, Singaporean Mandarin has replaced Singaporean Hokkien as the lingua franca of the Chinese community in Singapore today. Following the economic rise of China in the 21st century, Mandarin proficiency has been viewed with greater importance and has risen in terms of prominence in Singapore. In 2010, there was an increase in the number of Singaporean population who know two or more languages.\n\nWith increasing influx of mainland Chinese from mainland China to Singapore recently, Singaporean Mandarin has gradually inclined itself towards Putonghua. Currently, Singaporean Mandarin continues to develop itself with major influences coming from Putonghua, Taiwanese Mandarin and English.\n\nThe official standard of Mandarin of Republic of Singapore, known in Singapore as \"Huayu\" (), is based on the phonology of the Beijing dialect and the grammar of Vernacular Chinese, is almost identical to the standard of Mandarin used in the People's Republic of China (known there as \"Pǔtōnghuà\" ) and the Republic of China (Taiwan) (known there as \"Guóyǔ\" ）. Standard Singaporean Mandarin, which is usually heard on Singaporean Mandarin-language TV and radio news broadcast, is generally similar to Guoyu in terms of phonology, and Putonghua in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Small differences only appear in the form of lexicon.\n\nIn terms of colloquial spoken Mandarin, Singaporean Mandarin is subjected to influence from the local historical, cultural and social influences of Singapore. As such, there are remarkable differences between colloquial Singaporean Mandarin and Putonghua. Owing to a common culture and history between the Chinese Singaporeans and Malaysian Chinese, Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin bears the closest resemblance with Colloquial Malaysian Mandarin.\n\nSingaporean Mandarin had preserved the vocabulary and certain features of the Classical Chinese and early Vernacular Chinese (baihua) of the early 20th century. Because Singapore's Chinese schools adopted Chinese teaching materials from Republic of China in the early 20th century, Singapore's early Mandarin pronunciations was based on the Zhuyin in the \"Dictionary of National Pronunciation\" () and \"Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use\" (). As such, it had preserved the older forms of pronunciations. In addition, during its initial development, Singaporean Mandarin was also influenced by Chinese dialects of Singapore such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese etc.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1979, due to lack of contact between Singapore and People's Republic of China, Putonghua did not exert any form of influence on Singaporean Mandarin. On the contrary, the majority of Mandarin Chinese entertainment media, Chinese literature, books and reading materials in Singapore came mainly from Taiwan. Consequently, Singaporean Mandarin has been influenced by Taiwanese Mandarin to a certain degree. After the 1980s, along with China's Open Door Policy, there was increasing contact between Singapore and mainland China, thus increasing Putonghua's gradual influence on Singaporean Mandarin. These influences included the adoption of pinyin and the shift from usage of Traditional Chinese characters to Simplified Chinese characters. Much of the lexicon from Putonghua had also found its way into Singaporean Mandarin.\n\nHistorical sources indicated that before 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles came to Singapore, there were already Chinese settlers in Singapore. After 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles set foot on Singapore, many Peranakan from Malaysian and European merchants began to come to Singapore. Because they required large number of labourers, coolies were brought in from China to Singapore.\n\nLarge number of Chinese labourers came to Singapore after the Opium War. Chinese settlers who came to Singapore from China during the 19th and second half of the 20th century were known as \"sinkeh\" (). Amongst them were many contract labourers, including those who worked at the docks. Most of them came to Singapore to escape from poverty and to search for a better life, while others came to Singapore to escape from wars taking place in China during the first half of the 20th century. Most of them came from Southern Chinese provinces such as Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan.\n\nAmongst these Sinkeh, there were many Hoklo (Hokkien), Teochew, Cantonese and Hainanese. They brought their own different native Chinese varieties to Singapore, including Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Hakka and Hainanese. Because these varieties were mutually unintelligible, Chinese clans association were established based on their own ancestral home and dialect groups to help take care of their own people who speak the same dialect.\n\nThe use of Mandarin to serve as a lingua franca amongst the Chinese only began with the founding of Republic of China, which established Mandarin as the official tongue.\n\nBefore the 20th century, Old-style private Chinese school known as \"sīshú\" () in Singapore generally used Chinese dialects (such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, etc.) as their medium of instruction to teach the Chinese classics and Classical Chinese. Singapore's first Mandarin-medium classes appeared around 1898, but Chinese dialects school continued to exist till 1909.\n\nAfter the May Fourth Movement in 1919, under the influence from the New Culture Movement in China, the local Old-style private Chinese school in Singapore began to follow the new education reform as advocated by China's reformist. Thus, the language of medium in school changed from other Chinese dialects to Mandarin Chinese or \"Guóyǔ\" (國語). This marked the beginning of the development of Singaporean Mandarin.\n\nHowever, at that time, there was no colloquial Standard Mandarin which could be used as a basis for learning Mandarin. In addition, during the early 1900s, most Mandarin teachers in Singapore came from southern parts of China, and had strong southern Chinese accents. Thus, the pronunciations in Singaporean Mandarin were under heavy influence from China's southern Chinese dialects; for instance, there were no erhua (), light tone (), and no sentences had the heavy or light accent () etc.\n\nIn 1919, a group of scholars in China published the \"Dictionary of National Pronunciation\". This was one of the earliest dictionaries on modern Mandarin based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin. However, the dictionary was a mix of northern Chinese sounds and southern Chinese rhymes, which included a 5th tone; the checked tone (\"rù shēng\" or ). It wasn't until 1932 that a dictionary called the \"Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use\", which was based truly on the Beijing dialect, was published. This dictionary standardized the form of Mandarin taught in Singapore's Chinese schools. During the 1930s and 1940s, new immigrants from China, known as \"xīn kè\" () helped to established more Chinese schools in Singapore, increasing the propagation of Mandarin Chinese in Singapore. The name of Mandarin in Singapore was eventually changed from \"Guoyu\" (, i.e. National Language) to \"Huayu\" (, i.e. Chinese Language).\n\nFrom the 1950s till 1970, as most of the Chinese books and literature came from Taiwan or Hong Kong, Singaporean Mandarin was subjected to influence from Taiwanese Mandarin. After the 1980s, due to the open door policy of mainland China, Singapore began to have greater contact with mainland China. Consequently, Singapore began to adopt Hanyu Pinyin and changed its writing system from Traditional Chinese characters to Simplified Chinese characters. After the Speak Mandarin Campaign in 1979, the Promote Mandarin Council started research on Mandarin standardization based on case studies in mainland China and Taiwan.\n\nAfter the 1990s, due to greater contacts between Singapore and mainland China, there was a large influx of new Chinese migrants from mainland China. Consequently, much of the lexicon of Putonghua found its way into Singaporean Mandarin. Today's Singaporean Mandarin continues to be influenced from Putonghua, as well as Taiwanese Mandarin and Hong Kong's Cantonese.\n\nMajor differences between Singaporean Mandarin \"Huayu\" () and Putonghua lie in the vocabulary used. A lack of contact between Singapore and China from 1949 to 1979 meant that Singaporean Mandarin had to invent its own new words to suit the local Singapore environment, as well as borrow certain words from Taiwanese Mandarin or some other Chinese dialects that were spoken in Singapore. As a result, new Mandarin words proprietary to Singapore were invented.\n\nThe \"Dictionary of Contemporary Singaporean Mandarin Vocabulary\" () edited by Wang Huidi () listed 1560 uniquely local Singaporean Mandarin words, which are not used in Mainland China or Taiwan.\n\nThere are many new terms that are specific to living in Singapore (though some also apply in neighbouring Malaysia). These words were either translated from Malay and Chinese dialects (or invented) as there were no equivalent words in Putonghua. Some of the words are taken from the Hokkien translation of Malay words. Words translated from Malay into Hokkien include \"kampung\", \"pasar\" (, English 'market'). This explains the uniquely Singapore Mandarin words.\nThere are some words used in Singaporean Mandarin that have the same meaning with other words used in Putonghua or Taiwanese Mandarin:\n\nThere are certain similar words used in both Singaporean Mandarin and Putonghua, but have different meanings and usage.\n\nThere is quite a number of specific words used in Singaporean Mandarin that originate from other Chinese dialects such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese etc. These dialects have also influenced the pronunciation in Singaporean Mandarin.\n\nThere is quite a number of specific words used in Singaporean Mandarin that originate or are transliterated from English. These words appear in written Singaporean Mandarin.\n\nIn terms of standard written Mandarin in Singapore, the Singaporean Mandarin grammar is almost similar to that of Putonghua. However, the grammar of colloquial Singaporean Mandarin can differ from that of Putonghua as a result of influence from other varieties of Chinese, classical Chinese and English. Some of the local Singaporean Mandarin writings do exhibit certain local Singaporean features.\n\nWhen speaking of minutes, colloquial Singaporean Mandarin typically uses the word 字 (\"zì\"), which represents a unit of 5 minutes. When referring to a number of hours (duration), 钟头 (\"zhōngtóu\") is used instead of 小时 (\"xiǎoshí\"). For instance:\n\nThe use of \"zì\" (字) originates from Hokkien (\"jī\" or \"lī\"), Cantonese or Classical Chinese. Its origin came from the ancient Chinese units of measuring time. In ancient Chinese time measurement, hours were measured in terms of \"shíchén\" (时辰), equivalent to 2 hours while minutes were measured in terms of \"kè\" (刻), equivalent to 15 minutes. Each \"kè\" was in turn divided into 3 \"zì\" (equivalent to 5 minutes). For instance, 7:45 pm is:\n\nAs a result of Hokkien influence, colloquial Singaporean Mandarin typically uses the word \"拜-\" (\"bài\") to refer to the days of the week, in lieu of Standard Mandarin \"星期-\" (\"xīngqí-\"). For instance:\n\nBoth 拜 (\"bài\") and 礼拜 (\"lǐbài\") originate from Hokkien \"pài\" and \"lé-pài\" respectively.\n\nIn colloquial Singaporean Mandarin, 万 (\"wàn\"), referring to a \"ten thousand\" is often used but 十千 (\"shí qiān\"), referring to \"ten thousands\" is occasionally used too. This usage was influenced by English numbering system.\n\n而已 (\"éryǐ\") is more common in colloquial Singaporean Mandarin than in Standard Mandarin, which uses 罢了 (\"bàle\"). The same is true for Taiwanese Mandarin. While 而已 (\"éryǐ\") is also used in colloquial Mandarin within Mainland China, but perhaps to a lesser extent as compared to Singapore or Taiwan. For example:\n\nTranslation: \"only like this / only this kind!\"\n\nWhen people describe the size of animals, for example, chicken, these are used to mean 'small' 'large'. Putonghua tends to use \"肥\"\"瘦\" instead. These two words are also used to describe the 'size' your body frame. \"大只\" refers to people who appear to be tall, masculine or a large body build. \"小只\" is used to describe people with a small built, tiny frame. \n\nIn colloquial Singaporean Mandarin, the word \"啊\" is often used in response to a sentence as an affirmative. It is often pronounced as (with a nasal tone) instead of 'ah' or 'a' (in Putonghua). Putonghua tends to use \"是(的)/对啊/对呀\" (\"shì (de)/duì a/duì ya\")， \"哦\" (\"ó\"), \"噢\" (\"ō\"), \"嗯\" (en/ng) to mean \"yes, it is\".\n\nIn Singaporean Mandarin, there is a greater tendency to use the word \"cái\" \"才\" (then) in lieu of Standard Mandarin zài \"再\" (then), which indicates a future action after the completion of a prior action. For instance:\n\nIn Standard Mandarin, one typical way of turning certain nouns into adjectives, such as 兴趣 (\"xìngqù\", 'interest'), 营养 (\"yíngyǎng\", 'nutrition'), 礼貌 (\"lǐmào\", 'politeness'), is to prefix the word \"有\" (\"yǒu\") at the front of these nouns.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe word 有 (\"yǒu\") is sometimes omitted in writing.\n\nIn Singaporean Mandarin, verbs preceding \"一下\" may be reduplicated, unlike in Putonghua. In Putonghua grammar, the use of the word \"一下(儿)\" (\"yīxià(r)\") is often put at the back of a verb to indicate that the action (as indicated by the verb) is momentary.\n\nFor example:\n\nSingaporean colloquial Mandarin tends to use 被 (\"bèi\") more commonly than Putonghua, mainly due to influence from English.\n\nCompare the following:\n\nSometimes, colloquial Singaporean Mandarin might use intransitive verbs as transitive.\n\nFor instance\n\n\"进步\" (improve) is an intransitive verb. But as influenced by the use of English, \"I want to improve my Chinese\" is sometimes said in Singaporean Mandarin as \"我要进步我的华语\". The standard Mandarin should be \"我要让我的华语进步\"\n\nThe phonology and tones of Singaporean Mandarin are generally similar to that of Standard Mandarin. There are 4 tones similar to those in Standard Mandarin, but Erhua (\"-er\" finals) and the neutral tone (轻声, lit. 'light tone') are generally absent in Singaporean Mandarin.\n\nThe earliest development of Singaporean Mandarin includes the old Beijing phonology (老国音), followed by new Beijing phonology (新国音) and then finally Hanyu Pinyin of mainland China. In its initial development, Singaporean Mandarin was highly influenced by the Ru sheng 入声 (checked tones or \"5th tones\") from other Chinese varieties. As such, the 5th tone did appear in earlier Singaporean Mandarin. The characteristics of the 5th tone are as follows:\n\n\nHowever, due to years of development, prevalence of the 5th tone in Singaporean Mandarin is declining. This means that the Singaporean Mandarin had inclined itself towards Standard Chinese.\n\nMinor differences occur between the phonology (tones) of Standard Singaporean Mandarin and other forms of Standard Mandarin.\n\nJust like any languages in Singapore, Singaporean Mandarin is subjected to influences from other languages spoken in Singapore.\n\nSingaporean Hokkien is the largest non-Mandarin Chinese variety spoken in Singapore. The natural tendency of Hokkien-speakers to use the Hokkien way to speak Mandarin has influenced to a large degree the colloquial Mandarin spoken in Singapore. The colloquial Hokkien-style Singaporean Mandarin is commonly heard in Singapore, and can differ from Putonghua in terms of vocabulary, phonology and grammar.\n\nBesides Singaporean Hokkien, Mandarin is also subjected to influence coming from other dialects such as Teochew, Cantonese, Hakka, and Hainanese, as well as English.\n\nIn Singapore, simplified Chinese characters are the official standard used in all official publications as well as the government-controlled press. While simplified Chinese characters are taught exclusively in schools, the government does not officially discourage the use of traditional characters. Therefore, many shop signs continue to be written in traditional characters. Menus in hawker centres and coffeeshops are also usually written in simplified characters.\n\nAs there is no restriction on the use of traditional characters in the mass media, television programmes, books, magazines and music CDs that have been imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan are widely available, and these almost always use traditional characters. Most karaoke discs, being imported from Hong Kong or Taiwan, have song lyrics in traditional characters as well. While all official publications are in simplified characters, the government still allows parents to choose whether to have their child's Chinese name registered in simplified or traditional characters though most choose the former.\n\nSingapore had undergone three successive rounds of character simplification, eventually arriving at the same set of simplified characters as mainland China. Before 1969, Singapore generally used traditional characters. From 1969 to 1976, the Ministry of education launched its own version of simplified characters, which differed from that of mainland China. But after 1976, Singapore fully adopted the simplified characters of mainland China.\n\nBefore the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Singapore Chinese writings were based on Classical Chinese. After the May Fourth Movement, under the influence from the New Culture Movement in China, the Chinese schools in Singapore began to follow the new education reform as advocated by China's reformist and changed the writing style to Vernacular Chinese.\n\nSingapore's Chinese newspaper had witnessed this change from Classical Chinese to Vernacular Chinese. Lat Pau (叻報), one of the earliest Chinese newspaper, was still using Classical Chinese in 1890. By 1917, it continued to use Classical Chinese. But by 1925, it had changed to Vernacular Chinese. After this, all Chinese newspaper in Singapore used Vernacular Chinese.\n\nSingaporean Chinese literature was once part of Malaysia Chinese literature. It originated from the New Culture Movement in China. In 1965, Singapore was expelled from Malaysia. Since then, Singaporean Chinese literature started to develop independently.\n\nThe development of the Singaporean Chinese literature reflected the history of immigrants in Singapore. When many Chinese writers from Southern China arrived in Singapore, they established Chinese schools, newspaper press etc. They contributed a lot to the development of Chinese literature in Singapore. In 1919, the \"New National Magazine\" 《新國民雜誌》 marked the birth of Malaysia Chinese literature. In those days, the migrant's mindset was still deeply entrenched. Many of the literary works were influenced by New Culture Movement. Most of the literary works that were published originated from the works of writers in China.\n\nIn 1925, the presence of literary supplements such as \"\"Southern Wind\" 《南風》, \"Light of Singapore\" 《星光》\" brought a new dimension to Malaysia Chinese literature. They differed from past magazine that relied on writers from China. It was at this time, that the thoughts of Nanyang began to surface the corner. In January 1927, the \"Deserted Island\" 《荒島》 published in the \"New National Press\" 《新國民日報》 clearly reflected the features of Nanyang in its literary work. The \"localization\" literary works mostly described the lifestyle in Nanyang, the people and their feelings in Nayang. The quality of Singaporean Chinese literature had greatly improved.\n\nIn 1937, the outbreak of Second Sino-Japanese War raised the anti-Japanese sentiment. The literature during these times reflected the missions of national salvation against the Japanese. This brought a halt to the localization movement and in turn re-enacted a sense of Chinese nationalism amongst the migrants in Singapore. From 1941 till 1945, during the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the activities for Malaysia Chinese literature was halted.\n\nAfter the war, people in Singapore began to have a sense of belonging to this piece of land, and they also had a desire for freedom and democracy. During this times, Malaysia Chinese literature was inclined towards Anti-colonialism. With new arts and thoughts, between 1947 - 1948, there was a debate between \"Unique Malaysian Literary Art\" and \"literary thoughts of migrants\". The results from these debated led to a conclusion that the Malaysia Chinese literature was going to develop on its own independently. The \"localization\" clearly marked the mature development of Malaysia Chinese literature.\n\nDuring the 1950s, writers from Malaysia and Singapore drew their literary works mostly from the local lifestyle and events that reflected the lifestyle from all areas of the society. They also included many Chinese-dialect proverbs in their works. They created unique works of literature. Writers including Miao Xiu (), Yao Zhi (), Zhao Rong (), Shu Shu () etc. represented the writers of \"localization\" works.\n\nOn 9 August 1965, Singapore became independent. Malaysia Chinese literature was now divided into Malaysian Chinese literature and Singaporean Chinese literature.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1970, the number of literary works published began to increase. Locally-born and locally bred Singaporean writers became the new writers in the stage of Singaporean Chinese literature. Their works were mainly based on the views of Singaporeans towards issues or context happening in Singapore. They continued the \"localization\" movement and brought the Singaporean Chinese literature to a new dimension.\n\nAfter the Speak Mandarin Campaign in 1979, all Chinese TV programs using other Chinese varieties were replaced by Mandarin programs. Singapore also started to broadcast Mandopop. The birth of Xinyao during the 1980s injected a new life to the creation of lyrics for Mandopop in Singapore. Singapore radios also began to have Singapore Billboards () for Mandopop. This allowed Singapore to be developed into a major center for Mandopop in South East Asia. There were also many Mandopop artist coming from Singapore such as Stefanie Sun, JJ Lin, Tanya Chua, etc.\n\nAt the moment, there are 2 television channels with news bulletin programmes in Chinese.\n\nLanguage plays an important role in Singapore politics. Up to today, it is still important for politicians in Singapore to be able to speak their mother tongue (and even other dialects) fluently in order to reach out to the multilingual community in Singapore.\n\nAccording to observation, if an election candidate is able to speak fluent Mandarin, his chance of winning an election is higher during the election campaign. As such, most election candidates will try to use Mandarin in campaign speeches in order to attract Mandarin-speaking voters.\n\nSome Chinese elites in Singapore had criticized that the Mandarin standard of Chinese Singaporean has dropped greatly due to the closure or subsequent conversion of Chinese-medium schools to English-medium schools in the 1980s. Others attributed the drop in standard to the lack of learning Chinese literature in schools.\n\nEver since 1965 when Singapore became independent, bilingual policy has become the pillar of Singapore's education. The first language of Singapore was English, while Mandarin was chosen as the \"mother tongue\" of Chinese Singaporean. Generally, most Chinese Singaporean can speak Mandarin fluently, but are usually weaker in writing Chinese.\n\nIn recent years, with the subsequent economic rise of mainland China and a transition from a world factory to a world market, Mandarin has become the 2nd most influential language after English. Besides transmitting Chinese culture values, many people began to realize the economic values of Mandarin, which has raised the interests of local and working professionals in learning Mandarin.\n\nThe original mother tongue of Chinese Singaporeans other Chinese varieties, such as Hokkien, Teochew or Cantonese. This was certainly true when southern Chinese migrants came to Singapore. However, with the Speak Mandarin campaign, the Chinese Singaporean's home language experienced a change from these other varieties to Mandarin, and later from Mandarin to English. Mandarin was designated as the mother tongue of Chinese Singaporean in Singapore.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of dialect preservation, due to the great decline in the use of other Chinese dialects in Singapore. Most young Chinese Singaporeans were unable to speak these Chinese dialects effectively and were thus unable to communicate with their grandparents, who are more used to speaking these dialects. This has caused a generation gap. As such, there is a minority of Singaporeans working to help preserve or spread these Chinese dialects in Singapore.\n\nUnder the bilingual policy of Singapore, Chinese Singaporeans had a greater chance to speak and use English especially in school and at work. But this can cause a relative limitation in the use of mother tongue. Generally speaking, most Chinese Singaporeans are able to speak Mandarin, and also read newspapers in it, but only a minority is able to use it at a professional level such as academic research, literary writing etc. In the endeavor to use English, some Chinese Singaporeans even distanced themselves from the mother tongue culture, resulting in the erosion of Chinese culture in Singapore.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "546350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=546350", "title": "Stadsfries dialects", "text": "Stadsfries dialects\n\nStadsfries, Stadfries, Stedfrysk or Town Frisian is a set of dialects spoken in certain cities in the province of Friesland in the northern Netherlands, namely Leeuwarden, Sneek, Bolsward, Franeker, Dokkum, Harlingen, Stavoren, and to some extent in Heerenveen. For linguistic reasons, the outlying and insular dialects of Midsland (Terschelling), Ameland, Het Bildt, and Kollum are also sometimes tied to Stadsfries.\n\nThe vocabulary of Stadsfries is derived primarily from Dutch. The dialects began in the late 15th century, when Frisia lost its political independence to the Netherlands. For many living in Frisia, learning Dutch became a necessity. The result was a mixture of Hollandic dialect vocabulary and West Frisian grammar and other language principles. Since this process began, the West Frisian language itself has evolved, such that Stadsfries is further away from modern Frisian than it is from Old Frisian. Norval Smith states that Stadsfries is a Frisian–Dutch mixed language.\n\nThe name of the dialect group, \"Stadsfries\", is not an endonym but is instead the Dutch term for the language. \"Stad\" (German: Stadt) is a Germanic term for \"city\" or \"town\", seen in English place names such as \"Hempstead\". In Stadsfries, the term for the dialect group is \"Stadsfrys\" or \"Stads\", or each dialect is known simply by a name derived from the particular city name, such as \"Liwwarders\" for the dialect of Leeuwarden. In West Frisian, the dialects are known as \"Stedsk\" (\"city-ish\"), which does not indicate the idea that Stadsfries is a form of Frisian. To indicate this difference, one can call (West) Frisian-proper \"Boerenfries\" (\"farmer-Frisian\").\n\nThe vocabulary of Stadsfries is mainly Dutch though the West Frisian language influence is notable. Furthermore, a set of word forms are used that are clearly West Frisian, not Dutch.\nExamples:\nThe language also has typical West Frisian words that don't exist (in that sense) in Dutch, usually this concerns domestic words and words from the mainly West Frisian language agricultural sector.\nExamples:\nOther differences between Dutch and West Frisian can be traced back to the Dutch dialect of the 16th century.\nExample:\n\nFinally, several words have survived in the Stadsfries language due to Dutch influence that have since disappeared from the West Frisian language.\nExamples:\n\nStadsfries phonology deviates from Dutch in the absence of the voiced sounds /v/ and /z/ at the beginning of words. Dutch words like this often have an equivalent Stadsfrisian translation that instead starts with the unvoiced sounds /f/ and /s/. The Dutch sounds sequence /sx/ does not exist in Stadsfries, but is often replaced with /sk/. Stadsfries has these properties in common with West Frisian, as well as several Dutch dialects.\n\nThe plurals match West Frisian \"(skip-skippen)\", as do the diminutives \"(popke, autootsje, rinkje)\", except those in Stavers \"(poppy, autootsy, rinkje)\", where Hollands rules are followed.\n\nThe verbs are missing two West Frisian weak classes, but do use West Frisian rules for forming past participles: they never get the affix \"ge- (ik hew maakt; hest dou dat sien?)\". Stadsfrisian kept the West Frisian pronouns \"do, jo and jimme\" (informal you, formal you, plural you), although \"do\" and \"jo\" are almost always written as \"dou\" and \"jou. \" These words can in fact be used as criteria for deciding whether a Hollandic-West Frisian mixed dialect can still be considered Stadsfries. The Dutch dialect called \"West Frisian\" spoken in the West Friesland region of North Holland for example does not have these words and is therefore considered Hollandic.\n\nThere is no standardized, officially recognized spelling for Stadsfries. The very few authors that write in it each use their own spelling conventions. The most commonly used spelling is that in the \"Woordenboek fan ut Liwwarders\" (Leeuwarden Dictionary). This spelling convention is closely related to, but more phonetic than West Frisian, and does not use the letter \"û\".\n\nThe use of Stadsfries is declining rapidly, especially in Leeuwarden. No more than a quarter of the city's population (approximately 20,000 people) speaks the language, although that percentage is higher in smaller towns. In the first half of the twentieth century the town of Heerenveen had a local strand of Stadsfries known as Haagjes Fries, spoken especially around Oranjewoud, near the country home of the Frisian stadhouder.\n\nUse of most dialects (as well as the West Frisian language) is declining, but because West Frisian is considered prestigious and even recognized as a Dutch national language, Stadsfries has become a sociolect of the lower classes, especially in the cities. The transition from dialect to sociolect happened primarily in the 20th century. Around 1900, the Stadsfries dialects were still considered regional strands of Dutch and given a much higher status than Frisian. With the rise of Standard Dutch in society's upper classes, brought on particularly by education and mass media, Stadsfries stopped being considered a strand of Dutch. Since the lower classes had less exposure to Standard Dutch, they remained as some of the only speakers of Stadsfries.\n\n"}
{"id": "1864451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864451", "title": "Supermax prison", "text": "Supermax prison\n\nSuper-maximum security (supermax) or administrative maximum (ADX) is a term used to describe \"control-unit\" prisons, or units within prisons, which represent the most secure levels of custody in the prison systems of certain countries. The term is used in the United States and a number of other countries to describe the most secure form of security within a certain prison system. The objective is to provide long-term, segregated housing for inmates classified as the highest security risks in the prison system—the \"worst of the worst\" criminals—and those who pose an extremely serious threat to both national and global security.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Corrections, an agency of the United States government; \"a supermax is a stand-alone unit or part of another facility and is designated for violent or disruptive inmates. It typically involves up to 23-hour-per-day, single-cell confinement for an indefinite period of time. Inmates in supermax housing have minimal contact with staff and other inmates,\" a definition confirmed by a majority of prison wardens.\n\nLeena Kurki and Norval Morris have argued there is no absolute definition of a supermax, and that different jurisdictions classify prisons as supermax inconsistently. They identify four general features that tend to characterize supermax prisons:\n\n\nIn supermax, prisoners are generally allowed out of their cells for only one hour a day (one-and-a-half hours in California state prisons); often they are kept in solitary confinement. They receive their meals through ports in the doors of their cells. When supermax inmates are allowed to exercise, this may take place in a small, enclosed area where the prisoner will exercise alone.\n\nPrisoners are under constant surveillance, usually with closed-circuit television cameras. Cell doors are usually opaque, while the cells may be windowless. Conditions are plain, with poured concrete or metal furniture common. Cell walls, and sometimes plumbing, may be soundproofed to prevent communication between the inmates.\n\nThe term \"supermax\" was adopted in the US and has since been adopted in a number of other countries. The United States Penitentiary Alcatraz Island, opened in 1934, has been considered a prototype and early standard for a supermax prison.\n\nAn early form of supermax-style prison unit appeared in Australia in 1975, when \"Katingal\" was built inside the Long Bay Correctional Centre in Sydney. Dubbed the \"electronic zoo\" by inmates, Katingal was a super-maximum security prison block with 40 prison cells having electronically operated doors, surveillance cameras, and no windows. It was closed down two years later over human rights concerns. Since then, some maximum-security prisons have gone to full lockdown as well, while others have been built and dedicated to the supermax standard.\n\nSupermax prisons began to proliferate within the United States after 1984. Prior to 1984 only one prison in the U.S. met \"supermax\" standards: the Federal Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois. By 1999, the United States contained at least 57 supermax facilities, spread across 30–34 states. The push for this type of prison came after two correctional officers at Marion, Merle Clutts and Robert Hoffman, were stabbed to death in two separate incidents by inmates Thomas Silverstein and Clayton Fountain. This prompted Norman Carlson, director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, to call for a new type of prison to isolate uncontrollable inmates. In Carlson's view, such a prison was the only way to deal with inmates who \"show absolutely no concern for human life\".\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons' solitary confinement units are known as Special Housing Units (SHU).\n\nIn recent years a number of U.S. states have downgraded their supermax prisons, as has been done with Wallens Ridge State Prison, a former supermax prison in Big Stone Gap, Virginia. Other supermax prisons that have gained notoriety for their harsh conditions and attendant litigation by inmates and advocates are the former Boscobel (in Wisconsin), now named the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility, Red Onion State Prison (in western Virginia, the twin to Wallens Ridge State Prison), Tamms (in Illinois), and the Ohio State Penitentiary. Placement policies at the Ohio facility were the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court case (\"Wilkinson v. Austin\") in 2005 where the Court decided that there had to be some, but only very limited, due process involved in supermax placement.\n\nThere is only one supermax prison in the United States federal system, ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado. It houses several inmates who have a history of violent behavior in other prisons, with the goal of moving them from solitary confinement for 23 hours a day to a less restrictive prison within three years. However, it is best known for housing several inmates who have been deemed either too dangerous, too high-profile or too great a national security risk for even a maximum-security prison. Residents have included Timothy McVeigh, perpetrator of the Oklahoma City Bombing who was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute on June 11, 2001; Theodore Kaczynski, a domestic terrorist otherwise known as the Unabomber, who once attacked via mail bombs; Robert Hanssen, an American FBI agent turned Soviet spy; Terry Nichols, McVeigh's accomplice in the Oklahoma City Bombing; Richard Reid, known as the \"Shoe Bomber\", who was jailed for life for attempting to detonate explosive materials in his shoes while on board an aircraft; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the underwear bomber; Richard Lee McNair, a persistent prison escapee; Charles Harrelson, a hitman who was convicted in 1979 of killing Federal Judge John H. Wood Jr.; and Vito Rizzuto, boss of the \"Sixth\" Mafia \"Family,\" released on October 5, 2012. The Boston Marathon Bomber was housed there. Deprivation of social contact and the isolation of inmates has some unintended positive and negative effects. Inmates are safer being in isolation, and prisons create more jobs for their local communities. Supermax prisons however are extremely expensive to run and can cost about three times the national average for a maximum security facility.\n\nHowever, many states now have created supermax prisons, either as stand-alone facilities or as secure units within lower-security prisons. State supermax prisons include Pelican Bay in California and Tamms in Illinois. The USP in Marion, Illinois was recently downgraded to a medium-security facility. Some facilities such as California State Prison, Corcoran (COR) are hybrids incorporating a supermax partition, housing or having housed high security prisoners such as Charles Manson.\n\nIn September 2001, the Australian state of New South Wales opened a facility in the Goulburn Correctional Centre to the supermax standard. While its condition is an improvement over that of Katingal of the 1970s, this new facility is nonetheless designed on the same principle of sensory deprivation. It has been set up for 'AA' prisoners who are deemed a risk to public safety and the instruments of government and civil order, or believed to be beyond rehabilitation. Corrections Victoria in the state of Victoria also operates the Acacia and Maleuca units at Barwon Prison which serve to hold the prisoners requiring the highest security in that state including Melbourne Gangland figures such as Tony Mokbel and Carl Williams, who was murdered in the Acacia unit in 2010.\n\nSupermax and Security Housing Unit (SHU) prisons are controversial. One criticism is that the living conditions in such facilities violate the United States Constitution, specifically, the Eighth Amendment's proscription against \"cruel and unusual\" punishments. In 1996, a United Nations team assigned to investigate torture described SHU conditions as \"inhuman and degrading\". A 2011 New York Bar association comprehensive study suggested that supermax prisons constitute \"torture under international law\" and \"cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution\". In 2012, a federal class action suit against the Federal Bureau of Prisons and officials who run ADX Florence SHU (\"Bacote v. Federal Bureau of Prisons\", Civil Action 1:12-cv-01570) alleged chronic abuse, failure to properly diagnose prisoners, and neglect of prisoners who are seriously mentally ill. The suit was dismissed.\n\n Most of these facilities only contain supermax wings or sections, with other parts of the facility under lesser security measures.\n\n\n\n\nIn Brazil, the \"regime disciplinar diferenciado\" (differentiated disciplinary regime), known by the acronym RDD, and strongly based on the Supermax standard, was created primarily to handle inmates who are considered capable of continuing to run their crime syndicate or to order criminal actions from within the prison system, when confined in normal maximum security prisons that allow contact with other inmates. Since its inception, the following prisons were prepared for the housing of RDD inmates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Maximum Insecurity,\" an Amazon bestseller, gives an inside look at the medical system at the Colorado State Penitentiary.\n\nIn the Season 2 Finale of \"Arrow\", Oliver places Slade Wilson in an unnamed supermax facility designed by A.R.G.U.S., simply referred to as The Supermax in marketing materials.\n\nThe movie \"Escape Plan\" starring Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jim Caviezel is based on an ocean-based \"supermax facility\"\n\nIn the Season 6 Finale of \"Arrow\", Samandra Watson places Oliver in the unnamed maximun security state penitentiary that is referred to as Slapside, which is an unofficial nickname for the prison used by both law enforcement and inmates within the show.\n\n\n"}

K. Ogden and I. A. Richards. It is accompanied by two supplementary essays by Bronisław Malinowski and F. G. Crookshank. \n\nAlthough the original text was published in 1923 it has been used as a textbook in many fields including linguistics, philosophy, language, cognitive science and most recently semantics and semiotics in general. The book has been in print continuously since 1923. The most recent edition is the critical edition prepared by W. Terrence Gordon as volume 3 of the 5-volume set \"C. K. Ogden & Linguistics\" (London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press, 1995). The full publication history, including serialised publication in \"The Cambridge Magazine\" prior to the first edition of the book, is in W. Terrence Gordon's, \"C. K. Ogden: a bio-bibliographical study\" (Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1990).\n\nRichards sets forth a contextual theory of Signs: that Words and Things are connected “through their occurrence together with things, their linkage with them in a ‘context’ that Symbols come to play that important part in our life [even] the source of all our power over the external world” (47). In this context system, Richards develops a tri-part semiotics—symbol, thought and referent with three relations between them (thought to symbol=correct, thought–referent=adequate, symbol–reference=true) (11). Symbols are “those signs which men use to communicate one with another and as instruments of thought, occupy a peculiar place” (23). “All discursive symbolization involves […] weaving together of contexts into higher contexts” (220). So for a word to be understood “requires that it form a context with further experiences” (210).\n\nThe book would later influence A. J. Ayer's \"Language, Truth, and Logic\", an introduction to logical positivism, and both the Richards–Ogden book and the Ayer book would, in turn, influence Alec King and Martin Ketley in the writing of their book \"The Control of Language\", which appeared in 1939, and which influenced C. S. Lewis in the writing of his defence of natural law and objective values, \"The Abolition of Man\" (1943).\n\n"}

Because the Vietnamese alphabet contains a complex system of diacritical marks, VIQR requires the user to type in a base letter, followed by one or two characters that represent the diacritical marks.\n\nVIQR uses the following convention:\n\nVIQR uses codice_1 or codice_2 for the Vietnamese letter \"Đ\", and codice_3 for the Vietnamese letter \"đ\". To type certain punctuation marks (namely, the period, question mark, apostrophe, forward slash, opening parenthesis, or tilde) directly after most Vietnamese words, a backslash (codice_4) must be typed directly before the punctuation mark, functioning as an escape character, so that it will not be interpreted as a diacritical mark. For example:\n\nVIQR is primarily used as a Vietnamese input method in software that supports Unicode. Similar input methods include Telex and VNI. Input method editors such as VPSKeys convert VIQR sequences to Unicode precomposed characters as one types, typically allowing modifier keys to be input after all the base letters of each word. However, in the absence of input method software or Unicode support, VIQR can still be input using a standard keyboard and read as plain ASCII text without suffering from \"mojibake\".\n\nUnlike the VISCII and VPS code pages, VIQR is rarely used as a character encoding. While VIQR is registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority as a MIME \"charset\", MIME-compliant software is not required to support it. Nevertheless, the Mozilla Vietnamese Enabling Project once produced builds of the open source version of Netscape Communicator, as well as its successor, the Mozilla Application Suite, that were capable of decoding VIQR-encoded webpages, e-mails, and newsgroup messages. In these unofficial builds, a \"VIQR\" option appears in the Edit | Character Set menu, alongside the VISCII, TCVN 5712, VPS, and Windows-1258 options that remained available for several years in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird.\n\nBy the early 1990s, an ad-hoc system of mnemonics known as Vietnet was in use on the Viet-Net mailing list and soc.culture.vietnamese Usenet group.\n\nIn 1992, the Vietnamese Standardization Group (Viet-Std, \"Nhóm Nghiên Cứu Tiêu Chuẩn Tiếng Việt\") from the TriChlor Software Group in California formalized the VIQR convention. It was described the next year in RFC 1456.\n\n\nAlternative schemes for Vietnamese:\n\nASCII mnemonics for other writing systems:\n\n"}

The crónica is a journalistic form common in Iberia and Latin America and which was widely cultivated in Portuguese Goa. It can be roughly defined as a literary text combining elements of the short story, the memoir and the opinion editorial. Born in Arossim, Antão contributed several hundred such articles to \"O Heraldo\" and \"Diário da Noite\" from the late 1950s until the demise or Anglicisation of these papers.\n\nAntão's \"crónicas\" reflect his preoccupations with environmental concerns, Goan culture, the future of the Portuguese language in the territory, and issues related to Alcoholics Anonymous, of which he was one of the first promoters in Goa \n\nAntão's stories, like the rest of his journalistic output, seem influenced by what we could loosely term existentialist concerns, such as alienation, freedom, absurdity, authenticity and self-determination. Indeed, anecdote holds that Antão was an acquaintance of Sartre's in Paris at the height of existentialism's influence and prestige. Yet Antão's treatment of existential themes is always mediated by his engagement with Goan actuality, his concerns about the dissolution of Goan identity and the destruction of the Goan landscape. Earlier, before the environment became an issue, he allowed his brother-in-law to extract sand from the dunes on his ancestral property - that was later sold to Park Hyatt Resort, Arossim. The extent to which the author himself was touched by existential despair, which here could be conceptualized as a loss of hope concerning the signification and transformation of life, is open to debate. His texts certainly seem delicately balanced between positive and negative elements.\n\n"}
