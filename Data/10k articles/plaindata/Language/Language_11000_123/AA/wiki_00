The Hani languages are, in turn, classified in the Hanoish branch of Loloish. Alternatively, Chinese linguists consider all Hani languages, including Akha, to be dialects of a single language in accordance with China's official classification of ethnic groups, which groups all speakers of Hani languages into one ethnicity.\n\nSpeakers of Akha live in remote mountainous areas where it has developed into a wide-ranging dialect continuum. Dialects from villages separated by as little as ten kilometers may show marked differences. The isolated nature of Akha communities has also resulted in several villages with divergent dialects. Dialects from extreme ends of the continuum and the more divergent dialects are mutually unintelligible.\n\nThe Akha dialect spoken in Alu village, 55 kilometers northwest of Chiang Rai city in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand is described below. Katsura conducted his study in during the late 1960s. With a population of 400 it was, at the time, one of the largest Akha villages in Northern Thailand and was still growing as a result of cross-border migration from Burma. The Akha in Alu spoke no Standard Thai and communicated with outsiders using either Lahu Na or Shan.\n\nThe Alu dialect has 23 or 24 consonants depending on how the syllabic nasal is analyzed. The , realized variously as or , can be analyzed as a separate single consonant or as sequences of /ʔm/ and /hm/. Katsura chose the latter but listed the /m/ component of the syllabic consonant with the vowels.\nAkha is often described as glottal \"tension\" rather than a true stop\n\nAny consonant may begin a syllable, but native Akha syllables which don't end in a vowel may only end in either -m or -ɔŋ. A few loan words have been noted that end in -aŋ or -aj. In the case of a nasal coda, some vowels become nasalized. Alu Akha distinguishes ten vowel qualities, contrasting rounded and unrounded back vowels at three heights while only the mid front vowels contrast roundness.\n\nThree vowels, , and , show marked nasalization when followed by a nasal consonant becoming , and , respectively.\n\nThe table below lists the Akha varieties surveyed in Kingsada (1999), Shintani (2001), and Kato (2008), with autonyms and informant birth places given as well. All locations are in Phongsaly Province, northern Laos.\n\nAkha Chicho, spoken in Ban Pasang village, Muang Sing district, Luang Namtha Province, is documented in Hayashi (2018). Hayashi (2018: 8) reports that Akha Chicho is mutually intelligible with Akha Buli.\n\nIn Jinghong City and Menghai County, the two major Hani subgroups are Jiuwei 鸠为 and Jizuo 吉坐. The Jizuo 吉坐 are the largest Hani ethnic subgroup in Jinghong.\n\nThe Jiuwei claim to have migrated from Honghe and Mojiang. The Jiuwei live in various villages in Jinghong, including:\n\nThere are also ethnic Hani that are locally called Aini 爱尼 living in 7 villages on Nanlin Mountain 南林山 of southwestern Jinghong, namely Manbage 曼八阁, Manjinglong 曼景龙, Manjingnan 曼景囡, Mangudu 曼固独, Manbaqi 曼把奇, Manbasan 曼巴伞, and Manjingmai 曼景卖.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "168041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168041", "title": "Anatomical terms of location", "text": "Anatomical terms of location\n\nStandard anatomical terms of location deal unambiguously with the anatomy of animals, including humans.\n\nAll vertebrates (including humans) have the same basic body plan they are strictly bilaterally symmetrical in early embryonic stages and largely bilaterally symmetrical in adulthood. That is, they have mirror-image left and right halves if divided down the middle. For these reasons, the basic directional terms can be considered to be those used in vertebrates. By extension, the same terms are used for many other (invertebrate) organisms as well.\n\nWhile these terms are standardized within specific fields of biology, there are unavoidable, sometimes dramatic, differences between some disciplines. For example, differences in terminology remain a problem that, to some extent, still separates the terminology of human anatomy from that used in the study of various other zoological categories.\n\nStandardized anatomical and zoological terms of location have been developed, usually based on Latin and Greek words, to enable all biological and medical scientists to precisely delineate and communicate information about animal bodies and their component organs, even though the meaning of some of the terms often is context-sensitive.\n\nThe vertebrates and \"Craniata\" share a substantial heritage and common structure, so many of the same terms are used for location. To avoid ambiguities this terminology is based on the anatomy of each animal in a standard way.\n\nFor humans, one type of vertebrate, anatomical terms may differ from other forms of vertebrates. For one reason, this is because humans have a different neuraxis and, unlike animals that rest on four limbs, humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the standard anatomical position. Thus what is on \"top\" of a human is the head, whereas the \"top\" of a dog may be its back, and the \"top\" of a flounder could refer to either its left or its right side.\n\nFor invertebrates, standard application of locational terminology often becomes difficult or debatable at best when the differences in morphology are so radical that common concepts are not homologous and do not refer to common concepts. For example, many species are not even bilaterally symmetrical. In these species, terminology depends on their type of symmetry (if any).\n\nBecause animals can change orientation with respect to their environment, and because appendages like limbs and tentacles can change position with respect to the main body, positional descriptive terms need to refer to the animal as in its standard anatomical position. All descriptions are with respect to the organism in its standard anatomical position, even when the organism in question has appendages in another position. This helps avoid confusion in terminology when referring to the same organism in different postures.\n\nIn humans, this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward (thumbs out). While the universal vertebrate terminology used in veterinary medicine would work in human medicine, the human terms are thought to be too well established to be worth changing.\n\nMany anatomical terms can be combined, either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body. For example, \"anterolateral\" indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis (such as the bulk of the pectoralis major muscle). In radiology, an X-ray image may be said to be \"anteroposterior\", indicating that the beam of X-rays pass from their source to patient's anterior body wall through the body to exit through posterior body wall.\n\nThere is no definite limit to the contexts in which terms may be modified to qualify each other in such combinations. Generally the modifier term is truncated and an \"o\" or an \"i\" is added in prefixing it to the qualified term. For example, a view of an animal from an aspect at once dorsal and lateral might be called a \"dorsolateral\" view; and the effect of dorsolateral flattening in an organism such as a krait gives its body a triangular cross section. Again, in describing the morphology of an organ or habitus of an animal such as many of the Platyhelminthes, one might speak of it as \"dorsiventrally\" flattened as opposed to bilaterally flattened animals such as ocean sunfish.\n\nWhere desirable three or more terms may be agglutinated or concatenated, as in \"anteriodorsolateral\". Such terms sometimes used to be hyphenated, but the modern tendency is to omit the hyphen. There is however little basis for any strict rule to interfere with choice of convenience in such usage.\n\nThree basic reference planes are used to describe location.\n\n\nIn human anatomy:\n\nTo begin with, distinct, polar-opposite ends of the organism are chosen. By definition, each pair of opposite points defines an axis. In a bilaterally symmetrical organism, there are 6 polar opposite points, giving three axes that intersect at right angles the x, y, and z axes familiar from three-dimensional geometry.\n\nThe terms \"intermediate\", \"ipsilateral\", \"contralateral\", \"superficial\", and \"deep\", while indicating directions, are relative terms and thus do not properly define fixed anatomical axes. Also, while the \"rostrocaudal\" and anteroposterior directionality are equivalent in a significant portion of the human body, they are different directions in other parts of the body.\n\nIn anatomical terminology superior () is used to refer to what is above something, and inferior () to what is below it. For example, in the anatomical position the most superior part of the human body is the head, and the most inferior is the feet. As a second example, in humans the neck is superior to the chest but inferior to the head.\n\nAnterior refers to what is in front (, meaning \"before\") and posterior, what is to the back of the subject (, meaning \"after\"). For example, in a dog the nose is anterior to the eyes and the tail is considered the most posterior part; in many fish the gill openings are posterior to the eyes, but anterior to the tail.\n\nLateral () refers to the sides of an animal, as in \"left lateral\" and \"right lateral\". The term medial () is used to refer to structures close to the centre of an organism, called the \"median plane\". For example, in a human, imagine a line down the center of the body from the head though the navel and going between the legs— the medial side of the foot would be the big toe side; the medial side of the knee would be the side adjacent to the other knee. To describe the sides of the knees touching each other would be \"right medial\" and \"left medial\".\n\nThe terms \"left\" and \"right\" are sometimes used, or their Latin alternatives (; \"right\", ; \"left\"). However, as left and right sides are mirror images, using these words is somewhat confusing, as structures are duplicated on both sides. For example, it is very confusing to say the dorsal fin of a dolphin is \"right of\" the left pectoral fin, but is \"left of\" the right eye, but much easier and clearer to say \"the dorsal fin is medial to the pectoral fins\".\n\nDerived terms include:\n\n\nVarus and valgus correspond to medial and lateral, respectively, regarding the distal segment's vector relative to the proximal segment's vector.\n\nThe terms proximal () and distal () are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body, respectively. Thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal.\n\nThese terms are frequently used when describing appendages such as fins, tentacles, limbs or any structure that extends that can potentially move separately from the main body. Although the direction indicated by \"proximal\" and \"distal\" is always respectively towards or away from the point of attachment, a given structure can be either proximal or distal in relation to another point of reference. Thus the elbow is distal to a wound on the upper arm, but proximal to a wound on the lower arm.\n\nThis terminology is also employed in molecular biology and therefore by extension is also used in chemistry, specifically referring to the atomic loci of molecules from the overall moiety of a given compound.\n\nCentral and peripheral are terms that are closely related to concepts such as proximal and distal, but they are so widely applicable that in many respects their flexibility makes them hard to define. Loosely speaking, they distinguish near and far, inside and out, or even organs of vital importance such as heart and lungs, from peripheral organs such as fingers, that undoubtedly may be important, but which it may not be life-threatening to dispense with. Examples of the application of the terms are the distinction between central- and peripheral nervous systems, and between peripheral blood vessels and the central circulatory organs, such as the heart and major vessels. The terms also can apply to large and complex molecules such as proteins, where central amino acid residues are protected from antibodies or the like, but peripheral residues are important in docking and other interactions. Other examples include \"Central and peripheral circadian clocks\", and \"central versus peripheral vision\".\n\nThese two terms relate to the distance of a structure from the surface of an animal.\n\nDeep () refers to something further away from the surface of the organism. For example, the external oblique muscle of the abdomen is deep to the skin. \"Deep\" is one of the few anatomical terms of location derived from Old English rather than Latin – the anglicised Latin term would have been \"profound\" ().\n\nSuperficial () refers to something near the outer surface of the organism. For example, in skin the epidermis is superficial to the subcutis.\n\nThese two terms, used in anatomy and embryology, refer to back (\"dorsal\") and front or belly (\"ventral\") of an organism.\n\nThe dorsal () surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side, of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top.\n\nThe ventral () surface refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism.\n\nFor example, in a fish the pectoral fins are dorsal to the anal fin, but ventral to the dorsal fin.\n\nSpecific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal. To describe how close to the head of an animal something is, three distinct terms are used:\n\n\nFor example, in the horse, the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head.\n\nThese terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine. In humans, \"cranial\" and \"cephalic\" are used to refer to the skull, with \"cranial\" being used more commonly. The term \"rostral\" is rarely used in human anatomy, apart from embryology, and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism. Similarly, the term \"caudal\" is only occasionally used in human anatomy. This is because the brain is situated at the superior part of the head whereas the nose is situated in the anterior part. Thus the \"rostrocaudal axis\" refers to a C shape (see image).\n\nThe location of anatomical structures can also be described with relation to different anatomical landmarks.\n\nStructures may be described as being at the level of a specific spinal vertebra, depending on the section of the vertebral column the structure is at. The position is often abbreviated. For example, structures at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra may be abbreviated as \"C4\", at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra \"T4\", and at the level of the third lumbar vertebra \"L3\". Because the sacrum and coccyx are fused, they are not often used to provide location.\n\nReferences may also take origin from superficial anatomy, made to landmarks that are on the skin or visible underneath. For example, structures may be described relative to the anterior superior iliac spine, the medial malleolus or the medial epicondyle.\n\nAnatomical lines, theoretical lines drawn through structures, are also used to describe anatomical location. For example, the mid-clavicular line is used as part of the cardiac exam in medicine to feel the apex beat of the heart.\n\nFields such as osteology, palaeontology and dentistry apply special terms of location to describe the mouth and teeth. This is because although teeth may be aligned with their main axes within the jaw, some different relationships require special terminology as well; for example teeth also can be rotated, and in such contexts terms like \"anterior\" or \"lateral\" become ambiguous. Terms such as \"distal\" and \"proximal\" are also redefined to mean the distance away or close to the mandibular symphysis. Terms used to describe structures include \"buccal\" () and \"palatal\" () referring to structures close to the cheek and hard palate respectively.\n\nSeveral anatomical terms are particular to the hands and feet.\n\nFor improved clarity, the directional term palmar () is usually used to describe the front of the hand, and dorsal is the back of the hand. For example, the top of a dog's paw is its dorsal surface; the underside, either the palmar (on the forelimb) or the plantar (on the hindlimb) surface. The palmar fascia is palmar to the tendons of muscles which flex the fingers, and the dorsal venous arch is so named because it is on the dorsal side of the foot.\n\nVolar can also be used to refer to the underside of the palm or sole, which are themselves also sometimes used to describe location as \"palmar\" and \"plantar\". For example, volar pads are those on the underside of hands, fingers, feet, and toes.\n\nThese terms are used to avoid confusion when describing the median surface of the hand and what is the \"anterior\" or \"posterior\" surface \"anterior\" can be used to describe the palm of the hand, and \"posterior\" can be used to describe the back of the hand and arm. This confusion can arise because the forearm can pronate and supinate.\n\nSimilarly, in the forearm, for clarity, the sides are named after the bones. Structures closer to the radius are radial, structures closer to the ulna are ulnar, and structures relating to both bones are referred to as radioulnar. Similarly, in the lower leg, structures near the tibia (shinbone) are tibial and structures near the fibula are fibular (or peroneal).\n\nMost terms of anatomical location are relative to linear motion (translation) along the X- Y- and Z-axes, but there are other degrees of freedom as well, in particular, rotation around any of those three axes.\n\nAnteversion and retroversion are complementary anatomical terms of location, describing the degree to which an anatomical structure is rotated forwards (towards the front of the body) or backwards (towards the back of the body) respectively, relative to some datum position. The terms also describe the positioning of surgical implants, such as in arthroplasty.\n\n\nSeveral other terms are also used to describe location. These terms are not used to form the fixed axes. Terms include:\n\nDirectional and locational prefixes can modify many anatomical and morphological terms, sometimes in formally standard usage, but often attached arbitrarily according to need or convenience.\n\nPrefixes\n\nSuffixes\nCommonly when, for example, one anatomical feature is nearer to something than another, one may use an expression such as \"nearer the distal end\" or \"distal to\". However, an unambiguous and concise convention is to use the Latin suffix \"-ad\", meaning \"towards\", or sometimes \"to\". So for example, \"distad\" means \"in the distal direction\", and \"distad of the femur\" means \"beyond the femur in the distal direction\". The suffix may be used very widely, as in the following examples: anteriad (towards the anterior), apicad (towards the apex), basad (towards the basal end), caudad, centrad, cephalad (towards the cephalic end), craniad, dextrad, dextrocaudad, dextrocephalad, distad, dorsad, ectad (towards the ectal, or exterior, direction), entad (towards the interior), laterad, mediad, mesad, neurad, orad, posteriad, proximad, rostrad, sinistrad, sinistrocaudad, sinistrocephalad, ventrad\".\"\n\nThe large variety of body shapes present in invertebrates presents a difficult problem when attempting to apply standard directional terms. Depending on the organism, some terms are taken by analogy from vertebrate anatomy, and appropriate novel terms are applied as needed. Some such borrowed terms are widely applicable in most invertebrates; for example proximal, literally meaning \"near\" refers to the part of an appendage nearest to where it joins the body, and distal, literally meaning \"standing away from\" is used for the part furthest from the point of attachment. In all cases, the usage of terms is dependent on the body plan of the organism.\n\nFor example, especially in organisms without distinct heads for reasons of broader applicability, \"anterior\" is usually preferred.\n\nAs humans are approximately bilaterally symmetrical organisms, anatomical descriptions usually use the same terms as those for vertebrates and other members of the taxonomic group Bilateria. However, for historical and other reasons, standard human directional terminology has several differences from that used for other bilaterally symmetrical organisms.\n\nThe terms of zootomy and anatomy came into use at a time when all scientific communication took place in Latin. In their original Latin forms the respective meanings of \"anterior\" and \"posterior\" are \"in front of\" (or \"before\") and \"behind\" (or \"after\"), those of \"dorsal\" and \"ventral\" are \"toward the spine\" and \"toward the belly\", and those of \"superior\" and \"inferior\" are \"above\" and \"below\".\n\nHumans, however, have the rare property of having an upright torso. This makes their anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral directions the same, and the inferior/superior directions necessary.\n\nMost animals, furthermore, are capable of moving relative to their environment. So while \"up\" might refer to the direction of a standing human's head, the same term (\"up\") might be used to refer to the direction of the belly of a supine human. It is also necessary to employ some specific anatomical knowledge in order to apply the terminology unambiguously: For example, while the ears would be \"superior\" to (above) the shoulders in a human, this fails when describing the armadillo, where the shoulders are above the ears. Thus, in veterinary terminology, the ears would be \"cranial\" to (i.e., \"toward the head from\") the shoulders in the armadillo, the dog, the kangaroo, or any other terrestrial vertebrate, including the human. Likewise, while the belly is considered \"anterior\" to (in front of) the back in humans, this terminology fails for the flounder, the armadillo, and the dog. In veterinary terms, the belly would be \"ventral\" (\"toward the abdomen\") in all vertebrates.\n\nWhile it would be possible to introduce a system of axes that is completely consistent between humans and other vertebrates by having two separate pairs of axes, one used exclusively for the head (e.g., anterior/posterior and inferior/superior) and the other exclusively for the torso (e.g., dorsal/ventral and caudal/rostral, or \"toward the tail\"/\"toward the beak\"), doing so would require the renaming of many anatomical structures.\n\nIn organisms with a changeable shape, such as amoeboid organisms, most directional terms are meaningless, since the shape of the organism is not constant and no distinct axes are fixed. Similarly, in spherically symmetrical organisms, there is nothing to distinguish one line through the centre of the organism from any other. An indefinite number of triads of mutually perpendicular axes could be defined, but any such choice of axes would be useless, as nothing would distinguish a chosen triad from any others. In such organisms, only terms such as \"superficial\" and \"deep\", or sometimes \"proximal\" and \"distal\", are usefully descriptive.\nIn organisms that maintain a constant shape and have one dimension longer than the other, at least two directional terms can be used. The \"long\" or \"longitudinal axis\" is defined by points at the opposite ends of the organism. Similarly, a perpendicular \"transverse axis\" can be defined by points on opposite sides of the organism. There is typically no basis for the definition of a third axis. Usually such organisms are planktonic (free-swimming) protists, and are nearly always viewed on microscope slides, where they appear essentially two-dimensional. In some cases a third axis can be defined, particularly where a non-terminal cytostome or other unique structure is present.\n\nSome elongated protists have distinctive ends of the body. In such organisms, the end with a mouth (or equivalent structure, such as the cytostome in \"Paramecium\" or \"Stentor\"), or the end that usually points in the direction of the organism's locomotion (such as the end with the flagellum in \"Euglena\"), is normally designated as the anterior end. The opposite end then becomes the posterior end. Properly, this terminology would apply only to an organism that is always planktonic (not normally attached to a surface), although the term can also be applied to one that is sessile (normally attached to a surface).\n\nOrganisms that are attached to a substrate, such as sponges, or some animal-like protists also have distinctive ends. The part of the organism attached to the substrate is usually referred to as the basal end (), whereas the end furthest from the attachment is referred to as the apical end ().\n\nRadially symmetrical organisms include those in the group Radiata primarily jellyfish, sea anemones and corals and the comb jellies. Adult echinoderms, such as starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and others are also included, since they are pentaradial, meaning they have five discrete rotational symmetry. Echinoderm larvae are not included, since they are bilaterally symmetrical. Radially symmetrical organisms always have one distinctive axis.\n\nCnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones and corals) have an incomplete digestive system, meaning that one end of the organism has a mouth, and the opposite end has no opening from the gut (coelenteron). For this reason, the end of the organism with the mouth is referred to as the oral end (), and the opposite surface is the aboral end ().\n\nUnlike vertebrates, cnidarians have no other distinctive axes. \"Lateral\", \"dorsal\", and \"ventral\" have no meaning in such organisms, and all can be replaced by the generic term peripheral (). Medial can be used, but in the case of radiates indicates the central point, rather than a central axis as in vertebrates. Thus, there are multiple possible radial axes and medio-peripheral (half-) axes. However, it is noteworthy that some biradially symmetrical comb jellies do have distinct \"tentacular\" and \"pharyngeal\" axes and are thus anatomically equivalent to bilaterally symmetrical animals.\n\nAs with vertebrates, appendages that move independently of the body (tentacles in cnidarians and comb jellies), have a definite \"proximodistal axis\" (Fig. 9).\n\nTwo specialized terms are useful in describing views of arachnid legs and pedipalps. Prolateral refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the anterior end of an arachnid's body. Retrolateral refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the posterior end of an arachnid's body.\n\nBecause of the unusual nature and positions of the eyes of the Araneae (spiders), and their importance in taxonomy, evolution and anatomy, special terminology with associated abbreviations has become established in arachnology. Araneae normally have eight eyes in four pairs. All the eyes are on the carapace of the prosoma, and their sizes, shapes and locations are characteristic of various spider families and other taxa. In some taxa not all four pairs of eyes are present, the relevant species having only three, two, or one pair of eyes. Some species (mainly troglobites) have no functional eyes at all.\n\nIn what is seen as the likeliest ancestral arrangement of the eyes of the Araneae, there are two roughly parallel, horizontal, symmetrical, transverse rows of eyes, each containing two symmetrically placed pairs, respectively called: anterior and posterior lateral eyes (ALE) and (PLE); and anterior and posterior median eyes (AME) and (PME).\n\nAs a rule it is not difficult to guess which eyes are which in a living or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.\n\nCategories:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5454932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5454932", "title": "Bouncing ball (music)", "text": "Bouncing ball (music)\n\nThe bouncing ball is a device used in motion picture films and video recordings to visually indicate the rhythm of a song, helping audiences to sing along with live or prerecorded music. As the song's lyrics are displayed on the screen, an animated ball bounces across the top of the words, landing on each syllable when it is to be sung.\n\nThe bouncing ball is mainly used for English language songs in video recordings; however, in Japan, a similar device is used where the text changes color as it is sung, just like in karaoke.\n\nThe bouncing ball technique was invented by Max Fleischer originally for the \"Ko-Ko\" \"Song Car-Tunes\" (1924–1927) and revised in 1929 as Screen Songs (1929–1938) for Paramount. It was introduced in March 1924 with the film \"Come Take a Trip in my Airship\".\n\nIn early \"Song Car-Tunes\" such as \"Margie\" and Irving Berlin's \"When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam'\" the ball is animated, looking like a beach ball clumsily hitting the words without precise timing. This awkwardness was eliminated by filming the ball live over printed lyrics, and the ball attached to a black baton that \"bounced\" a white disc over the tops of the lyrics. The movement was captured on high-contrast film that rendered the stick invisible. The ball would usually appear as white-on-black, though sometimes the ball and lyrics would be superimposed over (darkened) still drawings or photographs or even live-action footage.\n\nWhile the Screen Song series started out employing standard songs such as \"Yankee Doodle Boy\", \"My Pony Boy\", and \"Yes! We Have No Bananas\", the series soon integrated live action appearances of celebrities of Broadway, radio, and recordings. Many of these Screen Songs were planned as promotions for live theatrical appearances. This was part of a new marketing plan launched by Paramount for the 1930–1931 season. Rudy Vallee was the first on-screen celebrity, appearing in \"Betty Co-Ed\" (1931), and returned in \"Kitty From Kansas City\" (1931). He also appeared in a cameo in \"Rudy Vallee Melodies\" (1932). Other celebrities included Arthur Tracy in \"Russian Lullaby\" (1931) and \"Romantic Melodies\" (1932), Ethel Merman in \"Let Me Call you Sweetheart\" (1932), \"You Try Somebody Else\" (1932), \"Time on my Hands\" (1932), and \"Song Shopping\" (1933).\n\nThe Mills Brothers appeared in three Screen Songs: \"I Ain't Got Nobody\" (1932), \"Dinah\" (1933), and \"When Yuba Plays the Rumba on the Tuba\" (1933). Lillian Roth appeared in \"Down Among the Sugar Cane\" (1932) and \"Ain't She Sweet\" (1933).\n\nRose Marie (later famous from television's Dick Van Dyke Show) was an established child singer in the late 1920s and made a number of early Vitaphone shorts for Warner Brothers billed as \"Baby Rose Marie\". She appeared in \"Sing Babies, Sing\" (1933). Radio comedians Stoopnagle and Budd appeared in the zany \"Stoopnocracy\" that also featured 12-year-old Harold Nicholas of the famous Nicholas Brothers Dance Team as a baby Cab Calloway.\n\nBy 1935, the Screen Songs series capitalized on the new Swing Era and featured appearances by a number of the Big Band Orchestras. This series of films was more commercially oriented with the films being booked a week in advance of live appearances of each orchestra. From 1935 to 1938, the \"Screen Songs\" featured the orchestras of Abe Lyman, Richard Huber, Hal Kemp, Vincent Lopez, Joe Reichman, Dick Stable, Nat Brandywine, Hal King, Shep Fields, Gus Arnheim, Jay Freeman, Jerry Baline, Bert Block, Frank Dailey, and Jimmy Dorsey. Although a popular attraction, the Screen Songs series was retired after nine years.\n\nThe Screen Songs were revived in 1945 starting with \"When G.I.

It is critically endangered, with no exclusively Caddo-speaking community and only 25 speakers as of 2009 who acquired the language as children outside school instruction. Caddo has several mutually intelligible dialects. The most commonly used dialects are Hasinai and Hainai; others include Kadohadacho, Natchitoches and Yatasi.\n\nCaddo is linguistically related to the members of the Northern Caddoan language family; these include the Pawnee-Kitsai (Keechi) languages (Arikara, Kitsai, and Pawnee) and the Wichita language. Kitsai is now extinct, and Pawnee, Arikara, and Wichita each have fewer surviving speakers than Caddo does.\n\nAnother language, Adai, is postulated to have been a Caddoan language while it was extant, but because of scarce resources and the language's extinct status, this connection is not conclusive, and Adai is generally considered a language isolate.\n\nThe Caddo Nation is making a concentrated effort to save the Caddo language. The Kiwat Hasinay ('Caddo Home') foundation, located at the tribal home of Binger, Oklahoma, offers regular Caddo language classes, in addition to creating dictionaries, phrase books, and other Caddo language resources. They have also made a long-term project of trying to record and digitally archive Caddoan oral traditions, which are an important part of Caddo culture. As of 2012, the Caddo Nation teaches weekly language classes; language CDs, a coloring book, and an online learning website are also available. As of 2010, a Caddo app is available for Android phones.\n\nCaddo has 19 contrastive consonants, a normal-sized consonant inventory. It is somewhat unusual in that it lacks lateral consonants. The IPA symbols for the consonants of Caddo are given below:\n\nCaddo also features contrastive gemination of consonants, which is generally indicated in orthography by a double letter: /nɑ́ttih/ \"woman.\"\n\nCaddo has three contrastive vowel qualities, , , and , and two contrastive vowel lengths, long and short, for a total of 6 vowel phonemes. \nHowever, there is a great deal of phonetic variation in the short vowels. The high front vowel is generally realized as its lower counterpart , and the high back vowel is similarly often realized as its lower counterpart . The low central vowel has a wider range of variation, pronounced (most commonly) as when it is followed by any consonant except a semivowel or a laryngeal consonant, as a low central vowel (for which IPA lacks a symbol) at the end of an open syllable or when followed by a laryngeal consonant, and as before a semivowel.\n\nIn general, the long vowels do not feature this kind of variation but are simply lengthened versions of the phonemes that are represented in the chart.\n\nCaddo also has four diphthongs, which can be written a number of different ways; the transcription below shows the typical Caddo Nation orthography (a vowel paired with a glide) and the IPA version, represented with vowels and offglides.\n\nCaddo is a tone language. There are three tones in Caddo: low tone, which is unmarked '; high tone, which is marked by an acute accent over the vowel '; and falling tone, which is always long and marked by a grave accent over the vowel .\n\nTone occurs both lexically (as a property of the word), non-lexically (as a result of tonological processes), and also as a marker of certain morphological features. For instance, the past tense marker is associated with high tone.\n\nThere are three processes that can create non-lexical high tone within a syllable nucleus. See the section below for an explanation of other phonological changes which may occur in the following examples.\n\nThere are two vowel syncope processes in Caddo, which both involve the loss of a low-tone vowel in certain environments. The first syncope process was described above as low tone-deletion. The second syncope process is described below:\n\nAs a result of the syncope processes described above, several consonant clusters emerge that are then simplified by way of phonological process. At the present stage of research, the processes seem to be unrelated, but they represent a phonetic reduction in consonant clusters; therefore, they are listed below without much further explanation.\n\nSimilar to the consonant cluster simplification process, there are four processes by which a syllable-final consonant is altered:\n\nThere are three word-boundary processes in Caddo, all of which occur word-initially:\n\nSuch processes are generally not applicable in the case of proclitics (morphemes that behave like an affix and are phonologically dependent on the morpheme to which they are attached). An example is the English articles.\n\nCaddo has a glottalization process by which any voiceless stop or affricate (except p) becomes an ejective when it is followed by a glottal stop.\n\nCaddo has a palatalization process that affects certain consonants when they are followed by /j/, with simultaneous loss of the /j/.\n\nCaddo has three processes by which a syllable nucleus (vowel) may be lengthened: \n\n\n"}

{"id": "195952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=195952", "title": "Catamaran", "text": "Catamaran\n\nA catamaran () (informally, a \"cat\") is a multi-hulled watercraft featuring two parallel hulls of equal size. It is a geometry-stabilized craft, deriving its stability from its wide beam, rather than from a ballasted keel as with a monohull sailboat. Catamaran is from a Tamil word \"Kattumaram\" which means logs tied together. \n\nCatamarans typically have less hull volume, higher displacement, and shallower draft (draught) than monohulls of comparable length. The two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic resistance than comparable monohulls, requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors. The catamaran's wider stance on the water can reduce both heeling and wave-induced motion, as compared with a monohull, and can give reduced wakes.\n\nCatamarans range in size from small (sailing or rowing vessels) to large (naval ships and car ferries). The structure connecting a catamaran's two hulls ranges from a simple frame strung with webbing to support the crew to a bridging superstructure incorporating extensive cabin and/or cargo space.\n\nCatamarans from Polynesia and Maritime Southeast Asia became the inspiration for modern catamarans.\n\nCatamaran-type vessels were first developed as early as 1500 BCE by the Polynesian peoples. These early examples were likely related to outrigger canoes and consisted of two canoes bound together with a wooden frame, sometimes accompanied by a sail. Despite their simplicity they were nonetheless effective, allowing seafaring Polynesians to voyage to distant Pacific islands.\n\nCatamarans were seldom constructed in the West before the 19th century, but they were in wide use as early as the 5th century by the Tamil people of Tamil Nadu, South India. The word \"catamaran\" is derived from the Tamil word, \"kattumaram\" (கட்டுமரம்), which means \"logs bound together.\" The 17th-century English adventurer and privateer William Dampier encountered the Tamil people of southeastern India during his first circumnavigation of the globe. He was the first to write in English about the watercraft he observed in use there. In his 1697 account of his trip, \"A New Voyage Round the World\", he wrote, \n\nThe first documented example of double-hulled craft in Europe was designed by William Petty in 1662 to sail faster, in shallower waters, in lighter wind, and with fewer crew than other vessels of the time. However, the unusual design met with skepticism and was not a commercial success.\n\nThe design remained relatively unused in the West for almost 160 years until the early 19th-century, when the Englishman Mayflower F. Crisp built a two-hulled merchant ship in Rangoon, Burma. The ship was christened \"Original\". Crisp described it as \"a fast sailing fine sea boat; she traded during the monsoon between Rangoon and the Tenasserim Provinces for several years\".\n\nLater that century, the American Nathanael Herreshoff constructed a double-hulled sailing boat of his own design (US Pat. No. 189,459). The craft, \"Amaryllis\", raced at her maiden regatta on June 22, 1876, and performed exceedingly well. Her debut demonstrated the distinct performance advantages afforded to catamarans over the standard monohulls. It was as a result of this event, the Centennial Regatta of the New York Yacht Club, that catamarans were barred from regular sailing classes, and this remained the case until the 1970s.\n\nIn 1936 Eric de Bisschop built a Polynesian \"double canoe\" in Hawaii and sailed it home to a hero's welcome in France. In 1939, he published his experiences in a book, \"Kaimiloa\", which was translated into English in 1940.\n\nThe Prout Brothers, Roland and Francis, experimented with catamarans in 1949 and converted their 1935 boat factory in Canvey Island, Essex (England), to catamaran production in 1954. Their Shearwater catamarans won races easily against the monohulls. \"Yellow Bird,\" a 1956-built Shearwater, raced successfully by Francis Prout in the 1960s, is in the collection of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, beachcats became a widespread category of sailing catamarans, owing to their ease of launching and mass production. In California, a maker of surfboards, Hobie Alter, produced the Hobie 14 in 1967, and two years later the larger and even more successful Hobie 16. As of 2016, the Hobie 16 was still being produced with more than 100,000 having been manufactured.\n\nThe Tornado catamaran was designed by three Englishmen for a crew of two in 1967 as an Olympic catamaran candidate. At the Olympic Catamaran Trials of the International Yacht Racing Union, IYRU, it outperformed the other challengers for the role and was selected for the multihull discipline in the Olympic Games from 1976 through 2008. It was redesigned in 2000 and remains one of the fastest double-handed catamaran models.\n\nAustralia became the site of builders of large transport catamarans—Incat in 1977 and Austal in 1988—each building civilian ferries and naval vessels.\n\nThe largest ship ever built in terms of gross tonnage, the \"Pioneering Spirit\", incorporates a catamaran design.\n\nCatamarans have two distinct primary performance characteristics that distinguish them from displacement monohull vessels: lower resistance to passage through the water and greater stability (initial resistance to capsize). Choosing between a monohull and catamaran configuration includes considerations of carrying capacity, speed, and efficiency.\n\nAt low to moderate speeds, a lightweight catamaran hull experiences resistance to passage through water that is approximately proportional to the square of its speed. A displacement monohull, by comparison, experiences resistance that is at least the cube of its speed. This means that a catamaran would require four times the power in order to double its speed, whereas a monohull would require eight times the power to double its speed, starting at a slow speed. For powered catamarans, this implies smaller power plants (although two are typically required). For sailing catamarans, low forward resistance allows the sails to derive power from attached flow, their most efficient mode—analogous to a wing—leading to the use of wingsails in racing craft.\n\nCatamarans rely primarily on form stability to resist heeling and capsize. Comparison of heeling stability of a rectangular-cross section monohull of beam, \"B\", compared with two catamaran hulls of width \"B\"/2, separated by a distance, 2×\"B\", determines that the catamaran has an initial resistance to heeling that is seven times that of the monohull. Compared with a monohull, a cruising catamaran sailboat has a high initial resistance to heeling and capsize—a fifty-footer requires four times the force to initiate a capsize than an equivalent monohull.\n\nOne measure of the trade-off between speed and carrying capacity is the displacement Froude number (Fn), compared with \"calm water transportation efficiency\". Fn applies when the waterline length is too speed-dependent to be meaningful—as with a planing hull. It uses a reference length, the cubic root of the volumetric displacement of the hull, \"V\", where \"u\" is the relative flow velocity between the sea and ship, and \"g\" is acceleration due to gravity:\n\n\"Calm water transportation efficiency\" of a vessel is proportional to the full-load displacement and the maximum calm-water speed, divided by the corresponding power required.\n\nLarge merchant vessels have a Fn between one and zero, whereas higher-performance powered catamarans may approach 2.5—denoting a \"higher speed\" per unit volume for \"catamarans\". Each type of vessel has a corresponding calm water transportation efficiency, with large transport ships being in the range of 100–1,000, compared with 11-18 for transport catamarans—denoting a \"higher efficiency\" per unit of payload for \"monohulls\".\n\nSailing catamarans have been noted for incorporating technological advances over traditional monohull craft. These include foils that lift racing catamarans out of the water, capacious and stable cruising vessels, and racers that have achieved average speeds on the open ocean, comparable to much larger vessels.\n\nRecreational and sport catamarans typically are designed to have a crew of two and be launched and landed from a beach. Most have a trampoline on the bridging structure, a rotating mast and full-length battens on the mainsail. Performance versions often have trapezes to allow the crew to hike out and counterbalance capsize forces during strong winds on certain points of sail.\n\nFor the 33rd America's Cup, both the defender and the challenger built long multihulls. Société Nautique de Genève, defending with team Alinghi, sailed a catamaran. The challenger, BMW Oracle Racing, used a trimaran, replacing its soft sail rig with a towering wing sail—the largest sailing wing ever built. In the waters off Valencia, Spain in February 2010, the BMW Oracle Racing trimaran with its powerful wing sail proved to be superior. This represented a break from the traditional monohulls that had always been sailed in previous America's Cup series.\n\nOn San Francisco Bay, the 2013 America's Cup was sailed in long AC72 catamarans (craft set by the rules for the 2013 America's Cup). Each yacht employed hydrofoils and a wing sail. The regatta was won 9-8 by Oracle Team USA against the challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand, in fifteen matches because Oracle Team USA had started the regatta with a two-point penalty.\n\nCruising sailors must make trade-offs among volume, useful load, speed, and cost in choosing a boat. Choosing a catamaran offers increased speed at the expense of reduced load per unit of cost. Howard and Doane describe the following tradeoffs between cruising monohulls and catamarans: A long-distance, offshore cruising monohull may be as short as for a given crew complement and supporting supplies, whereas a cruising catamaran would need to be to achieve the same capacity. In addition to greater speed, catamarans draw less water than do monohulls—little as —and are easier to beach. Catamarans are harder to tack and take up more space in a marina. Cruising catamarans entail added expense for having two engines and two rudders. Tarjan adds that cruising catamarans boats can maintain a comfortable per day passage, with the racing versions recording well over per day. In addition, they do not heel more than 10-12 degrees, even at full speed on a reach.\n\nYachting has seen the development of multihulls over in length. \"The Race\" helped precipitate this trend; it was a circumnavigation challenge which departed from Barcelona, Spain, on New Year's Eve, 2000. Because of the prize money and prestige associated with this event, four new catamarans (and two highly modified ones) over in length were built to compete. The largest, \"PlayStation\", owned by Steve Fossett, was long and had a mast which was above the water. Virtually all of the new mega-cats were built of pre-preg carbon fiber for strength and the lowest possible weight. The top speeds of these boats can approach . The Race was won by the -long catamaran \"Club Med\" skippered by Grant Dalton. It went round the globe in 62 days at an average speed of .\n\nA catamaran configuration fills a niche for powered vessels, where speed and sea-kindliness is favored over bulk capacity. In larger vessels, this niche favors car ferries and military vessels for patrol or operation in the littoral zone. Two advances over the traditional catamaran are the \"small-waterplane-area twin hull\" (SWATH) and the \"wave-piercing\" configuration—the latter having become a widely favored design.\n\nAn outgrowth of the popularity of cruising sailing catamarans are powered catamarans, which share many of the amenities found in a sail cruising catamaran. The saloon typically spans two hulls wherein are found the staterooms and engine compartments. As with sailing catamarans, this configuration minimizes boat motion in a seaway.\n\nThe Swiss-registered wave-piercing catamaran, \"Tûranor PlanetSolar\", which was launched in March 2010, is the world's largest solar powered boat. It completed a circumnavigation of the globe in 2012.\n\nThe 1970s saw the introduction of catamarans as a high-speed ferries, as pioneered by Westermoen Hydrofoil in Mandal, Norway, which launched the Westamaran design in 1973. The \"Stena Voyager\" was an example of a large, fast ferry, typically traveling at a speed of , although it was capable of doing over .\n\nMilitary Sealift Command currently operates several Expeditionary Fast Transport catamarans which are owned by the U.S. Navy. These are employed for the high speed transport of military cargo and are able to get into shallow ports due to their small draft.\n\nThe \"Makar\"-class is a class of two large catamaran-hull survey ships built for the Indian Navy. As of 2012, one vessel, INS Makar (J31), was in service and the second was under construction.\n\nFirst launched in 2004 at Shanghai, the Houbei class missile boat of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) utilizes a catamaran hull designed to accommodate the vessel's stealth features.\n\nThe small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH) configuration reduces wave-generating resistance by moving displacement volume below the waterline, using a pair of tubular, submarine-like hulls, connected by pylons to the bridge deck with a narrow waterline cross-section. The submerged hulls are minimally affected by waves. The SWATH form was invented by Canadian Frederick G. Creed, who presented his idea in 1938 and was later awarded a British patent for it in 1946. It was first used in the 1960s and 1970s as an evolution of catamaran design for use as oceanographic research vessels or submarine rescue ships. In 1990, the US Navy commissioned the construction of a SWATH ship to test the configuration.\n\nSWATH vessels compare with conventional powered catamarans of equivalent size, as follows:\n\nWave-piercing catamarans employ a low-buoyancy bow on each hull that is pointed at the water line and rises aft, up to a level, to allow each hull to pierce waves, rather than ride over them. This allows higher speeds through waves than for a conventional catamaran. They are distinguished from SWATH catamarans, in that the buoyant part of the hull is not tubular. The spanning bridge deck may be configured with some of the characteristics of a normal V-hull, which allows it to penetrate the crests of waves.\n\nWave-piercing catamaran designs have been employed for yachts, passenger ferries, and military vessels.\n\nThe catamarans for whitewater sports are widely spread in post-Soviet countries. They consists of two inflatable hulls connected with a lattice scaffold. The frame of the tourist catamaran can be made of both - aluminum (duralumin) pipes, and from felled tree trunks. The inflatable part has two layers - airtight balloon with inflation holes and shell made of dense tissue, protecting the balloon from mechanical damage. \n\nAdvantages of such catamarans are light weight, compactness and convenience in transportation (the whole product is packed in one pack-backpack, suitable for air traffic standards), the speed of assembly (10-15 minutes for the inflation). Landing on such a catamaran can be a raft-type, as well as a sports knee-type.\n\n"}

This is, however, incorrect, as the primary meaning of the character pronounced \"jī\" () is not \"opportunity\".\n\nAmerican linguist Benjamin Zimmer has traced mentions in English of the Chinese term for \"crisis\" as far as an anonymous editorial in a 1938 journal for missionaries in China. But its use probably gained momentum in the United States after John F. Kennedy employed this trope in speeches in 1959 and 1960:\nIn the Chinese language, the word \"crisis\" is composed of two characters,\none representing danger and the other, opportunity.\n\nReferencing the word has since become a staple meme for American business consultants and motivational speakers, as well as gaining popularity in educational institutions, politics and in the popular press. For example, in 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice applied it during Middle East peace talks. Former Vice President Al Gore did so both in testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, in the introduction of \"An Inconvenient Truth\", and in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance lecture.\n\nBenjamin Zimmer attributes the appeal of this anecdote to its \"handiness\" as a rhetorical device and optimistic \"call to action\", as well as to \"wishful thinking\".\n\nSinologist Victor H. Mair of the University of Pennsylvania states the popular interpretation of \"wēijī\" as \"danger\" plus \"opportunity\" is a \"widespread public misperception\" in the English-speaking world. While the character \"wēi\" () does indeed mean \"dangerous\" or \"precarious\", the character \"jī\" () is highly polysemous and does not, in isolation, translate as \"opportunity\". The confusion no doubt arises from the fact that \"jī\" (機) is a component of the Chinese word for \"opportunity\" \"jīhuì\" (機會／机会, literally \"meeting a critical point\").\n\nAccording to the 10th Edition of \"Xinhua Zidian\", the best-selling Chinese dictionary, the character \"jī\" (機) in \"wēijī\" (危機) means \"a point where things happen or change\", this meaning appears to be neutral, from which derive two other meanings: \"an event that has a confidential nature\", and \"chance (opportunity), good timing\" which appears to be a positive one.\n\n"}
{"id": "206610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206610", "title": "Comparative", "text": "Comparative\n\nIn linguistics, the comparative is a syntactic construction that serves to express a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, or degree. See comparison (grammar) for an overview of comparison, as well as positive and superlative degrees of comparison.\n\nEx: \" This sofa is more comfortable than that one. \" \"James is smaller than Chris.\"\nThe syntax of comparative constructions is poorly understood due to the complexity of the data. In particular, the comparative frequently occurs with independent mechanisms of syntax such as coordination and forms of ellipsis (gapping, pseudogapping, null complement anaphora, stripping, verb phrase ellipsis). The interaction of the various mechanisms complicates the analysis.\n\nA number of fixed expressions use a comparative form where no comparison is being asserted, such as \"higher education\" or \"younger generation\". These comparatives can be called \"absolute\".\n\nSimilarly, a null comparative is one in which the starting point for comparison is not stated. These comparisons are frequently found in advertising, for example, in typical assertions such as \"Our burgers have more flavor\", \"Our picture is sharper\" or \"50% more\". These uses of the comparative do not mention what it is they are being compared to. In some cases it is easy to infer what the missing element in a null comparative is. In other cases, the speaker or writer has been deliberately vague, for example \"Glasgow's miles better\".\n\nScientific classification, taxonomy, and geographical categorization conventionally include the adjectives \"greater\" and \"lesser\", when a \"large\" or \"small\" variety of an item is meant, as in the greater celandine as opposed to the lesser celandine. These adjectives may at first sight appear as a kind of \"null comparative\", when as is usual, they are cited without their opposite counterpart. It should be apparent, however, that an entirely different variety of animal, scientific, or geographical object is intended. Thus it may be found, for example, that the lesser panda entails a giant panda variety, and a gazetteer would establish that there are the Lesser Antilles as well as the Greater Antilles. It is in the nature of grammatical conventions evolving over time that it is difficult to establish when they first became widely accepted, but both \"greater\" and \"lesser\" in these instances have over time become mere adjectives (or adverbial constructs), so losing their \"comparative\" connotation. Further, \"Greater\" indicates the inclusion adjacent areas when referring to metropolitan areas, such as when suburbs are intended. Although it implies a comparison with a narrower definition that refers to a central city only, such as Greater London versus the City of London, or Greater New York versus New York City, it is not part of the \"comparative\" in the grammatical sense of this article. A comparative always compares something directly with something else.\n\nAt times the syntax of comparatives matches the syntax of coordination, and at other times, it must be characterized in terms of subordination.\n\nThe syntax of comparatives can closely mirror the syntax of coordination. The similarity in structure across the following a- and b-sentences illustrates this point. The conjuncts of the coordinate structures are enclosed in square brackets:\n\nThe structure of the b-sentences involving comparatives is closely similar to the structure of the a-sentences involving coordination. Based on this similarity, many have argued that the syntax of comparatives overlaps with the syntax of coordination at least some of the time. In this regard, the \"than\" in the b-sentences should be viewed as a coordinator (coordinate conjunction), not as a subordinator (subordinate conjunction).\n\nExamples of the comparative that do not allow an analysis in terms of coordination (because the necessary parallel structures are not present) are instances of comparative subordination. In such cases, \"than\" has the status of a preposition or a subordinator (subordinate conjunction), e.g.\n\nSince the parallel structures associated with coordinate structures, i.e., the conjuncts, cannot be acknowledged in these sentences, the only analysis available is one in terms of subordination, whereby \"than\" has the status of a subordinator (as in sentences a-d) or of a preposition (as in sentence e). What this means is that the syntax of comparatives is complex because at times an analysis in terms of coordination is warranted, whereas at other times, the analysis must assume subordination.\n\nThere are two types of ellipsis that are unique to the \"than\"-clauses of comparatives: \"comparative deletion\" and \"comparative subdeletion\". The existence of comparative deletion as an ellipsis mechanism is widely acknowledged, whereas the status of comparative subdeletion as an ellipsis mechanism is more controversial.\n\nComparative deletion is an obligatory ellipsis mechanism that occurs in the \"than\"-clause of a comparative construction. The elided material of comparative deletion is indicated using a blank, and the unacceptable b-sentences show what is construed as having been elided in the a-sentences:\n\nComparative subdeletion is a second type of ellipsis in comparatives that some accounts acknowledge. It occurs when the focused constituent in the \"than\"-clause is not deleted because it is distinct from its counterpart in the main clause. In other words, comparative subdeletion occurs when comparative deletion does not because the constituents being compared are distinct, e.g.\n\nAccounts that acknowledge comparative subdeletion posit a null measure expression in the position marked by the blank (x-many, x-much). This element serves to focus the expression in the same way that \"-er\" or \"more\" focuses its counterpart in the main clause. Various arguments are put forth that motivate the existence of this null element. These arguments will not be reproduced here, though. Suffice it to say that the sentences in which subdeletion is supposedly occurring are qualitatively different from sentences in which comparative deletion occurs, e.g., \"He has more cats than you have ___ .\"\n\nThere are a number of independent ellipsis mechanisms that occur in the \"than-\"clauses of comparative constructions: gapping, pseudogapping, null complement anaphora, stripping, and verb phrase ellipsis. These mechanisms are independent of comparative clauses because they also occur when the comparative is not involved. The presence of these ellipsis mechanisms in \"than\"-clauses complicates the analysis considerably, since they render it difficult to discern which aspects of the syntax of comparatives are unique to comparatives.\n\nThe fact that the five independent ellipsis mechanisms (and possibly others) can occur in the \"than\"-clauses of comparatives has rendered the study of the syntax of comparatives particularly difficult. One is often not sure which ellipsis mechanisms are involved in a given \"than\"-clause. One thing is clear, however: the five ellipsis mechanisms illustrated here are distinct from the two ellipsis mechanisms that are unique to comparatives mentioned above (comparative deletion and comparative subdeletion).\n\n"}
{"id": "394787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=394787", "title": "Drill string", "text": "Drill string\n\nA drill string on a drilling rig is a column, or string, of drill pipe that transmits drilling fluid (via the mud pumps) and torque (via the kelly drive or top drive) to the drill bit. The term is loosely applied to the assembled collection of the drill pipe, drill collars, tools and drill bit. The drill string is hollow so that drilling fluid can be pumped down through it and circulated back up the annulus (the void between the drill string and the casing/open hole).\n\nThe drill string is typically made up of three sections:\n\nThe BHA is made up of: a drill bit, which is used to break up the rock formations; drill collars, which are heavy, thick-walled tubes used to apply weight to the drill bit; and drilling stabilizers, which keep the assembly centered in the hole. The BHA may also contain other components such as a downhole motor and rotary steerable system, measurement while drilling (MWD), and logging while drilling (LWD) tools. The components are joined together using rugged threaded connections. Short \"subs\" are used to connect items with dissimilar threads.\n\nHeavyweight drill pipe (HWDP) may be used to make the transition between the drill collars and drill pipe. The function of the HWDP is to provide a flexible transition between the drill collars and the drill pipe. This helps to reduce the number of fatigue failures seen directly above the BHA. A secondary use of HWDP is to add additional weight to the drill bit. HWDP is most often used as weight on bit in deviated wells. The HWDP may be directly above the collars in the angled section of the well, or the HWDP may be found before the kick off point in a shallower section of the well.\n\nDrill pipe makes up the majority of the drill string back up to the surface. Each drill pipe comprises a long tubular section with a specified outside diameter (e.g. 3 1/2 inch, 4 inch, 5 inch, 5 1/2 inch, 5 7/8 inch, 6 5/8 inch). At each end of the drill pipe tubular, larger-diameter portions called the tool joints are located. One end of the drill pipe has a male (\"pin\") connection whilst the other has a female (\"box\") connection. The tool joint connections are threaded which allows for the mating of each drill pipe segment to the next segment.\n\nMost components in a drill string are manufactured in 31 foot lengths (range 2) although they can also be manufactured in 46 foot lengths (range 3). Each 31 foot component is referred to as a joint. Typically 2, 3 or 4 joints are joined together to make a stand. Modern onshore rigs are capable of handling ~90 ft stands (often referred to as a triple).\n\nPulling the drill string out of or running the drill string into the hole is referred to as tripping. Drill pipe, HWDP and collars are typically racked back in stands in to the monkeyboard which is a component of the derrick if they are to be run back into the hole again after, say, changing the bit. The disconnect point (\"break\") is varied each subsequent round trip so that after three trips every connection has been broken apart and later made up again with fresh pipe dope applied.\n\nA stuck drill string can be caused by many situations.\n\n\nOnce the tubular member is stuck, there are many techniques used to extract the pipe. The tools and expertise are normally supplied by an oilfield service company. Two popular tools and techniques are the oilfield jar and the surface resonant vibrator. Below is a history of these tools along with how they operate.\n\nThe mechanical success of cable tool drilling has greatly depended on a device called jars, invented by a spring pole driller, William Morris, in the salt well days of the 1830s. Little is known about Morris except for his invention and that he listed Kanawha County (now in West Virginia) as his address. Morris received for this unique tool in 1841 for artesian well drilling. Later, using jars, the cable tool system was able to efficiently meet the demands of drilling wells for oil.\n\nThe jars were improved over time, especially at the hands of the oil drillers, and reached the most useful and workable design by the 1870s, due to another received in 1868 by Edward Guillod of Titusville, Pennsylvania, which addressed the use of steel on the jars' surfaces that were subject to the greatest wear. Many years later, in the 1930s, very strong steel alloy jars were made.\n\nA set of jars consisted of two interlocking links which could telescope. In 1880 they had a play of about 13 inches such that the upper link could be lifted 13 inches before the lower link was engaged. This engagement occurred when the cross-heads came together.Today, there are two primary types, hydraulic and mechanical jars. While their respective designs are quite different, their operation is similar. Energy is stored in the drillstring and suddenly released by the jar when it fires. Jars can be designed to strike up, down, or both. In the case of jarring up above a stuck bottomhole assembly, the driller slowly pulls up on the drillstring but the BHA does not move. Since the top of the drillstring is moving up, this means that the drillstring itself is stretching and storing energy. When the jars reach their firing point, they suddenly allow one section of the jar to move axially relative to a second, being pulled up rapidly in much the same way that one end of a stretched spring moves when released. After a few inches of movement, this moving section slams into a steel shoulder,\nimparting an impact load.\n\nIn addition to the mechanical and hydraulic versions, jars are classified as drilling jars or fishing jars. The operation of the two types is similar, and both deliver approximately the same impact blow, but the drilling jar is built such that it can better withstand the rotary and vibrational loading associated with drilling. Jars are designed to be reset by simple string manipulation and are capable of repeated operation or firing before being recovered from the well. Jarring effectiveness is\ndetermined by how rapidly you can impact weight into the jars. When jarring without a compounder or accelerator you rely only on pipe stretch to lift the drill collars upwards after the jar releases to create the upwards impact in the jar. This accelerated upward movement will often be reduced by the friction of the working string along the sides of the well bore, reducing the speed of upwards movement of the drill collars which impact into the jar. At shallow depths jar impact is not achieved because of lack of pipe stretch in the working string.\n\nWhen pipe stretch alone cannot provide enough energy to free a fish, compounders or accelerators are used. Compounders or accelerators are energized when you over pull on the working string and compress a compressible fluid through a few feet of stroke distance and at the same time activate the fishing jar. When the fishing jar releases the stored energy in the compounder/acclerator lifts the drill collars upwards at a high rate of speed creating a high impact in the jar.\n\nJars rely on the principle of stretching a pipe to build elastic potential energy such that when the jar trips it relies on the masses of the drill pipe and collars to gain velocity and subsequently strike the anvil section of jar. This impact results in a force, or blow, which is converted into energy.\n\nThe concept of using vibration to free stuck objects from a wellbore originated in the 1940s, and probably stemmed from the 1930s use of vibration to drive piling in the Soviet Union. The early use of vibration for driving and extracting piles was confined to low frequency operation; that is, frequencies less than the fundamental resonant frequency of the system and consequently, although effective, the process was only an improvement on conventional hammer equipment. Early patents and teaching attempted to explain the process and mechanism involved, but lacked a certain degree of sophistication. In 1961, A. G. Bodine obtained that was to become the \"mother patent\" for oil field tubular extraction using sonic techniques. Mr. Bodine introduced the concept of resonant vibration that effectively eliminated the reactance portion of mechanical impedance, thus leading to the means of efficient sonic power transmission. Subsequently, Mr. Bodine obtained additional patents directed to more focused applications of the technology.\n\nThe first published work on this technique was outlined in a 1987 Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) paper presented at the International Association of Drilling Contractors in Dallas, Texas detailing the nature of the work and the operational results that were achieved. The cited work involving liner, tubing, and drill pipe extraction and was very successful. Reference Two presented at the Society of Petroleum Engineers Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition in Anaheim, California, November, 2007 explains the resonant vibration theory in more detail as well as its use in extracting long lengths of mud stuck tubulars.\n\nSurface Resonant Vibrators rely on the principle of counter rotating eccentric weights to impart a sinusoidal harmonic motion from the surface into the work string at the surface. Reference Three (above) provides a full explanation of this technology. The frequency of rotation, and hence vibration of the pipe string, is tuned to the resonant frequency of the system. The system is defined as the surface resonant vibrator, pipe string, fish and retaining media. The resultant forces imparted to the fish is based on the following logic:\n\n\n"}

It is a conjecture of Alexander Grothendieck from the late 1960s, and apparently not published by him in any form.\n\nThe general case remains unsolved, despite recent progress; it has been linked to geometric investigations involving algebraic foliations.\n\nIn a simplest possible statement the conjecture can be stated in its essentials for a vector system written as\n\nfor a vector \"v\" of size \"n\", and an \"n\"×\"n\" matrix \"A\" of algebraic functions with algebraic number coefficients. The question is to give a criterion for when there is a \"full set\" of algebraic function solutions, meaning a fundamental matrix (i.e. \"n\" vector solutions put into a block matrix). For example, a classical question was for the hypergeometric equation: when does it have a pair of algebraic solutions, in terms of its parameters? The answer is known classically as Schwarz's list. In monodromy terms, the question is of identifying the cases of finite monodromy group.\n\nBy reformulation and passing to a larger system, the essential case is for rational functions in \"A\" and rational number coefficients. Then a necessary condition is that for almost all prime numbers \"p\", the system defined by reduction modulo \"p\" should also have a full set of algebraic solutions, over the finite field with \"p\" elements.\n\nGrothendieck's conjecture is that these necessary conditions, for almost all \"p\", should be sufficient. The connection with \"p\"-curvature is that the mod \"p\" condition stated is the same as saying the \"p\"-curvature, formed by a recurrence operation on \"A\", is zero; so another way to say it is that \"p\"-curvature of 0 for almost all \"p\" implies enough algebraic solutions of the original equation.\n\nNicholas Katz has applied Tannakian category techniques to show that this conjecture is essentially the same as saying that the differential Galois group \"G\" (or strictly speaking the Lie algebra g of the algebraic group \"G\", which in this case is the Zariski closure of the monodromy group) can be determined by mod \"p\" information, for a certain wide class of differential equations.\n\nA wide class of cases has been proved by Benson Farb and Mark Kisin; these equations are on a locally symmetric variety \"X\" subject to some group-theoretic conditions. This work is based on the previous results of Katz for Picard–Fuchs equations (in the contemporary sense of the Gauss–Manin connection), as amplified in the Tannakian direction by André. It also applies a version of superrigidity particular to arithmetic groups. Other progress has been by arithmetic methods.\n\nNicholas Katz related some cases to deformation theory in 1972, in a paper where the conjecture was published. Since then, reformulations have been published. A q-analogue for difference equations has been proposed.\n\nIn responding to Kisin's talk on this work at the 2009 Colloque Grothendieck, Katz gave a brief account from personal knowledge of the genesis of the conjecture. Grothendieck put it forth in public discussion in Spring 1969, but wrote nothing on the topic. He was led to the idea by foundational intuitions in the area of crystalline cohomology, at that time being developed by his student Pierre Berthelot. In some way wishing to equate the notion of \"nilpotence\" in the theory of connections, with the divided power structure technique that became standard in crystalline theory, Grothendieck produced the conjecture as a by-product.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21023203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21023203", "title": "Intact forest landscape", "text": "Intact forest landscape\n\nAn intact forest landscape (IFL) is an unbroken natural landscape of a forest ecosystem and its habitat–plant community components, in an extant forest zone. An IFL is a natural environment with no signs of significant human activity or habitat fragmentation, and of sufficient size to contain, support, and maintain the complex of indigenous biodiversity of viable populations of a wide range of biota genera and species, and their ecological effects.\n\nIFLs are estimated to cover 23 percent of forest ecosystems (13.1 million km). Two biomes hold almost all of these IFLs: dense tropical and subtropical forests (45 percent) and boreal forests (44 percent), while the proportion of IFLs in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests is very small. IFLs remain in 66 of the 149 countries that could potentially have them. Three of these countries, Canada, Russia, and Brazil, contain 64 percent of the total IFL area. Nineteen percent of the global IFL area is under some form of protection, but only 10 percent is strictly protected, i.e., belongs to IUCN protected areas categories I–III. It is estimated that the planet has lost seven percent of its IFLs since 2000.\n\nThe term \"intact forest landscape\" was developed by a group of environmental non-governmental organizations including Greenpeace, the World Resources Institute, Biodiversity Conservation Center, International Socio-Ecological Union, and Transparent World. IFL has been used in regional and global forest monitoring projects such as Intact-Forests.org, and in scientific forest ecology research.\nThe concept of an intact forest landscape and its technical definition were developed to help create, implement, and monitor policies concerning the human impact on forest landscapes at the regional or country levels.\n\nTechnically, an IFL is defined as an area which contains forest and non-forest ecosystems minimally influenced by human economic activity, with an area of at least 500 km (50,000 ha) and a minimal width of 10 km (measured as the diameter of a circle that is entirely inscribed within the boundaries of the territory).\n\nAreas with evidence of certain types of human influence are considered \"disturbed\" and not eligible for inclusion in an IFL:\n\nAreas with evidence of low intensity and old disturbances are treated as subject to “background” influence and are eligible for inclusion in an IFL. Sources of background influence include local shifting cultivation activities, diffuse grazing by domesticated animals, low-intensity selective logging and hunting.\n\nThis definition builds on and refines the concept of a frontier forest as has been used by the World Resources Institute.\n\nMost of the world’s original forests have either been lost to conversion or altered by logging and forest management. Forests that still combine large size with insignificant human influence are becoming increasingly important as their global extent continues to shrink.\n\nEcosystems are generally better able to support their natural biological diversity and ecological processes the lower their exposure to humans and the greater their area. They are also better able to absorb and recover from disturbance (resistance and resilience).\n\nFragmentation and loss of natural habitats are the main factors threatening plant and animal species with extinction. Forest biodiversity largely depends on intact forest landscapes. Large roaming animals (such as forest elephants, great apes, bears, wolves, tigers, jaguars, eagles, deer, etc.) especially require that intact forest landscapes be preserved. Loss of natural habitat can occur through introduction of forest monoculture or by even aged timber management, which are also destructive of biodiversity and wildlife abundance. For example, many wildlife species such as the wild turkey depend upon variegation of tree ages and sizes for its optimal sub-canopy flight; forests that have been managed for even aged composition fail to achieve abundance values of the wild turkey and many other organisms.\n\nLarge natural forest areas are also important for maintaining ecological processes and supplying ecosystem services like water and air purification, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, erosion and flood control.\n\nThe conservation value of forest landscapes that are free from human disturbance is therefore high, although it varies among regions. At the same time the cost of conserving large unpopulated areas is often low. The same factors that have kept them from being developed, such as remoteness and low economic value, also help to reduce the cost of protecting them.\n\nSeveral international initiatives to protect forest biodiversity (CBD), to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (IGBP, REDD), and to stimulate use of sustainable forest management practices (FSC) require that large natural forest areas be preserved. Mapping, conservation and monitoring of intact forest landscapes is a therefore a task of global importance.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made since the 1990s to map the remaining extent of large natural forests. At the global level, these include: wilderness area maps by McCloskey and Spalding; human footprint map by Sanderson, et al.; and frontier forests map by Bryant, et al. These efforts have generally combined already existing maps and information to identify areas of low human impact at a coarse scale, typically no finer than 1:16 million.\n\nThe IFL mapping initiatives differ from these by using the IFL definition mentioned above, by using information from satellites in addition to other sources, and by producing results at a much finer scale, approximately 1:1 million.\n\nThe first regional IFL map was presented by Greenpeace Russia in 2001, covering northern European Russia. The report also contains a complete description of the IFL concept and the mapping algorithm.\n\nA number of regional IFL maps were presented in 2002–2006, using similar methods, by a group of scientists and environmental non-governmental organizations under the framework of Global Forest Watch, an initiative of the World Resources Institute.\n\nUsing the same method, a global IFL map was prepared in 2005–2006 under the leadership of Greenpeace, with contributions from the Biodiversity Conservation Center, International Socio-Ecological Union, Transparent World (Russia), Finnish Nature League, Forest Watch Indonesia, and Global Forest Watch.\n\nThe global IFL map relies on publicly available high spatial resolution satellite imagery provided by Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) and USGS and on a simple and consistent set of criteria.\n\nThe IFL concept is a useful tool for making, implementing, and monitoring policy in the realms of sustainable forest management, conservation and climate, as shown by the following examples.\n\nThe distinction between intact and non-intact forest landscapes can be used to account for losses of carbon from forest degradation, as proposed by Mollicone, et al. The global IFL map provides a geographically explicit baseline with several advantages:\n\nConservation of large IFLs is a robust and cost-effective way to protect biodiversity and maintain ecological integrity and should therefore be an important component of a global conservation strategy. The remoteness and large size of these areas provide the best guarantee for their continued intactness. Withdrawing remaining intact areas from the production base would lead to small or negligible economic loss.\n\nRussian NGOs have, for example, used IFL maps to argue that the most valuable of the remaining intact natural landscapes of northern European Russia and Far East be preserved, and to propose several new national parks: Kutsa and Hibiny (Murmansk Region), Kalevalsky (Karelia Republic) and Onezhskoye Pomorye (Arkhangelsk Region).\n\nSeveral boreal countries are using the IFL concept in the context of forest certification. One of the categories of High Conservation Value Forest used by the Forest Stewardship Council is analogous to that of IFLs. The formulation used in the Canadian and Russian national FSC standards—globally, nationally, or regionally significant forest landscapes, un-fragmented by permanent infrastructure and of a size to maintain viable populations of most species—calls for IFL maps for implementation. IFLs are directly mentioned among other categories of High Conservation Value Forest in the FSC Controlled Wood standard.\n\nSeveral retailers, including IKEA and Lowe's, have committed not to use wood from IFLs unless intactness values are preserved. Others, such as Bank of America, invest only in companies that maintain such values. These companies use regional IFL maps to implement their policies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1861821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1861821", "title": "Interpellation (philosophy)", "text": "Interpellation (philosophy)\n\nIn Marxist theory, interpellation is an important concept regarding the notion of ideology. It is associated in particular with the work of French philosopher Louis Althusser. According to Althusser, every society is made up of Ideological State Apparatuses (ISAs) and Repressive State Apparatuses (RSAs) which are instrumental to constant reproduction of the relations to production of that given society. While ISAs belong to the private domain and refer to private institutions (family, church but also the media and politics), the RSA is one public institution (police/military) controlled by the government. Consequently, 'interpellation' describes the process by which ideology, embodied in major social and political institutions (ISAs and RSAs), constitutes the very nature of individual subjects' identities through the process of \"hailing\" them in social interactions.\n\nAlthusser’s thought has made significant contributions to other French philosophers, notably Derrida, Kristeva, Barthes, Foucault, and Deleuze.\n\nIn \"Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an Investigation)\", Althusser introduces the concepts of Ideological State Apparatuses (ISA), Repressive State Apparatuses (RSAs), ideology, and interpellation. In his writing, Althusser argues that \"there is no ideology except by the subject and for the subject\". This notion of subjectivity becomes central to his writings.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, Althusser gives the example of a friend who knocks on a door. The person inside asks \"Who is there?\" and only opens the door once the \"It’s me\" from the outside sounds familiar. By doing so, the person inside partakes in \"a material ritual practice of ideological recognition in everyday life\". In other words, Althusser’s central thesis is that \"you and I are always already subjects\" and are constantly engaging in everyday rituals, like greeting someone or shaking hands, which makes us subjected to ideology.\n\nAlthusser goes further to argue that \"all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects\" and emphasizes that \"ideology ‘acts’ or ‘functions’ in such a way that it ... ‘transforms’ the individual into subjects\". This is made possible through Althusser’s notion of interpellation or hailing which is a non-specific and unconscious process. For example, when a police officer shouts (or hails) \"Hey, you there!\" and an individual turns around and so-to-speak ‘answers’ the call, he becomes a subject. Althusser argues that this is because the individual has realized that the hailing was addressed at him which makes him subjective to the ideology of democracy and law.\n\nConsequently, individual subjects are presented principally as produced by social forces, rather than acting as powerful independent agents with self-produced identities.\n\nAlthusser's argument here strongly draws from Jacques Lacan's concept of the mirror stage. However, unlike Lacan who distinguishes between the \"I\" and the \"subject\", Althusser collapses both concepts into one.\n\nGerman philosophers Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer employ a method of analysis similar to Althusser's notion of interpellation in their text \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\", although they do so 26 years before \"Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses\" was released. Rather than situating their analysis on the State, Adorno and Horkheimer argue that the mass media is responsible for the construction of passive subjects. So unlike the police officer in Althusser’s example who reinforces the ideology of democracy and law, the mass media has now taken over this role and interpellates, or hails at, the passive consumer.\n\nFeminist scholar and queer theorist Judith Butler has critically applied a framework based on interpellation to highlight the social construction of gender identities. She argues that by hailing \"It’s a boy/girl,\" the newborn baby is ultimately positioned as subject.\n\nMedia theorist David Gauntlett argues that \"interpellation occurs when a person connects with a media text: when we enjoy a magazine or TV show, for example, this\nuncritical consumption means that the text has \"interpellated\" us into a certain set of assumptions, and caused us to tacitly accept a particular approach to the world.\"\n"}
{"id": "665483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=665483", "title": "Jin Chinese", "text": "Jin Chinese\n\nJin () is a group of Chinese dialects or languages spoken by roughly 63 million people in northern China. Its geographical distribution covers most of Shanxi province except for the lower Fen River valley, much of central Inner Mongolia and adjoining areas in Hebei, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces. The status of Jin is disputed among linguists: Some prefer to classify it as a dialect of Mandarin, but others set it apart as a closely related, but separate sister-language to Mandarin.\n\nUntil the 1980s, Jin dialects were universally included within Mandarin Chinese. In 1985, however, Li Rong proposed that Jin should be considered a separate top-level dialect group, similar to Yue or Wu. His main criterion was that Jin dialects had preserved the entering tone as a separate category, still marked with a glottal stop as in the Wu dialects, but distinct in this respect from most other Mandarin dialects.\n\nOther linguists have subsequently adopted this classification. However, some linguists still do not agree that Jin should be considered a separate dialect group for these reasons:\n\nIn the \"Language Atlas of China\", Jin was divided into 8 subgroups:\n\nUnlike most varieties of Mandarin, Jin has preserved a final glottal stop, which is the remnant of a final stop consonant (, or ). This is in common with the Early Mandarin of the Yuan Dynasty (c. 14th century AD) and with a number of modern southern varieties of Chinese. In Middle Chinese, syllables closed with a stop consonant had no tone; Chinese linguists, however, prefer to categorize such syllables as belonging to a separate tone class, traditionally called the \"entering tone\". Syllables closed with a glottal stop in Jin are still toneless, or alternatively, Jin can be said to still maintain the entering tone. (In standard Mandarin Chinese, syllables formerly ending with a glottal stop have been reassigned to one of the other tone classes in a seemingly random fashion.)\n\nJin employs extremely complex tone sandhi, or tone changes that occur when words are put together into phrases. The tone sandhi of Jin is notable in two ways among Chinese varieties:\n\nJin readily employs prefixes such as 圪 , 忽 , and 入 , in a variety of derivational constructions. For example:\n入鬼 \"fool around\" < 鬼 \"ghost, devil\"\n\nIn addition, there are a number of words in Jin that evolved, evidently, by splitting a mono-syllabic word into two, adding an 'l' in between (cf.

He has been awarded on numerous occasions for his work, and is nowadays a respected literary personality in the Basque Country.\n\nIn the early 80s, he was member of the Basque separatist group ETA. In 1985 he escaped from prison and since then he lived underground for decades while continuing to create and publish. In November 2016, it was revealed that he lives in Cuba, where he holds a position as lecturer at the University of Havana.\n\nHe earned a Basque Philology PhD from the University of Deusto, Bilbao and started working as a Basque language teacher. He taught phonetics in the Bergara center of the UNED and also in the Udako Euskal Unibertsitatea and wrote pieces for \"Zeruko Argia\", \"Anaitasuna\", \"Jakin\" and \"Oh Euzkadi\" magazines. He started the Pott Banda group along with Bernardo Atxaga, Manu Ertzilla, Ruper Ordorika, Jon Juaristi and Joxemari Iturralde. He also created the \"Ibaizabal\" magazine. He worked with short narrations and also translated books, notably Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\".\n\nIn 1980, while a member of ETA he was arrested by Spanish police and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Since then the realities of prison have appeared in his writings. In 1985 on San Fermin day (July 7) he escaped from prison with Iñaki Pikabea as there was a concert in the jail with Basque singer Imanol Larzabal. They hid themselves inside a loudspeaker. The Basque Radical Rock group Kortatu created the song \"Sarri, Sarri\" in honor of this. The escape was planned with theater critic Mikel Albisu, who would become the leader of ETA. During three months, the two fugitives and Antza were hiding in a flat in San Sebastián, before moving to France.\n\nSince that day he has lived in secret and the topic of banishment/exile is foremost in his writing. In his novel \"Lagun Izoztua\" (in Basque \"The Frozen Friend\") he writes about banishment. He has written books and poems which have been sung by different Basque singers as Jexuxmai Lopetegi, Mikel Laboa, Ruper Ordorika and Fermin Muguruza. There is also an audio book called \"Hau da ene ondasun guzia\" with his voice reading poems and many songs performed by different singers.\n\nOn 3 October 2011, he was awarded the Euskadi Prize for Essay in Basque for his work \"Moroak gara behelaino artean?\" (\"Are we Moors in the fog?\") on the miseries of colonialism; however, the Basque Government withheld the prize sum of 18,000 euros until the author's status was resolved. On the same day, judges and lawyers interviewed by Cadena SER confirmed that Sarrionandia could not be prosecuted by Spanish law, as more than 20 years had passed since his original prison sentence and his escape. While terrorist acts have no time limit, the provision applies only if there was at least one victim. After a month and a half, the Spanish High Court confirmed to the Basque government that Sarrionandia was 'clean', with no criminal or civil liability. The prize amount was handed over to his family.\n\nAccording to Spanish counter-terrorism sources, the writer has been hiding in Cuba. In 2014, he accepted the invitation of Mondragon University to give two lectures in Eskoriatza. It would have been his first public appearance since his escape in 1985. However, he cancelled the trip because he did not obtain the traveling permissions he needed. Even though the Cuban government has not acknowledged his presence, \"El Mundo\" reported in 2015 that Sarrionandia went to the Spanish consulate to regulate his status.\n\nBernardo Atxaga divided Sarrionandia's works in four distinct chronological phases. In the first phase, a young Sarrionandia wanted to be a part of Basque literature through a literary magazine. In the second phase, the imprisoned poet talked about suffering (\"La literatura y la revolución\"). In the third phase, after his escape, his themes were exile and homeland (\"Geografía\", \"He llegado a casa casi a medianoche\"). In the current phase, \"the brightest of them all,\" Sarrionandia is more serene, with a sense of humor and irony. Atxaga speculates on a fifth phase, based on the poem \"La vida ha llegado y tiene tus ojos,\" where the \"life that has arrived\" could be a child.\n\n\nHe has translated books by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\"), Constantine P. Cavafy, T. S. Eliot, Manuel Bandeira, Fernando Pessoa (\"Marinela\"), Marcel Schwob (\"La Croisade des enfants\"), Dolf Verroen (\"Slaaf kindje slaaf\") and various literary works of fifty different languages.\n\n\n"}

Centuries before the conquest, the Guna arrived in South America as part of a Chibchan migration moving east from Central America. At the time of the Spanish invasion, they were living in the region of Uraba and near the borders of what are now Antioquia and Caldas. Alonso de Ojeda and Vasco Núñez de Balboa explored the coast of Colombia in 1500 and 1501. They spent the most time in the Gulf of Urabá, where they made contact with the Guna.\n\nIn far Eastern Guna Yala, the community of New Caledonia is near the site where Scottish explorers tried, unsuccessfully, to establish a colony in the \"New World\". The bankruptcy of the expedition has been cited as one of the motivations of the 1707 Acts of Union.\n\nThere is a wide consensus regarding the migrations of Guna from Colombia and the Darien towards what is now Guna Yala. These migrations were caused partly by wars with the Catio people, but some sources contend that they were mostly due to bad treatment by the Spanish invaders. The Guna themselves attribute their migration to Guna Yala to conflicts with the native peoples, and their migration to the islands to the excessive mosquito populations on the mainland.\n\nDuring the first decades of the twentieth century, the Panamanian government attempted to suppress many of the traditional customs. This was bitterly resisted, culminating in a short-lived yet successful revolt in 1925 known as the Tule Revolution (or people revolution), led by Iguaibilikinya Nele Gantule of Ustupu and supported by American adventurer and part-time diplomat Richard Marsh - and a treaty in which the Panamanians agreed to give the Guna some degree of cultural autonomy.\n\nGuna language recognizes four vowel phonemes and 17 consonantal phonemes.\n\nVowels may be short or long.\n\nMost consonants may appear either as short (lax) or long (tense). The long consonants only appear intervocalically. However, they are not always a result of morpheme concatenation, and they often differ phonetically from the short analogue. For example, the long stop consonants p, t, and k are pronounced as voiceless, usually with longer duration than in English. The short counterparts are pronounced as voiced b, d, and g when they are between vowels or beside sonorant consonants m, n, l, r, y, or w (they are written using b, d, and g in the Guna alphabet). At the beginnings of words, the stops may be pronounced either as voiced or voiceless; and are usually pronounced as voiceless word-finally (Long consonants do not appear word-initially or word-finally). In an even more extreme case, the long s is pronounced [tʃ]. Underlyingly long consonants become short before another consonant. The letter \"w\" may be pronounced as either [v] or [w] depending on dialect and position.\n\nIn 2010, the National Guna Congress decided a spelling reform by which long consonants should be written with double letters. Equally the phonemes /p, t, k/ that may sound like [p, t, k] or [b, d, g] are represented by in all positions. Equally the old digraph becomes or depending on its morphological procedence (narassole [naraʧole] < naras + sole, godsa [koʧa] 'called' < godde 'to call' + -sa (past). So the reformed orthography uses only the fifteen letters for transcribing all the sounds of the language, with the digraphs for the tense consonants.\n\nThe alveolar /s/ becomes the postalveolar [ʃ] after /n/ or /t/.\nBoth long and short /k/ become [j] before another consonant.\n\nGuna is an agglutinative language which contains words of up to about 9 morphemes, although words of two or three morphemes are more common. Most of the morphological complexity is found in the verb, which contains suffixes of tense and aspect, plurals, negatives, position (sitting, standing, etc.) and various adverbials. The verb is not marked for person.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1418498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1418498", "title": "Left recursion", "text": "Left recursion\n\nIn the formal language theory of computer science, left recursion is a special case of recursion where a string is recognized as part of a language by the fact that it decomposes into a string from that same language (on the left) and a suffix (on the right). For instance, formula_1 can be recognized as a sum because it can be broken into formula_2, also a sum, and formula_3, a suitable suffix.\n\nIn terms of context-free grammar, a nonterminal is left-recursive if the leftmost symbol in one of its productions is itself (in the case of direct left recursion) or can be made itself by some sequence of substitutions (in the case of indirect left recursion).\n\nA grammar is left-recursive if and only if there exists a nonterminal symbol formula_4 that can derive to a sentential form with itself as the leftmost symbol. Symbolically,\nwhere formula_6 indicates the operation of making one or more substitutions, and formula_7 is any sequence of terminal and nonterminal symbols.\n\nDirect left recursion occurs when the definition can be satisfied with only one substitution. It requires a rule of the form\nwhere formula_7 is a sequence of nonterminals and terminals . For example, the rule\nis directly left-recursive. A left-to-right recursive descent parser for this rule might look like\n\nand such code would fall into infinite recursion when executed.\n\nIndirect left recursion occurs when the definition of left recursion is satisfied via several substitutions. It entails a set of rules following the pattern\nwhere formula_15 and formula_16 are any sequence of terminal and nonterminal symbols. Note that these sequences may be empty. The derivation\nthen gives formula_18 as leftmost in its final sentential form.\n\nLeft recursion often poses problems for parsers, either because it leads them into infinite recursion (as in the case of most top-down parsers) or because they expect rules in a normal form that forbids it (as in the case of many bottom-up parsers, including the CYK algorithm). Therefore, a grammar is often preprocessed to eliminate the left recursion.\n\nThe general algorithm to remove direct left recursion follows. Several improvements to this method have been made.\nFor a left-recursive nonterminal formula_4, discard any rules of the form formula_20 and consider those that remain:\nwhere:\nReplace these with two sets of productions, one set for formula_4:\nand another set for the fresh nonterminal formula_27 (often called the \"tail\" or the \"rest\"):\nRepeat this process until no direct left recursion remains.\n\nAs an example, consider the rule set\nThis could be rewritten to avoid left recursion as\n\nBy establishing a topological ordering on nonterminals, the above process can be extended to also eliminate indirect left recursion :\nNote that this algorithm is highly sensitive to the nonterminal ordering; optimizations often focus on choosing this ordering well.\n\nAlthough the above transformations preserve the language generated by a grammar, they may change the parse trees that witness strings' recognition. With suitable bookkeeping, tree rewriting can recover the originals, but if this step is omitted, the differences may change the semantics of a parse.\n\nAssociativity is particularly vulnerable; left-associative operators typically appear in right-associative-like arrangements under the new grammar. For example, starting with this grammar:\nthe standard transformations to remove left recursion yield the following:\n\nParsing the string \"1 - 2 - 3\" with the first grammar in an LALR parser (which can handle left-recursive grammars) would have resulted in the parse tree:\n\nThis parse tree groups the terms on the left, giving the correct semantics \"(1 - 2) - 3\".\n\nParsing with the second grammar gives\n\nwhich, properly interpreted, signifies \"1 + (-2 + (-3))\", also correct, but less faithful to the input and much harder to implement for some operators. Notice how terms to the right appear deeper in the tree, much as a right-recursive grammar would arrange them for \"1 - (2 - 3)\".\n\nA formal grammar that contains left recursion cannot be parsed by a LL(k)-parser or other naive recursive descent parser unless it is converted to a weakly equivalent right-recursive form. In contrast, left recursion is preferred for LALR parsers because it results in lower stack usage than right recursion. However, more sophisticated top-down parsers can implement general context-free grammars by use of curtailment. In 2006, Frost and Hafiz described an algorithm which accommodates ambiguous grammars with direct left-recursive production rules. That algorithm was extended to a complete parsing algorithm to accommodate indirect as well as direct left recursion in polynomial time, and to generate compact polynomial-size representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees for highly ambiguous grammars by Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan in 2007. The authors then implemented the algorithm as a set of parser combinators written in the Haskell programming language.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "827945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=827945", "title": "Romantic ballet", "text": "Romantic ballet\n\nThe Romantic ballet is defined primarily by an era in ballet in which the ideas of Romanticism in art and literature influenced the creation of ballets. The era occurred during the early to mid 19th century primarily at the Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique of the Paris Opera Ballet and Her Majesty's Theatre in London. It is typically considered to have begun with the 1827 début in Paris of the ballerina Marie Taglioni in the ballet \"La Sylphide\", and to have reached its zenith with the premiere of the divertissement \"Pas de Quatre\" staged by the Ballet Master Jules Perrot in London in 1845. The Romantic ballet had no immediate end, but rather a slow decline. Arthur Saint-Léon's 1870 ballet \"Coppélia\" is considered to be the last work of the Romantic Ballet.\n\nDuring this era, the development of pointework, although still at a fairly basic stage, profoundly affected people's perception of the ballerina. Many lithographs of the period show her virtually floating, poised only on the tip of a toe. This idea of weightlessness was capitalised on in ballets such as \"La Sylphide\" and \"Giselle\", and the famous leap apparently attempted by Carlotta Grisi in \"La Péri\".\n\nOther features which distinguished Romantic ballet were the separate identity of the scenarist or author from the choreographer, and the use of specially written music as opposed to a \"pastiche\" typical of the ballet of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The invention of gas lighting enabled gradual changes and enhanced the mysteriousness of many ballets with its softer gleam. Illusion became more diverse with wires and trap doors being widely used.\n\nThe Romantic era marked the rise of the ballerina as a central part of ballet, where previously men had dominated performances. There had always been admiration for superior dancers, but elevating ballerinas to the level of celebrity came into its own in the nineteenth century, especially as female performers became idealized and objectified. Marie Taglioni became the prototypical Romantic ballerina, praised highly for her lyricism. The movement style for Romantic ballerinas was characterized by soft, rounded arms and a forward tilt in the upper body. This gave the woman a flowery, willowy look. Leg movements became more elaborate due to the new tutu length and rising standards of technical proficiency. Important Romantic ballerinas included Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Lucille Grahn, Fanny Cerrito, Pauline Leroux and Fanny Elssler. The plots of many ballets were dominated by spirit women—sylphs, wilis, and ghosts, who enslaved the hearts and senses of mortal men and made it impossible for them to live happily in the real world.\n\nWhile ballerinas became increasingly virtuosic, male dancers became scarce, particularly in Paris (although they were still common in other European areas, such as Denmark). This led to the rise of the female travesty dancer - a female dancer who played male roles. While travesty dancing had existed prior to the romantic period it was generally used in tableau and walk-on (marcheuse) parts. Now it became a high-status occupation, and a number of prima ballerinas made their names by dancing \"en travestie\". Fanny Elssler and her sister both played travesty parts. The most well known travesty dancer was Eugénie Fiocre, who was the first dancer to play Frantz in \"Coppélia\", as well as a number of ballerina roles.\n\nThe costume for the Romantic ballerina was the romantic tutu. This was a full, white, multi-layered skirt made of tulle. The ballerina wore a white bodice with the tutu. In the second acts of Romantic ballets, representing the spiritual realm, the \"corps de ballet\" appeared on stage in Romantic tutus, giving rise to the term \"white act\" or ballet-blanc. The dancers wore pointe shoes to give the effect of floating. However, sometimes they decided to throw in extra sharp, sassy movements to portray the given concept or intent, often using high kicks and fast turns.\n\nRomantic ballet owed much to the new developments in theatre effects, particularly gas lighting. Candles had been previously used to light theatres, but gas lighting allowed for dimming effects and other subtleties. Combined with the effects of the Romantic tutu, ballerinas posing \"en pointe\", and the use of wires to make dancers \"fly,\" directors used gas lighting to create supernatural spectacles on stage.\n"}

Section 16 declares that English and French are the official languages of Canada and of the province of New Brunswick.\n\nUnder the heading \"Official Languages of Canada\", the section reads:\n\nThis section sets out general principles that are expanded in sections 16.1 to 22. Section 16 itself expands upon language rights in the \"Constitution Act, 1867\"; whereas section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" merely allowed for both languages to be used in Parliament and in the Quebec legislature, and in some courts, section 16 goes further by allowing bilingualism in the federal and New Brunswick bureaucracies, and in the New Brunswick legislature. This was not entirely new, as Canada's \"Official Languages Act\" had provided for this at the federal level since 1969, and New Brunswick had similar legislation. Those laws, however, were merely statutes, and section 16 thus made some of their key aspects into constitutional principles.\n\nIt has not been easy to understand how section 16 can be applied. In \"Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents\" (1986), Chief Justice Brian Dickson made reference to the \"academic debate about the precise significance of s. 16,\" and the question of \"Whether s. 16 is visionary, declaratory or substantive in nature.\" He did, however, decide that \"at the very least it provides a strong indicator of the purpose of the language guarantees in the Charter [ie., sections 17 to 22]... the federal government of Canada and the government of New Brunswick have demonstrated their commitment to official bilingualism within their respective jurisdictions.\" \n\nIn the same case, Justice Jean Beetz wrote that the political nature of section 16, as opposed to the generous nature of the rights in the rest of the Charter, indicate that courts should be cautious in interpreting section 16 in new ways. Elected governments would play a larger role in determining its scope. Justice Bertha Wilson went on to speculate that section 16 is meant to represent an opportunity for expansion of language rights. Thus, courts must always ask themselves how their rulings fit in with the current state of affairs regarding official languages policy, and how their rulings are consistent with it. While the rights guaranteed under another language provision of the \"Charter\", section 20, are limited, this does not mean that section 16 is limited or cannot have an effect on the growth of language rights. As far as New Brunswick is concerned, she added, bilingualism was considered \"crucial\" to \"social and cultural development,\" and thus there should be \"heightened public expectations\" that this could be supported by the \"Charter\".\n\nIn \"R. v. Beaulac\" (1999), the Supreme Court rejected some of its earlier conservative interpretations. It ruled that a purposive (generous) interpretation would be appropriate for language rights, since this would help minority language communities (i.e. those who speak English or French in a region where that language is the minority language) achieve equality.\n\nMany \"Charter\" cases regarding the use of the English and French languages have not been fought on the grounds of section 16. For example, Quebec's Bill 101, which limited the use of English, was considered to be invalid in certain respects not because it conflicted with section 16, but because it infringed freedom of expression, which is guaranteed by section 2 of the \"Charter\".\n\nLikewise, section 16 does not really apply to provinces besides New Brunswick; as the only province that currently considers itself to be officially bilingual, New Brunswick is the only province to have its bilingualism guaranteed by section 16. When Manitoba's laws declaring English to be the only official language of the province were found to be invalid in \"Re Manitoba Language Rights\" (1985), this was due to its contradictions with the \"Manitoba Act\".\n\nSubsection 16(3) provides that a Parliament or provincial government may strive for progress in official bilingualism. This reflects a 1975 court decision, \"Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick\", in which it was found governments may do this. Thus, the Supreme Court in \"Société des Acadiens\" has argued that it is the elected governments and \"political compromise\", rather than the courts, that will mostly advance language rights. \n\nJustice Wilson added that subsection 16(3) demonstrates that while language rights need to be improved, they should not be eroded once they have been established.\n\n"}

This is in contrast to strategic bombing, or attacking enemy cities and factories to cripple future military production and enemy civilians' will to support the war effort, in order to debilitate the enemy's long-term capacity to wage war. A tactical bomber is a bomber aircraft with an intended primary role of tactical bombing.\n\nTactical bombing is employed for two primary assignments. Aircraft providing close air support attack targets in nearby proximity to friendly ground forces, acting in direct support of the ground operations (as a \"flying artillery\"). Air interdiction, by contrast, attacks tactical targets that are distant from or otherwise not in contact with friendly units.\n\nTactical bombing was the first type of aerial bombing mission. It began in World War I when pilots dropped small bombs over the side of their open cockpits onto enemy troops below. One of the earliest examples of tactical bombing was at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915 when the Royal Flying Corps dropped bombs on German rail communications. By the time of World War II a number of specialized aircraft were developed to fulfill this role, including various fighter-bombers. During the Korean War tactical bombing missions were sometimes carried out by older piston-powered fighters such as the Vought F4U Corsair. In the Vietnam War, missions were frequently directed by forward air controllers (FACs) flying small propeller-driven planes. The FAC would mark targets with smoke, often in coordination with infantry on the ground. Bombers orbiting overhead would then fly in to hit the target. \n\nIn the modern era, precision-guided munitions (\"smart bombs\") can be directed with extreme accuracy.\n\n"}

{"id": "53887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53887", "title": "Text corpus", "text": "Text corpus\n\nIn linguistics, a corpus (plural \"corpora\") or text corpus is a large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and processed). In corpus linguistics, they are used to do statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a specific language territory.\n\nA corpus may contain texts in a single language (\"monolingual corpus\") or text data in multiple languages (\"multilingual corpus\").\n\nMultilingual corpora that have been specially formatted for side-by-side comparison are called \"aligned parallel corpora\". There are two main types of parallel corpora which contain texts in two languages. In a \"translation corpus\", the texts in one language are translations of texts in the other language. In a \"comparable corpus\", the texts are of the same kind and cover the same content, but they are not translations of each other. To exploit a parallel text, some kind of text alignment identifying equivalent text segments (phrases or sentences) is a prerequisite for analysis. Machine translation algorithms for translating between two languages are often trained using parallel fragments comprising a first language corpus and a second language corpus which is an element-for-element translation of the first language corpus.\n\nIn order to make the corpora more useful for doing linguistic research, they are often subjected to a process known as annotation. An example of annotating a corpus is part-of-speech tagging, or \"POS-tagging\", in which information about each word's part of speech (verb, noun, adjective, etc.) is added to the corpus in the form of \"tags\". Another example is indicating the lemma (base) form of each word. When the language of the corpus is not a working language of the researchers who use it, interlinear glossing is used to make the annotation bilingual.\n\nSome corpora have further \"structured\" levels of analysis applied. In particular, a number of smaller corpora may be fully parsed. Such corpora are usually called Treebanks or Parsed Corpora. The difficulty of ensuring that the entire corpus is completely and consistently annotated means that these corpora are usually smaller, containing around one to three million words. Other levels of linguistic structured analysis are possible, including annotations for morphology, semantics and pragmatics.\n\nCorpora are the main knowledge base in corpus linguistics. The analysis and processing of various types of corpora are also the subject of much work in computational linguistics, speech recognition and machine translation, where they are often used to create hidden Markov models for part of speech tagging and other purposes. Corpora and frequency lists derived from them are useful for language teaching. Corpora can be considered as a type of foreign language writing aid as the contextualised grammatical knowledge acquired by non-native language users through exposure to authentic texts in corpora allows learners to grasp the manner of sentence formation in the target language, enabling effective writing.\n\nText corpora are also used in the study of historical documents, for example in attempts to decipher ancient scripts, or in Biblical scholarship. Some archaeological corpora can be of such short duration that they provide a snapshot in time. One of the shortest corpora in time, may be the 15–30 year Amarna letters texts (1350 BC). The \"corpus\" of an ancient city, (for example the \"Kültepe Texts\" of Turkey), may go through a series of corpora, determined by their find site dates.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "655311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=655311", "title": "Urban sprawl", "text": "Urban sprawl\n\nUrban sprawl or suburban sprawl describes the expansion of human populations away from central urban areas into low-density, monofunctional and usually car-dependent communities, in a process called suburbanization. In addition to describing a particular form of urbanization, the term also relates to the social and environmental consequences associated with this development. In Continental Europe the term \"peri-urbanisation\" is often used to denote similar dynamics and phenomena, although the term urban sprawl is currently being used by the European Environment Agency. There is widespread disagreement about what constitutes sprawl and how to quantify it. For example, some commentators measure sprawl only with the average number of residential units per acre in a given area. But others associate it with decentralization (spread of population without a well-defined centre), discontinuity (leapfrog development, as defined below), segregation of uses, and so forth.\n\nThe term urban sprawl is highly politicized, and almost always has negative connotations. It is criticized for causing environmental degradation, and intensifying segregation and undermining the vitality of existing urban areas and attacked on aesthetic grounds. Due to the pejorative meaning of the term, few openly support urban sprawl as such. The term has become a rallying cry for managing urban growth.\n\nDefinitions of sprawl vary; researchers in the field acknowledge that the term lacks precision. Batty et al. defined sprawl as \"uncoordinated growth: the expansion of community without concern for its consequences, in short, unplanned, incremental urban growth which is often regarded unsustainable.\" Bhatta et al. wrote in 2010 that despite a dispute over the precise definition of sprawl there is a \"general consensus that urban sprawl is characterized by [an] unplanned and uneven pattern of growth, driven by multitude of processes and leading to inefficient resource utilization.\"\n\nReid Ewing has shown that sprawl has typically been characterized as urban developments exhibiting at least one of the following characteristics: low-density or single-use development, strip development, scattered development, and/or leapfrog development (areas of development interspersed with vacant land). He argued that a better way to identify sprawl was to use indicators rather than characteristics because this was a more flexible and less arbitrary method. He proposed using \"accessibility\" and \"functional open space\" as indicators. Ewing's approach has been criticized for assuming that sprawl is defined by negative characteristics.\n\nWhat constitutes sprawl may be considered a matter of degree and will always be somewhat subjective under many definitions of the term. Ewing has also argued that suburban development does not, per se constitute sprawl depending on the form it takes, although Gordon & Richardson have argued that the term is sometimes used synonymously with suburbanization in a pejorative way. \nMetropolitan Los Angeles for example, despite popular notions of being an sprawling city, is the densest metropolitan region in the US; Being denser than the New York metropolitan area and the San Francisco Bay Area. Essentially, most of metropolitan Los Angeles is built at more uniform low to moderate density, leading to a much higher overall density for the entire region. This is in contrast to cities such as New York, San Francisco or Chicago which have extremely compact, high density, cores but are surrounded by large areas of extremely low density. \n\nThe international cases of sprawl often draw into question the definition of the term and what conditions are necessary for urban growth to be considered sprawl. Metropolitan regions such Greater Mexico City, Delhi National Capital Region and Beijing, are often regarded as sprawling despite being relatively dense and mixed use.\n\nDespite the lack of a clear agreed upon description of what defines sprawl most definitions often associate the following characteristics with sprawl.\n\nThis refers to a situation where commercial, residential, institutional and industrial areas are separated from one another. Consequently, large tracts of land are devoted to a single use and are segregated from one another by open space, infrastructure, or other barriers. As a result, the places where people live, work, shop, and recreate are far from one another, usually to the extent that walking, transit use and bicycling are impractical, so all these activities generally require an automobile. The degree to which different land uses are mixed together is often used as an indicator of sprawl in studies of the subject.\n\nJob sprawl is another land use symptom of urban sprawl and car-dependent communities. It is defined as low-density, geographically spread-out patterns of employment, where the majority of jobs in a given metropolitan area are located outside of the main city's central business district (CBD), and increasingly in the suburban periphery. It is often the result of urban disinvestment, the geographic freedom of employment location allowed by predominantly car-dependent commuting patterns of many American suburbs, and many companies' desire to locate in low-density areas that are often more affordable and offer potential for expansion. Spatial mismatch is related to job sprawl and economic environmental justice. Spatial mismatch is defined as the situation where poor urban, predominantly minority citizens are left without easy access to entry-level jobs, as a result of increasing job sprawl and limited transportation options to facilitate a reverse commute to the suburbs.\n\nJob sprawl has been documented and measured in various ways. It has been shown to be a growing trend in America's metropolitan areas. The Brookings Institution has published multiple articles on the topic. In 2005, author Michael Stoll defined job sprawl simply as jobs located more than radius from the CBD, and measured the concept based on year 2000 U.S. Census data. Other ways of measuring the concept with more detailed rings around the CBD include a 2001 article by Edward Glaeser and Elizabeth Kneebone's 2009 article, which show that sprawling urban peripheries are gaining employment while areas closer to the CBD are losing jobs. These two authors used three geographic rings limited to a radius around the CBD: or less, 3 to , and 10 to . Kneebone's study showed the following nationwide breakdown for the largest metropolitan areas in 2006: 21.3% of jobs located in the inner ring, 33.6% of jobs in the 3-10 mile ring, and 45.1% in the 10-35 mile ring. This compares to the year 1998 - 23.3%, 34.2%, and 42.5% in those respective rings. The study shows CBD employment share shrinking, and job growth focused in the suburban and exurban outer metropolitan rings.\n\nSprawl is often characterized as consisting of low-density development. The exact definition of \"low density\" is arguable, but a common example is that of single family homes on large lots. Buildings usually have fewer stories and are spaced farther apart, separated by lawns, landscaping, roads or parking lots. Specific measurements of what constitutes low-density is culturally relative; for example, in the United States 2-4 houses per acre might be considered low-density while in the UK 8-12 would still be considered low-density. Because more automobiles are used much more land is designated for parking. The impact of low density development in many communities is that developed or \"urbanized\" land is increasing at a faster rate than the population is growing.\n\nOverall density is often lowered by \"leapfrog development\". This term refers to the relationship, or lack thereof, between subdivisions. Such developments are typically separated by large green belts, i.e. tracts of undeveloped land, resulting in an average density far lower even than the low density indicated by localized per-acre measurements. This is a 20th and 21st century phenomenon generated by the current custom of requiring a developer to provide subdivision infrastructure as a condition of development. Usually, the developer is required to set aside a certain percentage of the developed land for public use, including roads, parks and schools. In the past, when a local government built all the streets in a given location, the town could expand without interruption and with a coherent circulation system, because it had condemnation power. Private developers generally do not have such power (although they can sometimes find local governments willing to help), and often choose to develop on the tracts that happen to be for sale at the time they want to build, rather than pay extra or wait for a more appropriate location.\n\nLand for sprawl is often taken from fertile agricultural lands, which are often located immediately surrounding cities; the extent of modern sprawl has consumed a large amount of the most productive agricultural land, as well as forest, desert and other wilderness areas. In the United States the seller may avoid tax on profit by using a tax break exempting like-kind exchanges from capital gains tax; proceeds from the sale are used to purchase agricultural land elsewhere and the transaction is treated as a \"swap\" or trade of like assets and no tax is due. Thus urban sprawl is subsidized by the tax code. In China, land has been converted from rural to urban use in advance of demand, leading to vacant rural land intended for future development, and eventual urban sprawl.\n\nHousing subdivisions are large tracts of land consisting entirely of newly built residences. New Urbanist architectural firm Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company claim that housing subdivisions \"are sometimes called villages, towns, and neighbourhoods by their developers, which is misleading since those terms denote places that are not exclusively residential.\" They are also referred to as developments.\n\nSubdivisions often incorporate curved roads and cul-de-sacs. These subdivisions may offer only a few places to enter and exit the development, causing traffic to use high volume collector streets. All trips, no matter how short, must enter the collector road in a suburban system.\n\nBecause the advent of sprawl meant more land for lower costs, home owners had more land at their disposal, and the development of the residential lawn after the Second World War became commonplace in suburbs, notably, but not exclusively in North America. The creation in the early 20th century of country clubs and golf courses completed the rise of lawn culture in the United States. Lawns now take up a significant amount of land in suburban developments, contributing in no small part to sprawl.\n\nIn areas of sprawl, commercial use is generally segregated from other uses. In the U.S. and Canada, these often take the form of strip malls, which refer to collections of buildings sharing a common parking lot, usually built on a high-capacity roadway with commercial functions (i.e., a \"strip\"). Similar developments in the UK are called Retail Parks. Strip malls consisting mostly of big box stores or category killers are sometimes called \"power centers\" (U.S.). These developments tend to be low-density; the buildings are single-story and there is ample space for parking and access for delivery vehicles. This character is reflected in the spacious landscaping of the parking lots and walkways and clear signage of the retail establishments. Some strip malls are undergoing a transformation into Lifestyle centers; entailing investments in common areas and facilities (plazas, cafes) and shifting tenancy from daily goods to recreational shopping.\nAnother prominent form of retail development in areas characterized by sprawl is the shopping mall. Unlike the strip mall, this is usually composed of a single building surrounded by a parking lot that contains multiple shops, usually \"anchored\" by one or more department stores (Gruen and Smith 1960). The function and size is also distinct from the strip mall. The focus is almost exclusively on recreational shopping rather than daily goods. Shopping malls also tend to serve a wider (regional) public and require higher-order infrastructure such as highway access and can have floorspaces in excess of a million square feet (ca. 100,000 m²). Shopping malls are often detrimental to downtown shopping centres of nearby cities since the shopping malls act as a surrogate for the city centre (Crawford 1992). Some downtowns have responded to this challenge by building shopping centres of their own (Frieden and Sagelyn 1989).\n\nFast food chains are often built early in areas with low property values where the population is expected to boom and where large traffic is predicted, and set a precedent for future development. Eric Schlosser, in his book \"Fast Food Nation\", argues that fast food chains accelerate suburban sprawl and help set its tone with their expansive parking lots, flashy signs, and plastic architecture (65). Duany Plater Zyberk & Company believe that this reinforces a destructive pattern of growth in an endless quest to move away from the sprawl that only results in creating more of it.\n\nThe density gradient of industrialising cities has tended to follow a specific pattern: the density of the centre of the city would rise during urbanization and the population would remain heavily concentrated in the city centre with a rapid decline in settlement towards the periphery. Then, with continued economic growth and the expanding networks of public transport, people (particularly the middle class) would then slowly migrate towards the suburbs, gradually softening the population density gradient. This point was generally reached when the city reached a certain stage of economic development. In London, this point was reached in the first half of the 19th century, in Paris toward the end of the century and in New York City at the turn of the 20th.\n\nThe term \"urban sprawl\" was first used in an article in \"The Times\" in 1955 as a negative comment on the state of London's outskirts. However, London had been sprawling out of its medieval confines within the City since the 18th century, when the city experienced its first great urban surge. Areas to the west of Westminster were increasingly built up for the wealthy, to live in the suburbs of the city.\nA dramatic increase in the city's urban sprawl began in the 19th century, when labourers flocked from the countryside to work in the new factories that were then springing up. Large developments of small terraced houses began to appear and the new public transportation systems - (the metro, buses and trams) - allowed workers to commute into the city daily. Suburban districts also sprung up around the city centre to accommodate those who wanted to escape the squalid conditions of the industrial town.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the first major suburban areas were springing up around London as the city (then the largest in the world) became more overcrowded and unsanitary. A major catalyst in the growth in urban sprawl came from the opening of the Metropolitan Railway in the 1860s. The line joined the capital's financial heart in the City to what were to become the suburbs of Middlesex. Harrow was reached in 1880, and the line eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street and the centre of London.\n\nUnlike other railway companies, which were required to dispose of surplus land, the Met was allowed to retain such land that it believed was necessary for future railway use. Initially, the surplus land was managed by the Land Committee, and, from the 1880s, the land was developed and sold to domestic buyers in places like Willesden Park Estate, Cecil Park, near Pinner and at Wembley Park. In 1919, with the expectation of a postwar housing boom, Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited was formed and went on to develop estates at Kingsbury Garden Village near Neasden, Wembley Park, Cecil Park and Grange Estate at Pinner and the Cedars Estate at Rickmansworth and create places such as Harrow Garden Village.\n\nBy the early twentieth century then, amid increasing middle-class affluence, large low-density suburbs of semi-detached houses had sprung up all around the city, doubling the area of built-up London in the interwar period alone, despite the population increase being just 10 percent. H.G Wells even predicted in 1902 that within a hundred years most of southern England would have been subsumed into one gigantic conurbation centred in London.\n\nStarting in the early 20th century, environmentalist opposition to urban sprawl began to coalesce, with roots in the garden city movement, as well as pressure from campaign groups such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE).\n\nUnder Herbert Morrison's 1934 leadership of the London County Council, the first formal proposal was made by the Greater London Regional Planning Committee \"to provide a reserve supply of public open spaces and of recreational areas and to establish a green belt or girdle of open space\". It was again included in an advisory Greater London Plan prepared by Patrick Abercrombie in 1944. The Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 expressly incorporated green belts into all further national urban developments.\n\nNew provisions for compensation in the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act allowed local authorities around the country to incorporate green belt proposals in their first development plans. The codification of Green Belt policy and its extension to areas other than London came with the historic Circular 42/55 inviting local planning authorities to consider the establishment of Green Belts. The first urban growth boundary in the U.S. was in Fayette County, Kentucky in 1958.\n\nAccording to the National Resources Inventory (NRI), about 8,900 square kilometres (2.2 million acres) of land in the United States was developed between 1992 and 2002. Presently, the NRI classifies approximately 100,000 more square kilometres (40,000 square miles) (an area approximately the size of Kentucky) as developed than the Census Bureau classifies as urban. The difference in the NRI classification is that it includes rural development, which by definition cannot be considered to be \"urban\" sprawl. Currently, according to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.6 percent of the U.S. land area is urban. Approximately 0.8 percent of the nation's land is in the 37 urbanized areas with more than 1,000,000 population. In 2002, these 37 urbanized areas supported around 40% of the total American population.\n\nNonetheless, some urban areas like Detroit have expanded geographically even while losing population. But it was not just urbanized areas in the U.S. that lost population and sprawled substantially. According to data in \"Cities and Automobile Dependence\" by Kenworthy and Laube (1999), urbanized area population losses occurred while there was an expansion of sprawl between 1970 and 1990 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Brussels, Belgium; Copenhagen, Denmark; Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich, Germany; and Zurich, Switzerland, albeit without the dismantling of infrastructure that occurred in the United States.\n\nUrban sprawl is associated with a number of negative environmental outcomes.\n\nOne of the major environmental problems associated with sprawl is land loss, habitat loss and subsequent reduction in biodiversity. A review by Czech and colleagues finds that urbanization endangers more species and is more geographically ubiquitous in the mainland United States than any other human activity. Urban sprawl is disruptive to native flora & fauna and introduces invasive plants into their environments. Although the effects can be mitigated through careful maintenance of native vegetation, the process of ecological succession and public education, sprawl represents one of the primary threats to biodiversity.\n\nRegions with high birth rates and immigration are therefore faced with environmental problems due to unplanned urban growth and emerging megacities such as Kolkata.\n\nOther problems include:\nAt the same time, the urban cores of these and nearly all other major cities in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan that did not annex new territory experienced the related phenomena of falling household size and, particularly in the U.S., \"white flight\", sustaining population losses. This trend has slowed somewhat in recent years, as more people have regained an interest in urban living.\n\nDue to the larger area consumed by sprawling suburbs compared to urban neighborhoods, more farmland and wildlife habitats are displaced per resident. As forest cover is cleared and covered with impervious surfaces (concrete and asphalt) in the suburbs, rainfall is less effectively absorbed into the groundwater aquifers. This threatens both the quality and quantity of water supplies. Sprawl increases water pollution as rain water picks up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, and other pollutants in runoff from parking lots and roads.\n\nGordon & Richardson have argued that the conversion of agricultural land to urban use is not a problem due to the increasing efficiency of agricultural production; they argue that aggregate agricultural production is still more than sufficient to meet global food needs despite the expansion of urban land use.\n\nSprawl leads to increased driving, and increased driving leads to vehicle emissions that contribute to air pollution and its attendant negative impacts on human health. In addition, the reduced physical activity implied by increased automobile use has negative health consequences. Sprawl significantly predicts chronic medical conditions and health-related quality of life, but not mental health disorders. The American Journal of Public Health and the American Journal of Health Promotion, have both stated that there is a significant connection between sprawl, obesity, and hypertension.\n\nIn the years following World War II, when vehicle ownership was becoming widespread, public health officials recommended the health benefits of suburbs due to soot and industrial fumes in the city center. However, air in modern suburbs is not necessarily cleaner than air in urban neighborhoods. In fact, the most polluted air is on crowded highways, where people in suburbs tend to spend more time. On average, suburban residents generate more per capita pollution and carbon emissions than their urban counterparts because of their increased driving.\n\nA heavy reliance on automobiles increases traffic throughout the city as well as automobile crashes, pedestrian injuries, and air pollution.\nMotor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of five and twenty-four and is the leading accident-related cause for all age groups. Residents of more sprawling areas are generally at greater risk of dying in a car crash due to increased exposure to driving. Evidence indicates that pedestrians in sprawling areas are at higher risk than those in denser areas, although the relationship is less clear than for drivers and passengers in vehicles.\n\nResearch covered in the \"Journal of Economic Issues\" and \"State and Local Government Review\" shows a link between sprawl and emergency medical services response and fire department response delays.\n\nLiving in larger, more spread out spaces generally makes public services more expensive. Since car usage becomes endemic and public transport often becomes significantly more expensive, city planners are forced to build highway and parking infrastructure, which in turn decreases taxable land and revenue, and decreases the desirability of the area adjacent to such structures. Providing services such as water, sewers, and electricity is also more expensive per household in less dense areas.\n\nResidents of low-density areas spend a higher proportion of their income on transportation than residents of high density areas. The RAC estimates that the average cost of operating a car in the UK is £5,000 a year, most of which stems from financing costs and depreciation.\n\nUrban sprawl may be partly responsible for the decline in social capital in the United States. Compact neighborhoods can foster casual social interactions among neighbors, while sprawl creates barriers. Sprawl tends to replace public spaces with private spaces such as fenced-in backyards.\n\nCritics of sprawl maintain that sprawl erodes quality of life. Duany and Plater-Zyberk believe that in traditional neighborhoods the nearness of the workplace to retail and restaurant space that provides cafes and convenience stores with daytime customers is an essential component to the successful balance of urban life. Furthermore, they state that the closeness of the workplace to homes also gives people the option of walking or riding a bicycle to work or school and that without this kind of interaction between the different components of life the urban pattern quickly falls apart. James Howard Kunstler has argued that poor aesthetics in suburban environments make them \"places not worth caring about\", and that they lack a sense of history and identity. \n\nUrban sprawl has class and racial implications in many parts of the world; the relative homogeneity of many sprawl developments may reinforce class and racial divides through residential segregation.\n\nNumerous studies link increased population density with increased aggression. Some people believe that increased population density encourages crime and anti-social behavior. It is argued that human beings, while social animals, need significant amounts of social space or they become agitated and aggressive. However, the relationship between higher densities and increased social pathology has been largely discredited.\n\nAccording to Nancy Chin, a large number of effects of sprawl have been discussed in the academic literature in some detail; however, the most contentious issues can be reduced \"to an older set of arguments, between those advocating a planning approach and those advocating the efficiency of the market.\" Those who criticize sprawl tend to argue that sprawl creates more problems than it solves and should be more heavily regulated, while proponents argue that markets are producing the economically most efficient settlements possible in most situations, even if problems may exist. However, some market oriented commentators believe that the current patterns of sprawl are in fact the result of distortions of the free market. Chin cautions that there is a lack of \"reliable empirical evidence to support the arguments made either for or against sprawl.\" She mentions that the lack of a common definition, the need for more quantitative measures \"a broader view both in time and space, and greater comparison with alternative urban forms\" would be necessary to draw firmer conclusions and conduct more fruitful debates.\n\nArguments opposing urban sprawl include concrete effects such as health and environmental issues as well as abstract consequences including neighborhood vitality. American public policy analyst Randal O'Toole of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, has argued that sprawl, thanks to the automobile, gave rise to affordable suburban neighborhoods for middle class and lower class individuals, including non-whites. He notes that efforts to combat sprawl often result in subsidizing development in wealthier and whiter neighborhoods while condemning and demolishing poorer minority neighborhoods.\n\nThe American Institute of Architects and the American Planning Association recommend against sprawl and instead endorses smart, mixed-use development, including buildings in close proximity to one another that cut down on automobile use, save energy, and promote walkable, healthy, well-designed neighborhoods. The Sierra Club, the San Francisco Bay Area's Greenbelt Alliance, 1000 Friends of Oregon and counterpart organizations nationwide, and other environmental organizations oppose sprawl and support investment in existing communities. NumbersUSA, a national organization advocating immigration reduction, also opposes urban sprawl, and its executive director, Roy Beck, specializes in the study of this issue.\n\nOne of the primary debates around suburban sprawl is the extent to which sprawl is the result of consumer preference. Some, such as Peter Gordon, a professor of planning and economics at the University of Southern California's School of Urban Planning and Development, argue that most households have shown a clear preference for low-density living and that this is a fact that should not be ignored by planners. Gordon and his frequent collaborator, Harry Richardson have argued that \"The principle of consumer sovereignty has played a powerful role in the increase in America’s wealth and in the welfare of its citizens. Producers (including developers) have responded rapidly to households’ demands. It is a giant step backward to interfere with this effective process unless the benefits of intervention substantially exceed its cost.\" They argue that sprawl generates enough benefits for consumers that they continue to choose it as a form of development over alternative forms, as demonstrated by the continued focus on sprawl type developments by most developers. However, other academics such as Reid Ewing argue that while a large segment of people prefer suburban living that does not mean that sprawl itself is preferred by consumers, and that a large variety of suburban environments satisfy consumer demand, including areas that mitigate the worst effects of sprawl. Others, for example Kenneth T. Jackson have argued that since low-density housing is often (notably in the U.S.A.) subsidized in a variety of ways, consumers' professed preferences for this type of living may be over-stated.\n\nWhether urban sprawl does increase problems of automobile dependency and whether conversely, policies of smart growth can reduce them have been fiercely contested issues over several decades. An influential study in 1989 by Peter Newman and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia. The study has been criticised for its methodology but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.\n\nWithin cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and ex-urban residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income. This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection: people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour. More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.\n\nThose not opposed to low density development argue that traffic intensities tend to be less, traffic speeds faster and, as a result, ambient air pollution is lower. (See demographia's report.) Kansas City, Missouri is often cited as an example of ideal low-density development, with congestion below the mean and home prices below comparable Midwestern cities. Wendell Cox and Randal O'Toole are leading figures supporting lower density development.\n\nLongitudinal (time-lapse) studies of commute times in major metropolitan areas in the United States have shown that commute times decreased for the period 1969 to 1995 even though the geographic size of the city increased. Other studies suggest, however, that possible personal benefits from commute time savings have been at the expense of environmental costs in the form of longer average commute distances, rising vehicles-miles-traveled (VMT) per worker, and despite road expansions, worsening traffic congestion\n\nReviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour Melia et al. (2011) found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of smart growth measures to counteract urban sprawl. Planning policies that increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.\n\nThese findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states:\n\nThere is also some concern that anti-sprawl policies will increase housing prices. Some research suggests Oregon has had the largest housing affordability loss in the nation, but other research shows that Portland's price increases are comparable to other Western cities.\n\nIn Australia, it is claimed by some that housing affordability has hit \"crisis levels\" due to \"urban consolidation\" policies implemented by state governments. In Sydney, the ratio of the price of a house relative to income is 9:1. The issue has at times been debated between the major political parties.\n\nMany critics concede that sprawl produces some negative externalities; however there is some dispute about the most effective way to reduce these negative effects. Gordon & Richardson for example argue that the costs of building new public transit is disproportionate to the actual environmental or economic benefits, that land use restrictions will increase the cost of housing and restrict economic opportunity, that infill possibilities are too limited to make a major difference to the structure of American cities, and that the government would need to coerce most people to live in a way that they do not want to in order to substantially change the impact of sprawl. They argue that the property market should be deregulated to allow different people to live as they wish, while providing a framework of market based fees (such as emission fees, congestion charging or road pricing) to mitigate many of the problems associated with sprawl such as congestion and increased pollution.\n\nThe term 'smart growth' has been particularly used in North America. The terms 'compact city' or 'urban intensification' are often used to describe similar concepts in Europe and particularly the UK where it has influenced government policy and planning practice in recent years.\n\nThe state of Oregon enacted a law in 1973 limiting the area urban areas could occupy, through urban growth boundaries. As a result, Portland, the state's largest urban area, has become a leader in smart growth policies that seek to make urban areas more compact (they are called urban consolidation policies). After the creation of this boundary, the population density of the urbanized area increased somewhat (from 1,135 in 1970 to 1,290 per km² in 2000). While the growth boundary has not been tight enough to vastly increase density, the consensus is that the growth boundaries have protected great amounts of wild areas and farmland around the metro area.\n\nMany parts of the San Francisco Bay Area have also adopted urban growth boundaries; 25 of its cities and 5 of its counties have urban growth boundaries. Many of these were adopted with the support and advocacy of Greenbelt Alliance, a non-profit land conservation and urban planning organization.\n\nIn other areas, the design principles of District Regionalism and New Urbanism have been employed to combat urban sprawl. The concept of Circular flow land use management has been developed in Europe to reduce land take by urban sprawl through promoting inner-city and brownfield development.\n\nWhile cities such as Los Angeles are well known for sprawling suburbs, policies and public opinion are changing. Transit-oriented development, in which higher-density mixed-use areas are permitted or encouraged near transit stops is encouraging more compact development in certain areas-particularly those with light and heavy rail transit systems.\n\nBicycles are the preferred means of travel in many countries. Also, bicycles are permitted in public transit. Businesses in areas of some towns where bicycle use is high are thriving. Bicycles and transit are contributing in two important ways toward the success of businesses:\n\nWalkability is a measure of how friendly an area is to walking. Walkability has many health, environmental, and economic benefits. However, evaluating walkability is challenging because it requires the consideration of many subjective factors. Factors influencing walkability include the presence or absence and quality of footpaths, sidewalks or other pedestrian right-of-ways, traffic and road conditions, land use patterns, building accessibility, and safety, among others. Walkability is an important concept in sustainable urban design.\n\n\n\n"}
