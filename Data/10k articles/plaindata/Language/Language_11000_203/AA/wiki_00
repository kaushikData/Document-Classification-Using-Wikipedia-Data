It was founded in Mexico City on 11 September 1875 and, like the other academies, has the principal function of working to ensure the purity of the Spanish language. Academy members have included many of the leading figures in Mexican letters, including philologists, grammarians, philosophers, novelists, poets, historians and humanists.\n\nThe Academia Mexicana organized the first Congress of the Spanish Language Academies that was celebrated at Mexico City in April 1951. This gave birth, through its Permanent Commission, to the Association of Spanish Language Academies, confirmed in the second Congress, celebrated in Madrid five years later.\n\nAccording to its statutes, approved in the plenary session of 2 December 1931, and what is disposed in the text of constitution as a civil association, from 1952, the objectives of the Academy are as follows:\n\n\nTo achieve its objectives, the Academy takes abroad several studies and activities related to its competence, in plenary form as well as though its assigned especialized commissions.\n\nOriginally, the Academy was created with 12 members, but now has 36 full members \"(académicos de número)\" and 35 correspondent members \"(académicos correspondientes)\" based outside Mexico City. It may also have up to an additional five honorary members \"(académicos honorarios),\" who may be either Mexican citizens or foreigners.\n\nIt has a Board made up by a Director, a Secretary, a Censor, a Librarian-Archivist and a Treasurer, all chosen among the \"académicos de número\" by absolute majority of votes from the academics that attend the session in which they are to be elected, in secret voting.\n\nThe labour of the Academy is performed in a meeting, that celebrates its sessions twice or more monthly.The sessions are private or public, the first ones can be ordinary or extraordinary, and the public ones have the characteristic of solemnity when the Academy agrees it. The nature of the jobs that are analyzed and discussed in the heart of the meeting are of lexicographic, linguistic and literary importance.\n\nThe Academy owns a wide library. Its initial fund comes from the acquisition of the former library of the academic Don Alejandro Quijano. With the years the number of works with relevant contributions has been growing, such as the one of the prestigious jurist and intellectual Alberto Vázquez del Mercado (1893–1980), who bestowed the institution with a huge and valuable collection of historic and literary works. In addition the books published donated by the academics, there are to be found those sent by the Real Academia Española, the other Spanish-language academies, some publishing companies and book stores, as well as those sent by official and private cultural organizations.\n\nFrom its creation, the work of the academy has been documented with the publication of the Memories and a Yearbook.\n\nIn the Memories appear the works read by the members of the Academy in the meetings and others that, according to their judgement, are worth of publishing. Each volume starts with a review of the most relevant happenings that have occurred since the publication of the previous one and the indication of the number of attendance to the meetings of each academic, and concludes with general and alphabetic indexes.\n\nThe Academy publishes a Yearbook where it communicates the changes in academics and also all sort of works related to the institute.\n\nLikewise, it is concerned with the research of the use of the Spanish language in Mexico, which has crystallized in the publication of different works of reference. Among them, the most important are:\n\n\nBecause of its vocation of constantly adaptation with the new technologies and in harmony with the new communications society, the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua has included the forementioned works in its webpage so that they can be consulted in an interactive manner, belonging to the Association of Spanish Language Academies.\n\n\n"}

Gibbard has made major contributions to contemporary ethical theory, in particular metaethics, where he has developed a contemporary version of non-cognitivism. He has also published articles in the philosophy of language, metaphysics, and social choice theory.\n\nGibbard received his BA in mathematics from Swarthmore College in 1963 with minors in physics and philosophy. After teaching mathematics and physics in Ghana with the Peace Corps (1963–1965), Gibbard studied philosophy at Harvard University, participating in the seminar on social and political philosophy with John Rawls, Kenneth J.

In 1971 Gibbard earned his Ph.D., writing a dissertation under the direction of John Rawls.\n\nHe served as professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago (1969–1974), and the University of Pittsburgh (1974–1977), before joining the University of Michigan. Gibbard chaired the University of Michigan's Philosophy Department (1987–1988) and has held the title of Richard B. Brandt Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy since 1994.

He served as President of the Central Division of the American Philosophical Association from 2001 to 2002. He gave the Tanner Lectures at the University of California, Berkeley in 2006.\n\nSoon after his doctoral degree, Gibbard provided a first proof of a conjecture that strategic voting was an intrinsic feature of non-dictatorial voting systems with at least three choices, a conjecture of Michael Dummett and Robin Farquharson. Once established, this result has been known as the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem.\n\nGibbard is best known in philosophy for his contributions to ethical theory. He is the author of three books in this area. \"Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment\" (1990) develops a general theory of moral judgment and judgments of rationality. Gibbard argues that when we endorse someone's action, belief, or feeling as \"rational\" or warranted we are expressing acceptance of a system of norms that permits it. More narrowly, morality is about norms relating to the aptness of moral feelings (such as guilt and resentment).\n\nA recent review, including extensive citing of Gibbard's work above, is in the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" (2015). \nMore recently, Gibbard has written \"Meaning and Normativity\" (2012).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20558060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20558060", "title": "Baritenor", "text": "Baritenor\n\nBaritenor (also rendered in English language sources as bari-tenor or baritenore) is a portmanteau (blend) of the words \"baritone\" and \"tenor\". It is used to describe both baritone and tenor voices. In \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\" it is defined as \"a baritone singing voice with virtually a tenor range\". However, the term was defined in several late 19th century and early 20th century music dictionaries, such as \"The American History and Encyclopedia of Music\", as \"a low tenor voice, almost barytone\" [\"sic\"].\n\nBaritenor (or its Italian form, \"baritenore\") is still used today to describe a type of tenor voice which came to particular prominence in Rossini's operas. It is characterized by a dark, weighty lower octave and a ringing upper one but with sufficient agility for coloratura singing. Rossini used this type of voice to portray noble (and usually older), leading characters, often in contrast to the higher, lighter voices of the tenore di grazia or the tenore contraltino who portrayed the young, impetuous lovers. An example of this contrast can be found in his \"Otello\" (1816), where the role of Otello was written for a baritenore (Andrea Nozzari), while the role of Rodrigo, his young rival for the affections of Desdemona, was written for a tenore di grazia (Giovanni David). Nozzari and David were paired again in Rossini's \"Ricciardo e Zoraide\" (1818), with a similar contrast in characters – Nozzari sang the role of Agorante, King of Nubia, while David portrayed the Christian knight, Ricciardo. Other notable baritenors of this period beside Nozzari were Gaetano Crivelli, Nicola Tacchinardi, Manuel García Sr. and Domenico Donzelli\n\nThe Italian musicologist, Rodolfo Celletti (d. 2004), proposed that the Rossinian baritenor was nothing new to opera. According to Celletti, the tenor voices used for leading roles in early baroque operas such as Jacopo Peri's \"Euridice\" (1600) and Claudio Monteverdi's \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria\" (1640) were essentially \"baritenor\" ones with a range common to both the baritone and tenor voices of today. In his 2009 book, \"Tenor: History of a voice\", John Potter refers to this type of voice as \"tenor-bass\" and notes that several virtuoso singers of the 17th century who were described as \"tenors\" by their contemporaries could also sing in the bass register: Giulio Caccini, Giuseppino Cenci, Giovanni Domenico Puliaschi and Francesco Rasi. Rasi created the title tole in Monteverdi's first opera, \"L'Orfeo\" (1607), which in modern times has been sung by tenors such as Anthony Rolfe Johnson as well as by lyric baritones, such as Simon Keenlyside. Based on their descriptions in Vincenzo Giustiniani's \"Discorso sopra la musica\" (1628), Potter has suggested that singers such as Caccini, Cenci, Puliaschi, and Rasi, employed an \"open speech-like sound\" which facilitated the agility and clarity of expression for which their voices were renowned. \nWith the rise of the castrato singer in Italian opera, the baritenor voice came to be perceived as \"ordinary\" or even \"vulgar\" and was relegated to portraying character roles – villains, grotesques, old men, and even women. Although there were exceptions, such Dario in Vivaldi's \"L'incoronazione di Dario\" (created by the tenor Annibale Pio Fabri), the leading male roles (and especially that of the romantic lover) in Italian operas of the middle and late baroque era were largely written for the high, exotic voices of the castrati. In French opera of the same period, the baritenor voice, called the \"taille\" (or \"haute-taille\") before the term \"ténor\" came into general use, was little used for important solo parts, although possibly more often than in Italian opera. Because of the general dislike for the castrato voice in France, young lover roles were assigned to the high male voices of hautes-contre. Today the \"taille\" roles are most often performed by baritones.\n\nVocal pedagogues such as Richard Miller use the term to refer to a common voice category in young male singers whose tessitura (most comfortable vocal range) lies between that of a baritone and that of a tenor and whose passage zone lies between C and F. Such singers can evolve, either naturally or through training, into high baritones, suitable for operatic roles such as Pelléas in \"Pelléas et Mélisande\". Alternatively, they may evolve into spieltenors, suitable for character roles such as Pedrillo in \"The Abduction from the Seraglio\" or into \"heldentenors\" who sing leading roles such as Siegmund in \"Die Walküre\" or Florestan in \"Fidelio\". In both these types of tenor roles the highest notes of the tenor range are rarely required, and the voice usually has a baritonal weight in the lower notes. Several famous tenors who have sung the dramatic tenor and \"heldentenor\" repertory originally began their careers as baritones, including Jean de Reszke, Giovanni Zenatello, Renato Zanelli, Lauritz Melchior, Erik Schmedes, and Plácido Domingo, Towards the end of his career, Domingo returned to the baritone repertoire when he sang the title role in \"Simon Boccanegra\". Self-described as \"a bastard bari-tenor\", Walter Slezak (the son of operatic tenor Leo Slezak), was primarily a stage and film actor, but he also sang tenor roles in musicals and operettas and appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in 1959 as Zsupán in \"The Gypsy Baron\".\n\nDespite being described in \"Acting the Song: Performance Skills for the Musical Theatre\" as a term \"coined\" by \"musical theatre vernacular\", the use of \"baritenor\" in relation to the operatic voice can be seen in English sources since at least 1835, and French ones since 1829. Nevertheless, the term is widely used in musical theatre to describe a baritone voice capable of singing notes in the tenor range, and was used as early as 1950 to describe the voice of Eddie Fisher in a variety show at New York's Paramount Theatre. Deer and Dal Vera have noted that by 2008, the majority of leading roles in rock musicals were being written for baritenors. Amongst the roles specifying baritenor voices in casting calls between 2008 and 2010 were: Tom Collins (\"Rent\"), Bob and Tommy (\"Jersey Boys\"); Wizard, Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, and Tinman (\"The Wiz\"); Max Bialystock and Leopold Bloom (\"The Producers\"); and Thomas Weaver and Alvin Kelby (\"The Story of My Life\").\n\nSaltzman and Dési ascribe the rise of the baritenor voice in musical theatre to the introduction of amplification in the second half of the 20th century. Prior to that, the leading roles were predominantly sung by tenors and sopranos with even the baritone characters tending to sing in the upper part of their range. This was due not only to the popular taste of the times, but also to the fact that higher voices were more capable of riding over the orchestra and reaching the furthest seats. The introduction of amplification allowed male leading roles to be assigned to baritones, albeit ones who often had an extension into the tenor range. David Young also notes that the baritenor voice can be particularly useful for roles such as Marius in \"Fanny\" where the character ages significantly during the course of the musical.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29102236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29102236", "title": "Biodilution", "text": "Biodilution\n\nBiodilution, sometimes referred to as bloom dilution, is the decrease in concentration of an element or pollutant with an increase in trophic level. This effect is primarily observed during algal blooms whereby an increase in algal biomass reduces the concentration of pollutants in organisms higher up in the food chain, like zooplankton or daphnia.\n\nThe primary elements and pollutants of concern are heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium, and lead. These toxins have been shown to bioaccumulate up a food web. In some cases, metals, such as mercury, can biomagnify. This is a major concern since methylmercury, the most toxic mercury species, can be found in high concentrations in human-consumed fish and other aquatic organisms.\n\nNumerous studies have linked lower mercury concentrations in zooplankton found in eutrophic (nutrient-rich and highly productive) as compared to oligotrophic (low nutrient) aquatic environments. Nutrient enrichment (mainly phosphorus and nitrogen) reduce the input of mercury, and other heavy metals, into aquatic food webs through this biodilution effect. Primary producers, such as phytoplankton, uptake these heavy metals and accumulate them into their cells. The higher the population of phytoplankton, the less concentrated these pollutants will be in their cells. Once consumed by primary consumers, such as zooplankton, these phytoplankton-bound pollutants are incorporated into the consumer’s cells. Higher phytoplankton biomass means a lower concentration of pollutants accumulated by the zooplankton, and so on up the food web. This effect causes an overall dilution of the original concentration up the food web. That is, the concentration of a pollutant will be lower in the zooplankton than the phytoplankton in a high bloom condition.\n\nAlthough most biodilution studies have been on freshwater environments, biodilution has been shown to occur in the marine environment as well. The Northwater Polynya, located in Baffin Bay, was found to have a negative correlation of cadmium, lead, and nickel with an increase in trophic level Cadmium and lead are both non-essential metals that will compete for calcium within an organism, which is detrimental for organism growth.\n\nMost studies measure bioaccumulation and biodilution using the δ15N isotope of nitrogen. The δ15N isotopic signature is enriched up the food web. A predator will have a higher δ15N as compared to its prey. This trend allows the trophic position of an organism to be derived. Coupled to the concentration of a specific pollutant, such as mercury, the concentration verses trophic position can be accessed.\n\nWhile most heavy metals bioaccumulate, under certain conditions, heavy metals and organic pollutants have the potential to biodilute, making a higher organism less exposed to the toxin.\n"}

Calogero himself suggests that these findings, originally based on the simplified model of the universe \"are affected (and essentially, unaffected) by the possible presence in the mass of the Universe of a large component made up of particles much lighter than nucleons\".\n\nEssentially, the relation explained by Calogero can be expressed with the formulas:\n\nFurthermore:\nWhere:\n\nDespite its common description, it has been noted that the conjecture is not entirely defined within the realms of Nelson's stochastic mechanics, but can also be thought of as a means of inquiring into the statistical effects of interaction with distant masses in the universe and was expected by Calogero himself to be within the same order of magnitude as quantum mechanical effects.\n\nAfter the publication of Calogero's original paper, \"[The] [c]osmic origin of quantization\" a response was published by Giuseppe Gaeta of the University of Rome in which he discussed the compatibility of the conjecture with present bounds on variation of fundamental constants, but also outlined his focus on the modification of the relation between redshift and distance, and of the estimations attained from observations of elapsed time from the production of cosmic radiation and implications—both being related also, to the observed blackbody distribution of background cosmic radiation.\n\n"}

{"id": "1428218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1428218", "title": "Casting (performing arts)", "text": "Casting (performing arts)\n\nIn the performing arts industry such as theatre, film, or television, a casting (or casting call) is a pre-production process for selecting a certain type of actor, dancer, singer, or extra for a particular role or part in a script, screenplay, or teleplay. This process is typically utilized for a motion picture, television program, documentary, music video, play, or television advertisement, etc. This involvement in a dramatic production, advertisement, and or industrial video is intended for an audience, or studio audience.\n\nThe casting process involves a series of auditions before a casting panel, composed of individuals within a theatrical production such as theatrical producer, and theater director. However, within a given television production a casting panel can consist of a television producer, or within film production a casting panel could contain a film producer, film director, and/or choreographer. Usually, in nearly all areas of show business, a casting director is on this panel as well. In the early stages of this process performers often may present, or are presented with prepared \"audition pieces\" such as monologues, songs, choreography, scripts and or sides.\n\nThese audition pieces are usually video taped, typically in the form of screen tests and then attached with resumes, as well as head shots and or viewed online via websites such as IMDb, then shared with film producers, film directors and or studio executives. Later stages may involve groups of actors both union, (SAG-AFTRA) and non union depending on the size and scope of the production, attempting to read material from the work under consideration, paired off in various combinations of two, three or more. With each of the actor's overall motivational choices evaluated, the casting panel considers both the individual actor, and the \"chemistry\" created from either one of the combinations set forth within the read-through, such as boy meets girl, etc.\n\nWithin the production of a prestigious work under consideration for film or television, and depending on the difficulty in finding a lead or supporting actor for the role, such as with the casting of the biopic films Notorious, Straight Outta Compton and All Eyez on Me, casting calls may go out into the general public at large, this is referred to as a Cattle Call (typical for community theater), to professional and semi-professional local actors where a similar process is followed (for supporting roles in theater and film) or for specifically selected actors (for leading roles, especially in films).\n\nCasting character breakdowns, not to be confused with script breakdowns, are often provided by production agents who submit their clients to casting, which provides a brief summary of character (age, gender, race or ethnicity, situations they may be involved in). A more robust version of this painstaking task can be made through the Breakdown Services, which was founded by former actor Gary Marsh over 40 years ago. This was due to the difficult logistics issues for agents to get their actors submitted for acting roles from major film studios and casting directors.\n\nThis casting breakdown service provides a complete character breakdown of various scripts and projects from production companies for film, television, modeling, commercials etc., to only agencies and managers who meet certain criteria.\n\nThese agents and managers are positioned all over the world, and subscribe to this service that literally has an entire suite of services for just about every aspect of the breakdown, for a monthly service subscription fee. This suite includes services such as Breakdown Express, which offer representatives, casting and those who subscribe, a quicker way to post projects themselves. Another more limited version of the breakdown service, also for a monthly subscription fee is called Actors Access where acting can subscribe to what is only made available to them, more like an entry level acting position, like under-five, or a bit part, a great tool for the actor whom is without an agent or manager.\n\nAn actor may go through several casting calls before receiving a part, and even though well known actors or actresses oftentimes still go through this very necessary process, some are privileged enough to have well known writers, screenwriters and or directors /producers pitch a project for their intent to be cast in a role. The well known actor or actress oftentimes negotiates producer credit as well as very lucrative monetary compensation.\n\nIndependent casting studios like Film Independent who hosts the annual Independent Spirit Awards and the Los Angeles Film Festival are often utilized for casting calls so that auditions can take place in one location, as well as possible affiliated various locations saving valuable time, energy and money. \n\nFor some major productions, the process of selecting actors for sometimes hundreds of speaking parts and roles, may often require a specialized staff. While the last word remains with the people in charge such as the director, producer, artistic departments and overall production team, a casting director or \"CD\" (and sometimes the casting associate) is in charge of most of the daily work involved in this process during pre-production. A casting director is sometimes assisted by a casting associate; productions with large numbers of extras may have their own extras casting director as well, however in all aspects of a film or television production's budget, they are all a part of the above-the-line, answering to the director as part of his or her staff.\n\nThe \"CD\" remains as a liaison between director, actors and their agents/managers and the studio/network to get the characters in the script cast. Some casting directors build an impressive career working on numerous Hollywood productions such as Marion Dougherty, Mary Jo Slater, Mary Selway, Lynn Stalmaster, April Webster, Tammara Billik, Marci Liroff, Avy Kaufman, Mindy Marin, and Robi Reed.\n\nAt least in the early stages of casting and or extras casting such as with casting agency Central Casting, the process may be decentralized geographically, often in conjunction with actual shooting planned in different locations. Another reason may be tapping into each home market in the case of an international co-production. However, for the top parts, the choice of one or more beautiful people, whose presence is of enormous commercial importance, may rather follow strictly personal channels, e.g. direct contact with the director. During this time known as the \"attachment phase\" of a film, the casting director's job is to send out copies of the current script to agents for what is known as coverage. Coverage is when a script yet to be cast is read, summarized into a one-pager, and a brief set of character descriptions established. At this time, if an agency agrees to give coverage to a film, they will submit a list of ideas to the casting directors of actors available, capable, and in the price range of the film. Also, casting directors create their own idea lists and can \"check avails\" or call the actor representation to see if they are available and interested in taking on potential projects. If an idea that is generated from a casting director and a subsequent avail check or from an agent's recommendation is \"approved\" by the director, producers, and financiers (or studio), the casting director sends out what is called an \"Offer.\" The offer, usually contains a letter to the actor's representative explaining the role in question, a copy of the script, why the actor has been selected, the length of time commitment, the approximate start date of filming, the filming location, and the proposed salary offering. If the actor does not respond to the material or for whatever reason cannot accept the job, they respond to casting with what is called a \"pass.\" If they accept the offer, the agent engages the casting director and a deal memo is sent from casting to the representative. It is at this time when negotiations between agency and production happen to finalize any deal points before the entertainment lawyers step in and draw up the attachment contracts. If this process happens very early on in the development of a movie but the official shoot dates and details are not yet known, a Letter of Intent or \"LOI\" is drafted, to indicate, if and when the project is \"green lit\" or begins active production, the actor is already hired to portray that particular role. \n\nAfter the attachment phase is complete (which depends on many factors -- including but not limited to: financial backers, studio heads, availability of other above the line personnel), the physical auditions begin for all of the remaining roles. During this time, depending on the budget of the film, they could have what is called \"pre-screens\" where you audition only for a casting director (or associate) to see if the actor is right for the material. After pre-screens would be a \"director session\", during this time the actor comes in and auditions (usually with the same material) and now performs for the casting director and the film director. If there is a next step, it is usually a \"callback\" or producer session, where anyone who has decision making power is in the room for your audition. In television, this phase is referred to as a \"screen test\" and Network Executives would also be in attendance. Once actors are selected from the pool of available actors, the same booking process that happens in the attachment phase takes place for any actor except extras.\n\nThe resulting list of actors who were selected to play a character for a production, is called a cast list, which is incorporated into a production company's daily call sheet, and reflected in the projects title sequence especially with film and television.\n\nReaders: This person reads all other character's lines opposite the actor who is currently auditioning. A good reader is someone who has acting skills, but who has no interest in booking a role through that casting director's office at that time. A reader will know how to give and take and play with other actors without ever outshining the auditioning actors. \n\nInterns: Interns are more common to commercial casting offices which host as many as a dozen different casting directors holding different auditions per day. While some commercial casting offices hold permanent casting space, many rent out studios on a project to project basis. A key intern will work with many busy casting directors sorting mail, copying sides and transcribing them onto \"cue cards\" or large boards to be read off of as prompts in the casting room, help actors sign in, and keep the flow of actors going in and out of the casting room as smooth as possible.\n\nCasting Assistants: This is the entry level position in the field of casting. These people go above and beyond the call of duty of your typical office assistant. They do everything from covering phones, to making copies, setting up audition (aka \"session\") equipment like lights, the camera, sound equipment, etc. They sometimes can be found in the office relaying audition appointments, checking actors avails, or in the casting room making sure the recording software is running smoothly so the Casting Director can focus on each actor's performance. \n\nCasting Associates: Associates is the second chain of command in a casting office. Once a casting associate has worked for two years in the field of casting, they can apply for membership in Casting Society of America. Typically, the work under a Casting Director running pre-read sessions, prepping deal memos, and doing any calls to agents. Many associates begin to take on smaller scale projects so they can amass enough credits to move up in rank in CSA to a full-fledged Casting Director.\n\nCasting Director: Their job is to know a lot about a lot of actors, so that they can advise and present to the director the best of the existing possibilities. Casting directors are highly influential and is usually on the project because the director trusts their judgements. They are also the ones who decides who the director does see. Good casting directors \"discover\" actor by carefully setting it up so that the director and producer will feel as if they've made the discovery of the new young actor. On the occasion when the director or producer does not respond to the actor presented, they must keep in mind that they aren't directing the production, the director is the one who's going to have to work with that actor-- therefore, it is casting's responsibility to delicately balance between showcasing the actor available to them and the director and producer's sensibilities, tastes, and expectations.\n\nThe significant organization of professional screen, television, reality, and theater casting in the US is the Casting Society of America (CSA), but membership is optional. Casting directors organized in 2005 and became members of a collective bargaining unit, the Hollywood Teamsters Local 399 and New York Teamsters Local 817.\n\nThe highest honor a casting director can receive is awarded by their peers in the Casting Society of America. \"Artios\", comes from the Greek word meaning, \"perfectly fitted.\" The Artios award excellence in casting for all genres of casting except commercials. The Artios are currently held mid-January annually with ceremonies in New York, Los Angeles, and (beginning in 2018) London. Since their incarnation in 1985, they were held in November but were moved in 2013-2014 season to align with the rest of the film and television industry's awards season. The Artios is awarded to those CSA members who receive primary screen (or program) credit for casting on the winning project. Location Casting Directors, Casting Executives and Department Heads who are CSA members and who receive credit on winning projects also receive an Artios Award. CSA Associates on those projects are recognized in the press and with a certificate. \n\nThe Emmy Awards has a category for casting directors. As of 2017, Junie Lowry-Johnson has won the most casting Emmys as an individual, all in the drama category. She has six awards for her work on \"NYPD Blue\", \"Six Feet Under\", \"True Blood\" and \"Homeland\". The only shows to win casting Emmys three times were \"30 Rock\" and \"Veep\", both in the comedy category. In 2017, at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences introduced the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Reality Program.\n\n\n"}

Dolphins are also used to house navigation aids such as lights or daybeacons, and display regulatory information such as speed limits and other safety information, or advertising. \n\nThey are also used to protect structures from possible impact by ships, in a similar fashion to boating fenders. A notable example of dolphins used to protect a bridge is the Sunshine Skyway Bridge across the mouth of Tampa Bay. In 1980, a freighter hit a pier on one of the bridge's two, two-lane spans causing a section of the bridge to fall into the water, resulting in 35 deaths. When a replacement span was designed, a top priority was to prevent ships from colliding with the new bridge. The new bridge is protected by 36 dolphins: four large dolphins protecting the two main pylons supporting the cable-stayed main span plus 32 smaller dolphins protecting bridge piers for 1/4 mi (1/2 km) to either side of the main span. The cost of the dolphins was $41 million (approximately $90 million in 2017 dollars).\n\nDolphins typically consist of a number of piles driven into the seabed or riverbed, and connected above the water level to provide a platform or fixing point. The piles can be untreated azobé wood, pressure treated pine wood poles, or steel or reinforced concrete beams, blocks or tubes. Smaller dolphins can have the piles drawn together with wire rope, but larger dolphins are typically fixed using a reinforced concrete capping or a structural steel frame.\n\nAccess to a dolphin may be via a pedestrian bridge in the case of mooring dolphins, but is usually by boat.\n\n"}

{"id": "2105880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2105880", "title": "Fanagalo", "text": "Fanagalo\n\nFanagalo is a pidgin (simplified language) based primarily on Zulu, with English and a small Afrikaans input. It is used as a lingua franca, mainly in the gold, diamond, coal and copper mining industries in South Africa and to a lesser extent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Although it is used as a second language only, the number of speakers was estimated as \"several hundred thousand\" in 1975. Once the British left, English became the lingua franca enabling different tribes in the same country to communicate with each other, and Fanagalo use declined.\n\nFanagalo is the only Zulu-based pidgin language, and is a rare example of a pidgin based on an indigenous language rather than on the language of a colonising or trading power.\n\nThe variety in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) is known as Chilapalapa and is influenced by Shona, while the variety in Zambia (Northern Rhodesia), called Cikabanga (pronounced, and sometimes spelt, Chikabanga), is influenced by Bemba.\n\nThe name \"Fanagalo\" comes from strung-together Nguni forms fana-ga-lo meaning \"like + of + that\" and has the meaning \"do it like this\", reflecting its use as a language of instruction.\n\nOther spellings of the name are \"Fanakalo\" and \"Fanekolo\". It is also known as \"Isikula, Lololo\" or \"Isilololo, Piki\" or \"Isipiki\", and \"Silunguboi\". \n\nIn the Nguni tongues, the prefix \"Mu-\" or \"Ma-\" implies the singular, while \"Bu-\" or \"Ba-\" signifies the plural – hence \"Muntu\" = a man; \"Bantu\" = men, particularly when applied to tribes, e.g. \"Ma-tabele\". Similarly, the prefix \"Chi-\" or \"Si-\" indicates the language spoke by that tribe. e.g. men of the \"Lozi\" tribe are called \"Ba-rotse\", and they speak \"Si-lozi\"; Bembas speak Chiwemba; Tswanas live in Botswana, or as it used to be called, Bechuanaland.\n\nChi-lapa-lapa thus is the \"language\" derived from \"lapa\" = \"there\", with repetition for emphasis.\n\nFanagalo is one of a number of African pidgin languages that developed during the colonial period to promote ease of communication. suggests that it developed in the nineteenth century in KwaZulu-Natal Province as a way for English colonists to communicate with their servants and was also used as a lingua franca between English and Dutch/Afrikaans speaking colonists.\n\nFanagalo was used extensively in gold and diamond mines because the South African mining industry employed workers on fixed contracts from across southern and central Africa: including Congo, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique. With workers originating from a range of countries and having a vast range of different mother tongues, Fanagalo provided a simple way to communicate and is still used as a training and operating medium. Fifteen hours instruction was considered sufficient for an initiate to become reasonably fluent. See Witwatersrand Native Labour Association.\n\nAdendorff describes two variants of the language, Mine Fanagalo and Garden Fanagalo. The latter name refers to its use with servants in households. It was previously known as Kitchen Kaffir. (The term \"kaffir\" tended, in Southern Africa, to be used as a derogatory term for black people, and is now considered extremely offensive. It is derived from the Arab word Kafir, meaning unbeliever.)\n\nIn the mid-20th century in South Africa there were Government efforts to promote and standardise Fanagalo as a universal second language, under the name of \"Basic Bantu\".\n\nIn contrast, mining companies in the early 21st century have attempted to phase out Fanagalo in favour of the pre-existing, local languages. Ravyse (2018) discusses Fanagalo's apparent resistance to opposing official policy, in spite of its ongoing stigma as a language for the illiterate. Fanagalo has become intertwined with the culture of the mining industry, and its continuation seems to hinge on the ongoing favour of its speaking community, rather than industry policy. \n\nMining aside, Adendorff also suggests that Fanagalo has unfavourable and negative connotations for many South Africans. However, he raises the point that Fanagalo is sometimes used between white South Africans, particularly expatriates, as a signal of South African origin and a way of conveying solidarity in an informal manner. That role has of late largely been taken over by Afrikaans; even among English speaking South African expatriates.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, holiday makers from the Rhodesias often used to go on holiday to Lourenço Marques in Mozambique (now Maputo), where many people speak Portuguese – but most also spoke a form of Fanagalo.\n\nAll three languages are currently experiencing a revival in their popularity as a lingua franca, now freed from connotations of \"colonialism\" and valued for their intrinsic usefulness.\n\nRhodesian comedian Wrex Tarr was famous for routines that make extensive use of Chilapalapa.\n\nMine Fanagalo in South Africa and Zimbabwe is based mostly on Zulu vocabulary (about 70%), with English (about 25%) and some words from Afrikaans (5%). It does not have the range of Zulu inflections, and it tends to follow English word order. \n\nAdendorff describes Mine Fanagalo and Garden Fanagalo as being basically the same pidgin. He suggests that Garden Fanagalo should be seen as lying towards the English end of a continuum, and Mine Fanagalo closer to the Zulu end.\n\nSeveral key features differentiate Fanagalo from the Nguni languages (such as Zulu and Xhosa). \"Lo\" functions as both an article and a demonstrative, while only a demonstrative in Zulu. \"Lapha\" is used to mean \"here\", also meaning \"there\" when the first syllable is stressed, and is also used as a general preposition for location. (It works for anything such as \"on\", or \"near\", etc.) Zulu, on the other hand, only uses \"lapha\"to mean \"here\". Additionally, Fanagalo only uses free pronouns: \"mina\", \"tina\", \"wena\", \"ena\", meaning \"I, we, you, he/she/it/they\". Zulu only uses pronouns for emphasis, relying instead on verb agreement markers, much like Spanish. \n\nThe past tense of verbs is marked by the suffix \"-ile\" (\"hamba \"I go, go!\", \"hambile\" \"I went\"), and the future with the modal \"azi\" (\"azi hamba\" \"will go\").\"\n\nHere are two examples (all letters are pronounced):-\n\n\"Koki Lobin\"\nCock Robin\n\n\"Zonke nyoni lapa moyo ena kala, ena kala\"\nAll birds of air, they cried, they cried\n\"Ena izwile ena file lo nyoni Koki Lobin\"\nThey heard the death the bird Cock Robin\n\"Ena izwile, ena file, ena izwile ena file Cocky Lobin.\"\n\n\"Kubani ena bulalile Koki Lobin?\"\nWho they killed Cock Robin\n\"Mina kruma lo Sparrow\"\nMe, said the sparrow\n\"Na lo picannin bow and arrow kamina\"\nWith the little bow & arrow of mine\n\"Mina bulalile Koki Lobin.\"\nI killed Cock Robin\n\n\"TANDAZO\"\n\n\"Baba ga tina, Wena kona pezulu,\"\nFather of ours, You are above\n\" Tina bonga lo Gama ga wena; \"\nWe thank (for) the name of you\n\"Tina vuma lo mteto ga wena Lapa mhlaba, fana na pezulu.\"\n\"Niga tina namuhla lo zinkwa yena izwasisa;\"\nGive us today etc., etc... \n\"Futi, yekelela masono gatina,\"\n\"Loskati tina yekelela masono ga lomunye.\"\n\"Hayi letisa tina lapa lo cala; Kodwa, sindisa tina ku lo bubi,\"\n\"Ndaba Wena kona lo-mteto, lo mandla, na lo dumela, Zonkeskat.

As a consequence of this rule, all voiceless plosives which make part of a word-final consonant cluster are glottalized. This can be seen in the form \"looked\", with the underlying representation . It is pronounced . Another rule in English which is called fortis stop insertion shall be considered here as rule A. This rule inserts a voiceless plosive for example in (\"prince\"), so that the new form of the word becomes . Because a new phonological context has been created in which rule B can take place, the final output form of \"prince\" is . \n\nIf the order of rules which are in feeding order is reversed, this is said to be a counterfeeding order. \n\nIf we have two rules, rule A which looks like \"x → y\" and rule B which looks like \"y → z\" the following is a counterfeeding order:\n\nAn example of this can be seen in French, where \"petite nièce\" (\"little niece\") is pronounced . If the rule which deletes word-final in French had been applied before another rule which deletes word-final consonants before another consonant, this would have been an example of feeding order and the \"final output\" form (surface form) would have been instead. \n\nA counter-feeding order very often creates phonological opacity. In the given case, it is the application of the rule deleting word-final consonants which has thus become opaque in French.\n\nIn historical linguistics, a sequence of rules in counterfeeding order is called a chain shift. A chain shift can be presented graphically like the following:\nwhere only one rule can apply. The result is that what was originally \"a\" becomes \"b\", what was originally \"b\" becomes \"c\", what was originally \"c\" becomes \"d\", etc. In essence, each sound \"shifts\" one position to the right. A good example of such a chain shift occurred as part of the Great Vowel Shift, which took place historically in English around 1500 AD. The long front vowels were raised one position, while the original high front vowel became a diphthong:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25443196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25443196", "title": "Ferdinand Ebner", "text": "Ferdinand Ebner\n\nFerdinand Ebner (January 31, 1882 in Wiener Neustadt – October 17, 1931 in Gablitz, Austria), was an Austrian elementary school teacher and philosopher. Together with Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig, he is considered one of the most outstanding representatives of dialogical thinking. Ebner's philosophy is about man existing in a I-Thou personal relationship with God and with others. His thought has similarities with the Christian existentialism of Gabriel Marcel. On the basis of the unity of I and Thou, which has in language (in the spoken word), and in love its expressions, Ebner developed a religiously informed philosophy of language which led to his practical-ethical understanding of the Christian faith as the basis for the personal fulfillment and the whole social progress.\n\nIn 1897, after finishing school, Ebner entered the Teachers' Training College in Wiener Neustadt. In 1900 a lung disease obliged him to interrupt his courses. He had to spend four weeks in a health resort in Gleichenberg and then five months in a lung sanatorium in Alland. His sister Josephine had died of tuberculosis, just one year after her marriage. The young student felt ill and depressed. After one year interruption Ebner completed his study at the Teachers´ Training College in 1902 with best qualifications. After ten years in Waldegg, in 1912 his job took Ebner to Gablitz near Vienna, from where he could again take refuge in the Viennese cultural scene. He spent whole days visiting Vienna's churches, museums, concert halls, theaters and coffee houses. There, he discussed with friends and acquaintances, and immersed himself for hours in \"Die Fackel\" and the \"Brenner\".\n\nEbner dealt all his life with philosophical and religious issues. He was a great reader: literature, philosophy, psychology. He read Otto Weininger's \"Sex and Character\", later Pascal, Arthur Schopenhauer, Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, to name a few. His first philosophical work \"Ethic and Life: fragments of a metaphysics of individual existence\" (1913-1914) remained unpublished until 2013. His major work is \"The Word and the spiritual Realities: Pneumatological Fragments\". It was published by Ludwig von Ficker´s Brenner-Verlag in 1921. He published a few more articles in Ficker´s Brenner Review. Ludwig von Ficker remained until Ebner´s death one of his best friends.\n\nIn 1923 Ebner became reluctantly the head of the school, but he had to retire soon due to further illnesses and depressions, which led him to two suicide attempts. After his stay at the sanatorium Burg Hartenstein, he married his colleague Maria Mizera. They had a son, Walter Ebner. Ebner died of tuberculosis in Gablitz, where he is buried, in 1931. Before dying he had time to finish his important work \"Aphorismen 1931\".\n\nEbner's estate is located in the Brenner-Archiv in Innsbruck.\n\nEbner´s work has had an important influence in many fields of the human knowledge and in the modern comprehension of the Christian faith. As Moltmann said in his \"Theology of Hope\", Ebner used Pascal´s and Kierkegaard´s thought to talk about \"the breaking through of the eternity in the present\" (\"Schriften\" I, 259, 912). In so doing Ebner wanted to point out the importance of prayer and of man´s decision of religious faith. But Ebner did not stop there and went on to affirm the God of the resurrection of Jesus Christ (I,568; II, 625), the God of the \"promised salvation\", of the \"divine promise\" (I,432,447,610), of \"the Kingdom of God\" (I, 609), so that in our faith in Jesus Christ rests our Christian \"legitimate hope in the future\" (I,568). Jesus Christ is for Ebner, as the Gospel says, \"the light of the world\" (I,570) until the complete lightness when he returns, until \"the Second Coming\" (I,302-303). Man´s responsibility and task is \"to help establish the Kingdom of God\" (I,573: \"die Herrschaft Gottes aufrichten zu helfen\"). Ebner´s personalism and religious thought has influenced both the Protestant and the catholic world, from E. Brunner, D. Bonhöffer and Jürgen Moltmann to K. Rahner, H. Küng and J. Ratzinger.\n\nDuring the tragic events of the first World War, Ebner tried to understand \"the signs of the times\" (\"Mat\" 16,3) to grasp the meaning of human life and human history. \"Dreaming about the spirit\" as often men do was not the right answer. In the I-solitude (Icheinsamkeit)without a real relationship with God, our Thou, we dream of the spirit in the different cultural expressions. But when the right I-Thou encounter takes place we do not separate theory and praxis anymore, because we are able to understand Matthew 25,40: \"as you did this to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it to me\". (I,268). Living in a real, true relationship with God and our neighbour means waking up to the \"spiritual realities\", the end of our just \"dreaming of the spirit\". So can men be creative and work for a better society without forgetting justice and solidarity, the brother in need.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "76440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76440", "title": "Fourth wall", "text": "Fourth wall\n\nThe fourth wall is a performance convention in which an invisible, imagined wall separates actors from the audience. While the audience can see through this \"wall\", the convention assumes, the actors act as if they cannot. From the 16th century onwards, the rise of illusionism in staging practices, which culminated in the realism and naturalism of the theatre of the 19th century, led to the development of the fourth wall concept.\n\nThe metaphor suggests a relationship to the mise-en-scène behind a proscenium arch. When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage, in what is known as a box set, the \"fourth\" of them would run along the line (technically called the \"proscenium\") dividing the room from the auditorium. The \"fourth wall\", though, is a theatrical convention, rather than of set design. The actors ignore the audience, focus their attention exclusively on the dramatic world, and remain absorbed in its fiction, in a state that the theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski called \"public solitude\" (the ability to behave as one would in private, despite, in actuality, being watched intently while so doing, or to be 'alone in public'). In this way, the fourth wall exists regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set, or the physical arrangement of the theatre building or performance space, or the actors' distance from or proximity to the audience.\n\n\"Breaking the fourth wall\" is any instance in which this performance convention, having been adopted more generally in the drama, is violated. This can be done through either directly referencing the audience, the play as a play, or the characters' fictionality. The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance. This act of drawing attention to a play's performance conventions is metatheatrical. A similar effect of metareference is achieved when the performance convention of avoiding direct contact with the camera, generally used by actors in a television drama or film, is temporarily suspended. The phrase \"breaking the fourth wall\" is used to describe such effects in those media. Breaking the fourth wall is also possible in other media, such as video games and books.\n\nThe concept is usually attributed to the philosopher, critic and dramatist Denis Diderot. The term itself was used by Molière.\nThe presence of the fourth wall is an established convention of modern realistic theatre, which has led some artists to draw direct attention to it for dramatic or comic effect when a boundary is \"broken\", when an actor or character addresses the audience directly. Breaking the fourth wall is common in pantomime and children's theatre where, for example, a character might ask the children for help, as when Peter Pan appeals to the audience to applaud in an effort to revive the fading Tinker Bell (\"If you believe in fairies, clap your hands!\"). Many Shakespearian plays use this technique for comic effect.\n\nThe acceptance of the transparency of the fourth wall is part of the suspension of disbelief between a work of fiction and an audience, allowing them to enjoy the fiction as though they were observing real events. Critic Vincent Canby described it in 1987 as \"that invisible scrim that forever separates the audience from the stage\".\n\nThe earliest recorded breaking of the fourth wall in serious cinema was in Mary MacLane's revolutionary 1918 silent film \"Men Who Have Made Love to Me\", in which the enigmatic authoress - who portrays herself - interrupts the vignettes onscreen to address the audience directly.\n\nOliver Hardy was one of the first notable examples of breaking the fourth wall in his movies with Stan Laurel, when he would often stare directly at the camera to seek sympathy from viewers. Groucho Marx spoke directly to the audience in \"Animal Crackers\" (1930), and \"Horse Feathers\" (1932), in the later film advising them to \"go out to the lobby\" during Chico Marx's piano interlude. Comedy films by Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker frequently broke the fourth wall in some, such that with these films, \"the fourth wall is so flimsy and so frequently shattered that it might as well not exist\", according to \"The A.V. Club\". \n\nBreaking the fourth wall is an integral part of the ending of Alejandro Jodorowsky's 1973 film \"The Holy Mountain\". In the Mel Brooks film \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974), the characters literally break the fourth wall. Woody Allen broke the fourth wall several times in his movie \"Annie Hall\" (1977), as he explained, \"because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them.\" His 1985 film The Purple Rose of Cairo features the breaking of the fourth wall as a central plot point. The John Hughes movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (1986), is another well-known fourth-wall-breaking movie. Bueller, played by Matthew Broderick, often turns to the camera and breaks character to tell his thought process or explain his reasoning. Another Chicago area fourth-wall-breaking film, \"High Fidelity\", has John Cusack's character Rob intimately sharing his life struggles and confessions with the audience. Two more recent examples are the 2016 film \"Deadpool\", in which it is used as a comic device between the main character and the audience and the 2017 film \"I, Tonya\", where Tonya Harding and the other characters tell a first person story of Tonya's life as a black comedy.\n\nJerry Lewis wrote in his 1971 book \"The Total Filmmaker\", “Some film-makers believe you should never have an actor look directly into the camera. They maintain it makes the audience uneasy, and interrupts the screen story. I think that is nonsense, and usually I have my actors, in a single, look direct into the camera at least once in a film, if a point is to be served.” Martin and Lewis look directly at the audience in \"You’re Never Too Young\" (1955), and Lewis and co-star Stella Stevens each look directly into the camera several times in \"The Nutty Professor\" (1963), and Lewis’ character holds a pantomime conversation with the audience in \"The Disorderly Orderly\" (1964). The final scene of \"The Patsy\" (1964) is famous for revealing to the audience the movie as a movie, and Lewis as actor/director.\n\nOn television, breaking the fourth wall has been done throughout the history of the medium. George Burns did it numerous times on \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\", where he starred in with his real-life wife Gracie Allen from 1950 to 1958. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis routinely broke the fourth wall in their 1950 to 1955 \"Colgate Comedy Hour\" sketches. \"It's Garry Shandling's Show\" and \"Mrs. Brown's Boys\" both have their title character walking between sets mid-scene, and the latter occasionally shows characters retaking fluffed lines. Another television character who regularly breaks the fourth wall is Francis Urquhart in the British TV drama series \"House of Cards\", \"To Play the King\" and \"The Final Cut\". Urquhart addresses the audience several times during each episode, giving the viewer comments on his own actions on the show. The same technique is also used, though less frequently, in the American adaptation of \"House of Cards\" by main character Frank Underwood and by his wife Claire.\n\nThe main character in \"Clarissa Explains It All\" addresses the audience at least once each episode.\n\nZack Morris frequently addresses the audience at the beginning and end of nearly every episode of \"Saved by the Bell\".\n\nDobie Gillis, near a statue of The Thinker addresses the audience at the beginning and end of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.\n\nDuring the 12th season of \"Dallas\", Sue Ellen Ewing collaborates with a screenplay writer to retell the events that occurred in earlier episodes of the series.\n\nIn the \"War and Peace\" episode of the second season of \"Northern Exposure\", Joel Fleischman defuses a crisis by announcing that the viewers would not accept either of the two possible outcomes of a particular scene in which a duel is about to take place, and the other characters agree to move on to the episode's next scene.\n\nOn the 1977-1984 sitcom, \"Three's Company\", and later on the 1979-1980 sitcom, \"The Ropers\", the husband character Stanley Roper (played by Norman Fell) would frequently break the fourth wall in a subtle manner, by turning to look at the camera while laughing after ridiculing his wife Helen, played by Audra Lindley. A similar technique was often used in British television series \"Hustle\", with characters winking or smiling knowingly at the camera at key points in the action.\n\nThe 2001–2006 Fox sitcom \"The Bernie Mac Show\" had the lead character Bernie Mac breaking the fourth wall talking to \"America\".\nThe convention of breaking the fourth wall is often seen on mockumentary sitcoms, including \"The Office\". Mockumentary shows which break the fourth wall poke fun at the documentary genre with the intention of increasing the satiric tone of the show. Characters in \"The Office\" directly speak to the audience during interview sequences. Characters are removed from the rest of the group to speak and reflect on their experiences. When this occurs, the rules of an impersonal documentary are shattered. The person behind the camera, the interviewer, is also referenced when the characters gaze and speak straight to the camera. The interviewer, however, is only indirectly spoken to and remains hidden. This technique, when used in shows with complex genres, serves to heighten the comic tone of the show while also proving that the camera itself is far from a passive onlooker.\n\nSeveral Nick Jr. shows such as \"Blue's Clues\", \"Team Umizoomi\", and \"Dora the Explorer\" as well as a few non-Nick Jr. cartoons had characters talking to the child watching the show and encouraging them to participate in the story, some shows used a child viewer voice calling the answer while some shows didn't use a voice at all, some of their shows though, such as the shows they distribute from Nelvana Limited, don't use the fourth wall breaks.\n\nThe Netflix series \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\", based on the Daniel Handler's book series of the same name, incorporates some of the narrative elements from the books by having Lemony Snicket as a narrator character (played by Patrick Warburton) speaking directly to the television viewer that frequently breaks the fourth wall to explain various literary wordplay that was included in the books.\n\nGiven their interactive nature, nearly all video games break the fourth wall by asking for the player's participation. But beyond the obvious ways in which video games break the fourth wall (e.g. by having UI elements on the screen, etc.), there are several other ways that games have done this. These can include having the character face the direction of the player/screen, having a self-aware character that recognizes that they are in a video game, or having secret or bonus content set outside the game's narrative that can either extend the game world (such as with the use of false documents) or provide \"behind the scenes\" type content. But since video games are inherently much more interactive than traditional films and literature, defining what truly breaks the fourth wall in the video game medium becomes difficult.\n\nSteven Conway, writing for \"Gamasutra\", suggests that in video games, many purported examples of breaking the fourth wall are actually better understood as \"relocations\" of the fourth wall or expansions of the \"magic circle\" (the fictional game world) to encompass the player. This is in contrast to traditional fourth wall breaks, which break the audience's illusion or suspension of disbelief, by acknowledging them directly. Conway argues that this expansion of the magic circle in video games actually serves to more fully immerse a player into the fictional world rather than take the viewer out of the fictional world, as is more common in traditional fourth wall breaks. An example of this expansion of the magic circle can be found in the game \"\", in which the player receives an in-game email at their real-life email address and must visit out-of-game websites to solve some of the puzzles in the game. Other games may expand the magic circle to include the game's hardware. For example, \"X-Men\" for the Mega Drive/Genesis required players to reset their game console at a certain point to reset the X-Men's in-game Hazard Room, while \"Metal Gear Solid\" asked the player to put the DualShock controller on their neck to simulate a back massage being given in-game.\n\nOther examples include the idle animation of Sonic the Hedgehog in his games where the on-screen character would look to the player and tap his foot impatiently if left alone for a while, and one level of \"Max Payne\" has the eponymous character come to the realization they are in a video game, and narrate what the player sees as part of the UI. \"Eternal Darkness\", which included a sanity meter, would simulate various common computer glitches to the player as the sanity meter drained, including the Blue Screen of Death. The Stanley Parable is also a well known example of this, as the narrator from the game constantly tries to reason with the player, even going so far as to beg the player to switch off the game at one point.\n\nThe method of breaking the fourth wall in literature is typically referred to as metafiction. Metafiction genre occurs when a character within a literary work acknowledges the reality that they are in fact a fictitious being. The use of the fourth wall in literature can be traced back as far as \"The Canterbury Tales\" and \"Don Quixote\". However, it was popularized in the early 20 century during the Post-Modern literary movement. Artists like Virginia Woolf in \"To the Lighthouse\" and Kurt Vonnegut in \"Breakfast of Champions\" used the genre to question the accepted knowledge and sources of the culture. The use of metafiction or breaking the fourth wall in literature varies from that on stage in that the experience is not communal but personal to the reader and develops a self-consciousness within the character/reader relationship that works to build trust and expand thought. This does not involve acknowledgment of a character’s fictive nature. Breaking the fourth wall in literature is not always metafiction. Modern examples of breaking the fourth wall include Ada Palmer’s \"Terra Ignota\" and William Goldman’s \"The Princess Bride\".\n\n\n"}

However, only a very small proportion of English words show such variations. In the case of allophones, however, free variation is exceedingly common and, along with differing intonation patterns, variation in allophony is the most important single feature in the characterization of regional accents.\n\nEnglish's deep orthography and the language's wide variety of accents often cause confusion, even for native speakers, on how written words should be pronounced. That allows for a significant degree of free variation to occur in English.\n\n"}

{"id": "163005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163005", "title": "Genlock", "text": "Genlock\n\nGenlock (generator locking) is a common technique where the video output of one source, or a specific reference signal from a signal generator, is used to synchronize other picture sources together. The aim in video applications is to ensure the coincidence of signals in time at a combining or switching point. When video instruments are synchronized in this way, they are said to be \"generator-locked\", or \"genlocked\".\n\nVideo signals generated and output by generator-locked instruments are said to be syntonized. Syntonized video signals will be precisely frequency-locked, but because of delays caused by the unequal transmission path lengths, the synchronized signals will exhibit differing phases at various points in the television system. Modern video equipment such as production switchers that have multiple video inputs often include a variable delay on each input to compensate for the phase differences and time all the input signals to precise phase coincidence.\n\nWhere two or more video signals are combined or being switched between, the horizontal and vertical timing of the picture sources should be coincident with each other. If they are not, the picture will appear to jump when switching between the sources whilst the display device re-adjusts the horizontal and/or vertical scan to correctly reframe the image.\n\nWhere composite video is in use, the phase of the chrominance subcarrier of each source being combined or switched should also be coincident. This is to avoid changes in colour hue and/or saturation during a transition between sources.\n\nGenerator locking can be used to synchronize as few as two isolated sources (e.g., a television camera and a videotape machine feeding a vision mixer (production switcher)), or in a wider facility where all the video sources are locked to a single synchronizing pulse generator (e.g., a fast-paced sporting event featuring multiple cameras and recording devices). Generator locking can also be used to ensure that multiple CRT monitors that appear in a movie are flicker-free. Generator locking is also used to synchronize two cameras for Stereoscopic 3D video recording.\n\nIn broadcast systems, an analog generator-lock signal usually consists of vertical and horizontal synchronizing pulses together with chrominance phase reference in the form of colorburst. No picture information is usually carried to avoid disturbing the timing signals, and the name \"reference\", \"black and burst\", \"color black\", or \"black burst\" is usually given to such a signal. A composite colour video signal inherently carries the same reference signals and can be used as a generator-locking signal, albeit at the risk of being disturbed by out-of-specification picture signals.\n\nAlthough some high-definition broadcast systems may use a standard-definition reference signal as a generator-locking reference signal, the use of tri-level synchronising pulses directly related to the frame and line rate is increasing within HD systems. A tri-level sync pulse is a signal that initially goes from 0 volts DC to a negative voltage, then a positive voltage, before returning to zero volts DC again. The voltage excursions are typically 300 mV either side of zero volts, and the duration each of the two excursions is the same as a particular number of digital picture samples.\n\nMost television studio and professional video cameras have dedicated generator-locking ports on the camera. If the camera is tethered with a triaxial cable or optical fibre cable, the analog generator-locking signal is used to lock the camera control unit, which in turn locks the camera head by means of information carried within a data channel transmitted along the cable. If the camera is an ENG-type camera, one without a triax/fibre connection or without a dockable head, the generator-locking signal is carried through a separate cable from the video.\n\n\"Natlock\" is a picture-source synchronizing system using audio tone signals to describe the timing discrepancies between composite video signals, whilst \"Icelock\" uses digital information conveyed in the vertical blanking interval of a composite video signal.\n\n"}

This mark is placed between the last two letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. \"report\" in singular is \",\" hence the plural \"\"). Acronyms can be formed from strings of single initial letters, e.g. \"\" pazátsta (for ), or multiple initial letters, e.g. (for , the Holy Land) or ráshlats (for , Rishon LeZion).\n\nIf the acronym is read as is, then the spelling should be with a final form letter. If, on the other hand, the acronym is read as the complete phrase or read as the individual letters, then it should be spelled with a medial form letter. In practice, this rule is more often than not ignored, and the acronyms spelled either way.\n\nAbbreviations that are truncations of a single word, consisting of the first letter or first several letters of that word (as opposed to acronyms formed from initials or truncations of more than one word) are denoted using the punctuation mark geresh () by placing the sign after the last letter of the abbreviation (e.g. \"Ms.\": \"\"). However, in practice, single and double quotes are often used instead of the special punctuation marks (for which most keyboards do not have keys), with the single quote used both in acronyms and abbreviations.\n\nOften (and especially when they describe a noun), Hebrew acronyms are pronounced by the insertion of a vowel sound (usually ) between the letters. These vowels often appear in transliterations to other scripts. Examples include Shas (), Tanakh () and Shabak (). There are exceptions to the use of \"a\", such as Etzel ().\n\nWhen one of the letters is vav or yud, these may be read as vowels (\"u\"/“o” and \"i\") instead: (\"duakh\"/\"dokh\" = , judgement and account); (\"admor\" = , hasidic rebbe; (\"shut\" = , questions and answers); (\"sakum\" = , knife spoon and fork); (\"tapuz\" = , orange, lit. golden apple); (\"um\" = , the United Nations); Bilu; Lehi. (An exception is , Beitar, pronounced \"beytar\".)\n\nHebrew numbers (e.g. year numbers in the Hebrew calendar) are written the same way as acronyms, with gershayim before the last character, but pronounced as separate letter names. For example,  (5775 AM, or 2014-2015 CE) is pronounced hei-tav-shin-ayin-hei.\n\nAcronyms have been widely used in Hebrew since at least the Middle Ages. Several important rabbis are referred to with acronyms of their names. For example, Rabbi Shlomo ben Yitzchak is known as Rashi, Rav Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) is commonly known as \"Rambam\" (Hebrew: ), Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman (Nahmanides) is likewise known as the \"Ramban\" (Hebrew: ), and Baal Shem Tov is called the \"Besht\" (Hebrew: ).\n\nA number of such acronyms differ only in their last letter. They all begin with \"Mahara-\", as an acronym of the words ... (\"Morenu Ha-Rav rabi ...\", Our teacher the Rabbi ...).\" \n\nThe usage of Hebrew acronyms extends to liturgical groupings: the word \"Tanakh\" (Hebrew: תנ״ך) is an acronym for Torah (Five Books of Moses), Nevi'im (Book of Prophets), and Ketuvim (Hagiographa).\n\nMost often, though, one will find use of acronyms as acrostics, in both prayer, poetry (see Piyyut), and kabbalistic works. Because each Hebrew letter also has a numeric value, embedding an acrostic may give an additional layer of meaning to these works.\n\nOne purpose of acrostics was as a mnemonic or a way for an author to weave his name as a signature, or some other spiritual thought, into his work, at a time when much was memorized. Examples of prayers which contain acrostics include:\n\n\nישי נוימן, גורמים פגרמטיים, סמנטיים וגרפופונמיים במילוּן קיצורי הכתב, החוג הישראלי לבלשנו ת 18, 2011\n"}

There is some controversy about his actual place of birth possibly having been around Diyarbekir (modern Diyarbakır). He wrote a major Ottoman literary work in Persian, named \"Hasht Bihisht\", which begun in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight Ottoman rulers.\n\nBitlisi's father, Hosam al-Din Ali Bitlisi, was a Sufi author strongly affliated to the Sufi Nurbakhshi sect. Like his father, Idris Bitlisi began his career in the Akkoyunlu court, in the service of Yakup Bey, son of Uzun Hasan. Later, he attracted the attention of the Ottoman sultan Selim I and served under him for much of the rest of his life. He joined Selim I in his campaigns against the Mamluks and the Safavids. Bitlisi assisted the sultan in establishing an Ottoman administration in Egypt, now the Egypt Eyalet (province) of the Ottoman Empire, after its conquest in 1517. He was appointed to numerous administrative positions of significant responsibility including Kazasker (district supreme administrative judge) of Diyarbekir and Arabia.\n\nBitlisi was instrumental in the incorporation of the territories of Urfa and Mosul into the Ottoman Empire without a war, and of Mardin after a long siege. He played a key role in driving the Alevi Turkomans from the whole region and the assimilation and Ottomanization of the remaining Sunni Kurds.\n\nHe died in Constantinople on 15 November 1520, shortly after the death of his longtime benefactor, Sultan Selim I.

Schoeman wrote primarily in Afrikaans, although several of his non-fiction books were originally written in English. His novels are increasingly being translated into other languages, notably, English, French and Dutch.\n\nBorn in 1939 in Trompsburg, South Africa, Karel Schoeman matriculated in 1956 from Paarl Boys' High School. In 1959, he obtained a BA degree in languages from the University of the Free State. In 1961, he joined the Franciscan Order in Ireland as a novice for the priesthood, but then returned to Bloemfontein to obtain a Higher Diploma in Library Studies. During the 1970s, he went into voluntary exile, working first as a librarian in Amsterdam and then as a nurse in Glasgow, Scotland. He returned to South Africa in 1977 and worked until his retirement in 1998 as an archivist at the South African National Library in Cape Town.

George calls him \"a prominent lieutenant of Lokmanya Tilak\". He was editor of Kesari, Lokmanya and Navakal. Khadilkar in the beginning of his career wrote prose-plays, but achieved \"even greater recognition\" with plays like \"Svayamvara\" – which had songs which were based on Indian classical music. The notability of his dramatic technique, in his fifteen plays, was to \"endow ancient Hindu legends and tales with contemporary political significance\". The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti), remarks that while Annasaheb Kirloskar \"laid the foundation of popular sangit natak\", it saw its great rise and gradual decline with the advent of Khadilkar. It considers Khadilkar along with Bal Gandharva as \"the architect of what later on came to be called the golden age of the Marathi drama\".\n\nIn 1921, after Tilak's death, \"Lokmanya\" was founded by admirers of Tilak. Khadilkar assumed its editorship. In 1923 he resigned because of his support of Gandhi's position in division of nationalist political opinion, under opposition from the promoters who rejected it. In March 1923 Khadilkar started his own newspaper Nava Kaal, which \"supported Gandhi's programme\" and its editorials \"preached Gandhi's philosophy.\n\nKhadilkar was born on 25 November 1872 in Sangli. At age 15, he wrote a novel, and the next year he wrote a play. He received his B.A. degree in 1892 from Deccan College in Pune. Out of his abiding interest in plays, he closely studied during his college years the plays of Sanskrit and English playwrights.\n\nIn 1897, Khadilkar joined the editorial staff of Bal Gangadhar Tilak's daily \"Kesari\" (केसरी). His ideas and literary style so closely matched those of Tilak that the readers of \"Kesari\" never knew as to which of the two had written the editorials appearing in the newspaper. In 1908 the colonial government arrested Tilak on charges of sedition for an article written by Khadilkar. Tilak was sentenced to six years transportation to be served in Mandalay.\n\nDuring 1908–10, Khadilkar served as the chief editor of Tilak's English daily \"Maratha\" besides serving on the editorial board of \"Kesari\". In 1910, he left the editorship of both \"Kesari\" and \"Maratha\", but returned to work as the editor of \"Keasari\" during 1917–20.\n\nKhadilkar was a part of plot that envisioned the invasion of India by the only indedendent Hindu King of a part of India: The king of Nepal. This invasion was to spark an uprising within the country in his support, so that India would be one soverigh Hindu state under the King of Nepal. Tilak's trusted lieutenants Vasukaka Joshi and Khadilkar, entered Nepal, \"where they set up a tile factory, as a respectale front for an arms and munitions plant designed to supply to the invading Nepalese army.\" A Maharashtrian school teacher Mataji, introduced the two to the King of Nepal. They received a contract to retile the palace roof. They were joined by Hanmantrao Kulkarni of Jabalpur and Ketkar from Gwalior. The King of Nepal was influenced to send Nepalese students to Japan for technical training. Joshi went to Japan and the United States. The German arms manufacturing machinery never arrived. The plot never \"even approached fruition\".\n\nAfter Tilak's death in 1920, Khadilkar worked as the editor of daily \"Lokamanya\" (लोकमान्य) during 1921–23. In 1923, he founded daily Nava Kal (नवा काळ), which supported Gandhi. In 1929, British authorities imprisoned Khadilkar for a year for the crime of disloyalty to the colonial government.\n\nKhadilkar presided over Marathi Sahitya Sammelan at Nagpur in 1933.\n\nHe died on 26 August 1948.\n\n\"Kichak Vadh\" (The Assassination of Kichak) (1907) is a play based on an episode in the Mahabharat, Kichak is a minister at the court of Virat who attempts to molest Draupadi, he is assassinated by her husband Bhima as a result. The play was a manifestation of resistance to British rule. This molestation is used as a metaphor for the policies of the British colonial government in India. Kichak represented Lord Curzon: Viceroy to the King, just as Kichak was minister to King Virat; Draupadi represented India and Bhima represented an extremist nationalist, in contrast to Yudhishtar, standing for moderate nationalism. \"The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature...\" states that \"Kichaka was cast in the mould of the then Viceroy, Lord Curzon, and some of his aggressively arrogant utterences (like, 'the rulers are rulers and the slaves are slaves') found direct echoes in the words of Kichaka, while the popular mood of resentment and revolt was vehemently expressed by the fiery speeches of Draupadi and Bhima\" Bhatia considers that the playwright contrasts the aggression and hatred of the government for its colonial subjects with the resistance of those who attempt rescue the nation from colonial evils. Themes of sacrifice, war and duty \"sharpened the quest of freedom\". The play was an allegorical attack on the colonial government. Nagendra considers the play as a notable example of the use of a mythological character as a symbol of oppression.\n\nIgnatius Valentine Chirol's 1910 book \"Indian Unrest\" describes the play's plot and explains the allegories. According to Chirol, the play provides a response to John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn, who ridiculed the boast of radical nationalists that they could free their country and defend it from invaders. Chirol suggests that any Englishman who saw the play would remember vividly the tense scowling face of the men as they watch the outrages of Kichak and tearful eyes of the ladies as they watch \"Draupadi's entreaties\", \"their scorn for Yudhishthira's tameness, their admiration of Bhima's passionate protests, and the deep hum of satisfaction which approves the slaughter of the tyrant.\"\n\nThe Press Act in India was requested for sanction by the Government of India, in response to the sudden rise in revolutionary activities in 1909. Morley refused in deference to hostile reactions from the English public and \"'Friends of India' members of the Parliament.\" Kincaid was asked to write on the \"seditious climate fostered by the native papers\". Kincaid wrote four articles in the Times, amongst them was \"A seditious play of the Deccan', a critique of the Marathi play Kichak Vadh by K. P. Khadilkar\" as an example of sedition. These articles written on 18 January 1910, not only hastened the passage of the India Press Act of 1910 but also called for Kichak Vadh to be banned. The articles were reproduced by The Times of India and Bombay Gazette on 5 and 7 February 1910 respectively. The play was finally banned.\n\n\"The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: K to Navalram\" mentions that \"the London Times, in an eloquent outburst against this play, said in effect, Khadilkar is a most dangerous extremist, and Kichak Vadha is a cleverly veiled incitement to murder the European officials.\"\n\nThe following is the list of Khadilkar's plays:\n\nSarkar considers Khadilkar a versatile genius who created \"several types of womanhood in some of his dramas in verse.\" Vidyaharan (Stealing of learning) \"will be found to be more complex in treatment of the relations between the sexes than is Rabindranath Tagore's Chitra. ... Rukmini-swayamvara (The Choosing of her husband by Rukmini) and Draupadi, Marathas can see the female sex in its atmosphere of freedom, individualism.\" He notes that Kirloskar was \"a genuine poet in whose songs the people find the flow of the soul which as a rule is not characteristic of Khadilkar's compositions\" According to Anagol, Girijabai Kelkar wrote \"Purushanche Band\" to counteract the \"effects of vilification of Indian women in Khadilkar's \"Striyancha Band\"\"\n\nA revised version of Sangeet Maanapmaan played in Maharashtra in 2011–2012, the centenary year of the play's first performance. It has been revised by Rahul Deshpande. \"Originally, the play has five parts with around 52 classical songs. Deshpande's version will have two parts and 22 classical songs.\"\n"}

The book discusses Arabic-French bilingualism in Morocco.\n\nThe author was a Moroccan linguist who, after receiving his PhD, began teaching in the city of Fes (Fez) in Morocco. The book focused on \"balanced bilinguals\" who attended bilingual secondary schools and/or universities.\n\nIn the book Bentahila argued that the Moroccan officials do not consult their people on the language planning issue and therefore do not find success with their language planning. He also concludes that the bilingual Moroccans who establish the education system believe both Classical Arabic and French have an important role in Morocco's development and their own lives, and therefore they are highly loyal to both languages.\n\nAs part of his research, Bentahila collected data from 432 Moroccans, aged 17 to the late 30s who had been educated in both Arabic and French. His subjects included clerks, secretaries, students, and teachers.\n\nThe book has seven chapters. The initial portion of the book discusses the history of the languages of instruction in the Moroccan school system from the pre-colonial through post-colonial periods. The next portion involves the author discussing the results of his questionnaire. and includes a survey of the literature about the language situation from inside and outside the Maghreb. The book has a chapter about comparative attitudes towards Moroccan Arabic, Classical Arabic, and French. There is also a chapter on language planning in Morocco.\n\nPaul B. Stevens of the \"Journal of Language and Social Psychology\" said that it was the first book-length work on bilingualism in North Africa written in the English language, and for writing the book Bentahila \"is to be applauded on several counts.\" He said \"Taken as a whole, Bentahila's book is a worthwhile one and, some of the remarks which follow notwithstanding, it deserved to be read.\"\n\nBrian Weinstein of the \"Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development\" wrote that the book is \"an important addition to the literature on language attitudes\" and that it \"also is valuable methodologically and for the implicit and explicit suggestions for further research into attitudes and their relationship to social change or social stagnation.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "625125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=625125", "title": "Letter case", "text": "Letter case\n\nLetter case (or just case) is the distinction between the letters that are in larger upper case (also \"uppercase\", \"capital letters\", \"capitals\", \"caps\", \"large letters\", or more formally \"majuscule\") and smaller lower case (also \"lowercase\", \"small letters\", or more formally \"minuscule\") in the written representation of certain languages. The writing systems that distinguish between the upper and lower case have two parallel sets of letters, with each letter in one set usually having an equivalent in the other set. The two case variants are alternative representations of the same letter: they have the same name and pronunciation and are treated identically when sorting in alphabetical order.\n\nLetter case is generally applied in a mixed-case fashion, with both upper- and lower-case letters appearing in a given piece of text. The choice of case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline. In orthography, the upper case is primarily reserved for special purposes, such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun, which makes the lower case the more common variant in regular text. In some contexts, it is conventional to use one case only. For example, engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper-case letters, which are easier to distinguish than the lower case, especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small. In mathematics, on the other hand, letter case may indicate the relationship between objects, with upper-case letters often representing \"superior\" objects (e.g. \"X\" could be a set containing the generic member \"x\").\n\nThe terms \"upper case\" and \"lower case\" can be written as two consecutive words, connected with a hyphen (\"upper-case\" and \"lower-case\" – particularly if they pre-modify another noun), or as a single word (\"uppercase\" and \"lowercase\"). These terms originated from the common layouts of the shallow drawers called \"type cases\" used to hold the movable type for letterpress printing. Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate shallow tray or \"case\" that was located above the case that held the small letters.\n\n\"Majuscule\" ( or ), for palaeographers, is technically any script in which the letters have very few or very short ascenders and descenders, or none at all (for example, the majuscule scripts used in the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209, or the Book of Kells). By virtue of their visual impact, this made the term majuscule an apt descriptor for what much later came to be more commonly referred to as uppercase letters.\n\n\"Minuscule\" refers to lower-case letters. The word is often spelled \"miniscule\", by association with the unrelated word \"miniature\" and the prefix \"mini-\". This has traditionally been regarded as a spelling mistake (since \"minuscule\" is derived from the word \"minus\"), but is now so common that some dictionaries tend to accept it as a nonstandard or variant spelling. \"Miniscule\" is still less likely, however, to be used in reference to lower-case letters.\n\nThe glyphs of lower-case letters can resemble smaller forms of the upper-case glyphs restricted to the base band (e.g. \"C/c\" and \"S/s\", cf. small caps) or can look hardly related (e.g. \"D/d\" and \"G/g\"). Here is a comparison of the upper and lower case variants of each letter included in the English alphabet (the exact representation will vary according to the typeface and font used):\n\nTypographically, the basic difference between the majuscules and minuscules is not that the majuscules are big and minuscules small, but that the majuscules generally have the same height (although, depending on the typeface, there may be some exceptions, particularly with \"Q\" and sometimes \"J\" having a descending element; also, various diacritics can add to the normal height of a letter). \nThere is more variation in the height of the minuscules, as some of them have parts higher (ascenders) or lower (descenders) than the typical size. Normally, \"b, d, f, h, k, l, t \" are the letters with ascenders, and \"g, j, p, q, y\" are the ones with descenders. In addition, with old-style numerals still used by some traditional or classical fonts, \"6\" and \"8\" make up the ascender set, and \"3, 4, 5, 7\" and \"9\" the descender set.\n\nWriting systems using two separate cases are \"bicameral scripts\". Languages that use the Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Coptic, Armenian, Adlam, Warang Citi, Cherokee, and Osage scripts use letter cases in their written form as an aid to clarity. Other bicameral scripts, which are not used for any modern languages, are Old Hungarian, Glagolitic, and Deseret. The Georgian alphabet has several variants, and there were attempts to use them as different cases, but the modern written Georgian language does not distinguish case.\n\nMany other writing systems make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules – a system called unicameral script or unicase. This includes most syllabic and other non-alphabetic scripts.\n\nIn scripts with a case distinction, lower case is generally used for the majority of text; capitals are used for capitalisation and emphasis. Acronyms (and particularly initialisms) are often written in all-caps, depending on various factors.\n\nCapitalisation is the writing of a word with its first letter in uppercase and the remaining letters in lowercase. Capitalisation rules vary by language and are often quite complex, but in most modern languages that have capitalisation, the first word of every sentence is capitalised, as are all proper nouns. \n\nCapitalisation in English, in terms of the general orthographic rules independent of context (e.g. title vs. heading vs. text), is universally standardised for formal writing. Capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence, a proper noun, or a proper adjective. The names of the days of the week and the names of the months are also capitalised, as are the first-person pronoun \"I\" and the interjection \"O\" (although the latter is uncommon in modern usage, with \"oh\" being preferred). There are a few pairs of words of different meanings whose only difference is capitalisation of the first letter. Honorifics and personal titles showing rank or prestige are capitalised when used together with the name of the person (for example, \"Mr. Smith\", \"Bishop O'Brien\", \"Professor Moore\") or as a direct address, but normally not when used alone and in a more general sense. It can also be seen as customary to capitalise any word – in some contexts even a pronoun – referring to the deity of a monotheistic religion.\n\nOther words normally start with a lower-case letter. There are, however, situations where further capitalisation may be used to give added emphasis, for example in headings and publication titles (see below). In some traditional forms of poetry, capitalisation has conventionally been used as a marker to indicate the beginning of a line of verse independent of any grammatical feature.\n\nOther languages vary in their use of capitals. For example, in German all nouns are capitalised (this was previously common in English as well, mainly in the 17th and 18th centuries), while in Romance and most other European languages the names of the days of the week, the names of the months, and adjectives of nationality, religion and so on normally begin with a lower-case letter. On the other hand, in some languages it is customary to capitalise formal polite pronouns, for example \"De\", \"Dem\" (Danish), \"Sie\", \"Ihnen\" (German), and \"Vd\" or \"Ud\" (short for \"usted\" in Spanish).\n\nInformal communication, such as texting, instant messaging or a handwritten sticky note, may not bother to follow the conventions concerning capitalisation, but that is because its users usually do not expect it to be formal.\n\n\nSimilar orthographic and graphostylistic conventions are used for emphasis or following language-specific rules, including:\n\nIn English, a variety of case styles are used in various circumstances:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn English-language publications, various conventions are used for the capitalisation of words in publication titles and headlines, including chapter and section headings. The rules differ substantially between individual house styles.\n\nThe convention followed by many British publishers (including scientific publishers, like Nature, magazines, like \"The Economist\" and \"New Scientist\", and newspapers, like \"The Guardian\" and \"The Times\") and also U.S. newspapers, is sentence-style capitalisation in headlines, i.e. capitalisation follows the same rules that apply for sentences. This convention is usually called \"sentence case\". It may also be applied to publication titles, especially in bibliographic references and library catalogues. An example of a global publisher whose English-language house style prescribes sentence-case titles and headings is the International Organization for Standardization.\n\nFor publication titles it is, however, a common typographic practice among both British and U.S. publishers to capitalise significant words (and in the United States, this is often applied to headings, too). This family of typographic conventions is usually called \"title case\". For example, R. M. Ritter's \"Oxford Manual of Style\" (2002) suggests capitalising \"the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs, but generally not articles, conjunctions and short prepositions\". This is an old form of emphasis, similar to the more modern practice of using a larger or boldface font for titles. The rules which prescribe which words to capitalise are not based on any grammatically inherent correct/incorrect distinction and are not universally standardised; they differ between style guides, although most style guides tend to follow a few strong conventions, as follows:\n\nTitle case is widely used in many English-language publications, especially in the United States. However, its conventions are sometimes not followed strictly – especially in informal writing.\n\nIn creative typography, such as music record covers and other artistic material, all styles are commonly encountered, including all-lowercase letters and special case styles, such as studly caps (see below). For example, in the wordmarks of video games it is not uncommon to use stylised upper-case letters at the beginning and end of a title, with the intermediate letters in small caps or lower case (e.g., , , and ).\n\nSingle-word proper nouns are capitalised in formal written English, unless the name is intentionally stylised to break this rule (such as the first or last name of danah boyd).\n\nMulti-word proper nouns include names of organisations, publications, and people. Often the rules for \"title case\" (described in the previous section) are applied to these names, so that non-initial articles, conjunctions, and short prepositions are lowercase, and all other words are uppercase. For example, the short preposition \"of\" and the article \"the\" are lowercase in \"Steering Committee of the Finance Department\". Usually only capitalised words are used to form an acronym variant of the name, though there is some variation in this.\n\nWith personal names, this practice can vary (sometimes all words are capitalised, regardless of length or function), but is not limited to English names. Examples include the English names Tamar of Georgia and Catherine the Great, \"van\" and \"der\" in Dutch names, \"von\" and \"zu\" in German, \"de\", \"los\", and \"y\" in Spanish names, \"de\" or \"d'\" in French names, and \"ibn\" in Arabic names.\n\nSome surname prefixes also affect the capitalisation of the following internal letter or word, for example \"Mac\" in Celtic names and \"Al\" in Arabic names.\n\nSome case styles are not used in standard English, but are common in computer programming, product branding, or other specialised fields:\n\n\nIn the International System of Units (SI), a letter usually has different meanings in upper and lower case when used as a unit symbol. Generally, unit symbols are written in lower case, but if the name of the unit is derived from a proper noun, the first letter of the symbol is capitalised (nevertheless, the \"name\" of the unit, if spelled out, is always considered a common noun and written accordingly):\n\n\nFor the purpose of clarity, the symbol for litre can optionally be written in upper case even though the name is not derived from a proper noun:\n\n\nThe letter case of a prefix symbol is determined independently of the unit symbol to which it is attached. Lower case is used for all submultiple prefix symbols and the small multiple prefix symbols up to \"k\" (for kilo, meaning 10 = 1000 multiplier), whereas upper case is used for larger multipliers:\n\n\nIn the character sets developed for computing, each upper- and lower-case letter is encoded as a separate character. In order to enable case folding and case conversion, the software needs to link together the two characters representing the case variants of a letter. (Some old character-encoding systems, such as the Baudot code, are restricted to one set of letters, usually represented by the upper-case variants.)\n\nCase-insensitive operations can be said to fold case, from the idea of folding the character code table so that upper- and lower-case letters coincide. The conversion of letter case in a string is common practice in computer applications, for instance to make case-insensitive comparisons. Many high-level programming languages provide simple methods for case conversion, at least for the ASCII character set.\n\nWhether or not the case variants are treated as equivalent to each other varies depending on the computer system and context. For example, user passwords are generally case sensitive in order to allow more diversity and make them more difficult to break. On the other hand, when performing a keyword search, differentiating between the upper and lower case might narrow down the search result too much.\n\nUnicode defines case folding through the three case-mapping properties of each character: upper case, lower case, and title case (in this context, \"title case\" relates to ligatures and digraphs encoded as mixed-case single characters, in which the first component is in upper case and the second component in lower case). These properties relate all characters in scripts with differing cases to the other case variants of the character.\n\nAs briefly discussed in Unicode Technical Note #26, \"In terms of implementation issues, any attempt at a unification of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic would wreak havoc [and] make casing operations an unholy mess, in effect making all casing operations context sensitive […]\". In other words, while the shapes of letters like A, B, E, H, K, M, O, P, T, X, Y and so on are shared between the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets (and small differences in their canonical forms may be considered to be of a merely typographical nature), it would still be problematic for a multilingual character set or a font to provide only a \"single\" code point for, say, uppercase letter B, as this would make it quite difficult for a wordprocessor to change that single uppercase letter to one of the three different choices for the lower-case letter, the Latin b (U+0062), Greek β (U+03B2) or Cyrillic в (U+0432). Therefore, the corresponding Latin, Greek and Cyrillic upper-case letters (U+0042, U+0392 and U+0412, respectively) are also encoded as separate characters, despite their appearance being basically identical. Without letter case, a \"unified European alphabet\"such as ABБCГDΔΕЄЗFΦGHIИJ…Z, with an appropriate subset for each languageis feasible; but considering letter case, it becomes very clear that these alphabets are rather distinct sets of symbols.\n\nMost modern word processors provide automated case conversion with a simple click or keystroke. For example, in Microsoft Office Word, there is a dialog box for toggling the selected text through UPPERCASE, then lowercase, then Title Case (actually start caps; exception words must be lowercased individually). The keystroke does the same thing.\n\nIn some forms of BASIC there are two methods for case conversion:\nC and C++, as well as any C-like language that conforms to its standard library, provide these functions in the file ctype.h:\nCase conversion is different with different character sets. In ASCII or EBCDIC, case can be converted in the following way, in C:\n\nThis only works because the letters of upper and lower cases are spaced out equally. In ASCII they are consecutive, whereas with EBCDIC they are not; nonetheless the upper-case letters are arranged in the same pattern and with the same gaps as are the lower-case letters, so the technique still works.\n\nSome computer programming languages offer facilities for converting text to a form in which all words are capitalised. Visual Basic calls this \"proper case\"; Python calls it \"title case\". This differs from usual title casing conventions, such as the English convention in which minor words are not capitalised.\n\nOriginally alphabets were written entirely in majuscule letters, spaced between well-defined upper and lower bounds. When written quickly with a pen, these tended to turn into rounder and much simpler forms. It is from these that the first minuscule hands developed, the half-uncials and cursive minuscule, which no longer stayed bound between a pair of lines. These in turn formed the foundations for the Carolingian minuscule script, developed by Alcuin for use in the court of Charlemagne, which quickly spread across Europe. The advantage of the minuscule over majuscule was improved, faster readability.\n\nIn Latin, papyri from Herculaneum dating before 79 CE (when it was destroyed) have been found that have been written in old Roman cursive, where the early forms of minuscule letters \"d\", \"h\" and \"r\", for example, can already be recognised. According to papyrologist Knut Kleve, \"The theory, then, that the lower-case letters have been developed from the fifth century uncials and the ninth century Carolingian minuscules seems to be wrong.\" Both majuscule and minuscule letters existed, but the difference between the two variants was initially stylistic rather than orthographic and the writing system was still basically unicameral: a given handwritten document could use either one style or the other but these were not mixed. European languages, except for Ancient Greek and Latin, did not make the case distinction before about 1300.\n\nThe timeline of writing in Western Europe can be divided into four eras:\n\nTraditionally, certain letters were rendered differently according to a set of rules. In particular, those letters that began sentences or nouns were made larger and often written in a distinct script. There was no fixed capitalisation system until the early 18th century. The English language eventually dropped the rule for nouns, while the German language keeps it.\n\nSimilar developments have taken place in other alphabets. The lower-case script for the Greek alphabet has its origins in the 7th century and acquired its quadrilinear form in the 8th century. Over time, uncial letter forms were increasingly mixed into the script. The earliest dated Greek lower-case text is the Uspenski Gospels (MS 461) in the year 835. The modern practice of capitalising the first letter of every sentence seems to be imported (and is rarely used when printing Ancient Greek materials even today).\n\nThe individual type blocks used in hand typesetting are stored in shallow wooden or metal drawers known as \"type cases\". Each is subdivided into a number of compartments (\"boxes\") for the storage of different individual letters.\n\nThe \"Oxford Universal Dictionary on Historical Advanced Proportional Principles\" (reprinted 1952) indicates that \"case\" in this sense (referring to the box or frame used by a compositor in the printing trade) was first used in English in 1588. Originally one large case was used for each typeface, then \"divided cases\", pairs of cases for majuscules and minuscules, were introduced in the region of today's Belgium by 1563, England by 1588, and France before 1723.\n\nThe terms \"upper\" and \"lower\" case originate from this division. By convention, when the two cases were taken out of the storage rack, and placed on a rack on the compositor's desk, the case containing the capitals and small capitals stood at a steeper angle at the back of the desk, with the case for the small letters, punctuation and spaces being more easily reached at a shallower angle below it to the front of the desk, hence upper and lower case.\n\nThough pairs of cases were used in English-speaking countries and many European countries in the seventeenth century, in Germany and Scandinavia the single case continued in use.\n\nVarious patterns of cases are available, often with the compartments for lower-case letters varying in size according to the frequency of use of letters, so that the commonest letters are grouped together in larger boxes at the centre of the case. The compositor takes the letter blocks from the compartments and places them in a composing stick, working from left to right and placing the letters upside down with the nick to the top, then sets the assembled type in a galley.\n\n"}

{"id": "4122426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4122426", "title": "Modularity (biology)", "text": "Modularity (biology)\n\nModularity refers to the ability of a system to organize discrete, individual units that can overall increase the efficiency of network activity and, in a biological sense, facilitates selective forces upon the network. Modularity is observed in all model systems, and can be studied at nearly every scale of biological organization, from molecular interactions all the way up to the whole organism.\n\nThe exact evolutionary origins of biological modularity has been debated since the 1990s. In the mid 1990s, Günter Wagner argued that modularity could have arisen and been maintained through the interaction of four evolutionary modes of action:\n\n[1] Selection for the rate of adaptation: If different complexes evolve at different rates, then those evolving more quickly reach fixation in a population faster than other complexes. Thus, common evolutionary rates could be forcing the genes for certain proteins to evolve together while preventing other genes from being co-opted unless there is a shift in evolutionary rate.\n\n[2] Constructional selection: When a gene exists in many duplicated copies, it may be maintained because of the many connections it has (also termed pleiotropy). There is evidence that this is so following whole genome duplication, or duplication at a single locus. However, the direct relationship that duplication processes have with modularity has yet to be directly examined.\n\n[3] Stabilizing selection: While seeming antithetical to forming novel modules, Wagner maintains that it is important to consider the effects of stabilizing selection as it may be \"an important counter force against the evolution of modularity\". Stabilizing selection, if ubiquitously spread across the network, could then be a \"wall\" that makes the formation of novel interactions more difficult and maintains previously established interactions. Against such strong positive selection, other evolutionary forces acting on the network must exist, with gaps of relaxed selection, to allow focused reorganization to occur.\n\n[4] Compounded effect of stabilizing and directional selection: This is the explanation seemingly favored by Wagner and his contemporaries as it provides a model through which modularity is constricted, but still able to unidirectionally explore different evolutionary outcomes. The semi-antagonistic relationship is best illustrated using the corridor model, whereby stabilizing selection forms barriers in \"phenotype space\" that only allow the system to move towards the \"optimum\" along a single path. This allows directional selection to act and inch the system closer to optimum through this evolutionary corridor.\n\nFor over a decade, researchers examined the dynamics of selection on network modularity. However, in 2013 Clune and colleagues challenged the sole focus on selective forces, and instead provided evidence that there are inherent \"connectivity costs\" that limit the number of connections between nodes to maximize efficiency of transmission. This hypothesis originated from neurological studies that found that there is an inverse relationship between the number of neural connections and the overall efficiency (more connections seemed to limit the overall performance speed/precision of the network). This connectivity cost had yet to be applied to evolutionary analyses. Clune et al. created a series of models that compared the efficiency of various \"evolved\" network topologies in an environment where performance, their only metric for selection, was taken into account, and another treatment where performance as well as the connectivity cost were factored together. The results show not only that modularity formed ubiquitously in the models that factored in connection cost, but that these models also outperformed the performance-only based counterparts in every task. This suggests a potential model for module evolution whereby modules form from a system’s tendency to resist maximizing connections to create more efficient and compartmentalized network topologies.\n\n\n"}

These files will be all found together in one folder. The spell checking is done using the .aff file for the locale together with the .dic file. The .dic file is a list of words along with a group of letters which refer to the affixes found in the .aff file. This saves space because instead of having to include all forms of a word, like jump (jumping, jumps, jumped), the .dic file will include the word once and the references to the affixes in the .aff file allow the construction of all the other forms.\n\nIt is not enough to copy the files for a locale into the folder. As there are multiple locales, automatic loading of all dictionaries would cause a considerable overhead.

An old inclusion of Haida is now considered doubtful.\n\nIn February 2008, a proposal connecting Na-Dene (excluding Haida) to the Yeniseian languages of central Siberia into a Dené–Yeniseian family was published and well-received by a number of linguists. It was proposed in a 2014 paper that the Na-Dene languages of North America and the Yeniseian languages of Siberia had a common origin in a language spoken in Beringia, between the two continents.\n\nEdward Sapir originally constructed the term \"Na-Dene\" to refer to a combined family of Athabaskan, Tlingit, and Haida (the existence of the Eyak language was not known to him at the time). In his \"The Na-Dene languages: A preliminary report\", he describes how he arrived at the term (Sapir 1915, p. 558):\nIn its non-controversial core, Na-Dene consists of two branches, Tlingit and Athabaskan–Eyak:\n\nFor linguists who follow Edward Sapir in connecting Haida to the above languages, Haida represents an additional branch, with Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit together forming the other. Dene or Dine (the Athabaskan languages) is a widely distributed group of Native languages spoken by associated peoples in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Alaska, parts of Oregon, northern California, and the American Southwest as far as northern Mexico.\n\nThe southwestern division of Athabaskan is also called Southern Athabaskan or Apachean, and includes Navajo and all the Apache dialects. Eyak was spoken in south-central Alaska; the last speaker died in 2008. Navajo is by far the most widely spoken language of the Na-Dene family, spoken in Arizona, New Mexico, and other regions of the American Southwest.\n\nAll of these languages share a highly complex prefixing verb structure in which tense and mood markers are interdigitated between subject and object agreement markers. The morphological hallmark of the family is a series of prefixes found directly before the verb root that raise or lower the transitivity of the verb word. These prefixes, traditionally known as \"classifiers\", derive historically from a combination of three distinct classes of morphemes and are not found in any other Native American language family.\n\nThe phoneme system contains a large number of dorsal (velar or uvular) consonants (fronting in many modern Athabaskan languages to palatals and velars, correspondingly) as well as a general absence of labial obstruents (except where /b/ has arisen from *w). In the historical phonology there is a widespread tendency, observable across many Athabaskan languages, for phonemic tonal distinctions to arise from glottal features originally found at the end of the syllable. The glottal features in question are often evident in Eyak or Tlingit. These languages are typologically unusual in containing extensive prefixation yet being SOV and postpositional, features normally associated with suffixing languages.\n\nA genealogical connection between the Tlingit, Eyak and Athabaskan languages was suggested early in the 19th century, but not universally accepted until much later. Haida, with 15 fluent speakers (M. Krauss, 1995), was originally linked to Tlingit by Franz Boas in 1894. Both Haida and Tlingit were then connected to Athabaskan by Edward Sapir in 1915. Linguists such as Lyle Campbell (1997) today consider the evidence inconclusive. They have classified Haida as a language isolate. In order to emphasise the exclusion of Haida, Campbell refers to the language family as \"Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit\" rather than \"Na-Dene\". In 2010 Jeff Leer published extensive primary materials on what he calls \"PAET\" (Proto-Athabascan–Eyak–Tlingit).\n\nIn 2008, Edward Vajda of Western Washington University presented evidence suggesting that the Na-Dene languages (Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit) might be related to the Yeniseian (or Yeniseic) languages of Siberia, the only living representative of which is the Ket language.\n\nKey evidence by current comparative methodologies includes homologies in verb prefixes and also a systematic correspondence between the distribution of Ket tones and consonant articulations found in Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit. Vajda's paper has been favorably reviewed by several experts on Na-Dene and Yeniseic languages, including Michael Krauss, Jeff Leer, James Kari, and Heinrich Werner, as well as a number of other well-known linguists, including Bernard Comrie, Johanna Nichols, Victor Golla, Michael Fortescue, and Eric Hamp. The conclusion of this seminar was that the comparison with Yeniseic data shows that Haida cannot be classified in a genealogical unit with Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit.\n\nAccording to Joseph Greenberg's controversial classification of the languages of Native North America, Na-Dené (including Haida) is one of the three main groups of Native languages spoken in the Americas. Contemporary supporters of Greenberg's theory, such as Merritt Ruhlen, have suggested that the Na-Dené language family represents a distinct migration of people from Asia into the New World that occurred six to eight thousand years ago, placing it around four thousand years later than the previous migration into the Americas by Amerind speakers; this remains an unproven hypothesis.. Ruhlen speculates that the Na-Dené speakers may have arrived in boats, initially settling near the Haida Gwaii, now in British Columbia, Canada. \n\nLinguist Edward Sapir suggested that the Sino-Tibetan languages are related to Na-Dené. More recent hypotheses, e.g. by Sergei Starostin, suggest that Na-Dené (including Haida) may belong to the much broader Dené–Caucasian superfamily, which also contains the North Caucasian languages, Sino-Tibetan languages, and Yeniseian languages.\n\nNotes:\n\n"}
{"id": "2083364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083364", "title": "Nathan Salmon", "text": "Nathan Salmon\n\nNathan U. Salmon (; né Nathan Salmon Ucuzoglu in 1951) is an American philosopher in the analytic tradition, specializing in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of logic.\n\nSalmon was born January 2, 1951 in Los Angeles to a working-class family of Sephardi Jews of Spanish-Turkish heritage. He is the grandson of archivist Emily Sene (née Emily Perez) and oud player Isaac Sene. Salmon attended Lincoln Elementary School in Torrance, California through eighth grade, where he was a classmate and friend of the child prodigy, James Newton Howard. Salmon graduated from North High School (Torrance) in 1969.\nThe first person in his family to go to college, Salmon graduated from El Camino College (1971) and from the University of California, Los Angeles (B.A. 1973, M.A. 1974, Ph.D. 1979). At UCLA he studied with Tyler Burge, Alonzo Church, Keith Donnellan, Donald Kalish, David Kaplan, Saul Kripke, and Yiannis Moschovakis. Salmon was assistant professor of philosophy at Princeton University from 1978 to 1982. In 1984, the Council of Graduate Schools awarded him the Gustave O. Arlt Award in the Humanities, for his book, \"Reference and Essence\" (1981), which was based on his UCLA doctoral dissertation. His second book, \"Frege's Puzzle\" (1986), was selected by Scott Soames for a literary website as one of the best five books on the philosophy of language.\n\nSalmon is currently Distinguished Professor of philosophy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and has been teaching there since 1984. He has also taught at UCLA, the University of California, Riverside, the University of Southern California, and was a regular visiting distinguished professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center from 2009 to 2012.\n\nSalmon is a proponent of the theory of direct reference. Salmon has provided accounts both of propositional attitudes and of Frege's puzzle about true identifications, i.e., truths of the form \"\"a\" = \"b\"\". Salmon maintains that co-designative proper names are inter-substitutable with preservation of semantic content. Thus, on his view the sentence \"Samuel Clemens was witty\" expresses exactly the same content as \"Mark Twain was witty\", whether or not the competent user of these sentences recognizes it. Therefore, a person who believes that Mark Twain was witty \"ipso facto\" believes that Samuel Clemens was witty, even if he or she also believes, inconsistently, that Clemens was not witty. Salmon argues that this is made palatable by recognizing that to believe a proposition is to be cognitively disposed in a particular manner toward that proposition when taking it by means of some \"proposition-guise\" or other, and that one may be so disposed relative to one proposition-guise while not being so disposed relative to another. Salmon applies this apparatus to solve a variety of famous philosophical puzzles, including Frege's puzzle, Kripke's puzzle about so-called \"de dicto\" belief, and W. V. O. Quine's puzzle about \"de re\" belief. For example, Quine describes a scenario in which Ralph believes that Ortcutt is no spy, yet Ralph also believes that the man in the brown hat is a spy, when unbeknownst to Ralph the man in the hat is none other than Ortcutt. Under these circumstances, is Ortcutt believed by Ralph to be a spy? The grounds for an affirmative or negative judgment seem equally balanced. On Salmon's account Ortcutt is believed by Ralph to be a spy, since Ralph is appropriately cognitively disposed toward the proposition about Ortcutt that he is a spy when taking that proposition by means of one proposition-guise, even though Ralph is not so disposed relative to an alternative, equally relevant proposition-guise.\n\nSalmon provided direct-reference accounts of problems of nonexistence and of names from fiction. Salmon argues, directly contrary to Immanuel Kant, that existence is a property, one that particular individuals have and other individuals lack. According to Salmon, the English verb \"exist\" is (along with its literal translations into other languages), among other things, a term for this alleged property, and a sentence of the form \"\"a\" exists\" is true if and only if the subject term designates something with the property, and is false (and \"\"a\" does not exist\" is true) if and only if the subject term designates something with the complementary property of nonexistence. Thus Russell's example, \"The present king of France exists\", is neither true nor false, since France is not presently a monarchy, and therefore \"the present king of France\" does not designate; whereas \"Napoleon exists\" is simply false, since although Napoleon once existed, the moment he died he took on the property of nonexistence.\n\nBy contrast, Salmon maintains that \"Sherlock Holmes exists\" is literally true, whereas \"Sherlock Holmes was a detective\" is literally false. According to Salmon, Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character, a kind of abstract entity, created by author Arthur Conan Doyle, and the fiction is a story, or a collection of stories, which are about that very character but are literally false. Holmes really exists, but is only depicted as a detective in the fiction. In the fiction, Holmes is a detective; in reality, Holmes is merely a fictional detective.\n\nSalmon extends this view to what he calls \"mythical objects\", like the hypothetical planet, Vulcan. Vulcan really exists, but it is not a real planet. It is an abstract entity that is only depicted as a planet in the myth. Salmon's account of fiction and myth thus has direct application to the philosophy of religion. Salmon has also applied his account of mythical objects to Peter Geach's famous problem of uncovering the logical form of the particular sentence, \"Hob thinks a witch has blighted Bob's mare, and Nob wonders whether she (the same witch) killed Cob's sow\". Salmon's account shows how the problematic sentence can be true even though there are no witches, and even if Hob and Nob do not know about each other, and there is no one whom they think is a witch.\n\nSalmon thinks, again contrary to Kant, that it is perfectly legitimate to invoke existence in a term's definition. Thus \"God\" might be legitimately defined as \"the conceivable individual that is divine and also exists\". According to Salmon, the ontological argument for God's existence fallaciously assumes that \"The \"F\" is \"F\"\" is a truth of logic, or an analytic truth. What is true by logic is a significantly weaker variant: \"If anything is uniquely \"F\", then the \"F\" is \"F\". The strongest conclusion that validly follows from the proposed definition is that \"if\" any conceivable individual actually is uniquely both divine and existent, \"then\" God actually exists. This same conclusion is also a trivial logical consequence of the atheist's contention that no conceivable individual actually is uniquely both divine and existent. According to Salmon's critique, the ontological argument thus shows nothing.\n\nSalmon argues that natural-language sentences that are representable as λ-converts of one another (in the sense of Church's lambda-calculus) are, although logically equivalent by λ-conversion, typically not strictly synonymous, i.e., they typically differ in semantic content—as for example \"a\" is large and also \"a\" is seaworthy\" and \"\"a\" is a thing that is both large and seaworthy\".\n\nSalmon maintains a sharp division between semantics and pragmatics (speech acts). He argues that in uttering a sentence, a speaker typically asserts a good deal more than the words' semantic content, and that, consequently, it is a mistake to identify the semantic content of a sentence with what is said by its speaker. Salmon maintains that such an identification is an instance of a mistaken form of argument in the philosophy of language, \"the pragmatic fallacy.\"\n\nSalmon is also known in metaphysics for, among other things, his analysis of arguments for essentialism—the doctrine that some properties of things are properties that those things could not fail to have (except perhaps by not existing). In particular, Salmon is known for his development and defense of a \"reductio ad absurdum\" argument, using a sorites-like problem (slippery slope), against nearly universally accepted modal logic systems S4 and S5, which he argues commit \"the fallacy of necessity iteration,\" sanctioning the invalid inference from the observation that a proposition \"p\" is a necessary truth to the conclusion that it is a necessary truth that \"p\" is a necessary truth. He defends his view by exposing a mistake in a standard argument favoring S5, while arguing that there are not only possible worlds—thought of as maximal scenarios that might have obtained—but in addition classically consistent \"impossible worlds\": maximal scenarios that could not obtain.\n\nSalmon also provided a controversial \"reductio ad absurdum\" \"disproof\" of indeterminate identity, i.e., the philosophically popular idea that for some pairs of things there is no fact of the matter concerning whether those things are one and the very same. Salmon argues that if there were such a pair of things, \"x\" and \"y\", then this pair would have to be different from the reflexive pair of \"x\" with itself, since there is a fact concerning whether \"x\" and \"x\" are the same. It would then follow by set theory that \"x\" and \"y\" are not the same, and in that case there would be a fact of the matter after all concerning whether \"x\" and \"y\" are the same: they are not. Therefore, there cannot be a pair of things for which there is no fact concerning their identity. On the other hand, Salmon maintains that not all vagueness is due to language and some indeterminacy results from how things themselves are, i.e., that for some things and some attributes, independently of language, there is no fact of the matter concerning whether those things have those attributes. Critics of Salmon's alleged proof acknowledge that the highlighted difference between <\"x\", \"y\"> and <\"x\", \"x\">—that there is a fact whether the elements of the latter, but not of the former, are the same thing—is genuine, but respond that it does not validly support the conclusion that those pairs are not the same.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "573724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=573724", "title": "Niuean language", "text": "Niuean language\n\nNiuean (; ) is a Polynesian language, belonging to the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup of the Austronesian languages. It is most closely related to Tongan and slightly more distantly to other Polynesian languages such as Māori, Sāmoan, and Hawaiʻian. Together, Tongan and Niuean form the Tongic subgroup of the Polynesian languages. Niuean also has a number of influences from Samoan and Eastern Polynesian languages.\n\nNiuean was spoken by 1600 people on Niue Island (97.4% of the inhabitants) in 1991, as well as by speakers in the Cook Islands, New Zealand, and Tonga, for a total of around 8,000 speakers. There are thus more speakers of Niuean outside the island itself than on the island. Most inhabitants of Niue are bilingual in English.\n\nIn the early 1990s 70% of the speakers of Niuean lived in New Zealand.\n\nNiuean consists of two main dialects, the older Motu dialect from the north of the island and the Tafiti dialect of the south. The words mean, respectively, \"the people of the island\" and \"the strangers\" (or \"people from a distance\").\n\nThe differences between the dialects are mainly in vocabulary or in the form of some words.\n\nExamples of differences in vocabulary are volu (Tafiti) vs matā (Motu) for \"scrape, scraper\" and lala (Tafiti) vs kautoga (Motu) for \"guava (plant)\"; examples of differences in form include hafule (T) / afule (M), aloka/haloka, nai/nei, ikiiki/likiliki, and malona/maona.\n\n is an allophone of before front vowels (both long and short and ; this most likely arose from the affrication of to before these vowels and subsequent change of to . While older foreign borrowings (such as \"tī\" from English \"tea\") underwent this change along with (or perhaps by analogy with) native words, words borrowed into Niuean after this development retain the original (for example, \"telefoni\" and \"tikulī\" from \"telephone\" and \"degree\").\n\nVowel length is distinctive in Niuean; vowels are either long or short. Furthermore, two adjacent identical vowels (whether short-short, short-long, long-short, or long-long) form a \"rearticulated vowel\"; the sound is distinct from one long vowel.\n\nBoth short and long vowels can occur in any position.\n\nAll short vowels may combine with one another to form diphthongs. The possible diphthongs are:\n\nRearticulation is the separate pronunciation of two adjacent vowels, as opposed to diphthongs which are written as two letters but pronounced as one sound. These two vowels may be the same or be different ones.\n\nRearticulation typically occurs across morpheme boundaries, for example, when a suffix ending with a vowel comes before a root beginning with that same vowel. It may also occur, rarely, within monomorphemic words (words that consist of only one morpheme) as a result of the elision of a historical intervocalic consonant.\n\nTwo adjacent identical short vowels are always rearticulated, as are combinations of any two long vowels or a short and a long vowel; two adjacent different short vowels may be rearticulated or form a diphthong, and this has to be determined from the morphology or history of the word.\n\nThe basic structure of a Niuean syllable is (C)V(V); all syllables end in a vowel or diphthong, and may start with at most one consonant. Consonant clusters in borrowed words are broken up with epenthetic vowels, e.g. English \"tractor\" becomes .\n\nThe stress on a Niuean word is nearly always on the penult (second-to-last syllable), though multi-syllable words ending in a long vowel put primary stress on the final long vowel and secondary stress on the penult. Long vowels in other positions also attract a secondary stress.\n\nThe Niuean language does not contain the glottal stop which is present in its closest relative, Tongan; this has caused some distinct words to merge. For example, Tongan \"year\" and \"fight\" have merged in Niuean as .\n\nNiuean orthography is largely phonemic; that is, one letter stands for one sound and \"vice versa\".\n\nThe traditional alphabet order, given with the traditional names of the letters, is ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, fā, gā, hā, kā, lā, mō, nū, pī, tī, vī, rō, sā. Note that rō and sā as introduced letters are ordered at the end.\n\nSperlich (1997) uses an alphabetical order based on English for his dictionary: a, ā, e, ē, f, g, h, i, ī, k, l, m, n, o, ō, p, s, t, u, ū, v (r is left out since no words start with this letter). He recommends that consonants be named consistently with a following ā: fā, gā, hā, kā, lā, mā, nā, pā, tā, vā, rā, sā.\n\nVowel length can be marked with a macron; however, this is not always done.\n\nAs with many languages, writing was brought to Niue in connection with religion, in this case with Christianity by missionaries educated in Samoa. This has led to some Samoan influences in morphology and grammar and also to a noticeable one in spelling: as in Samoan, the sound () is written g, rather than ng as in Tongan and some other Polynesian languages with this sound. (McEwen (1970) uses ng in his dictionary; however, this feature of his spelling was not popular, particularly since it conflicted with the spelling used in the Niuean Bible.)\n\nNiuean can be considered a VSO language; however, one analysis of Niuean uses ergative terminology, in which case it may be better to speak of verb–agent–patient word order.\n\nBecause the unmarked case is the absolutive, Niuean transitive verb constructions often appear passive in a literal translation.\n\nCompare\n\nand\n\nThe first example sentence could also be translated into English as the nominative–accusative construction \"He saw the crab\".\n\nNiuean pronouns are differentiated by person and number. Furthermore, first person non-singular (dual and plural) pronouns distinguish inclusive and exclusive forms, including and excluding the listener, respectively. However, they are not differentiated by gender or case; for example, ia means both \"he\" and \"she\", \"him\" and \"her\" (inanimates ['it'] are not usually pronominalised).\n\nThe Niuean pronouns are:\n\nNote that the endings of the dual and plural forms resemble the numbers 2 and 3, ua and tolu.\n\nSome numbers in Niuean are:\n\nTens and ones combine with ma, e.g. hogofulu ma taha, 11; tolugofulu ma ono, 36.\n\nThe numbers from one to nine (and occasionally higher numbers) can take the prefix toko- when used to count persons; for example, tokolima \"five (for people)\".\n\nNumbers are used as verbs, for example:\n\nor\n\nor\n\nMorphology comprises the ways in which words are built up from smaller, meaningful sub-units, or how words change their form in certain circumstances.\n\nSuppletion concerns closely related words (often singular and plural forms of nouns or verbs) which are based on very different forms, for example fano \"to go\" (used with a singular subject) and ō \"to go\" (used with a plural subject). This can be compared to English \"go\" and \"went\", which are forms of the same verb yet differ in form.\n\nReduplication is frequently used in Niuean morphology to derive different nouns. Reduplication is the process of taking the entire morpheme, or sometimes only the first or last syllable or two, and repeating it.\n\nThis is used for several purposes, including:\n\n\nAn example of a whole-morpheme reduplication indicating a plural verb is molemole \"to have passed by, to be gone\" from mole \"to have passed by, to be gone\"; an example of a whole-morpheme reduplication indicating a frequentative verb is molomolo \"to keep squeezing\" from molo \"to squeeze, to compress\".\n\nExamples of part-morpheme reduplication are gagau \"to bite\" from gau \"to chew\" (first part of the syllable reduplicated), gegele \"to make a crying sound\" from gele \"to start to cry (of babies\") (first syllable reduplicated), and molūlū \"to be very soft, to be very weak\" from molū \"to be soft, to be weak\" (last syllable reduplicated).\n\nReduplication is also frequently employed together with affixes.\n\nAffixes (prefixes and suffixes) are frequently used for a variety of purposes; there is also one circumfix, fe- -aki (sometimes fe- -naki or fe- -taki), which is used to form reciprocal verbs (\"to ... one another\").\n\nA common suffix is -aga, which is a nominaliser: it forms nouns from verbs.\n\nA common prefix with faka-, with a variety of meanings, the most common being a causative one (e.g. ako \"to learn\", fakaako \"to teach\").\n\nWords may also have more than one prefix or suffix, as fakamalipilipi \"to break\" (used with a plural object), from faka-, ma-, and a reduplicated lipi \"to break\".\n\nMany words are simply formed by joining together other words, for example vakalele \"aeroplane\" from vaka \"canoe\" and lele \"fly\" (i.e. literally, \"flying canoe\"). Diane Massam has extensively studied a special type of compounding which she has termed pseudo noun incorporation, a type of noun incorporation.\n\n\n"}

The other two citations in PsychInfo include his dissertation, which concerned the infant's understanding of the visual cliff, and a paper he co-authored in 1993, \"The influence of reminder trials on contextual interference effects.\"\n\nIn 1997, Titzer began selling \"Your Baby Can Read!\" videos. By 2003, around 60,000 had been sold. In September 2007, Dr. Titzer and his company sold the rights to his programs to a new company that exclusively advertised and sold the products in North America. In April 2011, a complaint was filed with the FTC against this new company. The complaint, by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said the new company's advertising claims were false and deceptive. In July 2012, the new company folded, citing the high cost of fighting legal battles. At that time, the rights to the programs reverted to Dr. Titzer and his company. Titzer also trains preschool teachers in many countries and he consults with learning centers and preschools in India, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, the United States, and China.\n\nThough there have been millions of fans of Dr. Titzer and his products, some people have criticized Titzer's videos as being suspect because they lack rigorous scientific review and are commercial products.\n\nIn November 2010, Jeff Rossen and Robert Powell of NBC's \"Today\" wrote that Titzer \"calls himself an infant learning expert but actually holds a graduate degree in 'human performance' — the study of motor skills.\"\n\nMaryanne Wolf, Tufts University's director of cognitive neuroscience, said: \"It's an extraordinary manipulation of facts.\" \"Today\" interviewed ten experts who affirmed that the brains of babies and toddlers had not attained the requisite development to read at \"the level the way the enticing television ads claim they can\". Titzer argued against these claims, saying that scientific research supported the effectiveness of Your Baby Can Read. There have been more than a dozen mostly very positive studies on the program which is likely more than any other baby learning product.\n\nOn August 22, 2014, a press release from the Federal Trade Commission related the following:\n\"Your Baby Can Read creator, Dr. Robert Titzer, and his company, Infant Learning, Inc. d/b/a The Infant Learning Company have settled charges that they made baseless claims about the effectiveness of the Your Baby Can Read program and misrepresented that scientific studies proved the claims.\". Dr. Titzer now has broken his ties with the marketing company which used infomercials to sell the products in huge numbers. He now often works with people in the field of early childhood education to market the products.\n\nTitzer and his family live just outside San Diego, California.\n"}
{"id": "1112494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1112494", "title": "Roman Urdu", "text": "Roman Urdu\n\nRoman Urdu is the name used for the Urdu language written with the Roman script.\n\nAccording to the Urdu scholar Habib R. Sulemani: \"Roman Urdu is strongly opposed by the traditional Arabic script lovers. Despite this opposition it is still used by most on the internet and computers due to limitations of most technologies as they do not have the Urdu script. Although, this script is under development and thus the net users are using the Roman script in their own ways. Popular websites like Jang Group have devised their own schemes for Roman Urdu. This is of great advantage for those who are not able to read the Arabic script. MSN, Yahoo and some desi-chat-rooms are working as laboratories for the evolving new script and language (Roman Urdu).\"\n\nRoman Urdu is often used by multinational corporation like Unilever or Pepsi to save money and resources on printing and advertising while marketing their products in both India and Pakistan.\n\nAlthough the idea of romanizing Urdu had been suggested several times, it was General Ayub Khan who most seriously suggested adopting the Roman script for Urdu and all Pakistani languages during his rule of the country. The suggestion was inspired to an extent by Atatürk's adoption of Roman for Turkish in Turkey.\n\nIn India, where the Devanagari script is used, Roman Urdu was widely used in the Indian Army, as well as in Christian mission schools, especially for translations of the Bible.\n\nKhudáwand merá chaupán hai; mujhe kamí na hogí. <br>\nWuh mujhe harí harí charágáhoṉ meṉ bithátá hai: Wuh mijhe ráhat ke chashmoṉ ke pás le játá hai.<br> Wuh merí ján ko bahál kartá hai: Wuh mujhe apne nám kí khátir sadáqat kí ráhon par le chaltá hai. <br>\nBalki khwáh maut ke sáye kí wádí meṉ se merá guzar ho, Maiṉ kisí balá se nahíṉ darúṉgá; kyúnkṉki tú mere sáth hai: Tere 'asá aur terí láthí se mujhe tasallí hai. <br>\nTú mere dushmanoṉ ke rúbarú mere áge dastarkhwán bichhátá hai: Tú ne mere sir par tel malá hai, merá piyála labrez hotá hai. <br>\nYaqínan bhalái aur rahmat 'umr bhar mere sáth sáth raheṉgí: Aur maiṉ hamesha Khudáwand ke ghar meṉ sukúnat karúṉgá.\n\n <br>\n\nUrdu was the dominant native language among Christians of Karachi, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan in the 20th century and is still used today by some people in these Pakistani and Indian states. Pakistani and Indian Christians often used the Roman script for writing Urdu. Thus Roman Urdu was a common way of writing among the Christians in these states up to the 1960s. The Bible Society of India publishes Roman Urdu Bibles, which enjoyed sale late into the 1960s (though they are still published today). Church songbooks are also common in Roman Urdu. However, the usage of Roman Urdu in Christian contexts is declining in India with the wider use of Hindi and English in the states.\n\nBollywood, India's major film industry, uses a version of Roman script as the main script for its film titles. This is because Bollywood films have an appeal for viewers across South Asia and even in the Middle East. The Devanāgarī script is used mostly by Hindi speakers while the Perso-Arabic script is used primarily by Urdu speakers. The language used in Bollywood films is often called Hindi, but most dialogues are actually written in Hindustani—they can be understood by Urdu and Hindi speakers alike. Because the film industry wants to reach the largest possible audience, just using the Devanāgarī or Perso-Arabic script would be unfavorable for the Bollywood industry as few individuals are literate in both scripts. For this reason, the neutral Roman script is used for Bollywood film titles, though some films include the Hindi and Urdu scripts as well.\n\nThe similar circumstances are also applied with Pakistan's Lollywood filming industry, where, along with the Urdu name or title of the movie, a Roman Urdu title is always provided for viewers.\n\nRoman Urdu used on Internet is non standard and has very irregular spellings. Users who use Roman Urdu on Internet try to imitate English orthography. In most cases they are unaware of the fact that English spellings are not often phonetic.\n\nThere are several Romanization standards for writing Urdu among them the most prominent are Uddin and Begum Urdu-Hindustani Romanization, ALA-LC romanization and ArabTeX.\n\nThere are two main problems with Roman Urdu schemes which exists. Either they are not reversible to Urdu script or they don't allow pronouncing the Urdu words properly. Another shortcoming is that a lot of Roman Urdu schemes confuse the Urdu letter 'Choti He' which has the sound of voiceless glottal fricative with 'Do Chasham He' which is used as a digraph for aspirated consonants in Urdu script. The digraphs \"Sh\" for letter Shin and \"Zh\" for letter Zhe also cause problems as they could be interpreted as the letter Sin and 'Choti He' or letter Ze and 'Choti He' respectively. Most Roman Urdu schemes also do not take much consideration of Urdu orthography and the spelling system.\n\nInitiated in 2011, the Hamari Boli Initiative is a full-scale open-source Language planning initiative aimed at Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu) Script, Style, Status & Lexical reform and modernization. One of primary stated objectives of Hamari Boli is to relieve Hindustani of the crippling Devanagari-Nastaliq Digraphia by way of Romanization\n\nIn Pakistan Roman Urdu is promoted by the Liberal, Secular and Westernized sections of the society as an alternate to the Perso-Arabic Script which Urdu uses. In contrast, the adoption of Roman Urdu has stiff opposition from the Conservative classes which see Perso-Arabic Script as the heritage of Indo-Islamic Civilization which Pakistan inherited from the Mughal and other past Islamic empires.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8423377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8423377", "title": "Sensory leakage", "text": "Sensory leakage\n\nSensory leakage is a term used to refer to information that transferred to a person by conventional means (other than Psi) during an experiment into Psi.\n\nFor example, where the subject in an ESP experiment receives a visual cue — the reflection of a Zener card in the holder's glasses — sensory leakage can be said to have occurred.\n\nScientists such as Donovan Rawcliffe (1952), C. E. M. Hansel (1980), Ray Hyman (1989) and Andrew Neher (2011) have studied the history of psi experiments from the late 19th century up until the 1980s. In every experiment investigated, flaws and weaknesses were discovered so the possibility of naturalistic explanations (such as sensory cues) or deception and trickery were not ruled out. The data from the Creery sister and the Soal-Goldney experiments were proven to be fraudulent, one of the subjects from the Smith-Blackburn experiments confessed to fraud, the Brugmans experiment, the experiments by John E. Coover and those conducted by Joseph Gaither Pratt and Helmut Schmidt did not rule out the possibility of sensory cues or trickery.\n\nIn the 20th century J. B. Rhine carried out experiments into ESP. His experiments were discredited due to the discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues. Terence Hines has written:\n\nThe methods the Rhines used to prevent subjects from gaining hints and clues as to the design on the cards were far from adequate. In many experiments, the cards were displayed face up, but hidden behind a small wooden shield. Several ways of obtaining information about the design on the card remain even in the presence of the shield. For instance, the subject may be able sometimes to see the design on the face-up card reflected in the agent’s glasses. Even if the agent isn’t wearing glasses it is possible to see the reflection in his cornea.\n\nOnce Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects. Due to the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies. Rhine's experiments into psychokinesis (PK) were also criticized. John Sladek wrote:\n\nHis research used dice, with subjects 'willing' them to fall a certain way. Not only can dice be drilled, shaved, falsely numbered and manipulated, but even straight dice often show bias in the long run. Casinos for this reason retire dice often, but at Duke, subjects continued to try for the same effect on the same dice over long experimental runs. Not surprisingly, PK appeared at Duke and nowhere else.\n\nThe Turner-Owenby long distance telepathy experiment was discovered to contain flaws. Frances May Turner positioned herself in the Duke Parapsychology Laboratory whilst Sarah Owenby claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment Turner would think of a symbol and write it down whilst Owenby would write her guesses. The scores were highly successful and both records were supposed to be sent to J. B. Rhine, however, Owenby sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average.\n\nA famous ESP experiment at the Duke University was performed by Lucien Warner and Mildred Raible. The subject was locked in a room with a switch controlling a signal light elsewhere, which he could signal to guess the card. Ten runs with ESP packs of cards were used and he achieved 93 hits (43 more than chance). Weaknesses with the experiment were later discovered. The duration of the light signal could be varied so that the subject could call for specific symbols and certain symbols in the experiment came up far more often than others which indicated either poor shuffling or card manipulation.\n\nThe ganzfeld experiment studies that were examined by Ray Hyman and Charles Honorton had methodological problems that were well documented. Honorton reported only 36% of the studies used duplicate target sets of pictures to avoid handling cues. Hyman discovered flaws in all of the 42 ganzfeld experiments and to assess each experiment, he devised a set of 12 categories of flaws. Six of these concerned statistical defects, the other six covered procedural flaws such as inadequate documentation, randomization and security as well as possibilities of sensory leakage. Over half of the studies failed to safeguard against sensory leakage and all of the studies contained at least one of the 12 flaws. Because of the flaws, Honorton agreed with Hyman the 42 ganzfeld studies could not support the claim for the existence of psi.\n\nPossibilities of sensory leakage in the ganzfeld experiments included the receivers hearing what was going on in the sender's room next door as the rooms were not soundproof and the sender's fingerprints to be visible on the target object for the receiver to see.\n\nHyman also reviewed the autoganzfeld experiments and discovered a pattern in the data that implied a visual cue may have taken place:\n\nHyman wrote the autoganzfeld experiments were flawed because they did not preclude the possibility of sensory leakage.\n\nThe psychologists David Marks and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff’s remote viewing experiments. In a series of thirty-five studies, they were unable to replicate the results so investigated the procedure of the original experiments. Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff's experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday's two targets, or they had the date of the session written at the top of the page. They concluded that these clues were the reason for the experiment's high hit rates. According to Terence Hines:\n\nThomas Gilovich has written:\n\nAccording to Marks, when the cues were eliminated the results fell to a chance level. Marks was able to achieve 100 per cent accuracy without visiting any of the sites himself but by using cues. James Randi has written controlled tests by several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cuing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests, produced negative results. Students were also able to solve Puthoff and Targ's locations from the clues that had inadvertently been included in the transcripts.\n\nMarks and Kamman concluded: \"Until remote viewing can be confirmed in conditions which prevent sensory cueing the conclusions of Targ and Puthoff remain an unsubstantiated hypothesis.\"\n\nIn 1980, Charles Tart claimed that a rejudging of the transcripts from one of Targ and Puthoff’s experiments revealed an above-chance result. Targ and Puthoff again refused to provide copies of the transcripts and it was not until July 1985 that they were made available for study when it was discovered they still contained sensory cues. Marks and Christopher Scott (1986) wrote \"considering the importance for the remote viewing hypothesis of adequate cue removal, Tart’s failure to perform this basic task seems beyond comprehension. As previously concluded, remote viewing has not been demonstrated in the experiments conducted by Puthoff and Targ, only the repeated failure of the investigators to remove sensory cues.\"\n"}
