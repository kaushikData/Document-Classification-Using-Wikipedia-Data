This data is stored in the ASiC in a ZIP format. \n\nEuropean Commission Implementing Decision 2015/1506 of 8 September 2015 laid down specifications relating to formats of advanced electronic signatures and advanced seals to be recognised by public sector bodies pursuant to Articles 27 and 37 of the eIDAS-regulation. EU Member States requiring an advanced electronic signature or an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate, shall recognise XML, CMS or PDF advanced electronic signature at conformance level B, T or LT level or using an associated signature container, where those signatures comply with the following technical specifications:\n\n\nTechnical specification of ASiCs have been updated and standardized since April 2016 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute in the standard \"Associated Signature Containers (ASiC)\"(ETSI EN 319 162-1 V1.1.1 (2016-04), but this updated standard is not required by the European Commission Implementing Decision.\n\nThe internal structure of an ASiC includes two folders:\n\nSuch an electronic signature file would contain a single CAdES object or one or more XAdES signatures. A time assertion file would either contain a one timestamp token that will conform to IETF RFC 3161, whereas a single evidence record would conform to IETF RFC 4998 or IETF RFC6283.\n\nOne of the purposes of an electronic signature is to secure the data that it is attached to it from being modified. This can be done by creating a dataset that combines the signature with its signed data or to store the detached signature to a separate resource and then utilize an external process to re-associate the signature with its data. It can be advantageous to use detached signatures because it prevents unauthorized modifications to the original data objects. However, by doing this, there is the risk that the detached signature will become separated from its associated data. If this were to happen, the association would be lost and therefore, the data would become inaccessible.\n\nUsing the correct tool for each job is always important. Using the correct type of ASiC container for the job at hand is also important:\n\nWith this container, a single file object is associated with a signature or time assertion file. A “mimetype” file that specifies the media type might also be included in this container. When a mimetype file is included, it is required to be the first file in the ASiC container. This container type will allow additional signatures to be added in the future to be used to sign stored file objects. When long-term time-stamp tokens are used, ASiC Archive Manifest files are used to protect long-term time-stamp tokens from tampering.\n\nThis type of container can hold one or more signature or time assertion files. ASiC-E with XAdES deals with signature files, while ASiC-E with CAdES deals with time assertions. The files within these ASiC containers apply to their own file object sets. Each file object might have additional metadata or information that is associated with it that can also be protected by the signature. An ASiC-E container could be designed to prevent this modification or allow its inclusion without causing damage to previous signatures.\n\nBoth of these ASiC containers are capable of maintaining long-term availability and integrity when storing XAdES or CAdES signatures through the use of time-stamp tokens or evidence record manifest files that are contained within the containers. ASiC containers must comply with the ZIP specification and limitations that are applied to ZIP.\n\nThis container operates under the baseline requirements of the ASiC Simple (ASiC-S) container but it also provides additional time assertion requirements. Additional elements may be within its META-INF folder and requires the use of “SignedData” variable to include certificate and revocation information.\n\nThis container has the same baselines as an ASiC-E container, but with additional restrictions.\n\nThis container complies with ASiC-E baseline requirements along with additional requirements and restrictions.\n\nThe use of ASiC reduces the risk of an electronic signature becoming separated from its data by combining the signature and its signed data in a container. With both elements secured within an ASiC, it is easier to distribute a signature and guarantee that the correct signature and its metadata is being used during validation. This process can also be used when associating time assertions, including evidence records or time-stamp tokens to their associated data.\n\n"}

Its earliest transcripts date from the 1960s, and it now has contents (transcripts, audio, and video) in 26 languages from 130 different corpora, all of which are publicly available worldwide. Recently, CHILDES has been made into a component of the larger corpus TalkBank, which also includes language data from aphasics, second language acquisition, conversation analysis, and classroom language learning. CHILDES is mainly used for analyzing the language of young children and the child directed speech of adults.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, as computational resources capable of easily manipulating the data volumes found in CHILDES became commonly available, there was a significant increase in the number of studies of child language acquisition that made use of it. CHILDES is currently directed and maintained by Brian MacWhinney at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nThere are a variety of languages and ages represented in the CHILDES transcripts. The majority of the transcripts are from spontaneous interactions and conversations. The transcriptions are coded in the CHAT (Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts) transcription format, which provides a standardized format for producing conversational transcripts. This system can be used to transcribe conversations with any type of language learner: children, second-language learners, and recovering aphasics. In addition to discourse level transcription, the CHAT system also has options for phonological and morphological analysis. The CLAN program was developed by Leonid Spektor and aids in transcription and analysis of the child language data.\n\nTo date, over 4500 published studies cite CHILDES. CHILDES reports this number in their manuals and Google Scholar contains 5451 citations as of July 2017.\n\n"}
{"id": "24760387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24760387", "title": "Cantonese phonology", "text": "Cantonese phonology\n\nThe standard pronunciation of Cantonese is that of Guangzhou, also known as Canton, the capital of Guangdong Province. Hong Kong Cantonese is related to the Guangzhou dialect, and the two diverge only slightly. Yue dialects in other parts of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, such as Taishanese, may be considered divergent to a greater degree.\n\nA syllable generally corresponds to a word or character. Most syllables are etymologically associated with either standard Chinese characters or colloquial Cantonese characters. Modern linguists have discovered there are about 1,760 syllables being used in the entire Cantonese vocabulary, which cover the pronunciations of more than 10,000 Chinese characters. Therefore, the average number of homophonous characters per syllable is six.\nPhonetically speaking, a Cantonese syllable has only two parts – the sound and the tone.\n\nA Cantonese syllable usually consists of an initial (onset) and a final (rime). There are about 630 syllables in the Cantonese syllabary.\nSome of these, such as and (), (), () are no longer common; some, such as and (), or and (), have traditionally had two equally correct pronunciations but are beginning to be pronounced with only one particular way by its speakers (and this usually happens because the \"unused\" pronunciation is almost unique to that word alone), thus making the \"unused\" sounds effectively disappear from the language; some, such as (), (), (), (), have alternative nonstandard pronunciations which have become mainstream (as , , and respectively), again making some of the sounds disappear from the everyday use of the language; and yet others, such as (), (), () have become popularly (but erroneously) believed to be made-up/borrowed words to represent sounds in modern vernacular Cantonese when they have in fact been retaining those sounds before these vernacular usages became popular.\n\nOn the other hand, there are new words circulating in Hong Kong which use combinations of sounds which had not appeared in Cantonese before, such as \"get\" (note: this is nonstandard usage as was never an accepted/valid final for sounds in Cantonese, though the final sound has appeared in vernacular Cantonese before this, – notably in describing the measure word of gooey or sticky substances such as mud, glue, chewing gum, etc.); the sound is borrowed from the English word \"get\" meaning \"to understand\".\n\nInitials (or onsets) refer to the 19 initial consonants which may occur at the beginning of a sound. Some sounds have no initials and they are said to have null initial. The following is the inventory for Cantonese as represented in IPA:\nNote the aspiration contrast and the lack of voicing contrast for stops. The affricates are grouped with the stops for compactness in the chart.\n\n\nThe position of the coronals varies from dental to alveolar, with and more likely to be dental. The position of the coronal affricates and sibilants , , is alveolar and articulatory findings indicate they are not significantly palatalized by vowels. Historically, there was another series of alveolo-palatal sibilants as discussed below.\n\nFinals (or rimes) are the part of the sound after the initial. A final is typically composed of a main vowel (nucleus) and a terminal (coda).\n\nA main vowel can be long or short, depending on vowel length. The vowels , and are each long-short pairs with corresponding formants on acoustic findings, while the vowels are also phonologically analysed as a long-short pair. The vowels of Cantonese are as shown:\n\nA terminal can be a semivowel, a nasal consonant, or a stop consonant. The semivowel is rounded after rounded vowels. Nasal consonants can occur as base syllables in their own right and these are known as syllabic nasals. The stop consonants () are unreleased ().\n\nThe following chart lists all the finals in Cantonese as represented in IPA.\n\nA narrow transcription of the vowels that are conventionally transcribed is actually , as both are central and not fully open. The same can be said of the diphthongs , as their actual phonetic realizations are . See the vowel charts at the right.\n\nWhen the three checked tones are separated, the stop codas become allophones of the nasal codas respectively, because they are in the complementary distribution in which the former three appear in the checked tones and the latter three appear in the non-checked tones.\n\nLike other Chinese dialects, Cantonese uses tone contours to distinguish words, with the number of possible tones depending on the type of final. While Guangzhou Cantonese generally distinguishes between high-falling and high level tones, the two have merged in Hong Kong Cantonese and Macau Cantonese, yielding a system of six different tones in syllables ending in a semi-vowel or nasal consonant. (Some of these have more than one realization, but such differences are not used to distinguish words.) In finals that end in a stop consonant, the number of tones is reduced to three; in Chinese descriptions, these \"checked tones\" are treated separately by diachronic convention, so that Cantonese is traditionally said to have nine tones. However, phonetically these are a conflation of tone and final consonant; the number of phonemic tones is six in Hong Kong and seven in Guangzhou.\n\nFor purposes of meters in Chinese poetry, the first and fourth tones are the \"flat/level tones\" (), while the rest are the \"oblique tones\" (). This follows their regular evolution from the four tones of Middle Chinese.\n\nThe first tone can be either high level or high falling usually without affecting the meaning of the words being spoken. Most speakers are in general not consciously aware of when they use and when to use high level and high falling. In Hong Kong, most speakers have merged the high level and high falling tones. In Guangzhou, the high falling tone is disappearing as well, but is still prevalent among certain words, e.g. in traditional Yale Romanization with diacritics, \"sàam\" (high falling) means the number three , whereas \"sāam\" (high level) means shirt .\n\nThe relative pitch of the tones varies with the speaker; consequently, descriptions vary from one sources to another. The difference between high and mid level tone (1 and 3) is about twice that between mid and low level (3 and 6): 60 Hz to 30 Hz. Low falling (4) starts at the same pitch as low level (6), but then drops; as is common with falling tones, it is shorter than the three level tones. The two rising tones, (2) and (5), both start at the level of (6), but rise to the level of (1) and (3), respectively.\n\nThe tone 3, 4, 5 and 6 are dipping in the last syllable when is an interrogative sentence or an exclamatory sentence. \"really?\" is pronounced .\n\nThe numbers \"394052786\" when pronounced in Cantonese, will give the nine tones in order (Romanisation (Yale) saam1, gau2, sei3, ling4, ng5, yi6, chat7, baat8, luk9), thus giving a good mnemonic for remembering the nine tones.\n\nLike other Yue dialects, Cantonese preserves an analog to the voicing distinction of Middle Chinese in the manner shown in the chart below.\n\nThe distinction of voiced and voiceless consonants found in Middle Chinese was preserved by the distinction of tones in Cantonese. The difference in vowel length further caused the splitting of the dark entering tone, making Cantonese (as well as other Yue Chinese branches) one of the few Chinese varieties to have further split a tone after the voicing-related splitting of the Middle Chinese four tones.\n\nCantonese is special in the way that the vowel length can affect both the rime and the tone. Some linguists believe that the vowel length feature may have roots in the Old Chinese language.\n\nThere are also two changed tones, which add the diminutive-like meaning \"that familiar example\" to a standard word. For example, the word for \"silver\" (, \"ngan4\") in a modified tone (\"ngan2\") means \"coin\". They are comparable to the diminutive suffixes and of Mandarin. In addition, modified tones are used in compounds, reduplications ( \"kam4 kam4 cheng1\" > \"kam4 kam2 cheng1 \"in a hurry\"\") and direct address to family members ( \"mui6 mui6\" > \"mui4 mui2\" \"sister\"). The two modified tones are high level, like tone 1, and mid rising, like tone 2, though for some people not as high as tone 2. The high level changed tone is more common for speakers with a high falling tone; for others, mid rising (or its variant realization) is the main changed tone, in which case it only operates on those syllables with a non-high level and non-mid rising tone (i.e. only tones 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Yale and Jyutping romanizations may have changed tones). However, in certain specific vocatives, the changed tone does indeed result in a high level tone (tone 1), including speakers without a phonemically distinct high falling tone.\n\nLike other languages, Cantonese is constantly undergoing sound change, processes where more and more native speakers of a language change the pronunciations of certain sounds.\n\nOne shift that affected Cantonese in the past was the loss of distinction between the alveolar and the alveolo-palatal (sometimes termed as postalveolar) sibilants, which occurred during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This distinction was documented in many Cantonese dictionaries and pronunciation guides published prior to the 1950s but is no longer distinguished in any modern Cantonese dictionary.\n\nPublications that documented this distinction include:\n\nThe depalatalization of sibilants caused many words that were once distinct to sound the same. For comparison, this distinction is still made in modern Standard Mandarin, with most alveolo-palatal sibilants in Cantonese corresponding to the retroflex sibilants in Mandarin. For instance:\nEven though the aforementioned references observed the distinction, most of them also noted that the depalatalization phenomenon was already occurring at the time. Williams (1856) writes:\n\nCowles (1914) adds:\n\nA vestige of this palatalization difference is sometimes reflected in the romanization scheme used to romanize Cantonese names in Hong Kong. For instance, many names will be spelled with \"sh\" even though the \"\"sh\" sound\" () is no longer used to pronounce the word. Examples include the surname (), which is often romanized as \"Shek\", and the names of places like Sha Tin (; ).\n\nThe alveolo-palatal sibilants occur in complementary distribution with the retroflex sibilants in Mandarin, with the alveolo-palatal sibilants only occurring before , or . However, Mandarin also retains the medials, where and can occur, as can be seen in the examples above. Cantonese had lost its medials sometime ago in its history, reducing the ability for speakers to distinguish its sibilant initials.\n\nIn modern-day Hong Kong, many younger speakers are unable to distinguish between certain phoneme pairs such as vs. and merge one sound into another. Although that is often considered as substandard and is denounced as being \"lazy sounds\" (), it is becoming more common and is influencing other Cantonese-speaking regions (see Hong Kong Cantonese.) 肚餓 is sometimes read as [tʰoŋ13 ɔː22] not [tʰou̯13 ɔː22], 雪櫃 is sometimes read as [sɛːk33 kʷɐi̯22] not [syːt33 kʷɐi̯22] but sound change of these characters arelimit in that word.\n\n\n"}

He is the author of forty-two books and some 300 articles written between 1924 and 1987. Some of his works are available in the Indian Digital Library.\n\nHe actively engaged with the Indian Independence Movement led by Gandhi. Siva Rao’s analyses and critiques of British colonial rule drew the attention of the rulers—some of his books and pamphlets were proscribed, and he was accused and tried for sedition in the 1930s. As a volunteer for the Indian National Congress, he was in charge of publicity for Krishna District. He offered his legal services to many Congress volunteers who were arrested during the Salt Satyagraha. After Independence, he served on various government committees for the Telugu language.\n\nSiva Rao was active in the literary, cultural and intellectual scene of Andhra Pradesh and formed friendships with many of his contemporaries like Veluri Sivarama Sastry, Basavaraju Apparao, Viswanadha Satyanarayana, N. Gopi, and Narla Venkateswara Rao.\n\nSiva Rao was honoured by the Andhra Pradesh Government in 1966. The Andhra Pradesh History Congress honoured him twice.\n\nDigavalli Venkata Siva Rao was born on 14 February 1898 to Venkataratnam and Suryamanikyamba in Kakinada, a town in what was then the British-occupation authority administered Madras Presidency. His grandfather, Digavalli Timmarazu (1794-1856), was the English Record Keeper from 1828 at the District Collector’s Office in Kakinada. He was also the Court of Wards Manager for Pithapuram estate and rose to the position of \"Huzur Serishtadar\" in 1850, which was the highest office a native officer was permitted by the East India Company to occupy. His administrative decisions were recorded in the Godavary District Manual. Siva Rao’s grandfather also constructed the Sri Bhimeswaraswami Temple at Kakinada in 1828.\n\nSiva Rao lost his father at a very early age and lived with his sister, Seetha Bai, and brother-in-law, Boddapati Purnayya. He studied at Calicut and Bangalore before joining, from 1910 to 1916 in Rajahmundry, the Hithakarini School which was founded by Kandukuri Veeresalingam (on whom Siva Rao was to later write a book). Thereafter, he studied intermediate (F. A.) and B. A. in Madras Presidency College from 1916-1920 and obtained a B. L. degree (1920-1922) from Madras Law College. Some of the students studying in various other faculties who were his hostel-mates during his time in Madras stayed in touch with him and would also become famous: M. Bhaktavatsalam, Avinashilingam Chettiar, Adavi Baapiraju, Koka Subba Rao, Yellapragada Subbarow, Velidandla Hanumantha Rao, and Kanuri Lakshmana Rao, to mention a few.\n\nRajahmundry was a vibrant literary hub. Siva Rao’s literary talents were recognized early in the literary meetings he attended (along with Adavi Baapiraju) which were presided over by such luminaries as Kandukuri Veeresalingam, Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham, Chilukuri Veerabhadrarao, and others.\n\nDuring his Presidency College days in Madras, he won a Silver Medal in 1918 for his essay \"Loyalty\". He also received the Bourdillon Prize (including a cash reward of twenty rupees) of Presidency College for 1919-20. In 1922, he received the Powell and Morehead Prize (including a cash reward of 120 rupees) instituted by the College for his essay \"Pothana-Vemanala Yugamu\". He ran a handwritten-magazine called \"Andhra Vani\" during his Presidency College days.\n\n1922-1930: After he receiving his law degree in March 1922, Siva Rao set up a legal practice in Vijayawada while continuing his literary work. He made a special arrangement with the local Ramamohan Library to receive consignments of books from the Connemara Public Library in Madras. His publications began in 1927 with \"Pothana-Vemanala Yugamu\". His historical study in Telugu, \"Dakshinafrika\" (\"South Africa,\" 1929) was dedicated to Gandhi, who knew no Telugu. The latter wrote to him agreeing, in principle, to the dedication, \"provided you do not state anywhere that the dedication is with my permission\".\n\nSiva Rao contributed to the Indian Independence Movement as a writer and historian, as well as professionally as a lawyer. He became a Congress volunteer. He translated into Telugu several Congress circulars from the leadership. He also devised formats to collect information on the prevailing economic conditions in villages. Volunteers collected this information on their visits and gave it to Siva Rao who compiled and analyzed the information. These analyses were then published in the Congress’ periodic bulletins.\n\nIn 1933, he published \"Sahakara Vastu Nilayamu\" (\"Cooperative Stores\"), \"Bharatdesa Stithigatulu\" (\"Comparative Statistics in India\"), and \"Adhinivesha Swarajyamu\" (\"Dominion Status\"). The latter was widely acclaimed. These, and his other books written during this time, were intended to educate the public and Congress workers on political, economic and Constitutional matters.\n\nHe was in charge of publicity for the Congress division of West Krishna District, and wrote many pamphlets, booklets and books, some of which he published on his own, while some were published by the District Congress. His analyses and critiques irked the British-occupation's \"government\", and some of his books and booklets were proscribed. Police searched his house and seized copies of \"Satyagraha Charitra\", \"Nirbhagya Bharatamu\", \"Satyagraha Vijayamu\", \"Daridra Narayaneeyamu\", and \"Satyagraha Bhumi\".\n\nA sedition case was filed against him in 1930, which he contested and won on the grounds that there was no permission from the Governor in Council for his arrest. During the trial of his case, the circle inspector deposed in the court that Siva Rao was present in the Congress office whenever he went to arrest Congressmen and that he rendered legal advice for them and appeared as amicus curiae when they were produced in court. The second case against Siva Rao was filed in 1931 but was later withdrawn under the Gandhi-Irwin pact. He offered his legal services to many Congress volunteers who were arrested during the Salt Satyagraha and produced in court. Some of them were the Gampalagudem Zamindar (Kotagiri Venkata Krishna Rao), N. G. Ranga, and Velidandla Hanumantha Rao.\n\nHe compiled Congress activities in the Madras Province and sent the information for a chapter in the book \"The rise and growth of the Congress in India\" (1938) by C. F. Andrews and Girija Kanta Mookerjee. He condemned the police excesses during the civil disobedience movement and the questions raised by him were tabled in the Madras Legislative Assembly through his advocate friend from Mangalore, and Member of Legislative Council, U. C. Bhat.\n\nSiva Rao also worked in the Cooperative Store movement during this period. He was Secretary for Krishna Cooperative Stores and also Director of Andhra Cooperative Institute. He translated into Telugu the bye-laws and rules of Cooperative Society for Andhra and Gujarat which were printed and circulated. Siva Rao was also the President of Bar Association in the year 1947.\n\nTwo of his books during that period were \"English-Telugu Technical and Scientific Dictionary\" (1934). It was approved by the Government’s Textbook Committee. Three other well-noted books by him published during that period were \"British Rajyatantramu\" (1938), Enugula Veeraswamayya’s \"Kasiyatra Charitra\" (1941), and \"Kadhalu-Gadhalu\" (in four parts, 1944–47). These four books were widely acclaimed.\n\nHis edition of the travelogue \"Kasiyatra Charitra\" (the first two editions appeared in 1838 and 1860) involved considerable research and annotation of the archaic language of the original. For this, he went to the Oriental Manuscripts Library in Madras and studied the first two editions. His edition also incorporated a route map of the journey from Madras to Kasi. Hence he was given copyright to the work.\n\nWhile most of his writings were in Telugu, a few articles were also published in English during this period - \"Christianization of India\" (1940), and \"The Hindu Moslem Civilization of India\" (1941) were published in the bilingual magazine \"Amrutavani\" (\"The Immortal Message\").\n\nSiva Rao was also instrumental in helping other writers to publish. He was closely associated with the Satavadhani Veluri Sivarama Sastry from the early 1920s. The poet had been unable to get his books published. In 1940, Siva Rao had the poet’s \"Ekavali\" printed. Similarly, Basavaraju Apparao’s book \"Apparao Geyalu\" was published posthumously at the instance of Siva Rao.\n\nSiva Rao’s essays appeared in numerous (mostly Telugu) magazines. \"Prajamitra\", \"Korada\", \"Amrita Sandesham\", \"Samadarsini\", \"Grandhalaya Saraswamu\", \"Vasumathi\", \"Prabhatamu\", \"Matrubhumi\", \"Vijayavani\", \"Jaminrytu\", \"Samalochana,\" and \"Andhra Law Journal\" are some of the magazines which published his articles. He often also wrote for the popular daily newspapers: \"Andhra Patrika\", \"Andhra Prabha\", \"Andhra Jyothi\", \"Andhra Bhumi\", and \"Visalandhra\".\n\nAyyadevara Kaleswara Rao, a senior Congressman and Speaker of Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly (1956–62) was an admirer and nominated Siva Rao as a member to many committees which he constituted and chaired during his tenure as Speaker—the Glossary Committee, Editorial Committee, Translation Committee, etc. After Kaleswara Rao’s death in 1962, all those committees continued under P. V. Narasimha Rao who was the state’s Education Minister. Under his chairmanship, the Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Akademi formed a three-member committee for microfilming of manuscripts with Siva Rao as a member.\n\nBut soon Siva Rao resigned, first from Translation Committee protesting impositions of Hindi terms into Telugu. Later on he resigned from the remaining committees as well. Meanwhile, between 1983 (when he turned 85) until 1987, he published 55 articles.\n\nSiva Rao had a considerable collection of documents as source material. Researchers who benefitted from the material included Kothapalli Veerabhadra Rao, Akkiraju Ramapathi Rao, Y. Vithal Rao, Bandi Gopal Reddy (Bangorey). Andhra Pradesh archives sent emissaries to Siva Rao to collect a few rare documents, some of which were on palm leaves.\n\nSeveral books have been dedicated to Siva Rao. Kavisamrat Dr. Viswanadha Satynarayana dedicated his novel \"Pralayanayadu\" (1960) which he wrote based on Siva Rao’s study of the First War of Indian Independence, \"1857 Poorvarangamulu\". The historian Bangorey dedicated his book \"Brown Jabulu\" (1973) and \"Thatachari Kadhalu\" (1975) to Siva Rao. Others who dedicated their books to Siva Rao were N. Gopi and Akkiraju Ramapathi Rao. His last book, \"Veeresalingam Velugu Needalu\" (\"Veeresalingam: Light and Shadows\", 1985), was a critical biography of the social reformer Kandukuri Veeresalingam, published when Siva Rao was 87 years old.\n\n\"Adimanavasula Yudhamulu\" (1958).\n\n\"1857 Poorva Rangamulu\" (1957) (1965).\n\n\"Sanyasula Swatantra Samaramulu\" (1962)\n\n\"Mana Andhratvamu\" (1962).\n\n\"Praja Prabhutvamu\" (1966).\n\n\"Mana Police Vyavstha\" (1966).\n\n\"The Rule of Law and the Bezwada Bar\" (1975).\n\n\"Visalndhramu-Vismrutandhramu\" (1980).\n\n\"Veeresalingam Velugu Needalu\" (1985).\n"}

Nilgiri Press has published over thirty books that he authored.\n\nEaswaran was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, whom he met when he was a young man. Easwaran developed a method of meditation – silent repetition in the mind of memorized inspirational passages from the world's major religious and spiritual traditions – which later came to be known as Passage Meditation.\n\nEknath Easwaran was born in 1910 in a village in Kerala, India. \n\"Eknath\" is his surname, \"Easwaran\" his given name. Brought up by his mother, and by his maternal grandmother whom he honored as his spiritual teacher, he was schooled in his native village until the age of sixteen, when he went to attend a Catholic college fifty miles away. Here he acquired a deep appreciation of the Christian tradition. He graduated at the University of Nagpur in English and law. He served as Professor of English literature at the University of Nagpur.\n\nIn 1959, he came to the United States as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nFrom 1960 he gave classes on meditation in the San Francisco Bay Area. He met his wife Christine at one of these talks. Together with his wife, he founded the Blue Mountain Center of Meditation in 1961. After a four-year stay in India, he returned to the Bay Area in 1965.\n\nIn 1970 he founded \"Ramagiri Ashram\" as a community of dedicated followers in Marin County.\n\nHe set up a publishing activity, Nilgiri Press, which printed his first book \"Gandhi The Man\", telling the story of Gandhi as a spiritual as well as a political leader. His first major work was his 3-volume commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, the \"Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living\", the first volume of which was printed in 1975 and the last in 1984. His book \"Meditation\" on the program of meditation and allied disciplines that he developed first appeared in 1978. By 2018, his methods of spiritual practice had been the focus of two major scientific research programs that had produced thirty refereed research reports.\n\nEaswaran's written works may be grouped into several major categories—primarily books, but also articles in newspapers and other periodicals. Most of his books have been reviewed by spiritually oriented publications or websites, or by nationally known media such as \"The New Yorker\", or the \"New York Post\".\n\nIn addition, a large number of Easwaran's recorded talks have been published in video and audio formats.\n\nEaswaran's translations of the \"Bhagavad Gita\", the \"Upanishads\", and the \"Dhammapada\" (see article) have been critically acclaimed. Religion scholar Huston Smith is cited by the publisher as writing: \"No one in modern times is more qualified – no, make that 'as qualified' – to translate the epochal Classics of Indian Spirituality than Eknath Easwaran. And the reason is clear. It is impossible to get to the heart of those classics unless you live them, and he did live them. My admiration of the man and his works is boundless.\"\nIn \"Buddhism: A Concise Introduction\" Smith and his coauthor Philip Novak wrote that \"Our favorite translation is Eknath Easwaran's \"The Dhammapada\". His Indian heritage, literary gifts, and spiritual sensibilities... here produce a sublime rendering of the words of the Buddha. Verse after verse shimmers with quiet, confident authority. A bonus is the sparkling 70-page introduction to the Buddha's life and teachings.\"\n\n\"Essence of the Upanishads\" (see article), originally entitled \"Dialogue with death: The spiritual psychology of the Katha Upanishad\", explains how the Katha Upanishad embraces the key ideas of Indian spirituality within the context of a powerful mythic quest – the story of a young hero who ventures into the land of death in search of immortality. \"\"Essence of the Upanishads\" is a westerner's guide to this vitally important Indian text and its modern relevance to the Indian mindset and spirituality.\"\n\nIn \"Essence of the Bhagavad Gita\", Easwaran places the Gita’s teachings in a modern context and comments on the Gita's view of the nature of reality, the illusion of separateness, the search for identity, the meaning of yoga, and how to heal the unconscious. The book views the key message of the Gita as how to resolve our conflicts and live in harmony with the deep unity of life, through the practice of meditation and spiritual disciplines.\n\nIn \"Essence of the Dhammapada\", Easwaran comments on the Dhammapada, sayings attributed to the Buddha himself, presenting it as a guide that gives straightforward teachings about spiritual perseverance, progress, and enlightenment.\n\nHis book \"Passage Meditation\" (original title \"Meditation\") describes the Eight Point Program that Easwaran developed, while his book \"Conquest of Mind\" goes further into the practice of these disciplines in daily life. \"Timeless Wisdom\" is a companion book to \"Passage Meditation\" and contains passages for meditation drawn from across the world's spiritual traditions. His book \"Mantram Handbook: a practical guide to choosing your mantram and calming your mind\" addresses The Mantram, the second point in the program.\n\nHis book \"Strength in the Storm\" is an introduction to The Mantram, containing many stories and practical examples to help the reader learn how to harness the inner resources for dealing with challenges in daily living. His book \"Take Your Time\" explores \"Slowing Down\" and \"One-Pointed Attention\" in daily lives. \"Renewal\" is a pocket book of short readings on themes such as loving relationships, raising children, living simply, and aging wisely; \"Patience\", the second in the pocket book series, shows how to cultivate Patience – \"the ornament of the brave\" – at any age. Other (older) books describe various aspects of leading a spiritual life: \"Climbing the Blue Mountain\", \"Compassionate Universe\", and \"Undiscovered Country\".\n\n\"God Makes the Rivers to Flow\" is an anthology of writings from the sacred literature of the world, selected by Easwaran as useful for meditation. A larger (and earlier) version of \"Timeless Wisdom\", it contains dozens of passages from diverse traditions, and identifies passages for particular stages in life, such as caregiving, families with small children, death and dying, grief and loss, and for building positive qualities such as patience, courage, devotion to God, and putting others first. \"Words to Live By\" is a set of daily readings with Easwaran's commentary on applying the reading to daily life.\n\nThe three volumes of the \"Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living\" are conceived as handbooks for applying the teachings of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" to lives today. \"End of Sorrow\" concentrates on the individual – how one can discover one's innermost nature, and transform one's life through self-realization, selfless service, and meditation. \"Like a Thousand Suns\" addresses relationships – how one can heal divisions in society, within one's relationships, and within oneself, and realize the unity governing all creation. \"To Love is To Know Me\" gives a global view, describing what individual readers can do to make a difference in the world today, and ends with a description of bhakti yoga, the path of devotions.\n\n\"Gandhi the Man\" traces how Mohandas Gandhi transformed himself into one of the world's great spiritual leaders.\n\n\"Nonviolent Soldier of Islam\" is the life story of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a Pathan (or Pushtun) of Afghanistan and a devout Muslim, who raised the first nonviolent army in history to free his people from British imperial rule. This book was favorably discussed in \"The New Yorker\". The book also inspired filmmaker and writer T.C. McLuhan, daughter of Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan, to make the film \"The Frontier Gandhi: Badshah Khan, a Torch for Peace\", which won the 2009 Black Pearl Award for Best Documentary Film.\n\n\"Original Goodness\" (see article) is a commentary on the Beatitudes. \"Love Never Faileth\" (see article) is a commentary on the writings of St Francis, St Paul, St Augustine, and Mother Teresa. \"Seeing with the Eyes of Love\" (see article) is a commentary on \"The Imitation of Christ\".\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Easwaran published a variety of commentaries on public events in prominent periodicals, especially the \n\"Christian Science Monitor\",\nand also in \"The New York Times\", \nelsewhere in the US,\nand internationally.\nHe also wrote numerous commentaries that appeared in the \"Little Lamp\" (1961–1995), and in \"Blue Mountain\" (1990–present), quarterly journals published by the meditation center that he founded. In the 1960s, Easwaran published articles in other spiritual journals, such as the \"Mountain Path\", published by Sri Ramana Maharshi's ashram.\nBefore coming to the US in 1959, Easwaran contributed short stories and other writings to literary anthologies, and to magazines such as \"The Illustrated Weekly of India\".\n\nMany of Easwaran's recorded talks have been published in video and audio formats.\n\nSeveral dozen of Easwaran's talks have been published as video DVDs, and now as downloadable MP4s as a free subscription from the Blue Mountain Center. \nBefore publication as DVDs, videos of Easwaran's talks were first released in VHS videotape format.\nSome talks are published in downloadable audio/MP3 formats.\nInstructions for meditation by Easwaran have been published in audio form as CDs. Some of Easwaran's talks were earlier published as cassette tapes or LP records. \nMagazines have reviewed some of Easwaran's published talks, both audio\nand video,\nsince the 1990s.\n\nSeveral of Easwaran's written works, including \"Essence of the Upanishads\", \"Passage Meditation – A Complete Spiritual Practice\", \"The Bhagavad Gita\", \"The Dhammapada\" and \"Gandhi the Man\", have been published as audio books, as voice-recorded by the British actor Paul Bazely, and also the philosopher Jacob Needleman\n\nEaswaran's program for spiritual growth consists of eight points, and is described comprehensively in his book \"Passage Meditation – A Complete Spiritual Practice\" (originally published in 1978 as \"Meditation\"). Each point had a dedicated chapter:\n\nA variety of influences of Easwaran's life and work have been documented. Easwaran's students, inspired in part by his teachings about compassion and stewardship for the environment, published a well-known vegetarian cookbook entitled \"Laurel's Kitchen\" (1976), later republished in revised form as \"The New Laurel's Kitchen\" (1986). The book contained extensive nutritional information from a scientific point of view, and sold more than a million copies.\n\nOutside of the US, Easwaran's life and teachings were profiled, along with those of a variety of other spiritual teachers, in a book published in India entitled \"Meditation Masters and their Insights\".\n\nEaswaran's words have been included in collections of wisdom teachings, such as ones recently published by Chang (2006) and Parachin (2011).\nQuotations from Easwaran's translations have been used many times by both scholarly and popular writers.\nEaswaran's other writings have also been quoted by various types of authors, including writers of novels and short stories,\npopular spirituality,\nand articles on management theory.\nPsychiatrist Aaron Beck and his colleagues quoted from Easwaran's commentary on the Katha Upanishad.\nThe \"NAPRA ReView\" wrote that \"The volume of [Easwaran's] work and the quality of his discourse suggest a man who has had a profound impact on the spiritual lives of many.\"\n\nEaswaran's method of passage meditation was followed by the poet Robert Lax. Near the end of his life, Lax's only reading each day was from Easwaran's book \"Words to Live By\".\n\nNew Hampshire State Representative Latha Mangipudi reported having given then-Senator Barack Obama a copy of Easwaran's book \"Gandhi the Man\" in December 2006.\n\nEaswaran has been listed in reference works on spiritual and religious leaders.\n\nIn his survey of commentaries on the \"Bhagavad Gita\", Nadkarni described Easwaran as \"respected worldwide as one of the most profound writers and orators on religion and spirituality\".\n\nEaswaran's books, initially written in English, have also been translated into more than 20 other languages, and published in non-US editions by indigenous (non-US) publishers. Languages in which his books are currently in print include Bahasa Indonesian, Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovenian, Spanish, and Telugu. His books have also been translated into Chinese (PRC).\n\nFrom 2011, a number of Easwaran's books and articles were excerpted and republished as the series of short ebooks \"Easwaran Inspirations\":\nContributions to works by others include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "153734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153734", "title": "Georgian language", "text": "Georgian language\n\nGeorgian (ქართული ენა, , ) is a Kartvelian language spoken by Georgians. It is the official language of Georgia.\n\nGeorgian is written in its own writing system, the Georgian script.\n\nGeorgian is the literary language for all regional subgroups of Georgians, including those who speak other Kartvelian languages: Svans, Mingrelians and the Laz.\n\nGeorgian is the most pervasive of the Kartvelian languages, a family that also includes Svan and Megrelian (chiefly spoken in Northwest Georgia) and Laz (chiefly spoken along the Black Sea coast of Turkey, from Melyat, Rize, to the Georgian frontier).\n\nDialects of Georgian are from Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi, Guria, Adjara, Imerkhevi (in Turkey), Kartli, Kakheti, Saingilo (in Azerbaijan), Tusheti, Khevsureti, Khevi, Pshavi, Fereydan (in Iran), Mtiuleti and Meskheti.\n\nThe history of the Georgian language can conventionally be divided into:\n\nGeorgian shares an ancestral language with Mingrelian/Laz and Svan. Georgian as separate from the other Kartvelian languages would have emerged in the 1st millennium BC in the area known later as the Kingdom of Iberia. The earliest allusion to spoken Georgian may be a passage of the Roman grammarian Marcus Cornelius Fronto in the 2nd century: Fronto imagines the Iberians addressing the emperor Marcus Aurelius in their \"incomprehensible tongue\".\n\nThe evolution of Georgian into a written language was a consequence of the conversion of the Georgian elite to Christianity in the mid-4th century. The new literary language was constructed on an already well-established cultural infrastructure, appropriating the functions, conventions, and status of Aramaic, the literary language of pagan Georgia, and the new national religion. The first Georgian texts are inscriptions and palimpsests dating to the 5th century. Georgian has a rich literary tradition. The oldest surviving literary work in Georgian is the 5th century \"Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik\" () by Iakob Tsurtaveli.\nIn the 11th century, Old Georgian gives rise to Middle Georgian, the literary language of the medieval kingdom of Georgia. The Georgian national epic, Shota Rustaveli's \"The Knight in the Panther's Skin\" (), dates from the 12th century.\n\nIn 1629, \"Alphabetum Ibericum sive Georgianum cum Oratione\" and \"Dittionario giorgiano e italiano\" were the first two books printed in the Georgian language using movable type in Rome supported by the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples of the Catholic Church for their evangelical movement in Georgian kingdoms. This marked the beginning of the modern Georgian language.\n\nSymbols on the left are those of the and those on the right are of the modern Georgian alphabet.\n\nFormer () has merged with (), leaving only the latter.\n\nThe glottalization of the ejectives is rather light, and in many romanization systems it is not marked, for transcriptions such as ejective \"p\", \"t\", \"ts\", \"ch\", \"k\" and \"q\", against aspirated \"p‘\", \"t‘\", \"ts‘\", \"ch‘\" and \"k‘\" (as in transcriptions of Armenian).\n\nThe coronal occlusives (, not necessarily affricates) are variously described as apical dental, laminal alveolar, and \"dental\".\n\nProsody in Georgian involves stress, intonation, and rhythm. Stress is very weak, and linguists disagree as to where stress occurs in words. Jun, Vicenik, and Lofstedt have proposed that Georgian stress and intonation are the result of pitch accents on the first syllable of a word and near the end of a phrase. The rhythm of Georgian speech is syllable-timed.\n\nGeorgian contains many \"harmonic clusters\" involving two consonants of a similar type (voiced, aspirated, or ejective) which are pronounced with only a single release; e.g. \"bgera\" (sound), \"tskhovreba\" (life), and \"ts'q'ali\" (water). There are also frequent consonant clusters, sometimes involving more than six consonants in a row, as may be seen in words like \"gvprtskvni\" (\"You peel us\") and \"mts'vrtneli\" (\"trainer\").\n\nVicenik has observed that Georgian vowels following ejective stops have creaky voice and suggests this may be one cue distinguishing ejectives from their aspirated and voiced counterparts.\n\nGeorgian has been written in a variety of scripts over its history. Currently the \"Mkhedruli\" or \"Military\" script is almost completely dominant; the others are used mostly in religious documents and architecture.\n\n\"Mkhedruli\" has 33 letters in common use; a half dozen more are obsolete in Georgian, though still used in other alphabets, like Mingrelian, Laz, and Svan. The letters of \"Mkhedruli\" correspond closely to the phonemes of the Georgian language.\n\nAccording to the traditional account written down by Leonti Mroveli in the 11th century, the first Georgian script was created by the first ruler of the Kingdom of Iberia, Pharnavaz, in the 3rd century BC. However, the first examples of a Georgian script date from the 5th century AD. There are now three Georgian scripts, called \"Asomtavruli\" \"capitals\", \"Nuskhuri\" \"small letters\", and \"Mkhedruli\". The first two are used together as upper and lower case in the writings of the Georgian Orthodox Church and together are called \"Khutsuri\" \"priests' [alphabet]\".\n\nIn \"Mkhedruli\", there is no case. Sometimes, however, a capital-like effect, called \"Mtavruli\", \"title\" or \"heading\", is achieved by modifying the letters so that their vertical sizes are identical and they rest on the baseline with no descenders. These capital-like letters are often used in page headings, chapter titles, monumental inscriptions, and the like.\n\nThis is the Georgian standard keyboard layout. The standard Windows keyboard is essentially that of manual typewriters.\n\nGeorgian is an agglutinative language. There are certain prefixes and suffixes that are joined together in order to build a verb. In some cases, there can be up to eight different morphemes in one verb at the same time. An example can be \"ageshenebinat\" (\"you (pl) had built\"). The verb can be broken down to parts: \"a-g-e-shen-eb-in-a-t\". Each morpheme here contributes to the meaning of the verb tense or the person who has performed the verb. The verb conjugation also exhibits polypersonalism; a verb may potentially include morphemes representing both the subject and the object.\n\nIn Georgian morphophonology, syncope is a common phenomenon. When a suffix (especially the plural suffix -\"eb\"-) is attached to a word which has either of the vowels \"a\" or \"e\" in the last syllable, this vowel is, in most words, lost. For example, \"megobari\" means \"friend\". To say \"friends\", one says, \"megobØrebi\" (\"megobrebi\"), with the loss of \"a\" in the last syllable of the word root.\n\nGeorgian has seven noun cases: nominative, ergative, dative, genitive, instrumental, adverbial and vocative. An interesting feature of Georgian is that, while the subject of a sentence is generally in the nominative case, and the object is in the accusative case (or dative), in Georgian, one can find this reversed in many situations (this depends mainly on the character of the verb). This is called the dative construction. In the past tense of the transitive verbs, and in the present tense of the verb \"to know\", the subject is in the ergative case.\n\n\nGeorgian has a rich word-derivation system. By using a root, and adding some definite prefixes and suffixes, one can derive many nouns and adjectives from the root. For example, from the root -\"kartv\"-, the following words can be derived: \"Kartveli (a Georgian person), \"Kartuli (the Georgian language) and Sakartvelo (Georgia).\n\nMost Georgian surnames end in -\"dze\" (\"son\") (Western Georgia), -\"shvili\" (\"child\") (Eastern Georgia), -\"ia\" (Western Georgia, Samegrelo), -\"ani\" (Western Georgia, Svaneti), -\"uri\" (Eastern Georgia), etc. The ending -\"eli\" is a particle of nobility, equivalent to French \"de\", German \"von\" or Polish -\"ski\".\n\nGeorgian has a vigesimal numeric system like Basque or French, based on the counting system of 20. In order to express a number greater than 20 and less than 100, first the number of 20s in the number is stated and the remaining number is added. For example, 93 is expressed as - \"otkh-m-ots-da-tsamet'i\" (lit. four-times-twenty-and-thirteen).\n\nOne of the most important Georgian dictionaries is the \"Explanatory dictionary of the Georgian language\" (Georgian: ). It consists of eight volumes and about 115,000 words. It was produced between 1950 and 1964, by a team of linguists under the direction of Arnold Chikobava.\n\nGeorgian has a word derivation system, which allows the derivation of nouns from verb roots both with prefixes and suffixes, for example:\n\n\nIt is also possible to derive verbs from nouns:\n\n\nLikewise, verbs can be derived from adjectives, for example:\n\n\nIn Georgian many nouns and adjectives begin with two or more contiguous consonants. This is because most syllables in the language begin with certain two consonants. \n\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Georgian:\n\nQ'vela adamiani ibadeba tavisupali da tanasts'ori tavisi ghirsebita da uplebebit.

Typically, they are adjectives or adverbs, but can also consist of clauses such as one use of tag questions. It could be regarded as a form of euphemism. Hedges are considered in linguistics to be tools of epistemic modality; allowing the speaker to signal his or her degree of confidence in a connected assertion. Hedges are also used to distinguish items into multiple categories, where items can be in a certain category to an extent.\n\nHedges may take the form of many different parts of speech, for example:\n\n\nIn some cases\", \"I don't know\"\" functions as a prepositioned hedge—a forward-looking stance marker displaying that the speaker is not fully committed to what follows in their turn of talkHedges may intentionally or unintentionally be employed in both spoken and written language since they are crucially important in communication. Hedges help speakers and writers indicate more precisely how the cooperative principle (expectations of quantity, quality, manner, and relevance) is observed in assessments. For example,\n\n\nHedges are used as a tool of communication and are found in all of the world's languages. Examples of hedges in languages besides English are as follow:\n\n\nFuzzy language means that it is unclear or vague. Hedges can make sentences fuzzy or less fuzzy.

{"id": "15924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15924", "title": "Julius Caesar", "text": "Julius Caesar\n\nGaius Julius Caesar (; ; 12 or 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), known by his nomen and cognomen Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He is also known as an author of Latin prose.\n\nIn 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as \"Populares\" were opposed by the \"Optimates\" within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a number of his accomplishments, notably his victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC. During this time, Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the Channel and the Rhine, when he built a bridge across the Rhine and crossed the Channel to invade Britain. Caesar's wars extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Leaving his command in Gaul meant losing his immunity from being charged as a criminal for waging unsanctioned wars. As a result, Caesar found himself with no other options but to cross the Rubicon with the 13th Legion, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. Civil war resulted, and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence.\n\nAfter assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar. He gave citizenship to many residents of far regions of the Roman Empire. He initiated land reform and support for veterans. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator in perpetuity\", giving him additional authority. His populist and authoritarian reforms angered the elites, who began to conspire against him. On the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Gaius Cassius Longinus, Marcus Junius Brutus and Decimus Junius Brutus. A new series of civil wars broke out and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power and the era of the Roman Empire began.\n\nMuch of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history. His cognomen was subsequently adopted as a synonym for \"Emperor\"; the title \"Caesar\" was used throughout the Roman Empire, giving rise to modern cognates such as Kaiser or Tsar. He has frequently appeared in literary and artistic works, and his political philosophy, known as \"Caesarism\" inspired politicians into the modern era.\n\nCaesar was born into a patrician family, the \"gens Julia\", which claimed descent from Iulus, son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly the son of the goddess Venus. The Julii were of Alban origin, mentioned as one of the leading Alban houses, which settled in Rome after the destruction of Alba Longa. The Julii also existed at an early period at Bovillae, evidenced by a very ancient inscription on an altar in the theatre of that town, which speaks of their offering sacrifices according to the \"lege Albana\", or Alban rites. The \"cognomen\" \"Caesar\" originated, according to Pliny the Elder, with an ancestor who was born by Caesarean section (from the Latin verb to cut, \"caedere\", \"caes-\"). The \"Historia Augusta\" suggests three alternative explanations: that the first Caesar had a thick head of hair (Latin \"caesaries\"); that he had bright grey eyes (Latin \"oculis caesiis\"); or that he killed an elephant (\"caesai\" in Moorish) in battle. Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favored this interpretation of his name.\n\nDespite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential, although they had enjoyed some revival of their political fortunes in the early 1st century BC. Caesar's father, also called Gaius Julius Caesar, governed the province of Asia, and his sister Julia, Caesar's aunt, married Gaius Marius, one of the most prominent figures in the Republic. His mother, Aurelia Cotta, came from an influential family. Little is recorded of Caesar's childhood.\n\nIn 85 BC, Caesar's father died suddenly, so Caesar was the head of the family at 16. His coming of age coincided with a civil war between his uncle Gaius Marius and his rival Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Both sides carried out bloody purges of their political opponents whenever they were in the ascendancy. Marius and his ally Lucius Cornelius Cinna were in control of the city when Caesar was nominated as the new Flamen Dialis (high priest of Jupiter), and he was married to Cinna's daughter Cornelia.\n\nFollowing Sulla's final victory, though, Caesar's connections to the old regime made him a target for the new one. He was stripped of his inheritance, his wife's dowry, and his priesthood, but he refused to divorce Cornelia and was forced to go into hiding. The threat against him was lifted by the intervention of his mother's family, which included supporters of Sulla, and the Vestal Virgins. Sulla gave in reluctantly and is said to have declared that he saw many a Marius in Caesar. Ironically, the loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.\n\nCaesar felt that it would be much safer far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, so he left Rome and joined the army, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia. He served with distinction, winning the Civic Crown for his part in the Siege of Mytilene. He went on a mission to Bithynia to secure the assistance of King Nicomedes's fleet, but he spent so long at Nicomedes' court that rumours arose of an affair with the king, which Caesar vehemently denied for the rest of his life.\n\nHearing of Sulla's death in 78 BC, Caesar felt safe enough to return to Rome. He lacked means since his inheritance was confiscated, but he acquired a modest house in Subura, a lower-class neighbourhood of Rome. He turned to legal advocacy and became known for his exceptional oratory accompanied by impassioned gestures and a high-pitched voice, and ruthless prosecution of former governors notorious for extortion and corruption.\nOn the way across the Aegean Sea, Caesar was kidnapped by pirates and held prisoner. He maintained an attitude of superiority throughout his captivity. The pirates demanded a ransom of 20 talents of silver, but he insisted that they ask for 50. After the ransom was paid, Caesar raised a fleet, pursued and captured the pirates, and imprisoned them. He had them crucified on his own authority, as he had promised while in captivity—a promise that the pirates had taken as a joke. As a sign of leniency, he first had their throats cut. He was soon called back into military action in Asia, raising a band of auxiliaries to repel an incursion from the east.\n\nOn his return to Rome, he was elected military tribune, a first step in a political career. He was elected \"quaestor\" for 69 BC, and during that year he delivered the funeral oration for his aunt Julia, and included images of her husband Marius in the funeral procession, unseen since the days of Sulla. His wife Cornelia also died that year. Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in Spain after her funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC. While there, he is said to have encountered a statue of Alexander the Great, and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. On his return in 67 BC, he married Pompeia, a granddaughter of Sulla, whom he later divorced in 61 BC after her embroilment in the Bona Dea scandal. In 65 BC, he was elected curule aedile, and staged lavish games that won him further attention and popular support.\n\nIn 63 BC, he ran for election to the post of \"Pontifex Maximus\", chief priest of the Roman state religion. He ran against two powerful senators. Accusations of bribery were made by all sides. Caesar won comfortably, despite his opponents' greater experience and standing. Cicero was consul that year, and he exposed Catiline's conspiracy to seize control of the republic; several senators accused Caesar of involvement in the plot.\n\nAfter serving as \"praetor\" in 62 BC, Caesar was appointed to govern Hispania Ulterior (modern south-eastern Spain) as \"propraetor\", though some sources suggest that he held proconsular powers. He was still in considerable debt and needed to satisfy his creditors before he could leave. He turned to Marcus Licinius Crassus, one of Rome's richest men. Crassus paid some of Caesar's debts and acted as guarantor for others, in return for political support in his opposition to the interests of Pompey. Even so, to avoid becoming a private citizen and thus open to prosecution for his debts, Caesar left for his province before his praetorship had ended. In Spain, he conquered two local tribes and was hailed as \"imperator\" by his troops; he reformed the law regarding debts, and completed his governorship in high esteem.\n\nCaesar was acclaimed \"Imperator\" in 60 and 45 BC. In the Roman Republic, this was an honorary title assumed by certain military commanders. After an especially great victory, army troops in the field would proclaim their commander \"imperator\", an acclamation necessary for a general to apply to the Senate for a triumph. However, he also wanted to stand for consul, the most senior magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. He asked the senate for permission to stand \"in absentia\", but Cato blocked the proposal. Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.\n\nIn 60 BC, Caesar sought election as consul for 59 BC, along with two other candidates. The election was sordid – even Cato, with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in favour of one of Caesar's opponents. Caesar won, along with conservative Marcus Bibulus.\n\nCaesar was already in Crassus' political debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (\"rule of three men\"), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, who was the daughter of another powerful senator.\n\nCaesar proposed a law for redistributing public lands to the poor—by force of arms, if need be—a proposal supported by Pompey and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, a move which intimidated the triumvirate's opponents. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavourable and thus void the new law, but he was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His lictors had their fasces broken, two high magistrates accompanying him were wounded, and he had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts proved ineffective in obstructing Caesar's legislation. Roman satirists ever after referred to the year as \"the consulship of Julius and Caesar.\"\n\nWhen Caesar was first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit his future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than the governorship of a province, as his military command duty after his year in office was over. With the help of political allies, Caesar later overturned this, and was instead appointed to govern Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) and Illyricum (southeastern Europe), with Transalpine Gaul (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one. When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province.\n\nCaesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of Gaul were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the Battle of Magetobriga, with the help of a contingent of Germanic tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes.\n\nIn response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north, directly opposite Britain. During the spring of 56 BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The Lucca Conference renewed the First Triumvirate and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years. The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained. Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain.\n\nIn 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year, possibly the Veneti of Brittany. His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter. He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time.\nWhile Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed invasion of the east. Rome was on the brink of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead.\n\nThough the Gallic tribes were just as strong as the Romans militarily, the internal division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. Vercingetorix's attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late. He proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar in several engagements, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the Battle of Alesia finally forced his surrender. Despite scattered outbreaks of warfare the following year, Gaul was effectively conquered. Plutarch claimed that during the Gallic Wars the army had fought against three million men (of whom one million died, and another million were enslaved), subjugated 300 tribes, and destroyed 800 cities.\n\nIn 50 BC, the Senate (led by Pompey) ordered Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor had finished. Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate. Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason. On January 10, 49 BC, Caesar crossed the Rubicon river (the frontier boundary of Italy) with only a single legion, the Legio XIII Gemina, and ignited civil war. Upon crossing the Rubicon, Caesar, according to Plutarch and Suetonius, is supposed to have quoted the Athenian playwright Menander, in Greek, \"the die is cast\". Erasmus, however, notes that the more accurate Latin translation of the Greek imperative mood would be \"alea iacta esto\", \"let\" the die be cast. Pompey and many of the Senate fled to the south, having little confidence in Pompey's newly raised troops. Pompey, despite greatly outnumbering Caesar, who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him, did not intend to fight. Caesar pursued Pompey, hoping to capture Pompey before his legions could escape.\n\nPompey managed to escape before Caesar could capture him. Heading for Spain, Caesar left Italy under the control of Mark Antony. After an astonishing 27-day route-march, Caesar defeated Pompey's lieutenants, then returned east, to challenge Pompey in Illyria, where, in July 48 BC in the battle of Dyrrhachium, Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat. In an exceedingly short engagement later that year, he decisively defeated Pompey at Pharsalus, in Greece.\n\nIn Rome, Caesar was appointed dictator, with Mark Antony as his Master of the Horse (second in command); Caesar presided over his own election to a second consulship and then, after 11 days, resigned this dictatorship. Caesar then pursued Pompey to Egypt, arriving soon after the murder of the general. There, Caesar was presented with Pompey's severed head and seal-ring, receiving these with tears. He then had Pompey's assassins put to death.\n\nCaesar then became involved with an Egyptian civil war between the child pharaoh and his sister, wife, and co-regent queen, Cleopatra. Perhaps as a result of the pharaoh's role in Pompey's murder, Caesar sided with Cleopatra. He withstood the Siege of Alexandria and later he defeated the pharaoh's forces at the Battle of the Nile in 47 BC and installed Cleopatra as ruler. Caesar and Cleopatra celebrated their victory with a triumphal procession on the Nile in the spring of 47 BC. The royal barge was accompanied by 400 additional ships, and Caesar was introduced to the luxurious lifestyle of the Egyptian pharaohs.\n\nCaesar and Cleopatra were not married. Caesar continued his relationship with Cleopatra throughout his last marriage—in Roman eyes, this did not constitute adultery—and probably fathered a son called Caesarion. Cleopatra visited Rome on more than one occasion, residing in Caesar's villa just outside Rome across the Tiber.\n\nLate in 48 BC, Caesar was again appointed dictator, with a term of one year. After spending the first months of 47 BC in Egypt, Caesar went to the Middle East, where he annihilated the king of Pontus; his victory was so swift and complete that he mocked Pompey's previous victories over such poor enemies. On his way to Pontus, Caesar visited Tarsus from 27 to 29 May 47 BC (25–27 May), where he met enthusiastic support, but where, according to Cicero, Cassius was planning to kill him at this point. Thence, he proceeded to Africa to deal with the remnants of Pompey's senatorial supporters. He quickly gained a significant victory in 46 BC over Cato, who then committed suicide.\n\nAfter this victory, he was appointed dictator for 10 years. Pompey's sons escaped to Spain; Caesar gave chase and defeated the last remnants of opposition in the Battle of Munda in March 45 BC. During this time, Caesar was elected to his third and fourth terms as consul in 46 BC and 45 BC (this last time without a colleague).\n\nWhile he was still campaigning in Spain, the Senate began bestowing honours on Caesar. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, and there was no serious public opposition to him. Great games and celebrations were held in April to honour Caesar's victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans. On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus would be the next heir in succession. In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome.\n\nDuring his early career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and dysfunctional the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery had broken down under the weight of imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. With a weak central government, political corruption had spiralled out of control, and the \"status quo\" had been maintained by a corrupt aristocracy, which saw no need to change a system that had made its members rich.\n\nBetween his crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the Republic. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. Finally, he wanted to knit together all of the provinces into a single cohesive unit.\n\nThe first goal was accomplished when Caesar defeated Pompey and his supporters. To accomplish the other two goals, he needed to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed, so he assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Finally, he enacted a series of reforms that were meant to address several long-neglected issues, the most important of which was his reform of the calendar.\n\nWhen Caesar returned to Rome, the Senate granted him triumphs for his victories, ostensibly those over Gaul, Egypt, Pharnaces, and Juba, rather than over his Roman opponents. Not everything went Caesar's way. When Arsinoe IV, Egypt's former queen, was paraded in chains, the spectators admired her dignified bearing and were moved to pity. Triumphal games were held, with beast-hunts involving 400 lions, and gladiator contests. A naval battle was held on a flooded basin at the Field of Mars. At the Circus Maximus, two armies of war captives, each of 2,000 people, 200 horses, and 20 elephants, fought to the death. Again, some bystanders complained, this time at Caesar's wasteful extravagance. A riot broke out, and only stopped when Caesar had two rioters sacrificed by the priests on the Field of Mars.\n\nAfter the triumph, Caesar set out to pass an ambitious legislative agenda. He ordered a census be taken, which forced a reduction in the grain dole, and decreed that jurors could only come from the Senate or the equestrian ranks. He passed a sumptuary law that restricted the purchase of certain luxuries. After this, he passed a law that rewarded families for having many children, to speed up the repopulation of Italy. Then, he outlawed professional guilds, except those of ancient foundation, since many of these were subversive political clubs. He then passed a term-limit law applicable to governors. He passed a debt-restructuring law, which ultimately eliminated about a fourth of all debts owed.\n\nThe Forum of Caesar, with its Temple of Venus Genetrix, was then built, among many other public works. Caesar also tightly regulated the purchase of state-subsidised grain and reduced the number of recipients to a fixed number, all of whom were entered into a special register. From 47 to 44 BC, he made plans for the distribution of land to about 15,000 of his veterans.\n\nThe most important change, however, was his reform of the calendar. The calendar was then regulated by the movement of the moon, and this had left it in a mess. Caesar replaced this calendar with the Egyptian calendar, which was regulated by the sun. He set the length of the year to 365.25 days by adding an intercalary/leap day at the end of February every fourth year.\n\nTo bring the calendar into alignment with the seasons, he decreed that three extra months be inserted into 46 BC (the ordinary intercalary month at the end of February, and two extra months after November). Thus, the Julian calendar opened on 1 January 45 BC. This calendar is almost identical to the current Western calendar.\n\nShortly before his assassination, he passed a few more reforms. He established a police force, appointed officials to carry out his land reforms, and ordered the rebuilding of Carthage and Corinth. He also extended Latin rights throughout the Roman world, and then abolished the tax system and reverted to the earlier version that allowed cities to collect tribute however they wanted, rather than needing Roman intermediaries. His assassination prevented further and larger schemes, which included the construction of an unprecedented temple to Mars, a huge theatre, and a library on the scale of the Library of Alexandria.\n\nHe also wanted to convert Ostia to a major port, and cut a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth. Militarily, he wanted to conquer the Dacians and Parthians, and avenge the loss at Carrhae. Thus, he instituted a massive mobilisation. Shortly before his assassination, the Senate named him censor for life and Father of the Fatherland, and the month of Quintilis was renamed July in his honour.\n\nHe was granted further honours, which were later used to justify his assassination as a would-be divine monarch: coins were issued bearing his image and his statue was placed next to those of the kings. He was granted a golden chair in the Senate, was allowed to wear triumphal dress whenever he chose, and was offered a form of semi-official or popular cult, with Mark Antony as his high priest.\n\nThe history of Caesar's political appointments is complex and uncertain. Caesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate, but alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship. His powers within the state seem to have rested upon these magistracies. He was first appointed dictator in 49 BC, possibly to preside over elections, but resigned his dictatorship within 11 days. In 48 BC, he was reappointed dictator, only this time for an indefinite period, and in 46 BC, he was appointed dictator for 10 years.\n\nIn 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers, which made his person sacrosanct and allowed him to veto the Senate, although on at least one occasion, tribunes did attempt to obstruct him. The offending tribunes in this case were brought before the Senate and divested of their office. This was not the first time Caesar had violated a tribune's sacrosanctity. After he had first marched on Rome in 49 BC, he forcibly opened the treasury, although a tribune had the seal placed on it. After the impeachment of the two obstructive tribunes, Caesar, perhaps unsurprisingly, faced no further opposition from other members of the Tribunician College.\n\nWhen Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, the ranks of the Senate had been severely depleted, so he used his censorial powers to appoint many new senators, which eventually raised the Senate's membership to 900. All the appointments were of his own partisans, which robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made the Senate increasingly subservient to him. To minimise the risk that another general might attempt to challenge him, Caesar passed a law that subjected governors to term limits.\n\nIn 46 BC, Caesar gave himself the title of \"Prefect of the Morals\", which was an office that was new only in name, as its powers were identical to those of the \"censors\". Thus, he could hold censorial powers, while technically not subjecting himself to the same checks to which the ordinary censors were subject, and he used these powers to fill the Senate with his own partisans. He also set the precedent, which his imperial successors followed, of requiring the Senate to bestow various titles and honours upon him. He was, for example, given the title of \"Father of the Fatherland\" and \"imperator\".\n\nCoins bore his likeness, and he was given the right to speak first during Senate meetings. Caesar then increased the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters.\n\nCaesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to link more tightly the other provinces of the empire into a single cohesive unit. This addressed the underlying problem that had caused the Social War decades earlier, where persons from outside Rome or Italy did not have citizenship. This process, of fusing the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the Emperor Augustus.\n\nIn February 44 BC, one month before his assassination, he was appointed dictator in perpetuity. Under Caesar, a significant amount of authority was vested in his lieutenants, mostly because Caesar was frequently out of Italy. In October 45 BC, Caesar resigned his position as sole consul, and facilitated the election of two successors for the remainder of the year, which theoretically restored the ordinary consulship, since the constitution did not recognise a single consul without a colleague.\n\nNear the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC. This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the dictator.\n\nOn the Ides of March (15 March; see Roman calendar) of 44 BC, Caesar was due to appear at a session of the Senate. Several Senators had conspired to assassinate Caesar. Mark Antony, having vaguely learned of the plot the night before from a terrified \"liberator\" named Servilius Casca, and fearing the worst, went to head Caesar off. The plotters, however, had anticipated this and, fearing that Antony would come to Caesar's aid, had arranged for Trebonius to intercept him just as he approached the portico of the Theatre of Pompey, where the session was to be held, and detain him outside (Plutarch, however, assigns this action to delay Antony to Brutus Albinus). When he heard the commotion from the Senate chamber, Antony fled.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, as Caesar arrived at the Senate, Tillius Cimber presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother. The other conspirators crowded round to offer support. Both Plutarch and Suetonius say that Caesar waved him away, but Cimber grabbed his shoulders and pulled down Caesar's tunic. Caesar then cried to Cimber, \"Why, this is violence!\" (\"Ista quidem vis est!\").\n\nAt the same time, Casca produced his dagger and made a glancing thrust at the dictator's neck. Caesar turned around quickly and caught Casca by the arm. According to Plutarch, he said in Latin, \"Casca, you villain, what are you doing?\" Casca, frightened, shouted, \"Help, brother!\" in Greek (\", \"adelphe, boethei\"\"). Within moments, the entire group, including Brutus, was striking out at the dictator. Caesar attempted to get away, but, blinded by blood, he tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenceless on the lower steps of the portico. According to Eutropius, around 60 men participated in the assassination. He was stabbed 23 times.\n\nAccording to Suetonius, a physician later established that only one wound, the second one to his chest, had been lethal.\nThe dictator's last words are not known with certainty, and are a contested subject among scholars and historians alike. Suetonius reports that others have said Caesar's last words were the Greek phrase \"\" (transliterated as \"Kai su, teknon?\": \"You too, child?\" in English). However, Suetonius' own opinion was that Caesar said nothing.\n\nPlutarch also reports that Caesar said nothing, pulling his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators. The version best known in the English-speaking world is the Latin phrase \"Et tu, Brute?\" (\"And you, Brutus?\", commonly rendered as \"You too, Brutus?\"); best known from Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\", where it actually forms the first half of a macaronic line: \"\"Et tu, Brute?\" Then fall, Caesar.\" This version was already popular when the play was written, as it appears in Richard Edes's Latin play \"Caesar Interfectus\" of 1582 and \"The True Tragedie of Richarde Duke of Yorke & etc.\" of 1595, Shakespeare's source work for other plays.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, after the assassination, Brutus stepped forward as if to say something to his fellow senators; they, however, fled the building. Brutus and his companions then marched to the Capitol while crying out to their beloved city: \"People of Rome, we are once again free!\" They were met with silence, as the citizens of Rome had locked themselves inside their houses as soon as the rumour of what had taken place had begun to spread. Caesar's dead body lay where it fell on the Senate floor for nearly three hours before other officials arrived to remove it.\nCaesar's body was cremated, and on the site of his cremation, the Temple of Caesar was erected a few years later (at the east side of the main square of the Roman Forum). Only its altar now remains. A life-size wax statue of Caesar was later erected in the forum displaying the 23 stab wounds. A crowd who had gathered there started a fire, which badly damaged the forum and neighbouring buildings. In the ensuing chaos, Mark Antony, Octavian (later Augustus Caesar), and others fought a series of five civil wars, which would end in the formation of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe result unforeseen by the assassins was that Caesar's death precipitated the end of the Roman Republic. The Roman middle and lower classes, with whom Caesar was immensely popular and had been since before Gaul, became enraged that a small group of aristocrats had killed their champion. Antony, who had been drifting apart from Caesar, capitalised on the grief of the Roman mob and threatened to unleash them on the \"Optimates\", perhaps with the intent of taking control of Rome himself. To his surprise and chagrin, Caesar had named his grandnephew Gaius Octavius his sole heir (hence the name Octavian), bequeathing him the immensely potent Caesar name and making him one of the wealthiest citizens in the Republic.\n\nThe crowd at the funeral boiled over, throwing dry branches, furniture, and even clothing on to Caesar's funeral pyre, causing the flames to spin out of control, seriously damaging the Forum. The mob then attacked the houses of Brutus and Cassius, where they were repelled only with considerable difficulty, ultimately providing the spark for the civil war, fulfilling at least in part Antony's threat against the aristocrats. Antony did not foresee the ultimate outcome of the next series of civil wars, particularly with regard to Caesar's adopted heir. Octavian, aged only 18 when Caesar died, proved to have considerable political skills, and while Antony dealt with Decimus Brutus in the first round of the new civil wars, Octavian consolidated his tenuous position.\n\nTo combat Brutus and Cassius, who were massing an enormous army in Greece, Antony needed soldiers, the cash from Caesar's war chests, and the legitimacy that Caesar's name would provide for any action he took against them. With the passage of the \"lex Titia\" on 27 November 43 BC, the Second Triumvirate was officially formed, composed of Antony, Octavian, and Caesar's loyal cavalry commander Lepidus. It formally deified Caesar as Divus Iulius in 42 BC, and Caesar Octavian henceforth became \"Divi filius\" (\"Son of the divine\").\n\nBecause Caesar's clemency had resulted in his murder, the Second Triumvirate reinstated the practice of proscription, abandoned since Sulla. It engaged in the legally sanctioned killing of a large number of its opponents to secure funding for its 45 legions in the second civil war against Brutus and Cassius. Antony and Octavian defeated them at Philippi.\nAfterward, Mark Antony formed an alliance with Caesar's lover, Cleopatra, intending to use the fabulously wealthy Egypt as a base to dominate Rome. A third civil war broke out between Octavian on one hand and Antony and Cleopatra on the other. This final civil war, culminating in the latter's defeat at Actium in 31 BC and suicide in Egypt in 30 BC, resulted in the permanent ascendancy of Octavian, who became the first Roman emperor, under the name Caesar Augustus, a name conveying religious, rather than political, authority.\n\nJulius Caesar had been preparing to invade Parthia, the Caucasus, and Scythia, and then march back to Germania through Eastern Europe. These plans were thwarted by his assassination. His successors did attempt the conquests of Parthia and Germania, but without lasting results.\n\nJulius Caesar was the first historical Roman to be officially deified. He was posthumously granted the title \"Divus Iulius\" (the divine/deified Julius) by decree of the Roman Senate on 1 January 42 BC. The appearance of a comet during games in his honour was taken as confirmation of his divinity. Though his temple was not dedicated until after his death, he may have received divine honours during his lifetime: and shortly before his assassination, Mark Antony had been appointed as his \"flamen\" (priest). Both Octavian and Mark Antony promoted the cult of\" Divus Iulius\". After the death of Antony, Octavian, as the adoptive son of Caesar, assumed the title of \"Divi Filius\" (son of a god).\n\nBased on remarks by Plutarch, Caesar is sometimes thought to have suffered from epilepsy. Modern scholarship is sharply divided on the subject, and some scholars believe that he was plagued by malaria, particularly during the Sullan proscriptions of the 80s. Several specialists in headache medicine believe that instead of epilepsy, a more accurate diagnosis would be migraine headache. Other scholars contend his epileptic seizures were due to a parasitic infection in the brain by a tapeworm.\n\nCaesar had four documented episodes of what may have been complex partial seizures. He may additionally have had absence seizures in his youth. The earliest accounts of these seizures were made by the biographer Suetonius, who was born after Caesar died. The claim of epilepsy is countered among some medical historians by a claim of hypoglycemia, which can cause epileptoid seizures.\n\nIn 2003, psychiatrist Harbour F. Hodder published what he termed as the \"Caesar Complex\" theory, arguing that Caesar was a sufferer of temporal lobe epilepsy and the debilitating symptoms of the condition were a factor in Caesar's conscious decision to forgo personal safety in the days leading up to his assassination.\n\nA line from Shakespeare has sometimes been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear: \"Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf\". No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all, but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.\n\nFrancesco M. Galassi and Hutan Ashrafian suggest that Caesar's behavioral manifestations—headaches, vertigo, falls (possibly caused by muscle weakness due to nerve damage), sensory deficit, giddiness and insensibility—and syncopal episodes were the results of cerebrovascular episodes, not epilepsy. Pliny the Elder reports in his Natural History that Caesar's father and forefather died without apparent cause while putting on their shoes. These events can be more readily associated with cardiovascular complications from a stroke episode or lethal heart attack. Caesar possibly had a genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease.\n\nSuetonius, writing more than a century after Caesar's death, describes Caesar as \"tall of stature with a fair complexion, shapely limbs, a somewhat full face, and keen black eyes\".\n\nUsing the Latin alphabet of the period, which lacked the letters \"J\" and \"U\", Caesar's name would be rendered \"GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR\"; the form \"CAIVS\" is also attested, using the older Roman representation of \"G\" by \"C\". The standard abbreviation was \"C. IVLIVS CÆSAR\", reflecting the older spelling. (The letterform \"Æ\" is a ligature of the letters \"A\" and \"E\", and is often used in Latin inscriptions to save space.)\n\nIn Classical Latin, it was pronounced . In the days of the late Roman Republic, many historical writings were done in Greek, a language most educated Romans studied. Young wealthy Roman boys were often taught by Greek slaves and sometimes sent to Athens for advanced training, as was Caesar's principal assassin, Brutus. In Greek, during Caesar's time, his family name was written Καίσαρ (\"Kaísar\"), reflecting its contemporary pronunciation. Thus, his name is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the German \"Kaiser\".\n\nIn Vulgar Latin, the original diphthong first began to be pronounced as a simple long vowel . Then, the plosive before front vowels began, due to palatalization, to be pronounced as an affricate, hence renderings like in Italian and in German regional pronunciations of Latin, as well as the title of Tsar. With the evolution of the Romance languages, the affricate became a fricative (thus, ) in many regional pronunciations, including the French one, from which the modern English pronunciation is derived. The original is preserved in Norse mythology, where he is manifested as the legendary king Kjárr.\n\nCaesar's cognomen itself became a title; it was promulgated by the Bible, which contains the famous verse \"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's\". The title became \"Kaiser\" in German and Tsar or Czar in the Slavic languages. The last Tsar in nominal power was Simeon II of Bulgaria, whose reign ended in 1946. This means that for two thousand years after Julius Caesar's assassination, there was at least one head of state bearing his name.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuspected Children\n\n\n\n\nRoman society viewed the passive role during sexual activity, regardless of gender, to be a sign of submission or inferiority. Indeed, Suetonius says that in Caesar's Gallic triumph, his soldiers sang that, \"Caesar may have conquered the Gauls, but Nicomedes conquered Caesar.\" According to Cicero, Bibulus, Gaius Memmius, and others (mainly Caesar's enemies), he had an affair with Nicomedes IV of Bithynia early in his career. The tales were repeated, referring to Caesar as the Queen of Bithynia, by some Roman politicians as a way to humiliate him. Caesar himself denied the accusations repeatedly throughout his lifetime, and according to Cassius Dio, even under oath on one occasion. This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents. A favorite tactic used by the opposition was to accuse a popular political rival as living a Hellenistic lifestyle based on Greek and Eastern culture, where homosexuality and a lavish lifestyle were more acceptable than in Roman tradition.\n\nCatullus wrote two poems suggesting that Caesar and his engineer Mamurra were lovers, but later apologised.\n\nMark Antony charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favors. Suetonius described Antony's accusation of an affair with Octavian as political slander. Octavian eventually became the first Roman Emperor as Augustus.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Caesar was regarded as one of the best orators and prose authors in Latin—even Cicero spoke highly of Caesar's rhetoric and style. Only Caesar's war commentaries have survived. A few sentences from other works are quoted by other authors. Among his lost works are his funeral oration for his paternal aunt Julia and his \"Anticato\", a document written to defame Cato in response to Cicero's published praise. Poems by Julius Caesar are also mentioned in ancient sources.\n\n\nOther works historically have been attributed to Caesar, but their authorship is in doubt:\n\nThese narratives were written and published annually during or just after the actual campaigns, as a sort of \"dispatches from the front.\" They were important in shaping Caesar's public image and enhancing his reputation when he was away from Rome for long periods. They may have been presented as public readings. As a model of clear and direct Latin style, \"The Gallic Wars\" traditionally has been studied by first- or second-year Latin students.\n\nThe texts written by Caesar, an autobiography of the most important events of his public life, are the most complete primary source for the reconstruction of his biography. However, Caesar wrote those texts with his political career in mind, so historians must filter the exaggerations and bias contained in it. The Roman emperor Augustus began a cult of personality of Caesar, which described Augustus as Caesar's political heir. The modern historiography is influenced by the Octavian traditions, such as when Caesar's epoch is considered a turning point in the history of the Roman Empire. Still, historians try to filter the Octavian bias.\n\nMany rulers in history became interested in the historiography of Caesar. Napoleon III wrote the scholarly work \"Histoire de Jules César\", which was not finished. The second volume listed previous rulers interested in the topic. Charles VIII ordered a monk to prepare a translation of the \"Gallic Wars\" in 1480. Charles V ordered a topographic study in France, to place in Gallic Wars in context; which created forty high-quality maps of the conflict. The contemporary Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent catalogued the surviving editions of the \"Commentaries\", and translated them to Turkish language. Henry IV and Louis XIII of France translated the first two commentaries and the last two respectively; Louis XIV retranslated the first one afterwards.\n\nJulius Caesar is seen as the main example of \"Caesarism\", a form of political rule led by a charismatic strongman whose rule is based upon a cult of personality, whose rationale is the need to rule by force, establishing a violent social order, and being a regime involving prominence of the military in the government. Other people in history, such as the French Napoleon Bonaparte and the Italian Benito Mussolini, have defined themselves as Caesarists. Bonaparte did not focus only on Caesar's military career but also on his relation with the masses, a predecessor to populism. The word is also used in a pejorative manner by critics of this type of political rule.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His \"Iijoki\" series, comprising 26 novels, is one of the longest autobiographical works ever written.\nPäätalo was born in Taivalkoski, Province of Oulu, into poor circumstances. His father, a lumberjack, suffered from periodical mental disorders, and Kalle had to maintain his family from the age of 14 in his father's profession. At the same time, he dreamed about becoming a writer and read avidly, being much influenced by Jack London's \"Martin Eden\" and Mika Waltari's guidebook for aspiring writers. His war service in Winter War and Continuation War was cut short by being wounded. After the wars, he moved to Tampere where he studied at technical school, becoming a building contractor, and wrote short stories that were published in various magazines. He was married twice and had two daughters by the second marriage.\n\nPäätalo debuted as a novelist in 1958 with a novel set at a building site in Tampere. In his second novel \"Our Daily Bread\", the first book in the five-volume \"Koillismaa\" series, he turned to his native region. By this time, Päätalo was able to turn a freelance writer, and from 1962 until his death he published one book each year. In 1971 he published what was to be the first volume in the 26-volume series \"Juuret Iijoen törmässä\" ('Roots in the Bank of River Ii'), probably the longest autobiographical narrative in the world (some 17 000 pages in total). The series charts Päätalo's life from his early childhood to the publication of his first novel, at the same time offering an interesting view of Finnish history over some four decades as seen from an individual's viewpoint.\n\nThough Päätalo's first books got favourable reviews, the prevailing critical attitude to his writing soon turned negative while his popularity remained steady. Some found the slowness of his narration and its seeming sticking to trifles tedious, while his innumerable fans, mostly among his own generation, were fascinated by the very abundance of detail, a meticulous reconstruction of the past. Other strengths of Päätalo's style are his absolute sincerity to the reader - he seemed to leave nothing of his life untold, yet his writing is never merely sensational - and his skillful way with spoken Finnish, especially his native dialect. Recently, many critics have begun to see his works in a new light and they have also attracted the attention of younger readers. As a recognition for his career, Päätalo received the Pro Finlandia medal and Professor's title in 1978 and an honorary doctorate at the University of Oulu in 1994.\n\nKnown as \"the king of reprints\" because of the phenomenal success of his books, Päätalo published 39 novels, two collections of short stories and one play in his lifetime, with more short stories having been published posthumously. Four of his books have been filmed, and all five volumes of the \"Koillismaa\" series have been translated into English by Richard Impola.\n\n"}

Wine that is described as \"kosher for Passover\" must have been kept free from contact with chametz, examples being grain, bread and dough.\n\nWhen kosher wine is produced, marketed and sold commercially, it would normally have a \"hechsher\" (\"seal of approval\") of a kosher certification agency, or of an authoritative rabbi who is preferably also a \"posek\" (\"decisor\" of Jewish law), or be supervised by a \"beth din\" (\"Jewish religious court of law\").\n\nIn recent times, there has been an increased demand for kosher wines and a number of wine producing countries now produce a wide variety of sophisticated kosher wines under strict rabbinical supervision, particularly in Israel, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Chile and Australia. Two of the world's largest producers and importers of kosher wines, Kedem and Manischewitz, are both based in the Northeastern United States.\n\nThe use of wine has a long history in Judaism, dating back to biblical times. Archeological evidence shows that wine was produced throughout ancient Israel. The traditional and religious use of wine continued within the Jewish diaspora community. In the United States, kosher wines came to be associated with sweet Concord wines produced by wineries founded by Jewish immigrants to New York. \n\nBeginning in the 1980s, a trend towards producing dry, premium-quality kosher wines began with the revival of the Israeli wine industry. Today kosher wine is produced not only in Israel but throughout the world, including premium wine areas like Napa Valley and the St-Emilion region of Bordeaux.\n\nAlmost all Jewish holidays, especially the Passover Seder where all present drink four cups of wine, on Purim for the festive meal, and on the Shabbat require obligatory blessings (Kiddush) over filled cups of kosher wine that are then drunk. Grape juice is also suitable on these occasions. If no wine or grape juice is present on Shabbat, the blessing over challah suffices. At Jewish marriages, circumcisions, and at Redemption of First-born ceremonies, the obligatory blessing of \"Borei Pri HaGafen\" (\"Blessed are you O Lord, Who created the fruit of the vine\") is almost always recited over kosher wine (or grape juice).\n\nAccording to the teachings of the Midrash, the forbidden fruit that Eve ate and which she gave to Adam was the grape from which wine is derived, though others contest this and say that it was in fact a fig. The capacity of wine to cause drunkenness with its consequent loosening of inhibitions is described by the ancient rabbis in Hebrew as \"nichnas yayin, yatza sod\" (\"wine enters, [and one's personal] secret[s] exit\"), similar to the Latin \"in vino veritas\". Another similarly evocative expression relating to wine is: \"Ein Simcha Ela BeBasar Veyayin\"—\"There is no joy except through [eating] meat and [drinking] wine\".)\n\nBecause of wine's special role in many non-Jewish religions, the \"kashrut\" laws specify that wine cannot be considered kosher if it might have been used for idolatry. These laws include \"Yayin Nesekh\" (), wine that has been poured to an idol, and \"Stam Yainom\", wine that has been touched by someone who believes in idolatry or produced by non-Jews. When kosher wine is \"yayin mevushal\" ( – \"cooked\" or \"boiled\"), it becomes unfit for idolatrous use and will keep the status of \"kosher\" wine even if subsequently touched by an idolater. \n\nWhile none of the ingredients that make up wine (alcohol, sugars, acidity and phenols) is considered non-kosher, the \"kashrut\" laws involving wine are concerned more with who handles the wine and what they use to make it. For wine to be considered kosher, only Sabbath-observant Jews may handle it, from the first time in the process when a liquid portion is separated from solid waste, until the wine is pasteurized or bottles are sealed. \n\nWine that is described as \"kosher for Passover\" must have been kept free from contact with chametz and kitnios. This would include grain, bread, and dough as well as legumes and corn derivatives.\n\nAs mentioned above, when kosher wine is \"mevushal\" (\"cooked\" or \"boiled\"), it thereby becomes unfit for idolatrous use and will keep the status of kosher wine even if subsequently touched by an idolater. It is not known whence the ancient Jewish authorities derived this claim; there are no records concerning \"boiled wine\" and its fitness for use in the cults of any of the religions of the peoples surrounding ancient Israel. Indeed, in Orthodox Christianity, it is common to add boiling water to the sacramental wine. Another opinion holds that mevushal wine was not included in the rabbinic edict against drinking wine touched by an idolater simply because such wine was uncommon in those times.\n\nMevushal wine is frequently used in kosher restaurants and by kosher caterers so as to allow the wine to be handled by non-Jewish or non-observant waiters. \n\nThe process of fully boiling a wine kills off most of the fine mold on the grapes, and greatly alters the tannins and flavors of the wine. Therefore, great care is taken to satisfy the legal requirements while exposing the wine to as little heat as necessary. There is significant disagreement between halachic deciders as to the precise temperature a wine must reach to be considered mevushal, ranging from 165°F (74°C) to 194°F (90°C). (At this temperature, the wine is not at a rolling boil, but it is cooking, in the sense that it will evaporate much more quickly than usual.) Cooking at the minimum required temperature reduces some of the damage done to the wine, but still has a substantial effect on quality and aging potential.\n\nRecently, a process called flash pasteurization has come into vogue. This method rapidly heats the wine to the desired temperature and immediately chills it back to room temperature. This process is said to have a minimal effect on flavor, at least to the casual wine drinker. \n\nIrrespective of the method, the pasteurization process must be overseen by \"mashgichim\" to ensure the kosher status of the wine. Generally, they will attend the winery to physically tip the fruit into the crush, and operate the pasteurization equipment. Once the wine emerges from the process, it can be handled and aged in the normal fashion.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards approved a \"responsum\" (\"legal ruling\") by Rabbi Israel Silverman on this subject. Silverman noted that some classical Jewish authorities believed that Christians are not considered idolaters, and that their products cannot be considered forbidden in this regard. He also noted that most winemaking in the United States is fully automated. Based on 15th–19th century precedents in the \"responsa\" literature, he concluded that wines manufactured by this automated process may not be classified as wine \"manufactured by gentiles\", and thus are not prohibited by Jewish law. This \"responsum\" makes no attempt to change \"halakhah\" in any way, but rather argues that most American wine, made in an automated fashion, is already kosher by traditional halakhic standards. Some criticism was later made against this \"teshuvah\", because (a) some wines are not made by automated processes but rather, at least in some steps, by hand, and (b) on rare occasions non-kosher fining ingredients are used in wine preparation. Silverman later retracted his position.\n\nA later \"responsum\" on this subject was written by Rabbi Elliot N. Dorff, and also accepted by the CJLS. Dorff noted that not all wines are made by automated processes, and thus the reasoning behind Silverman's responsum was not conclusively reliable in all cases. On the other hand, Dorff points out that even if we can avoid the issue of \"wine handled by a gentile\", there is a separate prohibition against wine produced from wineries owned by a gentile, in which case automation is irrelevant, and all non-certified wines are prohibited. Therefore, he explored the possibility to change the halacha, arguing that the prohibition no longer applies. He cites rabbinic thought on Jewish views of Christians, also finding that most \"poskim\" refused to consign Christians to the status of idolater. Dorff then critiqued the traditional halakhic argument that avoiding such wine would prevent intermarriage. Dorff asserted, however, that those who were strict about the laws of \"kashrut\" were not likely to intermarry, and those that did not follow the laws would not care if a wine has a \"heksher\" or not. He also noted that a number of non-kosher ingredients may be used in the manufacturing process, including animal blood.\n\nDorff concluded a number of points including that there is no reason to believe that the production of such wines is conducted as part of pagan (or indeed, \"any\") religious practice. Most wines have absolutely no non-kosher ingredients whatsoever. Some wines use a non-kosher ingredient as part of a fining process, but not as an ingredient in the wine as such. Dorff noted that material from this matter is not intended to infiltrate the wine product. The inclusion of any non-kosher ingredient within the wine occurs by accident, and in such minute quantities that the ingredient is nullified. All wines made in the USA and Canada may be considered kosher, regardless of whether or not their production is subject to rabbinical supervision. Many foods once considered forbidden if produced by non-Jews (such as wheat and oil products) were eventually declared kosher. Based on the above points, Dorff's responsum extends this same ruling to wine and other grape-products.\n\nHowever, this teshuvah also notes that this is a lenient view. Some Conservative rabbis disagree with it, e.g. Isaac Klein. As such Dorff's teshuvah states that synagogues should hold themselves to a stricter standard so that all in the Jewish community will view the synagogue's kitchen as fully kosher. As such, Conservative synagogues are encouraged to use only wines with a heksher, and preferably wines from Israel.\n\nThe United States of America contains roughly 40% of the Jewish population of the world, and most US wine stores, particularly in the northeast, have a small kosher section.\n\nHistorically, kosher wine has been associated in the US with the Manischewitz brand, which produce a sweetened wine with a distinctive taste, made of labrusca rather than vinifera grapes. Due to the addition of high-fructose corn syrup, the normal bottlings of Manischewitz are, for Ashkenazi Jews, not kosher during Passover by the rule of \"kitniyot\", and a special bottling is made available. This cultural preference for a distinct, unique variety of wine dates back to Jewish settlements in early US history.\n\nToday, there are thousands of kosher wines available in every conceivable style from virtually all of the world's wine-producing regions.\n\n"}

While the \"O\"s are usually in lower-case to indicate that they do not stand for anything, the all-capitals \"MOSCOW\" is also used.\n\nThis prioritisation method was developed by Dai Clegg and first used extensively with the agile project delivery framework Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM).\n\nMoSCoW is often used with timeboxing, where a deadline is fixed so that the focus must be on the most important requirements, and as such is a technique commonly used in agile software development approaches such as Scrum, rapid application development (RAD), and DSDM.\n\nAll requirements are important, but they are prioritized to deliver the greatest and most immediate business benefits early. Developers will initially try to deliver all the \"Must have\", \"Should have\" and \"Could have\" requirements but the \"Should\" and \"Could\" requirements will be the first to be removed if the delivery timescale looks threatened.\n\nThe plain English meaning of the prioritization categories has value in getting customers to better understand the impact of setting a priority, compared to alternatives like \"High\", \"Medium\" and \"Low\".\n\nThe categories are typically understood as:\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes W is used to mean Wish (or Would), i.e. still possible but unlikely to be included (and less likely than Could). This is then distinguished from X for Excluded for items which are explicitly not included.\n\nIn new product development, particularly those following agile software development approaches, there is always more to do than there is time or funding to permit (hence the need for prioritization). \n\nFor example, should a team have too many potential epics (i.e., high-level stories) for the next release of their product, they could use the \"MoSCoW method\" to select which epics are \"Must have\", which \"Should have\", and so on; the minimum viable product (or MVP) would be all those epics marked as \"Must have\". Oftentimes, a team will find that, even after identifying their MVP, they have too much work for their expected capacity. In such cases, the team could then use the \"MoSCoW method\" to select which features (or stories, if that is the subset of epics in their organisation) are \"Must have\", \"Should have\", and so on; the minimum marketable features (or MMF) would be all those marked as \"Must have\". If there is sufficient capacity after selecting the MVP or MMF, the team could then plan to include \"Should have\" and even \"Could have\" items too. \n\nCriticism of the MoSCoW method includes: \n\n"}

Examples include \"A Stanley Kubrick film\" (\"The Shining\"), \"A film by Quentin Tarantino\" (\"Pulp Fiction\"), and \"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho\" (\"Psycho\"). Possessory credit is also sometimes used in television programs; for example, \"Tyler Perry's House of Payne\" (Tyler Perry's TBS sitcom \"House of Payne\"). Occasionally another word besides \"film\" is used, such as \"A Spike Lee Joint\" or \"A Martin Scorsese Picture\". Possessory credit may also be given to the producer; an example of this is \"Steven Spielberg presents \"Back to the Future\"\".\n\nAlthough the earliest use of possessory credit dates from 1915's \"The Birth of a Nation\", the use of possessory credits expanded particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. The Writers Guild of America has repeatedly tried to limit possessory credits to writers but has always been successfully opposed by the Directors Guild of America (DGA), leaving directors free to try to negotiate such credits if they wish.\n\nSometimes the possessory credit goes to the author of the novel on which the film was based (such as \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" or \"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet\"). In the case of \"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas\", Burton was not the film's director but instead the writer, producer, and a major creative voice. This may also be an example of a possessory credit being chosen for marketing reasons, as Burton was a more recognized name than the film's director, Henry Selick.\n\nThe DGA encourages filmmakers to use restraint in taking credit until they have attained widespread name recognition or received at least two established awards of merit for their films, thereby securing their legacies as filmmakers.\n\nPossessory credits are sometimes used for video games such as \"American McGee's Alice\", \"Sid Meier's Civilization\", games released by Tom Clancy's Red Storm Entertainment, and games in the \"Metal Gear\" series.\n\nThey are also used when celebrities have licensed their names for use in games, or are involved with the game's development—for example, \"Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!\", and skater Tony Hawk's various games.\n\n"}

{"id": "77740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77740", "title": "Salic law", "text": "Salic law\n\nThe Salic law ( or ; ), or the was the ancient Salian Frankish civil law code compiled around AD 500 by the first Frankish King, Clovis. The written text is in Latin, or in \"semi-French Latin\" according to some linguists, it also contains what Dutch linguists describe as one of the earliest known records of Old Dutch, perhaps second only to the Bergakker inscription. It remained the basis of Frankish law throughout the early Medieval period, and influenced future European legal systems. The best-known tenet of the old law is the principle of exclusion of women from inheritance of thrones, fiefs and other property. The Salic laws were arbitrated by a committee appointed and empowered by the King of the Franks. Dozens of manuscripts dating from the 6th to 8th centuries and three emendations as late as the 9th century have survived.\n\nSalic law provided written codification of both civil law, such as the statutes governing inheritance, and criminal law, such as the punishment for murder. Although it was originally intended as the law of the Salians or Western Franks, it has had a formative influence on the tradition of statute law that extended to modern history in Western and Central Europe, especially in the German states, the Netherlands, parts of Italy and Spain, Austria-Hungary, Romania, and the Balkans.\n\nThe original edition of the code was commissioned by the first king of all the Franks, Clovis I (c. 466–511), and published sometime between 507 and 511. He appointed four commissioners to research uses of laws that, until the publication of the Salic Law, had been recorded only in the minds of designated elders, who would meet in council when their knowledge was required. Transmission was entirely oral. Salic Law therefore reflects ancient usages and practices. In order to govern more effectively, it was desirable for monarchs and their administrations to have a written code. The name of the code comes from the circumstance that Clovis was a Merovingian king ruling only the Salian Franks before his unification of Francia. The law must have applied to the Ripuarian Franks as well; however, containing only 65 titles, it may not have included any special Ripuarian laws.\n\nFor the next 300 years the code was copied by hand, and was amended as required to add newly enacted laws, revise laws that had been amended, and delete laws that had been repealed. In contrast with printing, hand copying is an individual act by an individual copyist with ideas and a style of his own. Each of the several dozen surviving manuscripts features a unique set of errors, corrections, content and organization. The laws are called \"titles\" as each one has its own name, generally preceded by \"de\", \"of\", \"concerning\". Different sections of titles acquired individual names which revealed something about their provenances. Some of these dozens of names have been adopted for specific reference, often given the same designation as the overall work, \"lex\".\n\nThe recension of Hendrik Kern organizes all of the manuscripts into five families according to similarity and relative chronological sequence, judged by content and dateable material in the text. Family I is the oldest, containing four manuscripts dated to the 8th and 9th centuries but containing 65 titles believed to be copies of originals published in the 6th century. In addition they feature the \"Malbergse Glossen\", \"Malberg Glosses\", marginal glosses stating the native court word for some Latin words. These are named from native \"malbergo\", \"language of the court\". Kern's Family II, represented by two manuscripts, is the same as Family I, except that it contains \"interpolations or numerous additions which point to a later period\".\n\nFamily III is split into two divisions. The first, comprising three manuscripts, dated to the 8th–9th centuries, presents an expanded text of 99 or 100 titles. The Malberg Glosses are retained. The second division, with four manuscripts, not only drops the glosses, but \"bears traces of attempts to make the language more concise\". A statement gives the provenance: \"in the 13th year of the reign of our most glorious king of the Franks, Pipin\". Some of the internal documents were composed after the reign of Pepin the Short, but it is considered to be an emendation initiated by Pepin, and is therefore termed the \"Pipina Recensio\".\n\nFamily IV also has two divisions: the first comprised 33 manuscripts; the second, one manuscript. They are characterized by the internal assignment of Latin names to various sections of different provenance. Two of the sections are dated to 768 and 778, but the emendation is believed to be dated to 798, late in the reign of Charlemagne. This edition calls itself the \"Lex Salica Emendata\", or the \"Lex Reformata\", or the \"Lex Emendata\", and is clearly the result of a law code reform by Charlemagne.\n\nBy that time his Holy Roman Empire comprised most of Western Europe. He adds laws of choice taken from the earlier law codes of Germanic peoples not originally part of Francia. These are numbered into the laws that were there, but they have their own, quasi-sectional, title. All the Franks of Francia were subject to the same law code, which retained the overall title of \"Lex Salica\". These integrated sections borrowed from other Germanic codes are the \"Lex Ribuariorum\", later \"Lex Ribuaria\", laws adopted from the Ripuarian Franks, who, before Clovis, had been independent. The \"Lex Alamannorum\" took laws from the Alamanni, then subject to the Franks. Under the Franks, they were governed by Frankish law, not their own. The inclusion of some of their law as part of the Salic Law must have served as a palliative. Charlemagne goes back even earlier to the \"Lex Suauorum\", the ancient code of the Suebi preceding the Alemanni.\n\nGlosses to the Salic law code (the \"Malbergse glossen\") contain several Old Dutch words and what is likely the earliest full sentence in the language:\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Old Dutch and Early Modern and earlier versions of English used the second-person singular pronoun, like \"thou\" and \"thee\".\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> A \"lito\" was a form of serf in the feudal system, a half-free farmer, connected to the lord's land but not owned by that lord. In contrast, a slave was fully owned by the lord.\n\nThese laws and their interpretations give an insight into Frankish society. The criminal laws established damages to be paid and fines levied in recompense for injuries to persons and damage to goods (e.g. slaves), theft, and unprovoked insults. One-third of the fine paid court costs. Judicial interpretation was by a jury of peers.\n\nThe civil law establishes that an individual person is legally unprotected if he or she does not belong to a family. The rights of family members were defined: for example, the equal division of land among all living male heirs, in contrast to primogeniture.\n\nOne tenet of the civil law is agnatic succession, explicitly excluding females from the inheritance of a throne or fief. Indeed, \"Salic law\" has often been used simply as a synonym for agnatic succession. But the importance of Salic law extends beyond the rules of inheritance, as it is a direct ancestor of the systems of law in use in many parts of continental Europe today.\n\nSalic law regulates succession according to sex. \"Agnatic succession\" means succession to the throne or fief going to an agnate of the predecessor: for example, a brother, a son, or nearest male relative through the male line, including collateral agnate branches, for example very distant cousins. Chief forms are \"agnatic seniority\" and \"agnatic primogeniture\". The latter, which has been the most usual, means succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.\n\nConcerning the inheritance of land, Salic Law said:\n\nor, another transcript:\n\nAs interpreted by the Salian Franks, the law merely prohibited women from inheriting ancestral \"Salic land\"; this prohibition did not apply to other property (such as personal property); and under Chilperic I sometime around the year 570, the law was actually amended to permit inheritance of land by a daughter if a man had no surviving sons. (This amendment, depending on how it is applied and interpreted, offers the basis for either Semi-Salic succession or male-preferred primogeniture, or both.)\n\nThe wording of the law, as well as common usage in those days and centuries afterwards, seems to support an interpretation that inheritance is divided between brothers. And, if it is intended to govern succession, it can be interpreted to mandate agnatic seniority, not direct primogeniture.\n\nIn its use by Continental hereditary monarchies since the 15th century, aiming at agnatic succession, the Salic law is regarded as excluding all females from the succession as well as prohibiting the transfer of succession rights through any woman. At least two systems of hereditary succession are direct and full applications of the Salic Law: agnatic seniority and agnatic primogeniture.\n\nThe so-called \"Semi-Salic\" version of succession order stipulates that firstly all-male descendance is applied, including all collateral male lines; but if all such lines are extinct, then the closest female agnate (such as a daughter) of the last male holder of the property inherits, and after her, her own male heirs according to the Salic order. In other words, the female closest to the last incumbent is \"regarded as a male\" for the purposes of inheritance and succession. This has the effect of following the closest extant blood line (at least in the first instance) and not involving any more distant relatives (see, for example: Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 in Austria). The closest female relative might be a child of a relatively junior branch of the whole dynasty, but still inherits due to her position in the male line, thanks to the longevity of her own branch; any existing senior female lines come behind that of the closest female.\n\nFrom the Middle Ages, there was another system of succession, known as cognatic male primogeniture, which actually fulfills apparent stipulations of the original Salic law: succession is allowed also through female lines, but excludes the females themselves in favour of their sons. For example, a grandfather, without sons, is succeeded by a son of his daughter, when the daughter in question is still alive. Or an uncle, with no children of his own, is succeeded by a son of his sister, when the sister in question is still alive.\n\nStrictly seen, this fulfils the Salic condition of \"no land comes to a woman, but the land comes to the male sex\". This can be called a \"Quasi-Salic\" system of succession and it should be classified as primogenitural, cognatic, and male.\n\nThe Merovingian kings divided their realm equally among all living sons, leading to much conflict and fratricide among the rival heirs. The Carolingians did likewise, but they also possessed the imperial dignity, which was indivisible and passed to only one person at a time. Primogeniture, or the preference for the eldest line in the transmission of inheritance, eventually emerged in France, under the Capetian kings. The early Capetians had only one heir, the eldest son, whom they crowned during their lifetime. Instead of an equal portion of the inheritance, the younger sons of the Capetian kings received an appanage, which is a feudal territory under the suzerainty of the king. Feudal law allowed the transmission of fiefs to daughters in default of sons, which was also the case for the early appanages. Whether feudal law also applied to the French throne no one knew, until 1316.\n\nFor a remarkably long period, from the inception of the Capetian dynasty in 987 until the death of Louis X in 1316, the eldest living son of the King of France succeeded to the throne upon his demise. There was no prior occasion to demonstrate whether or not females were excluded from the succession to the crown. Louis X died without a son, but left his wife pregnant. The king's brother, Philip, Count of Poitiers, became regent. Philip prepared for the contingencies with Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy, maternal uncle of Louis X's daughter and prospective heiress, Joan. If the unborn child was male, he would succeed to the French throne as king; if female, Philip would maintain the regency until the daughters of Louis X reach their majority. There was opportunity for either daughter to succeed to the French throne.\n\nThe unborn child proved to be male, John I, to the relief of the kingdom. But the infant lived for only a few days. Philip saw his chance and broke the agreement with the Duke of Burgundy by having himself anointed at Reims in January 1317 as Philip V of France. Agnes of France, daughter of Saint Louis, mother of the Duke of Burgundy, and maternal grandmother of the Princess Joan, considered it an usurpation and demanded an assembly of the peers, which Philip V accepted.\n\nAn assembly of prelates, lords, the bourgeois of Paris and doctors of the University, known as the Estates-General of 1317, gathered in February. Philip V asked them to write an argument justifying his right to the throne of France. These \"general statements\" agreed in declaring that \"Women do not succeed the kingdom of France\", formalizing Philip's usurpation and the impossibility for a woman to ascend the throne of France, a principle in force until the end of the monarchy. The Salic law, at the time, was not yet invoked: the arguments put forward in favor of Philip V relied only on the degree of proximity of Philip V with St. Louis. Philip had the support of the nobility and had the resources for his ambitions.\n\nPhilip won over the Duke of Burgundy by giving him his daughter, also named Joan, in marriage, with the counties of Artois and Burgundy as her eventual inheritance. On March 27, 1317, a treaty was signed at Laon between the Duke of Burgundy and Philip V, wherein Joan renounced her right to the throne of France.\n\nPhilip, too, died without a son, and his brother Charles succeeded him as Charles IV unopposed. Charles, too, died without a son, but also left his wife pregnant. It was another succession crisis, the same as that in 1316: it was necessary both to prepare for a possible regency (and choose a regent) and prepare for a possible succession to the throne. At this point, it had been accepted that women could not claim the crown of France (without any written rule stipulating it yet).\n\nUnder the application of the agnatic principle, the following were excluded:\n\nThe widow of Charles IV gave birth to a daughter. Isabella of France, sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, Edward III of England. The French rejected the claim, noting that \"Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess\", a corollary to the succession principle in 1316. The regent, Philip of Valois, became Philip VI of France in 1328. Philip became king without serious opposition, until his attempt to confiscate Gascony in 1337 made Edward III press his claim to the French throne.\n\nAs far as can be ascertained, \"Salic law\" was not explicitly mentioned either in 1316 or 1328. It had been forgotten in the feudal era, and the assertion that the French crown can only be transmitted to and through males made it unique and exalted in the eyes of the French. Jurists later resurrected the long-defunct Salic law and reinterpreted it to justify the line of succession arrived at in the cases of 1316 and 1328 by forbidding not only inheritance by a woman but also inheritance through a female line (\"In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant\").\n\nIn its origin, therefore, the agnatic principle was limited to the succession to the crown of France. Prior to the Valois succession, Capetian kings granted appanages to their younger sons and brothers, which could pass to male and female heirs. But the appanages given to the Valois princes, in imitation of the succession law of the monarchy that gave them, limited their transmission to males. Another Capetian lineage, the Montfort of Brittany, claimed male succession in the Duchy of Brittany. In this they were supported by the King of England, while their rivals who claimed the traditional female succession in Brittany were supported by the King of France. The Montforts eventually won the duchy by warfare, but had to recognize the suzerainty of the King of France.\n\nThis law was by no means intended to cover all matters of inheritance — for example, not the inheritance of movables – only those lands considered \"Salic\" — and there is still debate as to the legal definition of this word, although it is generally accepted to refer to lands in the royal fisc. Only several hundred years later, under the Direct Capetian kings of France and their English contemporaries who held lands in France, did Salic law become a rationale for enforcing or debating succession. By then it was somewhat anachronistic — there were no Salic lands, since the Salian monarchy and its lands had originally emerged in what is now the Netherlands.\n\nShakespeare claims that Charles VI rejected Henry V's claim to the French throne on the basis of Salic law's inheritance rules, leading to the Battle of Agincourt. In fact, the conflict between Salic law and English law was a justification for many overlapping claims between the French and English monarchs over the French Throne.\n\nMore than a century later, Philip II of Spain attempted to claim the French crown for his daughter Isabella Clara Eugenia, born of his Valois queen. Philip's agents were instructed to \"insinuate cleverly\" that the Salic law was a \"pure invention\". But even if the \"Salic law\" did not really apply to the throne of France, the very principle of agnatic succession had become a cornerstone of the French royal succession; they had upheld it in the Hundred Years' War with the English, and it had produced their kings for more than two centuries. The eventual recognition of Henry IV, the first of the Bourbons kings, further solidified the agnatic principle in France.\n\nA number of military conflicts in European history have stemmed from the application of, or disregard for, Salic law. The Carlist Wars occurred in Spain over the question of whether the heir to the throne should be a female or a male relative. The War of the Austrian Succession was triggered by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 in which Charles VI of Austria, who himself had inherited the Austrian patrimony over his nieces as a result of Salic law, attempted to ensure the inheritance directly to his own daughter Maria Theresa of Austria, that being an example of an operation of the \"Semi-Salic law\".\n\nIn the modern Kingdom of Italy, under the House of Savoy, succession to the throne was regulated by Salic law.\n\nThe British and the Hanoverian thrones separated after the death of King William IV of the United Kingdom and of Hanover, in 1837. Hanover practised Semi-Salic law, but not Britain. King William's niece, Victoria, ascended to the throne of Great Britain and Ireland, but the throne of Hanover went to William's brother Ernest, Duke of Cumberland.\n\nSalic law was also an important issue in the Schleswig-Holstein Question and played a weary prosaic day-to-day role in the inheritance and marriage decisions of common princedoms of the German states, such as Saxe-Weimar, to cite a representative example. It is not much of an overstatement to say that European nobility confronted Salic issues at every turn and nuance of diplomacy, and certainly, especially when negotiating marriages, for the entire male line had to be extinguished for a land title to pass (by marriage) \"to a female's husband\"—women rulers were anathema in the German states well into the modern era.\n\nIn a similar way, the thrones of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg were separated in 1890, with the succession of Princess Wilhelmina as the first Queen regnant of the Netherlands. As a remnant of Salic law, the office of the reigning monarch of the Netherlands is always formally known as 'King' even though her title may be 'Queen'. Luxembourg passed to the House of Orange-Nassau's distantly-related agnates, the House of Nassau-Weilburg. However, that house too faced extinction in the male line less than two decades later. With no other male-line agnates in the remaining branches of the House of Nassau, Grand Duke William IV adopted a semi-salic law of succession so that he could be succeeded by his daughters.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "29473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29473", "title": "Salvation", "text": "Salvation\n\nSalvation (; ; ; ) is being saved or protected from harm or being saved or delivered from a dire situation. In religion, salvation is saving of the soul from sin and its consequences.\n\nThe academic study of salvation is called soteriology.\n\nIn religion, salvation is the saving of the soul from sin and its consequences. It may also be called \"deliverance\" or \"redemption\" from sin and its effects. Historically, salvation is considered to be caused either by the grace of a deity (i.e. unmerited and unearned); by the independent choices of a free will and personal effort (i.e. earned and/or merited); or by some combination of the two. Religions often emphasize the necessity of both personal effort—for example, repentance and asceticism—and divine action (e.g. grace).\n\nIn contemporary Judaism, redemption (Hebrew \"ge'ulah\"), refers to God redeeming the people of Israel from their various exiles. This includes the final redemption from the present exile.\n\nJudaism holds that adherents do not need personal salvation as Christians believe. Jews do not subscribe to the doctrine of original sin. Instead, they place a high value on individual morality as defined in the law of God — embodied in what Jews know as the Torah or The Law, given to Moses by God on biblical Mount Sinai.\n\nIn Judaism, salvation is closely related to the idea of redemption, a saving from the states or circumstances that destroy the value of human existence. God, as the universal spirit and Creator of the World, is the source of all salvation for humanity, provided an individual honours God by observing his precepts. So redemption or salvation depends on the individual. Judaism stresses that salvation cannot be obtained through anyone else or by just invoking a deity or believing in any outside power or influence.\n\nWhen examining Jewish intellectual sources throughout history, there is clearly a spectrum of opinions regarding death versus the afterlife. Possibly an over-simplification, one source says salvation can be achieved in the following manner: Live a holy and righteous life dedicated to Yahweh, the God of Creation. Fast, worship, and celebrate during the appropriate holidays.\nBy origin and nature, Judaism is an ethnic religion. Therefore, salvation has been primarily conceived in terms of the destiny of Israel as the elect people of Yahweh (often referred to as “the Lord”), the God of Israel. In the biblical text of Psalms, there is a description of death, when people go into the earth or the \"realm of the dead\" and cannot praise God. The first reference to resurrection is collective in Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones, when all the Israelites in exile will be resurrected. There is a reference to individual resurrection in the Book of Daniel (165 BCE), the last book of the Hebrew Bible. It was not until the 2nd century BCE that there arose a belief in an afterlife, in which the dead would be resurrected and undergo divine judgment. Before that time, the individual had to be content that his posterity continued within the holy nation.\n\nThe salvation of the individual Jew was connected to the salvation of the entire people. This belief stemmed directly from the teachings of the Torah. In the Torah, God taught his people sanctification of the individual. However, he also expected them to function together (spiritually) and be accountable to one another. The concept of salvation was tied to that of restoration for Israel.\n\nChristianity’s primary premise is that the incarnation and death of Jesus Christ formed the climax of a divine plan for humanity’s salvation. This plan was conceived by God consequent on the Fall of Adam, the progenitor of the human race, and it would be completed at the Last Judgment, when the Second Coming of Christ would mark the catastrophic end of the world.\n\nFor Christianity, salvation is only possible through Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Jesus' death on the cross was the once-for-all sacrifice that atoned for the sin of humanity.\n\nThe Christian religion, though not the exclusive possessor of the idea of redemption, has given to it a special definiteness and a dominant position. Taken in its widest sense, as deliverance from dangers and ills in general, most religions teach some form of it. It assumes an important position, however, only when the ills in question form part of a great system against which human power is helpless.\nAccording to Christian belief, sin as the human predicament is considered to be universal. For example, in the Apostle Paul declared everyone to be under sin—Jew and Gentile alike. Salvation is made possible by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, which in the context of salvation is referred to as the \"atonement\". Christian soteriology ranges from exclusive salvation to universal reconciliation concepts. While some of the differences are as widespread as Christianity itself, the overwhelming majority agrees that salvation is made possible by the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, dying on the cross.\n\nVariant views on salvation are among the main fault lines dividing the various Christian denominations, both between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism and within Protestantism, notably in the Calvinist–Arminian debate, and the fault lines include conflicting definitions of depravity, predestination, atonement, but most pointedly justification.\n\nSalvation is believed to be a process that begins when a person first becomes a Christian, continues through that person's life, and is completed when they stand before Christ in judgment. Therefore, according to Catholic apologist James Akin, the faithful Christian can say in faith and hope, \"I \"have been\" saved; I \"am being\" saved; and I \"will be\" saved.\"\n\nChristian salvation concepts are varied and complicated by certain theological concepts, traditional beliefs, and dogmas. Scripture is subject to individual and ecclesiastical interpretations. While some of the differences are as widespread as Christianity itself, the overwhelming majority agrees that salvation is made possible by the work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, dying on the cross.\n\nThe purpose of salvation is debated, but in general most Christian theologians agree that God devised and implemented his plan of salvation because he loves them and regards human beings as his children. Since human existence on Earth is said to be \"given to sin\", salvation also has connotations that deal with the liberation of human beings from sin, and the suffering associated with the punishment of sin—i.e., \"the wages of sin are death.\"\n\nChristians believe that salvation depends on the grace of God. Stagg writes that a fact assumed throughout the Bible is that humanity is in, \"serious trouble from which we need deliverance…. The fact of sin as the human predicament is implied in the mission of Jesus, and it is explicitly affirmed in that connection\". By its nature, salvation must answer to the plight of humankind as it actually is. Each individual's plight as sinner is the result of a fatal choice involving the whole person in bondage, guilt, estrangement, and death. Therefore, salvation must be concerned with the total person. \"It must offer redemption from bondage, forgiveness for guilt, reconciliation for estrangement, renewal for the marred image of God\".\n\nAccording to doctrine of the Latter Day Saint movement, the plan of salvation is a plan that God created to save, redeem, and exalt humankind. The elements of this plan are drawn from various sources, including the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and numerous statements made by the leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The first appearance of the graphical representation of the plan of salvation is in the 1952 missionary manual entitled \"A Systematic Program for Teaching the Gospel.\"\n\nIn Islam, salvation refers to the eventual entrance to heaven. Islam teaches that people who die disbelieving in God do not receive salvation. It also teaches that non-Muslims who die believing in the God but disbelieving in his message (Islam), are left to his will. Those who die believing in the One God and his message (Islam) receive salvation.\n\nNarrated Anas that Muhammad said,\nIslam teaches that all who enter into Islam must remain so in order to receive salvation.\nFor those who have not been granted Islam or to whom the message has not been brought;\nBelief in the “One God”, also known as the \"Tawhid\" (التَوْحيدْ) in Arabic, consists of two parts (or principles):\n\nIslam also stresses that in order to gain salvation, one must also avoid sinning along with performing good deeds. Islam acknowledges the inclination of humanity towards sin. Therefore, Muslims are constantly commanded to seek God's forgiveness and repent. Islam teaches that no one can gain salvation simply by virtue of their belief or deeds, instead it is the Mercy of God, which merits them salvation. However, this repentance must not be used to sin any further. Islam teaches that God is Merciful.\n\nIslam describes a true believer to have Love of God and Fear of God. Islam also teaches that every person is responsible for their own sins. The Quran states;\n\nAl-Agharr al-Muzani, a companion of Mohammad, reported that Ibn 'Umar stated to him that Mohammad said,\n\nSin in Islam is not a state, but an action (a bad deed); Islam teaches that a child is born sinless, regardless of the belief of his parents, dies a Muslim; he enters heaven, and does not enter hell. \n\nThere are acts of worship that Islam teaches to be mandatory. Islam is built on five principles. Narrated Ibn 'Umar that Muhammad said,\nNot performing the mandatory acts of worship may deprive Muslims of the chance of salvation.\n\nHinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism share certain key concepts, which are interpreted differently by different groups and individuals. In these religions one is not liberated from sin and its consequences, but from the \"saṃsāra\" (cycle of rebirth) perpetuated by passions and delusions and its resulting karma. They differ however on the exact nature of this liberation. Salvation is called \"moksha\" or \"mukti\" which mean liberation and release respectively. This state and the conditions considered necessary for its realization is described in early texts of Indian religion such as the Upanishads and the Pāli Canon, and later texts such the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and the Vedanta tradition. \"Moksha\" can be attained by sādhanā, literally \"means of accomplishing something\". It includes a variety of disciplines, such as yoga and meditation.\n\nNirvana is the profound peace of mind that is acquired with moksha (liberation). In Buddhism and Jainism, it is the state of being free from suffering. In Hindu philosophy, it is union with the Brahman (Supreme Being). The word literally means \"blown out\" (as in a candle) and refers, in the Buddhist context, to the blowing out of the fires of desire, aversion, and delusion, and the imperturbable stillness of mind acquired thereafter.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism the emphasis is on one's own liberation from samsara. The Mahayana traditions emphasize the bodhisattva path, in which \"each Buddha and Bodhisattva is a redeemer\", assisting the Buddhist in seeking to achieve the redemptive state. The assistance rendered is a form of self-sacrifice on the part of the teachers, who would presumably be able to achieve total detachment from worldly concerns, but have instead chosen to remain engaged in the material world to the degree that this is necessary to assist others in achieving such detachment.\n\nIn Jainism, \"salvation\", \"moksa\" and \"nirvana\" are one and the same. When a soul (\"atman\") achieves moksa, it is released from the cycle of births and deaths, and achieves its pure self. It then becomes a \"siddha\" (literally means one who has accomplished his ultimate objective). Attaining Moksa requires annihilation of all \"karmas\", good and bad, because if karma is left, it must bear fruit.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20371458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20371458", "title": "Vakkom Moulavi", "text": "Vakkom Moulavi\n\nVakkom Mohammed Abdul Khader Moulavi ( - ) , popularly known as \"Vakkom Moulavi\" was a social reformer, teacher, prolific writer, Muslim scholar, journalist, freedom fighter and newspaper proprietor in Travancore, a princely state of the present day Kerala, India. He was the founder and publisher of the newspaper \"Swadeshabhimani\" which was banned and confiscated by the Government of Travancore in 1910 due to its criticisms against the government and the Diwan of Travancore, P.Rajagopalachari.\n\nMoulavi was born in 1873 in Vakkom, Chirayinkil Taluk, Thiruvananthapuram in Travancore. He was born into a prominent Muslim family Poonthran which had ancestral roots to Madurai and Hyderabad, and many of his maternal ancestors worked for the military of the state government.\n\nHis father, a prominent merchant, engaged a number of scholars from distant places, including an itinerant Arab savant, to teach him every subject he wished to learn. Moulavi made such rapid progress, that some of his teachers soon found that their stock of knowledge was exhausted and at least one of them admitted that had learnt from his student more than he could teach him. In a short time, Moulavi had learnt many languages including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Tamil, Sanskrit and English.\n\nIn early 1900s, Moulavi was married to Haleema, daughter of Aliyar Kunju Poonthran Vilakom and Pathumma Kayalpuram. Moulavi - Haleema couple had one son Abdul Salam. Haleema died soon after the birth of their first child. A year later, Moulavi married Aamina Ummal. The couple had ten children, includes Abdul Hai, Abdul Vahab, Abdul Khader Jr. Abdul Haque, Obaidullah, Ameena, Yahiya, Sakeena, Mohammed Eeza and Mohammed Iqbal. His sons, Abdul Salam, Abdul Vahab and Mohammed Eeza were writers and scholars of Islamic studies, and Abdul Khader Jr was a writer, literary critic and journalist. One of his nephews, Vakkom Majeed, was an Indian freedom fighter and a former member of Travancore-Cochin State Assembly and another nephew, P.Habeeb Mohamed, was the first Muslim judge of the Travancore High Court of Kerala. His disciples included K.M Seethi Sahib, the former Speaker of Kerala Legislative Assembly and a social reformer among kerala Muslims.\n\nMaulavi started the \"Swadeshabhimani\" newspaper on 19 January 1905, declaring that the paper will not hesitate to expose injustices to the people in any form, but on 26 September 1910, the newspaper and press were sealed and confiscated by the British Police, and the editor Ramakrishna Pillai was arrested and banished from Travancore to Thirunelveli.\n\nAfter the confiscation of the press, Moulavi concentrated more on social and cultural activities, becoming a social leader, also writing several books. \"Daussabah\" and \"Islam Matha Sidantha Samgraham\" are original works, while \"Imam Ghazali's Keemiya-e- Saadat\", \"Ahlu Sunnathuwal Jammath\", \"Islamic Sandesam\", \"Surat-ul fathiha\" are translations.\n\nMoulavi is considered as one of the greatest reformers in the Kerala Muslim community, and is sometimes referred to as the \"father of muslim renaissance\". He emphasised the religious and socioeconomic aspects much more than the ritualistic aspects of religion. He also campaigned for the need for modern education, the education of women, and the elimination of potentially bad customs among the Muslim community. Influenced by the writings of Muhammad Abduh of Egypt and his reform movement, Moulavi started journals in Arabi-Malayalam and in Malayalam modelled on Al Manar. The \"Muslim\" was launched in January 1906 and was followed by \"Al-Islam\"(1918) and \"Deepika\"(1931). Through these publications, he tried to teach the Muslim community about the basic tenets of Islam. \"Al-Islam\" began publishing in April 1918 and played a pivotal role in Muslim renaissance in Kerala. It opposed \"Nercha\"s and Uroos festivals amongst the Muslim community, thereby attracting opposition from the orthodox ulema to the extent that they issued a fatwa declaring the reading of it as sacrilege. Financial troubles and lack of readership led to the closure of the journal within five issues, but it is regarded as the pioneer journal that attempted religious reform amongst the Mappilas of Kerala. While it was published in Malayalam language using Arabi-Malayalam script, \"Muslim\" and \"Deepika\" used Malayalam in script also.\n\nAs a result of the continuous campaigning of Moulavi throughout the State, the Maharaja's Government introduced the teaching of Arabic in all state schools where there were Muslim pupils, and offered them fee concessions and scholarships. Girls were totally exempted from payment of fees. Moulavi wrote text books for children to learn Arabic, and a manual for training Arabic instructors for primary schools. At the instance of Moulavi Abdul Qadir the State Government soon instituted qualifying examinations for Arabic teachers of which he was made the chief examiner.\n\nThere were many other dubious practices in the Muslim community of the time, such as the dowry system, extravagant expenditure on weddings, celebration of annual \"urs\" and Moharrum with bizarre unIslamic features bordering on idolatrous rituals. Moulavi launched his campaign against such practices with the help of his disciples, and with the co-operation of other learned men who shared his views and ideals. As the campaign developed into a powerful movement, opposition was mounted by the Mullahs. Some issued \"fatwas\" that he was a \"kafir\", others branded him as a \"Wahhabi\".\n\nHe also tried to create unity among Muslims, starting the \"All Travancore Muslim Mahajanasabha\" and \"Chirayinkil Taluk Muslim Samajam\", and worked as the chairman of the Muslim Board of the Government of Travancore. His activities were further instrumental in the establishment of \"Muslim Aikya Sangham\", a united Muslim forum in Eriyad, Kodungalloor for all the Muslims of the Travancore, Cochin and Malabar regions,with K M Moulavi, K M Seethi Sahib, Manappat Kunju Mohammed Haji and helped guide the Lajnathul Mohammadiyya Association of Alappuzha, Dharma Bhoshini Sabha of Kollam amongst others.\nIn 1931, he founded the \"Islamia Publishing House\", with his eldest son Abdul Salam supervising the translation into Malayalam and publication of Allama Shibli's biography of Omar Farooq in two volumes under the title \"Al Farooq\".\n\nIn \"Deepika\", he serialised the Malayalam translation of the Quran, together with his brief commentary and the original text written in an elegant calligraphic style by Moulavi himself.

{"id": "10938771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10938771", "title": "Vedic Sanskrit grammar", "text": "Vedic Sanskrit grammar\n\nVedic Sanskrit is the Indo-Aryan language used in the religious hymns known as the Vedas, composed from the early-to-mid 2nd millennium through to the mid 1st millennium, BCE. It was a spoken language during that period. Its grammar differs in certain respects from the grammar of the later Classical Sanskrit.\n\nCompared with Classical Sanskrit, Vedic had a subjunctive mood absent in Pāṇini's grammar and generally believed to have disappeared by then at least in common sentence constructions. All tenses could be conjugated in the subjunctive and optative moods, in contrast to Classical Sanskrit, with no subjunctive and only a present optative. However, the old first-person subjunctive forms were used to complete the Classical Sanskrit imperative. The three synthetic past tenses (imperfect, perfect and aorist) were still clearly distinguished semantically in (at least the earliest) Vedic. A fifth mood, the injunctive, also existed.\n\nLong-\"i\" stems differentiate the Devi and Vrkis feminines, a difference lost in Classical Sanskrit.\n\n\nVedic is a highly inflected language with three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) and three numbers (singular, plural, dual). It has eight cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, and locative.\n\nIn this article nouns are divided into five declensions. The declension which a noun belongs to is determined largely by form.\n\nThe basic scheme is given in the table below — valid for almost all nouns and adjectives. However, according to the gender and the ending consonant/vowel of the uninflected word-stem, there are predetermined rules of compulsory \"sandhi\" which would then give the final inflected word.\n\nA-stems ( and ) (also known as thematic stems) comprise the largest class of nouns. As a rule, nouns belonging to this class, with the uninflected stem ending in short-a (), are either masculine or neuter. Nouns ending in long-ā () are almost always feminine. A-stem adjectives take the masculine and neuter in short-a (), and feminine in long-ā () in their stems. This class is so big because it also comprises the Proto-Indo-European o-stems.\n\nĪ- and ū -stems are only feminine.\n-stems are predominantly agental derivatives like neut. ' 'giver', though also include kinship terms like masc. ' 'father', ' 'nephew', \"\" 'brother' and fem. ' 'mother', ' 'daughter' and ' 'sister'.\n\nOne other notable feature of the nominal system is the very common use of nominal compounds, which may be huge (10+ words) as in some modern languages such as German. Nominal compounds occur with various structures, however morphologically speaking they are essentially the same. Each noun (or adjective) is in its (weak) stem form, with only the final element receiving case inflection. Some examples of nominal compounds include:\n\n\nThe first and second person pronouns are declined for the most part alike, having by analogy assimilated themselves with one another.\n\nNote: Where two forms are given, the second is enclitic and an alternative form. Ablatives in singular and plural may be extended by the syllable \"-tas\"; thus \"mat\" or \"mattas\", \"asmat\" or \"asmattas\".\nThe demonstrative \"ta\", declined below, also functions as the third person pronoun.\nInterrogative pronoun \"ka\" 'what' is declined in the same way, except neuter Sg.Nom./Acc. having \"kim\" (also \"kam\", \"kad\") form.\n\nThe cardinal numbers from one to ten are:\n\n\nAll numbers are declinable. \"Aika\" is declined like a pronominal adjective, though the dual form does not occur. \"D(u)vāu\" appears only in the dual. \"Tri\", \"catur\" and \"\" are declined irregularly. The numbers from 5 to 19 do not have any difference in genders.\nThe numbers from 11 to 19 are:\n\naikādaśam, dvādaśam, trayaudaśam, caturdaśam, pañcadaśam, , saptadaśam, , navadaśam.\n\nThe tens from 20 to 90 are:\n\n(, , , pañcāśat, , saptati, aśīti, navati.\n\nThe joint numbers:\n\n21 - , 22 - , 23 - , ..., 26 - , ..., but 82 - dvāśīti, 83 - trayāśīti, 88 - .\n\nThe hundreds are:\n\nśatam, dvai śatai, śatāni / tri śatam, etc.\n\n1000 - sahasra.\n\nThe ordinal numbers from one to ten are:\n\n\nOther numbers:\n\n11. - aikādaśas, ... 20. - (), 30. - (), 40. - , 50. - pañcāśattamas, 60. - , 70. - saptatitamas, 80. - aśītitamas, 90. - navatitamas, 100. - śatatamas, 1000. - sahasratamas.\n\nSanskrit has ten classes of verbs divided into two broad groups: athematic and thematic. The thematic verbs are so called because an \"a\", called the theme vowel, is inserted between the stem and the ending. This serves to make the thematic verbs generally more regular. Exponents used in verb conjugation include prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and reduplication. Every root has (not necessarily all distinct) zero, , and grades. If V is the vowel of the zero grade, the -grade vowel is traditionally thought of as a + V, and the -grade vowel as ā + V.\n\nThe verbs tenses (a very inexact application of the word, since more distinctions than simply tense are expressed) are organized into four 'systems' (as well as gerunds and infinitives, and such creatures as intensives/frequentatives, desideratives, causatives, and benedictives derived from more basic forms) based on the different stem forms (derived from verbal roots) used in conjugation. There are four tense systems:\n\nThe present system includes the present tense, the imperfect, and the optative and imperative moods, as well as some of the remnant forms of the old subjunctive. The tense stem of the present system is formed in various ways. The numbers are the native grammarians' numbers for these classes.\n\nFor thematic verbs, the present tense stem may be formed through:\n\nFor athematic verbs, the present tense stem may be formed through:\n\nThe present system also differentiates strong and weak forms of the verb. The strong/weak opposition manifests itself differently depending on the class:\n\nThe perfect is only used in the indicative. The stem is formed with reduplication as with the present system.\n\nThe perfect system also produces separate \"strong\" and \"weak\" forms of the verb — the strong form is used with the singular active, and the weak form with the rest.\n\nThe perfect in the Sanskrit can be in form of the simple perfect and the periphrastic perfect. The only perfect is in the indicative. The simple perfect is the most common form and can be made from most of the roots. The simple perfect stem is made by reduplication and if necessary by stem lengthening. The conjugated form takes special perfect endings. The periphrastic perfect is used with causative, desiderative, denominative and roots with prosodic long anlauted vowel (except a/ā). Only few roots can form both the simple and the periphrastic perfect. These are ' 'carry', ' 'burn', \"vid\" 'know', \"bhi\" 'to be afraid', \"hu\" 'sacrifice'.\n\nThe aorist system includes aorist proper (with past indicative meaning, e.g. \"abhūs\" 'you were') and some of the forms of the ancient injunctive (used almost exclusively with \"mā\" in prohibitions, e.g. \"mā bhūs\" 'don't be'). The principal distinction of the two is presence/absence of an augment – \"a-\" prefixed to the stem.\n\nThe aorist system stem actually has three different formations: the simple aorist, the reduplicating aorist (semantically related to the causative verb), and the sibilant aorist. The simple aorist is taken directly from the root stem (e.g. \"bhū-\": \"a-bhū-t\" 'he was'). The reduplicating aorist involves reduplication as well as vowel reduction of the stem. The sibilant aorist is formed with the suffixation of \"s\" to the stem. The sibilant aorist by itself has four formations:\n\nThe future system is formed with the suffixation of \"-sya-\" or ' and , both in the simple future and conditional. There exists also so called periphrastic future, which is made by adding suffix ' to the stem and the short \"as\" 'to be' form.\n\nEach verb has a grammatical voice, whether active, passive or middle. There is also an impersonal voice, which can be described as the passive voice of intransitive verbs. Sanskrit verbs have an indicative, an optative and an imperative mood. Older forms of the language had a subjunctive, though this had fallen out of use by the time of Classical Sanskrit.\n\nConjugational endings in Vedic convey person, number, and voice. Different forms of the endings are used depending on what tense stem and mood they are attached to. Verb stems or the endings themselves may be changed or obscured by sandhi.\n\nPrimary endings are used with present indicative and future forms. Secondary endings are used with the imperfect, conditional, aorist, and optative. Perfect, imperative and subjunctive endings are used with the perfect, imperative and subjunctive respectively.\n\nIn present and imperfect indicative singular active forms have the accent on the stem and take strong forms, while the other forms have the accent on the endings and take weak forms.\n\nIn imperative accent is variable and affects vowel quality. Forms which are end-accented trigger strengthening, and those with stem accent do not have the vowel affected.\n\nThe Passive voice forms for all tenses and moods are made by adding \"-ya-\" to the zero-grade stem and then adding the middle voice ending of appropriate tense and mood.\n\nThe Causative is made by adding the suffix \"aya\" to the form. For example, \"karauti\" 'he does/makes', and \"kārayati\" 'he lets do/make'.\n\nThe Desiderative is made by reduplication of the root and the suffix \"sa\". For example, \"karauti\" 'he does, makes', and ' 'he wishes to do/make'. It can be also combined with causative, e.g. \"kārayati\" 'he lets do' and ' 'he wishes to let to do'.\n\nThe Intensive (or sometimes called Frequentative) describes a repeated or particularly intensive activity. With verbs of the movement it means \"back and forth\". The intensive is formed by reduplication of the root and the suffix \"ya\" with middle endings for thematic stems, and without suffix and active endings for athematic stems. For example, \"bhramati\" 'it curves around', and \"\" 'it curves cross and crosswise around'.\n\n\nThe present indicative takes primary endings.\nThe imperfect takes secondary endings and adds augment \"a-\" before stem.\nThe aorist takes secondary endings.\nThe perfect takes perfect endings.\nThe optative takes secondary endings. \"-ya-\" is added to the stem both in the active and the middle. In some forms the cluster \"ya\" is dropped out.\nThe imperative takes imperative endings.\nThe subjunctive takes subjunctive endings.\nThe future takes primary endings. \" is added to the stem, both in the active and the middle/passive.\nThe second or periphrastic future is made by adding suffix \" to the stem and the short \"as\" 'to be' form, except 3rd person, both singular and plural, having feminine -stem nominative endings, e.g., \"bhavi-\" + \"tā\" + \"asmi\" = \"bhavitāsmi\", but \"bhavi-\" + \"tā/tārāu/tāras\" = \"bhavitā/bhavitārāu/bhavitāras\". The passive forms are identical to the middle forms.\n\nThe conditional takes secondary endings. \"\" is added to the stem, both in the active and the middle/passive.\nThe following stems can take all endings.\n\n\nThe \"as\" 'to be' has the long and the short form. The long form is very rarely used.\n\nBecause of Vedic's complex declension system the word order is free (with tendency toward SOV).\n\n\n\n\n"}

He completed his high school education at Bhavsingh High School in Porbandar, India. He studied law in Mumbai, India and returned to Porbandar in 1933 to start his law practice. Four years later he took a position as judge in a British court. However, due to his passion for bird watching he wrote regular articles for \"Prakruti\" () magazine on birds\n\nIn 1944, the freedom fighter in British India named Dr. Vasant Avsare () came to Porbandar and asked Vijaygupta Maurya to fight for his case. However, as Vijaygupta Maurya was already at the position of judge, he could not do so. This prompted Vijaygupta Maurya to resign from his position and took Dr. Avsare's case as a regular lawyer. This ended Vijaygupta Maurya's career as judge and he decided to stay in Mumbai. He found a job as a typist for the salary of Rs. 0.75 per month at \"Gordhandas ni Pedhi\" ().\n\nIn between financial struggles he kept writing for Prakruti magazine. After a few years, he got an opportunity to write for the Gujarati newspaper \"Janmabhumi\". He started writing articles about birds and other animals for the last page of \"Janambhumi Pravasi\" with limited space and eventually grew to become editor/writer of entire page and wrote on varied subjects from the universe, science, marine life, plant life and so on.\n\nIn 1973, he left \"Janmabhumi Pravasi\" and became a freelance journalist writing for various magazines. He also wrote several books during that time that included the theme of serving interesting factual information rolled up in stories as well as other books based on true stories. His career as a writer spanned over 46 years, however it didn't help him much financially. During later years he encountered several physical problems including poor vision, continuous back pain and Parkinson's disease. After a long illness he died in July 1992.\n\nHis sons, Nagendra Vijay and Bhardvaj Vijay, has accepted similar goals and career as their father. Nagendra Vijay started writing at the age of 14 and pioneered the first Gujarati science magazine Scope and later Safari magazine. His grandson, Harshal Pushkarna, has also continued work on spreading science and knowledge by currently running Safari magazine.\n\nSome of the Gujarati books authored by Vijaygupta Maurya\n"}

{"id": "23607308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23607308", "title": "Wildland–urban interface", "text": "Wildland–urban interface\n\nA wildland–urban interface (or WUI) is a zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. Communities that are within of the zone may also be included. These lands and communities adjacent to and surrounded by wildlands are at risk of wildfires.\n\nThe US Forest Service defines the wildland-urban interface as the place where \"homes and wildlands meet or intermingle\", or more specifically, where \"humans and their development meet or intermix with wildland fuel\". A more quantitative definition is provided by the Federal Register, which defines WUI areas as those containing at least one housing unit per 40 acres. Federal Register definitions can be combined with quantitative criteria to classify the WUI into two categories:\n\n\nThe main difference between these types of WUI are that homes in intermix WUI are interspersed with vegetation, whereas homes in interface WUI are adjacent to heavy vegetation.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2000, WUI area in the United States increased by 18 percent, covering 6 million additional homes. As of 2013, it was reported that the number of wildfires in the United States exceeding 50,000 acres had been steadily increasing since 1983, with the bulk of the change occurring from 2003 to 2013. The intensity of these fires was found to be increasing as well, contributing to an observed increase in costs related to reducing fire risks, fighting wildfires, and protecting property. WUI growth has also been noted in other places throughout the world, including Argentina, France, South Africa, Australia, and Mediterranean regions.\n\nFactors behind WUI growth include population growth, housing growth in wildland areas, population shifts, and the expansion of cities into wildlands. In the United States, WUI growth is partially attributed to population shifts towards the West and South. Additionally, as of 2013, the migration of retiring baby-boomers to smaller communities closer to scenic natural resources (“amenity migration”) is expected to contribute to WUI growth as well.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2010, the WUI was the fastest-growing land use type in the United States, and 97% of new WUI areas were the result of new housing rather than increases in wildlife vegetation.\n\nKeane, et al. attribute the increase in WUI area to ecological factors such as climate change, insect pests, and diseases, which have resulted in more arid and flammable landscapes. Climate change can result in significant shifts in wildlife composition due to changes in temperature and precipitation. Population shifts can result in unintended ecological consequences resulting in higher landscape flammability. For example, flammable materials present in housing serve as a direct means of wildfire spread, while landscaping can cause non-native species to spread.\n\nTo a small degree, vegetation growth into or near settled areas can lead to WUI growth. Between 1990 and 2010, vegetation growth accounted for 3% of all WUI growth in the United States.\n\nEnvironmental issues related to WUI growth extend beyond the increased risk of wildfire damage to human settlements. For example, housing growth in WUI regions can displace and fragment native vegetation. Additionally, the introduction of non-native species by humans through landscaping can change the wildlife composition of interface regions. Other factors can also have impacts on the environment, including pets which can kill large quantities of wildlife.\n\nForest fragmentation is another impact of WUI growth, which can lead to unintended ecological consequences. For instance, increased forest fragmentation can lead to an increase in the prevalence of Lyme disease. One possible reason for this effect is the production of high-density isolated populations of transmission vectors such as ticks and mice. Isolated forest patches in fragmented environments tend to be surrounded by unfavorable habitats, which hinders the dispersal of infected species and increases their local density. Additionally, disease vectors in isolated patches can undergo genetic differentiation, increasing their survivability as a whole.\n\nIncreases in wildfire risk pose a threat to conservation in WUI growth regions. Between 1985-94 and 2005-14, the area burned by wildfires in the United States nearly doubled from 18,000 to 33,000 square kilometers, and this increase can partly be attributed to WUI growth. In North America, Chile, and Australia, unnaturally high fire frequencies have resulted in incidences of exotic annual grasses replacing native shrublands.\n\nAs of 2013, 32 percent of homes, apartments, and other human dwellings in the United States are contained within the WUI, and this figure is expected to grow over time. Wildfires can pose a risk to any area containing vegetation, as embers transported by wind can ignite fires a mile or more away from a flame front. The increase in wildfire prevalence in the United States between 1985-94 and 2005-14 resulted in a tripling of federal wildfire suppression expenditures from $0.4 billion per year to $1.4 billion per year, indicating that wildfires pose a potent economic risk to communities.\n\nGeospatial quantification of wildfire risk can highlight key areas for policy and emergency response planning. Several factors are used to assess the threat wildfires pose to human settlements. These factors can mainly be divided into ecological factors (e.g. climate, seasonal weather patterns, and vegetation) and human factors (e.g. arrangement and density of housing). Quantitative risk assessments can be produced by combining data such as the probability of large wildfires, estimated wildfire intensity, population density, and the proximity of human settlements to roads. One approach, used by Haas et al., combines geographical data on population density and probability of exposure to a large wildfire to produce maps that highlight spatial variability in wildfire risk. The highest-risk areas identified by this method are those where moderate population levels overlap with or are adjacent to wildlands with high chances of wildfire exposure.\n\nPopulation density correlates with wildfire risk for two main reasons. First, people can cause fires; from 2001 to 2011, 85% of wildfires recorded by National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) were caused by people. Second, housing can intensify wildfires because they can potentially contain highly flammable material such wood shakes, and can be a source for mobile embers which can cause wildfires to spread.\n\nThe relationship between population density and wildfire risk is non-linear. At low population densities, human ignitions are low, and ignitions increase with population density. However, in a range of environments sampled from North America, the Mediterranean Basin, Chile, and South Africa, a threshold of population density was observed at which fire occurrence decreased. Possible reasons for this decrease include decreases in open space for ember transmission, fuel fragmentation due to urban development, and higher availability of fire-suppression resources. For this reason, areas with moderate population densities tend to exhibit higher wildfire risk than areas with low or high population densities.\n\nSome factors typically used in wildfire simulations include historical spatial wildfire data, geographic features, geographical distributions of vegetation, and climate. One algorithm commonly used to simulate wildfire spread are Minimum Travel Time (MTT) algorithms. Prior to MTT algorithms, fire boundaries were primarily modeled through the application of Huygens' principle by treating boundaries as wave fronts on a two-dimensional surface. MTT algorithms are capable of calculating fire perimeters in a nearly-equivalent way finding the minimum time it takes for a fire to travel between two points, and are advantageous due to their speed and scalability. However, MTT methods come at the cost of assuming nearly-constant environmental conditions such as wind direction and fuel moisture dynamics, and thus tend to be more apt for short-timescale simulations.\n\nThe vulnerability of a community to wildfires is partly determined by its decisions regarding land use, building standards, and landscaping choices. Community-focused risk management efforts often focused on reducing the flammability of dwellings and wildland vegetation in and around high-risk areas.\n\nCalkin, et al. present a conceptual framework for risk mitigation in the WUI. In this model, two major objectives that lead to decreased home loss are (a) reducing the probability of home exposure to wildfires and (b) reducing the susceptibility of houses to wildfire loss. The former can be split into three actionable objectives: reducing wildfire occurrence, reducing wildfire size and intensity, and reducing human development in fire-prone areas. The latter can be converted into a single actionable objective, i.e. increasing home resistance to ignition. In the framework, responsibility for actions is attributed to three major groups: land management agencies, local governments, and homeowners. Land management agencies can help reduce wildfire occurrence through ignition prevention, and can help reduce wildfire size and intensity through fuel and vegetation management, building community preparedness, and responding to wildfires with suppression efforts. Local governments can help reduce human development in fire-proof areas through proper land use management and zoning. Individual homeowners can also reduce the risk of home loss by taking action to manage the flammability of their homes.\n\nOne approach to mitigating fire risk is adapting communities to adapt to fire risks rather than escalate prevention efforts. Fire-adapted communities are defined by the United States Forest Service as \"a knowledgeable and engaged community in which the awareness and actions of residents regarding infrastructure, buildings, landscaping, and the surrounding ecosystem lessens the need for extensive protection actions and enables the community to safely accept fire as a part of the surrounding landscape.\" Fostering the development of a fire-adapted community can help save resources for local and federal governments by reducing the amount of resources needed for fire mitigation.\n\nThe susceptibility of a home to ignition is determined by its home ignition zone (HIZ), or the home and its surrounding area up to 100-200 feet. Individual homeowners can use the following guidelines to determine what areas of their home can be improved to mitigate fire risk:\n\n\nWildfires are an ecological process that naturally contribute to the development of ecosystems, and many wildlands are historically predisposed to periodic fire. Because of this, complete eradication of fires in WUI regions is typically not feasible. Additionally, wildfires are capable of spreading through far distances, presenting logistical challenges to wildfire management efforts. At a governmental level, communities that have developed within or near fire-prone areas typically vary widely in terms of wildfire risk and preparedness, which can confound coordination efforts. Lastly, a mismatch between the reality of wildfire risk and sociopolitical expectations of wildland fire management services may lead to challenges to strategic risk management.\n\n\n"}
