{"id": "46626730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46626730", "title": "Athleisure", "text": "Athleisure\n\nAthleisure is a trend in fashion in which clothing designed for workouts and other athletic activities is worn in other settings, such as at the workplace, at school, or at other casual or social occasions. Athleisure outfits are yoga pants, tights, sneakers, leggings and shorts, that \"look like athletic wear\" and are characterized as \"fashionable, dressed up sweats and exercise clothing\". The idea is that gym clothes are supposedly making their way out of the gym and becoming a larger part of people's everyday wardrobes.\n\nAthleisure can be considered as a fashion industry movement, enabled by improved textile materials, which allow sportswear to be more versatile, comfortable, and fashionable. \n\nBy some accounts, the athleisure trend grew out of women wearing yoga pants. Another account suggests that the trend came about because people could wear them for multiple occasions without having to change, which meant greater convenience since people did not have to carry an extra gym outfit on the way to the office, for example. A decade ago, denim workwear uniforms were more popular, but today, athleisure is increasingly popular in places such as public streets and fashion stores and fashion runways. Sportswear that had been worn exclusively in gyms is now being worn elsewhere by young adults and fitness-conscious consumers and has been accompanied by a relaxation in dress codes. Its popularity may have stemmed from its ability to fill a gap in the market, when sportswear was once merely functional rather than stylish. Due to innovations in textiles and technology, improvements have been made in functionality, such that garments and footwear have become more breathable, lightweight, and waterproof. The new garments are performance enhancing, in the sense that they allow wearers to carry out everyday activities easily.\n\nAthleisure buyers desire the active lifestyle that comes with each purchase. The styles, colors, and fabrics of athleisure suggest a broader emphasis on fashion as opposed to functionality. \n\nReports in \"USA Today\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\" describe the athleisure market as growing, displacing typical workwear styles, and cutting in to sales of jeans, with a market size in 2014 as $35 billion, representing an 8% increase from the previous year. According to one estimate, the athleisure market, including footwear, was $270 billion in 2016, and was estimated to grow by 30% by the year 2020.\n\nIn 2016, the global athleisure sector was valued at over $83 billion USD, while the U.S. market reported a 16% increase to $44 billion USD. A 30% growth is also predicted in Asia and the U.S. by 2020. Furthermore, analysts at Morgan Stanley, believe that global sales may therefore rise to over $350 billion USD.\n\nIn spite of this, there is an arising issue regarding market saturation, due to the continuous entry of traditional luxury, and mass merchant brands, tapping into this trend. The athleisure market for casual athletic clothing, which took off a few years ago, also has become increasingly crowded with big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, as well as fast-fashion brands joining the fray—often at cheaper prices. An analyst estimated that the athleisure market was not slowing down, with much competition and pressure on various retail outlets including sporting goods stores. Therefore, the best performing brands have proven their ability to withstand the emerging competition, as they sell clothes and a lifestyle as a package.\n\nGlobal shifts toward a rise in health and fitness trends has led to growing interest and participation in sports among the public. Many have actively joined clubs and competitions in order to fully adopt the characteristics of this lifestyle. Consequently, sportswear brands can utilize this opportunity to improve and introduce better quality apparel, footwear, and gear. By presenting their devotion towards a lifestyle, it thus allows brands to garner customer loyalty.\n\nAthleisure has been promoted by celebrities such as Beyoncé and Rihanna. The athleisure market is characterized by continuous innovation and brand differentiation.\n\nNew fibers enable greater odor reduction, sweat-wicking, stretchability to conform to the body's shape, breathability to allow air in and out, and protection from dirt. Some clothing designs permit selected parts of the clothing to allow more breathability while other parts can have greater tension, perhaps as a way to aid posture. A type of athleisure is sometimes called \"technical wear\" which describes clothes that are more suitable for wearing to the office while being comfortable.\n\nThere have been concerns that materials used in athleisure may have negative consequences for the environment; these chemicals include dyes and solvents and polyfluorinated chemicals which are used to make athleisure resistant to water and grease and stains.\n\n"}
{"id": "57767221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57767221", "title": "Bhāṇaka", "text": "Bhāṇaka\n\nBhāṇakas (Pali: reciter) were Buddhist monks who specialized in the memorization and recitation of a specific collection of texts within the Buddhist canon. Lineages of bhāṇakas were responsible for preserving and transmitting the teachings of the Buddha until the canon was committed to writing in the 1st Century BC, and declined as the oral transmission of early Buddhism was replaced by writing.\n\nAcademic consensus and Buddhist tradition holds that all early Buddhist traditions preserved their texts via oral transmission- significant evidence of this includes the structure and distinctive features of early Buddhist texts, the absence of Vinaya regulations dealing with writing and writing materials, and terms derived from practices of listening and recitation used to describe the Buddha's teaching and the acts of the early Sangha. \n\nThe bhāṇaka system is believed to have originated in India, but the majority of the literary and inscriptional evidence relating to bhāṇakas comes from Sri Lanka. Scholars suspect that the same techniques were used by the monks of all early Buddhist schools to fix and transmit the contents of the Agamas, but outside of the Theravada tradition little information about the pre-literary period of these traditions is available. The earliest evidence for the association of monks known as bhāṇaka with knowledge and recitation of specific parts of the Buddhist canon dates to the 2nd or 3rd Century BCE.\n\nAll schools of Buddhism agree that shortly after the death of the Buddha, a council of his senior students was held to clarify and record his teachings. At this gathering (known as the First Buddhist Council), Upali was questioned regarding the contents of the Vinaya and Ananda was similarly questioned regarding the Dhamma. Once the council had agreed on the contents of the teachings, they acknowledged their acceptance of the sutras by reciting them together. \n\nSubsequent major and minor councils are depicted as following the same basic procedure to compare, correct, and fix the contents of the canon, with specialists in each area of the collection called upon to recite the complete text for confirmation by the gathered Sangha.\n\nBuddhaghosa reported that according to the oral tradition of the Mahavihara, each of the four Nikayas were entrusted to an individual elder of the early Sangha and their students for preservation. Ananda was given responsibility for the Digha Nikaya, Sariputta for the Majjhima Nikaya, Mahakassapa for the Samyutta Nikaya, and Anuruddha for the Anguttara Nikaya.\n\nScholars doubt that the sutras and four Nikayas were established in their final form this early, with K.R. Norman suggesting that this story may be a reflection of later practices. Some texts of the Theravada Abhidhamma Pitaka and Khuddaka Nikaya clearly originate after the First Council, but Theravadins have generally regarded portions of the Abhidhamma as being included at this stage as part of the dhamma/suttas. Texts known to have relatively late origins (after the Third Council) are included in the Theravada accounts of the First Council. Texts that did not fit into any of the four Nikayas were assigned to the Khuddaka (which included the Abhidhamma in some traditions).\n\nIn the Theravada commentaries, references are found to bhāṇakas that specialized in each of the four Nikayas, as well as Jataka-bhāṇakas, Dhammapada-bhāṇakas, and Khuddaka-bhāṇakas. Each group of bhāṇakas was responsible for reciting and teaching their texts, and seem to have exercised independent judgement as to how their texts were organized and the versions of stories and doctrines that they preserved- variant readings between versions of content preserved in both the Digha Nikaya and Majjhima Nikaya, for instance, may be attributable to the preservation of different versions by different schools of bhāṇakas. Different schools of bhāṇakas may have 'closed' their canon at different times, and seem to have differed in some cases in which texts of the Khuddaka Nikaya and Abhidharma Pitaka they accepted as canonical. \n\nStupa inscriptions from India dating to the 2nd Century BCE mention bhāṇakas who specialized in teaching the sutras or knew the four Nikayas/Agamas but do not represent them as specializing in a single Nikaya. By contrast, cave inscriptions from Sri Lanka ranging in date from the 3rd Century BCE to the 1st Century CE make specific references to monks who specialized in the Samyutta Nikaya, Majjhima Nikaya, or Anguttara Nikaya. Roles as bhāṇaka of a particular Nikaya were passed down from teacher to student.\n\nKR Norman suggests that the Theravada practice of organizing bhāṇakas by Nikaya may not have originated until after the Second Buddhist Council. The Dipavamsa mentions a 'nine-fold' organization of the early texts being divided into individual chapters at the First Council, which may reflect an earlier method of organization.\n\nReferences to \"abhidhammikas\" (specialists in the Abhidhamma) but not to Abhidhamma-bhāṇakas in the Milindapanha may suggest that the bhāṇaka system originated before the Abhidhamma Pitaka was 'closed' by the Theravadins (dated by them to the era of Ashoka at the Third Buddhist Council) but, since the Abhidhamma may have been recited by some variety of sutta-bhāṇaka, could also indicate that being a specialist in a branch of texts was distinct from being responsible for its recitation.\n\nNo fixed date has been established for the end of the bhāṇaka tradition, but scholars generally believe that the tradition went into decline as the Buddhist canon increasingly began to be preserved through written texts. Buddhaghosa wrote about the bhāṇakas as though they were contemporary in approximately the 5th Century CE, but may have been reflecting the perspective of the earlier Sinhala commentaries- his remarks don't definitively establish that the bhāṇaka practice persisted into his own era.\n\nThe Culavamsa refers to a bhāṇaka as late as the 13th Century CE, but by this date the term may have become generic for a preacher or specialist in recitation, rather than a monk who preserved a significant portion of the canon by memory.\n\n"}

When used together, however, these two methods can generate a more complete picture of the time course and interactivity of bilingual language processing according to the BIA+ model. These methods, however, do need to be considered carefully as overlapping activation areas in the brain do not imply that there is no functional separation between the two languages at the neuronal or higher-order level.\n\n\n According to the BIA+ model shown in the figure, during word identification, the visual input activates the sublexical orthographic representations which simultaneously activate both the orthographic whole-word lexical and the sublexical phonological representations. Both whole-word orthographic and phonological representations then activate the semantic representations and language nodes which indicate membership to a particular language. All of this information is then used in the task/decision subsystem to carry out the remainder of the task at hand. The two subsystems are further described by the assumptions associated with them below.\n\n The integrated lexicon assumption describes the interactivity of the visual representation of word or word parts and orthography, the phonologic or auditory component of language processing, and the semantic or significance and meaning representations of words. This theory was tested with orthographic neighbors, words of the same length that differ by one letter only (e.g. BALL and FALL). The number of target and non-target language neighbors influenced target word processing in both the primary language (L1) and the secondary language (L2). This cross-language neighborhood effect was supposed to reflect a co-activation of words whatever the language they belong to, that is a lexical access that is language nonselective. Both target and nontarget languages can be automatically and unconsciously activated even in a pure monolingual mode. This does not imply, however, that there may not be features unique to one language (i.e. the use of different alphabets) or that, at the semantic level, there are no shared features.\n\n This assumption states that language nodes/tags exist to provide a representation for the language of membership based on the information from upstream orthographic and phonological word ID processes. According to the BIA+ model, these tags have no effect on the activation level representation of words. The focus of activation of these nodes is postlexical: the existence of these nodes enables bilingual individuals not to get too much interference from the nontarget language while they process one of their language.\n\n Parallel access assumes that language is nonselective and that both potential word choices are activated in the bilingual brain when exposed to the same stimulus. For example, test subjects reading in their second language have been found to unconsciously translate to their primary language. N400 stimulus response activation measurements show that semantic priming effects were seen in both languages and an individual cannot consciously focus their attention to only one language, even when told to ignore the second.\nThis language nonselective lexical access has been shown during semantic activation across languages, but also at the orthographic and phonological levels.\n\n The temporal delay assumption is based on the principle of resting potential activation which reflects the frequency of word use by the bilingual such that high frequency words correlate to high resting level activation potentials, and words used with little frequency correlate to low resting level activation potentials. A high resting potential is one that is less negative or closer to zero, the point of activation, and therefore needs less stimuli in order to become activated. Because the less commonly used words of L2 have a lower resting level activation, L1 is likely to be activated before L2 as seen by N400 ERP patterns. \n\n The locations of many of the word identification processing tasks have been determined with fMRI studies. Word retrieval is localized in Broca's area of the prefrontal cortex, whereas storage of information is localized in the inferior temporal lobes.\nGlobally, the same brain areas have been shown to be activated across the L1 and L2 in highly proficient bilinguals. Some subtle differences between L1 and L2 activations emerge though when testing lower proficient bilinguals.\n\n The task/decision subsystem of the BIA+ model determines which actions must be executed for the task at hand based on the relevant information that becomes available after word identification processing. This subsystem involves many of the executive processes including monitoring and control associated with the prefrontal cortex.\n\n Action plans that meet the task at hand are executed by the task/decision system on the basis of activation information from the word identification subsystem. Studies that tested bilinguals with homographs showed that conflicts between target and non-target language readings of the homographs still led to a difference in activation between it and a control, implying that bilinguals are not able to regulate activation in the word identification system. Therefore, the action plans of the task/decision system have no direct influence on activations of word identification language subsystem.\n\n The neural correlates of the task/ decision subsystem consist of multiple components that map onto different areas of prefrontal cortex responsible for executing control functions. For example, the general executive functions of language switching have been found to activate the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex areas.,\n\n According to the BIA+ model, when a bilingual with English as their primary language and Spanish as their secondary language translates the word \"advertencia\" from Spanish to English, several steps occur. The bilingual would use the orthographic and phonological cues to differentiate this word from the similar English word \"advertisement\". At this point, however, the bilingual automatically derives the semantic meaning of the word, not only for the correct Spanish meaning of advertencia which is \"warning\" but also for the Spanish meaning of advertisement which is \"publicidad\".\n\n While the BIA+ models shares several similarities with its predecessor, the BIA model, there are a few distinct differences that exist between the two. First and most notable is the purely bottom-up nature of the BIA+ model which assumes that information from the task/decision subsystem cannot influence the word identification subsystem, while the BIA model assumes that the two systems can fully interact.\n\nThe BIA+ model has been supported by many of the quantitative neuroimaging studies but more research needs to be completed in order to strengthen the model as a frontrunner in the accepted models for bilingual language processing. In the task/decision system, the task components are well-defined (e.g. translation, language switching) but the decision components involved in the execution of these tasks in the subsystem are underspecified. The relationship of the components in this subsystem need further exploration in order to be fully understood.\n\nScientists are also considering the use of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in future studies. This technology would link the spatial activation processes with the temporal patterns of brain response more accurately than simultaneously considering the response data from ERP and fMRI which are more limited.\n\nNot only have studies suggested that the executive functioning of bilingualism extends beyond the language system, but bilinguals have also been shown to be faster processors who display fewer conflict effects than monolinguals in attentional tasks This research implies that there may be some spillover effects of learning a second language on other areas of cognitive function that could be explored.\n\nOne future direction theories on bilingual word recognition should take is the investigation of developmental aspects of bilingual lexical access. Most studies have investigated highly proficient bilinguals, but not many have looked at low-proficient bilinguals or even L2 learners. This new direction should prove to bring a lot of educational applications.\n"}
{"id": "76391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76391", "title": "Bislama", "text": "Bislama\n\nBislama (; ; also known under its earlier name in French ) is a creole language, one of the official languages of Vanuatu. It is the first language of many of the \"Urban ni-Vanuatu\" (those who live in Port Vila and Luganville), and the second language of much of the rest of the country's residents. \"Yumi, Yumi, Yumi\", the Vanuatu national anthem, is in Bislama.\n\nMore than 95% of Bislama words are of English origin; the remainder combines a few dozen words from French, as well as some vocabulary inherited from various languages of Vanuatu, essentially limited to flora and fauna terminology. While the influence of these vernacular languages is low on the vocabulary side, it is very high in the morphosyntax. Bislama can be basically described as a language with an English vocabulary and an Oceanic grammar and phonology.\n\nDuring the period of \"blackbirding\", in the 1870s and 1880s, hundreds of thousands of Pacific islanders (many of them from the New Hebrides – now the Vanuatu archipelago) were taken as indentured labourers or sometimes kidnapped and forced to work on plantations, mainly in Queensland, Australia and Fiji. With several languages being spoken in these plantations, a pidgin was formed, combining English vocabulary with grammatical structures typical of languages in the region. This early plantation pidgin is the origin not only of Bislama, but also of Tok Pisin of Papua New Guinea and Pijin of the Solomon Islands, though not of Torres Strait Creole north of Australia.\n\nThis pidgin started spreading over the Vanuatu archipelago at the turn of the 20th century, as the survivors of blackbirding began to come back to their native islands: knowledge of this pidgin would facilitate communication not only with European traders and settlers, but also between native populations, and because Vanuatu is the most language-dense country in the world (one count puts it at 113 languages for a population of 225,000), Bislama usefully serves as a lingua franca for communication between ni-Vanuatu, as well as with and even between foreigners. Although it has been a spoken-only language for most of its history, in 1995, has the first dictionary of Bislama been published. This, along with its second edition in 2004 has helped to create a uniform spelling of written Bislama.\n\nBesides Bislama, most ni-Vanuatu also know their local language, the local language of their father and that of their mother, and their spouse – and formal schools are taught in English or in French.\n\nThe name of Bislama (also referred to, especially in French, as \"Bichelamar\") comes via the early 19th century word \"Beach-la-Mar\" from pseudo-French \"biche de mer\" or \"bêche de mer\", sea cucumber, which itself comes from an alteration of the Portuguese \"bicho do mar\". In the early 1840s, sea cucumbers were also harvested and dried at the same time that sandalwood was gathered. The names \"biche-la-mar\" and 'Sandalwood English' came to be associated with the kind of pidgin that came to be used by the local laborers between themselves, as well as their English-speaking overseers.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson wrote in an account of his travels through the Pacific in 1888 and 1889, \"the natives themselves have often scraped up a little English ... or an efficient pidgin, what is called to the westward 'Beach-la-Mar'.\" In Jack London's story \"Yah! Yah! Yah!\", one of his \"South Sea Tales\", there is repeated a reference to \"a bastard lingo called \"bech-de-mer\"\", and much of the story's dialogue is conducted in it.\n\nToday, the word \"bislama\" itself is seldom used by younger speakers of Bislama to refer to sea slugs, as a new re-borrowing from pseudo-French \"bêche de mer\", which has taken the form \"besdemea\", has become more popular.\n\nIts alphabet uses A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, digraph NG, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, W, and Y; along with the \"AE\" and \"AO\".\n\nBefore 1995, an older orthography had an \"É\", (now written E); \"AI\" and \"AU\" instead of \"AE\" and \"AO\". For hiatus, \"AÏ\" and \"AÜ\" (now written \"AI\" and \"AU\") were used, and \"M̄\" was used for , and \"P̄\" for – the orthography after 1995 has no diacritics and writes these sounds as \"MW\" and \"PW\".\n\nTwo frequent words in Bislama are \"long\" and \"blong\", which take the place of many prepositions in English or French.\n\n\n\"Long\" holds many other related meanings, and is sometimes used in improvisation.\n\nOriginally from the English word \"belong\", \"blong\" takes the place of 'of' or the genitive case in other languages. Just like \"of\" in English, it is one of the most widely used and versatile words in the language, and can indicate possession, country of origin, defining characteristics, intention, and others.\n\n\nVerbs in Bislama usually consist of a stem word (borrowed from English, French or indigenous languages); most transitive verbs add to this a transitive suffix.\nThe form of that suffix is /-em/, /-im/, or /-um/, depending on vowel harmony. If the last vowel of the verb's stem is either -u- or -i-, then that vowel will be copied into the transitive suffix. For all other stem vowels, the transitive suffix has its default form /-em/:\nVerbs do not conjugate. The tense, aspect and mood of a sentence are indicated with markers such as \"stap\", \"bin\" and \"bae\" that are placed in the sentence.\n\n\nThe plural is formed by putting \"ol\" before the word. For example, \"bia\" 'beer'; \"ol bia\" = \"beers\". \"Ol\" comes from the English \"all\". When used with numbers, the singular form is used. 2 bia, 3 bia, etc.\n\nThe personal pronouns of Bislama feature four grammatical numbers (singular, dual, trial and plural). They also encode the clusivity distinction: 1st person non-singular pronouns (equivalent of English \"we\") are described as \"inclusive\" if they include the addressee (i.e. {you + I}, {you + I + others}), but \"exclusive\" otherwise (i.e. {I + other people}). Bislama pronouns do not decline.\n\n\nSome of these markers also have lexical meanings. For example, \"save\" can mean \"be able to\" but it is also a verb \"know\".\n\n\nDialects exist, based mainly on different pronunciations in different areas which stem from the different sounds of the native languages. The future tense marker can be heard to be said as: Bambae, Mbae, Nambae, or Bae. There are also preferences for using Bislama or native words that vary from place to place, and most people insert English, French, or local language words to fill out Bislama. So in the capital city it is common to hear 'computer'; in other places you might hear 'ordinateur'.\n\nThe longest written work in Bislama is the Bible completed in 1998.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3856722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3856722", "title": "Burr (edge)", "text": "Burr (edge)\n\nA burr is a raised edge or small piece of material remaining attached to a workpiece after a modification process.\n\nIt is usually an unwanted piece of material and is removed with a deburring tool in a process called 'deburring'. Burrs are most commonly created by machining operations, such as grinding, drilling, milling, engraving or turning. It may be present in the form of a fine wire on the edge of a freshly sharpened tool or as a raised portion of a surface; this type of burr is commonly formed when a hammer strikes a surface. Deburring accounts for a significant portion of manufacturing costs.\n\nIn the printmaking technique of drypoint, burr, which gives a rich fuzzy quality to the engraved line, is highly desirable—the great problem with the drypoint medium is that the burr rapidly diminishes after as few as ten impressions are printed.\n\nThere are three types of burrs that can be formed from machining operations: \"Poisson burr\", \"rollover burr\", and \"breakout burr\". The rollover burr is the most common. Burrs may be classified by the physical manner of formation. Plastic deformation of material includes lateral flow (Poisson burr), bending (rollover burr), and tearing of material from the workpiece (tear burr). Solidification or redeposition of material results in a recast bead. Incomplete cutoff of material causes a cutoff projection.\n\nBurrs can be minimized or prevented by considering materials, function, shape, and processing in the design and manufacturing engineering phases of product development.\n\nBurrs in drilled holes cause fastener and material problems. Burrs cause more stress to be concentrated at the edges of holes, decreasing resistance to fracture and shortening fatigue life. They interfere with the seating of fasteners, causing damage to fastener or the assembly itself. Cracks caused by stress and strain can result in material failure. Burrs in holes also increase the risk of corrosion, which may be due to variations in the thickness of coatings on a rougher surface. Sharp corners tend to concentrate electrical charge, increasing the risk of static discharge. Burrs in moving parts increase unwanted friction and heat. Rough surfaces also result in problems with lubrication, as wear is increased at the interfaces of parts. This makes it necessary to replace them more frequently. Electrical charge buildup can cause corrosion.\n\nThere are many deburring processes, but the most common are mass-finishing, spindle finishing, media blasting, sanding, grinding, wire brushing, abrasive flow machining, electrochemical deburring, electropolishing, thermal energy method, machining, and manual deburring.\n\n\"Manual deburring\" is the most common deburring process because it is the most flexible process. It also only requires low cost tools and allows for instant inspection.\nManual deburring is either done with tools like scrapers, files, sandpaper, stones and reamers or with handheld power tools that use abrasive points, sandpaper, or cutters similar to those used to deburr during machining.\n\n\"Electrochemical deburring\" is the use of electrochemical machining to deburr precision work pieces and edges that are hard-to-reach, such as intersecting holes. The process uses a salt or glycol solution and electricity to dissolve the burr. The electric current is applied with a specialized tool to reach the burr location. Burrs are removed in 5 to 10 seconds, while the rest of the work piece is unaffected.\n\n\"Thermal energy method\" (TEM), also known as \"thermal deburring\", is a deburring process used to remove hard-to-reach burrs or burrs from multiple surfaces at the same time. The process uses an explosive gas mixture to provide thermal energy to burn off the burrs. It is the fastest burr removal process, requiring only 20 milliseconds to remove a burr.\n\nThe process starts by loading the workpiece into an explosion-proof chamber, which is then sealed and clamped with approximately . The chamber is then evacuated of air and filled with an oxygen and fuel mix; this mixture is pressurized to . An electrical igniter then ignites the mixture, which burns for approximately 20 milliseconds, causing all of the sharp corners and burrs to burn away. The peak temperature reaches .\n\n\"Cryogenic deburring\" is a cryogenic process used to remove burrs and flash from plastic and die cast workpieces. The process works by tumbling and/or abrasively blasting the workpieces at cryogenic temperature levels. The low temperatures (approximately ) are achieved using liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide, or dry ice. This low temperature brings the material below its embrittlement temperature, which causes the flash or burrs to be easily removed via tumbling or media blasting. This process has been around since the 1960s to deflash plastic and rubber. Common materials that are typically cryogenically deburred with blast media include PEEK, nylon, Teflon, Delrin, polypropylene, polycarbonate, acetal, PTFE, PET, HDPE, PVC, ABS and many others.\n\n\"Mechanical deburring\" is a deburring process that either mechanically grinds a burr off of metal or rolls the edge of dangerous slit or sheared metal burrs into itself. Rolled mechanical deburring was first developed in the 1960s by Walter W. Gauer from Gauer Metal Product, Inc. as a means to speed up the process of hand deburring strips of metal that were used in bakery racks.\n\n\n"}

Shade trees normally have a dense canopy that blocks light from lower growing plants.\n\nCanopy structure is the organization or spatial arrangement (three-dimensional geometry) of a plant canopy.

The canopy layer provides protection from strong winds and storms, while also intercepting sunlight and precipitation, leading to a relatively sparsely vegetated understory layer.\n\nForest canopies are home to unique flora and fauna not found in other layers of forests. The highest terrestrial biodiversity resides in the canopy of tropical rainforests. Many rainforest animals have evolved to live solely in the canopy, and never touch the ground.\n\nThe canopy of a rainforest is typically about 10m thick, and intercepts around 95% of sunlight. The canopy is below the emergent layer, a sparse layer of very tall trees, typically one or two per hectare. With an abundance of water and a near ideal temperature in rainforests, light and nutrients are two factors that limit tree growth from the understory to the canopy.\n\nIn the permaculture and forest gardening community, the canopy is the highest of seven layers.\n\n\n\n"}

They are spoken in the 'Old Bavarian' regions of Upper Bavaria (with Munich), Lower Bavaria and in the adjacent parts of the Upper Palatinate region around Regensburg, in Upper and Lower Austria, in Vienna (see Viennese German), in the state of Salzburg, as well as in the northern and eastern parts of Styria and Burgenland.\n\nThere are noticeable differences in the language within the group, but changes occur along a west-east dialect continuum on both sides of the historic border of the Bavarian stem duchy with the later Duchy of Austria. That means that the distinct languages of Vienna and Munich are very different from each other, but the dialects of any two neighboring towns in between will be quite similar. However, due to influences of the corresponding political centers, discontinuous change is nowadays noticeable along the national border between Austria and Germany.\nGenerally, Viennese has some characteristics differentiating it from other Bavarian dialects due to the influence of languages spoken by people moving to Vienna from many areas of Austria-Hungary during the 19th century.\n\nA characteristic of Central Bavarian is the vocalization of \"l\" and \"r\" after \"e\" or \"i\". E.g. the standard German \"viel\" becomes either \"vui\" (in Western Central Bavarian) or \"vüü\" (in Eastern Central Bavarian).\nThe border between the western and eastern subgroups roughly coincides with the border between Bavaria and Austria. \n\nIn all subgroups, hard consonants such as \"p, t, k\" are softened to become \"b, d, g\".\n\n"}
{"id": "31550328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31550328", "title": "Constitutive role of communication in organizations", "text": "Constitutive role of communication in organizations\n\nThe communicative constitution of organizations (CCO) perspective is broadly characterized by the claim that communication is not something that happens within organizations or between organizational members; instead, communication is the process whereby organizations are constituted. Specifically, this view contends: “organization is an effect of communication not its predecessor.\" This perspective is part of a broader constitutive view of communication arguing, \"elements of communication, rather than being fixed in advance, are reflexively constituted within the act of communication itself\".\n\nThe model of communication as constitutive of organizations has origins in the linguistic approach to organizational communication taken in the 1980s. Theorists such as Karl E. Weick were among the first to posit that organizations were not static but inherently comprised by a dynamic process of communicating.\n\nThe notion of a communicative constitution of organization comprises three schools of thought: (1) The Montréal School, (2) the McPhee's Four Flows based on Gidden's Structuration Theory, and (3), Luhmann's Theory of Social Systems.\n\nIn their seminal 2000 article, which was republished in 2009 \"The Communicative Constitution of Organizations: A Framework for Explanation\", Robert D. McPhee and Pamela Zaug distinguish four types of communicative flows generate a social structure through interaction. The flows, though distinct, can affect one another in the model and lead to multi-way conversation or texts typically involving reproduction of as well as resistance to the rules and resources of the organization.\n\nReflexive self-structuring separates organizations from other groupings such as a crowd or mob. The self-structuring process is deliberately carried out through communication among role-holders and groups. Communication regarding self-structuring is recursive and dialogic in nature. It concerns the control, design, and documentation of an organization's relations, norms, processes, and entities. Communication of formal structure predetermines work routines rather than allowing them to emerge and controls the collaboration and membership-negotiation processes. Physical examples of organizational self-structuring include a charter, organizational chart, and policy manual.\n\nOrganizational self-structuring is a political, subjective process that can be affected by systems, individuals, interests, and traditions in which it takes place. It is not necessarily free of error or ambiguity. To constitute an organization, the communication must imply the formation and governance of a differentiated whole with its own reflexive response cycle and mechanisms.\n\nOrganizations are necessarily composed of, yet are distinct from, individual members. Because humans are not inherently members of organizations, negotiatory communication must occur to incorporate them. Membership negotiation links an organization to its members by establishing and maintaining relationships. Practices in membership negotiation include job recruitment and socialization. In recruitment, potential members are evaluated, both parties must agree to a relationship, and the member must be incorporated into the structure of the organization. The negotiation process can be influenced by powers including prior existence and supervision, and all parties involved may redefine themselves to fit expectations. Among higher status members, power-claiming and spokesmanship are examples of negotiation processes to gain resources of an organization.\n\nActivity coordination is a result of the fact that organizations inherently have at least one purpose to which the members' activity is contributing. Often an organization's self-structuring defines the division of labor, work flow sequences, policies, etc. that set the course for activity coordination. The structure is reflexively changing and may not be complete, relevant, fully understood, or free of problems. Therefore, a necessity of communication arises among members to amend and adjust the work process. Activity coordination can include adjusting the work process and resolving immediate or unforeseen practical problems.\n\nActivity coordination operates on the assumption that members are working in an interdependent social unit beyond the work tasks themselves. It incorporates any processes and attitudes and therefore includes coordination for members to not complete work or to seek power over one another. The work of Dr. Henry Mintzberg exemplifies activity coordination in the mechanism of mutual adjustment in his theory of organizational forms. In this example, co-workers informally coordinate work arounds for issues on the job.\n\nInstitutional positioning links the organization to the environment outside the organization at a macro level. Examples of entities outside the organization include suppliers, customers, and competitors. Communication outside the organization negotiates terms of recognition of the organization’s existence and place in what is called \"identity negotiation\" or \"positioning\". Often the communicators of this message are individuals who concurrently negotiate their own relationships but messages can come from the greater organization as a whole.\n\nThough there is not one configuration that an organization must embody, in order to be considered by peer institutions, the minimum process involves negotiating inclusion in the environment. Organizations must establish and maintain a presence, image, status, and a two-way communication channel with partners. Objects such as organizational charts can assert a particular image and demonstrate legitimacy. Organizations which are marginalized due to their lack of institutional positioning include startup companies and illegal groups such as the Mafia. Generally, the more secure an organization, the stronger relationships and control over uncertainty and resources it has in its environment. Pre-existing institutional (corporations, agencies), political, legal, cultural, etc. structures allow for easier constitution of complex organizations.\n\nOne of the most distinctive stances of the Montreal School approach, birthed in the Universite de Montreal by James Taylor, Francois Cooren (see particularly Cooren, 2004), and Bruno Latour amongst others, is that texts have agency. Texts do something to humans that is not reducible to certain human interactions and human actions.\n\nThe Montreal flavor of CCO is exemplified by Taylor et al. (1996) and the volume edited by Cooren, Taylor, and Van Emery (2006). The Montréal school foregrounds process of coorientation, or the orientation of two individuals to one another, and the object of conversation. Cooren, Kuhn, Cornelissen, and Clark (2011) suggest that coorientation occurs when individuals focus on each other and the multitudes of agencies within the organizational environment. Cooren et al. (2011), the current leading voice in the Montréal school, suggests that Greimas language theory (described by Cooren & Taylor, 2006 as almost incomprehensible) and Latour’s (1995, 2005) Actor Network Theory are the basis of the Montréal school’s thinking. Taylor and Van Every (2001) rely on Austin’s (1962) and Searle’s (1975) Speech Act Theory.\n\nTwo central terms to the Montréal school are derived from Austin’s work on language: text and conversation. The text represents big ‘D’ Discourse in the organization, or the way people talk, while conversation represents the messages exchanged between two parties that solidify into text. In this way, Taylor et al. (1996) claim that organizations are not real in the material sense; instead, organizations are a culmination of conversations and texts. Further, Taylor et al. (1996) suggest that organizations always speak through an agent. Over the course of time, distanciation, or solidification of various texts lead to what laypeople refer to as the organization, occurs.\n\nTaylor et al. (1996) propose several degrees of separation between text and conversation. First, text is translated into action through the ability of communication to carry intention. Second, conversation turns into a narrative representation as interlocutors agree on meaning. Third, text is translating into (semi)permanent medium; for example, we write down regulations in an employee handbook. Such medium permits storage of texts to help them become conversation. Fourth, these media specialize the language as professionalism. Fifth, physical and material structures are created by the organization to perpetuate conversation. Finally, publication, dissemination, diffusion, and other forms of broadcast are employed to convey the message created by members of the organization. Through this CCO process, the social arrangements of the workplace become codified. The Montréal school’s proponents contend that the essence of organizing is captured in the submission, imbrication, and embeddedness of text and conversation (Schoeneborn et al., 2014).\n\nSeveral other key terms are related with the Montréal school: coorientation (Taylor, 2009), plenum of agencies (Cooren, 2006), closure (Cooren & Fairhurst, 2004), hybridity (Castor & Cooren, 2006), imbrication (Taylor, 2011), and most recently ventriloquism (Cooren et al. 2013). Coorientation, as described above is an A-B-X relationship between two actors and an object; the object can be psychological, physical, or social. A plenum of agencies refers to the potential of both human and non-human actants (a term borrowed from Actor Network Theory; Latour, 1995) to interact within the organizational environment. Closure is the punctuation of conversations to provide deeper understanding by interlocutors. Hybridity refers to human and nonhuman actants working together to co-orient a claim. Imbrication refers to the emerging structures created by discourse in the organization over time that become an unquestioned part of what we call the organization. Finally, ventriloquism is the study of how interacts (both human and non-human) position and are positioned by the need to act via different values, principles, interests, norms, experiences, and other structures.\n\nLuhmann's systems theory focuses on three topics, which are interconnected in his entire work.\n\nThe core element of Luhmann's theory is communication. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society. A system is defined by a boundary between itself and its environment, dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. This process is also called \"reduction of complexity\". The criterion according to which information is selected and processed is meaning (in German, Sinn). Both social systems and psychical or personal systems (see below for an explanation of this distinction) operate by processing meaning.\n\nThe third strand of CCO was first acknowledged by Taylor (1995) but has only recently been included as a strand of CCO theorizing. Luhmann (1995) claims that individuals do not create meaning, instead all meaning comes from social systems. Perhaps this is why Luhmann’s general system perspective has only recently been considered a part of the CCO body of scholarship. Luhmann takes care to define communication as a tripartite conceptualization of interactive forces. Specifically, Seidl (2014) explains that Luhmann suggests communication is an amalgam of information, utterance, and understanding. Whereas information is what is contained in a message, utterance is how the communication is conducted, and understanding “refers to the distinction between information and utterance” (p. 290). Luhmann’s perspective is a radical departure from traditional communication scholarship. Putnam and Fairhurst (2015) explain that the Luhmannian perspective is wholly communicative; that is, meaning is complete up to utterances in a given communicative interaction.\n\nLuhmann’s perspective gives less value to human agency in favor of a social agentic perspective. For this reason, Seidl claims that CCO research using Luhmann’s version should focus on communication not on actors. Human agency is minimized by this perspective. Psychic systems (i.e., the mind) interact with social systems (i.e., an organic conglomerate of multiple psychic systems) and human actors are not relevant to the constitution of organizations. \n\n"}

The practice is sometimes called firescaping. \"Defensible space\" is also used in the context of wildfires, especially in the wildland-urban interface (WUI). This defensible space reduces the risk that fire will spread from one area to another, or to a structure, and provides firefighters access and a safer area from which to defend a threatened area. Firefighters sometimes do not attempt to protect structures without adequate defensible space, as it is less safe and less likely to succeed.\n\n\nThe term defensible space in landscape (\"firescape\") use refers to the zone surrounding a structure. Often the location is in the wildland–urban interface. This area need not be devoid of vegetation by using naturally fire resistive plants that are spaced, pruned and trimmed, and irrigated, to minimize the fuel mass available to ignite and also to hamper the spread of a fire.\n\n\nAn important component is ongoing maintenance of the fire-resistant landscaping for reduced fuel loads and fire fighting access. Fire resistive plants that are not maintained can desiccate, die, or amass deadwood debris, and become fire assistive. Irrigation systems and pruning can help maintain a plant's fire resistance. Maintaining access roads and driveways clear of side and low-hanging vegetation can allow large fire equipment to reach properties and structures.\nSome agencies recommend clearing combustible vegetation at minimum horizontal 10 ft from roads and driveways a vertical of 13 ft 6 inches above them. Considering the plant material involved is important to not create unintended consequences to habitat integrity and unnecessary aesthetic issues. Street signs, and homes clearly identified with the numerical address, assist access also.\n\nThe unintended negative consequences of erosion and native habitat loss can result from some unskillful defensible space applications. The disturbance of the soil surface, such as garden soil cultivation in and firebreaks beyond native landscape zones areas, destroys the native plant cover and exposes open soil, accelerating invasive species of plants (\"invasive exotics\") spreading and replacing native habitats.\n\nIn suburban and wildland–urban interface areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for defensible space can result in mistaken excessive clearcutting of native and non-invasive introduced shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species, and also to erosion and landslides. Negative aesthetic consequences to natural and landscaped areas can be minimized with integrated and balanced defensible space practices.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "827837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=827837", "title": "Ecosystem engineer", "text": "Ecosystem engineer\n\nAn ecosystem engineer is any organism that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a habitat. These organisms can have a large impact on the species richness and landscape-level heterogeneity of an area. As a result, ecosystem engineers are important for maintaining the health and stability of the environment they are living in. Since all organisms impact the environment they live in in one way or another, it has been proposed that the term \"ecosystem engineers\" be used only for keystone species whose behavior very strongly affects other organisms.\n\nJones et al. identified two different types of ecosystem engineers:\n\nAllogenic engineers modify the environment (biophysical) by mechanically changing living or nonliving materials from one form to another. Beavers are the original model for ecosystem engineers; in the process of clearcutting and damming, beavers alter their ecosystem extensively. The addition of a dam will change both the distribution and the abundance of many organisms in the area. Caterpillars are another example in that by creating shelters from leaves, they are also creating shelters for other organisms which may occupy them either simultaneously or subsequently. An additional example may be that of woodpeckers or other birds who create holes in trees for them to nest in. Once these birds are through with them, the holes are used by other species of birds or mammals for housing.\n\nAutogenic engineers modify the environment by modifying themselves. Trees are a good example, because as they grow, their trunks and branches create habitats for other living things; these may include squirrels, birds or insects among others. In the tropics, lianas connect trees, which allow many animals to travel exclusively through the forest canopy.\n\nBeing able to identify ecosystem engineers in an environment can be important when looking at the influence these individuals may have over other organisms living in the same environment – especially in terms of resource availability.\n\nThe presence of some ecosystem engineers has been linked to higher species richness at the landscape level. By modifying the habitat, organisms like the beaver create more habitat heterogeneity and so can support species not found elsewhere. Thoughts may be that similar to other umbrella species by conserving an ecosystem engineer you may be able to protect the overall diversity of a landscape. Beavers have also been shown to maintain habitats in such a way as to protect the rare Saint Francis' satyr butterfly and increase plant diversity.\n\nBiodiversity may also be affected by ecosystem engineer's ability to increase the complexity of processes within an ecosystem, potentially allowing greater species richness and diversity in the local environments. As an example, beavers have the capacity to modify riparian forest and expand wetland habitats, which results in an increase of the diversity of the habitats by allowing a greater number of species to inhabit the landscape. Coral-reef habitats, created by the ecosystem engineer coral species, hold some of the highest abundances of aquatic species in the world.\n\nSpecies are able to be transported across all parts of the world by humans or human-made vessels at boundless rates resulting in foreign ecosystem engineers changing the dynamics of species interactions and the possibility for engineering to occur in locations that would not have been accessible by engineers without the mediation by humans.\n\nIntroduced species, which may be invasive species, are often ecosystem engineers. Kudzu, a leguminous plant introduced to the southeast U.S., changes the distribution and number of animal and bird species in the areas it invades. It also crowds out native plant species. The zebra mussel is an ecosystem engineer in North America. By providing refuge from predators, it encourages the growth of freshwater invertebrates through increasing microhabitats. Light penetration into infected lakes also improves the ecosystem, resulting in an increase in algae. In contrast to the benefits some ecosystem engineers can cause, invasive species often have the reverse effect.\n\nHumans are thought to be one of the most dramatic ecosystem engineers. Niche construction has been prevalent since the earliest days of human activity. Through urban development, agricultural practices, logging, damming and mining, humans have changed the way they interact with the environment. \nThis interaction is more studied in the field of human ecology.\n\nDue to the complexity of many communities and ecosystems, restoration projects are often difficult. Ecosystem engineers have been proposed as a means to restore a given area to its previous state. While ideally these would all be natural agents, with today's level of development some form of human intervention may be necessary as well. In addition to being able to assist in restoration ecology, ecosystem engineers may be a helpful agent in invasive species management. New fields are developing which focus on restoring those ecosystems which have been disrupted or destroyed by human activities as well as developing ecosystems that are sustainable with both human and ecological values.\n\nBesides the previously mentioned beaver acting as an ecosystem engineer, other terrestrial animals do the same. This may be through feeding habits, migration patterns or other behaviors that result in more permanent changes.\n\nResearch has suggested primates as ecosystem engineers as a result of their feeding strategies – frugivory and folivory – making them act as seed dispersers. As a whole primates are very abundant and feed on a large quantity of fruit that is then distributed around their territory. Elephants have also been designated ecosystem engineers as they cause very large changes to their environment whether it be through feeding, digging or migratory behavior.\n\nNot only animals are ecosystem engineers. Fungi are able to connect regions that are distant from one another and translocate nutrients between them. Doing so they create nutritional niches for xylophagous invertebrates, supply trees with N translocated from previously predated animals or even form an \"underground pipeline\" that redistributes carbon between trees. Thus fungi are engineers controlling nutrient cycles in ecosystems.\n\nPrairie dogs are another terrestrial form of allogenic ecosystem engineers due to the fact that the species has the ability to perform substantial modifications by burrowing and turning soil. They are able to influence soils and vegetation of the landscape while providing underground corridors for arthropods, avians, other small mammals, and reptiles. This has a positive effect on species richness and diversity of their habitats which results in the prairie dogs being labelled as keystone species.\n\nIn marine environments, filter feeders and plankton are ecosystem engineers because they alter turbidity and light penetration, controlling the depth at which photosynthesis can occur. This in turn limits the primary productivity of benthic and pelagic habitats and influences consumption patterns between trophic groups.\n\nAnother example of ecosystem engineers in marine environments would be scleractinian corals as they create the framework for the habitat most coral-reef organisms depend on. Some ecosystem engineers such as coral have help maintaining their environment. Parrotfish often help maintain coral reefs as they feed on macroalgae that competes with the coral. As this relationship is mutually beneficial, a positive feedback cycle is formed between the two organisms, making them both responsible for creating and maintaining coral reef ecosystems.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "393020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=393020", "title": "Eve teasing", "text": "Eve teasing\n\nEve teasing is a euphemism used throughout South Asia, which includes (but is not limited to) India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal, for public sexual harassment or sexual assault of women by men, the name \"Eve\" alluding to the very first woman, according to the Biblical creation story. Considered a problem related to delinquency in youth, it is a form of sexual aggression that ranges in severity from sexually suggestive remarks, brushing in public places and catcalls, to groping. The Indian National Commission for Women has suggested that the expression be replaced by a more appropriate term. According to them, considering the semantic roots of the term in Indian English, Eve teasing refers to the temptress nature of Eve, placing responsibility on the woman as a tease. Teasing the girls, passing comment on them, harassing them, troubling them purposely is called 'eve teasing.'\n\nSexual harassment by strangers, as with any type of harassment, has been a notoriously difficult crime to prove, as perpetrators often devise discreet ways to harass women, although Eve teasing usually occurs in public spaces and streets and on public transport. Some guidebooks to the region warn female tourists to avoid attracting the attention of these kinds of men by wearing conservative clothing. However, this harassment is reported both by Indian women and by conservatively dressed foreign women.\n\nThe problem first received public and media attention in the 1970s. In the following decades, more and more women started attending college and working independently, meaning that they were often no longer accompanied by a male escort as had been the norm in traditional society. In response, the problem grew to alarming proportions, despite this not being the case in other cultures where women go and come as they please. Soon the Indian government had to take remedial measures, both judicial and law enforcement, to curb the practice. Efforts were made to sensitise the police about the issue, and police started to round up Eve teasers. The deployment of plain-clothed female police officers for the purpose has been particularly effective. Other measures taken in various states by the police were setting up of dedicated women's helplines in various cities, police stations staffed by women, and special police cells.\n\nAlso seen during this period was a marked rise in the number of women coming forward to report cases of sexual harassment, due to changing public opinion against this practice. In addition, the severity of these incidents grew as well, in some cases leading to acid throwing, which in turn led to states like Tamil Nadu making it a non-bailable offense. The number of women's organisations and those working for women's rights also increased, and during this period reports of bride burning increased. The increase in the number of violent incidents involving women meant previously lackadaisical attitudes towards women's rights had to be revised and supported by law. In the coming years, certain organisations played a key role in lobbying for the passing of legislation designed to protect women from aggressive behaviour from strangers, including 'The Delhi Prohibition of Eve-teasing Bill 1984'.\n\nThe death of a female student, Sarika Shah, in Chennai in 1998, resulted in some tough laws to counter the problem in South India. After murder charges were brought, about a half-dozen reports of suicide have been attributed to pressures caused by this behaviour. In February 2009, female students from Maharaja Sayajirao University (MSU) in Vadodara assaulted four young men near the family and community sciences faculty, after the men made lewd comments about a girl student staying in SD Hall hostel.\n\nMany other cases go unreported for fear of reprisals and exposure to public shame. In some cases police let the offenders go, after public humiliation through the murga punishment. In 2008, a Delhi court ordered a 19-year-old youth caught making lewd remarks to passing females to distribute 500 handbills to youngsters outside schools and colleges detailing the consequences of indecent conduct.\n\nSome depictions in Indian cinema shows mild teasing as a part of flirtatious beginnings of a courtship, along with the usual accompaniment of song and dance routines, which invariably results in the heroine submitting to the hero's advances towards the end of the song. Young men tend to emulate the example depicted so flawlessly on screen; the term \"roadside Romeos\" even made it to film in \"Roadside Romeo\" (2007).\n\nIt also has been popularly depicted that when a girl is teased in this way, the hero will come and beat the guy up, such as in the Telugu films \"Madhumasam\", \"Magadheera\"and Eega. and also the Hindi film \"Wanted\". Nowadays, this issue is also featured in Indian television soaps like \"Savdhaan India\" and \"Crime Patrol\".\n\nAlthough Indian law doesn't use the term \"Eve teasing\", victims earlier usually seek recourse through Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code, which sentences a man found guilty of making a girl or woman the target of obscene gestures, remarks, songs or recitation to a maximum jail sentence of three months. Section 292 of the IPC clearly spells out that showing pornographic or obscene pictures, books or papers to a woman or girl results in a fine of with two years' imprisonment for first offenders. In the case of a repeated offense, the offender may have a fine of with five years' imprisonment imposed. Under Section 509 of the IPC, obscene gestures, indecent body language and negative comments directed at any woman or girl or exhibiting any object which intrudes upon the privacy of a woman, carries a penalty of imprisonment for one year or a fine or both. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 introduced changes to the Indian Penal Code, making sexual harassment an expressed offence under Section 354 A, which is punishable up to three years of imprisonment and or with fine. The Amendment also introduced new sections making acts like disrobing a woman without consent, stalking and sexual acts by person in authority an offense.\n\nThe National Commission for Women (NCW) also proposed No 9. Eve Teasing (New Legislation) 1988. The Indian Parliament has passed the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, which add protections for female workers in most workplaces. The Act came into force from 9 December 2013.\n\n\"Nirbhaya Karnataka\" (\"Fearless Karnataka\") is a coalition of many individuals and groups including Alternative Law Forum, Blank Noise, Maraa, Samvada and Vimochana. After the rise of eve teasing cases in the 2000s, it organised several public awareness campaigns, including Take Back the Night, followed by another public art project titled, The Blank Noise Project, starting in Bangalore in 2003. A similar program to fight eve-teasing was also hosted in Mumbai in 2008.\n\nIn Delhi, one of India's most dangerous cities for women, the Department of Women and Child Development established a steering committee in 2009 to prepare the city for the Commonwealth Games to be held in 2010. In Mumbai, \"Ladies Special\" train compartments have been introduced to allow women to travel without the fear of being sexually harassed, for the length of the journey at least. Given that the number of women needing to travel has doubled since 1995, there is a very strong demand for these kinds of services. Today \"Ladies Special\" compartments are present in most local trains in big cities. The Delhi Metro also has exclusive women-only cars.\n\nEve teasing is highly criticised by the media and on social media websites such as Facebook.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "523166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=523166", "title": "Free monoid", "text": "Free monoid\n\nIn abstract algebra, the free monoid on a set is the monoid whose elements are all the finite sequences (or strings) of zero or more elements from that set, with string concatenation as the monoid operation and with the unique sequence of zero elements, often called the empty string and denoted by ε or λ, as the identity element. The free monoid on a set \"A\" is usually denoted \"A\". The free semigroup on \"A\" is the subsemigroup of \"A\" containing all elements except the empty string. It is usually denoted \"A\".\n\nMore generally, an abstract monoid (or semigroup) \"S\" is described as free if it is isomorphic to the free monoid (or semigroup) on some set.\n\nAs the name implies, free monoids and semigroups are those objects which satisfy the usual universal property defining free objects, in the respective categories of monoids and semigroups. It follows that every monoid (or semigroup) arises as a homomorphic image of a free monoid (or semigroup). The study of semigroups as images of free semigroups is called combinatorial semigroup theory.\n\nThe monoid (N,+) of natural numbers (including zero) under addition is a free monoid on a singleton free generator, in this case the natural number 1. \nAccording to the formal definition, this monoid consists of all sequences like \"1\", \"1+1\", \"1+1+1\", \"1+1+1+1\", and so on, including the empty sequence. \nMapping each such sequence to its evaluation result\n\nand the empty sequence to zero establishes an isomorphism from the set of such sequences to N.\nThis isomorphism is compatible with \"+\", that is, for any two sequences \"s\" and \"t\", if \"s\" is mapped (i.e. evaluated) to a number \"m\" and \"t\" to \"n\", then their concatenation \"s\"+\"t\" is mapped to the sum \"m\"+\"n\".\n\nIn formal language theory, usually a finite set of \"symbols\" A (sometimes called the alphabet) is considered. A finite sequence of symbols is called \"word over \"A\"\", and the free monoid \"A\" is called the \"Kleene star of \"A\"\".\nThus, the abstract study of formal languages can be thought of as the study of subsets of finitely generated free monoids. There are deep connections between the theory of semigroups and that of automata. For example, the regular languages over \"A\" are the homomorphic pre-images in \"A\" of subsets of finite monoids.\n\nFor example, assuming an alphabet \"A\" = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}, its Kleene star \"A\" contains all concatenations of \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\":\n\nIf \"A\" is any set, the \"word length\" function on \"A\" is the unique monoid homomorphism from \"A\" to (N,+) that maps each element of \"A\" to 1. A free monoid is thus a graded monoid.\n\nMore generally, the regular languages over an alphabet A are the closure of the finite subsets of A*, the free monoid over A, under union, product, and generation of submonoid. \n\nWe define a pair of words in \"A\" of the form \"uv\" and \"vu\" as conjugate: the conjugates of a word are thus its circular shifts. Two words are conjugate in this sense if they are conjugate in the sense of group theory as elements of the free group generated by \"A\".\n\nA free monoid is equidivisible: if the equation \"mn\" = \"pq\" holds, then there exists an \"s\" such that either \"m\" = \"ps\", \"sn\" = \"q\" (example see image) or \"ms\" = \"p\", \"n\" = \"sq\". This result is also known as Levi's lemma.\n\nA monoid is free if and only if it is graded and equidivisible.\n\nThe members of a set \"A\" are called the free generators for \"A\" and \"A\". The superscript * is then commonly understood to be the Kleene star. More generally, if \"S\" is an abstract free monoid (semigroup), then a set of elements which maps onto the set of single-letter words under an isomorphism to a semigroup \"A\" (monoid \"A\") is called a \"set of free generators\" for \"S\".\n\nEach free semigroup (or monoid) \"S\" has exactly one set of free generators, the cardinality of which is called the \"rank\" of \"S\".\n\nTwo free monoids or semigroups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same rank. In fact, \"every\" set of generators for a free semigroup or monoid \"S\" contains the free generators (see definition of generators in Monoid) since a free generator has word length 1 and hence can only be generated by itself. It follows that a free semigroup or monoid is finitely generated if and only if it has finite rank.\n\nA submonoid \"N\" of \"A\" is stable if \"u\", \"v\", \"ux\", \"xv\" in \"N\" together imply \"x\" in \"N\". A submonoid of \"A\" is stable if and only if it is free.\nFor example, using the set of bits { \"0\", \"1\" } as \"A\", the set \"N\" of all bit strings containing evenly many \"1\"s is a stable submonoid because if \"u\" contains an even number of \"1\"s, and \"ux\" as well, then \"x\" must contain an even number of \"1\"s, too. While \"N\" cannot be freely generated by any set of single bits, it \"can\" be freely generated by the set of bit strings { \"0\", \"11\", \"101\", \"1001\", \"10001\", ... }.\n\nA set of free generators for a free monoid \"P\" is referred to as a basis for P: a set of words \"C\" is a code if \"C\"* is a free monoid and \"C\" is a basis. A set \"X\" of words in \"A\" is a prefix, or has the prefix property, if it does not contain a proper (string) prefix of any of its elements. Every prefix in \"A\" is a code, indeed a prefix code.\n\nA submonoid \"N\" of \"A\" is right unitary if \"x\", \"xy\" in \"N\" implies \"y\" in \"N\". A submonoid is generated by a prefix if and only if it is right unitary.\n\nThe intersection of free submonoids of a free monoid \"A\" is again free. If \"S\" is a subset of a free monoid \"A\"* then the intersection of all free submonoids of \"A\"* containing \"S\" is well-defined, since \"A\"* itself is free, and contains \"S\"; it is a free monoid. A basis for this intersection is the free hull of \"S\".\n\nThe defect theorem states that if \"X\" is finite and \"C\" is the free hull of \"X\", then either \"X\" is a code and \"C\" = \"X\", or\n\nA monoid morphism \"f\" from a free monoid \"B\" to a monoid \"M\" is a map such that \"f\"(\"xy\") = \"f\"(\"x\")⋅\"f\"(\"y\") for words \"x\",\"y\" and \"f\"(ε) = ι, where ε and ι denotes the identity element of \"B\" and \"M\", respectively. The morphism \"f\" is determined by its values on the letters of \"B\" and conversely any map from \"B\" to \"M\" extends to a morphism. A morphism is non-erasing or continuous if no letter of \"B\" maps to ι and trivial if every letter of \"B\" maps to ι.\n\nA morphism \"f\" from a free monoid \"B\" to a free monoid \"A\" is total if every letter of \"A\" occurs in some word in the image of \"f\"; cyclic or periodic if the image of \"f\" is contained in {\"w\"} for some word \"w\" of \"A\". A morphism \"f\" is \"k\"-uniform if the length |\"f\"(\"a\")| is constant and equal to \"k\" for all \"a\" in \"A\". A 1-uniform morphism is strictly alphabetic or a coding.\n\nA morphism \"f\" from a free monoid \"B\" to a free monoid \"A\" is simplifiable if there is an alphabet \"C\" of cardinality less than that of \"B\" such the morphism \"f\" factors through \"C\", that is, it is the composition of a morphism from \"B\" to \"C\" and a morphism from that to \"A\"; otherwise \"f\" is elementary. The morphism \"f\" is called a code if the image of the alphabet \"B\" under \"f\" is a code: every elementary morphism is a code.\n\nFor \"L\" a subset of \"B\", a finite subset \"T\" of \"L\" is a \"test set\" for \"L\" if morphisms \"f\" and \"g\" on \"B\" agree on \"L\" if and only if they agree on \"T\". The Ehrenfeucht conjecture is that any subset \"L\" has a test set: it has been proved independently by Albert and Lawrence; McNaughton; and Guba. The proofs rely on Hilbert's basis theorem.\n\nAn endomorphism of \"A\" is a morphism from \"A\" to itself. The identity map \"I\" is an endomorphism of \"A\", and the endomorphisms form a monoid under composition of functions.\n\nAn endomorphism \"f\" is prolongable if there is a letter \"a\" such that \"f\"(\"a\") = \"as\" for a non-empty string \"s\".\n\nThe operation of string projection is an endomorphism. That is, given a letter \"a\" ∈ Σ and a string \"s\" ∈ Σ, the string projection \"p\"(\"s\") removes every occurrence of \"a\" from \"s\"; it is formally defined by\n\nNote that string projection is well-defined even if the rank of the monoid is infinite, as the above recursive definition works for all strings of finite length. String projection is a morphism in the category of free monoids, so that\n\nwhere formula_3 is understood to be the free monoid of all finite strings that don't contain the letter \"a\". The identity morphism is formula_4, as clearly formula_5 for all strings \"s\". Of course, it commutes with the operation of string concatenation, so that formula_6 for all strings \"s\" and \"t\". There are many right inverses to string projection, and thus it is a split epimorphism.\n\nString projection is commutative, as clearly\n\nFor free monoids of finite rank, this follows from the fact that free monoids of the same rank are isomorphic, as projection reduces the rank of the monoid by one.\n\nString projection is idempotent, as\n\nfor all strings \"s\". Thus, projection is an idempotent, commutative operation, and so it forms a bounded semilattice or a commutative band.\n\nAn endomorphism of the free monoid \"B\" on a 2-letter alphabet \"B\" is Sturmian if it maps every Sturmian word to a Sturmian word and locally Sturmian if it maps some Sturmian word to a Sturmian word. The Sturmian endomorphisms form a submonoid of the monoid of endomorphisms of \"B\".\n\nDefine endomorphisms φ and ψ of \"B\", where \"B\" = {0,1}, by φ(0) = 01, φ(1) = 0 and ψ(0) = 10, ψ(1) = 0. Then \"I\", φ and ψ are Sturmian, and the Sturmian endomorphisms of \"B\" are precisely those endomorphisms in the submonoid of the endomorphism monoid generated by {\"I\",φ,ψ}.\n\nA primitive substitution is Sturmian if the image of the word 10010010100101 is balanced.\n\nGiven a set \"A\", the free commutative monoid on \"A\" is the set of all finite multisets with elements drawn from \"A\", with the monoid operation being multiset sum and the monoid unit being the empty multiset.\n\nFor example, if \"A\" = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}, elements of the free commutative monoid on \"A\" are of the form\n\nThe fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that the monoid of positive integers under multiplication is a free commutative monoid on an infinite set of generators, the prime numbers.\n\nThe free commutative semigroup is the subset of the free commutative monoid which contains all multisets with elements drawn from \"A\" except the empty multiset.\n\nThe free partially commutative monoid, or \"trace monoid\", is a generalization that encompasses both the free and free commutative monoids as instances. This generalization finds applications in combinatorics and in the study of parallelism in computer science.\n\nThe free monoid on a set \"A\" corresponds to lists of elements from \"A\" with concatenation as the binary operation. A monoid homomorphism from the free monoid to any other monoid (\"M\",•) is a function \"f\" such that\nwhere \"e\" is the identity on \"M\". Computationally, every such homomorphism corresponds to a map operation applying \"f\" to all the elements of a list, followed by a fold operation which combines the results using the binary operator •. This computational paradigm (which can be generalised to non-associative binary operators) has inspired the MapReduce software framework.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5575722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5575722", "title": "Fuck", "text": "Fuck\n\nFuck is an obscene English-language word which often refers to the act of sexual intercourse but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to denote disdain. While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475. In modern usage, the term \"fuck\" and its derivatives (such as \"fucker\" and \"fucking\") can be used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an interjection or an adverb. There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as \"motherfucker,\" \"fuckwit\" and \"fucknut\".\n\nThe word is considered obscene but is common in many informal and familiar situations.\n\nIt is unclear whether the word has always been considered vulgar or, if not, when it first came to be used to describe (often in an extremely angry, hostile or belligerent manner) unpleasant circumstances or people in an intentionally offensive way, such as in the term \"motherfucker\", one of its more common usages in some parts of the English-speaking world. Some English-speaking countries censor it on television and radio. Andrea Millwood Hargrave's 2000 study of the attitudes of the British public found that \"fuck\" was considered the third-most severe profanity and its derivative \"motherfucker\" second. \"Cunt\" was considered the most severe.\n\nNevertheless, the word has become increasingly less vulgar and more publicly acceptable, an example of the \"dysphemism treadmill\", wherein former vulgarities become inoffensive and commonplace. According to linguist Pamela Hobbs, \"notwithstanding its increasing public use, enduring cultural models that inform our beliefs about the nature of sexuality and sexual acts preserve its status as a vile utterance that continues to inspire moral outrage.\" Hobbs considers \"users\" rather than \"usage\" of the word and sub-divides \"users\" into 'non-users', for whom the word \"evokes the core sexual meanings and associated sexual imagery that motivate the taboo\", and 'users' for whom \"metaphorical uses of the word \"fuck\" no more evoke images of sexual intercourse than a ten-year-old’s ‘My mom’ll kill me if she finds out’ evokes images of murder,\" so that the \"criteria of taboo are missing.\"\n\nBecause of its increasing usage in the public forum, in 2005 the word was included for the first time as one of three vulgarities in The Canadian Press's \"Canadian Press Caps and Spelling\" guide. Journalists were advised to refrain from censoring the word but use it sparingly and only when its inclusion was essential to the story.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" states that the ultimate etymology is uncertain, but that the word is \"probably cognate\" with a number of Germanic words with meanings involving striking, rubbing and having sex or is derivative of the Old French word that meant \"to fuck.\"\n\nThe word has probable cognates in other Germanic languages, such as German \"ficken\" (to fuck); Dutch \"fokken\" (to breed, to beget); dialectal Norwegian \"fukka\" (to copulate), and dialectal Swedish \"focka\" (to strike, to copulate) and \"fock\" (penis). This points to a possible etymology where Common Germanic \"fuk-\" comes from an Indo-European root meaning \"to strike\", cognate with non-Germanic words such as Latin \"pugno\" \"I fight\" or \"pugnus\" \"fist\". By application of Grimm's law, this hypothetical root has the form *\"pug–\". There is a theory that \"fuck\" is most likely derived from Flemish, German, or Dutch roots, and is probably not derived from an Old English root.\n\nThere may be a kinship with the Latin \"futuere\" (\"futuo\"), a verb with almost exactly the same meaning as the English verb \"to fuck\". From \"fūtuere\" came French \"foutre\", Catalan \"fotre\", Italian \"fottere\", Romanian \"futere\", vulgar peninsular Spanish \"joder\", Portuguese \"foder\", and the obscure English equivalent \"to futter\", coined by Richard Francis Burton. However, there is no clear past lineage or derivation for the Latin word. These roots, even if cognates, are not the original Indo-European word for \"to copulate\", but Wayland Young argues that they derive from the Indo-European *\"bu–\" or *\"bug–\" (\"be\", \"become\"), or as causative \"create\" [see Young, 1964]. A possible intermediate might be a Latin 4th-declension verbal noun *\"fūtus\", with possible meanings including \"act of (pro)creating\".\n\nHowever, the connection to \"futuere\" has been disputedAnatoly Liberman calls it a \"coincidence\" and writes that it is not likely to have been borrowed from the Low German precursors to \"fuck\".\n\nGreek \"phyō\" (φύω) has various meanings, including (of a man) \"to beget\", or (of a woman), \"to give birth to\". Its perfect \"pephyka\" (πέφυκα) can be likened to \"fuck\" and its equivalents in other Germanic languages.\n\nOne reason that the word \"fuck\" is so hard to trace etymologically is that it was used far more extensively in common speech than in easily traceable written forms. There are several urban-legend false etymologies postulating an acronymic origin for the word. None of these acronyms were ever recorded before the 1960s, according to the authoritative lexicographical work \"The F-Word\", and thus are backronyms. In any event, the word \"fuck\" has been in use far too long for some of these supposed origins to be possible. Some of these urban legends are that the word \"fuck\" came from Irish law. If a couple were caught committing adultery, they would be punished \"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge In the Nude,\" with \"FUCKIN\" written on the stocks above them to denote the crime. A similar variant on this theory involves the recording by church clerks of the crime of \"Forbidden Use of Carnal Knowledge.\" Another theory is that of a royal permission. During the Black Death in the Middle Ages, towns were trying to control populations and their interactions. Since uncontaminated resources were scarce, supposedly many towns required permission to have children. Hence, the legend goes, that couples that were having children were required to first obtain royal permission (usually from a local magistrate or lord) and then place a sign somewhere visible from the road in their home that said \"Fornicating Under Consent of King,\" which was later shortened to \"FUCK.\" This story is hard to document, but has persisted in oral and literary traditions for many years; however, it has been demonstrated to be an urban legend.\n\nA different false etymology, first made popular on the radio show \"Car Talk\", states that the phrase \"fuck you\" comes from the phrase \"pluck yew\" and relates the origins of \"fuck\" to the myth surrounding the V sign. This myth states that French archers at the Battle of Agincourt insulted the English troops' ability to shoot their weapons by waving their fingers in a V shape; after the English secured an overwhelming victory, they returned the gesture. The addition of the phrase \"fuck you\" to the myth came when it was claimed that the English yelled that they could still \"pluck yew\" (yew wood being the preferred material for longbows at the time), a phrase that evolved into the modern \"fuck you\".\n\n\"Fuck\" has a very flexible role in English grammar, including use as both a transitive and intransitive verb, and as an adjective, adverb, and noun. It can also be used as an interjection and a grammatical ejaculation. Linguist Geoffrey Hughes found eight distinct usages for English curse words, and \"fuck\" can apply to each. For example, it fits in the \"curse\" sense (\"fuck you!\") as well as the \"personal\" sense (\"You fucker\"). Its vulgarity also contributes to its mostly figurative sense, though the word itself is used in its literal sense to refer to sexual intercourse, its most common usage is figurative—to indicate the speaker's strong sentiment and to offend or shock the listener.\n\nIn 2015, Dr. Paul Booth claimed to have found \"(possibly) the earliest known use of the word 'fuck' that clearly has a sexual connotation\": in English court records of 1310–11, a man local to Chester is referred to as \"Roger Fuckebythenavele\", probably a nickname. \"Either this refers to an inexperienced copulator, referring to someone trying to have sex with the navel, or it's a rather extravagant explanation for a dimwit, someone so stupid they think that this is the way to have sex,\" says Booth. An earlier name, that of John le Fucker recorded in 1278, has been the subject of debate, but is thought by many philologists to have had some separate and non-sexual origin.\n\nOtherwise, the usually accepted first known occurrence of the word is found in code in a poem in a mixture of Latin and English composed in the 15th century. The poem, which satirizes the Carmelite friars of Cambridge, England, takes its title, \"Flen flyys\", from the first words of its opening line, \"Flen, flyys, and freris\" (\"Fleas, flies, and friars\"). The line that contains \"fuck\" reads \"Non sunt in coeli, quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk\". Deciphering the phrase \"gxddbou xxkxzt pg ifmk\", here by replacing each letter by the previous letter in alphabetical order, as the English alphabet was then, yields the macaronic \"non sunt in coeli, quia fuccant vvivys of heli\", which translated means, \"They are not in heaven, because they fuck the women of Ely\". The phrase was probably encoded because it accused monks of breaking their vows of celibacy; it is uncertain to what extent the word \"fuck\" was considered acceptable at the time. The stem of \"fuccant\" is an English word used as Latin: English medieval Latin has many examples of writers using English words when they did not know the Latin word: \"workmannus\" is an example. In the Middle English of this poem, the term \"wife\" was still used generically for \"woman\".\n\nWilliam Dunbar's 1503 poem \"Brash of Wowing\" includes the lines: \"Yit be his feiris he wald haue fukkit: / Ye brek my hairt, my bony ane\" (ll. 13–14).\n\nThe oldest occurrence of the word in adjectival form (which implies use of the verb) in English comes from the margins of a 1528 manuscript copy of Cicero's \"De Officiis\". A monk had scrawled in the margin notes, \"fuckin Abbot.\" Whether the monk meant the word literally, to accuse this abbott of \"questionable monastic morals,\" or whether he used it \"as an intensifier, to convey his extreme dismay\" is unclear.\n\nJohn Florio's 1598 Italian-English dictionary, \"A Worlde of Wordes\", included the term, along with several now-archaic, but then-vulgar synonyms, in this definition:\nOf these, \"occupy\" and \"jape\" still survive as verbs, though with less profane meanings, while \"sard\" was a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon verb \"seordan\" (or \"seorðan\", ON \"serða\"), to copulate; and \"swive\" had derived from earlier \"swīfan\", to revolve i.e. to swivel (compare modern-day \"screw\"). As late as the 18th century, the verb \"occupy\" was seldom used in print because it carried sexual overtones.\n\nA 1790 poem by George Tucker has a father upset with his bookish son say \"I'd not give [a fuck] for all you've read\". Originally printed as \"I'd not give ------ for all you've read\", scholars agree that the words \"a fuck\" were removed, making the poem the first recorded instance of the now-common phrase \"I don't give a fuck\".\n\nFarmer and Henley's 1893 dictionary of slang notes both the adverbial and adjectival forms of \"fuck\" as similar to but \"more violent\" than \"bloody\" and indicating extreme insult, respectively.\n\nThough it appeared in English lexicographer John Ash's 1775 \"A New and Complete Dictionary\", listed as \"low\" and \"vulgar,\" and appearing with several definitions, \"fuck\" did not appear in any widely consulted dictionary of the English language from 1795 to 1965. Its first appearance in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (along with the word \"cunt\") was in 1972.\n\nThe variant \"feck\" appeared in the \"English Dialect Dictionary\", compiled by Joseph Wright in 1900.\n\nThe modern usage and flexibility of \"fuck\" was established by the mid to late 19th century, and has been fairly stable since. Most literally, to \"fuck\" is to copulate, but it is also used as a more general expletive or intensifier. Some instances of the word can be taken at face value, such as \"Let's fuck,\" \"I would fuck her/him,\" or \"He/she fucks.\" Other uses connotations that are offensive either about the subject matter or to the audience, or to both: The sexual connotation, usually connected to masturbation (in the case of \"go fuck yourself\" or \"go fuck yourself in the ass\"), is invoked to incite additional disgust, or express anger or outrage. For example, \"Fuck that!\", \"Fuck no!\", \"Fuck off!\", or \"Fuck you!\" By itself, \"fuck\" is usually used as an exclamation, indicating surprise, pain, fear, disgust, disappointment, anger, or a sense of extreme elation. In this usage, there is no connection to the sexual meaning of the word implied, and is used purely for its \"strength\" as a vulgarity. Additionally, other uses are similarly vacuous; \"fuck\" (or variations such as \"the fuck\" or \"fucking\") could be removed and leave a sentence of identical syntactical meaning. For example, rap music often uses the word \"fucking\" as an emphatic adjective (\"I'm the fucking man\") for the word's rhythmic properties. In British English, to express surprise and/or disbelief towards a given statement or a question, one can say \"does/is it fuck\".\n\nInsertion of the trochaic word \"fucking\" can also be used as an exercise for diagnosing the cadence of an English-language word. This is the use of \"fuck\" or more specifically \"fucking\" as an infix, or more properly, a tmesis (see expletive infixation). For example, the word \"in-fucking-credible\" sounds acceptable to the English ear, and is in fairly common use, while \"incred-fucking-ible\" would sound very clumsy (though, depending on the context, this might be perceived as a humorous improvisation of the word). \"Abso-fucking-lutely\" and \"motherfucking\" are also common uses of \"fuck\" as an affix. While neither dysphemistic nor connected to the sexual connotations of the word, even the vacuous usages are considered offensive and gratuitous, and censored in some media; for example, \"None of your fucking business!\" or \"Shut the fuck up!\" A common insult is \"Get fucked\", which in a non-offensive context would translate as \"get stuffed.\" The word is one of the few that has legitimate colloquial usage as a verb, adverb, adjective, command, conjunction, exclamatory, noun and pronoun.\n\nIn another usage, the word \"fucker\" is used as a term of endearment rather than antipathy. This usage is not uncommon; to say \"you're one smart fucker\" is often a term of affection. However, because of its ambiguity and vulgarity, the word \"fucker\" in reference to another person can easily be misinterpreted. Though \"fuck\" can serve as a noun, the \"fucker\" form is used in a context that refers to an individual. Normally in these cases, if \"fuck\" is used instead of \"fucker,\" the sentence refers to the sexual ability of the subject (for example, \"He's a great fuck!\"), although confusingly in a minority of occasions the word \"fuck\" can hold exactly the same meaning as \"fucker\" (e.g., when preceded by an adjective: \"You're a pretty clever fuck.\").\n\nRelated to \"fucker\" is the word \"motherfucker.\" Sometimes used as an extreme insult—an accusation of incest—this term is also occasionally used to connote respectful awe. For example, \"He's a mean motherfucker\" does not mean \"He's abusive, filthy and copulates with his mother,\" but \"He's someone to be afraid of.\" In this context, some people (particularly young men) might even describe themselves as \"motherfuckers.\" In a famous example, the wallet of \"Pulp Fiction\" character Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is embroidered with the phrase \"Bad Motherfucker\". The word \"fuck\" is used in many forms of music, with \"motherfucker\" being used as a rhythmic filler in hip hop, urban music and some rock genres; examples include The Crystal Method's song \"Name of the Game\" and Turbonegro's \"Don't Say Motherfucker Motherfucker\". Perhaps \"motherfucker's\" rhythmic compatibility is due to its quadrisyllabic pronunciation, making it a natural fit for popular music that is written in 4/4 metre; a notable example of this occurs in Sublime's 1996 single \"What I Got\" (\"I can play the guitar like / a motherfucking riot\"). Also contributing to its use in aggressive, high-energy music is the fact that it includes a hard \"k\" sound in its third syllable, making it easy to exclaim, particularly when pronounced as \"mutha fucka\". Despite these rhythmic qualities, \"motherfucker\" has not become as accepted in English usage as its root \"fuck\".\n\nThe word was used to induce stress during military recruit training and became a dominant element of an English military dialect identified by Tom Wolfe as \"Army creole\". A succinct example of the flexibility of the word is its use as almost every word in a sentence. In his book, \"Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War\", Paul Fussell, literary historian and professor emeritus of English literature at the University of Pennsylvania, recountedOnce, on a misty Scottish airfield, an airman was changing the magneto on the engine of a Wellington bomber. Suddenly his wrench slipped and he flung it on the grass and snarled, \"Fuck! The fucking fucker's fucked.\" The bystanders were all quite well aware that he had stripped a bolt and skinned his knuckles.\nIn the United States military air services, the nicknames applied to some aircraft included the word fucker as the letter \"F\" in their slang-acronyms. For instance, the B-52 stratofortress strategic bomber was often referred to as the BUFF, or Big Ugly Fat Fucker. Similarly, the A-7 Corsair was often referred to as the SLUF, or Short Little Ugly Fucker. In polite conversation, these acronyms usually substituted the word \"Fellow\" for fucker.\n\nThe phrase \"Fuck you, you fucking fuck!\" is a memorable quote from the movie \"Blue Velvet\" from 1986. Because of its vulgar status, the word \"fuck\" is usually restricted in mass media and barred from titles in the United States. In 2002, when the controversial French film \"Baise-moi\" (2000) was released in the US, its title was changed to \"Rape Me\", rather than the literal \"Fuck Me\". Similarly, the Swedish film \"Fucking Åmål\" was retitled \"Show Me Love\".\n\nOnline forums and public blogs may censor the word by use of automatic filters. For example, Fark.com replaces the word \"fuck\" with \"fark\". Others replace the word with asterisks (\"****\") to censor it (and other profanities) entirely. To avert these filters, many online posters will use the word \"fvck\". This particular alteration is in common usage at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where students use it in reference to the inscriptions on MIT's neoclassical buildings, in which the letter \"U\" is replaced by \"V.\" A typical coinage in this idiom would be \"I'm fvcked by the Institvte.\" (Other less common spellings to cheat a censor are \"fück\" and \"phuck\".) Another way to bypass a word filter is to use leet: fuck becomes F(_) c|< or |=(_)Ck, for example.\n\nThe word \"fuck\" is a component of many acronyms, some of which—like \"SNAFU\" and \"FUBAR\"—date as far back as World War II. Many more recent coinages, such as the shorthand \"WTF?\" for \"what the fuck?,\" \"STFU\" for \"shut the fuck up,\" or \"FML\" for \"fuck my life,\" have been widely extant on the Internet, and may count as examples of internet memes. Many acronyms will also have an \"F\" or \"MF\" added to increase emphasis; for example, \"OMG\" (\"oh my God\") becomes \"OMFG\" (\"oh my fucking God\"). Abbreviated versions of the word do not tend to be considered offensive. Although the word is proclaimed vulgar, several comedians rely on \"fuck\" for comedic routines. George Carlin created several literary works based upon the word. Other comedians who use or have used the word consistently in their routines include Billy Connolly, Denis Leary, Lewis Black, Andrew Dice Clay, Chris Rock, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and Sam Kinison.\n\nIn 1928, English writer D. H. Lawrence's novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" gained notoriety for its frequent use of the words \"fuck\", \"fucked\", and \"fucking\".\n\n\"The Catcher in the Rye\" by J. D. Salinger featured the use of \"fuck you\" in print. First published in the United States in 1951, the novel remains controversial to this day due in part to its use of the word, standing at number 13 for the most banned books from 1990 to 2000 according to the American Library Association.\n\nThe first documented use of the word \"fuck\" on live British television (and probably on any television system) has been attributed to theatre critic Kenneth Tynan in 1965, though it has been claimed Irish playwright Brendan Behan used the word on \"Panorama\" in 1956 (although no one could understand him because he was drunk) or the man who painted the railings on Stranmillis Embankment alongside the river Lagan in Belfast, who in 1959 told Ulster TV's teatime magazine programme, Roundabout, that his job was \"fucking boring\". Controversy also ensued in 1976 when \"Today\" host Bill Grundy interviewed the Sex Pistols, after guitarist Steve Jones called Grundy a \"dirty fucker\" and a \"fucking rotter\" (see EMI and the Grundy incident).\n\nJohn Cleese during his eulogy in the memorial service for Graham Chapman was proud to declare himself to be the first person to use the word \"fuck\" on such occasion.\n\nThe word began to break into cinema when it was uttered once in each of two 1967 British releases, \"Ulysses\" and \"I'll Never Forget What's'isname\". It was used several times in the 1969 British film \"Bronco Bullfrog\". According to director Robert Altman, the first time the word \"fuck\" was used in a major American studio film was in 1970's \"M*A*S*H\", spoken by Painless during the football match at the end of the film.\n\n\"Fuck\" is not widely used in politics, and use of the word by politicians often produces controversy. Some events include:\n\nIn April 1997, clothing retailer French Connection began branding their clothes \"fcuk\" (usually written in lowercase), stating it was an acronym for \"French Connection United Kingdom\". Its similarity to the word \"fuck\" caused controversy. French Connection produced a range of T-shirts with messages such as \"fcuk this\", \"hot as fcuk\", \"mile high fcuk\", \"fcuk me\", etc.\n\nIn 2009, the European Union's OHIM trade marks agency disallowed a German brewery to market a beer called \"Fucking Hell\". They sued, and on 26 March 2010 got permission to market the beer. They claim that it is actually named after the Austrian village of Fucking and the German term for light beer, \"hell\" (which is simply the word for \"light in colour\").\n\nThe word \"fuck\" has been used in a number of band names, generally based on common compounds. Although most of these bands are in the aggressive, non-mainstream genres of punk and metal, others fall into the categories of more accessible forms of electronic rock and pop.\n\n\"Holy fuck\" is an example of 'liturgical profanity' used interjectionally to express anger, contempt, disgust, or amazement. Usually vulgar. Noted by academics and used in literature, deriving its power from a combination of the sacred, holy, and the profane, fuck. An exclamation, similar to \"holy shit\", but more offensive, also used informally for sex within a religious context.\n\nThe word \"fuck\" occurs sometimes in Chinese/English bilingual public notices in China as a machine translation of the Simplified Chinese character 干 (干), which replaced the three Traditional Chinese characters 干 meaning \"a pole\", 幹 meaning \"to do\" or \"to work\" (and having a secondary slang meaning of \"to fuck\"), and 乾 meaning \"dried\". (Traditional Chinese 乾 can also be pronounced \"qian\", which is a Taoist stem word meaning \"sky\".) Some examples are \"spread to fuck the fruit\" for \"loose dried fruit\", \"fuck to adjust the area\" for \"dry seasonings section\", and \"fuck the certain price of goods\" for \"dry foods price counter\". The fault occurred in some versions of commonly used Chinese to English machine translators, for example Jinshan (金山 = \"Gold Mountain\") by Kingsoft.\n\nThe term \"dropping an F-bomb\" usually refers to the unanticipated use of the word \"fuck\" in an unexpected setting, such as public media, a play on the nickname for the hydrogen bomb (the \"H-bomb\") and the shock value that using the word \"fuck\" in discourse carries. The term was first reported in a newspaper (Newsday) in 1988 when Hall of Fame baseball catcher Gary Carter used it. In 2012 it was listed, for the first time, in the mainstream \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\".\n\nOn August 19, 1969 the acid rock band Jefferson Airplane played their song \"We Can Be Together\" uncensored on \"The Dick Cavett Show\", including the 1960s countercultural slogan \"Up against the wall, motherfucker!\" (which was also the name of an anarchist group at that time). This was the first appearance of the word on U.S. television. The word \"motherfucker\" was also censored on the song's printed lyrics that came with the Volunteers album as \"fred.\"\n\nFilms edited for broadcast use matching euphemisms so that lip synching will not be thrown off. In the film \"The Big Lebowski\", John Goodman's character repeatedly yells, \"This is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass\" while trashing a car. It was censored on television as \"This is what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps.\"\n\nIn 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the public display of \"fuck\" is protected under the First and Fourteenth amendments and cannot be made a criminal offense. In 1968, Paul Robert Cohen had been convicted of disturbing the peace for wearing a jacket with a slogan titled \"Fuck the Draft\" (in a reference to conscription in the Vietnam War). The conviction was upheld by the court of appeals and overturned by the Supreme Court. \"Cohen v. California\", \"403 U.S. 15\" (1971).\n\nIn conversation or writing, reference to or use of the word \"fuck\" may be replaced by any of many alternative words or phrases, including \"the F-word\" or \"the F-bomb\" (a play on \"A-bomb\" and \"H-bomb\"), or simply, \"eff\" or \"f\" (as in \"What the eff\" or \"You effing fool\", \"What the F\" or \"You f'ing fool\"). Also, there are many commonly used substitutes, such as \"flipping\", \"frigging\", \"fricking\", \"freaking\", \"feck\", \"fudge\", \"flaming\" or any of a number of similar-sounding nonsense words. In print, there are alternatives such as, \"F***\", \"F––k\", etc.; or a string of non-alphanumeric characters, for example, \"@$#*%!\" and similar (especially favored in comic books).\n\nA replacement word used mainly on the Internet is \"fsck\", derived from the name of the Unix \"f\"ile \"s\"ystem \"c\"hec\"k\"ing utility. In \"Battlestar Galactica\" the bowdlerized form 'frack' (spelt 'f-r-a-k' in the reimagined 2003 version) was used as a substitute for fuck. The word was sometimes jokingly used as a curse by fans. Similarly, the word \"frell\" is used as a substitute on the TV show \"Farscape\", and Dr. Elliot Reid (played by Sarah Chalke) has frequently used the substitute \"frick\" on the TV show \"Scrubs\". Stu Braudy, a recurring character on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" played by Don Stark, is teased by Larry David for constantly using the substitute \"freak\" (\"Ahh, freak you!\").\n\nThe phrase \"feck\" is a common substitute for \"fuck\" in Ireland, where it is considered to be less rude, though still not acceptable in many contexts. It has come into occasional use across the UK in the last 15 years as a result of its frequent use in the \"Father Ted\" comedy series. Although the word is considered to be equally as rude as \"fuck\", its appearance in \"Father Ted\" and in a Magner's Cider ad suggest the opposite.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4694311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4694311", "title": "Gliosis", "text": "Gliosis\n\nGliosis is a nonspecific reactive change of glial cells in response to damage to the central nervous system (CNS). In most cases, gliosis involves the proliferation or hypertrophy of several different types of glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. In its most extreme form, the proliferation associated with gliosis leads to the formation of a glial scar.\n\nThe process of gliosis involves a series of cellular and molecular events that occur over several days. Typically, the first response to injury is the migration of macrophages and local microglia to the injury site. This process, which constitutes a form of gliosis known as microgliosis, begins within hours of the initial CNS injury. Later, after 3–5 days, oligodendrocyte precursor cells are also recruited to the site and may contribute to remyelination. The final component of gliosis is astrogliosis, the proliferation of surrounding astrocytes, which are the main constituents of the glial scar.\n\nGliosis has historically been given a negative connotation due to its appearance in many CNS diseases and the inhibition of axonal regeneration caused by glial scar formation. However, gliosis has been shown to have both beneficial and detrimental effects, and the balance between these is due to a complex array of factors and molecular signaling mechanisms, which affect the reaction of all glial cell types.\n\nReactive astrogliosis is the most common form of gliosis and involves the proliferation of astrocytes, a type of glial cell responsible for maintaining extracellular ion and neurotransmitter concentrations, modulating synapse function, and forming the blood–brain barrier. Like other forms of gliosis, astrogliosis accompanies traumatic brain injury as well as many neuropathologies, ranging from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis to Fatal Familial Insomnia. Although the mechanisms which lead to astrogliosis are not fully understood, neuronal injury is well understood to cause astrocyte proliferation, and astrogliosis has long been used as an index for neuronal damage. Traditionally, astrogliosis has been defined as an increase in intermediate filaments and cellular hypertrophy as well as an increase in the proliferation of astrocytes. Although this hypertrophy and proliferation in their extreme form are most closely associated with the formation of a glial scar, astrogliosis is not an all-or-none process in which a glial scar forms. In fact, it is a spectrum of changes that occur based on the type and severity of central nervous system (CNS) injury or disease triggering the event. Changes in astrocyte function or morphology which occur during astrogliosis may range from minor hypertrophy to major hypertrophy, domain overlap, and ultimately, glial scar formation. The severity of astrogliosis is classically determined by the level of expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, both of which are upregulated with the proliferation of active astrocytes.\n\nChanges in astrogliosis are regulated in a context-dependent fashion, and the signaling events which dictate these changes may modify both their nature and severity. It is these changes in astrogliosis which allow the process to be complex and multifaceted, involving both a gain or loss of function as well as both beneficial and detrimental effects. Reactive astrocytes are affected by molecular signals released from a variety of CNS cell types including neurons, microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, leukocytes, endothelia, and even other astrocytes. Some of the many signalling molecules used in these pathways include the cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Although many of these specific modulatory relationships are not yet fully understood, it is known that different specific signaling mechanisms result in different morphological and functional changes of astrocytes, allowing astrogliosis to take on a graduated spectrum of severity.\n\nAlthough astrogliosis has traditionally been viewed as a negative response inhibitory to axonal regeneration, the process is highly conserved, suggesting it has important benefits beyond its detrimental effects. Generally, the effects of astrogliosis vary with the context of the initial CNS insult and also with time after the injury. A few of the most important effects of astrogliosis are listed below.\n\n\n\nMicroglia, another type of glial cell, act as macrophage-like cells in the CNS when activated. Unlike other glial cell types, microglia are extremely sensitive to even small changes in the cellular environment, allowing for a rapid response to inflammatory signals and prompt destruction of infectious agents before sensitive neural tissue can be damaged. Due to their fast response time, microgliosis, or the activation of microglia, is commonly the first observed stage of gliosis.\n\nMicrogliosis following a CNS insult most commonly involves the development of an altered cellular morphology, specifically the enlargement of cellular processes. The microglial immunological surface receptor CR3 is also upregulated within 24 hours after the initial injury. Within the first week following the injury, microglia begin to proliferate abnormally and while doing so exhibit several immunophenotypic changes, particularly an increased expression of MHC antigens. The population of activated microglia at the site of a CNS injury includes not only endogenous microglia of the CNS but also exogeneous perivascular cells originating in the bone marrow that migrate to the area and transform into microglia to supplement the microgliosis response.\n\nWhile in their activated state, microglia may serve a variety of beneficial functions. For example, active microglia are the primary effectors of innate immunity and fulfill this role by phagocyting the proteins of dead neurons, presenting antigens at their surface, and producing a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and toxic molecules that compromise the survival of surrounding neurons which may be similarly damaged or infected. Active microglia also perform critical homeostatic activity, including the clearing of cell debris through phagocytosis, a function essential to neuron survival. In addition, active microglia release anti-inflammatory factors and other molecules, such as IL-6 and TGF-β, which regulate neurogenesis after injury. However, the over-activation of microglia can also be detrimental by producing several neurotoxic substances including pro-inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α, prostaglandin E2, and interferon-γ, and oxidative stress factors, including nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide. Notably, unlike astrogliosis, microgliosis is a temporary and self-limited event, which generally lasts only one month after injury, even in cases of extreme damage.\n\nMicroglial activation has been shown to be a reactive process in which microglia respond to signals given off by injured neurons. Because various characteristics of microgliosis occur in different time frames after the initial triggering insult, microgliosis must depend on mechanisms which fluctuate temporally based on injured neuronal signals. Studies have shown that in cases of reversible neuronal injury, such as axotomy, neuron signals cause microglia to produce trophic factors, which promote neuron survival. In cases of irreversible injury, however, microglia are induced to release neurotoxic factors that promote increased degeneration of the neuron and more rapid phagocytosis by the microglia. Such specificity of the process of microgliosis indicates that it primarily serves a beneficial purpose, selectively conserving some neural tissue while eliminating others, based on the specific initial CNS insult.\n\nAlthough the molecular triggers of gliosis, including both astrogliosis and microgliosis, are not fully understood, in vitro studies have indicated that activated microglia have an important role in initiating and modulating astrogliosis. One critical piece of evidence supporting this relationship is the widely documented temporal correlation between the onsets of the two processes. Unlike the microglial response, which occurs rapidly, the start of astrogliosis is often delayed. A likely cause of this relationship is the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines released at elevated levels by microglia upon activation. These include macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), the interleukins IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, and TNF-α. Receptors for these molecules have been identified on astrocytes, and the molecules, when exogenously introduced, have been shown to induce, enhance, or accompany astrogliosis. Astrocytes themselves also produce cytokines, which may be used for self-regulation or for the regulation of microglia, which contain similar cytokine receptors. This phenomenon creates a feedback loop, allowing both microglia and astrocytes to regulate one another. In addition, evidence suggests microglial regulation of astrogliosis may also include inhibitory effects. Reduced levels of microgliosis have been associated with reduced astrocyte numbers, which also suggests that microglia are important regulators of the degree of astrocyte activation.\n\nOligodendrocytes are another type of glial cell which generate and maintain the formation of myelin around the axons of large neurons in the CNS, allowing for rapid transmission of neural signals. Unlike astrocytes and microglia, oligodendrocytes undergo a much more limited reaction to injury. Rather, in cases of CNS trauma, they are more similar to neurons in their susceptibility to sustaining damage. The degeneration of axons as a result of trauma or pathology invariably results in the degeneration of the myelin sheath. Depending on the mechanism of insult, several different patterns of oligodendrocyte injury and reaction may be observed. In all cases, however, some oligodendrocytes are lost, through necrosis or apoptosis, while others survive and may form part of the glial scar along with myelin debris. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells are also affected by CNS insult and are recruited to demyelinated areas within a week following traumatic injury. Some of these cells may produce new myelin when exposed to signals from activated microglia and astrocytes.\n\nIn general after any CNS insult, gliosis begins after the blood brain barrier is disrupted, allowing non-CNS molecules, such as blood and serum components, to enter the brain. These components, along with activated macrophages they carry, are known to have a role in beginning the formation of the glial scar by inducing the disconnection of axons, also called secondary axotomy, and the upregulation of fibrous extracellular matrix components which eventually form the scar tissue. The specific molecular triggers responsible for this action, however, remain unknown. One potential trigger is transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). TGF-β2, whose expression is gradually increased as gliosis occurs, has been shown to increase astrocyte production of scar-forming proteoglycans. Experimental reduction of both TGF-β2 and TGF-β1, which is expressed immediately after injury, has resulted in reduced glial scarring. The interleukins are another potential molecular trigger of gliosis. These molecules, notably IL-1, initiate an inflammatory response in various cells including astrocytes that contributes to the gliosis reaction. Finally, interactions between the inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) may also be responsible for the induction of gliosis. In culture, both molecules act as mitogens, prompting the proliferation of astrocytes. Moreover, addition of IFN-γ to brain legion sites has resulted in an increase in glial scarring.\n\nGliosis is the universal response of the CNS to tissue injury and occurs as a result of many acute conditions such as trauma, ischemia, and stroke. Additionally, gliosis is present in a wide variety of CNS pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Korsakoff's syndrome, multiple system atrophy, prion disease, multiple sclerosis, AIDS dementia complex, vasculitis, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. In every case, gliosis involves some degree of hypertrophy or proliferation of glial cells, but the extent and nature of the gliosis response vary widely based on the triggering insult. Gliosis in any form entails an alteration in cellular activity that has the potential to create widespread effects on neurons as well as other non-neural cells, causing either a loss of normal functions or a gain of detrimental ones. In this light, gliosis may be seen not only as a characteristic of many neuropathologies but as a potential contributor to, or even cause of, many CNS disease mechanisms. A select group of CNS conditions associated with gliosis are described below.\n\nAcute trauma to the brain or spinal cord results in gliosis, most often in its severe form with the development of a glial scar. Different locations around the lesion site may exhibit different severities of gliosis; for example, a glial scar at the location of damaged tissue may be surrounded by areas with less severe astrocyte proliferation or hypertrophy. Diffuse traumatic injury can result in diffuse or more moderate gliosis without scar formation. In such cases, gliosis may also be reversible. In all instances of gliosis resulting from CNS trauma, the long-term clinical outcome is highly dependent on the degree of astrogliosis and scar formation.\n\nGliosis is a prominent feature of many autoimmune inflammatory disorders, notably multiple sclerosis, in which demyelinated plaques are surrounded by reactive astrocytes. These astrocytes often exhibit extreme hypertrophy and multiple distinct nuclei, and their production of pro-inflammatory molecules has been implicated in several inflammatory disorders. Cytokines produced by both active astrocytes and microglia in inflammatory conditions may contribute to myelin damage and may alter blood-brain barrier permeability, allowing the migration of lymphocytes into the CNS and heightening the autoimmune attack.\n\nIn vertebrates, the retina contains Müller cells, a type of glia not found elsewhere in the CNS. Upon retinal injury, gliosis of these cells occurs, functioning to repair damage, but often having harmful consequences in the process, worsening some of the diseases or problems that initially trigger it. Reactive gliosis in the retina can have detrimental effects on vision; in particular, the production of proteases by astrocytes causes widespread death of retinal ganglion cells. A 2011 study compared the effects of two glial toxins, AAA and Neurostatin, on retinal gliosis in mice. AAA did not inhibit the production of protease by astrocytes, and so did not prevent ganglion cell apoptosis. However, Neurostatin successfully inhibited activation of astrocytes, in turn decreasing retinal ganglion cell death significantly. Neurostatin is also effective in the inhibition of other glial cells, and may be an area of interest in the treatment of degenerative diseases such as glaucoma.\n\nMassive retinal gliosis (MRG) is a phenomenon in which the retina is completely replaced by proliferation of glial cells, causing deterioration of vision and even blindness in some cases. Sometimes mistaken for an intraocular tumor, MRG can arise from a neurodegenerative disease, congenital defect, or from trauma to the eyeball, sometimes appearing years after such an incident.\n\nGliosis has long been known as a characteristic of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), although its exact role in the disease remains unknown. Gliosis and glial scarring occur in areas surrounding the amyloid plaques which are hallmarks of the disease, and postmortem tissues have indicated a correlation between the degree of astrogliosis and cognitive decline. Exposure of reactive astrocytes to β-amyloid (Αβ) peptide, the main component of amyloid plaques, may also induce astroglial dysfunction and neurotoxicity. In addition, the ability of reactive astrocytes to degrade extracellular Αβ deposits may suggest that astrogliosis may affect the progression or severity of AD.\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating disease involving the degeneration of motor neurons in the CNS. Reactive astrocytes have been implicated in this condition through either a loss of their neuroprotective ability or through the gain of neurotoxic effects. Late stages of ALS are also characterized by significant astrogliosis and astrocyte proliferation around areas of degeneration.\n\nThe implications of gliosis in various neuropathologies and injury conditions has led to the investigation of various therapeutic routes which would regulate specific aspects of gliosis in order to improve clinical outcomes for both CNS trauma and a wide range of neurological disorders. Because gliosis is a dynamic process which involves a spectrum of changes depending on the type and severity of the initial insult, to date, no single molecular target has been identified which could improve healing in all injury contexts. Rather, therapeutic strategies for minimizing the contribution of astrogliosis to CNS pathologies must be designed to target specific molecular pathways and responses. One promising therapeutic mechanism is the use of β-lactam antibiotics to enhance the glutamate uptake of astrocytes in order to reduce excitotoxicity and provide neuroprotection in models of stroke and ALS. Other proposed targets related to astrogliosis include manipulating AQP4 channels, diminishing the action of NF-kB, or regulating the STAT3 pathway in order to reduce the inflammatory effects of reactive astrocytes. Astrogliosis may also be attenuated by inhibiting the microgliosis response. One notable microglial activation inhibitor is minocycline, which is a known suppressor of astrogliosis. The cell cycle inhibitor olomoucine also has been shown to suppress both microglial and astroglial proliferation as well as glial scar formation. Future directions for identifying novel therapeutic strategies must carefully account for the complex array of factors and signaling mechanisms driving the gliosis response, particularly in different stages after damage and in different lesion conditions.\n\n"}

{"id": "6018453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6018453", "title": "Helvetism", "text": "Helvetism\n\nHelvetisms (New Latin \"Helvetia\" \"Switzerland\" and \"-ism\") are features distinctive of Swiss Standard German, that distinguish it from Standard German. The most frequent Helvetisms are in vocabulary and pronunciation, but there are also some distinctive features within syntax and orthography.\n\nThe French and Italian spoken in Switzerland have similar terms, which are also known as Helvetisms. Current French dictionaries, such as the Petit Larousse, include several hundred helvetisms.\n\nThe definitive work for German orthography, the Duden, explicitly declares a number of helvetisms as correct Standard German – albeit with the \"[schweiz.]\" annotation, denoting that the usage of the word is limited to Switzerland. However, not all words may be considered part of the \"Swiss standard language\"/\"Swiss standard German\" category, because frequency of usage must be evaluated as well; if this does not apply, or if a word's use is known to span only one or more specific dialectal regions, the word must be categorized \"dialectal\" (German: \"mundartlich\", often abbreviated \"mdal.\")\n\nIn orthographical terms, the most significant difference to Standard German outside Switzerland is the absence of \"ß\" (eszett). (After having been officially abandoned in the Canton of Zürich in 1935, this character gradually fell into disuse, until it was eventually dropped by the \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung\" in 1974.)\n\nIn everyday language, Helvetisms may be used both consciously and unconsciously by a Swiss German native speaker. Classic examples of Helvetism usage throughout entire literary works are found in a large part of Swiss literature, notably Jeremias Gotthelf's novels located in the Emmental; a contemporary example would be Tim Krohn in his \"Quatemberkinder\". Another group, the most notable of whom is Peter Bichsel, deliberately use Helvetisms to arouse a sort of emotional attachment to the readers' home country: Bichsel is notorious for using dialectal words like \"Beiz\" (instead of \"Kneipe\" [English: \"pub\"]), or \"Kasten\" (instead of \"Schrank\" [English: \"cupboard/cabinet/closet\"]) in his \"San Salvador\" short story. Lastly, there is yet another group of authors whose readers are known to be located all over the German-speaking territory (Germany, Austria, Switzerland as well as some smaller minorities in other European countries) and therefore traditionally refrain from using any Helvetisms in their literary works.\n\nIn addition, words which are used outside Switzerland, but which originate from Swiss German may be called \"Helvetisms\".\n\nAnalogously to \"Helvetisms\", there are also Austricisms and Germanisms (also \"Teutonicisms\").\n\n\nIn the area's cuisine, local culture and politics, there are numerous peculiarities that are not well known outside Switzerland and which do not have an equivalent standard German expression. \n\nBecause of their characteristic pronunciation, speakers of Swiss Standard German will be instantly recognized by other German speakers in most cases.\n\nIn general, the pronunciation of Swiss Standard German is influenced by the respective Swiss German dialect of each speaker. The degree of that influence may vary according to their education.\n\nIn Switzerland some words are stressed on different syllables from in the rest of the German-speaking area (marked with an accent here):\n\n\n\nA special feature of Swiss Standard German, is a somewhat \"singing\" cadence. That means that each word's stressed syllable isn't only marked through the higher voice volume, but also through a distinguishable modification of the voice's sound. In general, the pitch of the stressed syllable sinks.\n\n\nIn orthography, the most visible difference from Standard German usage outside Switzerland is the absence of \"ß\" (officially abolished in the Canton of Zürich in 1935; the sign fell gradually out of use and was dropped by the \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung\" (\"NZZ\") in 1974).\n\nFrench and Italian loanwords are written in their original forms – despite the spelling reform. \"Majonäse\" stays \"Mayonnaise\", and \"Spagetti\" stays \"Spaghetti\". The \"NZZ\" has even chosen the word \"placieren\", to not have to write \"platzieren\".\n\nGeographical names, such as streets, are mostly written together: \"Baslerstrasse\", \"Genfersee\", \"Zugerberg\" etc., but also \"Schweizergrenze\", \"Schweizervolk\" (very often).\n\nUmlauts on the first letter of Swiss proper names are written as <Ae>, <Oe> and <Ue>: \"Aebi\", \"Oerlikon\", \"Uetliberg\" (pronounced Üetliberg, not Ütliberg).\n\nFinally, there are specialities like e.g.\n\nSome of the above-mentioned characteristics are due to the general introduction of the typewriter in economics and administration. Because a Swiss typewriter must be able to write not only German texts but also French and Italian texts, the limited number of keys wasn't enough for all these languages' special characters to be included. So, the eszett and the uppercase umlauts (\"Ä\", \"Ö\" and \"Ü\"), as well as other upper-case accented vowels (e.g. \"À\" or \"É\"), were missed out.\n\nSwiss German differs from Standard German in, for example, the gender of nouns (das E-Mail\", das Tram\" and \"das SMS\" instead of \"die\") or in the preposotion that verbs require (\"jemanden anfragen\" instead of \"bei jemandem anfragen\").\n\nIn general, more often than in Germany or Austria, the Swiss use female descriptions of professions instead of using a generic masculine (\"Bundesrätin Ruth Metzler\", \"Frieda U. wurde zur Primarschullehrerin gewählt\"). The \"Binnen-I\" (as in \"ProfessorIn\") is not used only by \"politically correct\" people.\n\nRelative pronouns: The relative pronoun \"welche(r)\", considered clumsy and antiquated in Standard German, is used without hesitation: in \"Damit wurde in der Schweiz ein Kompetenzzentrum für Klimafragen geschaffen, welches verstärkt die Bedürfnisse der Bevölkerung in den Mittelpunkt ihrer Forschung stellt.\" (from Jahresbericht 2001, Annual report of the ETH Zürich).\n\n\"Rabatt\" is used in the dative case; in Standard German in the accusative case. Example: \"20% Rabatt auf allen Artikeln\".\n\nThe syntax has a lot of constructions with a shortened main clause and a following subordinate clause, which is only marked by the initial position of a verb, e.g.\n\nIn his book \"Zündels Abgang\", author Markus Werner uses \"Tram\" (\"tram\") – which takes the female article \"die\" in Germany's Standard German – with the typically Swiss neuter article \"das\".\n\nThe word \"Putsch\" is one example which is widely used in political contexts, even in notable Standard German newspapers. The word \"Müsli\", however, is a special case: in Swiss Standard German (and only there), \"Müsli\" is the diminutive of \"Mus\" (\"mouse\") and stands for \"little mouse\". To describe the food, the Swiss use the spelling \"Müesli\" (reflecting the pronunciation of the dialects).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "513248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=513248", "title": "Lakota language", "text": "Lakota language\n\nLakota (), also referred to as Lakhota, Teton or Teton Sioux, is a Siouan language spoken by the Lakota people of the Sioux tribes. Though generally taught and considered by speakers as a separate language, Lakota is mutually intelligible with the other two languages (such as Dakota language), and is considered by most linguists as one of the three major varieties of the Sioux language. \n\nSpeakers of the Lakota language make up one of the largest Native American language speech communities in the United States, with approximately 2,000 speakers, who live mostly in the northern plains states of North Dakota and South Dakota. There is a Lakota language program online available for children to use. There is also a Lakota Language Program with classes for children at Red Cloud Indian School.\n\nThe language was first put into written form by European-American missionaries around 1840. It has since evolved to reflect contemporary needs and usage.\n\nThe Lakota people's creation stories say that language originated from the creation of the tribe.\n\nLakota has five oral vowels, , and three nasal vowels, (phonetically ). Lakota and are said to be more open than the corresponding cardinal vowels, perhaps closer to and . Orthographically, the nasal vowels are written with a following , , or ; historically, these were written with ogoneks underneath, . No syllables end with consonantal .\n\nA neutral vowel (schwa) is automatically inserted between certain consonants, e.g. into the pairs , and . So the clan name written phonemically as has become the place name \"Ogallala\".\n\nThe voiced uvular fricative becomes a uvular trill () before and in fast speech it is often realized as a voiced velar fricative . The voiceless aspirated plosives have two allophonic variants each: those with a delay in voicing , and those with velar friction , which occur before , , , , and (thus, , is phonetically ). For some speakers, there is a phonemic distinction between the two, and both occur before . No such variation occurs for the affricate /tʃʰ/. Some orthographies mark this distinction; others do not. The uvular fricatives and are commonly spelled and .\n\nAll monomorphemic words have one vowel which carries primary stress and has a higher tone than all other vowels in the word. This is generally the vowel of the second syllable of the word, but often the first syllable can be stressed, and occasionally other syllables as well. Stress is generally indicated with an acute accent: , etc. Compound words will have stressed vowels in each component; proper spelling will write compounds with a hyphen. Thus , literally \"metal-white\", i.e. \"silver; money\" has two stressed vowels, the first \"a\" in each component. If it were written without the hyphen, as , it would imply a single main stress.\n\nThe majority of educational institutions across Lakota country adopted the writing system of the \"New Lakota Dictionary\" as the standard orthography. It is used, among other places, at Sitting Bull College, Oglala Lakota College, by all schools of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, by the majority of teachers of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and in almost all schools on Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations.. Sinte Gleska University is said to have been using an orthography developed by Albert White Hat, but apart from one elementary level textbook, no literature, learning materials, or dictionaries have been developed with this orthography. The spelling system is not used by Sinte Gleska University language instructors during classes. Historically several orthographies as well as \"ad hoc\" spelling have been used to write the Lakota language. \n\nThe spelling system of the \"New Lakota Dictionary\" is presented below:\n\nThe vowels are \"a, e, i, o, u;\" nasal vowels are \"aŋ, iŋ, uŋ.\" Pitch accent is marked with an acute accent: \"á, é, í, ó, ú, áŋ, íŋ, úŋ\" on stressed vowels (which receive a higher tone than non-stressed ones)\n\nThe following consonants approximate their IPA values: \"b, g, h, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w, z\". \"Y\" has its English value of . An apostrophe, ’, is used for glottal stop.\n\nA caron is used for sounds which are not written with Latin letters in the IPA: \"č\" , \"ǧ\" , \"ȟ\" , \"š\" , \"ž\" . Aspirates are written with \"h\": \"čh, kh, ph, th,\" and velar frication with \"ȟ\": \"kȟ, pȟ, tȟ.\" Ejectives are written with an apostrophe: \"č’, ȟ’, k’, p’, s’, š’, t’‌\".\n\nThe spelling used in modern popular texts is often written without diacritics. Besides failing to mark stress, this also results in the confusion of numerous consonants: and are both written \"s\", and are both written \"h\", and the aspirate stops are written like the unaspirates, as \"p, t, c, k\".\n\nStandard Lakota Orthography, as used by the majority of schools, is in principle phonemic, which means that each character (grapheme) represents one distinctive sound (phoneme), except for the distinction between glottal and velar aspiration, which is treated phonetically.\n\nAll digraphs (i.e. characters created by two letters, such as kh, kȟ, k’) are treated as groups of individual letters in alphabetization. Thus for example the word precedes in a dictionary.\n\nA common phonological process which occurs in rapid speech is \"vowel contraction\", which generally results from the loss of an intervocalic glide. Vowel contraction results in phonetic long vowels (phonemically a sequence of two identical vowels), with falling pitch if the first underlying vowel is stressed, and rising pitch if the second underlying vowel is stressed: \"kê:\" (falling tone), \"he said that\", from ; \"hǎ:pi\" (rising tone), \"clothing\", from . If one of the vowels is nasalized, the resulting long vowel is also nasalized: \"čhaŋ̌:pi\", \"sugar\", from .\n\nWhen two vowels of unequal height contract, or when feature contrasts exist between the vowels and the glide, two new phonetic vowels, and , result: \"iyæ̂:\", \"he left for there\", from ; \"mitȟa:\", \"it's mine\", from .\n\nThe plural enclitic \"=pi\" is frequently changed in rapid speech when preceding the enclitics \"=kte\", \"=kiŋ\", \"=kštó\", or \"=na\". If the vowel preceding \"=pi\" is high/open, \"=pi\" becomes [u]; if the vowel is non-high (mid or closed), \"=pi\" becomes [o] (if the preceding vowel is nasalized, then the resulting vowel is also nasalized): \"hi=pi=kte\", \"they will arrive here\", [hiukte]; \"yatkáŋ=pi=na\", \"they drank it and...\", .\n\nLakota also exhibits some traces of sound symbolism among fricatives, where the point of articulation changes to reflect intensity: , \"it's yellow\", , \"it's tawny\", , \"it's brown\". (Compare with the similar examples in Mandan.)\n\nThe basic word order of Lakota is subject–object–verb, although the order can be changed for expressive purposes (placing the object before the subject to bring the object into focus or placing the subject after the verb to emphasize its status as established information). It is postpositional, with adpositions occurring after the head nouns: , \"at the store\" (literally 'store at'); , \"around the house\" (literally 'house=the around') (Rood and Taylor 1996).\n\nRood and Taylor (1996) suggest the following template for basic word order. Items in parenthesis are optional; only the verb is required. It is therefore possible to produce a grammatical sentence that contains only a verb.\n\nWhen interjections are used, they begin the sentence. A small number of interjections are used only by one gender, for instance the interjection expressing disbelief is for women but for men; for calling attention women say while men use . Most interjections, however, are used by both genders.\n\nIt is common for a sentence to begin with a conjunction. Both and can be translated as \"and\"; is similar to English \"but\". Each of these conjunctions joins clauses. In addition, the conjunction joins nouns or phrases.\n\nLakota uses postpositions, which are similar to English prepositions, but follow their noun complement. Adverbs or postpositional phrases can describe manner, location, or reason. There are also interrogative adverbs, which are used to form questions.\n\nTo the non-Lakota speaker, the postpositions and sound like they can be interchangeable, but although they are full synonyms of each other, they are used in different occasions. Semantically (word meaning), they are used as locational and directional tools. In the English language they can be compared to prepositions like \"at\", \"in\", and \"on\" (when used as locatives) on the one hand, and \"at\", \"in\", and \"on\" (when used as directionals), \"to\", \"into\", and \"onto\", on the other. (Pustet 2013)\n\nA pointer for when to use and when to use can be determined by the concepts of location (motionless) or motion; and space vs. time. These features can produce four different combinations, also called semantic domains, which can be arranged as follows (Pustet 2013):\n\n\nSummed up, when a context describes no motion, is the appropriate postposition; when in motion, is more appropriate. They are both used in matters of time and space.\n\nAs mentioned above, nominals are optional in Lakota, but when nouns appear the basic word order is subject–object–verb. Pronouns are not common, but may be used contrastively or emphatically.\n\nLakota has four articles: is indefinite, similar to English \"a\" or \"an\", and is definite, similar to English \"the\". In addition, is an indefinite article used with hypothetical or irrealis objects, and is a definite article used with nouns that have been mentioned previously.\n\nThere are also nine demonstratives, which can function either as pronouns or as determiners.\n\nThe demonstrative is the most neutral. Once a noun has been located, either by pointing or by description, in space or in the listener’s mind, can then be used. Before that, or is usually used to demonstrate exactly what is meant, although may also be used while pointing.\n\nVerbs are the only word class that are obligatory in a Lakota sentence. Verbs can be active, naming an action, or stative, describing a property. (Note that in English, such descriptions are usually made with adjectives.)\n\nVerbs are inflected for first-, second- or third person, and for singular, dual or plural grammatical number.\n\nThere are two paradigms for verb inflection. One set of morphemes indicates the person and number of the subject of active verbs. The other set of morphemes agrees with the object of transitive action verbs \"or\" the subject of stative verbs.\n\nMost of the morphemes in each paradigm are prefixes, but plural subjects are marked with a suffix and third-person plural objects with an infix.\n\nFirst person arguments may be singular, dual, or plural; second or third person arguments may be singular or plural.\n\nExamples: \"máni\" \"He walks.\" \"mánipi\" \"They walk.\"\n\nExample: \"waŋwíčhayaŋke\" \"He looked at them\" from \"waŋyáŋkA\" \"to look at something/somebody\".\n\nSubject and object pronouns in one verb\nIf both the subject and object need to be marked, two affixes occur on the verb. Below is a table illustrating this. Subject affixes are marked in \"italics\" and object affixes are marked in underline. Some affixes encompass both subject and object (such as \"čhi\"- ...). The symbol ∅ indicates a lack of marking for a particular subject/object (as in the case of 3rd Person Singular forms). Cells with three forms indicate Class I, Class II, and Class III verb forms in this order.\nExample: \"uŋkánipȟepi\" \"We are waiting for you\" from \"apȟé\" \"to wait for somebody\".\nExample: \"iwíčhauŋkičupi\" \"We took them\" from \"ičú\" \"to take something/somebody\".\n\nLakota has a number of enclitic particles which follow the verb, many of which differ depending on whether the speaker is male or female.\n\nSome enclitics indicate the aspect, mood, or number of the verb they follow. There are also various interrogative enclitics, which in addition to marking an utterance as a question show finer distinctions of meaning. For example, while \"he\" is the usual question-marking enclitic, \"huŋwó\" is used for rhetorical questions or in formal oratory, and the dubitative \"wa\" functions somewhat like a tag question in English (Rood and Taylor 1996; Buchel 1983). (See also the section below on men and women's speech.)\n\nA small number of enclitics (approximately eight) differ in form based on the gender of the speaker. \"Yeló\" (men) \"ye\" (women) mark mild assertions. \"Kštó\" (women only according to most sources) marks strong assertion. \"Yo\" (men) and \"ye\" (women) mark neutral commands, \"yetȟó\" (men) and \"nitȟó\" (women) mark familiar, and \"ye\" (both men and women) and \"na\" mark requests. \"He\" is used by both genders to mark direct questions, but men also use \"hųwó\" in more formal situations. \"So\" (men) and \"se\" (women) mark dubitative questions (where the person being asked is not assumed to know the answer).\n\nWhile many native speakers and linguists agree that certain enclitics are associated with particular genders, such usage may not be exclusive. That is, individual men sometimes use enclitics associated with women, and vice versa (Trechter 1999).\n\nExamples of enclitic usage\n\nThe term \"ablaut\" refers to the tendency of some words to change their final vowel in certain situations. Compare these sentences.\n\n\"Šúŋka kiŋ sápa čha waŋbláke.\" \n\"Šúŋka kiŋ sápe.\" \n\"Šúŋka kiŋ sápiŋ na tȟáŋka.\"\n\nThe last vowel in the word \"SápA\" changed each time. This vowel change is called \"ablaut\". Words which undergo this change are referred to as A-words, since, in dictionary citations, they are written ending in either -A or -Aŋ. These words are never written with a final capital letter in actual texts. Derivatives of these words generally take the ablaut as well, however there are exceptions.\n\nThere are three forms for ablauted words: \"-a/-aŋ\", \"-e\", \"-iŋ\". These are referred to as a/aŋ-ablaut, e-ablaut, and iŋ-ablaut respectively. Some words are ablauted by some and not others, like \"gray\" \"hóta\" or \"hótA\". Ablaut always depends on what word follows the ablauted word.\n\nThis is the basic form of the word, and is used everywhere in which the other forms are not utilized.\n\nThere are two cases in which e-ablaut is used.\n\n\nThere are three classes of words which trigger e-ablaut\n\na) various enclitics, such as \"ȟča, ȟčiŋ, iŋčhéye, kačháš, kiló, kštó, któk, lakȟa, -la, láȟ, láȟčaka, ló, séčA, sékse, s’eléčheča, so, s’a, s’e, šaŋ, šni, uŋštó\"\nb) some conjunctions and articles, such as \"kiŋ, kiŋháŋ, k’éaš, k’uŋ, eháŋtaŋš\"\nc) some auxiliary verbs, such as \"kapíŋ, kiníča (kiníl), lakA (la), kúŋzA, phiča, ši, wačhíŋ, -yA, -khiyA\"\n\n\nThe \"iŋ\"-ablaut (pronounced \"i\" by some) occurs only before the following words:\n\n\"ktA\" (irrealis enclitic)\n\"yetȟó\" (familiar command enclitic)\n\"na, naháŋ\" (and)\n\"naíŋš\" (or, and or)\n\"yé\" (polite request or entreaty enclitic)\n\n\n\"Háu kȟolá\", literally \"Hello, friend\", is the most common greeting, and was transformed into the generic motion picture American Indian \"How!\", just as the traditional feathered headdress of the Teton was \"given\" to all movie Indians. As \"háu\" is the only word in Lakota which contains a diphthong, /au/, it may be a loanword from a non-Siouan language.\n\n\"Háu\" is spoken only by men; women use the greeting \"Háŋ\" or \"Háŋ kȟolá\".\n\nOther than using the word \"friend\", one often uses the word \"cousin\" or \"cross-cousin\" since everyone in the tribe was as family to each other. These words are very important to the speaker's tone of proper respect. The terms are as follow:\n\n\"Tȟaŋháŋši\" N - my male cross-cousin (man speaking, term of address)<br>\n\"Tȟaŋháŋšitku\" N - his male cross-cousin<br>\n\"TȟaŋháŋšiyA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a male cross-cousin\n\n\"Haŋkáši\" N - my female cross-cousin (man speaking, term of address)<br>\n\"Haŋkášitku\" N - his female cross-cousin<br>\n\"HaŋkášiyA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a female cross-cousin\n\n\"(S)čépȟaŋši\" N - my female cross-cousin (woman speaking, term of address)<br>\n\"(S)čépȟaŋšitku\" N - her female cross-cousin<br>\n\"(S)čépȟaŋšiyA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a female cross-cousin\n\n\"šič'éši\" N - my male cross-cousin (woman speaking, term of address)<br>\n\"šič'éšitku\" N - her male cross-cousin<br>\n\"šič'éšiyA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a male cross-cousin\n\n\"Hakátaku\" N - her brothers and male cross cousins, his sisters and female cross-cousins (i.e. relative requiring respect)<br>\n\"HakátayA\" V-CAUSATIVE - to have someone for a sibling or cross-cousin of the opposite sex\n\nAssimilating indigenous tribes into the expanding American society of the late 19th and early 20th centuries depended on suppression or full eradication of each tribe's unique language as the central aspect of its culture. Government boarding schools that separated tribal children from their parents and relatives enforced this assimilation process by corporal punishment for speaking tribal languages (Powers). The Lakota language survived this suppression. \"Lakota persisted through the recognized natural immersion afforded by daily conversation in the home, the community at reservation-wide events, even in texts written in the form of letters to family and friends. people demonstrated their cultural resilience through the positive application of spoken and written Lakota.\" (Powers)\n\nEven so, employment opportunities were based on speaking English; a Lakota who was bilingual or spoke only English was more likely to be hired. (Powers)\n\nSchools on the five Lakota reservation started offering Lakota language classes beginning in the early 1970s, but Lakota language instruction suffered very low quality primarily due to lack of linguistic and methodological background of the teachers. Positions of Lakota language teachers were filled with native Lakota speakers without teaching accreditation under the assumption that a native speaker is logically an effective teacher of the language. But for several decades Lakota instruction did not result in creating proficiency among graduates of reservation schools. Students and observers reported repeatedly that Lakota classes from elementary level all the way to college commonly involved mere rote memorization of isolated vocabulary items (usually the terms for colors, number and animals).\n\nIn the mid 1970s the situation with Lakota language instruction improved on the Rosebud Reservation where the Lakota Language and Culture department was established at the Sinte Glešká University under the chairmanship of Ben Black Bear, Jr., who promoted standardization of orthography and curricula. He employed college level textbooks and orthography developed by the Colorado University Lakota Project (CULP). A few years later Black Bear was replaced as a chair of the department by Albert White Hat who discontinued the use of the consistent phonemic orthography and the Colorado University textbooks. In 1992 White Hat published an elementary level textbook and promoted it as the only teaching material for schools of all levels in Rosebud. White Hat established his own orthography, one that is very diacritic heavy and impractical. This had a detrimental impact on the quality of instruction in Rosebud and resulted in almost complete disintegration of Lakota language teaching infrastructure in Rosebud, because school boards and administrators gradually lost trust in the effectiveness of Lakota language teachers and classes. By 2015, only one Rosebud school offered Lakota language classes and there were only 2 Lakota language teachers.\n\nLakota language classes continued to be offered between 1970s and 2000s on other Lakota reservations (Pine Ridge, Cheyenne River and Standing Rock), but the three decades did not result in developing any proficiency among students. The situation started improving gradually in early 2000’s when teacher training started to be offered to Lakota language teachers and especially after 2006 when the Lakota Summer Institute was established by the Lakota Language Consortium and the Sitting Bull College on Standing Rock. The institute offers high quality training for Lakota language teachers, educating them in Lakota linguistics and language teaching methodology. Since 2008 the institute also started offering classes for Lakota language learners.\n\nBy 2015, there has been a major improvement of Lakota language proficiency levels among students of reservation schools. This was due to teacher training available through the Lakota Summer Institute and to the adoption of consistent phonemic orthography introduced in the New Lakota Dictionary (2008) and the Lakota Grammar Handbook (2016). This orthography and the effective teaching methods enabled teachers and students for the first time to teach and learn correct pronunciation. It has been reported repeatedly that students are increasingly able to have Lakota conversations with elders. Revitalization efforts were further strengthened by the establishment of several Lakota language immersion schools (such as the Language Nest in Standing Rock and the immersion school in Oglala, Pine Ridge).\n\nOne of the most influential and consistent figures of the Lakota Language Revitalization has been Ben Black Bear, Jr., who established the Lakota Language Department at the Sįté Glešká University in 1970s. Since 2009 he has been teaching Lakota at the Lakota Summer Institute at Sitting Bull College in Standing Rock. He has been a long term board member of the Lakota Language Consortium and he co-authored the Lakota Audio Series and the Lakota Grammar Handbook, which is the most accurate grammar of the language and probably the most detailed grammar ever written for a Native American language.\n\nIn 2004 five Lakota tribes (Pine Ridge, Standing Rock, Rosebud, Cheyenne River and Lower Brule) united with second-language education professionals and academic linguists to form the Lakota Language Consortium, to produce and implement a comprehensive educational effort to standardize and professionalize Lakota language teaching in tribal and neighboring public and parochial schools. This intertribal movement has resulted in sequenced textbooks, audio materials, reference books and professional teacher trainings that create a new Lakota-centered career path. In November 2012, the incoming president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Bryan Brewer, announced that he intended \"to lead a Lakota Language Revitalization Initiative that will focus on the creation and operation of Lakota language immersion schools and identifying all fluent Lakota speakers.\" A Lakota language immersion daycare center is scheduled to open at Pine Ridge.\n\n, Lakota immersion classes are provided for children in an experimental program at Sitting Bull College on the Standing Rock Reservation, where children speak only Lakota for their first year (Powers). \n, it is estimated that about five percent of children age four to six on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation speak Lakota.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2014 Lakota speakers could upload photos with Lakota language audio descriptions at the \"LiveAndTell\" website.\n\nIn 2011, Sitting Bull College (Fort Yates, North Dakota, Standing Rock) and the University of South Dakota began degree programs to create effective Lakota language teachers. By earning a Bachelor of Arts in Education at the University of South Dakota or a Bachelor of Science in Education at Sitting Bull College, students can major in \"Lakota Language Teaching and Learning\" as part of the Lakota Language Education Action Program, or LLEAP.\n\nLLEAP is a four-year program designed to create at least 30 new Lakota language teachers by 2014, and was funded by $2.4 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Education. At the end of the initial phase, SBC and USD will permanently offer the Lakota Language Teaching and Learning degree as part of their regular undergraduate Education curriculum. The current LLEAP students' tuition and expenses are covered by the grant from the U.S. Department of Education. LLEAP is the first program of its kind, offering courses to create effective teachers in order to save a Native American language from going extinct, and potentially educate the 120,000 prospective Lakota speakers in the 21st century.\n\nIn 1990, Senator Daniel Inouye (D-HI) sponsored the Native American Languages Act in order to preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedoms of Native people in America to practice, develop and conduct business in their native language. This Act reversed over 200 years of American policy that would have otherwise eliminated the indigenous languages of the United States. This legislation gave support to tribal efforts to fund language education programs.\n\nSome resources exist for self-study of Lakota by a person with no or limited access to native speakers. Here is a collection of selected resources currently available:\n\nJust as people from different regions of countries have accents, Lakota Native Americans who speak English have some distinct speech patterns. These patterns are displayed in their grammatical sequences and can be heard through some phonological differences. These unique characteristics are also observed in Lakota youth, even those who only learned English.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1699819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1699819", "title": "Note-taking", "text": "Note-taking\n\nNote-taking (sometimes written as notetaking or note taking) is the practice of recording information captured from another source. By taking notes, the writer records the essence of the information, freeing their mind from having to recall everything. Notes are commonly drawn from a transient source, such as an oral discussion at a meeting, or a lecture (notes of a meeting are usually called minutes), in which case the notes may be the only record of the event.\nNote taking is a form of self discipline.\n\nNote-taking has been an important part of human history and scientific development. The Ancient Greeks developed hypomnema, personal records on important subjects. In the Renaissance and early modern period, students learned to take notes in schools, academies and universities, oftentimes producing beautiful volumes that served as reference works after they finished their studies. In predigital times there were many kinds of notebooks used by adults, some of which included accounting waste books, marginalia, and commonplace books. Philosopher John Locke developed an indexing system which served as a model for commonplace books; for example, it inspired another book, \"Bell’s Common-Place Book, Formed generally upon the Principles Recommended and Practised by Mr Locke\" nearly a century later. Note-taking is something that many people haven't yet noticed how much it's changed over the course of history.\n\nNote-taking is a central aspect of a complex human behavior related to information management involving a range of underlying mental processes and their interactions with other cognitive functions. The person taking notes must acquire and filter the incoming sources, organize and restructure existing knowledge structures, comprehend and write down their explanation of the information, and ultimately store and integrate the freshly processed material. The result is a knowledge representation, and a memory storage. Studies comparing the performance of students who took handwritten notes to students who typed their notes found that students who took handwritten notes performed better on examinations, hypothetically due to the deeper processing of learned material through selective rephrasing instead of word-for-word transcription which is common when typing notes.\n\nMany different formats are used to structure information and make it easier to find and to understand, later. The format of the initial record may often be informal and/or unstructured. One common format for such notes is shorthand, which can allow large amounts of information to be put on paper very quickly. Note-taking is an important skill for students, especially at the college level. Many students gain skills as they go through High School and most grasp onto the best and easiest note-taking techniques. Practice in note-taking may lead to great skills in it that may also lead to success in the future. In some contexts, such as college lectures, the main purpose of taking notes may be to implant the material in the mind; the written notes themselves being of secondary importance. Historically, note-taking was an analog process, written in notebooks, or other paper methods like Post-It notes. In the digital age, computers, tablet PCs and personal digital assistants (PDAs) are common.\n\nNote-taking is a race against time. The note taker typically is under severe time pressure, and different note-taking styles and techniques try to make the best use of time. The average rate of speech is 2–3 words per second, but the average handwriting speed as only 0.2–0.3 words per second.\n\nRegardless of the medium (paper, computer), note-taking can be broadly divided into linear and nonlinear methods, which can be combined.\n\nPeople tend to write down the most important information to prevent losing time and be ready to note subsequent information provided.\n\nIt's also always important to go over the notes you write down on a loop to easily remember any of the information you went over.\n\nLinear note-taking is the process of writing down information in the order in which you receive it. Paper is itself two-dimensional so linear notes follow the natural succession of time 1,2, and so on, beginning, middle and end. However, the human brain is thought to be multi-dimensional: the more connections one makes to current knowledge, the greater the likelihood of understanding, remembering and applying the information.\n\nOutlining is one of the most common but still one of the best note-taking systems. Notes and thoughts are organised in a structured, logical manner, reducing the time needed to edit and review, allowing a lot of information to be digested in a short period of time. Outlining is less effective for classes that involve many formulas and graphs, like mathematics or chemistry. In these situations, a system such as Cornell notes may be superior.\n\nOutlines tend to proceed down a page, using headings and bullets to structure information. A common system consists of headings that use Roman numerals, letters of the alphabet, and Arabic numerals at different levels. A typical structure would be:\n\nHowever, this sort of structure has limitations in written form since it is difficult to go back and insert more information. Adaptive systems are used for paper-and-pen insertions, such as using the reverse side of the preceding page in a spiral notebook to make insertions. Or one can simply leave large spaces in between items, to enable more material to be inserted. The above method is effective for most people, but you can be creative in making your own method. (See for more about application software that supports outlining).\n\nHowever, computerized note-taking, whether with a word processor, an outliner like Workflowy, or a digital notebook program such as OneNote, Evernote or TiddlyWiki, provides the opportunity to revise easily and add more entries or rows to the outline.\n\nNon-linear note-taking involves using mind maps and spidergrams that start with notes in the middle of a page, commonly in an oval representing the topic. Non-linear note taking may require additional sheets of paper extending the notes at the top, bottom or sides, giving an holistic overview of the information. The many types of non-linear note-taking include clustering, concept mapping, the Cornell system, idea mapping, instant replays, Ishikawa diagrams, knowledge maps, learning maps, mind mapping, model maps, the pyramid principle, semantic networks, and SmartWisdom.\n\nThis method of note taking is useful for subject matter that can be broken into categories, such as similarities, differences, date, event, impact, etc. Charting works best if students are able to identify categories and draw a table prior to the lecture. This method is also useful as an editing tool. Students may review and rewrite notes using the charting method. The method may work well for students who like to organize information neatly and who learn by recognizing patterns.\n\nMapping is one of the many forms of note-taking that employs geographic organizers and diagrams to assemble information. This specific method encourages students to continually practice and also to create flash cards because mapping method doesn't come naturally to everyone in the beginning, so practice is essential. Here, ideas are written in a tree structure, with lines connecting them together. Mind maps, also referred to as brain-storming are commonly drawn from a central point, purpose or goal in the center of the page and then branching outward to identify all the ideas connected to that goal. Colors, small graphics and symbols are often used to help to visualize the information more easily. This note-taking method is most common among visual learners and is a core practice of many accelerated learning techniques. It is also used for planning and writing essays.\n\nThis method are also for people that have a visual mindset when they take notes better on drawing pictures with different shapes and diagrams. Those who feel comfortable using this method tend to use a lot of colors in their diagrams to make them focused and concentrated in what they are writing. For instance, many who use this method might feel more focused when their teacher or professor who use a lot of colors in their power point slides since, the person themselves might like to use colors and use different colors to categorize different kinds of information.\n\nSentence note taking is simply writing down each topic as a short, simple sentence. This method works well for fast paced lesson where a lot of information is being covered. Everyone should record every new thought, fact or topic on a separate line. All information is recorded but is not organized into major and minor topics. Every new thought is written as a new line. Speed is essential, because not much thought about formatting is needed to create space for more notes. Notes can be numbered or set off with bullets showing where a new thought begins. This strategy is especially helpful when a professor or teacher asks to read the notes. It also saves the time required to formulate and write long, complex sentences.\n\nSQ3R is a method of taking notes from written material, though it might be better classed as a method of reading and gaining understanding. Material is skimmed to produce a list of headings, that are then converted into questions. These questions are then considered whilst the text is read to provide motivation for what is being covered. Notes are written under sections headed by the questions as each of the material's sections is read. One then makes a summary from memory, and reviews the notes. (SQ3R—Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review.). However, there is another updated version called SQ4R, which has been used by students since the early 60's. It's probably worth your time to try the steps first, then choose and apply only those that really work effectively. It provides a systematic way of comprehending and studying the content that is being spoken. Now students are able to monitor their own comprehension through review. Current research shows that students who use the SQ3R strategy retain more information and achieve higher test scores.\n\nSometimes lecturers may provide handouts of guided notes, which provide a \"map\" of the lecture content with key points or ideas missing. Students then fill in missing items as the lecture progresses. Guided notes may assist students in following lectures and identifying the most important ideas from a lecture. This format provides students with a framework, yet requires active listening (as opposed to providing copies of power point slides in their entirety), and promotes active engagement during lecture or independent reading, provide full and accurate notes for use as a study guide, helping the student to identify the most important information covered. Research suggests that guided notes improve student recording of critical points in lecture, as well as quiz scores on related content. In addition, an investigation carried out on students with learning problems showed that the use of the guided notes is an effective strategy to improve the performance of these students.\n\nThe growing ubiquity of laptops in universities and colleges has led to a rise in electronic note-taking. Many students write their notes in word processors or prepare digital hand-written notes using a graphics tablet or tablet computer and styli or digital pens, with the aid of note-taking software. Online applications are receiving growing attention from students who can forward notes using email, or otherwise make use of collaborative features in these applications and can also download the texts as a file (txt, rtf...) in a local computer. It has also become common for lecturers to deliver lectures using these and similar technologies, including electronic whiteboards, especially at institutes of technology.\n\nOnline note-taking has created problems for teachers who must balance educational freedom with copyright and intellectual property concerns regarding course content.\n\nElectronic note-taking has shown ineffectiveness when compared to traditional methods of note-taking. A study done by Pam A. Mueller of Princeton University and Daniel M. Oppenheimer of the University of California have shown that students who take notes digitally against students who take notes on paper retain less information and have difficulties remembering what they've typed down. Electronic note-taking has created computer-aided distractions in class as multitasking on laptops is very easy to accomplish. However these researches are only about typing notes on laptops, not writing on tablets.\n\nLaptops are usually a controlled device in classrooms and students may or not be able to take notes on their digital devices when required.\n\nThe Cornell Method is a systematical structure that help organize your notes, actively involve you in the creation of knowledge, improve your study expertness, and lead to academic success. The Cornell method of taking notes was developed by Dr. Walter Pauk of Cornell University in 1940's. This effective system for taking notes was made prestigious by Pauk's best selling book \"How To Study In College\" and is commonly used at many universities today. The Cornell method consists of dividing a single page into three sections: Notes, Cues and a Summary, its own system is characterized by a right hand column for notes, a left hand column for provoking key words or some type of questions that might help remember key aspects of the topic. Cornell Method also help students worldwide combat the effects of forgetting, which can be instantaneous and complete. It is recommended to read the notes at least 3 times in order for the content to sink in. Otherwise, with time it will be forgotten.

Professional Notetakers most frequently work in colleges and universities, but are also used in workplace meetings, appointments, conferences, and training sessions. They are usually educated to degree level. In the UK they are increasingly expected to have a professional note-taking qualification, such as that offered by the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People (CACDP). Professional freelance notetakers can also be supplied by transcription services companies, such as Take Note\n\n\n\nTake Note Typing, Professional Notetaking & Transcription Services \n"}

Sexual inversion was believed to be an inborn reversal of gender traits: male inverts were, to a greater or lesser degree, inclined to traditionally female pursuits and dress and vice versa. The sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing described female sexual inversion as \"the masculine soul, heaving in the female bosom\". In its emphasis on gender role reversal, the theory of sexual inversion resembles transgender, which did not yet exist as a separate concept at the time.\n\nInitially confined to medical texts, the concept of sexual inversion was given wide currency by Radclyffe Hall's 1928 lesbian novel \"The Well of Loneliness\", which was written in part to popularize the sexologists' views. Published with a foreword by the sexologist Havelock Ellis, it consistently used the term \"invert\" to refer to its protagonist, who bore a strong resemblance to one of Krafft-Ebing's case studies.\n\nAccording to this theory, gay men and lesbians were sexual \"inverts\", people who appeared physically male or female on the outside, but felt internally that they were of the \"opposite\" anatomical sex (according to the binary view of gender). Therefore, same-gender desires and attraction were explained as \"latent heterosexuality\", and bisexual desire was known as \"psychosexual hermaphroditism\" – in other words, gay men and lesbians were really just heterosexuals who were \"born in the wrong body\", and \"bisexuals\" were what modern-day sexologists would call intersexuals (formerly \"hermaphrodites\") by this theory (the bisexual person's \"male\" part supposedly has attractions towards females, and the \"female\" part have attractions towards males). The theory fails to explain though the attraction of a \"male\" part towards males.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13285876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13285876", "title": "Statement analysis", "text": "Statement analysis\n\nStatement analysis, also called scientific content analysis (SCAN), is a technique for analyzing the words people use to try to determine if what they said is accurate. Proponents claim this technique can be used to detect concealed information, missing information, and whether the information that person has provided is true or false.\n\nProponents say statement analysis has proven effective as a police interrogation technique, but critics argue that it has not been subjected to objective analysis, with most of the studies failing to have used any outside criteria to confirm whether the statements were actually true or false. As it has not been proven experimentally and is generally unaccepted by courts, skeptics call it an example of pseudoscience.\n\nRelated to statement analysis is a different technique for analyzing the words people use called \"statement validity assessment\" (SVA). The SVA is a tool that was originally designed to determine the credibility of child witnesses testimonies in trials for sexual offences. The \"criteria-based content analysis\" (CBCA) is a core component of the SVA and is a tool used to distinguish true statements from false statements as CBCA scores are expected to be higher for truth tellers than liars. A qualitative review of the CBCA analyzed 37 studies, strong support for the tool was established as truth tellers obtained significantly higher CBCA scores compared to the liars. More recently, a meta-analytic review found CBCA criteria to be a valid technique for discriminating between memories of real self-experienced events and invented or false accounts.\n\nCountries such as Holland, Germany and Sweden use these techniques as scientific evidence in court. However, countries such as the United States, Canada and the UK do not consider these techniques as legally valid evidence in court. Studies have raised serious questions and concerns about the validity of CBCA for assessing the credibility of children's testimonies. One study using 114 children showed that CBCA scores were higher for the group of children describing a familiar event compared to the group of children describing an unfamiliar event. The potential influence of familiarity on CBCA scores raises concerns about the validity of the tool for assessing credibility in children.\n\nIt has also been noted that the error rate of CBCA in the laboratory is high, that the error rate of SVA in practice is unknown and that the methodology continues to be disputed among the scientific community. In conclusion, there is still great controversy surrounding the use of the SVA and many studies have investigated its core component, the CBCA, in order to determine its validity and reliability. More research is needed to conclude whether or not the information obtained from these tests should be admissible in court.\n\nStatement analysis involves an investigator searching for linguistic cues and gaps in a subject's testimony or preliminary statements. Ideally, the technique would guide investigators to ask follow-up questions to uncover discrepancies. The creator of Scientific Content Analysis (SCAN), Avinoam Sapir, gives the example of someone saying, \"I counted the money, put the bag on the counter, and proceeded to go home.\" Sapir says the statement was literally true:\n\nHe counted the money (when you steal you want to know how much you are stealing), and then the subject put the bag on the counter. The subject didn't say that he put the money back in the bag after counting it, because he didn't; he left the empty bag on the counter and walked away with the money.\n\nSapir says that a fundamental principle of statement analysis is that \"denying guilt is not the same as denying the act. When one says 'I am not guilty' or 'I am innocent,' they are not denying the act; they are only denying guilt.\" Sapir claims that it is almost impossible for a guilty person to say \"I didn't do it.\" He asserts that guilty people tend to speak in even greater circumlocutions by saying things like \"I had nothing to do with it\" or \"I am not involved in that\".\n\nAldert Vrij, one of the leading authorities on detection of deception (DOD) techniques, points out that most studies of the technique did not rely on the ground truth being established and thus examiners could not be certain if \"examinees were actually telling the truth or lying\". He also notes that there is no standardization among the different methods of analysis and this \"implies that much depends on the subjective interpretation and skill of the individual\" performing the analysis. Vrij attributes this to an absence of theoretical underpinning behind SCAN/statement analysis. Vrij characterizes SCAN/statement analysis as weaker than CBCA because SCAN/statement analysis lacks \"a set of cohesive criteria\", being instead \"a list of individual criteria\". Vrij argues that SCAN/statement analysis is best used as a technique to guide investigative interviews rather than as a \"lie detection tool\".\n\nCritics argue that the technique encourages investigators to prejudge a suspect as deceptive and affirm a presumption of guilt before the interrogation process has even begun. Statement analysis in general has been criticized as \"theoretically vague\" with little or no empirical evidence in its favor, and SCAN in particular has been characterized as \"junk science\" \nwith the \"Skeptic's Dictionary\" and \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine classifying it as a form of pseudoscience.\n\n\n"}

The term was introduced in the 1930s by the linguist Leonard Bloomfield, who defined it as the smallest meaningful unit of grammatical form (analogous to the morpheme, defined as the smallest meaningful unit of lexical form). The term was later adopted, and its meaning broadened, by Kenneth Pike and others beginning in the 1950s, as the basis for their tagmemics.\n\nAccording to the scheme set out by Leonard Bloomfield in his book \"Language\" (1933), the tagmeme is the smallest meaningful unit of grammatical form. A tagmeme consists of one or more taxemes, where a taxeme is a primitive grammatical feature, in the same way that a phoneme is a primitive phonological feature. Taxemes and phonemes do not as a rule have meaning on their own, but combine into tagmemes and morphemes respectively, which carry meaning.\n\nFor example, an utterance such as \"John runs\" exemplifies a tagmeme whose meaning is that an actor performs an action. The taxemes making up this tagmeme include the selection of a nominative expression, the selection of a finite verb expression, and the ordering of the two such that the nominative expression precedes the finite verb expression.\n\nBloomfield makes the taxeme and tagmeme part of a system of emic units, as follows:\n\nMore generally, he defines any meaningful unit of linguistic signaling (not necessarily smallest) as a \"linguistic form\", and its meaning as a \"linguistic meaning\"; it may be either a \"lexical form\" (with a \"lexical meaning\") or a \"grammatical form\" (with a \"grammatical meaning\").\n\nBloomfield's term was adopted by Kenneth Pike and others to denote what they had previously been calling the \"grammeme\" (earlier \"grameme\"). In Pike's approach, consequently called \"tagmemics\", the hierarchical organization of levels (e.g. in syntax: word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, discourse) results from the fact that the elements of a tagmeme on a higher level (e.g. 'sentence') are analyzed as syntagmemes on the next lower level (e.g. 'phrase').\n\nThe tagmeme is the correlation of a syntagmatic function (e.g. subject, object) and paradigmatic fillers (e.g. nouns, pronouns or proper nouns as possible fillers of the subject position). Tagmemes combine to form a syntagmeme: a syntactic construction consisting of a sequence of tagmemes.\n\nTagmemics as a linguistic methodology was developed by Pike in his book \"Language in Relation to a Unified Theory of the Structure of Human Behavior\", 3 vol. (1954–1960). It was primarily designed to assist linguists to efficiently extract coherent descriptions out of corpora of fieldwork data. Tagmemics is particularly associated with the Summer Institute of Linguistics, an association of missionary linguists devoted largely to Bible translations, of which Pike was an early member.\n\nTagmemics makes the kind of distinction made between phone and phoneme in phonology and phonetics at higher levels of linguistic analysis (grammatical and semantic); for instance, contextually conditioned synonyms are considered different instances of a single tagmeme, as sounds which are (in a given language) contextually conditioned are allophones of a single phoneme. The emic and etic distinction also applies in other social sciences.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53847870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53847870", "title": "Tirukkural translations into Malayalam", "text": "Tirukkural translations into Malayalam\n\nMalayalam has seen the most number of Tirukkural translations than that of any other language in India. As of 2007, there are at least 21 translations of the Kural text available in Malayalam. Malayalam also has the distinction of producing the first ever translation of the Kural text among the languages in India and the world at large. The Annual Report of the Cochin Archeological Department for the year 1933–34 reported an unpublished manuscript of a Malayalam translation of the Tirukkural made in 1595.\n\nMalayalam translations of the Kural text range from old Malayalam to modern Malayalam. With the Malayalam language tracing its origin in old Tamil, both old Malayalam and modern Malayalam have a rich vocabulary of both Tamil and Sanskrit origin. Kerala had a long and enduring connection with the Tamil region and culture since antiquity, which flourished during the Chera Dynasty. For centuries, Tamil remained the educational and administrative language of Kerala, with Malayalam being the language of the common people. The salutary influence of the Tamil literature on early Malayalam literature was more pronounced during the 12th and the 13th centuries, with the \"pattu\" style of literature being a significant example of this influence. Until the 19th century, educated people of Kerala studied Tamil as a second language, and scholars had studied important Tamil classics such as the Tirukkural, Chilappathikaram, and Kamba Ramayanam. However, these were considered as part of the common heritage, and there was no serious attempt to translate these into Malayalam, until at least the late 16th century.\n\nThe first Malayalam translation of the Kural text, and the very first translation of the Kural text into any language, appeared in 1595. Written by an unknown author, it was titled \"Tirukkural Bhasha\" and was a prose rendering of the entire Kural, written closely to the spoken Malayalam of that time. However, the manuscript remained unpublished and was first reported by the Annual Report of the Cochin Archeological Department for the year 1933–34. This has not been printed. The first modern translation appeared in 1875 when the work was translated in verse by Azhakathu Kurup and published in Trivandrum. In 1899, a translation was published by Dewan Bahadur A. Govinda Pillai, a judge of the erstwhile Travancore State High Court. He was a translator and versifier who had translated Shakespearean works into Malayalam. This translation is not available now.\n\nIn 1957, two translations of the Kural were published in Malayalam. The first one was by Sasthamangalam Ramakrishna Pillai of Trivandrum. Although he completed the translation with a comprehensive commentary and notes in 1933, he published it only in September 1957 with abridged commentary under the title \"Ramakrishna Tirukkural.\" Ramakrishna chose a short metre similar to the original Kural, reflecting the epigrammatic qualities of the original. The second one was by Malayalam poet Vennikkulam Gopala Kurup, who started studying the Kural 25 years ago and learning Tamil in the process, and translated the work with the help of Pandit E. V. Raman Nambudiri of the Oriental Manuscript Library, Trivandrum. The completed work with commentary was published in December 1957 by the Writers Co-operative Society in Kottayam. Unlike Ramakrishna Pillai, who translated the Kural in a \"tight verse\" form, Vennikkulam Kurup employed three different metres for the three parts, making it more comprehensive to the average reader without the aid of a commentary.\n\nSeveral translations started appearing ever since, both partial and complete, including those by P. Damodaran Pillai (1951), Tiruvallam G. Bhaskaran Nair (1962), K. Chellan Nadar (1962), G. Balakrishnan Nair (1963), M. R. R. Variar (2003), Ramesan Nair (in old Malayalam), V. V. Abdulla Sahib (2002, verse translation), K. G. Chandrasekaran Nair (2003, prose translation), and Shailaja Ravindran (2007).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "740093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=740093", "title": "Tlingit language", "text": "Tlingit language\n\nThe Tlingit language (; \"Lingít\" ) is spoken by the Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska and Western Canada. It is a branch of the Na-Dene language family. Extensive effort is being put into revitalization programs in Southeast Alaska to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and culture.\n\nMissionaries of the Russian Orthodox Church were the first to develop a written version of Tlingit, using the Cyrillic script to record and translate it, when the Russian Empire had contact with Alaska and the coast of North America down to Sonoma County, California. After the Alaska Purchase, English-speaking missionaries from the United States developed a written version of the language using the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe history of Tlingit is poorly known, mostly because there is no written record until the first contact with Europeans around the 1790s. Documentation was sparse and irregular until the early 20th century. The language appears to have spread northward from the Ketchikan–Saxman area towards the Chilkat region, since certain conservative features are reduced gradually from south to north. The shared features between the Eyak language, found around the Copper River delta, and Tongass Tlingit near the Portland Canal are all the more striking for the distances that separate them, both geographic and linguistic.\n\nTlingit is currently classified as a distinct and separate branch of Na-Dene, an indigenous language family of North America. Edward Sapir (1915) argued for its inclusion in the Na-Dené family, a claim which was subsequently debated by Franz Boas (1917), P.E. Goddard (1920), and many other prominent linguists of the time.\n\nStudies in the late 20th century by (Heinz-)Jürgen Pinnow (1962, 1968, 1970, int. al.) and Michael E. Krauss (1964, 1965, 1969, int. al.) showed a strong connection to Eyak and hence to the Athabaskan languages. This relationship is now widely accepted.\n\nSapir initially proposed a connection between Tlingit and Haida, but the debate over Na-Dene gradually excluded Haida from the discussion. Haida is now considered an isolate with some borrowing through long proximity with Tlingit. In 2004, the Haida linguist John Enrico presented new arguments and reopened the debate. Victor Golla writes in his 2011 \"California Native Languages\", \"John Enrico, the contemporary linguist with the deepest knowledge of Haida, continues to believe that a real, if distant, genetic relationship connects Haida to Na-Dene[.]\"\n\nThe Tlingit language is distributed from near the mouth of the Copper River down the open coast of the Gulf of Alaska and throughout almost all of the islands of the Alexander Archipelago in Southeast Alaska. It is characterized by four or five distinct but mostly mutually intelligible dialects, for which see below. Almost all of the area where the Tlingit language is endemic is contained within the modern borders of Alaska.\n\nThe exception is an area known as \"Inland Tlingit\" that extends up the Taku River and into northern British Columbia and the Yukon around Atlin Lake (\"Áa Tleen\" \"Big Lake\") and Teslin Lake (\"Desleen\" < \"Tas Tleen\" \"Big Thread\") lake districts, as well as a concentration around Bennett Lake at the end of the Chilkoot Trail (\"Jilkhoot\"). Otherwise, Tlingit is not found in Canada. Tlingit legend tells that groups of Tlingit once inhabited the Stikine, Nass, and Skeena river valleys during their migrations from the interior. There is a small group of speakers (some 85) in Washington as well.\n\nGolla (2007) reported a decreasing population of 500 speakers in Alaska. The First Peoples' Cultural Council (2014) reported 2 speakers in Canada out of an ethnic population of 400.\n\nAs of 2013, Tlingit courses are available at the University of Alaska Southeast. In April 2014, Alaska HB 216 recognized Tlingit as an official language of Alaska, lending support to language revitalization.\n\nTlingit is divided into roughly five major dialects, all of which are essentially mutually intelligible:\n\nThe various dialects of Tlingit can be classified roughly into two-tone and three-tone systems. Tongass Tlingit, however, has no tone, but a four-way register contrast between short, long, glottalized, and \"fading\" vowels. (In the last type, the onset of the vowel is articulated normally but the release is murmured, essentially a rapid opening of the glottis once articulation is begun.)\n\nThe tone values in two-tone dialects can be predicted in some cases from the three-tone values, but not the reverse. Earlier it was hypothesized that the three-tone dialects were older and that the two-tone dialects evolved from them. However, following Jeff Leer's discovery of the Tongass dialect in the late 1970s, it has been shown that the Tongass vowel system is adequate to predict the tonal features of both the two-tone and three-tone dialects, whereas none of the tonal dialects could be used to predict vocalic feature distribution in Tongass Tlingit. Thus Tongass Tlingit is the most conservative of the various dialects of Tlingit, preserving contrasts which have been lost in the other dialects.\n\nThe fading and glottalized vowels in Tongass Tlingit have also been compared with similar systems in the Coast Tsimshian dialect. But, Krauss and Leer (1981, p. 165) point out that the fading vowels in Coastal Tsimshian are the surface realization of underlying sequences of vowel and glottalized sonorant, i.e. . This is in contradistinction to the glottal modifications in Tongass Tlingit which Leer argues are symmetric with the modifications of the consonantal system. Thus a fading vowel is symmetric with an aspirated consonant , and a glottalized vowel is symmetric with an ejective (glottalized) consonant . This implies that the two systems have no familial relationship. Leer (1978) speculated that the maintenance of the pretonal system in Tongass Tlingit was caused by the proximity of its speakers around the Cape Fox area near the mouth of the Portland Canal to Coastal Tsimshian speakers just to the south.\n\nTlingit has a complex phonological system compared to Indo-European languages such as English or Spanish. It has an almost complete series of ejective consonants accompanying its stop, fricative, and affricate consonants. The only missing ejective consonant in the Tlingit series is pronounced . Tlingit is also notable for having several laterals but no voiced , and no labials in most dialects, except for and in recent English loanwords.\n\nConsonants in the popular orthography are given in the following table, with IPA equivalents in brackets. Marginal or historical phonemes are given in parentheses.\n\nThe consonant \"m\" is a variant of \"w\" found in the Interior dialect, for example in \"amsikóo\" \"(he) knew it\", which would be \"awsikóo\" in the Coastal dialects. It is not strictly an allophone as Interior speakers appear to distinguish the two; it is more likely that the distinction is allomorphic. The consonant \"ll\" is an allophone of \"n\" now mostly obsolete, but still occasionally heard among the oldest speakers, particularly in the Interior dialect. However its former allophony with \"n\" is still evident in many Tlingit loanwords where \"n\" replaces the in the source language, such as \"sgóon\" \"school\".\n\nThe consonant \"ÿ\" () has recently merged with () \"y\" or () \"w\" depending on the phonological environment, with \"w\" next to rounded vowels and labialized consonants, and \"y\" elsewhere. It shows up as a \"g\" occasionally in placenames derived from Tlingit during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as well as in some broad transcriptions by earlier anthropologists, e.g. \"Gan Gulihashee Hit\" for \"Ÿan Ÿuliháshi Hít\" \"Drifted Ashore House\" as recorded by Olson, today written \"Yan Wuliháshi Hít\". Because the use of \"y\" versus \"w\" is predictable from context where it was originally a \"ÿ\", this graph is used consistently in linguistic transcription, but not in ordinary writing. Note that this consonant has been erroneously referred to as \"gamma\", confused with the similar which is however the voiced velar fricative, not an approximant.\n\nLeer (1991) argues the existence of two labialized glottal consonants, and , which could be written in the popular orthography as \".w\" and \"hw\". The latter sound does appear in the speech of some speakers, but only in the highly variable word \"oohwaan\" (\"first person plural independent pronoun\"). This particular word is also pronounced (and hence spelled) \"oohaan\", \"hoowaan\", and \"oowaan\" among other variations. The labialized glottal stop is not attested in any Tlingit transcriptions or recordings, although speakers seem to be able to produce it when requested.\n\nNasal consonant assimilation with and the velar and uvular plosives is common among Tlingit speakers of all dialects. For example, the sequence \"nk\" () is often heard as and \"nkh\" () as . Native speakers in a teaching position may admonish learners when they produce these assimilated forms, deriding them as \"not Tlingit\" or \"too English\", but it is not uncommon to later hear the speakers producing these forms themselves. It is uncertain whether this assimilation is autochthonous or if it arose from contact with English, although the former is more likely from a purely articulatory perspective.\n\nYoung speakers and second language learners of Tlingit are increasingly making a voiced/unvoiced distinction between consonants rather than the traditional unaspirated/aspirated distinction. This is due to the influence of English and its similar distinction. For speakers which make the voiced/unvoiced distinction the distribution is symmetrical with the unaspirated/aspirated distinction among other speakers.\n\nMaddieson, Smith, and Bessel (2001) note that all word final non-ejective stops are phonemically unaspirated. This contrasts with the orthography which typically represents them as aspirated stops, e.g. \"t\" for the more accurate \"d\" . There is wide variation in ordinary speech, ranging from unreleased to a very delayed aspiration . However the underlying phoneme is certainly unaspirated because it is consistently produced when the word is suffixed. The orthography usually but not always reflects this, for example \"hít\" \"house\" is written \"(du) hídi\" \"(his) house\" when marked with the possessive suffix \"-ÿí\". It is possible that aspirated and unaspirated stops are collapsed into a single phoneme word-finally, however this has not been verified.\n\nMaddieson and colleagues also confirm that the ejective fricatives in Tlingit are in fact true ejectives. This is counter to the widely held assumption that ejective fricatives are not actually phonetically ejective, but are instead produced as a sequence of fricative and glottal stop. In Tlingit, at least, the articulation of ejective fricatives does include complete closure of the glottis before frication begins, and the larynx is raised in the same manner as with ejective stops. Characteristically, the ejective fricatives in Tlingit feature a much smaller aperture for frication than what is found in ordinary fricatives. This articulation provides increased resistance to counter the continual loss of dynamic airstream pressure. In addition, ejective fricatives appear to include tightening of the pharyngeal muscles which reduces the diameter of the air column and thus further increases pressure. This pharyngeal constriction is not true pharyngealization, however, since the diameter is still greater than that found in pharyngealized consonants in other languages.\n\nTlingit has eight vowels, four vowels further distinguished formally by length. However, the length distinction is often in terms of tenseness rather than length, particularly in rapid speech. For the Northern dialect, the dominant spoken dialect of Tlingit and the standard for written Tlingit, every vowel may take either high or low tone; in the orthography high tone is indicated by an acute accent, e.g. \"áa\", and low tone is unmarked, e.g. \"aa\". The Southern and Transitional dialects have a mid tone which is unmarked and additional low tone which is marked by a grave accent, e.g. \"àa\".\n\nAs noted in the vowel chart above, there is an allophone of (orthographic \"aa\") which is realized as under the influence of uvular consonants, however this is not consistent for all speakers. The backness influence arises from articulation with uvular consonants, thus the word \"kháa\" \"person\" is often spoken as , whereas the word \"(a) káa\" \"on (its) surface\" is said as by the same speakers.\n\nWord onset is always consonantal in Tlingit, i.e. no word may begin with a vowel. Where one would occur theoretically by e.g. prefixing or compounding, the vowel is obligatorily preceded by either or . The former is universal in single words, and the latter is found varying with in word-medial position in compounds. The orthography does not reflect the in word-initial position, but either \".\" or \"y\" may be seen in medial position. For example, the word \"khoowat'áa\" \"the weather is hot\" (\"khu-ÿu-ÿa-t'áa\", --(0, -D, +I)-hot) is phonetically , but when the perfective prefix \"ÿu-\" is word initial in \"uwat'áa\" \"it is hot\" (\"0-ÿu-ÿa-t'áa\", 3--(0, -D, +I)-hot) the phonetic form is where the glottal stop appears to ensure that the word begins with a consonant.\n\nUntil the late 1960s, Tlingit was written exclusively in phonetic transcription in the works of linguists and anthropologists, except for a little known Cyrillic alphabet used for publications by the Russian Orthodox Church. A number of amateur anthropologists doing extensive work on the Tlingit had no training in linguistics whatsoever and left numerous samples in vague and inconsistent transcriptions, the most famous being George T. Emmons. However, such noted anthropologists as Franz Boas, John R. Swanton, and Frederica de Laguna have transcribed Tlingit in various related systems which feature accuracy and consistency, though sacrificing readability.\n\nTwo problems ensue from the multiplicity of transcription systems used for Tlingit. One is that there are many of them, thus requiring any reader to learn each individual system depending on what sources are used. The second problem is that most transcriptions made before Franz Boas's study of Tlingit have numerous mistakes in them, particularly because of misinterpretations of the short vowels and ejective consonants. Thus it is important to check any given transcription against similar words in other systems, or ideally against a modern work postdating Naish and Story's work in the 1960s.\n\nTlingit grammar at first glance appears to be highly fusional, but this is an incorrect assumption. There are predictable processes by which the basic phonetic shapes of individual morphemes are modified to fit various phonological requirements. These processes can be described with a regular language, and such descriptions are given here on a per morpheme basis by giving rule schemas for the context sensitive phonological modification of base morphemes. Analyzing all the possible combinations of morphemes and phonological contexts in Tlingit and constructing a regular language to describe them is a daunting but tractable task.\n\nDespite not being a fusional language, Tlingit is still highly synthetic as an agglutinating language, and is even polysynthetic to some extent. The verb, as with all the Na-Dené languages, is characteristically incorporating. Nouns are in comparison relatively simple, with many being derived from verbs.\n\nTlingit word order is SOV when non-pronominal agent and object phrases both exist in the sentence. However, there is a strong urge to restrict the argument of the verb phrase to a single non-pronominal noun phrase, with any other phrases being extraposed from the verb phrase. If a noun phrase occurs outside of the verb phrase then it is typically represented in the verb phrase by an appropriate pronoun.\n\nTlingit has a complex system of pronominals, which vary depending on their relationship to the verb. The subject pronominals are incorporated into the verb in its subject slot. The object pronominals are also technically incorporated into the verb (i.e. the verb \"complex\"), but most are graphically independent. They are divided into three classes, the verbal object, nominal object, and postpositional object. There are also the independent pronominals which are completely separate from the verb and can be used in dependent clauses or in subject or object position.\n\nThe pronominals all have related semantic values, and their organization can hence easily be visualized in a table.\n\nThe numbers in the first column represent the usual concept of person, i.e. first, second, or third. Story and Naish identified a fourth person, but this term is inappropriate since they did not describe a clear separation between the so-called fourth person and the other impersonal pronominals.\n\nWhen analyzing a sentence, the pronominal type is given first, then the form (subject, object, independent) is given following a period. This uniquely represents the pronominal as a two dimensional unit. Thus 1 is the first person singular subject pronominal, realized as \"xhat\". The does not uniquely identify one of the two reciprocal pronominals, but since they are both phonetically identical as \"woosh\", it is generally unnecessary to uniquely identify them.\n\nThere is also a notional zeroth person which can be of subject, object, or independent form. This is not realized in Tlingit, instead it is an empty placeholder for analysis.\n\nThe subject pronominals are all incorporated into the verb. Thus when the subject is represented as a pronominal, the subject position of the sentence is empty.\n\nObject pronominals are divided into three classes, the verbal, nominal, and postpositional.\n\nThe verbal object pronominals function similarly to the subject pronominals in that they preclude an explicit object when used.\n\nThe nominal object pronominals are similar in some respects to the possessive pronouns of English. They precede a noun and represent the object of the noun, typically implying possession of the noun.\n\nPostpositional object pronominals function as objects to which postpositions are attached. They act as the object of a postposition in a manner similar to an ordinary noun suffixed with a postposition.\n\nStrictly speaking, the Tlingit directionals can be classified as nouns on the basis of their syntactic function. However, they form a distinct semantic set of nouns which indicate direction relative to some stated position. They also show stem variation depending locative suffixation, in particular with the allative suffix \"-dei\". These stem variants also occur with the adverb construction \"N\"-da-\"N\"-(i)n \"\"N\" \"N\"-ward\" where \"N\" is an anatomic noun and \"N\" is a directional stem.\n\nParticles function as neither noun nor verb. They are restricted to positions relative to phrases in the sentence.\n\nThe focus particles are particles which follow the left periphery (\"forephrase\" per Leer) of a sentence. The Naish-Story term for them is \"post-marginals\". Many may be suffixed with a demonstrative (\"-yá\", \"-hé\", \"-wé\", \"-yú\"), also they may be combined with the interrogative (\"-gé\"). Focus particles are stylistically written as separate words, although phonetically they may be indivisible from the preceding utterance.\n\n\nThe combination of the focus \"á\" with the demonstratives gives the frequently used particles \"áyá\" and \"áwé\", and the less common \"áhé\" and \"áyú\". Combination of the interrogative \"ágé\" with the demonstratives gives the confirmative particles \"ákwé\" and \"ákyá\" (\"ák-hé\" and \"ákyú\" are uncommon), used to elicit a yes/no response from the listener.\n\nThe interrogative \"ágé\" also usually contracts to \"ág\" before \"tsú\" \"also\", e.g. \"ág tsú\" \"also?\" < \"ágé\" + \"tsú\".\n\nThe particle \"sá\" is obligatory in forming wh-question phrases. It can be combined with a demonstrative, with the dubitative, the rhetorical interrogative, and the emphatic assertion, as in the list below.\n\n\nPhrasal particles may occur after focus particles that occur with or without demonstrative finals. The following are postphrasal particles, thus they may only occur after the phrase that they modify.\n\n\nExcept for \"x'wán\" and \"tsé\", the above may occur after the focus particles.\n\nThe following are prephrasal particles, i.e. they occur before the phrase that they modify. Naish and Story call these \"pre-marginals\".\n\n\nThese particles may occur before or after any phrase in a clause.\n\n\nCompare the mobile particle \"tsu\" with the postphrasal particle \"tsú\". Both the sentence \"káaxwei tsu eetéenaxh xhat yatee\" \"I need more coffee\" and the sentence \"káaxwei tsú eetéenaxh xhat yatee\" \"I also need coffee\" are acceptable. However the sentence \"*tsú káaxwei eetéenaxh xhat yatee\" is syntactically inadmissible because the particle \"tsú\" is postphrasal, i.e. it cannot precede the phrase it modifies, in this case the noun phrase \"káaxwei\". The corresponding sentence with the \"tsu\" particle in front, \"tsu káaxwei eetéenaxh xhat yatee\" \"I need coffee again/still\" is in contrast syntactically acceptable. Thus a Tlingit listener will recognize the \"tsu\" particle in a phrase-initial position without confusion but tone is necessary to distinguish it in a phrase-final position. For this reason the \"tsu\" particle is often used prephrasally although it is syntactically admitted in either position. Thus the song name \"Tsu Héidei Shugaxhtootaan\" could also be \"héidei tsu shugaxhtootaan\", but placing the \"tsu\" in front has the advantage of unambiguity, and thus seems more euphonious to native speakers.\n\nNote that \"déi\" is a homonym with the noun \"déi\" \"path, way, road\". [How are these differentiated in speech?]\n\nThe particle \"tlei\" is easily confused with \"tléil\" \"no, not\", but as with the \"tsu/tsú\" pair the tone makes them unambiguous.\n\nThese particles may only occur at the front of a sentence. Naish-Story term these \"clause marginals\".\n\n\nThe Irish TV series \"An Klondike\" (2015–17), set in Canada in the 1890s, contains Tlingit dialog.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24480974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24480974", "title": "Yun Chi-ho", "text": "Yun Chi-ho\n\nYun Chi-ho (Korean: 윤치호, hanja: 尹致昊, 1864 – 1945) was an important political activist and thinker during the late 1800s and early 1900s in Joseon Korea. His penname was Jwa-ong (좌옹, 佐翁); his courtesy name was Sungheum (성흠;聖欽), Sungheum (성흠;成欽). a member of Korean early NGO's Independence Club (독립협회;獨立協會) and People's joint association (만민공동회;萬民共同會), Shinminhwae (신민회;新民會). He was a strong nationalist especially in his early years; pushing for reform and modernization in the Joseon government. He was involved in important organizations such as the Independence Club led by Seo Jae-pil. He also served in various government positions and was a strong supporter of Christianity in Korea.\n\nAlthough Yun's early years were filled with strong support of patriotic and nationalist movements, there seemed to have been a change in Yun’s approach to Korean independence in the wake of the Japanese dominance in Korea, starting with Korea becoming a protectorate of Japan in 1904, and then fully annexed into the Japanese Empire in 1910. Because of Yun’s apparent change in attitude toward Korean independence and his lack of support of nationalist movements, like the 1919 Samil Movement, many Koreans today see him as a collaborator with the Japanese.\n\nYun Chi-ho was a member of one of the prominent \"yangban\" families of Korea. Son of General Yun Ung-nyeol, who served as a minister in the Joseon government. he attended Vanderbilt University in Tennessee before transferring to Emory University in Georgia. He was also an early leader of the Korean YMCA and a South Korean Methodist.\n\nYun Chi-ho was born on December 26, 1864 in a small village in Dunpo-myeon, Asan, Chungcheong Province. His father, Yun Ung-yeol, was an official in the Joseon government and as a member of the yangban aristocracy saw that Chi-ho received a proper education. Yun Chi-ho excelled in his studies of the Confucian classics at the local seodang and even tried to apply to take the civil-service exams (gwageo) at age twelve.\n\nYun's family was one of Joseon dynasty's most illustrious noble families; his 9G-Great grandfather Yun Doo-su (윤두수;尹斗壽) was Yeonguijeong under King Seonjo. But his father Yun Ung-ryeol was an illegitimate son of his grandfather Yun Chui-dong (윤취동;尹取東).\n\nFrom 1871 to 1878, Yun studied Confucianism at Chang's private village school.\n\nBecause of Yun Ung-yeol’s position in the government, he was able to arrange for Yun Chi-ho’s participation in a delegation of representatives from Korea to observe the process of modernization in Japan in 1881. Yun was only sixteen years old at the time, but this experience greatly influenced his thoughts on modernization and opened his eyes to world beyond the isolated “Hermit Kingdom” that Korea had become. He frequently compared the lack of progress in Joseon Korea to the rapid modernization of Japan and often lamented in his diaries that he wanted nothing more than for Korea to become the kind of advanced, modern nation that Japan had become.\n\nYun would later travel to Shanghai, China in 1885 where he would attend the Anglo-Chinese College studying English and mathematics, among other things. While in Shanghai he also converted to Christianity, something that would play a major role throughout the rest of his life. Yun Chi-ho viewed Christianity as a strong progressive philosophy that could help Korea catch up with the advancements of Japan and the West.\n\nHe eventually even studied in America, starting in 1888 at Vanderbilt University and then Emory University. He strongly admired many aspects of American culture, but was also frustrated with the racial prejudices he experienced while living in the South. In particular, he would identify tensions and contradictions between Christian universalism, and the belief that any individual could earn respect and equality as long as they were pious, and the arbitrary demonstrations of white supremacy that he routinely witnessed and experienced. While in America he studied English, theology and speech and he gained a great deal of proficiency in the English language; writing most of his diaries in English.\n\nYun served in several important government positions throughout his life. He served as an interpreter for the first American Foreign Minister in Korea, Lucius Foote. Upon arriving in Korea Foote had inquired to the Japanese Foreign Minister Inoue Kaoru about finding someone to interpret for him while in Seoul, and Minister Inoue, who knew Yun Chi-ho from his days in Japan, recommended Yun to help serve Minister Foote. It was also Foote who helped Yun with arranging his studies in Shanghai.\n\nYun also served as the Vice President of the Privy Council of the Joseon Court from 1898 until he was banished in 1899 due to pressure from opposing factions in the government. While banished to the countryside, Yun served as magistrate for a town called Wonsan in Northern Korea. His banishment was not long lived and in 1903 he was called to serve as the Vice Foreign Minister.\n\nWhen Yun arrived back in Korea from his studies abroad, there were small groups of scholars who were beginning to call for social and political reform in Korea. One such group was the Independence club, which Yun began to participate in. Among other things, the club promoted educating the Korean people on their unique history, promoted the use of Hangeul, the Korean vernacular alphabet, and pushed for government reform. While in the Independence Club Yun called for the government to be more representative of its people and even supported the elevation of King Kojong to the title of Gwangmu Emperor. Eventually the group was met with pressure from opposing factions in the government that believed the club was gaining too much influence and so in 1899, the club disbanded.\n\nAs Japanese influence on the Korean peninsula began to tighten, Yun also began to support groups that were part of the Enlightenment movement. These groups, such as the Korean Self-Strengthening Society and the New People’s Society, were picking up the pieces where the independence club had left off, and Yun Chi-ho helped them out by giving speeches and writing pamphlets for them. During his time of Banishment, these groups gave Yun something to work for in the hopes of creating a stronger Korean society.\n\nFrom his early years, he was disappointed in the Joseon people for always having an emotional response and frustrated in their irrationality.\nIn January 1910, he participated in the World Missionary Conference in America and that May, he attended to Edinburgh World Missionary Conference in England. In December 1910, he returned to his country.\n\nWhen the Korean Empire was overrun by Japanese military forces in 1910 (see Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910), Yun Chi-ho joined with others in resisting Japanese occupation. He became an anti-Imperialist speaker and independence activist. In 1911, he was Judgment for alleged assassination of the Governor General of Korea. He suffered from malicious punishment and torture as a result of the 105-Man Incident.\n\nIn 1913, along with 104 others, he was charged with conspiracy against the Japanese Governor-General at the time, Count Terauchi. He was one of six who were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms. His experiences in prison tempered his willingness to express his nationalist ardor, but he was still considered active in the independence movement.\n\nIn 1911 Yun was implicated in assisting with an assassination attempt on Japanese governor-general, Terauchi Masatake. Sources from within some of the Enlightenment Movement groups that Yun had taken part in had informed Japanese officials that he had a hand in planning this attempted assassination. He was put on trial and given the maximum sentence. However, after a series of retrials his sentence was shortened and he eventually gained amnesty after only six years in jail. During this time, he didn’t write down anything in his diaries, but his experience in the Japanese prison system seemed to have a significant effect on his actions after his release. In fact, his release can be seen as a turning point for Yun Chi-ho where he began to make many pro-Japanese statements and gives much less support to Korean nationalistic movements.\n\nInspired by Woodrow Wilson’s idea of “self-determination” presented at the Paris Peace Conference the previous year, on March 1, 1919 many Koreans took to the streets in a peaceful protest to demonstrate that Korea was ready for independence from Japan. Yun knew that the European nations would not take this demonstration seriously. Yun said the following about the movement:\n“He who buys a field and keeps it from falling into irredeemable hands is a wiser patriot than he who sells his lands to finance the independent movement. He who sends a poor boy to school to become more intelligent than his fathers is doing a greater service than he who stirs up students for political agitations. He who leads an erring man into decent religious life is serving the Korean race better than he who sends ignorant folks to jail for yelling ‘mansei.’ Now is the time for Koreans to learn and wait.”\n\nYun’s reversal in opinion took an even larger turn from his previous nationalistic rhetoric when he began supporting the Japanese war efforts during WWII. He urged the young men of Korea to help the Japanese to victory by assisting in the war effort. He celebrated as the Japanese pushed Western imperialist powers out of Asia. According to Yun the Korean people’s part in the Japanese Empire them opportunity and access to education and resources they previously never had. Yun said, “The intellectuals of Korea today all realize that destiny of the Korean people can be promoted by becoming one with the Japanese people and that Manchuria and North China have opened up a field for the development of the Korean people never before dreamed of.”\n\nIn 1936, outbreak of 'case of Suyang club'. he was all related person personal reference, release. that thim, he was endeavor of Ahn Chang-ho's acquittal, also Ahn Chang-ho's file a petition. but refused of Japanese Government-General of Korea.

In 1940, he was come to book for reason of event absent from Japanese Government-General of Korea.\n\nIn 1939, Japanese Government-General of Koreas ordered Japanese Sōshi-kaimei. Yun was going to propose postponement of the order, because of Korean national sentiment. Japanese Government-General of Korea for that's acceptable, Japanese Government-General of Korea was next years postpones.

However, Korea achieved independence from Japanese occupation by the Surrender of Japan, he was criticized of some unspecified peoples. because late Japanese colonial rule time, he was Japanese cooperation. he was opprobrium to emotional popular, he refutation also arguments.\n\nIn October 1945, he sent two letters 'An OldMan's Ruminations' by John Hadge and Syngman Rhee, Kim Gu. He did not receive a response. In November 1945, he returned to Korea, and died GoryeoJeong in Kaesong in December. (It is alleged by some that he committed suicide, although there is no evidence to support this.) his aged 80.\n\nYun Chi-ho was the uncle of Yun Bo-seon, who was President of South Korea in 1960 and Yun Il-seon, a first Korean pathologist and anatomist.\n\n\n\n"}
