It is the language the Pollard script was designed for, and displays extensive tone sandhi. There is a high degree of literacy in Pollard among the older generation.\n\nThe standard written language, both in Pollard and in Latin script, is that of \"Shíménkǎn\" (石门坎) village in Weining County.\n\nThe A-Hmao language is a branch of the West Hmongic languages, also known as Chuanqiandian Miao (川黔滇方言: Sichuan–Guizhou–Yunnan Miao) and Western Miao, is the major branch of the Hmongic languages of China and Southeast Asia.\n\nWang Fushi (1985) grouped the Western Miao languages into eight primary divisions.\n\nThe Miao was descended from the \"Jiuli\" tribe in the period of Yan Di and Huang Di, \"Sanmiao\" in the period of Yao and Shun. \"Jiuli\" is a tribe, which lived in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River more than five thousand years ago. Then, the \"Jiuli\" tribe were defeated at the Battle of Zhuolu by the military coalition of Huang Di and Yan Di. Chiyou, the leader of the \"Jiuli\" tribe, was caught and killed by Huang Di. The rest of the \"Jiuli\" tribe retreated to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and formed \"Sanmiao\" tribe, the established Sanmiao Country. Four thousand years ago, the Huaxia tribe of the North led by Yao, Shun, and Yu had been fighting with \"Sanmiao\" for nearly one thousand years. In the end, Xiayu defeated \"Sanmiao\" Country. After defeated, one part of the \"Sanmiao\" were banished to \"Sanwei\" (the border of present provinces of Shanxi and Gansu). Then, they were forced to migrate to the southeast. After a long time of migration, they entered into the north of Sichuan, northeast of Yunnan, and northwest of Guizhou. Later, the present Western Miao was developed. The descendant of \"Sanmiao\" which stationed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Central Plains Area, one part of them merged with Huaxia tribe, and another part developed to what was called \"Nanman\" in Shang and Zhou Dynasty. While the part, which lived in the middle reaches of Han River, was called \"Jingchu barbarians\". Later, the advanced part of the \"Jingchu barbarians\" gradually developed to Chu tribe, and then Chu was developed. While the less advanced part continued to immigrate to the adjacent mountainous area of Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hubei and Henan provinces, and the developed to the ancestor of present East and Central Miao.\n\nThe A-Mao language is distributed in Zhaotong, Kunming, Qujing and Chuxiong Yi autonomous prefecture in the Northeast of Yunnan Province. And also Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao autonomous county, Hezhang county, Liupanshui, and Ziyun Miao and Buyi autonomous county in the West of Guizhou Province. There are 300,000 native speakers. Representative dialect: Shimenkan (石门坎), Weining County (威宁县).\n\n\nThe morphology of the three branches of the Hmong language is basically the same. The following examples are from Central Miao. A-Hmao is similar to Hmong, which is an isolating language in which most morphemes are monosyllables. As a result, verbs are not overtly inflected. Tense, aspect, mood, person, number, gender, and case are indicated lexically.\n\nSingle-morpheme word\n\n1) Monosyllable single-morpheme word. (single-morpheme words are mostly monosyllable in Hmong language)\n\nExample:\n\n\"naxi\" human being \"xed\" tiger\n\n\"et\" tree \"wil\" I\n\n\"mongx\" you \"nenx\" he\n\n\"hsangb\" thousand \"wangs\" ten thousand\n\n\"bat\" hundred \"lol\" come\n\n\"mongl\" go; leave\n\n2) Multisyllable single-morpheme word. (there is a small number of Multisyllable single-morpheme word in Hmong language. Mostly, they are disyllable, and there is very little of 3 or more syllables.)\n\na. Alliterative.

Adjective morpheme dominating noun morpheme. Example:\n\n\"dad hvib\" patience \"hvent ves\" pleasantly cool\n\n\"mais bil\" proficiency \"mais ves\" tired\n\n4) Affixes\n\nMostly are prefixes, and commonly used prefixes are ghab-, diub-, hangd-, gid-, jib-, daib-, bod-, xuk-, and so on. Ghab- is the most commonly used.\n\na. Ghab- means human or animal body and part, plant part and things related to plants, natural objects, things related to buildings, utensils and abstract objectives. Example:\n\n\"ghab jid\" body \"ghab naix\" ear\n\n\"ghab ghaib\" root \"ghab nex\" leaf\n\n\"ghab qangb\" living room \"ghab sot\" kicken\n\n\"ghab dliux\" soul \"ghabnangs\" destiny\n\nb. Diub- means location. Example:\n\n\"diub senx\" provincial capital \"dioub ghaib\" on the street\n\n\"diub zaid\" at home\n\nc. Hangd-/khangd- means aspect and direction. Example:\n\n\"hangd nongx hangd nangl\" aspect of eating and wearing\n\n\"hangd nongd\" here \"hangd momgx\" there\n\n\"hangd deis\" where\n\nd. Gid- means aspect and direction. Example:\n\n\"gid waix\" above \"gid dab\" below\n\n\"gid gux\" outside \"gid niangs\" inside\n\ne. Jib- means person. Example:\n\n\"jib daib\" child \"jib hlangb\" grandchild\n\n\"jib bad\" man\n\nf. Daib- means person and some kinship terminology. Example:\n\n\"daib pik\" girl \"daib jangs\" man, boy, husband\n\n\"daib nenl\" uncle\n\ng. Bod- means round object. Example:\n\n\"bod vib\" stone \"bod ghof jus\" knee\n\n\"bod liul\" fist\n\nh. Xuk- means uncertain quantity.\n\n\"xuk laix\" a handful of\n\nThe syntax of Hmong languages, regardless of the type of part of speech or phrase and the division of constituents of the sentence and the sentence types, are basically the same. The basic word order of Hmong is SVO. Within the noun phrase, possessors precede possessed nouns, and adjectives and relative clauses follow the nouns they modify. Noun phrases have the form as (possessive) + (quantifier) + (classifier) + noun + (adjective) + (demonstrative). As in Chinese, question formation does not involve word order change. For wh- questions, the wh- word does not occupy a sentence-initial position in Hmong as in many other languages. (e.g. the English sentence ‘What are you doing?’ would be rendered ‘you do what’ in Hmong)\n\nA-Hmao is an ethnic group without their own writing system. Until the beginning of the 20th century, missionary Samuel Pollard invented the Pollard script, which was based on the decorative symbols on their clothing. During the time without writing system, the way A-Hmao people recorded their history, besides passing down through their ancient songs, was that they weave the history of their past memories on their clothes. Those images became the historical memory of their national construction.\n\n"}

When little or no direct documentation of ancestor languages is available, determining whether a similarity is genetic or areal can be difficult. Edward Sapir notably used evidence of contact and diffusion as a negative tool for genetic reconstruction, treating it as a subject in its own right only at the end of his career (e.g., for the influence of Tibetan on Tocharian).\n\nGenetic relationships are represented in the family tree model of language change, and areal relationships are represented in the wave model. William Labov in 2007 reconciled these models in a general framework based on differences between children and adults in their language learning ability. Adults do not preserve structural features with sufficient regularity to establish a norm in their community, but children do. Linguistic features are diffused across an area by contacts among adults. Languages branch into dialects and thence into related languages through small changes in the course of children's learning processes which accumulate over generations, and when speech communities do not communicate (frequently) with each other, these cumulative changes diverge. Diffusion of areal features for the most part hinges on low-level phonetic shifts, whereas tree-model transmission includes in addition structural factors such as \"grammatical conditioning, word boundaries, and the systemic relations that drive chain shifting\".\n\nIn some areas with high linguistic diversity, a number of areal features have spread across a set of languages to form a sprachbund (also known as a linguistic area, convergence area or diffusion area). Some examples are the Balkan sprachbund, the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, and the languages of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "12773307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12773307", "title": "Axiom of categoricity", "text": "Axiom of categoricity\n\nThe axiom of categoricity is a term coined by J. K. Chambers in 1995 to refer to the once-widespread tenet of linguistic theory that in order to properly study language, linguistic data should be removed or abstracted from all real-world context so as to be free of any inconsistencies or variability. This principle was, for different theorists and schools of thought, taken as a prerequisite for linguistic theory, or as a self-evident falsehood to be rejected. It remains an influential idea in linguistics.\n\nFerdinand de Saussure divided language into two categories, \"langue\" (the abstract grammatical system a language uses) and \"parole\" (language as it is used in real-life circumstances). Historically, the range of language study had been limited to \"langue\", since the data could easily be found in the linguist's own intuitions about language and there was no need to look at the often inconsistent and chaotic language patterns found in everyday society.\n\nIn the 20th century, scholars began to further embrace the assumption that linguistic data should be removed from its social, real-life context. Martin Joos stated the axiom this way in 1950:\n\"We must make our 'linguistics' a kind of mathematics within which inconsistency is by definition impossible.\" (Joos 1950: 701-2)\nIn 1965, Noam Chomsky offered a more substantial definition, incorporating his concepts of linguistic competence and linguistic performance, terms that closely parallel Saussure's \"langue\" and \"parole\".\n\"Linguistic theory is concerned primarily with an ideal speaker-listener, in a completely homogeneous speech-community, who knows its language perfectly and is unaffected by such grammatically irrelevant conditions as memory limitations, distractions, shifts of attention and interest, and errors (random or characteristic) in applying his knowledge of the language in actual performance.\" (Chomsky 1965: 3)\nAround this time, several linguistic studies began to acknowledge not only the presence, but importance of variability found in speaker data. Instead of dismissing this variability on the grounds that the variants either belonged to different coexisting linguistic systems or demonstrated unpredictable free variation as had been done before, they recognized that it might be influenced by the speaker's circumstances. Sociologist John L. Fischer conducted one of the first systematic studies of language variation in 1958 to address variation in the speech of New England schoolchildren. Finding free variation to be an unsatisfactory explanation, he wrote:\n\"...Another sort of explanation is possible in terms of current factors which lead a given child in given circumstances to produce one of the variants rather than another.\" (Fischer 1958: 47-8)\nFischer eventually discovered a correlation between the linguistic variants and independent social variables such as class and sex. By gathering variable data and analyzing it, he proved that the inconsistencies were indeed manageable, resisting the Axiom of categoricity's premise that the data be abstracted from social contexts in order to make it coherent and manageable. By invalidating this premise, it proved that acceptance of the Axiom of categoricity is not a requirement but rather an idealistic option that may or may not be useful to a study. Fischer's work created the basis for sociolinguistic analysis in the coming years, notably William Labov's studies in Martha's Vineyard and New York City during the 1960s.\n\nDespite its rejection by sociolinguists, the Axiom of categoricity is still an influential postulate in some schools of linguistics. Chambers claims that all the linguistic progress that was made when the axiom was the law remains successful and indisputable. (Chambers 1995: 12-29)\n\n\n"}

The first portion in Avar, John, was published in 1979, Mark followed in 1996, Luke and Acts in 2000, Proverbs in 2005, the complete New Testament in September 2008, and Genesis in 2011. Work on the Old Testament continues.\n\nN. Bobnikrov supervised a translation of the four gospels into Bashkir. This was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1902. The Institute for Bible Translation is currently working on a new translation. The New Testament is almost ready to be published.\n\nA new translation into the Chuvash language was initiated by the Russian Bible Society in the 1990s, coordinating New Testament translation carried out by the Baptist churches and the Old Testament translation carried out by the Russian Orthodox Church. The completed Bible translation was published in 2009.\n\nA portion of the Bible was first published in Crimean Tatar by the British and Foreign Bible Society prior to 1912. The Institute for Bible translation has been translating the Bible into Modern Crimean Tatar. Jonah was published in 1978, Matthew in 1985, Luke, John, Acts and James in 1996, Matthew again in 2006, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes in 2007, the four gospels and Acts in 2008, Genesis, Exodus and Deuteronomy in 2009 and Psalms in 2011.\n\nThe Institute for Bible Translation is translating the Bible into the Gagauz language.\n\nThe first portion of the Bible in Koryak language (Chukotko-Kamchatkan family), selections from Luke, was published by Institute for Bible Translation in 1995. This was followed by the whole gospel in 2005, and the first 17 verses of John in 2008.\n\nThe first full Bible in the Komi language was issued in 1823 in Saint-Petersburg by the Russian Bible Society. There were also the 1885 edition of the Bible and a translation of the New Testament made in 1970-80s. Though these three editions gave rise to complaints and in 2008 the Institute for Bible Translation issued a modern translation of the Bible.\n\nNikolay Ilminsky, a Russian Orthodox priest and missionary, was the first who greatly promoted translations of the Bible into the minority languages of the Russian Empire including the Tatar dialect of the Christianized Tatars, called the Kryashens. He and his colleagues translated and issued the Gospels (1891), the Psalter (1892), and the Epistles (1907), though the full translation was not completed. Unlike the dialect of the Muslim Tatars, who used the Arabic scripts then, the Kryashen dialect (language) has used and still uses its own version of the Cyrillic alphabet, which slightly differs from the modern Standard (Kazan) Tatar alphabet, and also has minor peculiarities in vocabulary and grammar. In 2005 the Russian Bible Society published a modern translation of the New Testament in Kryashen.\n\nHassan Beg Effendi Mutsaloff's gospel of Matthew in Kumyk was published in 1888, followed by Mark in 1897.\n\nThe Institute of Bible Translations New Testament was published in 2007.

The complete Bible was published in 2011.\n\nThe translation of the Bible into Wakhi language has begun in Moscow. The first publication of a biblical text into Wakhi, was an excerpt from the Gospel of Luke (2:1-20) in a book on the birth of Jesus in the 80 languages of the peoples of the CIS, (IBT, 2000. p. 68-69). In 2001 the Institute for Bible Translation published 1,500 copies of \"Selections from Luke\".\n\nAn edition of the Gospels into the Sakha language (Yakut language) was prepared by the Kazan Missionary Society at the expense of the British and Foreign Bible Society, two were finished in 1897. The four gospels were completed in June 1898, and an edition of 3,000 was printed at Kazan.\n\nCurrently a new full translation of the Bible sponsored by the International Bible Society is being done by the well-known writer Nikolai Luginov, with assistance from a professional translator, Aita Shaposnikova.

As of 2012, the Catalan Federation for the Deaf estimates 25,000 LSC signers and roughly 12,000 deaf people around the Catalan region. It has about 50% intelligibility with Spanish Sign Language (LSE). On the basis of mutual intelligibility, lexicon, and social attitudes, linguists have argued that LSC and LSE are distinct languages.\n\nSince 1994, LSC has had official status, due to a law to promote the language promulgated by Generalitat de Catalunya. Catalonia was the first Spanish Autonomous Community to approve a law for a sign language.\n\nFESOCA (\"Catalan Federation of Deaf People\") is an NGO founded in 1979 to represent and to defend the rights of deaf associations and individuals to achieve a full social participation and integration. FESOCA organises several courses, activities and meetings. In 2007, a bill was passed in Spain referred to as the \"Bill of Deaf People\" which was designed to cover sign language issues.\n\nThere are research groups for LSC, such as ILLESCAT (LSC Study Centre). This centre studies the evolution of the language, makes linguistic studies and creates new neologisms. The \"Platform for Linguistic and Cultural Rights for LSC Users\" a.k.a. \"LSC, Ara!\" carried out a law to promote this language in the Statute of Autonomy.\n\nWittmann (1991) suspects that LSC may be part of the French Sign Language family, but transmission to Catalonia would have happened early, and is not easy to demonstrate. Likewise, a Linguistic Professor from the University of Coruna who specializes in LSC, found that the difference between a language like this and other more common forms of sign language is the use of \"neutral space\" in front of the signer when speaking on real life situations as well as the use of visual character.\n\nLSC primarily uses two of the three planes: horizontal and vertical planes.\n\nA 2008 study using LSC demonstrated a universal pattern in the manner in the way signed and spoken language are used to communicate ideas. The experiment took into consideration movement, handshape and location as the three modes of comparison and analysis.\n\nIn another study, the numeral signs of LSC were analyzed, noting the differing methods of signing numbers above five, which found some differences between LSC and American Sign Language (ASL) and emphasized how these changes can cause a language to change and evolve. Catalan Sign Language is more transparent (makes decimal values more explicit) than Spanish and Catalan.\n\nImpersonal sentences in LSC are determinant upon syntactic differences in pronominal forms, role shift, and spatial locations.\n\nAs in ASL, verbs are divided into simple, deictic, and spatial-locative verbs.\n\nThe complexity of signing metaphors in LSC was studied in an experiment involving double-mapping, and the iconicity in sign languages like LSC and ASL plays a fundamental role for cognitive theories noting the symbiotic relationship between grammar and bodily cognition. Deaf people in Catalonia are taught to read and write oral languages.\n\nIn May 2015 the Departament de Cultura (Department for Culture) created the LSC Award in order to acknowledge individuals, institutions and initiatives for their contribution to the promotion and spreading of LSC.\n\nThis biennial award has the same consideration as other awards regarding spoken languages like the Pompeu Fabra Award for Catalan and the Robèrt Lafont Award for Occitan.\n\n\n"}

This runaway process, once started, could be as irreversible as the firing of a gun.\n\nIn its original form, the hypothesis proposed that the \"clathrate gun\" could cause abrupt runaway warming on a time scale less than a human lifetime. A 2018 published review concluded that the clathrate gun hypothesis remains controversial, but that better understanding is vital.\n\nStudies published in 2000 attributed the hypothesis to be responsible for warming events in and at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, but this is now thought to be unlikely.\nAt one point there seemed to be stronger evidence that runaway methane clathrate breakdown may have caused drastic alteration of the ocean environment (such as ocean acidification and ocean stratification) and of the atmosphere over timescales of tens of thousands of years during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum 56 million years ago, and most notably the Permian–Triassic extinction event, when up to 96% of all marine species became extinct, 252 million years ago. However, the pattern of isotope shifts expected to result from a massive release of methane does not match the patterns seen there. First, the isotope shift is too large for this hypothesis, as it would require five times as much methane as is postulated for the PETM, and then, it would have to be reburied at an unrealistically high rate to account for the rapid increases in the C/C ratio throughout the early Triassic before it was released again several times. Yet, it is still argued that a potential positive feedback mechanism from clathrate dissociation would amplify future global warming. However, past hydrate dissociation at Svalbard eight thousand years ago has been attributed to isostatic rebound (continental uplift following deglaciation).\n\nThe SWIPA 2017 report notes, \"Arctic sources and sinks of greenhouse gases are still hampered by data and knowledge gaps.\"\n\nTwo events possibly linked to methane excursions are the Permian–Triassic extinction event and the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Equatorial permafrost methane clathrate may have had a role in the sudden warm-up of \"Snowball Earth\", 630 million years ago. However, warming at the end of the last ice age is not thought to be due to methane release. A similar event is the methane hydrate releases, following ice-sheet retreat during the last glacial period, around 12,000 years ago, in response to the Bølling-Allerød warming.\n\nMethane clathrate, also known commonly as methane hydrate, is a form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its crystal structure. Potentially large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of the Earth, although the estimates of total resource size given by various experts differ by many orders of magnitude, leaving doubt as to the size of methane clathrate deposits (particularly in the viability of extracting them as a fuel resource). Indeed, cores of greater than 10 centimeters' contiguous depth had only been found in three sites as of 2000, and some resource reserve size estimates for specific deposits/locations have been based primarily on seismology.\n\nThe sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits in runaway climate change could be a cause of past, future, and present climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; some have suggested that this was a main factor in the planet warming 6 °C, which happened during the end-Permian extinction, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Despite its atmospheric lifetime of around 12 years, it has a global warming potential of 72 over 20 years, 25 over 100 years, and 33 when accounted for aerosol interactions. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen and hydroxyl radical content of the atmosphere.\n\nSubsea permafrost occurs beneath the seabed and exists in the continental shelves of the polar regions. This source of methane is different from methane clathrates, but contributes to the overall outcome and feedbacks.\n\nFrom sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from subsea permafrost into the ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100–630 mg methane per square meter is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, when wind accelerates air-sea gas exchange, methane levels in the water column drop dramatically. Observations suggest that methane release from seabed permafrost will progress slowly, rather than abruptly. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by global warming, and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more rapid methane release from this source.\n\nAnother kind of exception is in clathrates associated with the Arctic ocean, where clathrates can exist in shallower water stabilized by lower temperatures rather than higher pressures; these may potentially be marginally stable much closer to the surface of the sea-bed, stabilized by a frozen 'lid' of permafrost preventing methane escape.\n\nThe so-called self-preservation phenomenon has been studied by Russian geologists starting in the late 1980s. This metastable clathrate state can be a basis for release events of methane excursions, such as during the interval of the Last Glacial Maximum. A study from 2010 concluded with the possibility for a trigger of abrupt climate warming based on metastable methane clathrates in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) region.\n\nEuxinic (i.e. sulfidic) and anoxic events happened in the past on different time scales ranging from decades to centuries (from impact events) or through climate change within tens of thousands of years or a few million years. According to Gregory Ryskin, such a scenario could lead to the release of methane and other gases (e.g., , ) into the atmosphere, from the ocean. Following atmospheric methane excursions he postulates explosions and burning of methane would produce lots of smoke and dust, which would first lead to global cooling. And likely after a relatively short geological period following stratospheric cooling, global warming would take over.\n\nMost deposits of methane clathrate are in sediments too deep to respond rapidly, and modelling by Archer (2007) suggests the methane forcing should remain a minor component of the overall greenhouse effect. Clathrate deposits destabilize from the deepest part of their stability zone, which is typically hundreds of metres below the seabed. A sustained increase in sea temperature will warm its way through the sediment eventually, and cause the shallowest, most marginal clathrate to start to break down; but it will typically take on the order of a thousand years or more for the temperature signal to get through.\nHowever, there is also a possibility for the formation of gas migration pathways within fault zones in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, through the process of talik formation, or pingo-like features.\nAccording to data released by the EPA, atmospheric methane (CH) concentrations in parts per billion (ppb) remained between 400–800ppb in the years 600,000 BC to 1900 AD, and since 1900 AD have risen to levels between 1600–1800ppb. Global averaged monthly mean atmospheric methane is currently at ~1860 ppb CH4, increases between 8.8 ± 2.6 through 2017 compare to an average annual increase of 5.7 ± 1.1 ppb between 2007 and 2013.\n\nA USGS metastudy in 2017 by the USGS Gas Hydrates Project concluded\n\nResearch carried out in 2008 in the Siberian Arctic showed millions of tons of methane being released, apparently through perforations in the seabed permafrost, with concentrations in some regions reaching up to 100 times normal levels. The excess methane has been detected in localized hotspots in the outfall of the Lena River and the border between the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea. At the time, some of the melting was thought to be the result of geological heating, but more thawing was believed to be due to the greatly increased volumes of meltwater being discharged from the Siberian rivers flowing north. The current methane release had previously been estimated at 0.5 megatonnes per year. Shakhova et al. (2008) estimate that not less than 1,400 gigatonnes of carbon is presently locked up as methane and methane hydrates under the Arctic submarine permafrost, and 5–10% of that area is subject to puncturing by open taliks. They conclude that \"release of up to 50 gigatonnes of predicted amount of hydrate storage [is] highly possible for abrupt release at any time\". That would increase the methane content of the planet's atmosphere by a factor of twelve, equivalent in greenhouse effect to a doubling in the current level of .\n\nThis is what led to the original Clathrate gun hypothesis, and in 2008 the United States Department of Energy National Laboratory system and the United States Geological Survey's Climate Change Science Program both identified potential clathrate destabilization in the Arctic as one of four most serious scenarios for abrupt climate change, which have been singled out for priority research. The USCCSP released a report in late December 2008 estimating the gravity of this risk. A 2012 assessment of the literature identifies methane hydrates on the Shelf of East Arctic Seas as a potential trigger.\n\nHong et al. 2017 studied methane seepage in the shallow arctic seas at the Barents Sea close to Svalbard. Temperature at the seabed has fluctuated seasonally over the last century, between -1.8 and 4.8 °C, it has only affected release of methane to a depth of about 1.6 meters at the sediment-water interface. Hydrates can be stable through the top 60 meters of the sediments and the current observed releases originate from deeper below the sea floor. They conclude that the increased methane flux started hundreds to thousands of years ago, noted about it, \"..episodic ventilation of deep reservoirs rather than warming-induced gas hydrate dissociation.\" Summarizing his research, Hong stated:\n\nA trapped gas deposit on the continental slope off Canada in the Beaufort Sea, located in an area of small conical hills on the ocean floor is just 290 meters below sea level and considered the shallowest known deposit of methane hydrate. However, the ESAS region averages 45 meters in depth, and it is assumed that below the seafloor, sealed by sub-sea permafrost layers, hydrates deposits are located.\n\nSeismic observation in 2012 of destabilizing methane hydrate along the continental slope of the eastern United States, following the intrusion of warmer ocean currents, suggests that underwater landslides could release methane. The estimated amount of methane hydrate in this slope is 2.5 gigatonnes (about 0.2% of the amount required to cause the PETM), and it is unclear if the methane could reach the atmosphere. However, the authors of the study caution: \"It is unlikely that the western North Atlantic margin is the only area experiencing changing ocean currents; our estimate of 2.5 gigatonnes of destabilizing methane hydrate may therefore represent only a fraction of the methane hydrate currently destabilizing globally.\" \n\nBill McGuire notes, \"There may be a threat of submarine landslides around the margins of Greenland, which are less well explored. Greenland is already uplifting, reducing the pressure on the crust beneath and also on submarine methane hydrates in the sediment around its margins, and increased seismic activity may be apparent within decades as active faults beneath the ice sheet are unloaded. This could provide the potential for the earthquake or methane hydrate destabilisation of submarine sediment, leading to the formation of submarine slides and, perhaps, tsunamis in the North Atlantic.\"\n\nResearch by Klaus Wallmann et al. 2018 concluded that hydrate dissociation at Svalbard 8,000 years ago was due to the rebound of the seabed following ice-sheet retreat. As a result the water depth got shallower with less hydrostatic pressure, without further warming. The study, also found that today's deposits at the site become unstable at a depth of ~ 400 meters, due to seasonal bottom water warming, and it remains unclear if this is due to natural variability or anthropogenic warming.\n\nA study of the effects for the original hypothesis, based on a coupled climate–carbon cycle model (GCM) assessed a 1000-fold (from <1 to 1000 ppmv) methane increase—within a single pulse, from methane hydrates (based on carbon amount estimates for the PETM, with ~2000 GtC), and concluded it would increase atmospheric temperatures by more than 6 °C within 80 years. Further, carbon stored in the land biosphere would decrease by less than 25%, suggesting a critical situation for ecosystems and farming, especially in the tropics.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2850828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2850828", "title": "Comanche language", "text": "Comanche language\n\nComanche is a Uto-Aztecan language spoken by the Comanche people, who split off from the Shoshone soon after they acquired horses around 1705. The Comanche language and the Shoshoni language are therefore quite similar, although certain consonant changes in Comanche have inhibited mutual intelligibility.\n\nThe name \"Comanche\" comes from the Ute word ' meaning \"enemy, stranger\". Their own name for the language is ' which means \"language of the people\".\n\nAlthough efforts are now being made to ensure its survival, most speakers of the language are elderly. In the late 19th century, Comanche children were placed in boarding schools where they were discouraged from speaking their native language, and even severely punished for doing so. The second generation then grew up speaking English, because of the belief that it was better for them not to know Comanche.\n\nThe Comanche language was briefly prominent during World War II. A group of seventeen young men referred to as the Comanche Code Talkers were trained and used by the U.S. Army to send messages conveying sensitive information in the Comanche language so that it could not be deciphered by the enemy.\n\nAs of July 2013, there are roughly 25-30 native speakers of the language, according to \"The Boston Globe\". An online class is available from the Learn Comanche organization, and the Comanche Language and Cultural Preservation Committee offers dictionaries and language learning materials. Comanche language courses are also available at the Comanche Nation College. The college is conducting a language recording project, as the language is \"mostly oral,\" and emphasizing instruction for tribal members.\n\nComanche has a typical Numic vowel inventory of six vowels. In addition, there is the common diphthong . Historically, there was a certain amount of free variation between and (as shown by comparison with Shoshoni cognates), but the variation is no longer so common and most morphemes have become fixed on either or . In the following chart, the basic symbols given are in the IPA, whereas the equivalent symbols in the conventional orthography are given to the right of them, in parentheses and boldface. Note that Comanche also has voiceless vowels, but they are non-phonemic and therefore not represented in this chart. In the conventional orthography, these vowels are marked with an underline: a̱, e̱, i̱, o̱, u̱, ʉ̱.\n\nComanche distinguishes vowels by length. Vowels can be either long or short. Long vowels are never devoiced and in the orthography they are represented as (aa, ee, ii, oo, uu, ɨɨ). An example of a long vowel is the (ee) in [wakaréʔee] meaning 'turtle'. Short vowels can be lengthened when they are stressed. Short vowels can be either voiced or voiceless. Unstressed short vowels are usually devoiced when /s/ or /h/ follows and optionally when word-final.\n\nComanche has a typical Numic consonant inventory. As with the vowel charts, the basic symbols given in this chart are in the IPA, whereas the equivalent symbols in the conventional orthography are given to the right of them in parentheses and boldface.\n\nComanche stress most commonly falls on the first syllable. Exceptions to this rule, such as in the words \"Waʔsáasiʔ\", meaning 'Osage people', and \"aná\", meaning 'ouch!', are marked with an acute accent.\n\nFor the purpose of stress placement, the diphthongs /ai/, /oi/, and /ui/ act as one vowel with one mora. Additionally, possessive pronouns, which serve as proclitics, do not affect the stress of a word (so that \"nʉ + námi\" 'my sister' retains its stress on the /a/ in \"námi\").\n\nSecondary stress is placed on the second syllable of a two-syllable word, the third syllable of a word with three, four, or five syllables, and the fourth syllable of a word with six syllables.\n\n\nPrimary stress is \"marked when it is non-initial stress\". In addition, \"when a pronoun is suffixed by, for instance a postposition, the pronoun does take primary - and initial - stress.\" An example is [nɨvía] nɨ-pia, which means my mother (my-mother). In the following data where primary stress appears it will be shown as an \"acute accent.\" Primary stress is found in words or compounds of three, six and five syllables. However, when primary stress is marked in a third syllable it can also be consider as a secondary stress according to Canonge's but an \"exception to this case is when both a proclitic and prefix are used.\" An example of a third syllable stress is [há.bi+hu.píi.tu] which means 'stopped and lay down'. Words with \"five syllables have primary stress on the first syllable.\" An example is [ká.wo+nò.ka.tu] which means 'stress'. Also, words with six syllables have primary stress on the first syllable. An example is [kú.ʔi.na.kù.ʔe.tu] which means 'rosts for'.\n\n\nNon-initial stress can be found in any syllable of a word that is not in the initial position and it can also fall on long vowel. Also, the \"initial syllable never weakens to the point of voicelessness\"\n\nAlternating stress occurs when there are words with three four, five and six syllables. In addition alternating stress is given \"when nouns of compound are coequal, a root or stem has one-syllable suffix.\" Also, prefixes or not stem-changes do not receive an indicial stress because the alternating stress \"begins on the second syllable as in the following word of six syllables, following the pattern of five-syllable words.\" An example is [wu.hká.ʔa.mí.ʔanu] which means 'went to cut down'. An examples of alternating stress in a four, five and six syllabuses are [á.ni.múi ]'housefly', [yú.pu.sí.a] meaning 'louse' and [wuh+tú.pu káʔ 'buckle] which meaning 'button'. A examples of three syllables is [wáhkát ìmat òʔiàt I] waha=-?? twelve, which means 'two-??'.\n\n\nStress shift occurs when \"verves often exhibit stylistic stress shift when occurring at the end of a breathing group.\" In addition, stress moves \"one syllable to the right if that syllable is voiced; otherwise it skips over the voiceless vowels to the next syllable\". An example is [pohínu ]'jumped. According to Charney stress shift is caused by a suffixes-n which cause a 'right ward shift of stress in form with the shape CVHCV or CVhV.\" Examples of CVHCV is [marohtíkwan] ma-toH-tíkwa-n which means 'he hit him' and an example of CVhv is [pahín] pahi-n which means 'he fell'.\nBy using the form CVHCV or CVhV we can see that -h \"is presented as a second or a precipitated consonant\". However, \"stress does not shift rightwards when the verb root does not contain [h]. An example is [nómiʔan] no-miʔa-n meaning 'they moved camp.'\n\n\nLike many languages of the Americas, Comanche can be classified as a polysynthetic language.\n\nComanche nouns are inflected for case and number, and the language possesses a dual number. Like many Uto-Aztecan languages, nouns may take an absolutive suffix. Many cases are also marked using postpositions.\n\nPersonal pronouns exist for three numbers (singular, dual, and plural) and three persons. They have different forms depending on whether or not they are the subject or object of a verb, possessive (including reflexive possessive forms), or the object of a postposition. Like many languages of the Americas, Comanche first-person plural pronouns have both inclusive and exclusive forms.\n\nThe Comanche paradigm for nominal number suffixes is illustrated below:\n\n\nMany of the verb stems regularly are suppletive: intransitive verbs are suppletive for singular versus plural subject and transitive verbs are suppletive for singular versus plural object. Verbs can take various affixes, including incorporated nouns before the stem. Most verb affixes are suffixes, except for voicing-changing prefixes and instrumental prefixes.\nThe verb stem can take a number of prefixes and suffixes. A sketch of all the elements that may be affixed to the verb is given on the right:\n\nIn addition to verbal affixes, Comanche verbs can also be augmented by other verbs. Although in principle Comanche verbs may be freely combined with other verbs, in actuality only a handful of verbs, termed auxiliary verbs, are frequently combined with others. These forms take the full range of aspectual suffixes. Common auxiliary verbs in Comanche include \"hani\" 'to do, make', \"naha\" 'to be, become', \"miʔa\" 'to go', and \"katʉ / yʉkwi\" 'to sit'. An example of how the verbs combine: \"katʉ\" 'to sit' + \"miʔa\" 'to go' = \"katʉmiʔa\" \"to ride (and go)\".\n\nAs mentioned above, Comanche has a rich repertoire of instrumental prefixes, and certain verbs (termed instrumental verbs) cannot occur without an instrumental prefix. These prefixes can affect the transitivity of a verb. The Comanche instrumental prefixes are listed below:\n\nComanche parts of speech include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, and interjections (such as \"haa\" 'yes' and \"kee\" 'no'), as well as particles.\n\nThe word order is SOV: Subject - Object - Verb. But while the standard word order in Comanche is SOV, it can shift in two specific circumstances. The topic of a sentence, though marked with one of two particles, is often placed at the beginning of the sentence, defying the standard word order. Furthermore, the subject of a sentence is often placed second in a sentence. When the subject is also the topic, as is often the case, it ends up in the first position, preserving SOV word order; otherwise, the subject will be placed second. For example, the English sentence 'I hit the man' could be rendered in Comanche with the components in either of the following two orders: 'I' (topic) 'man' (object) 'hit' (an aspect marker) - the standard SOV word order - or 'man' (object and topic) 'I' 'hit' (an aspect marker) - an OSV word order, which accentuates the role of the man who was hit.\n\nLike other Numic languages, Comanche has switch-reference markers to handle subordination. This refers to markers which indicate whether or not a subordinate verb has the same or different subject as the main verb, and in the case of Comanche, also the temporal relation between the two verbs.\n\nWhen the verb of a subordinate clause has a different subject from the verb of the main clause, and the time of the verbs is simultaneous, the subordinate verb is marked with \"-ku\", and its subject is marked as if it were an object. When the time of the verbs is not simultaneous, the subordinate verb is marked with one of several affixes depending on the duration of the subordinate verb and whether it refers to an action which occurred before that described by the main verb or one which occurred after.\n\nThe Comanche Alphabet was developed by Dr. Alice Anderton, a linguistic anthropologist, and was adopted as the official Comanche Alphabet by the Comanche Nation in 1994. The alphabet is as follows:\n\n\nIn the 1956 film \"The Searchers\", starring John Wayne, there are several badly pronounced Comanche words interspersed, such as \"nawyecka\" (\"nooyʉka\" 'move camp around') and \"timoway\" (\"tʉmʉʉ\" 'buy, trade').\n\nIn the 1963 film \"McLintock!\", also starring John Wayne, McLintock (Wayne) and Chief Puma (Michael Pate) speak Comanche several times throughout the film.\n\nIn a 2013 \"Boston Globe\" article, linguist Todd McDaniels of Comanche Nation College commented on Johnny Depp's attempts to speak the Comanche language in the film \"The Lone Ranger\", saying \"The words were there, the pronunciation was shaky but adequate.\"\n\nIn the 2016 film \"The Magnificent Seven\" two of the titular characters, a Comanche warrior named Red Harvest and Sam Chisholm, an African-American warrant officer, speak Comanche to each other.\n\n\n\n"}

He studied at the famous monastery of Qinnasrin (on the left bank of the Euphrates, and later at Alexandria.\n\nOn his return from Alexandria he became a monk at Edessa, where he was known for his learning. Ordained a priest in 672, he was appointed metropolitan of Edessa by his friend Athanasius II, Patriarch of Antioch. He held this office for three or four years, but the clergy opposed his strict enforcement of the Church canons. He was not supported by Julian II, the successor of Athanasius. In response to Julian's suggestion that he temporize his criticisms, he publicly burned a copy of the neglected canons in front of Julian's residence and retired to the monastery of Kaisum near Samosata. From there to the monastery of Eusebona where, for eleven years, he taught the Psalms and the reading of the Scriptures in Greek. Towards the close of this period Jacob again encountered opposition, this time from monks who despised the Greeks.\n\nJacob left Eusebona and proceeded to the great convent of Tel Ade (Arabic: تل عدا), one of several Syriac Orthodox monasteries on the 'mountain of Edessa' (? modern Tellgdi, northwest of Aleppo), where he spent nine years in revising and amending the Peshitta version of the Old Testament with the aid of the various Greek versions. Jacob played a prominent part in the synod Julian convened in 706.\n\nHe was finally recalled to the bishopric of Edessa in 708, but died four months later.\n\nJacob belonged to the Syriac Orthodox Church and his writings have a definite Miaphysite character. In the literature of his country he holds much the same place as St. Jerome does among the Latins. Assemani tried hard to prove him orthodox (\"B.O.\" i. 470 sqq.) but changed his opinion on reading his biography by Barhebraeus (ib. ii. 3–7). See especially Lamy, \"Dissert. de Syrorum fide\", pp. 206 sqq. i Text at Leipzig 1889 (\"Das Buch der Erkenntniss der Wahrheit oder der Ursache aller Ursachen\"): translation (posthumously) at Strassburg 1893.\n\nMost of his works are in prose. Few have been published. In 1911 most of the information available was to be found in Giuseppe Simone Assemani's \"Bibliotheca Orientalis\" and Wright's \"Catalogue of Syriac MSS in the British Museum\".\n\nJacob produced a revision of the bible, based on the Peshitta. Wright calls this a curious eclectic or patchwork text. Five volumes survive in Europe (Wright, \"Catalogue\" 38). This was the last attempt at a revision of the Old Testament in the Syriac Orthodox Church. Jacob was also the chief founder of the Syriac Massorah among the Syrians, which produced such manuscripts as the one (Vat. cliii.) described by Wiseman in \"Horae syriacae\", part iii.\n\nHe also wrote commentaries and scholia on the bible. Specimens of these are given by Assemani and Wright. They are quoted a lot by later commentators, who often refer to Jacob as the \"Interpreter of the Scriptures\".\n\nHe also wrote a \"Hexahemeron\", or treatise on the six days of creation. Manuscripts of this exist at Leiden and at Lyon. It was his last work, and being left incomplete was finished by his friend George the bishop of the Arabs.\n\nHe translated the apocryphal \"History of the Rechabites\" composed by Zosimus from Greek into Syriac (Wright, \"Catalogue\" 1128, and Nau in \"Revue semitique\" vi. 263, vii. 54, 136).\n\nJacob made a collection of ecclesiastical canons. In his letter to the priest Addai we possess a collection of canons from his pen, given in the form of answers to Addai's questions. These were edited by Lagarde in \"Reliquiae juris eccl. syriace\", pp. 117 sqq. and Thomas Joseph Lamy in \"Dissert\". pp. 98 sqq.\n\nAdditional canons were given in Wright's \"Notulae syriacae\".\n\nAll of them have been translated and expounded by Carl Kayser, \"Die Canones Jacobs von Edessa\" (Leipzig, 1886).\n\nHe also made many contributions to Syriac liturgy, both original and as translations from Greek. As a liturgical author, Jacob drew up an anaphora, or liturgy, revised the Liturgy of St. James, wrote the celebrated \"Book of Treasures\", composed orders of baptism, of the blessing of water on the eve of the Epiphany, and of the celebration of matrimony, to which may be added his translation of Severus's order of Baptism.\n\nJacob's chief original contribution was his \"Enchiridion\" or \"Manual\", a tract on philosophical terms (Wright, \"Catalogue\" 984).\n\nTranslations of works of Aristotle have been attributed to him. However these are probably by other hands (Wright, \"Short History\" p. 149; Duval, \"Littérature syriaque\", pp. 255, 258).\n\nThe treatise \"De cause omnium causarum\", which was the work of a bishop of Edessa, was formerly attributed to Jacob; but the publication of the whole by Kayser has made it clear that the treatise is of much later date.\n\nJacob also wrote a \"Chronicle\", as a continuation of the \"Chronicon\" of Eusebius. This is described and quoted from by Michael the Syrian in book 7 of his own \"Chronicle\".\n\nThe original text of Jacob's continuation has unfortunately perished apart from 23 leaves in a manuscript in the British Library. Of these a full account is given in Wright, \"Catalogue\" 1062, and an edition of these has been published in CSCO by E.W.Brooks.\n\nJacob is most famous because of his contributions to the Syriac language and the West Syriac script (Serto).\n\nIn early Syriac vowels are either not shown, or else shown by a system of dots, used erratically. Jacob borrowed five vowel signs from Greek, which he wrote above the line as miniature symbols. This caught on, and is a feature of West Syriac writing even today. He also elaborated the system whereby some consonants could stand for vowels.\n\nJacob also tried to introduce the Greek practice of writing the vowels on the line, the same way as is done for the consonants. This was resisted by his countrymen and did not come into effect.\n\nIn his letter to George, bishop of Serugh, on Syriac orthography (published by Phillips in London 1869, and by Martin in Paris the same year) he sets forth the importance of fidelity by scribes in the copying of minutiae of spelling.\n\nAs a translator Jacob's greatest achievement was his Syriac version of the \"Homiliae cathedrales\" of Severus, the monophysite patriarch of Antioch. This important collection is now in part known to us by E. W. Brooks's edition and translation of the 6th book of selected epistles of Severus, according to another Syriac version made by Athanasius of Nisibis in 669. (Pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre says 677; but Athanasius was patriarch only 684–687.)\n\nA large number of letters by Jacob to various correspondents have been found in various MSS. Besides those on the canon law to Addai, and on grammar to George of Serugh referred to above, there are others dealing with doctrine, liturgy, and so forth. A few are in verse.\n\n"}

These names reflect the endonym ǃOra or !Gora . Sometimes !Ora is also known as Cape Khoe or Cape Hottentot, though the latter is derogatory. The various names are often treated as different languages (called South Khoekhoe when taken together), but they do not correspond to any actual dialect distinctions, and speakers may use \"Korana\" and \"Griqua\" interchangeably. Both names are also used more broadly, for example for the mixed-race Griqua people. There exist (or existed) several dialects of Khoemana, but the details are unknown.\n\nKhoemana is closely related to Khoekhoe, and the sound systems are broadly similar. The strongly aspirated Khoekhoe affricates are simply aspirated plosives in Khoemana. However, Khoemana has an ejective velar affricate, , which is not found in Khoekhoe, and a corresponding series of clicks, . Beach (1938) reported that the Khoekhoe of the time had a velar lateral ejective affricate, , a common realisation or allophone of in languages with clicks, and it might be expected that this is true for Khoemana as well. In addition, about half of all lexical words in Khoemana began with a click, compared to a quarter in Khoekhoe.\n\nIn Korana, [oe] and [oa] can be pronounced as [we] and [wa].\nThere are four tones in Khoemana:\nReports as to the number of Khoemana speakers are contradictory, but it is clear that it is nearly extinct. It was thought to be extinct until the discovery of four elderly speakers around Bloemfontein and Kimberley. A 2009 report by Don Killian of the University of Helsinki estimated that there were less than 30 speakers at the time. Matthias Brenzinger reported in 2012 that one possible speaker remained, but that she refused to speak the language. The discrepancies could be because the language has multiple dialects and goes by several names, with scholars not always referring to the same population. Khoemana is listed as \"critically endangered\" in UNESCO's \"Language Atlas\". The loss of this endangered language would have a significant impact on the heritage and culture of Khoemana speakers.\n\nRobust Khoemana (before more recent language attrition) is principally recorded in an 1879 notebook by Lucy Lloyd, which contains five short stories; some additional work was done in Ponelis (1975). As of 2009, the EuroBABEL project is searching for remaining speakers.\n\nThe people and their language first began to attract scholarly attention in the 1660s, coinciding with Dutch colonial efforts in the Cape of Good Hope and the resulting armed conflicts. At the time, Khoemana was widely spoken throughout the coastal regions of South Africa. After years of attrition during the colonial era to the 1930s, and under apartheid from 1948 to 1994, the language has all but vanished. Currently, speakers of Khoemana are not only scarce but scattered, due to forced migrations during the apartheid era. This has rendered the language particularly vulnerable.\n\n\n"}

In his native Spanish, as well as in English and some other languages, he is often referred to by the shorter form of his name, Leonardo Padura. He has written screenplays, two books of short stories and a series of detective novels translated into 10 languages. In 2012, Padura was awarded the National Prize for Literature, Cuba's national literary award and the most important award of its kind. In 2015, he was awarded with the Premio Principe de Asturias de las Letras of Spain, one of the most important literary prizes in the Spanish speaking world and usually considered as the Iberoamerican Nobel Prize.\n\nPadura, who was born in Havana, took a degree in Latin American literature at the University of Havana. In 1980 he first came to prominence as an investigative journalist in a literary magazine called \"Caimán Barbudo\", a well-established publication that is still in print today. He subsequently became known as an essayist and a writer of screenplays and in particular, detective novels. \nHe wrote his first short novel between 1983 and 1984. Titled \"Fiebre de caballos\" (Horse Fever), it was basically a love story. He then spent the next six years continuing to work as a journalist, reporting on a wide range of cultural and historical topics. However, around this time he began to write his first novel featuring police officer Mario Conde, and while he was writing it, Padura realised how fundamental his years as a journalist were to his development as a writer. Firstly it gave him a whole new experience of the country, and secondly, it consequently changed his style with respect to his first book.\n\nIn 2013, France named him a \"Chevalier\" of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\n\nPadura still lives and writes in his native city of Havana. \n\"In one of his essays entitled 'I would like to be Paul Auster,' Padura complains that he would love not to be constantly asked about politics in his country and why he continues living there. But this is very much his niche: he is widely seen as the best writer in Cuba, a country whose best writers were all formed before Castro rule. He offers us an off-the-beaten-path visit of a relatively closed society, a prose that is free of propaganda (though not liberated from surveillance). By occupying a small but significant critical space in Cuba, Padura becomes more interesting for Cuba observers and more intriguing for students of cultural and literary trends in the island.\" \nPadura is best known in the English-speaking world for his quartet of detective novels featuring lieutenant Mario Conde. Collectively titled \"Las cuatro estaciones\" (\"The four seasons\"), sometimes called \"The Havana Quartet\" in their English translations. Conde is a cop who would rather be a writer, and admits to feelings of \"solidarity with writers, crazy people, and drunkards\". These books are set respectively in winter, spring, summer and autumn (\"Vientos de cuaresma\" literally means \"Lenten Winds\" and \"Paisaje de otoño\", Autumn landscape):\n\nThe four books were made into four Spanish language television films, which have been released with English subtitles as the Netflix mini-series \"Four Seasons in Havana\". An English-language remake named \"Havana Quartet\" was considered by Starz with Antonio Banderas tagged to act as Conde, but it did not proceed beyond the development stage.\n\n\"Paisaje de otoño\" won the 1998 Premio Hammett of the Asociación Internacional de Escritores Policiacos (International Association of Crime Writers); this prize should not be confused with the similarly named Hammett Prize given by the North American branch of the organization, which is restricted to United States and Canadian authors.\n\nPadura has published two subsequent books featuring Conde, the novella \"Adiós Hemingway\" (Padura’s first book to be translated into English, in 2005), and a recent novel \"La neblina del ayer\" (\"The Fog of Yesterday\", translated into English as \"Havana Fever\"). The Havana-Cultura website comments on the similarities and differences between Padura and Hemingway and how they might explain his decision to feature the expatriate American in \"Adiós Hemingway\".\n\nPadura's novel \"El hombre que amaba a los perros\" (The Man Who Loved Dogs) deals with the murder of Leon Trotsky and the man who assassinated him, Ramon Mercader. At almost 600 pages, it is his most accomplished work and the result of more than five years of meticulous historical research. The novel, published in September 2009, attracted a lot of publicity mainly because of its political theme. The novel centres \"on Stalin’s murderous obsession with Leon Trotsky, an intellectual architect of the Russian Revolution and the founder of the Red Army\", and considers \"how revolutionary utopias devolve into totalitarian dystopias.\"\n\nPadura's books are also available in French (including all the books featuring Conde), Italian, Portuguese, German, Greek and Danish.\n\n\n\"How to Write from Mantilla, or the Small Heresies of Leonardo Padura,\" chapter 5 in Yvon Grenier, \"Culture and the Cuban State, Participation, Recognition, and Dissonance under Communism\" (Lexington Books, 2017).\n\n\n"}

The image's text is often idiosyncratic and grammatically incorrect, and is known as \"lolspeak\".\n\nLolcat is a compound word of the acronymic abbreviation for LOL (laugh out loud) and the word cat. A synonym for lolcat is cat macro or cat meme, since the images are a type of image macro and also a well-known genre of meme. Lolcats are commonly designed for photo sharing imageboards and other Internet forums.\n\nBritish portrait photographer Harry Pointer created a carte de visite series featuring cats posed in various situations in the early 1870s. To these he usually added amusing text intended to further enhance their appeal. Other notable early figures include Harry Whittier Frees and (using mounted animals) Walter Potter.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term \"lolcat\" is from the anonymous imageboard 4chan. The word \"Lolcat\" was in use as early as June 2006, and the domain name \"LOLcats.com\" was registered on June 14, 2006. Their popularity was spread through usage on forums such as Something Awful. \"The News Journal\" states that \"some trace the lolcats back to the site 4chan, which features bizarre cat pictures on Saturdays, or 'Caturdays'.\" Ikenburg adds that the images have been \"slinking around the Internet for years under various labels, but they did not become a sensation until early 2007 with the advent of I Can Has Cheezburger?\" The first image on \"I CAN HAZ CHEEZBURGER?\" was posted on January 11, 2007, and was allegedly from the Something Awful website.\" Lev Grossman of \"Time\" wrote that the oldest known example \"probably dates to 2006\", but later corrected himself in a blog post where he recapitulated the anecdotal evidence readers had sent him, placing the origin of \"Caturday\" and many of the images now known by a few as \"lolcats\" in early 2005. The domain name \"caturday.com\" was registered on April 30, 2005.\n\nThe term \"lolcat\" gained national media attention in the United States when it was covered by \"Time\", which wrote that non-commercialized phenomena of the sort are increasingly rare, stating that lolcats have \"a distinctly old-school, early 1990s, Usenet feel to [them]\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" put them on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Da cutest distractshun of da decaid? Y, lolcats of corse! We can neber haz enuf of deez capshioned pics of cuddlie kittehs.\" \"Lolcat\" was also a runner-up under the \"Most Creative\" category under the American Dialect Society Word of the Year Awards, losing out to\n\"Googlegänger\".\n\nIn December 2014, the word \"lolcat\" entered the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", appearing in its online version.\n\nLolcat is a composite of two words, \"lol\" and \"cat\". \"Lol\" stands for \"Laugh out Loud\" or \"Laughing out Loud\"; hence, lolcats are intended to be funny and to include jokes. Lolcats images comprise a photo of a cat with a large caption characteristically set in a heavy sans serif font such as Impact or Arial Black. The image is, on occasion, digitally edited for effect.\n\nThe caption generally acts as a speech balloon encompassing a comment from the cat, or as a description of the depicted scene. The caption is intentionally written with deviations from standard English spelling and grammar, featuring \"conjugated verbs, but a tendency to converge to a new set of rules in spelling and grammar\".\nThe text parodies the grammar-poor patois stereotypically attributed to Internet slang. Frequently, lolcat captions take the form of phrasal templates. Some phrases have a known source, usually a well-known Internet meme, such as All your base are belong to us or Do not want, while others don't. The language of lolcats has also been likened to baby talk, however it draws on a variety of linguistic resources, not just the imitation of baby talk.\n\nCommon themes include jokes of the form \"Im in ur [noun], [verb]-ing ur [related noun].\" Many lolcat images capture cats performing characteristically human actions or appearing to use modern technology, such as computers.\n\nThere are several well-known lolcat images and single-word captions that have spawned many variations and imitations, including \"Ceiling Cat\" (see below). Others include Fail (a cat with a slice of processed cheese on its face) and \"I Can Has Cheezburger\" (a portrait of a blue British Shorthair). Another popular format is \"[Adjective] cat is [adjective/noun].\"\n\n\"Ceiling Cat\" is a character spawned by the meme. The original image was an image macro with a picture of a cat looking out of a hole in a ceiling, captioned \"Ceiling Cat is watching you masturbate.\" There followed numerous examples with the format \"Ceiling Cat is watching you [\"verb\" ending in / rhyming with -ate]\" with Ceiling Cat superimposed in the upper left hand corner of an image macro depicting the appropriate action. The underlying theme is that the cat is looking down on one, almost in a form of judgement. \"Ceiling Cat\" and the corresponding \"Basement Cat\" (a black cat who lives in the basement) represent good and evil in the lolcat universe, and in some cases God and Satan, as in the LOLCat Bible Translation Project.\n\nVariations on the lolcat concept include captioning photos of other animals in a similar style (e.g. \"loldogs\" for dogs, etc.).\n\nThe syntax of lolcat captions was used as the basis for LOLCODE, an esoteric programming language with interpreters and compilers available in .NET Framework, Perl, etc.\n\nIn the game Minecraft, there is an option to change language settings to LOLCAT.\n\nAnother example is Polandball, which uses broken English, reminiscent of the lolcat meme.\n\n\n\n"}

It shares several features with Juba Arabic and Nubi Creole: a complete lack of inflection, including articles, possessive markers, and agreement; a single negative marker; \"ʔmny\" for the third-person dual pronoun, and perhaps the use of \"jaʿal\" 'make' rather than colloquial \"qaʿad\" 'stay' for the progressive. \n\nIt is not known where \"Maridi\" was.

{"id": "1417407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1417407", "title": "Old Norwegian", "text": "Old Norwegian\n\nOld Norwegian (Norwegian: \"gammelnorsk\" and \"gam(m)alnorsk\"), also called Norwegian Norse, is an early form of the Norwegian language that was spoken between the 11th and 14th century; it is a transitional stage between Old West Norse and Middle Norwegian, and also Old Norn and Old Faroese.\nIts distinction from Old West Norse is a matter of convention.\nTraditionally, Old Norwegian has been divided into the main dialect areas of North Western, Outer South Western, Inner South Western, Trøndersk, North Eastern, and South Eastern.\n\nOne of the most important early differences between Old Norwegian and Old Icelandic is that \"h\" in the consonant combinations \"hl-\", \"hn-\" and \"hr-\" was lost in Old Norwegian around the 11th century, while being preserved in Old Icelandic. Thus, one has e.g. Old Icelandic \"hlíð\" 'slope', \"hníga\" 'curtsey' and \"hringr\" 'ring' vs Old Norwegian \"líð\", \"níga\" and \"ringr\", respectively.\n\nMany Old Norwegian dialects feature a height based system of vowel harmony: Following stressed high vowels (/i/, /iː/, /y/, /yː/, /u/, /uː/) and diphthongs (/ei/, /ey/, /au/), the unstressed vowels /i/ and /u/ appear as \"i\", \"u\", while they are represented as \"e\", \"o\" following long non-high vowels (/eː/, /øː/, /oː/, /æː/, /aː/). The situation following stressed short non-high vowels (/e/, /æ/, /ø/, /a/, /o/, /ɔ/) is much debated and was apparently different in the individual dialects.\n\nThe \"u\"-umlaut of short /a/ (written \"ǫ\" in normalized Old Norse) is not as consistently graphically distinguished from non-umlauted /a/ as in Old Icelandic, especially in writings from the Eastern dialect areas. It is still a matter of academic debate whether this is to be interpreted phonologically as a lack of umlaut or merely as a lack of its graphical representation.\n\nOld Norwegian had alternative dual and plural first person pronouns, \"mit,\" \"mér,\" to the Common Norse \"vit,\" \"vér.\"\n\nThe Black Death struck Norway in 1349, killing over 60% of the population. This probably precipitated the current process of language development. The language in Norway after 1350 up to about 1550 is generally referred to as Middle Norwegian. The language went through several changes: morphological paradigms were simplified, including the loss of grammatical cases and the levelling of personal inflection on verbs. A vowel reduction also took place, in some dialects, including in parts of Norway, reducing many final unstressed vowels in a word to a common \"e\".\n\nThe phonemic inventory also underwent changes. The dental fricatives represented by the letters þ and ð disappeared from the Norwegian language, either merging with their equivalent stop consonants, represented by t and d, respectively, or being lost altogether.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2281137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281137", "title": "Ostanes", "text": "Ostanes\n\nOstanes (from [iran]] ), also spelled Hostanes and Osthanes, was the pen-name used by several pseudo-anonymous authors of iran and Latin works from Hellenistic period onwards. Together with Pseudo-Zoroaster and Pseudo-Hystaspes, Ostanes belongs to the group of pseudepigraphical \"Hellenistic Magians\", that is, a long line of Greek and other Hellenistic writers who wrote \"under the name of\" famous \"Magians\". While Pseudo-Zoroaster was identified as the \"inventor\" of astrology, and Pseudo-Hystaspes was stereotyped as an apocalyptic prophet, Ostanes was imagined to be a master sorcerer.\n\nUnlike \"Zoroaster\" and \"Hystaspes\", which have well attested Iranian language counterparts, for \"Ostanes\" there is \"no evidence of a figure of a similar name in Iranian tradition.\" In the \"Encyclopedia Iranica\" entry for Ostanes, Morton Smith cites Justi's \"Namensbuch\" for instances of the name which refer to real persons. Smith: \"Which [of these references to] Ostanes (...), if any, gave rise to the legend of the magus is uncertain.\"\n\nSmith goes on to reconstruct the Old Iranian name as *(H)uštāna. The Justi entries that Smith alludes to are: Diodorus 17.5.5 and Plutarch \"Artax.\" 1.1.5 (cit. Ktesias) for Ὀστάνης as the name of one of the sons of Darius Nothos, and a mention in Arrian (\"An.\" 4.22) of a certain Αὐστάνης of Paraetakene, north-east of Bactria, who was captured by Alexander's general Krateros and then taken to India. Arrian's Αὐστάνης is Haustanes in Curtius 8.5. Ktesias names 'Άρτόστης' as the son of Darius Nothus, and Justi suggests that Plutarch confused Artostes as Ostanes.\n\nThe origins of the figure of \"Ostanes\", or rather, who the Greeks imagined him to be, lies within the framework of \"alien wisdom\" that the Greeks (and later Romans) ascribed to famous foreigners, many of whom were famous to the Greeks even before being co-opted as authors of arcana. One of these names was that of (pseudo-)Zoroaster, whom the Greeks perceived to be the founder of the magi and of their \"magi\"cal arts. Another name was that of (pseudo-)Hystaspes, Zoroaster's patron. The third of \"les Mages hellénisés\" was Ostanes, imaginatively described by the 4th century BCE Hermodorus (apud Diogenes Laertius \"Prooemium\" 2) as being a magus in the long line of magi descending from Zoroaster.\n\nOnce the magi had been associated with \"magic\"—Greek \"magikos\"—it was but a natural progression that the Greek's image of Zoroaster would metamorphose into a magician too. The 1st century CE Pliny the Elder names \"Zoroaster\" as the inventor of magic (\"Natural History\" .2.3), but a \"principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds. That dubious honor went to another fabulous magus, Ostanes, to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed.\" Thus, while \"universal consensus\"—so the skeptical Pliny—was that magic began with (pseudo-)Zoroaster (xxx.2.3), as far as Pliny says he could determine, \"Ostanes\" was the first extant writer of it (xxx.2.8).\n\nThis 'Ostanes', so Pliny states, was a Persian magus who had accompanied Xerxes in his invasion of Greece, and who had then introduced \"magicis\", the \"most fraudulent of the arts\", to that country. But the figure of Ostanes was such that Pliny felt \"it necessary to supplement his history with doppelgangers\"; so, not only does Ostanes appear as a contemporary of the early 5th century BCE Xerxes, but he is also contemporary with—and companion of—the late 4th century BCE Alexander. Pliny goes on to note that Ostanes's introduction of the \"monstrous craft\" to the Greeks gave those people not only a \"lust\" (\"aviditatem\") for magic, but a downright \"madness\" (\"rabiem\") for it, and many of their philosophers, such as Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato traveled abroad to study it, and then returned to teach it.(xxx.2.8-10).\n\nPliny also transmits Ostanes's definition of magic: \"As Ostanes said, there are several different kinds of it; he professes to divine (\"divina promittit\") from water, globes, air, stars, lamps, basins and axes, and by many other methods, and besides to converse with ghosts and those in the underworld\" (xxx.2.8-10). By the end of the 1st century CE, \"Ostanes\" is cited as an authority on alchemy, necromancy, divination, and on the mystical properties of plants and stones. Both his legend and literary output attributed to him increased with time, and by the 4th century \"he had become one of the great authorities in alchemy\" and \"much medieval alchemical material circulated under his name.\"\n\nThis \"authority\" continued in Arabic and Persian alchemical literature, such as an Arabic treatise titled \"Kitab al-Fusul al-ithnay ‘ashar fi 'ilm al-hajar al-mukarram\" (\"The Book of the Twelve Chapters on the Honourable Stone\").\n\n"}

Today, however, plankowner is often applied to members of newly commissioned units, new military bases and recommissioning crews as well.\n\nPlankowner is a term used by the United States Navy, and has consequently been variously defined by different units. The origin of the term is the implication that a crew member was around when the ship was being built and commissioned, and therefore has bragging rights to the \"ownership\" of one of the planks in the main deck.\n\nHistorically, a plankowner in the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard, or his widow, could petition the Naval Historical Center's Curator Branch for a piece of the deck when the ship was decommissioned. This practice has been discontinued and stocks of planking that existed at the Curator branch have been donated to various veteran's organizations.\n\nSailors who are plankowners at their current command often have the word \"PLANKOWNER\" embroidered on the back of their uniform ball cap to denote this designation.

Contextomies may be both intentional, as well as accidental if someone misunderstands the meaning and omits something essential to clarifying it, thinking it to be non-essential.\n\nArguments based on this fallacy typically take two forms:\n\nContextomy refers to the selective excerpting of words from their original linguistic context in a way that distorts the source's intended meaning, a practice commonly referred to as \"quoting out of context\". The problem here is not the removal of a quote from its original context \"per se\" (as all quotes are), but to the quoter's decision to exclude from the excerpt certain nearby phrases or sentences (which become \"context\" by virtue of the exclusion) that serve to clarify the intentions behind the selected words. Comparing this practice to surgical excision, journalist Milton Mayer coined the term \"contextomy\" to describe its use by Julius Streicher, editor of the infamous Nazi broadsheet \"Der Stürmer\" in Weimar-era Germany. To arouse anti-semitic sentiments among the weekly's working class Christian readership, Streicher regularly published truncated quotations from Talmudic texts that, in their shortened form, appear to advocate greed, slavery, and ritualistic murder. Although rarely employed to this malicious extreme, contextomy is a common method of misrepresentation in contemporary mass media, and studies have demonstrated that the effects of this misrepresentation can linger even after the audience is exposed to the original, in context, quote.\n\nOne of the most familiar examples of contextomy is the ubiquitous \"review blurb\" in advertising. The lure of media exposure associated with being \"blurbed\" by a major studio may encourage some critics to write positive reviews of mediocre movies. However, even when a review is negative overall, studios have few reservations about excerpting it in a way that misrepresents the critic's opinion.\n\nFor example, the ad copy for New Line Cinema's 1995 thriller \"Se7en\" attributed to Owen Gleiberman, a critic for \"Entertainment Weekly\", used the comment \"a small masterpiece.\" Gleiberman actually gave \"Se7en\" a B− overall and only praised the opening credits so grandiosely: \"The credit sequence, with its jumpy frames and near-subliminal flashes of psychoparaphernalia, is a small masterpiece of dementia.\" Similarly, United Artists contextomized critic Kenneth Turan's review of their flop \"Hoodlum\", including just one word from it—\"irresistible\"—in the film's ad copy: \"Even Laurence Fishburne's incendiary performance can't ignite \"Hoodlum\", a would-be gangster epic that generates less heat than a nickel cigar. Fishburne's 'Bumpy' is fierce, magnetic, irresistible even… But even this actor can only do so much.\" As a result of these abuses, some critics now deliberately avoid colorful language in their reviews. In 2010, the pop culture magazine \"Vanity Fair\" reported that it had been the victims of \"reckless blurbing\" after the television show \"Lost\" had taken a review fragment of \"the most confusing, asinine, ridiculous—yet somehow addictively awesome—television show of all time\" and only quoted \"the most addictively awesome television show of all time\" in its promotional material. Carl Bialik recorded an instance of an adverb being applied to a different verb in a 2007 advert for \"Live Free or Die Hard\", where a \"New York Daily News\" quote of \"hysterically overproduced and surprisingly entertaining\" was reduced to \"hysterically... entertaining\".\n\nIn the United States, there is no specific law against misleading movie blurbs, beyond existing regulation over false advertising. The MPAA reviews advertisements for tone and content rather than the accuracy of their citations. Some studios seek approval from the original critic before running a condensed quotation. The European Union's Unfair Commercial Practices Directive prohibits contextomy, and targets companies who \"falsely claim accreditation\" for their products in ways that are \"not being true to the terms of the [original] endorsement\". It is enforced in the United Kingdom by the Office of Fair Trading, and carries a maximum penalty there of a £5,000 fine or two years imprisonment.\n\nScientists and their supporters used the term \"quote mining\" as early as the mid-1990s in newsgroup posts to describe quoting practices of certain creationists. The term is used by members of the scientific community to describe a method employed by creationists to support their arguments, though it can be and often is used outside of the creation–evolution controversy. Complaints about the practice predate known use of the term: Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote in his famous 1973 essay \"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution\": \n\nThis has been compared to the Christian theological method of prooftexting:\nThe Institute for Creation Research (ICR) described the use of \"[a]n evolutionist's quote mistakenly used out of context\" to \"negate the entirety of [an] article and creationist claims regarding the lack of transitional forms\" as \"a smoke screen\".\n\nBoth Answers in Genesis (AiG) and Henry M. Morris (founder of ICR) have been accused of producing books of mined quotes. \"TalkOrigins Archive\" (TOA) states that \"entire books of these quotes have been published\" and lists prominent creationist Henry M. Morris' \"That Their Words May Be Used Against Them\" and \"The Revised Quote Book\" as examples, in addition to a number of online creationist lists of quote-mines. Both AiG and ICR use the following quote from Stephen Jay Gould on intermediate forms.\n\nContext shows that Gould rejected the gradualists' explanation for the lack of support for gradual change in favor of his own interpretation. He continues:\nKnowing that creationists are quoting him as if he were saying there were no transitional forms, Gould responded:\nSince the mid-1990s, scientists and their supporters have used the term \"quote mining\" to describe versions of this practice as used by certain creationists in the creation-evolution controversy. An example found in debates over evolution is an out-of-context quotation of Charles Darwin in his \"Origin of Species\":\n\nThis sentence, sometimes truncated to the phrase \"absurd in the highest degree\", is often presented as part of an assertion that Darwin himself believed that natural selection could not fully account for the complexity of life. However, Darwin went on to explain that the apparent absurdity of the evolution of an eye is no bar to its occurrence, and elaborates on its evolution.\n\nThe quote in context is\n\nBesides the creation-evolution controversy, the fallacy of quoting out of context is also used in other areas. In some instances, commentators have used the term \"quote mining\", comparing the practice of others with creationist quote mining.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25713415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25713415", "title": "Realia (library science)", "text": "Realia (library science)\n\nIn library classification systems, realia are three-dimensional objects from real life such as coins, tools, and textiles, that do not easily fit into the orderly categories of printed material. They can be either man-made (artifacts, tools, utensils, etc.) or naturally occurring (specimens, samples, etc.), usually borrowed, purchased, or received as donation by a teacher, library, or museum for use in classroom instruction or in exhibits. Archival and manuscript collections often receive items of memorabilia such as badges, emblems, insignias, jewelry, leather goods, needlework, etc., in connection with gifts of personal papers. Most government or institutional archives reject gifts of non-documentary objects unless they have a documentary value. When accepting large bequests of mixed objects they normally have the donors sign legal documents giving permission to the archive to destroy, exchange, sell or dispose in any way those objects which, according to the best judgement of the archivist, are not manuscripts (which can include typescripts or printouts) or are not immediately useful for understanding the manuscripts.\n\nMost libraries usually have a very well written, legally tight, acquisitions policy which rejects beforehand any object which is not some kind of document. There are some exceptions. Children's libraries sometimes have a toy collection, whose individual items are lent out after being cataloged as realia, or under a more specific material designation such as toy, or game. Some large libraries can have a special mandate of keeping objects related to a literary collection or very large libraries can have a public relations department which can find museum objects useful for enhancing or promoting the general collection. Such a library is more likely to prize realia for their associations with writers, subjects, or themes in the library's collection rather than for their own intrinsic worth, artistic merit, historical significance, or scientific value. Examples might include a feather pen believed to have been owned by John Hancock, lead type from Benjamin Franklin's printing press, or a collection of Vietnam era canteens, mess kits, uniforms, combat boots, etc. used in an \"hands on\" exhibit for children to illustrate the Vietnam War.\n\nWithin the very restricted domain of cataloging rules in the field of Library and information science the term \"realia\" is used to describe those mass-produced objects which incorporate documents or significant amounts of text (such as world globes, decks of quiz cards, board games), but which have a format which makes it hard to incorporate them in the general collection or to describe them easily in the catalog. Special cataloguing rules are available to describe these objects.\n\nObjects of realia, due to their diverse and compound nature, pose unique preservation challenges for libraries and archives. Unlike books and other traditional library materials, the artifactual value of these materials is key. In fact, when such items are unaccompanied by written documentation, as is often the case, the intellectual value sought by most library collections is often uncertain.\n\n“We have a lot of hair,” Saundra Taylor of the Lilly Library told ‘’The New York Times’’, explaining that realia such as locks of hair, toys, and inkwells, are often the unsolicited accompaniment to prized acquisitions of personal papers or book collections. Some libraries prize their realia, actively preserving and exhibiting it while others simply keep it out of light and hope for the best.\n\nOften, realia are seen as a nuisance, difficult not only to catalog, but to care for. Unlike books, which are mostly cellulose (paper, boards, natural fibers) and occasionally leather, realia are often the sum of many parts. One exasperating group of items that might find their way into library collections are textiles and handcrafts: hair, needlework, clothing.\n\nLittle research has been conducted regarding the preservation and conservation of human hair within the context of the archival world. However, much is known of the chemical structure and behavior of human hair, thanks in large part to the cosmetology industry; there is certainly a great deal of scholarship surrounding the care of other protein-based fibers, silk and wool.\n\nLoose, braided, tied lovingly in silk ribbons, hair was memorialized especially by the Victorians. Often, hair would be encased within a glass or woven with metallic threads, paired with a metal setting to be worn as mourning jewelry, a memento of a friend or loved one. Hairwork, an art still practiced today by the Victorian Hairwork Society, was a popular needlework method, often resulting in 2-dimensional mourning wreaths and graveyard scenes, worked in hair on a fabric ground. Wool, because of its ability to wick moisture and resist flame, was commonly used in Western textiles throughout history, and might present itself in the form of bedlinens, clothing, and needlework.\n\nHair (both human and animal) mainly consists of a protein, keratin, the fibers of which give the inner core of hair a great deal of strength. Hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds link the chained amino acids that make up hair. Hydrogen bonds break and re-form easily on exposure to water, but disulfide bonds (responsible for curl, among other properties), can be broken only via chemical means. Under examination with a microspectrophotometer, scientists have discovered that high heat, UV exposure, and even artificial lighting can be quite damaging to human hair.\nWool, too, suffers in the sun—the fleece of sheep allowed to spend too much time in the sun before shearing accepts little dye when sheared from their backs, compared to their underbellies, as a result of disulfide bonds broken by UV light. Heat and a wide variety of insects, too, are deleterious to woolen textiles. Wool has a high resistance, however, to fungi and bacteria, provided it is free from sizing and soaps; further, wool can absorb three times its volume in water and requires a bit of humidity to remain viable.\n\nSilk, another protein-rich fiber, is the most problematic of textiles. Often “weighted” with metallic salts to produce a nicer drape in clothing, silks (especially black silks and silks used in trimmings) rarely hold up to washing and repeated handling. Unlike other proteins, silk is not flame retardant. It quickly becomes brittle when kept in hot, dry conditions, and is highly susceptible to rot when in warm, humid climes.\n\nCellulose fibers, like cotton, linen, and hemp behave differently from protein-based fibers. Linen and cotton, for instance, comprised most papers for many centuries. Clothing and handcrafts were often made with linen or cotton. Needlework was often done with silk, wool, or hair on a linen or cotton ground. Hairwork, silk embroidery, and wool embroidery pose special problems, due to the makeup of their parts. In diffused light, all fibers deteriorate rapidly, compared to those stored in the dark. However, cotton and linen resist temperature well. Cotton can be stored in temperatures well above 100 degrees and still remain chemically and physically stable. With these varying degrees of chemical and physical degradation, textiles woven from a blend of fibers, or art pieces created using a variety of fibers, deteriorate unevenly. Storage of wool and silk, for example in the ideal condition for one, might have a negative effect on the other.\n\nAll textiles react negatively to air pollution, light, extremes of temperature, and humidity. Rapid changes in the environment can cause undue stress for these natural fibers, causing them to expand and contract as they take on moisture if kept in humid conditions, to dry out in high heat. Chemical bonds are broken by the machinations of UV light and chemicals in polluted air. As with other, more traditional, library materials, temperature and humidity should be kept within a steady range if at all possible: 70 (+/- 5 degrees) degrees Fahrenheit and 50% (+/- 5%) relative humidity is suggested by most sources. Pre-conditioned silica gel used for the purpose of humidity control should never come into direct contact with textiles.\n\nTextiles should be stored in darkness, and exhibited in dim light with UV filtration. To avoid acid-migration, textiles should not come into contact with wood or cardboard. Acid-free tissue or muslin are often used to shield textiles from harmful lignins.\n\nStorage options for textiles are manifold. Small items, such as locks of hair, fragments of cloth, or lace can be stored flat, sandwiched between sheets of tissue or encapsulated in mylar. Larger items tend to deteriorate at points of stress, due to folding or gravity pulling the fibers from one another. Finch and Putnam recommend rolling on plastic tubing or covered cardboard, or shaping over dummies. Clothing is often stored or shaped around specially created forms that support the textile fully while it is displayed or even hanged.\n\n"}

{"id": "3863920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3863920", "title": "Repetition compulsion", "text": "Repetition compulsion\n\nRepetition compulsion is a psychological phenomenon in which a person repeats a traumatic event or its circumstances over and over again. This includes reenacting the event or putting oneself in situations where the event is likely to happen again. This \"re-living\" can also take the form of dreams in which memories and feelings of what happened are repeated, and even hallucination.\n\nThe term can also be used to cover the repetition of behaviour or life patterns more broadly: a \"key component in Freud's understanding of mental life, 'repetition compulsion' ... describes the pattern whereby people endlessly repeat patterns of behaviour which were difficult or distressing in earlier life\".\n\nSigmund Freud's use of the concept of \"repetition compulsion\" () was 'articulated ... for the first time, in the article of 1914, \"Erinnern, Wiederholen und Durcharbeiten\" (\"Remembering, Repeating and Working-Through\")'. Here he noted how 'the patient does not \"remember\" anything of what he has forgotten and repressed, he \"acts\" it out, without, of course, knowing that he is repeating it ... For instance, the patient does not say that he remembers that he used to be defiant and critical toward his parents' authority; instead, he behaves in that way to the doctor'.\n\nHe explored the repetition compulsion further in his 1920 essay \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\", describing four aspects of repetitive behavior, all of which seemed odd to him from the point of view of the mind's quest for pleasure/avoidance of unpleasure.\n\nThe first was the way 'dreams occurring in traumatic neuroses have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident' rather than, for example, 'show[ing] the patient pictures from his healthy past'.\n\nThe second came from children's play. Freud reported observing a child throw his favorite toy from his crib, become upset at the loss, then reel the toy back in, only to repeat this action. Freud theorized that the child was attempting to master the sensation of loss 'in allowing his mother to go away without protesting', but asked in puzzlement 'How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?'.\n\nThe third was the way (noted in 1914) that the patient, exploring in therapy a repressed past, 'is obliged to \"repeat\" the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of ... \"remembering\" it as something belonging to the past ... the compulsion to repeat the events of his childhood in the transference evidently disregards the pleasure principle in \"every\" way'.\n\nThe fourth was the so-called \"destiny neurosis\", manifested in 'the life-histories of men and women ... [as] an essential character-trait which remains always the same and which is compelled to find expression in a repetition of the same experience'.\n\nAll such activities appeared to Freud to contradict the organism's search for pleasure, and therefore 'to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that seems more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides': 'a daemonic current/trait', 'a daemonic character', a 'daemonic compulsion', likely alluding to the Latin motto \"errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum\" (\"to err is human, to persist [in committing such errors] is of the devil\"). Following this line of thought, he would come to stress that \"'an instinct is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things\"'; and so to arrive eventually at his concept of the death drive.\n\nAlong the way, however, Freud had in addition considered a variety of more purely psychological explanations for the phenomena of the repetition compulsion which he had observed. Traumatic repetitions could be seen as the result of an attempt to retrospectively \"master\" the original trauma, a child's play as an attempt to turn passivity into activity: 'At the outset he was in a \"passive\" situation ... but by repeating it, unpleasurable though it was, as a game, he took on an \"active\" part'.\n\nAt the same time, the repetition of unpleasant experiences in analysis could be considered 'unpleasure for one system and simultaneously satisfaction for the other . In the second edition of 1921, he extended the point, stating explicitly that transference repetitions 'are of course the activities of instincts intended to lead to satisfaction; but no lesson has been learnt from the old experience of these activities having led only to unpleasure'.\n\nFive years later, in \"Inhibition, Symptom and Anxiety\", he would quietly revise his earlier definition—'There is no need to be discouraged by these emendations ... so long as they enrich rather than invalidate our earlier views'—in his new formula on 'the power of the compulsion to repeat—the attraction exerted by the unconscious prototypes upon the repressed instinctual process'.\n\nIt was in the latter, psychological form that the concept of the repetition compulsion passed into the psychoanalytic mainstream. Otto Fenichel in his \"second generation\" compendium \"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis\" stressed two main kinds of neurotic repetition.\n\nOn the one hand, there were \"'Repetitions of traumatic events for the purpose of achieving a belated mastery\" ... seen first and most clearly in children's games', although the 'same pattern occurs in the repetitive dreams and symptoms of traumatic neurotics and in many similar little actions of normal persons who ... repeat upsetting experiences a number of times before these experiences are mastered. Such traumatic repetitions could themselves appear in active or passive forms. In a passive form, one chooses his or her most familiar experiences consistently as a means to deal with problems of the past, believing that new experiences will be more painful than their present situation or too new and untested to imagine. In the active, participatory form, a person actively engages in behavior that mimics an earlier stressor, either deliberately or unconsciously, so that in particular events that are terrifying in childhood become sources of attraction in adulthood. For instance, a person who was spanked as a child may incorporate this into their adult sexual practices; or a victim of sexual abuse may attempt to seduce another person of authority in his or her life (such as their boss or therapist): an attempt at \"mastery\" of their feelings and experience, in the sense that they unconsciously want to go through the same situation but that it \"not\" result negatively as it did in the past.\n\nOn the other hand, there were \"'Repetitions due to the tendency of the repressed to find an outlet\"'. Here the drive of the repressed impulse to find gratification brought with it a renewal of the original defence: 'the anxiety that first brought about the repression is mobilized again and creates, together with the repetition of the impulse, a repetition of the anti-instinctual measures'. Fenichel considered that 'Neurotic repetitions of this kind contain no metaphysical element', and 'even the repetition of the most painful failure of the Oedipus complex in the transference during a psychoanalytic cure is not \"beyond the pleasure principle\"'.\n\nLater writers would take very similar views. Eric Berne saw as central to his work 'the repetition compulsion which drives men to their doom, the power of death, according to Freud ... [who] places it in some mysterious biological sphere, when after all it is only the voice of seduction'—the seduction of the repressed and unconscious id.\n\nErik Erikson saw the destiny neurosis—the way 'that some people make the same mistakes over and over'—in the same light: 'the individual unconsciously arranges for variations of an original theme which he has not learned either to overcome or to live with'. Ego psychology would subsequently take for granted 'how rigidly determined our lives are—how predictable and repetitive ... the same mistake over and over again'.\n\nObject relations theory, stressing the way 'the transference is a live relationship ... in the here-and-now of the analysis, repeating the way that the patient has used his objects from early in life' considered that 'this newer conception reveals a purpose ... [in] the repetition compulsion': thus 'unconscious hope may be found in repetition compulsion, when unresolved conflicts continue to generate attempts at solutions which do not really work ... [until] a genuine solution is found'.\n\nBy the close of the twentieth century, the psychoanalytic view of repetition compulsion had come into increasing dialogue with a variety of other discourses, ranging from attachment theory through brief psychodynamic therapy to cognitive behavioural therapy.\n\nAttachment theory saw early developmental experiences leading to 'schemas or mental representations of relationship ... [which] become organized, encoded experiential and cognitive data ... that lead to self-confirmation'.\n\nThe Core Conflictual Relationship Theme—'core wishes that the individual has in relation to others'—was seen in brief psychodynamic therapy as linked to the way in 'a repetition compulsion, the client will behave in ways that engender particular responses from others that conform with previous experiences in interpersonal relationships'.\n\nIn 'psychological schemas' described in social psychology or cognitive-behavioural psychology ... 'an enduring symbolic framework that organizes constellations of thought, feeling, memory, and expectation about self and others\" (Knapp 1991: 94)', further parallels may be seen to the role of early unconscious fixations in fueling the repetition compulsion.\n\n\n\n"}

Software archaeology, named by analogy with archaeology, includes the reverse engineering of software modules, and the application of a variety of tools and processes for extracting and understanding program structure and recovering design information. Software archaeology may reveal dysfunctional team processes which have produced poorly designed or even unused software modules. The term has been in use for decades, and reflects a fairly natural metaphor: a programmer reading legacy code may feel that he or she is in the same situation as an archaeologist exploring the rubble of an ancient civilization.\n\nA workshop on Software Archaeology at the 2001 OOPSLA (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications) conference identified the following software archaeology techniques, some of which are specific to object-oriented programming:\n\nMore generally, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas note the importance of version control, dependency management, text indexing tools such as GLIMPSE and SWISH-E, and \"[drawing] a map as you begin exploring.\"\n\nLike true archaeology, software archaeology involves investigative work to understand the thought processes of one's predecessors. At the OOPSLA workshop, Ward Cunningham suggested a synoptic signature analysis technique which gave an overall \"feel\" for a program by showing only punctuation, such as semicolons and curly braces. In the same vein, Cunningham has suggested viewing programs in 2 point font in order to understand the overall structure. Another technique identified at the workshop was the use of aspect-oriented programming tools such as AspectJ to systematically introduce tracing code without directly editing the legacy program.\n\nNetwork and temporal analysis techniques can reveal the patterns of collaborative activity by the developers of legacy software, which in turn may shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the software artifacts produced.\n\nMichael Rozlog of Embarcadero Technologies has described software archaeology as a six-step process which enables programmers to answer questions such as \"What have I just inherited?\" and \"Where are the scary sections of the code?\" These steps, similar to those identified by the OOPSLA workshop, include using visualization to obtain a visual representation of the program's design, using software metrics to look for design and style violations, using unit testing and profiling to look for bugs and performance bottlenecks, and assembling design information recovered by the process. Software archaeology can also be a service provided to programmers by external consultants.\nMitch Rosenberg of InfoVentions.net, Inc. claims that the first law of software archaeology (he calls it code or data archaeology) is:\n\n\"Everything that is there is there for a reason, and there are 3 possible reasons:\"\n\n\"The corollary to this \"law\" is that, until you know which was the reason, you should NOT modify the code (or data).\"\n\nSoftware archaeology has continued to be a topic of discussion at more recent software engineering conferences.\n\nThe profession of \"programmer–archaeologist\" features prominently in Vernor Vinge's \"A Deepness in the Sky.\" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "42245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42245", "title": "Sudovian language", "text": "Sudovian language\n\nSudovian (also known as Yotvingian, Yatvingian, or Jatvingian) is an extinct western Baltic language of Northeastern Europe. Closely related to the Old Prussian language, it was formerly spoken southwest of the Nemunas river in what is now Lithuania, east of Galindia and north of Yotvingia, and by exiles in East Prussia.\n\nSudovia and neighboring Galindia were two Baltic tribes or nations mentioned by the Greek geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD as \"Galindai\" and \"Soudinoi\", (Γαλίνδαι, Σουδινοί). Although Sudovian and Yotvingian were separate dialects of the same language, Sudovian and Yotvingian merged as a common dialect in the 10th century when the two nations created a Federation together with the Dainavians (\"Dainowe\", \"Deynowe\", \"Denowe\", i.e. of Dainava). \n\nPeter of Dusburg, in his 14th-century \"Chronicon terrae Prussiae\", refers to Sudovia and to its inhabitants as \"Sudovites\".\n\nAfter the district was conquered by the Teutonic Knights, the language died out and its speakers were gradually absorbed by German, Lithuanian and Slavic populations.\n\nThe language has six grammatical cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative and locative, and a complex morphology with a variety of moods. It was a frontier dialect of Old Baltic, which preserved many archaic features which had been lost in the Middle Baltic group.\n\nSudovian was very similar to and mutually intelligible with the archaic Old Prussian language, as stated in the introduction to the 1st Old Prussian Catechism (printed in Königsberg – 1545 – the 1st Baltic language book):\n\n\"Die Sudawen aber wiewol ihre rede etwas nyderiger wissen sich doch inn diese preüßnische sprach : wie sie alhie im Catechismo gedruckt ist auch wol zuschicken und vernemen alle wort\" – \"But the Sudovians, although their speech is somewhat lower, understand this Prussian language, as it is printed in the Catechism, and they express themselves well and understand every word\".\n\nThere are also some Sudovian language phrases in \"Warhafftige Beschreibung der Sudawen auff Samland sambt ihren Bock heyligen und Ceremonien\" – True Description of the Sudovians in Samland together with their goat sanctifications and ceremonies – written in the mid-16th century by Hieronymus Meletius.\n\n\nJohn Poliander wrote in 1535 about the Sudovians living near Königsberg, Prussia, that 32 villages used \"Sudini speech\" in a 6-7 mile stretch of land of the Samland Corner that bears the name of Sudavia. They spoke a language similar to the Old Prussian language, but they used the term \"gentaras\" for amber, not the Samlandish (Old Prussian) term. From him we learn that the Sudovians lived secluded from the Samlandish, that they married within their own tribe, and did not allow intermarriage with the neighbouring Prussian population \"even if begged\". They stubbornly held to their own traditions, and wore finger and ear rings with bronze bells and silver belts. Nothing was imported from abroad, but everything was produced by local craftsmen. Christoph Hartknoch reported in 1684 that there were still Sudovians there.\n\nThe Constit. Synod. Evangel. of 1530 contains the following list of deities who were still worshipped by the Sudavians in Samland: \"\"Occopirmus, Sualxtix, Ausschauts, Autrympus, Potrympus, Bardoayts, Piluuytis, Parcunas, Pecols\"...\" (Hastings, p 488)\n\nToponyms from N.E. Poland, N.W. Belarus, and Lithuania also preserve words.\nSudovian was influenced by the Gothic language, as was Old Prussian. As did other West Baltic dialects, it preserved the nominative singular neuter case ending - an absent from Latvian and Lithuanian. In the declension of nouns, five cases are the same as in Old Prussian: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative. The vocative example \"Kails naussen gnigethe.\" is listed above. The noun declension was very conservative and preserved many archaic features.\n\nThe Yotvingian territories of Sudovia and Galindia were later overrun and populated by Slavs around present-day Białystok and Suwałki in north-eastern Poland and nearby Hrodna (formerly Grodno) in Belarus. Some elements of Baltic speech are still retained in the Belarus and Ukraine territory, owing to the sparse indigenous populations and resettlements of refugees from Lithuania. The dialect of Zietela (Belarusian Дзятлава, Russian Дятлово, Yiddish Zietil, Polish Zdzięcioł) was of particular interest. Kazlauskas \"(1968, p. 285)\" suggested that the word \"mėnas\" (\"month\") (dative singular \"mënui\") encountered in dialects (Zietela, Lazdijai) and in the writings of Bretkūnas is a remnant of nouns with the stem suffix -s.\n\nUntil the 1970s, Yotvingian was chiefly known from toponyms and medieval Russian sources. But in 1978, a monument with Yotvingian writing was discovered by accident. In Belarus, a young man named Vyacheslav Zinov, an amateur collector, bought a book of Catholic prayers from an old man from village in the depths of Białowieża Forest, which held a small manuscript titled \"Pogańskie gwary z Narewu\" (\"Pagan Speeches of Narew\"). It was written partly in Polish, and partly in an unknown, \"pagan\" language. Unfortunately, Zinov's parents threw away the book. However, before the manuscript was destroyed, Zinov had made notes of it which he sent to Vilnius University in 1983. Even though Zinov's notes were riddled with errors, it has been proven beyond doubt that the notes are indeed a copy of an authentic Yotvingian text. According to the first person who analyzed the manuscript, Zigmas Zinkevičius, this short Yotvingian–Polish dictionary (of just 215 words), \"Pogańskie gwary z Narewu\", appears to have been written by a Catholic priest in order to preach to locals in their mother tongue. Concerning the language, Zinkevičius put forth three possible versions: (1) a Yotvingian dialect under a heavy influence of Lithuanian (2) Lithuanian words over a strong Yotvingian substratum (3) the compiler of the dictionary could not tell Lithuanian from Yotvingian clearly, and may have included words from both. The latter version is indirectly supported by the name of the document: \"Speeches\", rather than \"Speech\" Some scholars did not rule out the possibility of forgery, but there are strong indications it was not.\n\n\n\n"}

The speakers are mainly to be found among the elderly, as school and preschool education tend to be negligent about fostering this linguistic tradition — nowadays, dialect use tends to be discouraged from an early age. Just like Lusatia and the Erzgebirge, the Vogtland is one of few areas in Saxony still having regions of comparatively self-contained dialect. There is a relation between Vogtländisch and Erzgebirgisch, including sharing some linguistic features, which originates in similarities and interdependencies in their respective settlement history.\n\nThe dialects of the Vogtland are anything but uniform. The sub-dialects that can be spotted in the various sub-regions sometimes differ drastically. In Plauen, for instance, a Vogtländisch is to be heard differing completely from that spoken in Klingenthal (vogtl. Klengedohl ) — a common remark between speakers from neighboring regions is \"die singe doch ihre Wördder\" (en.: they are singing [contrasted to articulately speaking] their words).\n\nThis is the main reason there is an extra differentiation to be made between the following sub-varieties:\n\n\"Do, wu de Hasn Hoosn haaßen un de Hosen Huusn haaßen, do bi iech dr ham.\"\n\nTranslated literally: \"There, where hares are called a pair of pants and a pair of pants are called \"Husen\", that's the place I call home.\"\nThis proverb is also quite common in neighboring Erzgebirge due to the shift of vowels described in it, which is also a feature of Erzgebirgsich.\n\nVogtländisch appears as a more than less fluent transition between Meißenisch in the area Chemnitz – Zwickau, Upper East Franconian in the area south to Hof, and South Eastern Thuringian in the area around Gera.\n\nPre-Vogtländisch is the name for the transitional area to Sächsisch, which surrounds Reichenbach. Here the originary \"singing\" of words is only audible rudimentally, which also holds true for the over-emphasis of intonation within a sentence. Following the Göltzsch upstream, these phenomena will increase strongly.\n\nAs in the upper and less densely populated areas of the Vogtland everyday Vogtländisch is more in use than in the other distributional areas of the variety, Upper Vogtländisch is commonly perceived to be highly (ab)original and representative for all Vogtländisch varieties. Upper Vogtländisch shows but few differences compared to Western Erzgebirgisch, while diachronic change within the distribution area of Erzgebirgisch seems to be currently occurring. Making a difference between Upper Vogtländisch and Western Erzgebirgisch seems impossible when not having detailed experience or data of their distinctive features.\n\nOne shared feature seems to be double negation:\n\nOn the mountain lies no snow not.\n\nAlso the delineation of Vogtländisch against Oberostfränkisch seems to be rather troublesome, if tried within small-scale regional comparisons. One tendency seems to be the absence of the \"rolled R\" in Vogtländisch, while distinctive exceptions may still occur.\n\nThe area surrounding Hof, also referred to as Bavarian Vogtland, is part of the transitional zone where many originally Vogtländisch features occur, while phonologically Oberostfränkisch seems to be closer.\n\nIn addition to Pre-Vogtländisch as a transitional form common features are recognizable on a geographically somewhat larger scale. In similarity to \"Sächsisch\", in Vogtländisch there are almost none but de-labialized vowel sounds and aspiration of consonants is almost completely absent. Especially recipients from southern and western Germany may perceive of the sound of Vogtländisch in a way encouraging the misconception, they would actually hear spoken \"Sächsisch\". Furthermore, \"ne\" instead of \"oder\" is used as a Question tag at the end of sentences, which is commonly perceived as a typicality of \"Sächsisch\" and Saxon use of High German.\n\nYet, big differences occur in Vogtländisch morphosyntax, giving it features that encourage it be ranked among the East Franconian dialects. Accordingly, many monosyllabic words of Vogtländisch are not intellibible for speakers of \"Sächsisch\", for instance \"aa\" or \"ae\" (en: \"also\", High German \"auch\" , \"Sächsisch\" \"ooch\" ) or the affirmation \"hoa\" or \"hae\" , which, while it can be used meaning \"yes\", does not have an equivalent in Standard English or High German, but corresponds with Sächsisch \"nu\" (in meaning roughly equivalent to \"aye\" in Scots).\n"}

It refers to positions on the extreme left and right sides of the pitch, or playing field (the \"wings\"). In American football and Canadian football, the analogous position is the wide receiver. Wingers often try to use pace to exploit extra space available on the flanks that can be made available by their teammates dominating the centre ground. They must be wary however of not crossing the touchline, or sidelines, and going out of play. In sports where the main method of scoring involves attacking a small goal (by whatever name) in the centre of the field, a common tactic is to cross the ball to a central teammate.\n\nIn football, a winger is an attacking midfielder in a wide position. Wingers are usually players of great pace or dribbling ability so as to provide cut-backs or crosses from which strikers can score. Their main function is to support attack from the wings. Wingers do lots of high-speed running from defence to attack.\n\nIn Australian rules football, the wingers or wingmen require considerable pace and stamina, as they run up and down the ground linking play between defence and attack and are normally highly skilled in kicking.\n\n\"Winger\", in ice hockey, is a forward position of a player whose primary zone of play on the ice is along the outer playing area. They typically work by flanking the centre forward. Originally the name was given to forward players who went up and down the sides of the rink. Nowadays, there are different types of wing men in the game—out-and-out goal scorers, checkers who disrupt the opponents and forwards who work along the boards and in the corners. This position is typically just called \"Wing\", often preceded by the side on which the player normally skates (Left Wing or Right Wing).\n\nIn Handball are two wing positions: left wing and right wing. In a typical team, these positions are occupied by fast and relatively small players. One of their main jobs in a game are fast attacks.\n\nWingers or wings play on either the extreme left or the extreme right. They are usually the fastest players on the field and score the most tries. Wingers often fall back with the fullback to take kicks from the opposition.\n\nThere are two wings in a rugby league team, numbered 2 and 5.. There are two wings in a rugby union team, numbered 11 and 14.\n\n"}
