He hailed from Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski near the town of Kielce. His father was Marcin Sadowski, who was a chamberlain at the Polish king's castle in Gostyń and, as a deputy of the Polish Sejm, an inspector of the king's land holdings in Ukraine. Though it is not known which schools Antoni attended in his youth, he did receive a classical education.\n\nDuring the Great Northern War in 1701, Sadowski was taken captive with his brother at Riga. He managed to escape captivity, and made his way to Scotland and England. He sailed to the British colonies, landing in New York City in 1704.\n\nAfter Sadowski moved to the colony of New York, he married Marya Bordt (anglicized as Mary Bird), daughter of Andrew Bird of Newtown, New York. They had six children together. Their eldest son Andrew Sadowski and three daughters, Justina, Anna, and Sofia, all married and had children. Two of their grandsons through son Andrew, James and Jacob Sadowski, became noted Kentucky pioneers. \n\nSadowski moved his family from New Jersey to Pennsylvania in 1712, to a property along the Schuylkill River. He, along with George Boone—grandfather of the noted frontiersman Daniel Boone—was a founder of Amity Township in Berks County in 1719.\n\nSadowski worked to establish friendly relations with the Native Americans in the area, learning the Delaware (Lenape) and Iroquois languages. He served as an interpreter to other settlers.\n\nHe became an Indian trader, traveling as far as Logstown (a village near the site of modern Ambridge, Pennsylvania). With two other Indian traders, he established a trading post at present-day Kittanning, Pennsylvania in June 1729. He became a citizen of Pennsylvania in 1735.\n\nSadowski died on April 22, 1736 in Amityville, Pennsylvania, and is buried in the cemetery of Old St. Gabriel's Episcopal Church in Douglassville.\n\nHis grave marker bears the following inscription:\nWhether or not he opened an Indian trading post on the shores of Lake Erie and gave his name to Sandusky, Ohio, here lies the greatest Polish frontiersman of colonial times, an organizer of Amity Township in 1719, and founder of the Sandusky family in America.

{"id": "6973884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6973884", "title": "Arbitration", "text": "Arbitration\n\nArbitration, a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR), is a way to resolve disputes outside the courts. The dispute will be decided by one or more persons (the \"arbitrators\", \"arbiters\" or \"arbitral tribunal\"), which renders the \"arbitration award\". An arbitration award is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts.\n\nArbitration is often used for the resolution of commercial disputes, particularly in the context of international commercial transactions. In certain countries such as the United States, arbitration is also frequently employed in consumer and employment matters, where arbitration may be mandated by the terms of employment or commercial contracts and may include a waiver of the right to bring a class action claim. Mandatory consumer and employment arbitration should be distinguished from consensual arbitration, particularly commercial arbitration.\n\nArbitration can be either voluntary or mandatory (although mandatory arbitration can only come from a statute or from a contract that one party imposes on the other, in which the parties agree to hold all existing or future disputes to arbitration, without necessarily knowing, specifically, what disputes will ever occur) and can be either binding or non-binding. Non-binding arbitration is similar to mediation in that a decision cannot be imposed on the parties. However, the principal distinction is that whereas a mediator will try to help the parties find a middle ground on which to compromise, the (non-binding) arbiter remains totally removed from the settlement process and will only give a determination of liability and, if appropriate, an indication of the quantum of damages payable. By one definition arbitration is binding and non-binding arbitration is therefore technically not arbitration.\n\nArbitration is a proceeding in which a dispute is resolved by an impartial adjudicator whose decision the parties to the dispute have agreed, or legislation has decreed, will be final and binding. There are limited rights of review and appeal of arbitration awards. Arbitration is not the same as: judicial proceedings (although in some jurisdictions, court proceedings are sometimes referred as arbitrations), alternative dispute resolution (ADR), expert determination, mediation (a form of settlement negotiation facilitated by a neutral third party).\n\nParties often seek to resolve disputes through arbitration because of a number of perceived potential advantages over judicial proceedings. Companies often require arbitration with their customers, but prefer the advantages of courts in disputes with competitors:\n\nSome of the disadvantages include:\n\nBy their nature, the subject matter of some disputes is not capable of arbitration. In general, two groups of legal procedures cannot be subjected to arbitration:\n\nArbitration agreements are generally divided into two types:\nThe former is the far more prevalent type of arbitration agreement. Sometimes, legal significance attaches to the type of arbitration agreement. For example, in certain Commonwealth countries (not including England and Wales), it is possible to provide that each party should bear their own costs in a conventional arbitration clause, but not in a submission agreement.\n\nIn keeping with the informality of the arbitration process, the law is generally keen to uphold the validity of arbitration clauses even when they lack the normal formal language associated with legal contracts. Clauses which have been upheld include:\n\nThe courts have also upheld clauses which specify resolution of disputes other than in accordance with a specific legal system. These include provision indicating:\n\nAgreements to refer disputes to arbitration generally have a special status in the eyes of the law. For example, in disputes on a contract, a common defence is to plead the contract is void and thus any claim based upon it fails. It follows that if a party successfully claims that a contract is void, then each clause contained within the contract, including the arbitration clause, would be void. However, in most countries, the courts have accepted that:\n\nArguably, either position is potentially unfair; if a person is made to sign a contract under duress, and the contract contains an arbitration clause highly favourable to the other party, the dispute may still referred to that arbitration tribunal. Conversely a court may be persuaded that the arbitration agreement itself is void having been signed under duress. However, most courts will be reluctant to interfere with the general rule which does allow for commercial expediency; any other solution (where one first had to go to court to decide whether one had to go to arbitration) would be self-defeating.\n\nNations regulate arbitration through a variety of laws. The main body of law applicable to arbitration is normally contained either in the national Private International Law Act (as is the case in Switzerland) or in a separate law on arbitration (as is the case in England and Jordan). In addition to this, a number of national procedural laws may also contain provisions relating to arbitration.\n\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) of 1925 established a public policy in favor of arbitration. For the first six decades of its existence, courts did not allow arbitration for \"federal statutory claims\" through a bright-line \"nonarbitrability\" doctrine, but in the 1980s the Supreme Court of the United States reversed and began to use the act to require arbitration if included in the contract for federal statutory claims. Although some legal scholars believe that it was originally intended to apply to federal courts only, courts now routinely require arbitration due to the FAA regardless of state statutes or public policy unconscionability determinations by state courts. In consumer law, standard form contracts often include mandatory predispute arbitration clauses which require consumer arbitration. Under these agreements the consumer may waive their right to a lawsuit and a class action. In 2011, one of these clauses was upheld in \"AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion\".\n\nSeveral arbitration organizations exist, including the American Arbitration Association and JAMS. The National Arbitration Forum also conducts arbitrations, but it no longer conducts consumer arbitrations pursuant to a consent decree entered into in 2009 because of evidence that it had been biased toward, and had incentives that favored, credit card companies over cardholders. The AAA was also asked to exit the business., but has not done so.\n\nThe United States and Great Britain were pioneers in the use of arbitration to resolve their differences. It was first used in the Jay Treaty of 1795, and played a major role in the Alabama Claims case of 1872 whereby major tensions regarding British support for the Confederacy during the American Civil War were resolved. At the First International Conference of American States in 1890, a plan for systematic arbitration was developed, but not accepted. The Hague Peace Conference of 1899, saw the major world powers agreed to a system of arbitration and the creation of a Permanent Court of Arbitration. President William Howard Taft was a major advocate. One important use came in the Newfoundland fisheries dispute between the United States and Britain in 1910. In 1911 the United States signed arbitration treaties with France and Britain.\n\nArbitration was widely discussed among diplomats and elites in the 1890-1914 era. The 1895 dispute between the United States and Britain over Venezuela was peacefully resolved through arbitration. Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. The Olney-Pauncefote Treaty of 1897 was a proposed treaty between the United States and Britain in 1897 that required arbitration of major disputes. The treaty was rejected by the U.S. Senate and never went into effect.\n\nAmerican Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan (1913–1915) worked energetically to promote international arbitration agreements, but his efforts were frustrated by the outbreak of World War I. Bryan negotiated 28 treaties that promised arbitration of disputes before war broke out between the signatory countries and the United States. He made several attempts to negotiate a treaty with Germany, but ultimately was never able to succeed. The agreements, known officially as \"Treaties for the Advancement of Peace,\" set up procedures for conciliation rather than for arbitration. Arbitration treaties were negotiated after the war, but attracted much less attention than the negotiation mechanism created by the League of Nations.\n\nBy far the most important international instrument on arbitration law is the 1958 New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, usually simply referred to as the \"New York Convention\". Virtually every significant commercial country is a signatory, and only a handful of countries are not parties to the New York Convention.\n\nSome other relevant international instruments are:\n\nIt is often easier to enforce arbitration awards in a foreign country than court judgments. Under the New York Convention 1958, an award issued in a contracting state can generally be freely enforced in any other contracting state, only subject to certain, limited defenses. Only foreign arbitration awards are enforced pursuant to the New York Convention. An arbitral decision is foreign where the award was made in a state other than the state of recognition or where foreign procedural law was used. In most cases, these disputes are settled with no public record of their existence as the loser complies voluntarily, although in 2014 UNCITRAL promulgated a rule for public disclosure of investor-state disputes.\n\nVirtually every significant commercial country in the world is a party to the Convention while relatively few countries have a comprehensive network for cross-border enforcement of judgments their courts. Additionally, the awards not limited to damages. Whereas typically only monetary judgments by national courts are enforceable in the cross-border context, it is theoretically possible (although unusual in practice) to obtain an enforceable order for specific performance in an arbitration proceeding under the New York Convention.\n\nArticle V of the New York Convention provides an exhaustive list of grounds on which enforcement can be challenged. These are generally narrowly construed to uphold the pro-enforcement bias of the Convention.\n\nCertain international conventions exist in relation to the enforcement of awards against states.\n\nThe arbitrators which determine the outcome of the dispute are called the arbitral tribunal. The composition of the arbitral tribunal can vary enormously, with either a sole arbitrator sitting, two or more arbitrators, with or without a chairman or umpire, and various other combinations. In most jurisdictions, an arbitrator enjoys immunity from liability for anything done or omitted whilst acting as arbitrator unless the arbitrator acts in bad faith.\n\nArbitrations are usually divided into two types: \"ad hoc\" arbitrations and administered arbitrations.\n\nIn \"ad hoc\" arbitrations, the arbitral tribunals are appointed by the parties or by an appointing authority chosen by the parties. After the tribunal has been formed, the appointing authority will normally have no other role and the arbitration will be managed by the tribunal.\n\nIn administered arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by a professional arbitration institution providing arbitration services, such as the LCIA in London, or the ICC in Paris, or the American Arbitration Association in the United States. Normally the arbitration institution also will be the appointing authority. Arbitration institutions tend to have their own rules and procedures, and may be more formal. They also tend to be more expensive, and, for procedural reasons, slower.\n\nThe duties of a tribunal will be determined by a combination of the provisions of the arbitration agreement and by the procedural laws which apply in the seat of the arbitration. The extent to which the laws of the seat of the arbitration permit \"party autonomy\" (the ability of the parties to set out their own procedures and regulations) determines the interplay between the two.\n\nHowever, in almost all countries the tribunal owes several non-derogable duties. These will normally be:\n\nAlthough arbitration awards are characteristically an award of damages against a party, in many jurisdictions tribunals have a range of remedies that can form a part of the award. These may include:\n\nGenerally speaking, by their nature, arbitration proceedings tend not to be subject to appeal, in the ordinary sense of the word. However, in most countries, the court maintains a supervisory role to set aside awards in extreme cases, such as fraud or in the case of some serious legal irregularity on the part of the tribunal. Only domestic arbitral awards are subject to set aside procedure.\n\nIn American arbitration law there exists a small but significant body of case law which deals with the power of the courts to intervene where the decision of an arbitrator is in fundamental disaccord with the applicable principles of law or the contract. However, this body of case law has been called into question by recent decisions of the Supreme Court.\n\nUnfortunately there is little agreement amongst the different American judgments and textbooks as to whether such a separate doctrine exists at all, or the circumstances in which it would apply. There does not appear to be any recorded judicial decision in which it has been applied. However, conceptually, to the extent it exists, the doctrine would be an important derogation from the general principle that awards are not subject to review by the courts.\n\nThe overall costs of arbitration can be estimated on the websites of international arbitration institutions, such as that of the ICC, the website of the SIAC and the website of the International Arbitration Attorney Network. The overall cost of administrative and arbitrator fees is, on average, less than 20% of the total cost of international arbitration.\n\nIn many legal systems - both common law and civil law - it is normal practice for the courts to award legal costs against a losing party, with the winner becoming entitled to recover an approximation of what it spent in pursuing its claim (or in defense of a claim). The United States is a notable exception to this rule, as except for certain extreme cases, a prevailing party in a US legal proceeding does not become entitled to recoup its legal fees from the losing party.\n\nLike the courts, arbitral tribunals generally have the same power to award costs in relation to the determination of the dispute. In international arbitration as well as domestic arbitrations governed by the laws of countries in which courts may award costs against a losing party, the arbitral tribunal will also determine the portion of the arbitrators' fees that the losing party is required to bear.\n\nAs methods of dispute resolution, arbitration procedure can be varied to suit the needs of the parties. Certain specific \"types\" of arbitration procedure have developed, particularly in North America.\n\n\nSuch forms of \"Last Offer Arbitration\" can also be combined with mediation to create MEDALOA hybrid processes (Mediation followed by Last Offer Arbitration).\n\nArbitration in its common law form developed in England; in the Middle Ages, tribunals such as the Courts of the Boroughs, of the Fair and of the Staple arose as the Royal Courts were not designed for trade disputes, and trade with foreigners was otherwise unenforceable. In the mid-16th century, common law courts developed contract law and the Admiralty court became accessible for disputes with foreign merchants, broadening the venues for trade disputes. Courts became suspicious of arbitration; for example, in \"Kill v. Hollister\" (1746), an English court ruled that the arbitration agreement could 'oust' courts of law and equity of jurisdiction. Merchants, however, retained provisions to settle disputes among themselves, but tension between the arbitration proceedings and courts eventually resulted in the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 which provided for the appointment of arbitrators and umpires, allowed courts to 'stay proceedings' when a disputant filed a suit despite an agreement to arbitrate, and provided a process for arbitrators to submit questions to a court. Later, the Arbitration Act 1889 was passed, followed by other Arbitration Acts in 1950, 1975, 1979 and 1996. Arbitration Act 1979 in particular limited judicial review for arbitration awards.\n\nArbitration was common in the early United States, with George Washington serving as an arbiter on an occasion. The United States had a notable difference from England, however, in that unlike England, its courts generally did not enforce executory agreements (binding predispute agreements) to arbitrate. This meant that prior to an award, a claimant could sue in court even if they had contractually agreed to settle disputes by arbitration. After the award, courts reviewed the judgment, but generally deferred to the arbitration, although the practice was not consistent.\n\nThe lack of enforcement of predispose agreements led to the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925, with New York leading with a state law enforcing predispose agreements. In 1921, the American Bar Association drafted the Federal Arbitration Act based on the New York law, which was passed in 1925 with minor changes. In the next decade, the American Arbitration Association promoted rules and facilitated arbitrations through appointments.\n\n\n\n"}

The term refers to the black bag of equipment that a burglar would carry or a black bag operation.\n\nAs with rubber-hose cryptanalysis, this is technically not a form of cryptanalysis; the term is used sardonically. However, given the free availability of very high strength cryptographic systems, this type of attack is a much more serious threat to most users than mathematical attacks because it is often much easier to attempt to circumvent cryptographic systems (e.g. steal the password) than to attack them directly.\n\nRegardless of the technique used, such methods are intended to capture highly sensitive information e.g. cryptographic keys, key-rings, passwords or unencrypted plaintext. The required information is usually copied without removing or destroying it, so capture often takes place without the victim realising it has occurred. \n\nIn addition to burglary, the covert means might include the installation of keystroke logging or trojan horse software or hardware installed on (or near to) target computers or ancillary devices. It is even possible to monitor the electromagnetic emissions of computer displays or keyboards from a distance of 20 metres (or more), and thereby decode what has been typed. This could be done by surveillance technicians, or via some form of bug concealed somewhere in the room. Although sophisticated technology is often used, black bag cryptanalysis can also be as simple as the process of copying a password which someone has unwisely written down on a piece of paper and left inside their desk drawer.\n\nThe case of \"United States v.

{"id": "31567468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31567468", "title": "Capacity theory", "text": "Capacity theory\n\n'Capacity theory is the theoretical approach that pulled researchers from Filter theories with Kahneman's published 1973 study, \"Attention and Effort\" (https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_hi_quality.pdf - bottom of page 7 of the book, page 14 of the pdf) positing attention was limited in overall capacity, that a person's ability to perform simultaneous tasks depends on how much \"capacity\" the jobs require. Further researchers - Johnson and Heinz (1978) and Navon & Gopher (1979) - went further with Kahneman's study.\n\nShalom Fisch used Kahneman's capacity theory, just as others did for their research, to published a paper on children's understanding of educational content on television. It is a communication theory based on model which is used to explain and predict how children learn from educational television programing. It is formed by combining cognitive psychology and limited capacity of working memory. Working memory is explained as having limited resources available for processing external information and when demands exceed capabilities, then the material will not be attended to.\nThe model attempts to explain how cognitive resources are allocated when individuals, particularly children, comprehend both the educational and the narrative content of an educational program\nCapacity theory suggests that when educational content is tangential to the narrative content the two information sources compete with one another for limited resources in working memory. However, when the distance between educational content and narrative content is small, the process complement one another rather than compete for resources, therefore an individual is likely comprehend more.\n\nThe capacity model consists of three basic components.\n\nCapacity model implies that television viewers will construct their understanding of the narrative content by accessing prior knowledge and draw inferences on the new material based on previous exposure. Theory and empirical research has supported the notion that people are using working memory to process information needed to follow the story line or plot. Due to the audio/visual nature of television, individual program factors will influence how much demand is used. For example, a fast paced action sequence will require more working memory to follow the action than perhaps a slow dialogue between two characters.\nThis is best understood by breaking it down to two types of characteristics, viewer characteristics and program characteristics.\n\n\nDevelopmental research in text comprehension has found that young children can use schemata to process stories only when they are structured simply and clearly state causal linkages\n\nThe processing of educational content has not received as much attention as processing of narrative content. Many of the guiding principles in this section were developed out of speculation and then verified through current studies. As with the narrative content, there are viewer and program characteristics that effect comprehension.\n\n\n\nDistance is the final component of this model. The idea of distance separates this model from other cognitive processing models such as Limited Capacity. Distance referrers to the degree to which the educational content is integrated into the narrative. This concept has been dubbed \"content on the plotline\" by the Children's Television Workshop. This is best described as the role the content has in the story of events. Distance is not binary, but is best described in length as small or large.\n\nUnderstanding the effect distance has on processing will explain how certain content competes for attention. Large distances will require more resources due to the increase in competition, however resources are limited. The process used to encode, store, and retrieve narrative content is the same as educational content. When the narrative and educational content are intertwined, then it is said to be a small distance, thus reducing the amount of competition for limited resources. The parallel process responsible for comprehending narrative and educational content complement one another, thus increasing information retention.\n- This model predicts that educational content will be better attended to when the distance from the narrative is small and has been shown in previous studies\n\nThere are several factors that will influence the processing of narrative and educational content.\n\nThis theory is governed by several broad principles detailing the allocation of resources among the two content types.\n\nThis principle suggests that priority is given to comprehension of the narrative content over the educational content assuming all things are equal. This primarily occurs when the distance between the educational content and narrative content is large. Working memory will be devoted to narrative before educational content. This is largely due to the fact that people typically select television content for its entertainment value before its educational value. Secondly, narrative content is featured as the primary or “surface” contents, whereas educational content is secondary or “deep” content.\n\nEach individual will have various levels of resource ability. As with any type of content the individual is exposed to, there will always be a competition for resources. Several factors can increase or decrease the demands required for processing, such as pacing, graphics, audio, and other production features. When high demands are required for processing the narrative content of educational programming, then less resources will be available for educational content. This demand to process both sources can be reduced if the educational content and narrative content are closely related.\n\nIndividuals will select media to achieve certain goals or objectives. As a result, an individual may choose to watch an educational program and consciously attempt to allocate more resources to the educational content rather than the narrative content. Studies have consistently shown that viewer’s reason for watching can affect at which level the narrative is recalled and understood. Further research using this model has revealed that the same has been shown to occur with educational content. It should be understood that this model does not assume that the attention paid to the educational content will cause the viewer to abandon resources to the narrative.\n\n</ref>Kellogg, R.

The most common is one's spoken language, but the term can also be used to refer to any narrative form: consider the color scheme of an image (e.g. red for danger), or the rules of a board game (e.g. the military signifiers in chess).\n\nFerdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) emphasised that signs only acquire meaning and value when they are interpreted in relation to each other. He believed that the relationship between the signifier and the signified was arbitrary. Hence, interpreting signs requires familiarity with the sets of conventions or codes currently in use to communicate meaning.\n\nRoman Jakobson (1896–1982) elaborated the idea that the production and interpretation of texts depends on the existence of codes or conventions for communication. Since the meaning of a sign depends on the code within which it is situated, codes provide a framework within which signs make sense (see Semiosis).\n\nTo that extent, codes represent a broad interpretative framework used by both addressers and their addressees to encode and decode the messages. Self-evidently, the most effective communications will result when both creator and interpreter use exactly the same code. Since signs may have many levels of meaning from the denotational to the connotational, the addresser's strategy is to select and combine the signs in ways that limit the range of possible meanings likely to be generated when the message is interpreted. This will be achieved by including metalingual contextual clues, e.g. the nature of the medium, the modality of the medium, the style, e.g. academic, literary, genre fiction, etc., and references to, or invocations of, other codes, e.g. a reader may initially interpret a set of signifiers as a literal representation, but clues may indicate a transformation into a metaphorical or allegorical interpretation diachronically. Distinctions of class or memberships of groups will be determined by the social identity each individual constructs through the way the language is spoken (i.e. with an accent or as a dialect) or written (i.e. in sentences or in SMS format), the place of residence (see Americanisms), the nature of any employment undertaken, the style of dress, and nonverbal behaviour (e.g. through differentiating customs as to the extent of private space, whether and where people may touch or stare at each other, etc.). The process of socialisation is learning to understand the prevailing codes and then deciding which to apply at any given time, i.e. acknowledging that there is sometimes an ideological quality to the coding system, determining levels of social acceptability, reflecting current attitudes and beliefs. This includes regulatory codes that are intended to control behaviour and the use of some signifying codes. The human body is a means of using presentational codes through facial expressions, gestures, and dress. So words spoken may change their connotation to unacceptable if accompanied by inappropriate nonverbal signs.\nThe other code forms rely upon knowledge held by, and the interests of, the addressees. Specialised denotational codes may provide a more objective and impersonal form of language for mathematical, philosophical, and scientific texts. Hence, for example, the ability to read this text depends upon a more specialised form of vocabulary and different skills to those required to read a genre text detailing the investigations of a detective or the adventures of a secret agent. There are also specialised connotational and ideological codes to reflect particular social, political, moral, and aesthetic values. Musical and iconic codes would be relevant as between a work by Arnold Schoenberg and a piece of bubblegum pop, and a painting by Rembrandt and a comic book by Frank Miller, etc. Each medium has its own specialised codes and, by making them more explicit, semiotics is attempting to explain the practices and conventions have appeared in each form and to understand how meaning is being communicated. In return, this assists addressers to improve their techniques, no matter what their functional needs, e.g. as politicians, journalists, advertisers, creative artists, etc. Indeed, awareness leads to an intentional blending of codes for effect, e.g. an advertiser may produce a more effective campaign with a slogan, images and a jingle using lexical, social gestural, and musical codes.\nIn communication research and media research, the way receivers act towards the message and the way it is encoded becomes relevant, and generates different reactions: \n\n\n"}

It was also used for the Naxi language, e.g. the 1932 Naxi Gospel of Mark., and used in the Zaiwa or Atsi language e.g. the 1938 Atsi Gospel of Mark.\n\nThe alphabet uses uppercase letters from the Latin script, and rotated versions thereof, to write consonants and vowels. Tones and nasalization are written with Roman punctuation marks, identical to those found on a typewriter. Like the Indic abugidas, the vowel is not written. However, unlike those scripts, the other vowels are written with full letters.\n\nThe Chinese government recognized the alphabet in 1992 as the official script for writing in Lisu.\n\nNote: You may need to download a Lisu capable Unicode font if not all characters display.\n\n\nFor example, is , while is .\n\nTones are written with standard punctuation. Lisu punctuation therefore differs from international norms: the comma is (hyphen period), and the full stop is (equal sign).\nThe tones , , , may be combined with and as compound tones. However, the only one still in common use is .\n\nThe apostrophe indicates nasalization. It is combined with tone marks.\n\nThe understrike (optionally a low macron) indicates the Lisu \"A glide\", a contraction of without an intervening glottal stop. The tone is not always falling, depending on the environment, but is written regardless.\n\nThe Fraser alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2009 with the release of version 5.2.\n\nAn additional character which is the inverted Y used in the Naxi language is not in Unicode.\n\nThe Unicode block for the Fraser alphabet, called Lisu, is U+A4D0–U+A4FF:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14238759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14238759", "title": "Germanic parent language", "text": "Germanic parent language\n\nIn historical linguistics, the Germanic parent language (GPL) includes the reconstructed languages in the Germanic group referred to as Pre-Germanic Indo-European (PreGmc), Early Proto-Germanic (EPGmc), and Late Proto-Germanic (LPGmc), spoken in the 2nd and 1st millennia BC.\n\nThe less precise term \"Germanic\", that appears in etymologies, dictionaries, etc., loosely refers to a language spoken in the 1st millennium AD, proposedly at that time developing into the group of Germanic languages—a stricter term for that same proposition, but with an alternative chronography, is \"Proto-Germanic language\".\nAs an identifiable neologism, \"Germanic parent language\" appears to have been first used by Frans Van Coetsem in 1994. It also makes appearances in the works of Elzbieta Adamczyk, Jonathan Slocum, and Winfred P. Lehmann.\n\nSeveral historical linguists have pointed towards the apparent material and social continuity connecting the cultures of the Nordic Bronze Age (1800 – 500 BC) and the pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe (500 BC – 1 AD) as having implications in regard to the stability and later development of the Germanic language group. The emerging consensus among scholars is that the First Germanic Sound Shift, long considered to be \"the\" defining mark in the development of Proto-Germanic, happened as late as 500 BC.\nResearch conducted over the past few decades displays a notable interest in exploring the linguistic and sociohistorical conditions under which this sound shift occurred, and often formulates theories and makes reconstructive efforts regarding the periods immediately preceding Proto-Germanic as traditionally characterised. \nThe notion of the Germanic parent language is thus used to encompass both the Pre-Proto-Germanic stage of development preceding the First Germanic Sound Shift (assumed to be contemporary with the Nordic Bronze Age) and that stage traditionally identified as Proto-Germanic up to the beginning of the Common Era.\n\nThe upper boundary assigned to the Germanic parent language is described as \"dialectal Indo-European\". In the works of both Van Coetsem and Voyles, attempts are made to reconstruct aspects of this stage of the language using a process the former refers to as \"inverted reconstruction\"; i.e. one using the data made available through the attested daughter languages in light of and at times in preference to the results of the \"comparative reconstruction\" undertaken to arrive at Proto-Indo-European. The results are not strictly standard in terms of traditional Proto-Indo-European reconstruction, but they are instead presented as characteristic of the incipient predecessor to Early Proto-Germanic, hence the terms Pre-Germanic Indo-European (Voyles) or Pre-Proto-Germanic (Van Coetsem) for this stage.\n\nThe lower boundary of the Germanic parent language has been tentatively identified as that point in the development of the language which preceded permanent fragmentation and which produced the Germanic daughter languages.\n\nIn his work entitled \"The Vocalism of the Germanic Parent Language\", Frans Van Coetsem lays out a broad set of phonological characteristics which he considers to be representative of the various stages encompassed by the Germanic parent language:\n\nKoivulehto (2002) further defines Pre-Germanic as \"[the] language stage that followed the depalatalization of IE palatals (e.g. IE \"ḱ\" > PreGmc \"k\") but preceded the Gmc sound shift \"Lautverschiebung\", \"Grimm's Law\", (e.g. \"k\" > PGmc \"χ\").\" Other rules thought to have affected the Pre-Germanic stage include Cowgill's Law, which describes the process of laryngeal loss known to have occurred in most post-PIE (IE) dialects, and Osthoff's law, which describes rules for the shortening of long vowels, known to have applied in western dialects such as Greek, Latin, and Celtic, but not in Tocharian or Indo-Iranian. Ringe (2006) suggests that it is likely that Osthoff's Law also applied to Germanic, and that the loss of laryngeals such as h must have preceded the application of Grimm's Law.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "258998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=258998", "title": "Jan Guillou", "text": "Jan Guillou\n\nJan Oskar Sverre Lucien Henri Guillou (, ; born 17 January 1944) is a French-Swedish author and journalist. Among his books are a series of spy fiction novels about a spy named Carl Hamilton, and a trilogy(+) of historical fiction novels about a Knight Templar, Arn Magnusson. He is the owner of one of the largest publishing companies in Sweden, Piratförlaget (\"Pirate Publishing\"), together with his wife, publisher Ann-Marie Skarp, and Liza Marklund.\n\nGuillou's fame in Sweden was established during his time as an investigative journalist. In 1973, he and co-reporter Peter Bratt exposed a secret intelligence organization in Sweden, \"Informationsbyrån\" (IB). He is still active within journalism as a column writer for the Swedish evening tabloid \"Aftonbladet\".\n\nIn October 2009, the tabloid \"Expressen\" accused Guillou of having been active as an agent of the Soviet spy organization KGB between 1967 and 1972. Guillou confirmed he had a series of contacts with KGB representatives during this period, he also confirms having received payments from KGB, but maintains that his purpose was to collect information for his journalistic work. The accusation was based on documents released from the Swedish Security Service (Säpo) and interviews with former KGB Colonel Oleg Gordievsky. In a later trial, \"Expressen\" denied having accused Guillou of having been a Soviet spy, claiming that this was a false interpretation of its headlines and reporting.\n\nGuillou was born in Södertälje, Stockholm County, Sweden. His Breton-Swedish father, Charles Guillou (born in 1922), came to Sweden as the son of the janitor at the French embassy in Stockholm. His mother, Marianne (née Botolfsen; 1922–2013), is of part-Norwegian descent. Guillou acquired French citizenship at birth and became a Swedish citizen in 1975. When Guillou's grandfather was offered a position at the French embassy in Helsinki, Finland, his father decided to move with him and settled there. Guillou grew up with his mother and her new husband in Saltsjöbaden and Näsbypark outside of Stockholm.\n\nHe studied at Vasa Real in Stockholm but was expelled from the school because of his bad behaviour; including physical abuse, theft and blackmail. He then went on to study for two years at the Solbacka boarding school in Södermanland. He finished his \"studentexamen\" (upper-secondary final examination) from the boarding school Viggbyholmsskolan, located in Viggbyholm, in 1964. Guillou has described his upbringing, with the continuous physical abuse from his sadistic stepfather and the harsh treatment at the Solbacka school, in the semi-autobiographical novel \"Ondskan\" (1981). According to the Swedish tabloid newspaper Expressen, his mother, his sister, his teachers and his friends from the Solbacka school have contested his account and called the book a hoax.\n\nGuillou was married first to the author and translator Marina Stagh, with whom he has two children, Dan (born 1970) and Ann-Linn (born 1972) Guillou. His daughter Ann-Linn, a journalist and feminist commentator, lives in a civil union with Sandra Andersson, daughter of film director Roy Andersson.\n\nHe is now married to publisher Ann-Marie Skarp. He has an apartment in the Östermalm district of Stockholm, where he has lived for most of his adult life. He also has a country residence in Flybo, Östhammar Municipality, northern Roslagen, where he lives when he writes his books.\n\nGuillou started his career as a journalist writing for the magazine \"FIB aktuellt\" from 1966 to 1967. He later co-founded the \"Folket i Bild/Kulturfront\" magazine, at which he worked from 1972 until 1977. He currently writes a column for Aftonbladet and also comments occasionally in other news outlets on current events usually taking the left-wing and the Anti-American side, particularly the conflicts in the Middle East and miscellaneous domestic issues, including the United States' War on Terrorism, Israeli policy towards the Palestinians, the Swedish Security Service, Swedish courtroom procedures and public inquiries.\n\nGuillou has served as the host of several television programmes: \"Magazinet\" (1981–1984), \"Rekordmagazinet\" (last years together with Göran Skytte) and \"Grabbarna på Fagerhult\" (together with Pär Lorentzon and Leif G. W. Persson), all shown on Sveriges Television.\n\nHe co-authored the crime/drama television series \"Talismanen\" (TV4, 2003). In the series, Guillou and co-author Henning Mankell both play the roles of themselves. Guillou also authored and narrated the history documentary series \"Arns rike\" (TV4, 2004) and \"Häxornas tid\" (TV4, 2005).\n\nIn 1973, \"Folket i Bild/Kulturfront\", a left-wing magazine, published a series of articles written by Guillou and Peter Bratt, revealing a Swedish secret intelligence agency called \"Informationsbyrån\" (\"The Information Bureau\" or \"IB\" for short). The articles, based on information initially furnished by former IB employee Håkan Isacson, described the IB as a secret organization that gathered information on Swedish communists and others deemed to be \"security risks\". The organization operated outside of the framework of the defense and ordinary intelligence, and was invisible in terms of state budget allocations. The articles in \"Folket i Bild/Kulturfront\" accused the IB staff of being engaged in alleged murder, break-ins, wiretapping against foreign embassies in Sweden and spying abroad.\n\nThe exposure of the IB in the magazine, which included headshots with names and social security numbers of some of the alleged staff published under the headline \"Spies\", led to a major domestic political scandal known as the \"IB affair\" (\"IB-affären\"). The activities ascribed to this secret outfit and its alleged ties to the Swedish Social Democratic Party were denied by Prime Minister Olof Palme, Defense Minister Sven Andersson and the chief of the Swedish defence forces, Stig Synnergren. However, later investigations by various journalists and by a public commissions, as well as autobiographies by the persons involved, have confirmed some of the activities described by Bratt and Guillou. In 2002, the public commission published a 3,000-page report where research about the IB-affair was included.\n\nGuillou, Peter Bratt and Håkan Isacson were all arrested, tried in camera and convicted of espionage. According to Bratt, the verdict required some stretching of established judicial practice on the part of the court since none of them were accused of having acted in collusion with a foreign power. After one appeal Guillou's sentence was lessened from one year to 10 months. Guillou and Bratt served part of their sentence in solitary cells. Guillou was kept first at Långholmen Prison in central Stockholm and later at Österåker Prison north of the capital.\n\nIn 1976, two employees of Sveriges Radio contacted Guillou at Folket i Bild/Kulturfront with a story of a colleague that had been recruited by a CIA officer in Stockholm. They had earlier been turned down by a major newspaper, and now asked the journalist that had exposed IB if he could publish the story. The three worked out a scenario where the CIA recruiter could be legally accused of espionage, and instructed the recruit to collect evidence thereof. Unbelievable enough, the CIA officer agreed to give his spy written instructions of what information to retrieve, so the informal counter-intelligence group had only to stockpile these, take photographs of the two spies meeting, and discuss how much they needed before the final exposure would be made.\n\nThe recruited spy was at a later meeting instructed to go to Angola with orders to get information about both military and political conditions. The legally experienced within the group advised their double agent not to agree, but he went anyway. Afterwards, the group assembled to write a false report about the conditions in the civil war-ridden country. Before the three could finalize the entire story for publishing, the spy went to Angola a second time, now with additional tasks on his instruction sheet.\n\nAfter the spy had returned to Sweden, Guillou in advance placed the article in a major newspaper and with a television news editor. He also contacted the Foreign Department in order to prevent official denials, and discuss the repercussions of the espionage exposure. The published article was a true 'scoop', and the CIA spy handler was ordered to leave Sweden together with a colleague. The spy himself, avoided prosecution thanks to the article's portrayal of him as a rather heroic journalist, exposing foreign illegal operations to the public. Afterwards, both he and Jan Guillou were interrogated by the Swedish Security Service, but for assumed political reasons, no criminal charges were made. This time, the system worked to the journalist's advantage.\n\nDuring a five-year period starting at 1967 Jan Guillou had a series of meetings with KGB representatives. In October 2009 the Swedish news tabloid \"Expressen\" told this story under the headline \"Guillou secret agent for Soviet Union\". The Swedish security service Säpo at the time knew of the contacts from Guillou's colleague Arne Lemberg, who suspected the activities could be illegal.\n\nAccording to Jan Guillou his intention was to expose the KGB espionage journalistically through a scoop based on the activities he was being exposed to and the discussions he had with his KGB contact Jevgenij Gergel. One of the journalists who wrote the articles later commented that he believed Guillou's explanation, \"I do not doubt one word of what he has said\".\n\nGuillou received payment from KGB for written reports on Swedish politics, and \"Expressen\" points to this fact when defending its choice to refer to Guillou as a secret agent. Former KGB Colonel and defector Sergey Tretyakov characterised Guillou as a \"classic agent\". \"Because he accepted money and, worst of all, signed receipts, there's no question about it. The handling of him could be a schoolbook example at the KGB school in Moscow\". Espionage prosecutor Tomas Lindstrand wrote to PON that \"Agent and spy are not synonymous ideas ... an agent does not have to commit acts of espionage. An agent can perform assignments for his handler without crossing the line to what is prosecutable.\"\n\nSäpo at the time was skeptical towards Lemberg's report and commented that it found nothing illegal in a newspaper man writing an article based on public information and delivering it to Jevgenij Gergel.\n\nThe public Ombudsman of the Swedish Press, Yrsa Stenius, later concluded that \"Expressen\"'s presentation of facts had been an example of irresponsible journalism. According to her, \"Expressen\" had not backed up its frontpage assertion, that \"Jan Guillou [was a] Secret Soviet Agent\", despite the fact that this had caused \"massive\" damage to Guillou's reputation. Stenius's conclusion caused controversy, and a number of newspaper leader writers demanded that she resign her post.\n\nOn 1 June 2010 The Swedish Press Council [PON] acquitted \"Expressen\" of wrongdoing. \"Expressen\" denies having claimed that Guillou was guilty of the crime of \"espionage\", and PON agrees. The frontpage and headline assertions (\"Guillou Secret Soviet Agent\", \"Confesses KGB mission\", \"Recruited by chief of espionage\") according to PON \"do not have well defined meanings\". PON was also satisfied that the factual details of the story were fully covered in the text of the articles which also included Guillou's own account of the events.\n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, Guillou was associated with the Maoist Clarté association. He was also a member of the Communist Party of Sweden (formerly known as the Communist League Marxists-Leninists), a minor Maoist party active mainly during the 1970s, for six months until he was expelled for refusing to pay the monthly member fee while he was living abroad. Today, he no longer considers himself a Communist or a Maoist, but describes himself as socialist with a position on the political spectrum \"to the left of the Left Party\" (a Swedish party formerly known as \"The Left Party, the Communists\").\n\nGuillou is known for his support of the Palestinian people, and he has over the years consistently criticized Israel. In 1976, he wrote, \"Zionism is in its foundation racist because the state of Israel is built upon an apartheid system, exactly like South Africa\". He has repeatedly taken the stance that Israel is an \"apartheid state\". In an article published in \"Svenska Dagbladet\" in 1977, Guillou wrote, \"I'm an optimist, I believe that Israel will cease to exist prior to Armageddon\".\n\nThe book \"Irak – det nya Arabien\" (\"Iraq – The New Arabia\"), written by Guillou and his then-wife Marina Stagh, was published in 1977. In the book, which deals with Iraq under the Baath Party before Saddam Hussein's presidency, it is argued that the \"European idea of Iraq as a particularly violent country\" is simply \"a blend of political propaganda and racist fantasies\" (p. 91). Guillou and Stagh did the research for the book in 1975 and they assert that, at this time, \"the Baath regime is clearly popular and among the most stable in the Arab World\" (pp. 168–169), the freedom of the press enjoyed in Iraq was more extensive than in most other countries in the world (p. 239) and it would come as no surprise to the authors if \"well before the year 2000, Iraq will have surpassed European countries in living standards\" (p. 174).\n\nThe conditions at the Abu Ghraib prison, which Guillou claims to have visited as the first Western journalist, are described as excellent and even \"better than Swedish prisons\" (pp. 249–250). The book was published two years before Saddam Hussein became President of Iraq in 1979. In his 2009 autobiography, \"Ordets makt och vanmakt\" (\"The Power and Powerlessness of the Word\"), Guillou states that quotes such as the ones cited could be considered true back then. He does however also write that Saddam Hussein, who at the time of publishing was the vice-president under President Ahmed Hassan Al Bakr, was the actual leader of Iraq.\n\nImmediately following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Guillou caused controversy when he walked out of the Göteborg Book Fair in the midst of the three minutes of silence observed throughout Europe to honour the victims of the attacks. In an article in \"Aftonbladet\", Guillou argued that the event was an act of hypocrisy, stating that \"the U.S. is the great mass murderer of our time. The wars against Vietnam and its nearby countries alone claimed four million lives. Without a minute of silence in Sweden\". He also criticised those who said that the attacks were \"an attack on us all\" by stating that the attacks were only \"an attack on U.S. imperialism\".\n\nHe labeled the media's reaction to the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot and the measures taken to avoid havoc at the airports unnecessary since the suspects had already been caught. He argued that the media coverage was sensationalist and driven by profit considerations, and that the British government used the occasion to give an impression of success in the War on Terrorism. Pointing out that no explosives had been found, he wrote in a column headlined \"Don't believe anything written about al-Qaida\" that the reactions had resulted in a victimization of the Muslim community.\n\nEver since the IB affair and the resulting prison sentence for espionage in 1973, Guillou has been a strong critic of the Swedish Security Service. According to Guillou, the Security Service has listed him as a terrorist, which has led to problems with security officials when visiting other countries.\n\nIn recent years, Guillou has repeatedly criticised some people and groups within the Swedish radical feminist movement. However, he rejects being called an \"antifeminist\".\n\nGuillou has also attracted controversy over his views on homosexuality. He has said that \"homosexuality is more of a vogue phenomenon than something you're born into. It's something that has come and gone through history\" and that \"homosexuality didn't exist in the 17th century\".\n\nGuillou's first book, \"Om kriget kommer\", was published in 1971.\n\nIn 1986 Guillou published a novel about the fictional Swedish military spy Carl Hamilton. Guillou's fictional hero was originally drafted and trained to become an attack diver, but was later chosen for special training in California to become a U.S. Navy SEAL. He has a leftist background and was dubbed Coq Rouge by one of his superiors while he was temporarily working for the security police forces (Säkerhetspolisen). The first \"Coq Rouge\" novel came to be followed by another eleven books.\n\nSeveral characters in the books are based on actual people. Jan Guillou himself is the basis of a character named Erik Ponti, which is also the name Guillou uses in the autobiographical novel \"Ondskan\" (literally: \"The Evil\").\n\n\nA partial draft of an eleventh novel, along with Guillou's account on why it could not be completed, was published as \"Hamlon\" in 1995. Guillou stated that \"En medborgare höjd över varje misstanke\" was the last book and in order to make sure that Hamilton would never return, Guillou \"banished\" him from Sweden through a life sentence. Since he only intended to write about Sweden, no other book would be possible. However, when he was working on \"Madame Terror\", he realised that he needed Hamilton to fill in a specific role. After Hamilton had been revived as a character, he made another major appearance in \"Men inte om det gäller din dotter\", where his life sentence was lifted. Guillou thereby cleared the way for new appearances by Hamilton in future books.\n\n\nAfter finishing the Coq Rouge series, Guillou wrote a trilogy about Arn Magnusson, a fictional Swedish character from the Middle Ages forced to become a Knight Templar. The series is an account of the life of Arn Magnusson, a fictional character who becomes a witness as well as a catalyst to many important historical events, both in his homeland of Sweden and in the crusades against the Middle East.\nThe trilogy, dubbed the \"Crusades trilogy\", consists of the following books:\n\nGuillou also wrote a follow-up novel about Birger Jarl, founder of Stockholm, entitled \"The Heritage of Arn\" (\"Arvet efter Arn\", 2001). In Guillou's fictional universe, Birger Jarl is the grandson of Arn Magnusson.\n\nGuillou has written an autobiographical book about his school years, \"Ondskan\" (1981), which also became a film, \"Evil\" (2003). The movie was nominated for an Academy Award in 2003. Guillou, still listed as a terrorist by the US government, was unable to attend. He managed to get a visa, but it was linked to attending the Academy Award ceremony, and director Mikael Håfström had already given Guillou's ticket to his own wife instead.\n\nThis series about humanity's greatest, cruelest and bloodiest century starts in 1900 with three boys from a poor fishing village in Norway, and follows them and, in later books, their children to Germany, England, Africa and Sweden. It touches on ambitious engineering projects, colonialism in Africa, communities of artists, the world wars, underground resistance, espionage, nuclear threat and Vietnam protests.\n\n\n\nGuillou was also chairman of the Swedish Publicists' Association (\"Publicistklubben\") from 2000 to 2004.\n\n"}

He was a major follower of the philosophy and methods of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nKalelkar was born in Satara on 1 December 1885. He was native of Kaleli village near Sawantwadi in Maharashtra which gave his surname Kalelkar. He matriculated in 1903 and completed B. A. in Philosophy from Fergusson College, Pune in 1907. He appeared in the first year examination of LL.B. and joined Ganesh Vidyalaya in Belgaum in 1908. He worked for a while on the editorial staff of a nationalistic Marathi daily named \"Rashtramat\", and then as a teacher at a school named Ganganath Vidyalaya in Baroda in 1910. Within a few years, the British government forcibly closed down the school because of its nationalistic spirit in 1912. He traveled to Himalaya on foot and later joined Acharya Kripalani in visit to Burma (Myanmar) in 1913. He met Mahatma Gandhi in 1915.\n\nInfluence by Gandhi, he became member of Sabarmati Ashram. He taught at Rashtriya Shala of Sabarmati Ashram. For some time, he served as the editor of \"Sarwodaya\" periodical which was run from the premises of the Ashram. With Gandhi's encouragement, he played an active role in establishing Gujarat Vidyapith at Ahmedabad, and became its vice-chancellor in 1928. He was imprisoned several times due to his participation in Indian independence movement. He retired from Gujarat Vidyapith in 1939.\n\nIn 1935, Kalelkar became member of \"Rashtabhasha Samiti\", a committee whose objective was to popularize Hindi-Hindustani language as the national language of India. He was active with Gandhi Smarak Nidhi from 1948 to his death.\n\nHe was appointed as a member of Rajya Sabha from 1952 to 1964 and later appointed as a president of Backward Classes Commission in 1953. He presided Gujarati Sahitya Parishad in 1959. He established Gandhi Vidyapith, Vedchhi in 1967 and served as its vice chancellor.\n\nHe died on 21 August 1981.\n\nMahatma Gandhi called him \"Savai Gujarati\", a quarter more than a Gujarati.\n\nHe then went on writing remarkable, voluminous travelogues in Gujarati, Marathi, and Hindi.\n\nThe following is a partial list of Kalelkar's books:\n\n\nKalelkar received a Sahitya Akademi Award in 1965 for his \"Jeevan-Vyavastha\", a collection of essays in Gujarati. He was honored with Sahitya Akademi Fellowship in 1971 for his literary achievements.\n\nThe Government of India conferred on him Padma Vibhushan (India's second-highest civilian award after the Bharat Ratna) in 1964. It also issued a commemorative stamp in his honor in 1985.\n\n"}

The term suggests that the woman to whom it is applied will ultimately adopt a strictly heterosexual identity.\n\nIn a 1999 article in the \"Seattle Weekly\", A. Davis related her experimentation with same-sex relationships, and how as a result, she experienced hostility from lesbian friends who pressured her to identify as a bisexual, including one friend who urged her to do so as a political statement, despite the fact that Davis identifies as a heterosexual who merely experimented with women for a brief period. Davis claimed that women who experienced same-sex relationships are more attuned to LGBT issues, and more likely to oppose discrimination. She also claimed that if the same attitudes were applied to men who experimented with homosexuality, it would promote greater acceptance of the LGBT community.\n\n\n"}

His grandfather Edward Logue, originally from Dublin, in 1856 founded Logue's Brewery, a predecessor of the South Australian Brewing Company. His parents were George Edward Logue, an accountant at his grandfather's brewery who later managed the Burnside Hotel and Elephant and Castle Hotel, and Lavinia Rankin. Although not a Catholic himself, he was reportedly related to Michael Logue, who was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nHe attended Prince Alfred College between 1889 and 1896. Unable to decide what to study, Logue came across Longfellow's \"The Song of Hiawatha\":\nWhat inspired Logue was the rhythm and he decided to put his interest in voices to good use. After leaving school at sixteen, he received elocution training from Edward Reeves. Reeves had moved to Adelaide in 1878 and taught elocution to his pupils by day and gave popular recitals to audiences in Victoria Hall by night. Logue worked for Reeves as a secretary and assistant teacher from 1902, while studying music at the University of Adelaide's Elder Conservatorium. While working for Reeves, Logue began to give recitals of his own for which he was praised for his \"clear, powerful voice.\"\n\nAfter his father died on 17 November 1902, Logue set up his own practice as a teacher of elocution. By 1904, he had gained a good reputation and was receiving praise from the local newspapers. However, he decided to take a contract with an engineering firm some westward in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, installing an electricity supply at a gold mine.\n\nHis professional career began in Perth, where, in addition to teaching elocution, acting, and public speaking, he put on plays and recitations, and also founded a club for public speakers. He was also involved with Perth's Young Men's Christian Association and schools such as Methodist Ladies' College, Loreto Convent, Scotch College, Perth Technical School, and Claremont Teachers College.\n\nIn 1911, Logue and his wife set out on a tour of the world to study methods of public speaking. Later he developed treatments for Australian First World War war veterans who had shell shockinduced impaired speech. In addition to physical exercises, which helped with patients' breathing, Logue's distinctive therapy emphasised humour, patience, and \"superhuman sympathy\".\n\nIn 1924, Logue took his wife and three sons to England, ostensibly for a holiday. Once there, he \ntook jobs teaching elocution at schools around London, and in 1926 he opened a speech-defect practice at 146 Harley Street. Logue used fees paid by wealthy clients to subsidise patients unable to pay. It was here that the Duke of Yorkthe future King George VIsought Logue's help. Logue became a founding fellow of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists in 1944.\n\nBefore ascending the throne as George VI, the Duke of York dreaded public speaking because of a severe stammer; his closing speech at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925 proved an ordeal for speaker and listeners alike. Resolved to find some way to manage his stammer, the Duke engaged Logue in 1926 after being introduced to Logue by Lord Stamfordham.\n\nDiagnosing poor co-ordination between the Duke's larynx and thoracic diaphragm, Logue prescribed a daily hour of vocal exercises. Logue's treatment gave the Duke the confidence to relax and avoid tension-induced muscle spasms. As a result, he suffered only the occasional hesitancy in speech. By 1927, he was speaking confidently and managed his address at the opening of the Old Parliament House in Canberra without stammering.\n\nLogue worked with the Duke through the 1930s and 40s. He used tongue-twisters to help his patient rehearse for major speeches, his coronation as King and his radio broadcasts to the British Empire throughout the Second World War. The two men remained friends until the King's death.\n\nIn 1944, King George VI appointed Logue a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO), elevating him from Member of the Order (MVO), which was conferred upon Logue at the time of George VI's Coronation.\n\nKing George VI died on 6 February 1952. On 26 February 1952, Logue wrote to the late king's consort, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, stating that since 1926 the king:\n\nThe Queen Mother replied two days later: \nLogue married Myrtle Gruenert, a 21-year-old clerk, at St George's Anglican Cathedral, Perth, on 20 March 1907. They had three sons, Valentine, Laurie, and Anthony—Valentine trained at King's College London and St George's Hospital and went on to become one of the most distinguished neurosurgeons of his generation.\n\nLionel Logue was a Freemason, initiated, passed, and raised in 1908, and became Worshipful Master in 1919; he was a member of St. George's Lodge (now J.D. Stevenson St. George's Lodge No.6, Western Australian Constitution).\n\nHe lived in a 25-room Victorian villa called Beechgrove in Sydenham from before 1933 until about 1940.\n\nMyrtle died in June 1945 and Logue died, in London, on 12 April 1953. His funeral was held 17 April in Holy Trinity, Brompton before his body was cremated. Representatives of Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother attended the funeral.\n\nWith Peter Conradi, Logue's grandson Mark wrote a book, \"\", about his grandfather's relationship with the king. The short title was used for the 2010 British film \"The King's Speech\", a historical drama written by David Seidler, in which Logue was played by Geoffrey Rush and his patient by Colin Firth. In February 2011, \"The King's Speech\" won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Firth. Rush was nominated for an Academy Award and won a 2010 BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of Logue in the film.\n\nIn the West End stage adaptation of \"The King's Speech\" at Wyndham's Theatre, Australian actor Jonathan Hyde played Lionel Logue.\n\nWelsh actor Michael Elwyn played Logue in the 2002 television film \"Bertie and Elizabeth\".\n\nDerek Lawson portrayed Logue in the 2015 comedy \"A Royal Night Out\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is traditionally associated with La Cosa Nostra, the Italian organized crime group dominant in Sicily for their use of it in vendettas, defence —such as its use against Mussolini's army when he decided to break up the Sicilian mafioso network—and hunting.\n\nThe shortened barrel (or barrels) of a lupara lend themselves to easier handling in wooded areas, or to easier concealment and indoor employment in urban areas. The absence of choke and the shortened barrel contribute to a wider spread of shot than that of a choked full length gun.\n\nThe word \"lupara\" means literally \"for the wolf\", reflecting its traditional use in wolf hunting. The word achieved wider recognition through Mario Puzo's bestselling novel \"The Godfather\" in which the lupara is used extensively by the mafia in Sicily, including Michael Corleone's bodyguards. \n\nFrom the word \"lupara\" comes the Italian expression \"lupara bianca\" (white lupara), a term especially used by journalists to refer to a mafia-style slaying in which the victim's body is deliberately hidden.\n\nAn early example of criminal use of the weapon in the United States was the assassination of the New Orleans chief of police, David Hennessy, in October 1890. After Chief Hennessy was shot in an ambush, four luparas were found at the murder scene. The murder punctuated a rivalry between gangs of Sicilian fruit company stevedores whose contracts did not fall under the auspices of the local longshoreman's union. A pile of sawn-off shotguns was displayed after the murder, including a homemade gun with a folding iron stock, and another with a hook on its stock to brace against the arm when firing one armed. Anti-Italian provocation, following the failed prosecution of a group of suspected men, resulted in a mob assault on the New Orleans Parish Prison and the subsequent lynching of many Italian prisoners.\n\nLuparas figure prominently in \"The Godfather\"; in the movie, they are carried by Michael Corleone's bodyguards Calo (Franco Citti) and Fabrizio (Angelo Infanti).\n\n"}

He lost his mother when he was one and half years old. He was engaged, when four years old, to three years old girl Parvatikunwar. He completed elementary education of local 'village school' in Gopipura, Surat known as Pranshankar Mehtaji's school. Later he joined Government English school. During his school days, he was influenced by his teachers and reformers Durgaram Mehta and Dadoba Pandurang, brother of Atmaram Pandurang who founded Prarthana Samaj. He also attended weekly meetings of Manav Dharma Sabha run by them.\n\nLater he joined his alma mater as an associated teacher in 1851. In 1852, he joined Highschool department of Elphinstone Institute, Bombay and was appointed as an assistant teacher in 1854. He was closely associated with reformist organisations; Gyan Prasarak Sabha and Buddhivardhak Sabha in Bombay. He was later appointed as an acting headmaster at the Ahmedabad High School in 1857 and later made a deputy education inspector there. In 1859, he was appointed as a member of school textbooks committee, the textbooks known by T. C.

Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923), was a U.S. Supreme Court case that held that a 1919 Nebraska law restricting foreign-language education violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nWorld War I witnessed an extensive campaign against all things German, such as the performance of German music at symphony concerts and the meetings of German-American civic associations. Language was a principal focus of legislation at the state and local level. It took many forms, from requiring associations to have charters written in English to a ban on the use of German within the town limits. Some states banned foreign language instruction, while a few banned only German. Some extended their bans into private instruction and even to religious education. A bill to create a Department of Education at the federal level was introduced in October 1918, designed to restrict federal funds to states that enforced English-only education. An internal battle over conducting services and religious instruction in German divided the Lutheran churches.\n\nOn April 9, 1919, Nebraska enacted a statute called \"An act relating to the teaching of foreign languages in the state of Nebraska,\" commonly known as the Siman Act. It imposed restrictions on both the use of a foreign language as a medium of instruction and on foreign languages as a subject of study. With respect to the use of a foreign language while teaching, it provided that \"No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language other than the English language.\" With respect to foreign-language education, it prohibited instruction of children who had yet to successfully complete the eighth grade.\n\nOn May 25, 1920, Robert T. Meyer, while an instructor in Zion Parochial School, a one-room schoolhouse in Hampton, Nebraska, taught the subject of reading in the German language to 10-year-old Raymond Parpart, a fourth-grader. The Hamilton County Attorney entered the classroom and discovered Parpart reading from the Bible in German. He charged Meyer with violating the Siman Act.\n\nMeyer was tried and convicted in the district court for Hamilton County, was and fined $25 USD (about $ in dollars). The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed his conviction by a vote of 4 to 2. The majority thought the law a proper response to \"the baneful effects\" of allowing immigrants to educate their children in their mother tongue, with results \"inimical to our own safety.\" The dissent called the Siman Act the work of \"crowd psychology.\"\n\nMeyer appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. His lead attorney was Arthur Mullen, an Irish Catholic and a prominent Democrat, who had earlier failed in his attempt to obtain an injunction against enforcement of the Siman Act from the Nebraska State Supreme Court. Oral arguments expressed conflicting interpretations of the World War I experience. Mullen attributed the law to \"hatred, national bigotry and racial prejudice engendered by the World War.\" Opposing counsel countered that \"it is the ambition of the State to have its entire population 100 per cent. American.\"\n\nIn his decision, Justice McReynolds stated that the \"liberty\" protected by the Due Process clause \"[w]ithout doubt...denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\"\n\nAnalyzing in that context the liberty of the teacher and of parents with respect to their children, McReynolds wrote: \"Practically, education of the young is only possible in schools conducted by especially qualified persons who devote themselves thereto. The calling always has been regarded as useful and honorable, essential, indeed, to the public welfare. Mere knowledge of the German language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful. Heretofore it has been commonly looked upon as helpful and desirable. Plaintiff in error taught this language in school as part of his occupation. His right thus to teach and the right of parents to engage him so to instruct their children, we think, are within the liberty of the amendment.\" And further: \"Evidently the Legislature has attempted materially to interfere with the calling of modern language teachers, with the opportunities of pupils to acquire knowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education of their own.\"\n\nAnd finally: \"That the state may do much, go very far, indeed, in order to improve the quality of its citizens, physically, mentally and morally, is clear; but the individual has certain fundamental rights which must be respected. The protection of the Constitution extends to all, to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue. Perhaps it would be highly advantageous if all had ready understanding of our ordinary speech, but this cannot be coerced by methods which conflict with the Constitution​—​a desirable end cannot be promoted by prohibited means.\"\n\nHe allowed that wartime circumstances might justify a different understanding, but that Nebraska had not demonstrated sufficient need \"in time of peace and domestic tranquility\" to justify \"the consequent infringement of rights long freely enjoyed.\"\n\nJustices Oliver Wendell Holmes and George Sutherland dissented. Their dissenting opinion, written by Holmes, is found in the companion case of \"Bartels v. State of Iowa\". Holmes wrote that he differed with the majority \"with hesitation and unwillingness\" because he thought the law did not impose an undue restriction on the liberty of the teacher since it was not arbitrary, was limited in its application to the teaching of children, and the State had areas where many children might hear only a language other than English spoken at home. \"I think I appreciate the objection to the law, but it appears to me to present a question upon which men reasonably might differ and therefore I am unable to say the Constitution of the United States prevents the experiment being tried.\"\n\n\"Meyer\", along with \"Pierce v. Society of Sisters\" (1925), is often cited as one of the first instances in which the U.S. Supreme Court engaged in substantive due process in the area of civil liberties. Laurence Tribe has called them \"the two sturdiest pillars of the substantive due process temple\". He noted that the decisions in these cases did not describe specific acts as constitutionally protected but a broader area of liberty: \"[they] described what they were protecting from the standardizing hand of the state in language that spoke of the family as a center of value-formation and value-transmission...the authority of parents to make basic choices\" and not just controlling the subjects one's child is taught. Substantive due process has since been used as the basis for many far-reaching decisions of the Court, including \"Roe v. Wade\", \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\", and \"Lawrence v. Texas\". Justice Kennedy speculated in 2000 that both of those cases might have been written differently nowadays: \"\"Pierce\" and \"Meyer\", had they been decided in recent times, may well have been grounded upon First Amendment principles protecting freedom of speech, belief, and religion.\"\n\n"}

After working as a village development officer and as an editor with a weekly newspaper, he joined the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali, a theatre company, where he worked as a playwright for decades. He wrote more than fifty plays on social, mythological and historical subjects including commercially or critically successful plays like \"Rajbeej\" (1891), \"Ajabkumari\" (1899, 1912), \"Saubhagyasundari\" (1901), \"Nandbatrisi\" (1906) and \"Krishnacharitra\" (1906).\n\nHe was born on 1 November 1867 in Chavand (now in Amreli district, Gujarat, India) to the religious Prashnora Nagar Brahmin family of Harinand Dayanad and Mankunwar. He was a descendant of Mula Bhatt who had served as a minister of Nawanagar State before 10 or 12 generations. He studied until the fourth standard in English medium and had read religious works and Sanskrit books at his home, later going on to study with a Sanskrit scholar for some time.\n\nMulani started a job as a village development officer in Dhari, for a salary of ten rupees, but subsequently left to go to Bombay (now Mumbai). After a period of struggles, he joined a weekly \"Satyavakta\" as a proofreader for a salary of twenty rupees. He covered true stories in his column, Ghanghata and became popular. Later he served as an editor of the weekly.\n\nHe met Prabhurai Popatlal, who offered him a job as a play editor in the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali, a theatre company, for a salary of five rupees. Eventually, he left the \"Satyavakta\" and his salary rose to thirty rupees. His first play \"Shakuntal\" (1889) and his second play \"Rajbeej\" (1891) starring Bapulal Nayak were performed in the Geity Theatre and were commercially successful. It was followed by \"Kundbala\" (1892) and \"Mansinh Abhaysinh\" (1893). \"Kundbala\" depicted a relationship between a princely state and the British Raj. Following it, the censorship by the British authorities was instituted. His health deteriorated and he returned to his native village where he wrote his successful plays, \"Mularaj Solanki\" (1895) and \"Karanghelo\" (1896, based on Nandshankar Mehta's \"Karanghelo\"). His salary rose to 35 rupees. After studying Shakespeare and Kalidasa, he wrote \"Barrister\" (1897), which was a play about a youth who was devastated due to his attraction to the western world. It became successful and his salary rose to 75 rupees. Later he was made a partner in the company.\n\nMulani introduced tragedy to the Gujarati theatre. His \"Jayraj\" (1898) and \"Ajabkumari\" (1899) were not initially successful, due to the occurrence of plague in Bombay. They however, became hits when they were performed again in 1912–13. \"Ajabkumari\" was praised by scholars like Govardhanram Tripathi but the audience did not like it. Although the financial condition of the company had deteriorated, his \"Vikramcharitra\" (1900), based on Shamal Bhatt's \"Sinhasan Batrisi\", became a commercial hit and helped the company recover. He demanded his pending sum of 28,000 rupees with the company, but received only 10,000 rupees. Feeling hurt, he left the company. His contract terms, however, prohibited him from writing plays for other companies for another ten years. He subsequently founded the Kathiyawadi Natak Mandali in 1906 in the name of his son-in-law, Vishwanath Madhavji Bhatt. Viththaldas Bhojak and Bapulal Punjiram Nayak were its director and musician respectively.\n\nHe rejoined Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali when Nathuram Shukla requested him to rewrite \"Saubhagyasundari\", which had failed to impress the owners and the director of the company. He rewrote the play and it premiered on 19 October 1901. Starring Bapulal Nayak and Jaishankar Bhojak in lead roles as well as Mohanlala in the role of Madhav, the play became a major success and Jaishankar became known for his female impersonator role of Sundari. The pairing of Bapulal Nayak and Jaishankar Sundari became popular with the audience and they starred together in many plays later on. Prabhashankar 'Ramani' acted in his several plays and rose to fame. \"Jugal Jugari\" (1902) was his social play.\n\nKathiyawadi Natak Mandali produced his \"Krishnacharitra\" (1906) which brought Krishna, for the first time, on the Gujarati stage. Devotional in nature, it was based on stories from the \"Bhagavata\", depicting the relationship between Krishna and Gopi. His plays influenced Urdu as well as Marathi plays. He had written \"Veermandal\" in just a day. In addition, he had written scripts for films. In debt in 1909, he sold Kathiyawadi Natak Mandali, and in 1915, he left the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali. His \"Ek Ja Bhool\" (1919), written for Royal Natak Mandali, had a discussion on a drone in its script. In 1920s, he worked with Aryasubodh Gujarati Natak Mandali.\n\nAfter retirement, he lived in Kanpur and Bhavnagar. He died on 14 December 1957.\n\nMulani was active in old Gujarati theatre. He had written more than fifty plays on social, mythological and historical subjects; about twenty eight staged, four not staged and fourteen adapted plays. His popular plays include \"Rajbeej\" (1891), \"Ajabkumari\" (1899, 1912), \"Saubhagyasundari\" (1901), \"Nandbatrisi\" (1906) and \"Krishnacharitra (1906)\". \"Krishnacharitra\" and \"Devkanya\" are published as books.

It is sometimes used for vague data transformation steps that are not yet clear to the speaker. Common munging operations include removing punctuation or html tags, data parsing, filtering, and transformation.\n\nThe term was coined in 1958 in the Tech Model Railroad Club at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1960 the backronym \"Mash Until No Good\" was created to describe Mung, and a while after it was revised to \"Mung Until No Good\", making it one of the first recursive acronyms. It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language TECO.\n\nIt differs from the very similar term munge, because munging usually implies destruction of data, while mungeing usually implies modifying data in order to create protection related to that data.\n\nMunging may also describe the constructive operation of tying together systems and interfaces that were not specifically designed to interoperate. Munging can also describe the processing or filtering of raw data into another form.\n\nAs the \"no good\" part of the acronym implies, munging often involves irrevocable destruction of data. Hence in the early text-adventure game \"Zork\", also known as \"Dungeon\", the user could mung an object and thereby destroy it (making it impossible to finish the game if the object was an important item).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "568649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=568649", "title": "Non-heterosexual", "text": "Non-heterosexual\n\nNon-heterosexual is a sexual orientation or sexual identity that is not heterosexual. The term helps define the \"concept of what is the norm and how a particular group is different from that norm\". \"Non-heterosexual\" is used in feminist and gender studies fields as well as general academic literature to help differentiate between sexual identities chosen, prescribed and simply assumed, with varying understanding of implications of those sexual identities.<ref name=\"Butch/femme: Inside\"></ref> The term is similar to \"queer\", though less politically charged and more clinical; \"queer\" generally refers to being non-normative and non-heterosexual. Some view the term as being contentious and pejorative as it \"labels people against the perceived norm of heterosexuality,\nthus reinforcing heteronormativity\". Still others note \"non-heterosexual\" is the only term useful to maintaining coherence in research and suggest it \"highlights a shortcoming in our language around sexual identity\"; for instance, its use can enable bisexual erasure.\n\nMany gay, lesbian and bisexual people were born into cultures and religions that stigmatized, repressed or negatively judged any sexuality that differed from a heterosexual identity and orientation. Additionally the majority of heterosexuals still view non-heterosexual acts as taboo and non-conventional sexual desires are generally hidden entirely or masked in various ways. \"Non-heterosexual\" is more fully inclusive of people who not only identify as other than heterosexual but also as other than gay, lesbian and bisexual. Some common examples include \"same gender loving\", \"men who have sex with men (MSM)\", \"women who have sex with women\" (WSW), \"bi-curious\" and \"questioning\". \"Non-heterosexual\" is considered a better general term than \"homosexual\", \"lesbian and gay\", \"LGBT\" or \"queer\" for being more neutral and without the baggage or gender discrimination that comes with many of the alternatives. For instance, until 1973, the American Psychological Association listed \"homosexual\" as a mental illness, and it still has negative connotations.\n\n\"Non-heterosexual\" is found predominantly in research and scholarly environments possibly as a means to avoid terms deemed politically incorrect like \"lesbian\", \"dyke\", \"gay\", \"bisexual\", etc. that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people use as self descriptors. When used by those who don't identify as LGB or when used by LGB people disparagingly, the terms are generally considered pejorative, so \"non-heterosexual\" is a default and innocuous term unlikely to offend readers. For example, the Kinsey scale can be divided between those exclusively heterosexual and everyone else. The term has come into more prominence in the academic field starting in the 1980s and more prominently in the 1990s with major studies of identities of non-heterosexual youth and a smaller number of studies specifically looking at non-heterosexual college students. \"Non-heterosexual\" is also used to encompass transgender and intersex people, because although these are gender identities rather than sexual identities, they are within the LGBT and queer umbrella communities. Additionally, \"non-heterosexual\" encompasses a wide variety of terms used by different cultures whose own terms might never neatly translate to a homosexual or bisexual identity; for researching and extrapolating data it is a practical and accepted term.\n\nIn a 2004 book that integrates \"the academic disciplines of cinema studies, sociology, cultural and critical studies\" regarding the Big Brother phenomena, \"non-heterosexual\" was used as a universal term to help compare information from over thirty countries. In exploring and studying the emerging field of gay, lesbian and bisexual seniors, \"non-heterosexual\" is a default term to demonstrate that the \"vast majority\" of literature assumes that older people are heterosexual and makes \"no effort\" to explore the experiences and attitudes of those who are not. In \"Welfare and the State\" the authors describe the perceived advantages of lesbians in the workplace as they, in theory, wouldn't have children so would be advantageous to the labor force. The authors point out, however, that not only do many lesbians have children but they routinely identify as heterosexual through much of their lives or at least until their children are old enough that a non-heterosexual identity would not greatly impact their families negatively.\n\n\"Non-heterosexual\" is also used when studying lesbian and gay families and family structures. It came into wider use in this context when the AIDS pandemic's impact on gay male communities was being explored as many gay men created families out of extended networks of friends and these became their support systems.\n\nThe use of the term ‘non-heterosexual’ to refer to LGBTQ people as a blanket term could perpetuate heterosexuality as the norm. It implies that any identity that cannot be defined as ‘hetero’ is abnormal. The term means the opposite of heterosexual, thus implying a deviance from the social norm. Historically the term was used to force people into one of two distinct identities; the “normalization of a sex that was ‘hetero' proclaimed a new heterosexual separatism — an erotic apartheid that forcefully segregated the sex normals from the sex perverts.” The heterosexual-homosexual binary that is implied by using the term ‘non-heterosexual’ as a variation of ‘homosexual’ is often interpreted as a stand in for ‘the opposite of heterosexual’ rather than a description of various identities. This ignores those who identify as bisexual, pansexual, queer, etc. The term ‘heterosexual’ is a relatively new term that was created to separate the majority from the Other, and the continued use of ‘non-heterosexual’ as an umbrella term for those in the LGBTQ community perpetuates the notion of the normal versus the Other. Non-heterosexual is also rather problematically used as a catch-all term, encompassing gender identity as well as sexual identity. The term ‘non-heterosexuality’ continues the erasure of bisexuality from discussions around sexuality and identity because of its roots in the heterosexual-homosexual binary. Sexuality and gender are different concepts and by labelling the entire LGBT+ community as being within the category of non-heterosexual it prioritizes certain groups as the term is sexuality specific. This encompassment of identities leads to the erasure of differing gender identities in the conversations around ‘non-heterosexual’ communities.\n\nBy referring to LGBTQ people as non-heterosexual, it enforces the idea of “compulsory heterosexuality” and that anyone who does not fit into that category is going against the norm. “As Patrick Hopkins has argued, heterosexism and homophobia are founded on and sustained by binary gender categories, specifically the assumption that there are distinct and proper masculine and feminine gender roles and identities against which deviation is measured.” The use of the term non-heterosexual indicates a departure from what is acceptable in society while highlighting the juxtaposition between the ideal heterosexual and unideal non-heterosexual. “Heterosexism is about dominance, and the practices that support it are often replicated, reinforced, and reflected by the attitudes, behaviors, and practices of even [the] best-intentioned allies.” Presenting heterosexuality as the norm frames ‘non-heterosexuality’ as the abnormal. Heterosexuality as a categorization and as a term, was not created until the late nineteenth century, prior to this relations between the sexes were not believed to be overtly sexual. In the Victorian era sex was seen as an act between “manly men and womanly women, [as] procreators, not specifically as erotic beings or heterosexuals.” The division between the heterosexual and the non-heterosexual came in the 1860s after the “growth of the consumer economy also fostered a new pleasure ethic,” the erotic became a commodity to be bought and sold. At the same time the ”rise in power and prestige of medical doctors allowed those upwardly mobile professionals to prescribe a healthy new sexuality.” Men and women were now meant to enjoy sex. Relations between those of the ‘opposite sexes’ was seen as healthy and encouraged by medical professionals. This creation and celebration of the ‘Normal Sexual’ ultimately resulted in its counterpart: the ‘Sexual Pervert,’ anyone who fell outside the heterosexual ideal. “In its earliest version, the twentieth-century heterosexual imperative usually continued to associate heterosexuality with a supposed human ‘need,’ ‘drive,’ or ‘instinct’ for propagation, a procreant urge linked inexorably with carnal lust… giving praise to vent to heteroerotic emotions was thus praised as enhancing baby-making capacity, marital intimacy and family stability.” The basic oppositeness of the sexes was seen as the basis for normal, healthy sexual attraction. The term heterosexuality was created as a way to subjugate and other anyone who did not confirm to mainstream ideals of sexuality. It was a term that created a sense of validation that heterosexuality was the normal, healthy version of human sexuality. The use of non-heterosexual today continues this history of othering people based on a belief that anyone who is not heterosexual is inherently abnormal.\n\nAlthough “non-heterosexuality” is considered a blanket term for all LGBTQ identities, it is often interpreted as another word for homosexual which contributes to the continuation of systematic bisexual erasure. Bisexuality has a long history of being overshadowed and ignored in favour of the belief in monosexuality, it “[represents] a blind spot in sex research.” The term non-heterosexual suggests a division between heterosexual and homosexual, the heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy, rather than the heterosexual-homosexual continuum, which accounts for identities that are not exclusively heterosexual or homosexual. By separating identities into either/or, bisexual identities are left in a place of ambiguity, “bisexuals transgress boundaries of sexually identified communities and thus are always both inside and outside a diversity of conflicting communities.” The implied homosexual-heterosexual dichotomy that the term puts in place negates its use as a truly inclusive term; “[the] categories are constructed in such a way as to allow everyone access to one and only one, and to insist that anyone who is not already neatly situated in one category or the other had best be on the way to one.” This focus on either/or logic, heterosexuality or non-heterosexuality, where non-heterosexuality is closely associated with homosexuality rather than general queerness, slights those that the term attempts to describe; “where bisexuality does rate a mention, it is almost always rendered an epistemological and incidental by-product, aftereffect, or definitional outcome of the opposition of hetero/homosexuality.” \n\nNon-heterosexuality is often used to describe those in the LGBT+ community with non-cisgender identities. This is seen as problematic as sexual orientation and gender identity are different. However the distinction between the two is relatively modern. Historically “[transgender people] were classified as homosexuals by everyone, including the physicians who specialized in their treatment, and it is only in the past fifty years or so that transgender has been theorized as different in kind from homosexuality.” Many people still fail to understand or make the distinction between gender minorities and sexual minorities. The term itself is sexuality specific as it contains the word “sexual” with no mention of “gender.” Much in the way the term non-heterosexuality erases sexual minorities through its implied notion of the hetero/homosexual binary, it also ignores gender minorities. While trans people and people with non-binary gender identities are part of the LGBTQ community, having been subjected to many of the same injustices, labelling trans and genderqueer identities under the term non-heterosexual blurs the important differences between sexual orientation and gender identity. Not all trans people would identify their sexuality as being non-heterosexual, many trans people are attracted to the ‘opposite’ sex and therefore identify as heterosexual. Additionally “those with non-binary gender identities are likely to place [themselves] in a position in which heterosexuality is nonsensical, due to there being no “opposite” gender to their identities” While a non-binary person is less likely to identify as heterosexual, the assumption that as someone with a ‘non-heterosexual’ identity, they must be homosexual is also problematic as it ignores sexual orientations that are not dictated by the gender of the person but rather who they are (or are not) attracted to such as bisexual, pansexual, queer, androsexual, gynesexual, skoliosexual, or asexual.\n\nQueer people “are often expected to account for [their] sexual identifications by either proving [their] normality (that is, [they] are inside the sphere of heteronormativity), or by accepting that [their] difference from the heterosexual norm constitutes some form of essence.” The term non-heterosexual is used to highlight the absolute difference between heterosexual and queer identities. The language needs to change to describe LGBTQ people as autonomous beings “rather than considering [them] solely as sexual beings constituted within a heterosexual logic of sameness or difference.” The implied binary that the term non-heterosexual perpetuates erases those whose identities fall in the spectrum between heterosexuality and homosexuality. The hetero/homosexual dichotomy continues the systematic erasure of bisexual identities by emphasizing an assumed oppositeness with nothing allowed in between. Although non-heterosexual is meant to encompass the entire LGBTQ community it has a continued use outside the community as another word for homosexual. It emphasizes sexual orientation over gender identity because the term itself is sexuality specific although it is used for identities that are unrelated to sexuality. The interpretation of the term continues a history of gender identity being overlooked in discourse surrounding the LGBTQ community in favour of prioritizing sexual orientation. It ignores those who identify as non-binary, as the term non-heterosexuality has been interpreted as categorizing those who are sexually attracted to people of the ‘same sex’ as opposed to those who are attracted to those of the ‘opposite sex.’ Because if the broad spectrum encompassed by the term, general use favours sexual orientations that are defined by their reliance of the gender binary such as gay or lesbian rather than promoting orientations that are not dictated by the gender of the person identifying their sexuality. Non-heterosexual also implies that one can not be part of the LGBT+ community and identify as heterosexual as it ignores the differences between sexual orientation and gender identity. The term “non-heterosexual” is too broad yet at the same time it is routinely interpreted as pertaining to a minority category of people within the intended group of identities. Because it is so non-specific it is open to interpretation by those outside the LGBTQ community or by those who are not as educated about the spectrum of sexual orientations and gender identities leading to a greater emphasis on the identities that are already well known and an erasure of the identities that are already not a large part of mainstream dialogues.\n\n"}

{"id": "1586235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1586235", "title": "Onomasiology", "text": "Onomasiology\n\nOnomasiology (from (onomāzο)—to name, which in turn is from ὄνομα—name) is a branch of linguistics concerned with the question \"how do you express X?\" It is in fact most commonly understood as a branch of lexicology, the study of words (although some apply the term also to grammar and conversation). \n\nOnomasiology, as a part of lexicology, starts from a concept which is taken to be prior\n(i.e. an idea, an object, a quality, an activity etc.) and asks for its names. The opposite approach is known as semasiology: here one starts with a word and asks what it means, or what concepts the word refers to. Thus, an onomasiological question is, e.g., \"what are the names for long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried?\" (answers: \"french fries\" in the US, \"chips\" in the UK, etc.), while a semasiological question is, e.g., \"what is the meaning of the term \"chips\"?\" (answers: 'long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried' in the UK, 'slim slices of potatoes deep fried or baked until crisp' in the US).\n\nOnomasiology can be carried out synchronically or diachronically, i.e. historically.\n\nOnomasiology was initiated in the late 19th century, but it didn't receive its name until 1902, when the Austrian linguist Adolf Zauner published his study on the body-part terminology in Romance languages. And it was in Romance linguistics that the most important onomasiological works were written. Early linguists were basically interested in the etymology (i.e. the word-history) of the various expressions for a concept which was mostly a clearly defined, unchangeable concrete object or action. Later the Austrian linguists Rudolf Meringer and Hugo Schuchardt started the \"Wörter und Sachen\" movement, which emphasized that every study of a word needed to include the study of the object it denotes. It was also Schuchardt who underlined that the etymologist/onomasiologist, when tracing back the history of a word, needs to respect both the \"dame phonétique\" (prove the regularity of sound changes or explain irregularities) and the \"dame sémantique\" (justify semantic changes).\n\nAnother branch that developed from onomasiology and, at the same time, enriched it in turn was linguistic geography (areal linguistics), since it provided onomasiologists with valuable linguistic atlases. The first ones are \"Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reiches\" of Georg Wenker and Ferdinand Wrede, published beginning in 1888, the ALF (\"Atlas Linguistique de la France\") by Jules Gilliéron (1902–1920), the AIS (\"Sprach- und Sachatlas Italiens und der Südschweiz\") by Karl Jaberg and Jakob Jud (1928–1940), the DSA (\"Deutscher Sprachatlas\") by Ferdinand Wrede et al. (1927–1956). These atlases include maps that show the corresponding names for a concept in different regions as they were gathered in interviews with dialect speakers (mostly old rural males) by means of a questionnaire. Concerning English linguistics, onomasiology as well as linguistic geography has been playing only a minor role (the first linguistic atlas for the US was initiated by Hans Kurath, the first one for the UK by Eugen Dieth).\n\nIn 1931 the German linguist Jost Trier introduced a new method in his book \"Der deutsche Wortschatz im Sinnbezirk des Verstandes\" which is known as the lexical field theory. According to Trier, lexical changes must always be seen, apart from the traditional aspects, in connection with the changes within a given word-field. After World War II few studies on onomasiological theory have been carried out (e.g. by Cecil H. Brown, Stanley R. Witkowski, Brent Berlin). But onomasiology has recently seen new light with the works of Dirk Geeraerts, Andreas Blank, Peter Koch and the periodical \"Onomasiology Online\", which is published at the Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt by Joachim Grzega, Alfred Bammesberger and Marion Schöner. A recent representative of synchronic onomasiology (with a focus on word-formation processes) is Pavol Stekauer.\n\nThe most important instruments for the historical onomasiologist are:\n\nWhen a speaker has to name something, they first try to categorize it. If the speaker can classify the referent as member of a familiar concept, they will carry out some sort of cognitive-linguistic cost-benefit-analysis: what should I say to get what I want. Based on this analysis, the speaker can then either fall back on an already existing word or decide to coin a new designation. These processes are sometimes more conscious, sometimes less conscious.\n\nThe coinage of a new designation can be incited by various forces (cf. Grzega 2004):\n\nThe following alleged motives found in many works have been claimed (with corresponding argumentation) to be invalid by Grzega (2004): decrease in salience, reading errors, laziness, excessive phonetic shortness, difficult sound combinations, unclear stress patterns, cacophony.\n\nIn the case of intentional, conscious innovation, speakers have to pass several levels of a word-finding or name-giving process: (1) analysis of the specific features of the concept, (2) onomasiological level (where the semantic components for the naming units are selected [\"naming in a more abstract sense\"]), (3) the onomatological level (where the concrete morphemes are selected [\"naming in a more concrete sense\"]). The level of feature analysis (and possibly the onomasiological level) can be spared if the speaker simply borrows a word from a foreign language or variety; it is also spared if the speaker simply takes the word s/he originally fell back to and just shortens it.\n\nIf the speaker does not shorten an already existing word for the concept, but coins a new one, s/he can select from several types of processes. These coinages may be based on a model from the speaker's own idiom, on a model from a foreign idiom, or, in the case of root creations, on no model at all. In sum, we get the following catalog of formal processes of word-coining (cf. Koch 2002):\n\n\nThe name-giving process is completed with (4) the actual phonetic realization on the morphonological level.\n\nIn order to create a new word, the speaker first selects one or two physically and psychologically salient aspects. The search for the motivations (iconemes) is based on one or several cognitive-associative relations. These relations are:\n\nThese relations can be seen between forms, between concepts and between form and concept. \n\nA complete catalog reads the following associative relations (cf. also Koch 2002):\n\n\nThe concrete associations can or cannot be incited by a model which may be of speaker's own idiom or a foreign idiom.\n\n\n\n"}

Used only when the results are notably better than chance.\n\nA psi \"miss\" is specifically used to refer to instances where the subject has failed to achieve the result through psi, rather than where they have a non-significant negative score gained through random guessing.\n\nIn 1942, Gertrude Schmeidler, a professor of psychology at City University of New York, used a questionnaire to discover the beliefs of test subjects concerning psi. She called those who thought psi existed \"sheep,\" and those who did not think psi existed (or did not believe it could influence the tests) she called \"goats.\" When she compared the results of the questionnaire to the results of the psi test, she found that the \"sheep\" scored significantly above chance, and the \"goats\" scored significantly below chance. Schmeidler's results have since been confirmed by many other researchers. In 1992, a meta-analysis of 73 experiments by 37 different researchers confirmed that subjects who believe psi is real average higher results than those who do not believe in it. According to Mario Varvoglis, Ph.D., President of the Parapsychological Association from 2001 to 2002:\nSkeptics are justified in stating that those who believe firmly in psi will tend to see its occurrence everywhere, even to the point of confusing their own interpretations with the actual events. On the other hand, disbelievers will also tend toward the complementary fallacy, always finding some so-called \"rational\" explanation for a psi experience, even when it happens to them. But the sheep-goat effect suggests that the differences run deeper than mere interpretation: one's attitudes toward psi affects the likelihood that such phenomena will occur in the first place. The more an individual harbors a reductionistic view of the world, the less chance such phenomena will emerge (let alone be witnessed by them); the more one is interested in interconnectedness, and open to psi experiences, the more likely the world will \"respond\" by creating such experiences.\n"}

The Q'anjob'alan branch includes not only Q'anjob'al itself but also Chuj, Akatek, and Jakaltek, also spoken in Guatemala. The Q'anjob'alan languages are noted for being among the most conservative of the Mayan language family, although they do include some interesting innovations.\n\nQ'anjob'al consists of 26 consonant sounds and 5 vowel sounds. The letters of the alphabet are as follows: \n\na, b', ch, ch', d, e, h, i, j, k, k', l, m, n, o, p, q, q', r, s, t, t', tx, tx', tz, tz', u, w, x, xh, y, and ' (glottal stop).\n\nThe codice_1 in ch', k', q', t', tx', and tz' represents an ejective or glottalic egressive, i.e., the consonant is accompanied by a puff of air from the glottis. The letter \"r\" in Q'anjob'al has a limited distribution. It is used mostly in borrowings, primarily in words borrowed from Spanish, such as \"roxax\", rose, from Spanish 'rosa'. It is also used in affect and positional words like \"k'arari\" 'noise of an old engine or the like', \"jeran\" 'to be in a broken position/form'. The letters \"tx\" and \"x\" represent retroflex consonants, pronounced with the tongue curled backward in the mouth. It is believed such retroflection in Q'anjob'al is an influence from the Mamean Mayan languages.\n\nPrimary stress in Q'anjob'al is fairly simple. Words \"in isolation and in final phrase boundaries bear stress on the last syllable\". However, \"words within a phrasal unit (not in final phrase boundary) bear stress on their first syllable\".\n\nAs in all Mayan languages, Q'anjob'al classifies all verbs as either inherently \"intransitive\" (calling up only one argument) or as inherently \"transitive\" (calling up two arguments). Q'anjob'al is an ergative–absolutive language, in which the subject of a transitive verb takes an ergative affix, while the subject of an intransitive verb, as well as the object of a transitive verb, takes an absolutive affix. Ergative affixes are also used for possession. There are two sets of affixes for ergative: the first set is used for those verbal roots beginning with a consonant, and the second set is used for those beginning with a vowel. However, there is only one set of absolutive affixes with two variations: pronounced like free words or attached to something else.\n\nBelow is the table of ergative prefixes for verbal roots beginning with a consonant:\n\nErgative prefixes for verbal roots beginning with a vowel:\n\nAbsolutive affixes when attached to preceding sounds:\n\nAbsolutive affixes not attached to a preceding sound (they take an \"h\"):\n\nNote that the third person absolutive affix is 0, i.e., unmarked or empty.\n\nExamples:\n\ntransitive (ergative)\n\n\"X-0-inmaq' naq winaq\". (Mateo 2008: p.c.)\nCOMP-A3S-E1S-hit CL:masc man \n'I hit the man.'\n\nintransitive (absolutive)\n\"X-in way-i\". (Mateo 2008: p.c.) \nCOMP-A1S sleep-STAT \n'I slept.'\n\npossessive (ergative)\n\nbefore vowel:\n\"w-aqan\"\nE1S-foot\n'my foot'\n\nbefore consonant:\n\"s-q'ab\"'\nE3S-hand\n'his/her hand'\n\nHowever, while verbs are classified as either ergative or absolutive and take their own respective sets of pronoun affixes, this rule is altered in certain cases, such as when a verb becomes progressive:\n\n\"Ch-in kuy-w-i\".\nINC-A1S study-SFX-STAT\n'I study'.\n\nbut,\n\n\"Ipan hin-kuy-w-i\".\nPROG E1S-study-SFX-STAT\n'I am studying'.\n\nIn Q'anjob'al, aspect (whether an action has been completed or not) is more important than tense. Thus, in most utterances, one will indicate whether the action is incompletive, or whether it is completed, or may happen in the future, in which case it is considered 'unreal', or of irrealis mood, the event still only in the realm of thought or imagination.\n\n\"incompletive\"\n\"Ch(i)\" is used to indicate that an event is incomplete or ongoing at some time:\n\n\"Chi-0 toj naq unin b'ay y-atut-al kuy-oj\".\nINC-A3S go CL:masc child to E3S-house-ABS study-NZR\n'The boy goes to school'.\n\nCompletive\n\"Max\" or \"x-\" (both forms are used in free variation) are used to indicate that an event is complete:\n\n\"Max-ex mulnaj-i\".\nCOM-A2P work-STAT\n'You (pl.) worked.'\n\n\"X-0 way-i\".\nCOM-A3S sleep-STAT\n'He/she slept.'\n\nFuture/Irrealis\nThe prefix \"hoq-\" with the suffix \"-oq\" are used to indicate that the event spoken of has not yet happened, but remains only in the realm of the 'unreal' with only the potential for occurrence in the future:\n\n\"Hoq-0 saqch-oq heb\"'.\nIRR-A3 play-IRR A3P\n'They will play.'\n\nNegative\nNegative particles include \"k'am\" and \"manaq\":\n\n\"K'am chi-0 y-oche-j\".\nNEG INC-A3S E3S-want-SFX\n'He/she doesn't want it.'\n\n\"Manaq ix chi-0 toj kuy-oj\".\nNEG she INC-A3S go study-NOM\n'It is not she who goes to study.'\n\nInterrogative\nQuestions can be formed simply by using rising intonation with declarative syntax:\n\n\"Ch-0-oche-j cha-ch kanal-w-i w-etoq\"?\nINC-A3S-E2S-SFX INC-A2S dance-SFX-STAT E1S-with\n'Do you want to dance with me?'\n\nThere is also a question particle, \"mi\":\n\n\"Watx' mi ha-kul\"?\ngood INTER E2S-stomach\n'Is your stomach good?' \n\nAffixation\nMany different affixes are used in Q'anjob'al, both prefixes and suffixes. Among these are aj-, used to denote the doer or leader of an action: \"ajtz'ib\", 'writer' (< \"tz'ib\"', 'write'), \"ajb'e\", 'spiritual guide' (< \"b'e\", 'road'); \"-b'al\", used to indicate the location where something happens: \"tzomb'al,\" 'market' (< \"tzon\", 'buy'); \"-al\", \"-alil\", \"-il\", used to derive abstract nouns from adjectives, adverbs, numerals, transitive verb roots, and nouns: \"syalixhal\", 'his/her smallness' (< \"yalixh\", 'small'); \"swinaqil\", 'husband' (< \"winaq\", 'man'); \"-k'ulal\", to derive nouns from intransitive verbs, adjectives, other nouns, etc.: \"watxk'ulal\", 'friendliness'; \"-oj\", nominalizer, turning verbs into nouns: \"kuyoj\", 'studying' (< \"kuy\", 'study').\n\nQ'anjob'al has a fixed word order. It follows a verb–subject–object (VSO) word order. All changes to this word order are driven by pragmatic or syntactic factors like focus, negation, interrogation, relativization, etc. These are subject to an ergative–absolutive pattern where arguments cross-referenced by ergative affixes must become absolutives prior to their fronting (focus, negation, etc.). This results in some possible subject–verb (SV), object–verb–subject (OVS) orders. However SVO, SOV and OSV are not possible (or, at least, not attested in any known corpus). The apparent exception is in reflexives and reflexive possessives, where the reflexive phrase ERG-b'a (noun) or reflexive possessive ERG-noun appears directly following the verb.\n\nSome Q’anjob’al nouns require that certain classifiers be used with them. Among these are \"no\"' (animals), \"te\" (trees/wood), \"ix\" (female), \"naq\" (male), \"ch'en\" (stone/metal), \"xim\" (corn), and \"an\" (plants).\n\n\"no’ chej\"\nCL-animal horse\n'the horse'\n\n\"te’ na\"\nCL-wood house\n'the house'\n\n\"ix unin\"\nCL-fem child (girl)\n'the girl'\n\n\"naq unin\"\nCL-masc child (boy)\n'the boy'\n\n\"ch’en tumin\"\nCL-metal money\n'the money'\n\n\"an kaq\"\nCL-plant flower\n'the flower'\n\nReduplication, or duplication of a root word, is a minor process in the formation of Q'anjob'al vocabulary, as in the following:\n\n\"tx'itam\"\n'pig' \n\n\"pux-pux\"\n'belly of animal'\n\n\"tx'a-tx'a\"\n'chewing gum'\n\nQ'anjob'al consists of groups of roots that can take affixes. Words are traditionally classified as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, intransitive and transitive verbs, particles, and positionals. Positionals are a group of roots which cannot function as words on their own; in combination with affixes they are used to describe relationships of position and location. Particles are words that do not take affixes; they mostly function in adverbial roles, and include such things as interrogative particles, affirmative/negative words, markers of time and location, conjunctions, prepositions and demonstratives.\n\nLocatives are often formed by placing a noun after a possessed body-part term: \"s-ti b'e\", 'edge of the road' < 'its-mouth road' and \"s-jolom witz\", 'mountaintop' or 'summit' < 'its-head mountain'. Similarly, compound nouns may be formed by placing a noun after another possessed noun: \"y-atutal kuyoj\", 'school' < 'its-house studying'.\n\n\n\n\"anima\", person\n\"ch'enej\", rock/stone\n\"a' ej\", water/river\n\"ix\", woman\n\"chikay\", grandmother\n\"mamin\", grandfather\n\"ixim\", corn\n\"kaq\", red\n\"k'u\", sun/day\n\"mam\", father\n\"mis\", cat\n\"na\", house (also \"atut\")\n\"patej\", tortilla\n\"sat kan\", sky (\"lit\". snake's eye)\n\"son\", marimba\n\"te\"', tree\n\"tx'i\"', dog\n\"tx'otx'ej\", land\n\"tx'utx\"', mother\n\"unin\", child\n\"waykan\", star\n\"winaq\", man\n\"witz\", mountain\n\"xajaw\", moon/month\n\"yib'an q'inal\", Earth/world\n\"xumak\",flower\n\nA1S absolutive first person singular\nA1P absolutive first person plural\nABS abstractivizer\nCL classifier\nCOM complete\nE1S ergative first person singular\nE1P ergative first person plural\nINC incomplete\nINT interrogative\nIRR irrealis\nNEG negative\nNZR nominalizer\nPL plural\nPROG progressive\nSFX suffix\nSTAT status\n\n\n<br> \n"}
{"id": "7671062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7671062", "title": "Real estate owned", "text": "Real estate owned\n\nReal estate owned or REO is a term used in the United States to describe a class of property owned by a lender—typically a bank, government agency, or government loan insurer—after an unsuccessful sale at a foreclosure auction. A foreclosing beneficiary will typically set the opening bid at a foreclosure auction for at least the outstanding loan amount. If there are no bidders that are interested, then the beneficiary will legally repossess the property. This is commonly the case when the amount owed on the home is higher than the current market value of this foreclosure property, such as with a high loan-to-value mortgage following a real estate bubble. As soon as the beneficiary repossesses the property it is listed on their books as REO and categorized as an asset. (See \"non-performing asset\").\n\nThe term \"\" originates from the term \"other real estate owned\" (OREO), which is used on financial statements to classify real estate property owned by a financial institution but which is not directly related to its business. These financial institutions are often the lender. Lenders are primarily in the business of making loans with the intent that nearly all of those loans will be repaid in full with interest. Seizing, managing and reselling real property collateral to recover unpaid loan balances is secondary to lenders' primary line of business. Property management companies, for whom real estate management \"is\" their primary business, use the term OREO. \n\nIn balance sheet terms, OREO assets are considered non-earning assets for purposes of regulatory accounting. In the context of national banks in the U.S., the term OREO is legally defined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in regulations promulgated pursuant to , specifically in and .\n\nAs soon as a property goes into a distressed status (the borrower/home owner misses mortgage payments) the beneficiary will want to determine the amount of equity that the property has. A popular method to determine the equity is to obtain a Broker's Price Opinion (BPO) or order an appraisal. Based on the amount of equity that is determined from the BPO, the bank will decide whether to allow a short sale (if requested by the homeowner). If no short sale is requested by the home owner, the beneficiary will continue the foreclosure process. If the beneficiary is unable to sell the property through a short sale or at a foreclosure auction it will now become an REO property. \n\nAfter a repossession from which the property becomes classified as REO, the beneficiary will go through the process of trying to sell the property on its own or obtain the service of an REO Asset Manager. The beneficiary will remove the liens and other debts on the home and try to resell it to the public, either through future auctions, direct marketing through a real estate broker, or by itself. The asset manager may also try to contact REO realtors that specialize in certain ZIP codes to help sell this bank owned property. Real estate investors will often purchase these properties because of discounts offered to compensate for the condition of the property.\n\nMany larger banks and government institutions have REO/asset management departments that field bids and offers, oversee up keep, and handle sales. Some REO properties on the open market will be listed in MLS by the broker who performed the BPO. \n\nBank REO properties are generally in poor condition and need repairs and maintenance, both to satisfy property upkeep laws and to preserve and prepare the property for sale. Maintenance is generally the responsibility of the mortgage servicer and is often in turn provided by a specialized property preservation company. These \"property preservation services\" include: securing a property (changing locks, boarding up), debris removal, property maintenance (winterizing, cutting grass, repairing or tarping roof leaks), and rehabilitation.\n\nIn addition to preventing damage to the property, securing a property is used to prevent or discourage re-entry by former occupants or by squatters, which can both damage the property and require legal proceedings to remove, further complicating a sale. Swimming pools must also be secured to prevent deaths or injuries from drowning and falls.\n\nLenders may purchase \"real estate owned\" insurance to protect against loss and liability relating to lender-owned properties. REO insurance differs from \"forced placed\" insurance (also \"lender placed\" insurance), which a lender purchases for borrower-owned property when the borrower does not insure the property.\n\nBulk REO or bulk real estate owned, from a real estate investor’s point of view, is like investing on wholesale real estate properties. On the other hand, banks or lenders sell or open their assets in group for auction at a very low price compared to their market value. \n"}

{"id": "1723040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1723040", "title": "Retail loss prevention", "text": "Retail loss prevention\n\nRetail loss prevention is a set of practices employed by retail companies to preserve profit. Profit preservation is any business activity specifically designed to reduce preventable losses. A preventable loss is any business cost caused by deliberate or inadvertent human actions, colloquially known as \"shrinkage\". Deliberate human actions that cause loss to a retail company can be theft, fraud, vandalism, waste, abuse, or misconduct. Inadvertent human actions attributable to loss are poorly executed business processes, where employees fail to follow existing policies or procedures – or cases in which business policies and procedures are lacking. Loss prevention is mainly found within the retail sector but also can be found within other business environments.\n\nSince retail loss prevention is geared towards the elimination of preventable loss and the bulk of preventable loss in retail is caused by deliberate human activity, traditional approaches to retail loss prevention have been through visible security measures matched with technology such as CCTV and electronic sensor barriers. Most companies take this traditional approach by either having their own in-house loss prevention team or using external security agencies. Charles A. Sennewald and John H. Christman state, \"Four elements are necessary for a successful loss prevention plan: 1) Total support from top management, 2) A positive employee attitude, 3) Maximum use of all available resources, 4) A system which establishes both responsibility and accountability for loss prevention through evaluations that are consistent and progressive.\"\n\nPeriodically retail business inventories all of the merchandise in the store. Items that are unaccounted for compared to what the inventory system believes the store should have are losses or \"shrink\". Shrink is caused by operational errors, internal theft, and external theft. Retail loss prevention is responsible for identifying these causes and following up with training, preventing, investigating, responding to and resolving them. According to the 2018 National Retail Federal National Retail Security Survey, the average Shrink % for US Retailers is 1.33%. \n\nOperational errors are inadvertent human errors. Operational errors occur when associates do not follow existing business best practices and policies or a company lacks the proper best practices and policies to ensure work is performed with minimal human error. Operational errors also occur due to a lack of proper training for associates.\n\nExternal theft is when customers intentionally cause shrink by theft, fraud, or vandalism. 80% of customers who steal merchandise are opportunists and do not walk into the store with the intent to steal. They find that one thing they did not expect to find, cannot afford to pay for it, and will steal it if they have the opportunity. Others are desperate who will steal essentials for their family, but only if they have the opportunity. A few steal because they like the adrenaline rush and will steal, regardless of how much money they have if they have the opportunity. The remainder are \"boosters\" who are thieves for a living, walk in with the full intent to steal and sell their goods for a profit, on their own, or to a \"fence\" that sells stolen merchandise.\n\nThe vast majority of thieves have one thing in common, they will steal only if they have the opportunity. So theft prevention is fairly easy. Constant and great customer service will eliminate most opportunity to steal. However, there are those who are not as easily deterred. Prevention techniques commonly used are customer service, Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) with inventory control devices, uninformed or plain-clothed security or loss prevention personnel, surveillance systems, dummy cameras, locked display cases, etc.\n\nRetail loss prevention uses several prevention techniques because, like most things, there is no one answer for everything. Once all prevention measures are in place, resolving external theft in many companies includes apprehending shoplifters. State laws vary and allow business owners or representatives of the company to detain shoplifters with \"reasonable force\" for a \"reasonable amount of time\" until law enforcement arrives. Several companies have designated trained individuals who are allowed to detain shoplifters according to company policy. Modern retail loss prevention teams use surveillance techniques with camera systems or on the sales floor or a combination. Working in teams has its advantages since one person can man the cameras while the rest of the team observes on the sales floor as individual shoppers in disguise or male and female loss prevention agents posing as a couple.\n\nPolicy from company to company varies, but are basically the same. There are very specific elements that Loss Prevention must observe before detaining a shoplifter.\n\nSome of the typical elements are:\n\nIn some companies, entering a restroom or fitting room is broken surveillance and elements must start over. Observe the subject pass all points of sale. In some states, the point of sale may be the line of cash registers or the front door. One must observe the subject exit the store.\n\nIf any of the elements used by the company are not observed, Loss Prevention may not detain the subject according to company policy. The use of force or detain the shoplifter varies from company to company and take local and state laws into consideration.\n\nDetaining an individual who did not take merchandise is referred to as a \"bad stop\", and depending on the severity of the situation and if force was used against the innocent business patron will depend on the severity of the consequences for the loss prevention agent. Consequences for a bad stop may include a civil lawsuit, corrective action from the company up to and including termination, criminal prosecution for kidnapping is possible if an innocent customer is moved and detained against their will, etc. So mistakes are not an option and the fear of making mistakes can be very stressful.\n\nIn cases of internal theft, company employees intentionally cause shrink by theft, fraud, vandalism, waste, abuse, or misconduct. Because associates have access to the entire building and during non-business hours, they are capable of costing the company substantial losses over a longer period of time. Internal theft is typically identified by reporting systems, first-hand visual/CCTV surveillance or tips from coworkers.\n\nUnauthorized price markdowns on a computerized inventory system or dishonest operation of a computerized cash register will be evident on several store reports. Item markdowns, overrides, line item voids, suspended transactions, hand-keyed merchandise, refunds outside of normal transaction perimeters, cash over/shorts, and other reports will record dishonest behavior, which can be identified by an experienced user. Many companies hire a third-party to run algorithms on cash register reports to search for specific patterns and behaviors to recognize dishonest behavior. When these patterns are identified, loss prevention is notified to investigate if the behavior is intentional theft, policy violation or an inadvertent error that can be solved with additional training.\n\nAssociate merchandise theft that does not involve a computer or cash register is more difficult to identify because the offender must be witnessed directly. Whether prompted by suspicious behavior or expression, an anonymous tip, or intuition, internal theft cases are usually investigated with the use of video surveillance systems or a plainclothes loss prevention worker that the associate has not been introduced to. Because offending employees tend to adhere to a single method of theft, the installation of hidden surveillance cameras in a work area (provided company policy and local/state laws allow it) generally gives loss prevention an advantage in resolving the situation.\n\nOnce the internal theft has been proven, all required evidence has been collected, and approval is given by appropriate loss prevention or human resource management, loss prevention will bring the associate to the office for interview or interrogation. There are a few scenarios where a certified loss prevention agent will pull an associate based on a tip, rumor, or intuition and conduct a \"cold interview\" to attempt to acquire a verbal admission, but most companies do not allow cold interviews, as the implementations of the interview may be perceived by the associate to be an accusation of theft and have issues with civil liabilities that may result. It is often wiser to wait and complete a thorough investigation before conducting an interview unless you have a Certified Forensic Interrogator (CFI) attached to the name.\n\nOnce the interview is complete, Loss Prevention may proceed in several ways depending on the information gathered during the investigation and during the interview. Again, the investigation should identify if the associate's behavior was intentional theft, a policy violation or an inadvertent error that can be solved with additional training. If intentional theft is discovered, the police may be called and criminal charges filed. The severity of the criminal punishment will depend on the amount of property/cash/merchandise the company has lost due to the associate's dishonest/illegal behavior. To file criminal charges, the exact dollar amount stolen/lost must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to hold up in a criminal trial. Termination of employment due to theft will most likely be an outcome of the investigation.\n\nIn addition to criminal prosecution, companies have the option to seek civil restitution. In a lot of theft cases, the company loses property that cannot be returned or recovered. Since the dishonest associate represented the company, the reputation of the company may have been tarnished, relationships with business partners may suffer or terminate, and the possibility of lost business opportunities with new clients. The company also uses a lot of resources, technology, and payroll to investigate internal theft, and any other possible losses or \"damages\" incurred by the company due to the associate's dishonest behavior allow the company to partner with a legal firm or their own legal department to demand civil restitution from the former associate in the amount determined by a case-by-case basis. Failure of the former associate to pay the civil restitution may result in the company filing a civil lawsuit.\n\nThe development of electronic article surveillance (a magnetic device attached to the merchandise that would trigger an alarm if removed from the store, also called EAS) led to an increase in arrests; however, many cases have been dismissed due to lack of observation of the crime. A later effort, called \"benefit denial\" by Read Hayes, was intended to reduce the incentives for people to take the items by destroying the usefulness of items that were improperly removed from stores through the use of measures such as exploding dye packs (ink tags).\n\nInternal loss, as with other forms of shrinkage, can be classified as either \"malicious\" or \"non-malicious\".\n\nThe malicious internal loss is shrinkage caused by individuals from within the business such as staff members and cleaning staff and anyone else involved internally in the company. Internal shrink accounted for 35 percent of shrink to businesses in 2011. Internal shrink is caused by methods such as staff members stealing products, cashiers not ringing sales through the tills and keeping the payment for themselves, package pilferage, staff selling products to friends and family at discounted prices, \"sweethearting\" by giving products for free to friends and family by staff, colluding with maintenance staff or external contractors to steal products, and under-ringing merchandise on the tills for friends or family so they end up paying less for the items.\n\nInternal theft traditionally causes more loss to a business than external theft due to the increased opportunity available to internal staff members. \"A well-informed security superintendent of a nationwide chain of retail stores has estimated that it takes between forty and fifty shoplifting incidents to equal the annual loss caused by one dishonest individual inside an organization.\"\n\nNon-malicious shrinkage can result from a number of operational failures within the business structure. The processing of returned or damaged stock, for example, can cause articles to be removed from inventory and discarded (which contributes directly to shrinkage) rather than sold at a discount, donated, returned to vendors for credit, or otherwise removed from inventory in a manner that minimizes financial loss.\n\nThe image of retail loss prevention has become linked with the controversial practice of civil recovery.\n\nIn the United States, laws were enacted in the 1970s allowing merchants to be awarded damages from those who removed merchandise without paying. Some say this law then began the development of departments that focused on retail loss prevention. In more modern times, merchants expanded \"recovery\" to include larger monetary damage awards. The controversy surrounds large retailers suing thieves in civil court for up to ten times the replacement cost of the merchandise stolen. These recovery amounts, argued by merchants, are for the costs associated with the detection, prevention, and prosecution of theft. In most cases, these recovery claims are secured voluntarily, in conjunction with criminal charges. Judges like to see a penitent thief repaying merchants for their crimes. It is more likely that people caught for stealing would voluntarily pay these claims rather than endure them appearing on their credit report as judgments.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9224931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9224931", "title": "Same-store sales", "text": "Same-store sales\n\nSame-store sales is a business term which refers to the difference in revenue generated by a retail chain's existing outlets over a certain period (often a fiscal quarter or a particular shopping season), compared to an identical period in the past, usually in the previous year. By comparing sales data from existing outlets (that is, by excluding new outlets or outlets which have since closed), the comparison is like-to-like, and avoids comparing data that are fundamentally incomparable. This financial and operational metric is expressed as a percentage.\n\nSame-store sales are also known as comparable store sales, identical store sales or like-store sales.\n\nSame-store sales are widely reported by publicly owned retail chains as a key element of their operational results. For chains that are growing quickly by opening new outlets, same store sales figures allow analysts to differentiate between revenue growth that comes from new stores, and growth from improved operations at existing outlets.\n\nBy comparing how well existing outlets perform during a particular week compared to that same week in the previous year, business trends can be measured more accurately. Seasonal and geographical variations are removed from the measurement: instead of collecting an average over spans of time and location, annual changes in performance are revealed.\n\nGrowing same store sales can be explained by a number of reasons, including: marketshare gains in a retailer's trade areas; higher average purchases and/or more frequent customer visits; and successfully cross-selling into a broader product range or upselling to more expensive ones.\n\nSustained negative same store sales is a sure telltale that a retailer is in trouble. As large retail chains expand geographically they eventually run out of prime locations and often end up cannibalizing their existing stores to some extent, which leads to a relative decline in this metric. A rapid expansion in the number of stores followed a few years later by weak same store sales numbers shows (in hindsight) that the store additions might have been careless or rushed.\n\nSpecific store sales can also be compared. For example, a retail chain's finding that its same store sales at location A for the week-long shopping rush before Christmas are greater than those at location B is a useful piece of data. That data would have been less useful if only chain-wide sales for that week were known (with all stores averaged together), or if only year-long sales were known for that particular store. This makes same store sales a useful metric not only for external assessments of a retailer's performance, but also for internal benchmarking guiding store opening, remodelling and closing decisions.\n\nThere are numerous approaches to calculating comp store sales growth with most of these falling into two broad methodologies:\n\nThe criteria used to include or exclude stores from comp growth is also widely varied and often driven by the convenience and availability of data. \n\n\nThis methodology looks at a store's trading history and if the store has sufficient history to satisfy the current and prior comparative period (PCP), then the store is flagged as a comp store. Trading results are then filtered for comp stores only and then measures such as Comp Sales Growth, Comp Profit Growth, etc can be evaluated. Mathematically the length of trading history required to satisfy comp criteria will vary depending on the type of period being reported as per the following examples:\nFor simplicity, some organisations simply classify stores as comp only after they have had two full years of trading. The downside of this approach is that a store could be excluded even though there are relevant YOY results that could provide insight.\n\nThis methodology considers individual store periods (such as weeks or months) and classifies these as either comp or non-comp. For example, assume we are in week 12 of the retail year and a store opened in week 5 of the prior retail year. \n"}

An example of this would be starting fermentation in a carboy or stainless steel tank and then moving it over to oak barrels. Rather than being a separate, second fermentation, this is most often one single fermentation period that is conducted in multiple vessels. However, the term does also apply to procedures that could be described as a second and distinct fermentation period.\n\nIn sparkling wine production, the secondary fermentation often takes places in the wine bottle that the wine will be sold in. This is most commonly known as the \"méthode champenoise\" or \"Champagne method\" after the region most noted for sparkling wine production. When the base wine (or \"cuvee\") has been produced from single grape varietals or a blend, the wine is bottled with a mixture of yeast and fresh sugar known as the \"liqueur de tirage\". This secondary fermentation, also known as bottle fermentation, is the process that makes the wine \"bubbly\" due to the containment of carbon dioxide which is normally released as a by product in regular fermentation. \n\nIn still wine production, particularly of red wines and some white wines like Chardonnay, the secondary fermentation process can also usher in the use of malolactic fermentation (or MLF) where the hard, green apple-like malic acid is converted into softer, butter-like lactic acid. In the case of a stuck fermentation, a winemaker may wish to transfer the must to a second vessel and use stronger, more aggressive yeasts with high fermentation temperatures to re-initiate the fermentation process. A similar process known as \"governo\" has been used by Tuscan winemakers since the 14th century with the isolation after harvest of a batch of grapes that can be added later to the wine to help prevent (or recover from) a stuck fermentation.\n\n\n\n"}

In most cases, this comes down to its rules having the property of \"preserving truth\".\n\nA system with syntactic entailment formula_1 and semantic entailment formula_2 is sound if for any sequence formula_3 of sentences in its language, if formula_4, then formula_5. In other words, a system is sound when all of its theorems are tautologies.\n\nSoundness is among the most fundamental properties of mathematical logic. The soundness property provides the initial reason for counting a logical system as desirable. The completeness property means that every validity (truth) is provable. Together they imply that all and only validities are provable.\n\nMost proofs of soundness are trivial. For example, in an axiomatic system, proof of soundness amounts to verifying the validity of the axioms and that the rules of inference preserve validity (or the weaker property, truth). Most axiomatic systems have only the rule of modus ponens (and sometimes substitution), so it requires only verifying the validity of the axioms and one rule of inference.\n\nSoundness properties come in two main varieties: weak and strong soundness, of which the former is a restricted form of the latter.\n\nSoundness of a deductive system is the property that any sentence that is provable in that deductive system is also true on all interpretations or structures of the semantic theory for the language upon which that theory is based. In symbols, where \"S\" is the deductive system, \"L\" the language together with its semantic theory, and \"P\" a sentence of \"L\": if ⊢ \"P\", then also ⊨ \"P\".\n\nStrong soundness of a deductive system is the property that any sentence \"P\" of the language upon which the deductive system is based that is derivable from a set Γ of sentences of that language is also a logical consequence of that set, in the sense that any model that makes all members of Γ true will also make \"P\" true. In symbols where Γ is a set of sentences of \"L\": if Γ ⊢ \"P\", then also Γ ⊨ \"P\". Notice that in the statement of strong soundness, when Γ is empty, we have the statement of weak soundness.\n\nIf \"T\" is a theory whose objects of discourse can be interpreted as natural numbers, we say \"T\" is \"arithmetically sound\" if all theorems of \"T\" are actually true about the standard mathematical integers. For further information, see ω-consistent theory.\n\nThe converse of the soundness property is the semantic completeness property. A deductive system with a semantic theory is strongly complete if every sentence \"P\" that is a semantic consequence of a set of sentences Γ can be derived in the deduction system from that set. In symbols: whenever , then also . Completeness of first-order logic was first explicitly established by Gödel, though some of the main results were contained in earlier work of Skolem.\n\nInformally, a soundness theorem for a deductive system expresses that all provable sentences are true. Completeness states that all true sentences are provable.\n\nGödel's first incompleteness theorem shows that for languages sufficient for doing a certain amount of arithmetic, there can be no effective deductive system that is complete with respect to the intended interpretation of the symbolism of that language. Thus, not all sound deductive systems are complete in this special sense of completeness, in which the class of models (up to isomorphism) is restricted to the intended one. The original completeness proof applies to \"all\" classical models, not some special proper subclass of intended ones.\n\n\n\n"}

Steele's work is strongly influenced by his travel experiences in Germany, Western Europe and elsewhere, and is further enriched by experiences in Asia and Australia, mainly concerning indigenous people's problems, which were his concern during his year and a half of working at the Australian education department. He wrote two important books about relationships between the indigenous and non-indigenous populations, \"Flugi kun kakatuoj\" (2010) — published in English as \"Soaring with cockatoos\" (2012) and in French as \"Comme un vol d'oiseaux sacrés\" (2013) — and \"Paradizo ŝtelita\" (\"Paradise stolen\", 2012). His autobiography, \"Konvinka kamuflaĵo\" (\"Convincing camouflage\"), was published in 2014.\n\nSteele's books are grounded in authenticity, to which he adds a bit of fantasy. Except for \"Apenaŭ papilioj en Bergen-Belsen\", originally written in English as \"No butterflies in Bergen-Belsen\", all his published books were written originally in Esperanto, after which he translated them for possible publication in English. He once told Chuck Smith that while his Esperanto books sold steadily and found a ready publisher, he had many more difficulties in marketing his English works.\nSteele has contributed essays to \"Beletra Almanako\", the three-times-a-year periodical of Esperanto belles-lettres. One piece, \"Aurelius skribis a. P.\", appeared in the March 2008 issue, and \"Aventuroj de naivulo en la oceano de literatura 'business\"' (\"Adventures of a simpleton\"), appeared in the September 2008 issue. The first of these imagines Aurelius, a sympathetic but skeptical Roman, writing a biography of Jesus after interviewing witnesses to his life from before the time of Apostle Paul, and thereby provides background to Steele's later book \"Reluctant Messiah.\"\n\nThe second essay tells of Steele's attempts to have some of his English-language manuscripts published. University of Queensland Press, an honest publisher, showed him their stacks of manuscripts reaching to the ceiling and poignantly told him they could only publish six books peer year. He happened to fall victim to a vanity press scheme, which bilked him and then declared bankruptcy before it was exposed as fraudulent. He once tried publishing through Lulu.com, but found that their service resulted in his books having a prohibitively high cover price. Later, he tried to deal with a literary agent.\n\nAt the 82nd World Congress of Esperanto in Adelaide, Steele delivered a lecture about the life and work of the late Patrick White (1912–1990), an accomplished fellow Australian who had won the 1973 Nobel Prize in Literature. The Esperanto text of that lecture is available on line.\n\nFrom the beginning of 2002 until April 2004 Steele worked as director general of the World Esperanto Association's central office. However, he had little previous administrative experience, a fact he freely admits, and after criticism from other people within the office and in the association in general, he announced his resignation in October 2003. \"One reason was that I felt that as the director general in Rotterdam I was, paradoxically, not able to do much for Esperanto,\" he laments. \"When I was in Lithuania, for example, I taught the language to probably a thousand people, but in Rotterdam there was nothing doing in that regard.\"\n\nReturning to Australia, Steele taught German and mediaeval and modern history at a Steiner school before his retirement from teaching. Until 2010 Steele was an elected member of the Akademio de Esperanto, the independent body of language scholars who shepherd the evolution of the planned language Esperanto.\n\nIn 2014 Steele's English translation of Brazilian Esperantist Gersi Alfredo Bays's work \"La Profeto el Pedras\" (2000) appeared under the title \"The prophet from Pedras\" (Mondial, 192 pages, ). \"Loving Nora\", his English translation of Anja Saskia Beyer's German-language \"Himbeersommer\" was also e-published that year (Amazon Digital, 228 pages, ASIN B00IFVXK3U)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18103506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18103506", "title": "Tripping (pipe)", "text": "Tripping (pipe)\n\nTripping pipe (or \"Making a round trip\" or simply \"Making a trip\") is the physical act of pulling the drill string out of the wellbore and then running it back in. This is done by physically breaking out or disconnecting (when pulling out of the hole) \"every other 2 or 3 joints of drill pipe\" at a time (called a stand) and racking them vertically in the derrick. When feasible the driller will start each successive trip on a different \"break\" so that after several trips fresh pipe dope will have been applied (when running back in the hole) to every segment of the drill string.\n\nThe most typical reason for tripping pipe is to replace a worn-out drill bit. Though there are many problems that occur to warrant the tripping of pipe. Downhole tools such as MWD (measurement while drilling), LWD (logging while drilling) or mud motors break down quite often. Another common reason for tripping is to replace damaged drill pipe. It is important to get the pipe out of the wellbore quickly and safely before it can snap.\n\nDrill bits wear and tear like most any other piece of equipment. Once a bit becomes too worn to drill at an adequate rate or make a full-gauge hole, or if the bearings are thought to be near failure, a trip is undertaken to replace the bit. A trip is not considered a bit trip when the purpose of replacing the bit is to change sizes. This is only done when the crew \"sets surface, intermediate or longstring\" as appropriate.\n\nA fishing trip is when a crew is forced to trip pipe to retrieve loose items in the wellbore. This can result from something being dropped in the hole, i.e. a tool, that would cause damage to the bit if the crew attempted to drill with it on bottom. \n\nAnother major cause is known as a \"twist off\". Twisting off is when the drill string parts by failing catastrophically under the torsional stress. This may happen if the drill string below is pinched in the wellbore, or as the result of a structural weakening of the pipe caused by a washout or a crack in a threaded connection member.\n\nWhen pipe snaps or a part of the bit breaks off, the crew has to recover all of the separated items from the wellbore. Recovering snapped pipe usually involves placing a specialized tool (an \"overshot\") with grips set inside of it over the broken pipe in an attempt to capture it. The grip works in a manner similar to Chinese fingercuffs. Sometimes the jagged top of the fish must be milled back to a round outside shape before the overshot can slip over it. The overshot contains a packoff device to make a pressure seal so circulation can be reestablished through the bit to facilitate recovery of the fish. For a broken bit, a magnet is commonly used to remove all of the broken parts.\n\nA cracked pipe can lead to a broken string. Extra care is taken when tripping for one so that too much pull does not cause the cracked pipe to snap. Cracked pipes (i.e., washouts) are usually noticed by a sudden drop in pressure. The crew will usually pump \"fastline\" (small lengths of manila rope taken from unraveled catline) down the drill string to make a temporary plug and time the pressure to see when it rises back to normal. This enables the crew to know how far down to expect the cracked pipe to be within a few stands; also strands of these rope segments may be seen at the point of washout. Most trips for a cracked pipe are not complete trips like a fishing trip or a bit trip. These can be as simple as only going a few stands down, to pulling the drill collars.\n\nLogging of the open hole may take place at various depths while drilling, and almost always at the end of the drilling operation. The drill string will be removed from the wellbore to allow a logging crew to conduct a survey of the well. After the logging is completed at total depth, the crew will run the drill string back into the well and then proceed to lay it down when coming out of the hole prior to installing the final set of casing (the \"production casing\").\n\nThese trips are routinely expected by the crew. Setting surface occurs after the wellbore is drilled to the predetermined surface depth (e.g., after drilling below fresh water strata). The crew will remove the entire drill string to allow surface casing to be emplaced. The procedure is similar for setting intermediate, only that it typically involves a much longer drill string to be removed. Setting longstring is usually a one time operation combining both surface and intermediate casing. This saves the time of only having to undertake one pipe trip as opposed to two pipe trips.\n\n"}

A player who plays two instruments from the same family (e.g., oboe and English horn, clarinet and bass clarinet, flute and piccolo) is also often considered a woodwind doubler, but is usually paid less than a player who plays instruments from different families.\n\nLongtime classical music practice has expected the non-principal player in a section to double the common auxiliary instrument (e.g., 2nd flute and piccolo; 2nd oboe and English horn). In commercial work, including Hollywood film scores and—most notably—Broadway musicals, the practice gradually evolved, with some specialists developing great expertise with multiple members of three, four, or even all five of the woodwind families noted above. In such commercial work, players are paid an additional (percentage) premium for each additional double—but hiring four or five proficient \"reed doublers\" is still more cost-effective to the production than hiring numerous additional players. Even before 1940, Broadway reed players were commonly expected to double three, four, or five instruments; one of the most notorious mid-century examples was the Reed III book for \"West Side Story\" (1957), requiring flute, piccolo, oboe, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, and tenor & baritone saxophones.\n\nThe term \"doubler\" applies no matter how many instruments the musician plays. Someone who plays saxophone, flute, and clarinet is not a \"tripler\".\n"}
