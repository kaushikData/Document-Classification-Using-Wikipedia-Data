The alphabet was officially adopted by the Institute of National Language (). \n\nThe Abakada alphabet has since been superseded by the modern Filipino alphabet adopted in 1987. \n\nThe collation of letters in the Abakada closely follows those of other Latin-based spelling systems, with the digraph \"ng\" inserted after \"n\". \n\nWhen spelling or naming each consonant, its sound is always pronounced with an \"a\" at the end (e.g. \"ba\", \"ka\", etc). This is also the reason for the system’s name.\n\nDuring the pre-Hispanic era, Old Tagalog was written using the Kawi or the Baybayin script. \nFor three centuries Tagalog was written following, to some extent, the Spanish phonetic and orthographic rules.\n\nDr. José Rizal, was one of several proponents (including Trinidad Pardo de Tavera) of reforming the orthographies of the various Philippine languages in the late 19th-century. Like other proponents, he suggested to \"indigenize\" the alphabet of the Philippine languages by replacing the letters \"C\" and \"Q\" with \"K\". Initially, these reforms were not broadly adopted when they were proposed but gradually became popular into the early 20th century. \n\nFollowing the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, the government selected Tagalog as basis for a \"national language\" (i.e. Filipino). Following this, the development of a dictionary and grammar book for this \"national language\" started. In 1939, Lope K. Santos developed the \"Ang Balarila ng Wikang Pambansa\" (The Grammar of the National Language) which, apart from containing grammar rules, contained the 20-letter alphabet designated as \"Abakada\".\n\nThe Abakada was replaced in 1976 with an expanded alphabet containing an additional 11 letters (C, CH, F, J, LL, Ñ, Q, RR, V, X, and Z) which was in turn replaced with the current 28-letter modern alphabet. At present, all languages of the Philippines may be written using the modern Filipino alphabet (officially adopted in 1987), which includes all the letters of the Abakada.\n\n"}

He published a number of books on early Asian and Middle-Eastern languages, initially in French and then in English. Lacouperie is best known for his studies of the Yi Ching and his argument, known as Sino-Babylonianism, that the important elements of ancient civilization in ancient China came from Mesopotamia and that there were resemblances between Chinese characters and Akkadian hieroglyphics.\n\nThe American sinologist E. Bruce Brooks writes that Lacouperie \"gained a sufficiently accurate view of the Spring and Autumn period that he realized, half a century before Chyen Mu and Owen Lattimore, that the 'Chinese' territory of that period was in fact honeycombed with non-Sinitic peoples and even states.\" Brooks concluded that the \"whole trend of Lacouperie's thought still provokes a collective allergic reaction in Sinology and its neighbor sciences; only now are some of the larger questions he raised, and doubtless mishandled, coming to be hesitantly askable.\"\n\nTerrien died in London at his residence, 136 Bishop's Road, Fulham, leaving a widow.\n\nBiographical detail on Terrien is scant, some notices drawing on Royal Asiatic Society records and prefaces. He was born in November 1844 in Ingouville, Le Havre, Normandy. He was a descendant of the Cornish family of Terrien, which emigrated in the 17th century during the English Civil War, and acquired the property of La Couperie in Normandy. Some bibliographies append \"Baron\" to his name and it appears he published under the name Albert Étienne Jean-Baptiste Terrien de Lahaymonnais Peixotte de Poncel, Baron de La Couperie, but there is no record of the family being ennobled. His father was a merchant, and Albert received a business education.\n\nIn early life he settled at Hong Kong, where he soon turned his attention from commerce to the study of oriental languages, and he acquired an especially intimate knowledge of the Chinese language. In 1867, he published a philological work, \"Du Langage, Essai sur la Nature et l'Étude des Mots et des Langues\" (Paris, 8 volumes), which attracted considerable attention. Soon after, his attention was attracted by the progress made in deciphering Babylonian inscriptions, and by the resemblance between the Chinese characters and the early Akkadian language hieroglyphics.\n\nThe comparative philology of the two languages occupied most of his later life, and he was able to show an early affinity between them. In 1879, he went to London, was elected a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, and began to write works in English. In 1884, he became professor of comparative philology, as applied to the languages of South-Eastern Asia, at University College, London.\n\nIn the 1880s, he was also employed on several short-term contracts to work on the East-Asian coin collection at the British Museum. In 1892, he published his \"Catalogue of Chinese Coins from the VIIth Century BC to AS 621 including the Series in the British Museum\", for which the Académie des Inscriptions, France, awarded him the Stanislas Julien Prize, worth 1,500 French francs, \"for the best work relating to China\".\n\nHis last years were largely occupied by a study of the I Ching, or \"Book of Changes\". Its meaning had long proved a puzzle both to native and to foreign scholars. Terrien demonstrated that the basis of the work consisted of fragmentary notes, chiefly lexical in character, and noticed that they bore a close resemblance to the syllabaries of Chaldaea. In 1892, he published the first part of an explanatory treatise \"The Oldest Book of the Chinese\" (London, 8 volumes), in which he stated his theory of the nature of the I Ching, and gave translations of passages from it. The treatise, however, was not completed before his death.\n\nIn recognition of his services to oriental study he received a Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Leuven. He also enjoyed for a time a small pension from the French government, and after that had been withdrawn an unsuccessful attempt was made by his friends to obtain him an equivalent from the English ministry. He was twice awarded the \"prix Stanislas Julien\" by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres for his services to oriental philology.\n\nLacouperie's translations and Sino-Babylonian theories that the origins of Chinese civilization lay in Mesopotamia impressed the public but were criticised or dismissed by sinologists then and in following years. James Legge, whose translations of the Chinese Classics appeared at the same time as Terrien's and are still considered standard, questioned Terrien's sinological competence. Legge's review of Lacouperie's translation of the I Ching charged that only \"hasty ignorance\" could have led to the mistakes, which included failing to consult the basic reference, the Kangxi Dictionary. Another reviewer at the time labelled Terrien a \"specious wonder-monger.\" But the final decline of Lacouperie's comparativist theories of the origins of Chinese civilisation was marked by the attacks of University of Leiden sinologist, Gustav Schlegel. Schlegel and following Orientalists insisted on the independent origin and growth of Chinese civilisation. In particular, these scholars pointed out that monosyllabic Chinese characters could not be equated to polysyllabic Chaldean words; that in any case, Assyriological knowledge was \"dangerously uncertain\" and too unreliable to make such claims; and that it had not even been established that Babylonian civilization was earlier than Chinese.\n\nLacouperie's theory on the Babylonion origins of the sixty year ganzhi cyclical calendar system has fared little better, as the two systems differed both in concept and function: the Babylonion decimal system was used to count up to 60, where the cycle started again, while the Chinese system combined a cycle of twelve and a cycle of ten.\n\nLacouperie's ideas received attention from some Chinese intellectuals and nationalists, in support of anti-Manchu racist theories (founded on those of Herbert Spencer and the \"Yellow Book\") that were current at the beginning of the 20th century. His theory of a Western origin of Chinese civilization had reached Japan around the same time, the academic refutation did not stop it becoming a prevalent and populist notion.\n\nThe idea for a mythical script, native to Formosa, was founded on a formulation of the author, though he also noted the paucity in quality of information from that region.\n\nA more durable contribution to scholarship was Lacouperie's identification of the ancient names of the Indian Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts from research in Chinese sources.\n\nBesides the works mentioned, Terrien was the author of:\n\n\nMany of these treatises were reprinted from the \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society\" and other publications. He also edited the \"Babylonian and Oriental Record\" from 1886.\n\n\n"}

He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nDuranti was trained in linguistics at the Sapienza University of Rome (laurea, 1974), where he studied general linguistics and ethnolinguistics with (1943-1988), and at the University of Southern California (PhD, 1981), where he specialized in Bantu languages under Larry Hyman while working with Elinor Ochs on the conversational foundations of Italian word order patterns. His dissertation, \"The Fono: A Samoan Speech Event\", based on 13 months of fieldwork in the (then Western) Samoan community of Falefā, on the island of ‘Upolu, focused on the language and social organization of the meeting of the local ‘council’ (fono) that he analyzed by extending Dell Hymes’ Speech Event Model to include speechmaking across speakers and situations.\n\nDuranti fully embraced an anthropological perspective on language through his collaboration with Elinor Ochs during and after their fieldwork in (then Western) Samoa in 1978-79 and 1981. In 1980-81, Duranti was a postdoctoral fellow at the Australian National University where he was part of a Working Group on Language and Context under the direction of Roger Keesing. In 1980-81, the core group, which met regularly throughout the year, included Elinor Ochs, John B. Haviland, Penelope Brown, Steven Levinson, and Robert Van Valin, Jr. In 1983-84, Duranti was a postdoctoral fellow at the Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC) at the University of California, San Diego, directed by Michael Cole. After teaching at the University of Rome, Pitzer College, and the University of California at San Diego, Duranti joined the Anthropology Department at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1988. In the 1990s, he carried out fieldwork among Samoan immigrants in Southern California to study, in collaboration with Elinor Ochs, how second generation Samoan children were being socialized in the context of a bicultural, bilingual environment. \n\nIn 1987 Duranti (in collaboration with Bambi Schieffelin) founded the journal IPrA Papers in Pragmatics, later renamed Pragmatics. In 1992, he co-edited with Charles Goodwin \"Rethinking Context: Language as an Interactive Phenomenon\", a collection of essays that continues to be widely read and cited as one of the key references on the study of the relationship between language and context. In 1994, Duranti published \"From Grammar to Politics: Linguistic Anthropology in a Western Samoan Village\" (University of California Press), an ethnography of Samoan ways of speaking that integrates the analysis of the spatio-temporal dimensions of speech events with the detailed analysis of the grammatical patterns used in political arenas and in more informal interaction to manage what Duranti called “the moral flow of discourse.” This was the beginning of his interest in how agency is\nexpressed and enacted through language, a topic that he has since explored in a number of publications. In 1995-96, using a combination of participant-observation and videography, Duranti documented the political campaign for the U.S. Congress of Walter Capps, then Professor of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In support of this project, in 1999 he received a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship. After completing a treatise on the field of linguistic anthropology for the Cambridge University Press series in linguistics (Duranti 1997), he dedicated himself to editing a number of collections to make recent research on language and culture accessible to a wider range of students and scholars (Duranti 2001a, 2001b, 2004). \n\nIn 2002, Duranti started a collaboration with legendary jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell, with the goal of documenting jazz culture and teaching jazz aesthetics to students in the social sciences. One product of their collaboration is a course on the culture of jazz aesthetics, where jazz musicians are invited to play and talk about their music. The video recording of their class, student concerts, and other events in which jazz is taught, played, and discussed at the university and elsewhere has produced hundreds of hours of audio visual documentation of the contemporary jazz scene in Los Angeles.\n\nSince the late 1980s, Duranti has also had an active role in editing journals and books. In 1990-1994, he was an associate editor of \"American Ethnologist\" and in 1999-2001 he was editor of the \"Journal of Linguistic Anthropology\". \n\nDuranti’s most recent work, \"The Anthropology of Intentions: Language in a World of Others\", investigates his long-held interests on the limits of focusing on speakers’ intentions for understanding language as action. His earlier critique of speech act theory is here expanded to a broader discussion of intentionality and intersubjectivity inspired by Edmund Husserl’s writings and supported by examples drawn from three of his research projects: his ethnographic study of Samoan ways of speaking, the audio-visual documentation of the 1995-96 political campaign of Walter Capps for the U.S. Congress, and a study of the culture of jazz aesthetics and improvisation. Duranti demonstrates how “cognitive, emotional, and embodied dispositions [are] always embedded in an intersubjective world of experience.” Duranti introduces into anthropological theory the novel concept of the \"intentional continuum\" to describe “a range of graded ways of being disposed or mentally (and sensorially) connected with some entity in the world.” In his review of the book, the developmental psychologist Martin J. Packer demonstrates how the intentional continuum is a necessary expansion to the standard theory of mind found in John Searle:\n\nThe standard components of theory of mind—beliefs, desires, and goals—capture only a small part of this continuum. Searle’s (1983) attempt to reduce all points on the continuum to the fundamental Intentional states of belief and desire seems less than satisfying…When we understand another person’s actions, or grasp the meaning of their words, we are paying attention to one part or another of this continuum, “seeing as” in ways that have been shaped by the culture in which we live.\n\nIn her review of the book, the anthropologist and linguist Jane H. Hill writes that “Duranti aims here to move away from homogeneous characterizations of whole cultures as inattentive or attentive to \"mens rea\" toward richer and more deeply contextualized accounts of exactly when, by whom, and how such attention is given or withheld.” Duranti’s book is the subject of a 2017 Book Symposium in , which includes response from Eve Danziger, Shaun Gallagher and the authors of the other featured book, \"The Concept of Action\", N.J Enfield and Jack Sidnell.\n\n\n\n"}

In the initial phase of his spiritual revolution, he moved out from the group of Sthanakvasi Acharya Raghunath. That time he had 13 saints, 13 followers and 13 the basic rules. This coincidence results in the name of \"Terapanth\" (Thirteen Path).\n\nThe various beliefs and teachings of the religious orders of those times greatly influenced his thinking. He studied and analysed the various disciplines of the Jain religion and on this basis he compiled his own ideologies and principles of the Jain way of life. Based on the doctrines propagated, Acharya Bhikshu rigorously followed the principles. It was this way of life that was demonstrated by Acharya Bhikshu which became the foundation principle of Terapanth. The Letter of Conduct was written by him is still followed in the same manner with due respect with slight changes as per the time & situation. The original copy of letter written in Rajasthani language is still available. His followers piously referred to this monk as 'Swamiji'.\n\nAcharya Bhikshu visualised a systematic, well established and orderly religious sect and saw it taking shape through \"Terapanth\". To organise and stabilise this religious order he propagated the ideology of one guru and brought to an end the concept of self discipleship. In this way his ideology of one Acharya, one principle, one thought and similar thinking became the ideal for other religious sects. Acharya Bhikshu said the common man should understand and practise true religion which would take him to the path of salvation.\n\nAcharya Bhikshu (aka Bhikhanji) was born in Kantaliya in Rajasthan in 1726. He belonged to a merchant class named Bisa Oswal. He was initiated as a monk by a Sthanakvasi Acarya Ragunathji in 1751. He broke away from Sthanakvasi sect after receiving complaints from numerous lay followers in 1759. Upon reading the scriptures, he found that the order of monks have wandered away from true teachings of Jainism; Ragunathji seconded the same but was unwilling to bring the same in the sect as they were hard to follow by the other monks.\n\nIn the middle of the 18th century, Acharya Bhikshu led a reformist movement. A philosopher, writer, poet and social reformer, he wrote 38,000 \"shlokas\", now compiled in two volumes as \"Bhikshu Granth Ratnakar\". His \"Nav Padarth Sadbhav\", which advocated a society free from exploitation, and is regarded as a significant philosophical composition that deals exhaustively with the nine gems of Jain philosophy.\n\nOn 30 June 2004, the vice-president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat had released a special commemorative postage stamp in memory of Jain saint Acharya Shri Bhikshu on the occasion of the \"nirvana\" bicentenary. The stamp issued by the Department of Posts is in Rs. 5 denomination. Two special functions were organised to release this Rs. 5/- stamp. The first function was organised at the residence of Vice-President of India, Shri Bhairo Singh Shekhavat at New Delhi. Second release function was organised at Siriyari (Distt. Pali, Rajasthan) where Acharya Bhikshu had attained Nirvana.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18401299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18401299", "title": "Bible translations into Japanese", "text": "Bible translations into Japanese\n\nThere are two main translations of the Bible into Japanese widely in use today—the New Interconfessional Version () and the New Japanese Bible (). Both are published by the Japan Bible Society but with different translation goals. The New Japanese Version aims to be used as a literal translation using modern Japanese while the New Interconfessional Version aims to be ecumenically used by all Christian denominations and must therefore conform to various theologies. Protestant Evangelicals most often use the New Japanese Version but the most widely distributed Bible and the one used by the Catholic Church, the United Church of Christ, Lutheran Church factions and many Anglicans in Japan is the New Interconfessional Version.\n\nJapanese Bible translation began when Catholic missionaries (\"Kirishitan\") entered Japan in 1549, and Jesuits published portions of the New Testament in Kyoto, in 1613, though no copy survives. Exactly how much was translated by the Jesuit Mission is not confirmed. It would seem that at least Gospels for the Sundays of the year and other Bible pericopes were translated. Shortly afterwards, however, Christianity was banned and all the missionaries were exiled. That translation of the Bible is now lost.\n\nWork on translation started outside Japan in the 19th century by Protestant missionaries interested in Japan. Karl Gutzlaff of the London Missionary Society translated the Gospel of John in Macau in 1837, referring to the Chinese version of Robert Morrison (Chinese \"Shentian Shengshu\" 神天聖書). Bernard Jean Bettelheim, who had been a missionary in the Ryūkyū Kingdom (Okinawa) and who had been exiled, translated the Bible to Ryūkyūan and published the Gospel of Luke and John, Acts of the Apostles and the Epistle to the Romans in Hong Kong in 1855. Japan re-opened in 1858, and many missionaries came into the country. They found that intellectuals could read Chinese texts easily, so they used Chinese Bibles at first. However, the proportion of intellectuals was only in the region of 2% and in order to spread their religion across the country more effectively, a Japanese Bible became necessary. Incidentally, a second reversion of Bettelheim's Luke was published in 1858, intercolumnated with the Chinese Delegates' version, and designed for missionary use in Japan. This version, with its heavy Ryūkyūan flavor, proved just as unsuitable as Chinese-only Bibles. After leaving Asia and immigrating to the United States, Bettelheim continued work on his translations, and newly revised editions of Luke, John, and the Acts, now closer to Japanese than Ryūkyūan, were published posthumously in Vienna in 1873-1874 with the assistance of August Pfizmaier.\n\nA translation was done by James Curtis Hepburn, of the Presbyterian Mission, and Samuel Robbins Brown, of the Reformed Church of America. It is presumed that Japanese intellectual assistants helped translate Bridgman and Culbertson's Chinese Bible (1861) into Japanese, and Hepburn and Brown adjusted the phrases. The Gospels of Mark, Matthew and John were published in 1872. Hepburn's project was taken over by a Missionary Committee, sponsored by the American Bible Society, British and Foreign Bible Society and the Scottish Bible Society in Tokyo. Their New Testament and Old Testament, called the Meiji Version (明治元訳 \"meiji genyaku\", \"Meiji era Original Translation\"), was published in 1880 and 1887 respectively. They translated from a Greek text as well as the King James version.\n\nA revision of the New Testament, the \"Taisho Revised Version\" (大正改訳聖書 \"taisho kaiyaku seisho\", \"Taisho era Revised Translation of Scripture\") appeared in 1917 during the Taishō period. This version was widely read even outside of Christian society. Its phrases are pre-modern style, but became popular in Japan. This was based on the Nestle-Aland Greek Text and the English Revised Version (RV).\n\nAfter World War II, the translated the \"\". The New Testament being ready in 1954 and the Old Testament in 1955. It was adopted by certain Protestant churches but never became really popular, perhaps because of its poor literary style. This translation was based on the Revised Standard Version (RSV).\n\nBased on the New Living Translation this translation has an informal literary style which attempts to capture the meaning of the original texts in modern Japanese. Revised version released in 2016 by Word of Life press.\n\n1977 version available online in PDF form from Biblica and at bible.com\n\nIn 1970 the - different from the - released the first edition of the which was translated from Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek (Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia and Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece). The \"Shin Kaiyaku\" endeavors to translate theologically difficult passages in a way that is linguistically accurate to the source texts, to strike a balance between word-for-word and thought-for-thought but erring toward a literal translation.\n\nThe latest edition was released in 2017.\n\nThe Second Vatican Council decided to promote ecumenism and emphasized respect for the Bible. Consortia between the Catholic and the Protestant churches were organized and translation projects started in many countries, including Japan. The collaboration committee published the of the New Testament in 1978, but it was not widely supported by both congregations, Catholic and Protestant. The committee then published a revised version in 1987, the , which included the Old Testament. It has been distributed well by various organisations such as Gideons International, the next edition is planned to be released in 2016.\n\nThere are many other Japanese translations of the Bible by various organizations and individuals.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, Emile Raguet of the MEP translated the New Testament from the Vulgate Latin version and published it in 1910. It was treated as the standard text by Japanese Catholics. Federico Barbaro colloquialized it (published in 1957). He went on to translate the Old Testament in 1964.\n\nThe Franciscans completed a translation of the whole Bible, based on the Greek and Hebrew text, in 1978. This project was inspired by the Jerusalem Bible.\n\nIn the Orthodox Church, Nicholas and Tsugumaro Nakai translated the New Testament as an official text in 1901, but the 1954 Colloquial Translation is often used.\n\nThe Watch Tower Society published its Japanese translation of the New Testament in 1973 and the full \"New World Translation (NWT)\" in Japanese in 1982; by the end of that year, tens of thousands of copies had been printed in Japan. Japanese was among the first eight languages into which \"NWT\" was translated, and a Japanese \"References\" edition of the \"NWT\" was published in 1985.\n\nDownloadable\n\nOnline\n"}

Katz and Mair argue that \"parties in Western Europe have adapted themselves to declining levels of participation and involvement in party activities by not only turning to resources provided by the state but by doing so in a collusive manner\".\n\nThe concept of the cartel party was first proposed in 1992 as a means of drawing attention to the patterns of inter-party collusion or cooperation rather than competition; and as a way of emphasising the influence of the state on party development. In definitional terms, the cartel party is a type of party that emerges in advanced democratic polities and that is characterised by the interpenetration of party and state and by a pattern of inter-party collusion. With the development of the cartel party, the goals of politics become self-referential, professional and technocratic, and what little inter-party competition remains becomes focused on the efficient and effective management of the polity. The election campaigns that are conducted by cartel parties are capital-intensive, professionalized and centralized, and are organized on the basis of a strong reliance on the state for financial subventions and for other benefits and privileges. Within the party, the distinction between party members and non-members becomes blurred, in that through primaries, electronic polling, and so on, the parties invite all of their supporters, members or not, to participate in party activities and decision-making. Above all, with the emergence of cartel parties, politics becomes increasingly depoliticised.\n\n"}

In 1946, after serving in the Army, Charles \"Honi\" Coles and Cholly Atkins collaborated as a dance duo that became highly acclaimed. British dance critic Edward Thorpe, in his 1989 book, \"Black Dance,\" described Coles and Atkins as \n\nFor black dancers of the jazz age and the swing era, the noun phrase, \"class act,\" had a more nuanced meaning. According to Cholly Atkins, some performers and managers harbored stereotypical preferences of how black male dancers and musical comedy dance teams should dress and perform. To those performers and managers, a class act was more apropos for white male entertainers. Black entertainers who did it were likely to be perceived as defiant. Atkins, in his 2001 book, \"Class Act\" (co-authored with Jacqui Malone), stated that,\n\nAgainst the backdrop of dance teams working in the blackface tradition, Atkins was one in a long list of virtuoso black male dance artists who rejected the minstrel-show stereotypes of the grinning-and-dancing clowns lazy, incompetent fools and dandies who thought only of flashy clothes, flirtatious courting, new dances, and good looks.

It was adopted by the General Assembly on 20 November 1963. The Declaration was an important precursor to the legally binding Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.\n\nThe Declaration follows the structure of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with a preamble followed by eleven articles.\n\nArticle 1 declares that discrimination on the basis of race, colour or ethnicity is \"an offence to human dignity\" and condemns it as a violation of the principles underlying the United Nations Charter, a violation of human rights and a threat to peace and security.\n\nArticle 2 calls on states, institutions, groups and individuals not to discriminate on the basis of race in human rights. It calls on states to end support for discrimination, and to take affirmative action where necessary to correct it.\n\nArticle 3 calls for particular efforts to end racial discrimination in civil rights, housing, employment, education, and calls for everyone to have free access to public places and services regardless of race.\n\nArticle 4 calls on states to review policies and repeal laws which discriminate on the basis of race.\n\nArticle 5 calls for an end to racial segregation and apartheid.\n\nArticle 6 calls for an end to racial discrimination in political rights, in particular the right to vote and stand for public office.\n\nArticle 7 declares that everyone has the right to equality before the law and to equal justice before the law regardless of race. It calls for everyone to have an effective remedy, enforceable through the courts, for harm suffered through racial discrimination.\n\nArticle 8 calls for education to promote tolerance and racial understanding.\n\nArticle 9 condemns propaganda and organisations based on the idea of racial supremacism. It calls for incitements to racial violence, or hate speech to be criminalised, and for racist organisations to be outlawed.\n\nArticle 10 calls on the United Nations to study the causes of racial discrimination so as to better combat it.\n\nArticle 11 calls on every state to promote respect of fundamental human rights and the principles of this declaration and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\nAs a declaration rather than a treaty, the document is non-binding.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1250786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1250786", "title": "Ecological effects of biodiversity", "text": "Ecological effects of biodiversity\n\nThe diversity of species and genes in ecological communities affects the functioning of these communities. These ecological effects of biodiversity in turn are affected by both climate change through enhanced greenhouse gases, aerosols and loss of land cover, and biological diversity, causing a rapid loss of ecosystems and extinctions of species and local populations. The current rate of extinction is sometimes considered a mass extinction, with current species extinction rates on the order of 100 to 1000 times as high as in the past.\n\nThe two main areas where the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function have been studied are the relationship between diversity and productivity, and the relationship between diversity and community stability. More biologically diverse communities appear to be more productive (in terms of biomass production) than are less diverse communities, and they appear to be more stable in the face of perturbations.\n\nAlso animals that inhabit an area may alter the surviving conditions by factors assimilated by climate.\n\nIn order to understand the effects that changes in biodiversity will have on ecosystem functioning, it is important to define some terms. Biodiversity is not easily defined, but may be thought of as the number and/or evenness of genes, species, and ecosystems in a region. This definition includes genetic diversity, or the diversity of genes within a species, species diversity, or the diversity of species within a habitat or region, and ecosystem diversity, or the diversity of habitats within a region.\n\nTwo things commonly measured in relation to changes in diversity are productivity and stability. Productivity is a measure of ecosystem function. It is generally measured by taking the total aboveground biomass of all plants in an area. Many assume that it can be used as a general indicator of ecosystem function and that total resource use and other indicators of ecosystem function are correlated with productivity.\n\nStability is much more difficult to define, but can be generally thought of in two ways. General stability of a population is a measure that assumes stability is higher if there is less of a chance of extinction. This kind of stability is generally measured by measuring the variability of aggregate community properties, like total biomass, over time. The other definition of stability is a measure of resilience and resistance, where an ecosystem that returns quickly to an equilibrium after a perturbation or resists invasion is thought of as more stable than one that does not.\n\nThe importance of stability in community ecology is clear. An unstable ecosystem will be more likely to lose species. Thus, if there is indeed a link between diversity and stability, it is likely that losses of diversity could feedback on themselves, causing even more losses of species. Productivity, on the other hand, has a less clear importance in community ecology. In managed areas like cropland, and in areas where animals are grown or caught, increasing productivity increases the economic success of the area and implies that the area has become more efficient, leading to possible long term resource sustainability. It is more difficult to find the importance of productivity in natural ecosystems.\n\nBeyond the value biodiversity has in regulating and stabilizing ecosystem processes, there are direct economic consequences of losing diversity in certain ecosystems and in the world as a whole. Losing species means losing potential foods, medicines, industrial products, and tourism, all of which have a direct economic effect on peoples lives.\n\n\nField experiments to test the degree to which diversity affects community productivity have had variable results, but many long term studies in grassland ecosystems have found that diversity does indeed enhance the productivity of ecosystems. Additionally, evidence of this relationship has also been found in grassland microcosms. The differing results between studies may partially be attributable to their reliance on samples with equal species diversities rather than species diversities that mirror those observed in the environment. A 2006 experiment utilizing a realistic variation in species composition for its grassland samples found a positive correlation between increased diversity and increased production.\n\nHowever, these studies have come to different conclusions as to whether the cause was due more to diversity or to species composition. Specifically, a diversity in the functional roles of the species may be a more important quality for predicting productivity than the diversity in species number. Recent mathematical models have highlighted the importance of ecological context in unraveling this problem. Some models have indicated the importance of disturbance rates and spatial heterogeneity of the environment, others have indicated that the time since disturbance and the habitat's carrying capacity can cause differing relationships. Each ecological context should yield not only a different relationship, but a different contribution to the relationship due to diversity and to composition. The current consensus holds at least that certain combinations of species provide increased community productivity.\n\nIn order to correctly identify the consequences of diversity on productivity and other ecosystem processes, many things must happen. First, it is imperative that scientists stop looking for a single relationship. It is obvious now from the models, the data, and the theory that there is no one overarching effect of diversity on productivity. Scientists must try to quantify the differences between composition effect and diversity effects, as many experiments never quantify the final realized species diversity (instead only counting numbers of species of seeds planted) and confound a sampling effect for facilitators (a compositional factor) with diversity effects.\n\nRelative amounts of overyielding (or how much more a species grows when grown with other species than it does in monoculture) should be used rather than absolute amounts as relative overyielding can give clues as to the mechanism by which diversity is influencing productivity, however if experimental protocols are incomplete, one may be able to indicate the existence of a complementary or facilitative effect in the experiment, but not be able to recognize its cause. Experimenters should know what the goal of their experiment is, that is, whether it is meant to inform natural or managed ecosystems, as the sampling effect may only be a real effect of diversity in natural ecosystems (managed ecosystems are composed to maximize complementarity and facilitation regardless of species number). By knowing this, they should be able to choose spatial and temporal scales that are appropriate for their experiment. Lastly, to resolve the diversity-function debate, it is advisable that experiments be done with large amounts of spatial and resource heterogeneity and environmental fluctuation over time, as these types of experiments should be able to demonstrate the diversity-function relationship more easily.\n\n\nModels have predicted that empirical relationships between temporal variation of community productivity and species diversity are indeed real, and that they almost have to be. Some temporal stability data can be almost completely explained by the averaging effect by constructing null models to test the data against. Competition, which causes negative covariances, only serves to strengthen these relationships.\n\nThis area is more contentious than the area of temporal stability, mostly because some have tried generalizing the findings of the temporal stability models and theory to stability in general. While the relationship between temporal variations in productivity and diversity has a mathematical cause, which will allow the relationship to be seen much more often than not, it is not the case with resistance/resilience stability. Some experimenters have seen a correlation between diversity and reduced invasibility, though many have also seen the opposite. The correlation between diversity and disease is also tenuous, though theory and data do seem to support it.\n\nIn order to more fully understand the effects of diversity on the temporal stability of ecosystems it is necessary to recognize that they are bound to occur. By constructing null models to test the data against (as in Doak et al. 1998) it becomes possible to find situations and ecological contexts where ecosystems become more or less stable than they should be. Finding these contexts would allow for mechanistic studies into why these ecosystems are more stable, which may allow for applications in conservation management.\n\nMore importantly more complete experiments into whether diverse ecosystems actually resist invasion and disease better than their less diverse equivalents as invasion and disease are two important factors that lead to species extinctions in the present day.\n\nOne major problem with both the diversity-productivity and diversity-stability debates discussed up to this point is that both focus on interactions at just a single trophic level. That is, they are concerned with only one level of the food web, namely plants. Other research, unconcerned with the effects of diversity, has demonstrated strong top-down forcing of ecosystems (see keystone species). There is very little actual data available regarding the effects of different food webs, but theory helps us in this area. First, if a food web in an ecosystem has a lot of weak interactions between different species, then it should have more stable populations and the community as a whole should be more stable. If upper levels of the web are more diverse, then there will be less biomass in the lower levels and if lower levels are more diverse they will better be able to resist consumption and be more stable in the face of consumption. Also, top-down forcing should be reduced in less diverse ecosystems because of the bias for species in higher trophic levels to go extinct first. Lastly, it has recently been shown that consumers can dramatically change the biodiversity-productivity-stability relationships that are implied by plants alone. Thus, it will be important in the future to incorporate food web theory into the future study of the effects of biodiversity. In addition this complexity will need to be addressed when designing biodiversity management plans.\n\n"}
{"id": "436829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436829", "title": "English verbs", "text": "English verbs\n\nVerbs constitute one of the main word classes in the English language. Like other types of words in the language, English verbs are not heavily inflected. Most combinations of tense, aspect, mood and voice are expressed periphrastically, using constructions with auxiliary verbs.\n\nGenerally, the only inflected forms of an English verb are a third person singular present tense form in \"-s\", a past tense (also called preterite), a past participle (which may be the same as the past tense), and a form ending in \"-ing\" that serves as a present participle and gerund. Most verbs inflect in a simple regular fashion, although there are about 200 irregular verbs; the irregularity in nearly all cases concerns the past tense and past participle forms. The copula verb \"be\" has a larger number of different inflected forms, and is highly irregular.\n\nFor details of the uses of particular verb tenses and other forms, see the article Uses of English verb forms. For certain other specific topics, see the articles listed in the adjacent box.\n\nA regular English verb has only one principal part, from which all the forms of the verb can be derived. This is the base form or dictionary form. For example, from the base form \"exist\", all the inflected forms of the verb (\"exist\", \"exists\", \"existed\", \"existing\") can be predictably derived. The base form is also called the bare infinitive; another common way of referring to verbs is to use the \"to\"-infinitive, e.g. \"to exist\".\n\nMost irregular verbs have three principal parts, since the simple past and past participle are unpredictable. For example, the verb \"write\" has the principal parts \"write\" (base form), \"wrote\" (past), and \"written\" (past participle); the remaining inflected forms (\"writes\", \"writing\") are derived regularly from the base form. Note that some irregular verbs have identical past tense and past participle forms (as the regular verbs do), as with \"send–sent–sent\".\n\nThe verbs \"do\", \"say\" and \"have\" additionally have irregular third person singular present tense forms (see below). The copular verb \"be\" is highly irregular, with the forms \"be\", \"am\", \"is\", \"are\", \"was\", \"were\", \"been\" and \"being\". On the other hand, modal verbs (such as \"can\" and \"must\") are defective verbs, being used only in a limited number of forms. For details on the forms of verbs of these types, see below.\n\nThe base form or \"plain form\" of a verb is not marked by any inflectional ending. There are certain derivational suffixes that are frequently used to form verbs, such as \"-ate\" (\"formulate\"), \"-fy\" (\"electrify\"), and \"-ise/ize\" (\"realise/realize\"). Many verbs also contain prefixes, such \"un-\" (\"unmask\"), \"out-\" (\"outlast\"), \"over-\" (\"overtake\"), and \"under-\" (\"undervalue\"). Some verbs are formed from nouns and adjectives by conversion, as with the verbs \"snare\", \"nose\", \"dry\", and \"calm\".\n\nThe base form is used in the following ways:\nFor the verb \"be\", which uses different forms for the simple present, and modal verbs, which are not used in the infinitive, imperative or subjunctive, see below.\n\nAlmost all verbs have a third person singular present indicative form with the suffix \"-[e]s\". In terms of spelling, it is formed in most cases by adding \"-s\" to the verb's base form: \"run\" → \"runs\". However if the base form ends in one of the sibilant sounds (, , , , , ) and its spelling does not end in a silent \"e\", then \"-es\" is added: \"buzz\" → \"buzzes\"; \"catch\" → \"catches\". Verbs ending in a consonant plus \"o\" also typically add \"-es\": \"veto\" → \"vetoes\". Verbs ending in a consonant plus \"y\" add \"-es\" after changing the \"y\" to an \"i\": \"cry\" → \"cries\".\n\nIn terms of pronunciation, the ending is pronounced as after sibilants (as in \"lurches\"), as after voiceless consonants other than sibilants (as in \"makes\"), and as otherwise (as in \"adds\"). These are the same rules that apply to the pronunciation of the regular noun plural suffix \"-[e]s\" and the possessive \"-'s\". The spelling rules given above are also very similar to those for the plural of nouns.\n\nThe third person singular present of \"have\" is irregular: \"has\" (with the weak form when used as an auxiliary, also contractable to \"-'s\"). The verbs \"do\" and \"say\" also have irregular forms, \"does\" and \"says\" , which however look like regular forms in writing.\n\nFor the verb \"be\", modal verbs and other auxiliaries, see below.\n\nThe form described in this section is used with third person singular subjects as the simple present tense (in the indicative mood): \"He writes novels all the time.\" (This tense has other uses besides referring to present time; for example, in \"I'll be glad if he writes\", it refers to future time.)\n\nThe past tense, or preterite, may be formed regularly or irregularly.\n\nWith regular verbs, the past tense is formed (in terms of spelling) by adding \"-ed\" to the base form (\"play\" → \"played\"). Normal rules for adding suffixes beginning with a vowel apply: If the base form ends in \"e\" then only \"d\" is added (\"like\" → \"liked\"); if the base form ends in a consonant followed by \"y\" then the \"y\" is changed to \"i\" before adding the ending (\"try\" → \"tried\"; an exception is the verb \"sky\" (a ball), which can form \"skied\" or \"skyed\").\n\nVarious rules apply for doubling final consonants. If the base form ends in a single vowel followed by a single consonant (except \"h\", silent \"t\", \"w\", \"x\" and \"y\"), then unless the final syllable is completely unstressed, the consonant is doubled before adding the \"-ed\" (\"ship\" → \"shipped\", but \"fathom\" → \"fathomed\"). For most base forms ending in \"c\", the doubled form used is \"ck\", and this is used regardless of stress (\"panic\" → \"panicked\"; exceptions include \"zinc\" → \"zincked\" or \"zinced\", \"arc\" → usually \"arced\", \"spec\" → \"specced\" or \"spec'ed\", \"sync\" → sometimes \"synched\"). In British English, the doubling of \"l\" occurs regardless of stress (\"travel\" → \"travelled\"; but \"paralleled\" is an exception), and when two separately-pronounced vowels precede the \"l\" (\"dial\" → \"dialled\", \"fuel\" → \"fuelled\").\n\nIf the final syllable has some partial stress, especially for compound words, the consonant is usually doubled: \"backflip\" → \"backflipped\", \"hobnob\" → \"hobnobbed\", \"kidnap\" → \"kidnapped\" etc. In some cases both alternatives are acceptable, e.g. \"dialog\" → \"dialogued\" or \"dialogged\", \"gambol\" → \"gambolled\", \"hiccup\" → \"hiccupped\" or \"hiccuped\", \"program\" → \"programed\" or \"programmed\". Note however \"catalog\" → \"cataloged\", \"pyramid\" → \"pyramided\", \"format\" → \"formatted\" (but \"combat\" → \"combat(t)ed\"). Other variations not entirely consistent with these rules include \"bus\" → \"bused\" or \"bussed\", \"bias\" → \"biased\" or \"biassed\" and \"focus\" → \"focused\" or \"focussed\", .\n\nThe pronunciation of the past tense ending follows similar rules to those for the third person present tense ending described above: if the base form ends in or then a new syllable or is added (as in \"drifted\", \"exceeded\"); if the base form ends in an unvoiced consonant sound other than then the ending is pronounced (as in \"capped\", \"passed\"); otherwise the ending is pronounced (as in \"buzzed\", \"tangoed\"). Consequently, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the latter two pronunciations were routinely spelled \"-'d\", but \"-ed\" was later restored.\n\nFor the past tense of irregular verbs, see English irregular verbs. Some of these can be classed as Germanic strong verbs, such as \"sing\" (past \"sang\"), while others are weak verbs with irregularly pronounced or irregularly spelt past forms, such as \"say\" (past tense \"said\" ).\n\nThe verb \"be\" has two past tense forms: \"was\" (first and third person singular) and \"were\" (plural and second person).\n\nThe past tense (preterite) form is used in what is called the simple past, in sentences such as \"We lit the fire\" and \"He liked to dance\". One of the uses of this tense is to refer not to a past situation, but to a hypothetical (present or future) situation in a dependent clause: \"If I knew that, I wouldn't have to ask.\" This is sometimes called the \"past subjunctive\", particularly in the case of \"were\", which can replace \"was\" in such sentences; see English subjunctive.\n\nThe past participle of regular verbs is identical to the preterite (past tense) form, described in the previous section.\n\nFor irregular verbs, see English irregular verbs. Some of these have different past tense and past participle forms (like \"sing–sang–sung\"); others have the same form for both (like \"make–made–made\"). In some cases the past tense is regular but the past participle is not, as with \"show–showed–shown\".\n\nFor uses of the past participle, see below.\n\nThe present participle form, which is also used for the gerund, is formed by adding the suffix \"-ing\" to the base form: \"go\" → \"going\". A final silent \"e\" is dropped (\"believe\" → \"believing\"); final \"ie\" changes to \"y\" (\"lie\" → \"lying\"), and consonant doubling applies as for the past tense (see above): \"run\" → \"running\", \"panic\" → \"panicking\".\n\nSome exceptions include forms such as \"singeing\", \"dyeing\", \"ageing\", \"rueing\", \"cacheing\" and \"whingeing\", where the \"e\" may be retained to avoid confusion with otherwise identical words (e.g. \"singing\"), to clarify pronunciation (for example to show that a word has a soft \"g\" or \"ch\"), or for aesthetic reasons.\n\nIn standard English the ending is pronounced , although in many regional dialects the final consonant sound is pronounced , sometimes represented in eye dialect by spellings such as \"huntin\"' (see \"g\"-dropping).\n\nFor uses of the present participle and gerund, see below.\n\nThe copular verb \"be\" has multiple irregular forms in the present tense: \"am\" for first person singular (which together with the subject pronoun is often contracted to \"I'm\"), \"is\" for third person singular (often contracted to \" 's\"), and \"are\" for plural and second person (often contracted to \" 're\" chiefly after the pronouns \"you\", \"we\", \"they\"). It also has two past tense forms: \"was\" for first and third person singular, and \"were\" for plural and second person (also used as a past subjunctive with all persons; see English subjunctive). The past participle is \"been\", and the present participle and gerund is the regular \"being\". The base form \"be\" is used regularly as an infinitive, imperative and (present) subjunctive. For archaic forms, see the next section.\n\nEnglish has a number of modal verbs which generally do not inflect (most of them are surviving preterite-present verbs), and so have only a single form, used as a finite verb with subjects of all persons and numbers. These verbs are \"can\", \"could\", \"may\", \"might\", \"shall\", \"should\", \"will\", \"would\", \"must\", \"ought (to)\", as well as \"need\" and \"dare\" (when used with a bare infinitive), and in some analyses \"used (to)\" and \"had better\". (The forms \"could\", \"might\", \"should\" and \"would\" are considered to be the past tenses of \"can\", \"may\", \"shall\" and \"will\" respectively, although they are not always used as such.) These verbs do not have infinitive, imperative or participle forms, although in some cases there exists a synonymous phrase that can be used to produce such forms, such as \"be able to\" in the case of \"can\" and \"could\". The negation of \"can\" is the single word \"cannot\". There are contracted forms \" 'll\" and \" 'd\" for \"will\" and \"would\" (in some cases possibly considered to be from \"shall\" and \"should\").\n\nOther verbs used as auxiliaries include \"have\", chiefly in perfect constructions (the forms \"has\", \"have\" and \"had\" can contract to \" 's\", \" 've\" and \" 'd\"), and \"do\" (\"does\", \"did\") in emphatic, inverted and negated constructions (see \"do\"-support).\n\nFor more detail of the above, including contractions of negated forms (\"isn't\", \"won't\", etc.), see English auxiliaries and contractions.\n\nAnother example of a defective verb is \"beware\", which is used only in those forms in which \"be\" remains unchanged, namely the infinitive, subjunctive and imperative.\n\nFormerly, particularly in the Old English period, the English language had a far greater degree of verb inflection than it does now (other Germanic languages generally retain a greater variety of inflected forms than English does). Some of the forms used in Early Modern English have now fallen out of use, but are still encountered in old writers and texts (e.g. Shakespeare, the King James Bible) and in archaisms.\n\nOne such form was the third person singular form with the suffix \"-eth\" , pronounced as a full syllable. This was used in some dialects rather than the modern \"-s\", e.g. \"he maketh\" (\"he makes\"), \"he runneth\" (\"he runs\"), \"he goeth\" (\"he goes\"). In some verbs, a shortened form \"-th\" appears: \"he hath\" (\"he has\"), \"he doth\" (\"he does\"; pronounced as if written \"duth\"), \"he saith\" or \"he sayeth\" (\"he says\"). The forms \"hath\" and \"doth\" are found in some proverbs (\"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\", \"The lady doth protest too much\").\n\nAnother set of forms are associated with the archaic second person singular pronoun \"thou\", which often have the ending \"-est\", pronounced as a full syllable, e.g. \"thou makest\" (\"you make\"), \"thou leadest\" (\"you lead\"). In some verbs, a shortened form \"-st\" appears: \"thou hast\" (\"you have\"), \"thou dost\" (\"you do\"; rhymes with \"must\"). In the case of the verb \"be\", such forms included \"art\" (present tense), \"wast\" (past), \"wert\" (past subjunctive) and \"beest\" (present subjunctive; pronounced as two syllables). In all other verbs, the past tense is formed by the base past tense form of the word (e.g. \"had\", \"did\", \"listened\") plus\"-'st\", not pronounced as a full syllable, e.g. \"thou had'st\" (\"you had\"), \"thou did'st\" (\"you did\"), \"thou listened'st\" (\"you listened\"). Modal verbs except \"must\" also have \"-t\" or \"-st\" added to their form, e.g. \"thou canst\" (\"you can\"), \"thou wilt\" (\"you will\"), \"thou wouldst\" (\"you would\"), \"thou mightst\" (\"you might\"), except \"may\", which is \"thou mayest\" (\"you may\").\n\nFor example, several such forms (as well as other archaic forms such as \"yea\" for \"yes\", \"thy\" for \"your\", and \"mine enemies\" for \"my enemies\") appear in Psalm 23 from the King James Bible:\n\nFor more information see Old English verbs, English subjunctive, and Indo-European copula (for the history of the verb \"be\").\n\nApart from the simple past tense described above, English verbs do not have synthetic (inflected) forms for particular tenses, aspects or moods. However, there are a number of periphrastic (multi-word) constructions with verb forms that serve to express tense-like or aspect-like meanings; these constructions are commonly described as representing certain verb tenses or aspects (in English language teaching they are often simply called tenses). For the usage of these forms, see below. More detail can be found in the article Uses of English verb forms.\n\nThe progressive (or continuous) aspect is expressed with a form of \"be\" together with the present participle of the verb. Thus present progressive (present continuous) constructions take forms like \"am writing\", \"is writing\", \"are writing\", while the past progressive (past continuous, also called \"imperfect\") is \"was writing\", \"were writing\". There is a progressive infinitive \"(to) be writing\" and a progressive subjunctive \"be writing\". Other progressive forms, made with compound forms of \"be\", are described below.\n\nThe basic present and past tenses of the verb are called simple present (present simple) and simple past (past simple), to distinguish them from progressive or other compound forms. Thus the simple present of the above verb is \"write\" or \"writes\", and the simple past (also called preterite) is \"wrote\".\n\nThe perfect aspect is expressed with a form of the auxiliary \"have\" together with the past participle of the verb. Thus the present perfect is \"have written\" or \"has written\", and the past perfect (pluperfect) is \"had written\". The perfect can combine with the progressive aspect (see above) to produce the present perfect progressive (continuous) \"have/has been writing\" and the past perfect progressive (continuous) \"had been writing\". There is a perfect infinitive \"(to) have written\" and a perfect progressive infinitive \"(to) have been writing\", and corresponding present participle/gerund forms \"having written\" and \"having been writing\". A perfect subjunctive (\"have written\") is also sometimes used. Future and conditional perfect forms are given below.\n\nWhat is often called the future tense of English is formed using the auxiliary \"will\". The simple future is \"will write\", the future progressive (continuous) is \"will be writing\", the future perfect is \"will have written\", and the future perfect progressive (continuous) is \"will have been writing\". Traditionally (though now usually in formal English only) \"shall\" is used rather than \"will\" in the first person singular and plural; see \"shall\" and \"will\".\n\nThe conditional, or \"future-in-the-past\", forms are made analogously to these future forms, using \"would\" (and \"should\") in place of \"will\" (and \"shall\").\n\nThe passive voice in English is normally expressed with a form of the copula verb \"be\" (or sometimes \"get\") together with the past participle of the main verb. In this context \"be\" is not a stative verb, so it may occur in progressive forms. Examples:\n\nFor details, see English passive voice.\n\nImperatives are expressed with the base form of the verb, normally with no subject: \"Take this outside! Be good!\" It is possible to add the second person pronoun \"you\" for emphasis: \"You be good!\"\n\nMore details can be found in the article Imperative mood.\n\nQuestions are formed by subject–auxiliary inversion (unless the interrogative word is part of the subject). If there is otherwise no auxiliary, the verb \"do\" (\"does\", \"did\") is used as an auxiliary, enabling the inversion. This also applies to negation: the negating word \"not\" must follow an auxiliary, so \"do\" is used if there is no other auxiliary.\n\nInversion is also required in certain other types of sentences, mainly after negative adverbial phrases; here too \"do\" is used if there is no other auxiliary.\n\nThe construction with \"do\" as auxiliary is also used to enable emphasis to be added to a sentence.\n\nFor details of the above constructions, see \"do\"-support.\n\nThis section describes how the verb forms introduced in the preceding sections are used. More detail can be found in the article Uses of English verb forms and in the articles on the individual tenses and aspects.\n\nIn referring to an action taking place regularly (and not limited to the future or to the past), the simple present is used: \"He brushes his teeth every morning\". For an action taking place at the present time, the present progressive construction is used: \"He is brushing his teeth now\". With some verbs expressing a present state, particularly the copula \"be\" and verbs expressing a mental state, the present simple is generally used: \"They are here\"; \"I know that\". However other state verbs use the present progressive or present simple depending on whether the state is considered temporary or permanent: \"The pen is lying on the table\"; \"Paris lies on the Seine\".\n\nFor past actions or states, the simple past is generally used: \"He went out an hour ago\"; \"Columbus knew the shape of the world\". However, for completed actions for which no past time frame is implied or expressed, the present perfect is normally used: \"I have made the dinner\" (i.e. the dinner is now ready). For an action in the course of taking place, or a temporary state existing, at the past time being referred to (compare uses of the present progressive above), the past progressive is used: \"We were sitting on the beach when...\" For an action that was completed before the past time being referred to, the past perfect is used: \"We had sat down on the blanket when...\"\n\nFor actions or events expected to take place in the future, the construction with \"will\" can be used: \"The president will arrive tomorrow.\" Future events are also often expressed using the \"be going to\" construction: \"She is going to arrive tomorrow.\" Planned events can also be referred to using the present progressive (\"She is arriving tomorrow\") or, if precisely scheduled, the simple present (\"She arrives tomorrow\"). The future progressive and future perfect can be used analogously to the past equivalents: \"We will be sitting on the beach this afternoon\"; \"We will have left the house by 4 o'clock\". However, in subordinate clauses expressing a condition or a time reference, present forms are used rather than the forms with \"will\": \"If/When you get\" (not \"will get\") \"there...\"\n\nWhen expressing actions or events lasting up to a specified time, the appropriate perfect construction is used (with the progressive if expressing a temporary state that would generally be expressed with a progressive form): \"We have been having some problems lately\"; \"I have lived here for six years\"; \"We had been working since the previous evening\"; \"We will have been working for twelve hours by the time you arrive\".\n\nThe use of tense and aspectual forms in condition and conditional clauses follows special patterns; see conditional mood. For use of tenses in indirect speech, see sequence of tenses. For the use of subjunctive forms, see English subjunctive.\n\nThe bare infinitive, identical to the base form of the verb, is used as a complement of most modal verbs and certain other verbs (\"I can write; \"They made him write; \"I saw you write), including in negated and inverted sentences formed using \"do\"-support (\"He doesn't write; \"Did you write?\").\n\nPreceded by \"to\", it forms the \"to\"-infinitive, which has a variety of uses, including as a noun phrase (To write is to learn) and as the complement of many verbs (\"I want to write), as well as with certain adjectives and nouns (\"easy to ride; \"his decision to leave\"), and in expressions of purpose (\"You did it to spite me).\n\nThe past participle has the following uses:\n\nThe present participle has the following uses:\n\nThe same form used as a gerund has the following uses:\n\nThe logical subject of a phrase formed with a gerund can be expressed by a possessive, as in \"I do not like\" your/Jim's \"drinking wine\", although a non-possessive noun or pronoun is often used instead, especially in informal English: \"I do not like\" you/Jim \"drinking wine\". The latter usage, though common, is sometimes considered ungrammatical or stylistically poor; it is given names like \"fused participle\" and \"geriple\" since it is seen to confuse a participle with a gerund. For more information see fused participle.\n\nGerund forms are often used as plain verbal nouns, which function grammatically like common nouns (in particular, by being qualified by adjectives rather than adverbs): \"He did some excellent writing\" (compare the gerund: \"He is known for writing excellently\"). Such verbal nouns can function, for instance, as noun adjuncts, as in \"a writing desk\".\n\nVerbs are used in certain patterns which require the presence of specific arguments in the form of objects and other complements of particular types. (A given verb may be usable in one or more of these patterns.)\n\nA verb with a direct object is called a transitive verb. Some transitive verbs have an indirect object in addition to the direct object. Verbs used without objects are called intransitive. Both transitive and intransitive verbs may also have additional complements that are not considered objects.\n\nA single (direct) object generally follows the verb: \"I love you. If there is an indirect object, it precedes the direct object (\"I gave him the book\"), although an indirect object can also be expressed with a prepositional phrase following the direct object (and this method is usual when the direct object is a personal pronoun): \"I gave the book to John; \"I bought them for you.\n\nOther complements may include prepositional phrases, non-finite clauses and content clauses, depending on the applicable verb pattern. These complements normally follow any objects. For example:\n\nMore examples can be found at Verb patterns with the gerund.\n\nEnglish has a number of ergative verbs: verbs which can be used either intransitively or transitively, where in the intransitive use it is the subject that is receiving the action, and in the transitive use the direct object is receiving the action while the subject is causing it. An example is \"sink\": \"The ship sank\" (intransitive use); \"The explosion sank the ship\" (transitive use). Other common examples include \"open, sink, wake, melt, boil, collapse, explode, freeze, start, sell\".\n\nFor more details on how verbs are built up into clauses, see English clause syntax.\n\nMany English verbs are used in particular combinations with adverbial modifiers such as \"on\", \"away\", \"out\", etc. Often these combinations take on independent meanings. They are referred to as phrasal verbs. (This term may also include verbs used with a complement introduced by a particular preposition that gives it a special meaning, as in \"take to (someone)\".)\n\nThe adverbial particle in a phrasal verb generally appears close after the verb, though it may follow the object, particularly when the object is a pronoun: \"Hand over the money\" or \"Hand the money over\", but \"Hand it over\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1426546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1426546", "title": "Harmony Gold USA", "text": "Harmony Gold USA\n\nHarmony Gold is a real estate developer, motion picture and television distributor, and film, television, and animation production company, video game developer and publisher, based in Los Angeles. It was founded in 1983 by Egyptian-born Frank Agrama and is managed by his daughter, Jehan F. Agrama.\n\nThe company began by selling broadcast rights from Paramount Pictures to the Mediaset media conglomerate. It is best known as the distributor of the controversial \"Shaka Zulu\" miniseries and for various anime series, notably \"Robotech\".\n\nThe company worked closely with Intersound, a Los Angeles-based post-production recording studio, managed by Frank Agrama's son, Ahmed Agrama. They were responsible for partially dubbing \"Dragon Ball\", \"Magical Princess Minky Momo\" and \"Dr. Slump\" before going out of business in 2006.\n\nIn addition to its distribution and production interests, Harmony Gold manages several real estate properties in the Southern California area. They also operate a screening room in Los Angeles.\n\nHarmony Gold's story began in the 1976, when Frank Agrama began selling broadcast rights from Paramount Pictures to his friend, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset media company. In the late 1970s, Agrama, while in a trade fair in Cannes, France, met Hong Kong entrepreneurs Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun. The three agreed to form a collaboration to trade movie rights internationally. Chan set up Hong Kong-based company Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, while Agrama set up Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. \nIn 1983, Agrama set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles commercial representative of another of Chan's companies, Wiltshire Trading.\n\nIn late 1983, Agrama negotiated a deal with the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) to distribute the controversial \"Shaka Zulu\" miniseries in spite of the economic sanctions at the time. The planned 10-episode miniseries was based on the story of the king of the Zulu, Shaka (reigned 1816 to 1828), and the writings of the British traders with whom he interacted. In the same year, Agrama founded Harmony Gold.\n\nThroughout 1984 and 1985, the original budget of about $1.75 million escalated quickly to $12 million, and the SABC justified the outlay to anticipated returns to be earned on the international market. Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" \"Shaka Zulu\" had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script. The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by apartheid. The opening credits featured Harmony Gold, with Frank Agrama listed as associate producer.\n\n\"Shaka Zulu\" went on to become a massive success worldwide, and has developed a cult following since its premiere in 1986. It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the United States. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's \"The Hunters\" and the later \"The Gods Must be Crazy\" film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa. Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired Carl Macek to adapt Japanese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\", but was instead forced to combine three different anime series together, which became \"Robotech\":\n\n\nHarmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market \"Macross\" for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). \"Macross\" and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit a movie and a spin-off, \"\". Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.\n\nIn 1988, after the cancellation of \"\", a number of the staff were recruited to work at Saban Entertainment. Carl Macek, along with his friend Jerry Beck went on to found Streamline Pictures. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.\n\nIn 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to Mediaset.\n\nFrom 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with Netter Digital and hired Carl Macek to write \"Robotech 3000\", a spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 FanimeCon anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. Tatsunoko Productions attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.\n\nHarmony Gold began heavily pushing \"Robotech\", first by releasing the series via a partnership with ADV Films in the US, and Manga Entertainment in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with FUNimation Entertainment to release \"\" on home video.\n\nIn August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, \"The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines\". Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.\n\nHarmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the \"Corriere della Sera\", the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.\n\nOn November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's Mediaset media empire.\n\nOn October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy trial involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices. As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", on November 21, 2006 prosecutors in Milan, Italy charged Agrama, along with Berlusconi and ten others, in a trial over tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting at Mediaset.\n\nIn October 2011, Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun, along with nine others (including Frank Agrama and Pier Silvio Berlusconi, son of Silvio Berlusconi), were indicted by a Milan court and charged with buying rights for US television series and movies, then reselling them to broadcasting rights firm Mediatrade (a subsidiary of Mediaset) at inflated prices and laundering the money in a complex scheme. The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in Cannes, France in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.\n\nProsecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million. Earlier in 2005, Swiss investigators froze 150 million francs (HK$1.29 billion) at a UBS branch in Lugano belonging to Harmony Gold, Wiltshire Trading and other companies.\n\nOn July 24, 2014, \"Variety\" reported that some of the charges have been dropped due to expiring statute of limitations. An appeals hearing was set to take place January 20, 2016. On January 18, 2016, all charges against Frank Agrama and five other people were dropped. Berlusconi and Mediaset Chairman Fedele Confalonieri were convicted and were sentenced to 13 months of imprisonment.\n\nHarmony Gold, via its license of \"Robotech\", is the co-copyright owner in the US for images of mecha from the component series of the show, \"Super Dimension Fortress Macross\", \"Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross\", and \"Genesis Climber MOSPEADA\". They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.\n\nMost notably, many early designs used in \"Battletech\", such as the \"Warhammer\", \"Valkyrie\", and \"Marauder\", were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of Macross, with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued FASA, and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of Battletech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.\n\nHarmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a \"Warhammer\". The company claims that the images portray ’mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.\n\nIn 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that Hasbro's SDCC 2013 exclusive set \"G.I. Joe vs Transformers The Epic Conclusion\" violated their copyright license and trademarks on the animated Japanese Macross TV series (1982–84). On September 23, 2013, Harmony Gold's suit against Hasbro was dismissed with prejudice, and Hasbro was allowed to continue to sell the sets.\n\nThe legal status of Harmony Gold's license to Macross was dubious. Harmony Gold's license for \"Macross\" came from Tatsunoko Production, but Japanese courts ruled that it was Studio Nue (creators of the series) that controls the \"Macross\" intellectual property. The license Tatsunoko was given was for international distribution outside Japan only, and does not allow them to control the intellectual property. According to the US Copyright Office, Harmony Gold is the Co-Copyright owner until 2021.\n\nIn November 2016, Harmony Gold initiated arbitration against Tatsunoko, to which Tatsunoko responded with counterclaims. With the exception of the original visual depictions of 41 characters, which are owned by Big West Advertising not Tatsunoko, the arbitrator found that Harmony Gold had the rights to \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\", \"The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross\", and \"Genesis Climber Mospeada\" until their expiry on March 14, 2021, as per the licensing agreement. Harmony Gold also holds several trademarks related to Macross and its trademark for the Macross series was renewed on December 26, 2012. The expiration date for these will be ten years from that date, on December 26, 2022 but the pending expiration of the licensing agreement could affect the trademark ownership before 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarmony Gold was known in the United Kingdom as MasterVision in the VHS pre-certs sector. They released the same films on another UK label Kids Cartoon Collection for the home market during the 1985. Finding a MasterVision or Kids Cartoon Collection (a.k.a. Harmony Gold in the UK) is like striking a pot of Harmony Gold, as they were a rare brand of VHS in the UK. Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, \"The Little Train\" was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example \"The Brave Frog\" and \"Robotech\" in the UK.\n\n"}
{"id": "6227463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6227463", "title": "Hejazi Arabic", "text": "Hejazi Arabic\n\nHejazi Arabic or Hijazi Arabic ( '), also known as West Arabian Arabic, is a variety of Arabic spoken in the Hejaz region in Saudi Arabia. Strictly speaking, there are two main groups of dialects spoken in the Hejaz region, one by the urban population, originally spoken in the major cities of Jeddah, Mecca and Medina, and another by the Bedouin or rural populations. However, the term most often applies to the urban variety which is discussed in this article.\n\nIn antiquity, the Hejaz was home to the Old Hejazi dialect of Arabic. Old Hejazi is distinct from modern Hejazi Arabic, and represents an older linguistic layer wiped out by centuries of migration, but which happens to share the imperative prefix vowel /a-/ with the modern dialect.\n\nHejazi Arabic belongs to the western Peninsular Arabic branch of the Arabic language, which itself is a Semitic language. It includes features of both urban and bedouin dialects giving its history between the ancient urban cities of Medina and Mecca and the bedouin tribes that lived on the outskirts of these cities.\n\nAlso referred to as the sedentary Hejazi dialect, this is the form most commonly associated with the term \"Hejazi Arabic\", and is spoken in the urban centers of the region, such as Jeddah, Mecca, and Medina. With respect to the axis of bedouin versus sedentary dialects of the Arabic language, this dialect group exhibits features of both. Like other sedentary dialects, the urban Hejazi dialect is less conservative than the bedouin varieties in some aspects and has therefore shed some Classical forms and features that are still present in bedouin dialects, these include gender-number disagreement, and the feminine marker \"-n\" (see Varieties of Arabic). But in contrast to bedouin dialects, the constant use of full vowels and the absence of vowel reduction plus the distinction between the emphatic letters and is generally retained.\n\n\nThe Arabic of today is derived principally from the old dialects of Central and North Arabia which were divided by the classical Arab grammarians into three groups: Hejaz, Najd, and the language of the tribes in adjoining areas. Though the modern Hejazi dialects has developed markedly since the development of Classical Arabic, and Modern Standard Arabic is quite distinct from the modern dialect of Hejaz. Standard Arabic now differs considerably from modern Hejazi Arabic in terms of its phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon, such diglossia in Arabic began to emerge at the latest in the sixth century CE when oral poets recited their poetry in a proto-Classical Arabic based on archaic dialects which differed greatly from their own.\n\nHistorically, it is not well known in which stage of Arabic the shift from the Proto-Semitic pair to Hejazi occurred, although it has been attested as early as the eighth century CE, and it can be explained by a chain shift * → → that occurred in one of two ways:\n\nIn general, Hejazi native phonemic inventory consists of 26 to 28 consonant phonemes depending on the speaker's background and formality, while it has an eight-vowel system, consisting of three short and five long vowels , in addition to two diphthongs . Consonant length and Vowel length are both distinctive in Hejazi.\n\nThe main phonological feature that differentiates urban Hejazi from the neighboring urban and rural dialects of the Arabian peninsula, is the constant use of full vowels and the absence of vowel reduction, for example 'I told you' (to a female), is pronounced or in Hejazi with full vowels but pronounced with the reduced vowel as or in Najdi. In general it also retains the distinction between the letters and , but alternates between the pronunciations of the letters , and . (See , below.)\n\nA conservative phonological feature that Hejazi holds is the lack of palatalization for the letters , and , unlike in other peninsular dialects where they can be palatalized and merged with other phonemes in certain positions (to [t͡ʃ], [t͡s], [ʃ], or [s] in case of ك, [d͡ʒ] or [d͡z] in case of ق and in case of ج), it is also worth mentioning that this trait of non-palatalization is becoming common across Saudi Arabia especially in urban centers, another feature is that the ل is only velarized to /ɫ/ in the word الله /aɫːaːh/ 'god' (except when it follows an /i/: بسمِ الله or لله ) and words derived from it, unlike other peninsular dialects where it might be velarized allophonically, as in pronounced in Hejazi but in other peninsular Arabic dialects.\n\nPhonetic notes:\n\nPhonetic notes:\n\nMost of the occurrences of the two diphthongs and in the Classical Arabic period underwent monophthongization in Hejazi, and are realized as the long vowels and respectively, but they are still preserved as diphthongs in a number of words which created a contrast with the long vowels , , and .\n\nNot all instances of mid vowels are a result of monophthongization, some are from grammatical processes 'they said' → 'they said to her' (opposed to Classical Arabic ), and some occur in modern Portmanteau words e.g. 'why?' (from Classical Arabic 'for what' and 'thing').\n\nHejazi vocabulary derives primarily from Arabic Semitic roots. The urban Hejazi vocabulary differs in some respect from that of other dialects in the Arabian Peninsula. For example, there are fewer specialized terms related to desert life, and more terms related to seafaring and fishing. Loanwords are mainly of Persian, Turkish, Latin (French and Italian) and English origins, and due to the diverse origins of the inhabitants of Hejazi cities, some loanwords are only used by some families. A number of old loanwords are fading or became obsolete due to the influence of Modern Standard Arabic and their association with lower social class and education, e.g. \"air conditioner\" (from English \"Condition\") was replaced by Standard Arabic . Most of the loanwords are nouns (with a change of meaning sometimes) as in: \"shoe\" from Turkish originally meaning \"boot\" or \"overpass\" from originally meaning \"bridge\".\n\nSome general Hejazi expressions include \"good luck\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"not yet\", or \"already\", or \"now\", \"I want\", \"please/excuse me\" to a male and \"please/excuse me\" to a female.\n\nA common feature in Hejazi vocabulary is portmanteau words (also called a \"blend\" in linguistics); in which parts of multiple words or their phones (sounds) are combined into a new word, it is especially innovative in making Interrogative words, examples include:\n\nThe Cardinal number system in Hejazi is much more simplified than the Classical Arabic\nA system similar to the German numbers system is used for other numbers between 20 and above : 21 is which literally mean ('one and twenty') and 485 is which literally mean ('four hundred and five and eighty').\n\nUnlike Classical Arabic, the only number that is gender specific in Hejazi is \"one\" which has two forms \"m.\" and \"f.\" as in ('one book') or ('one car'), with being a masculine noun and a feminine noun.\n\n\nIn Hejazi Arabic, personal pronouns have eight forms. In singular, the 2nd and 3rd persons differentiate gender, while the 1st person and plural do not.\n\nHejazi Arabic verbs, as with the verbs in other Semitic languages, and the entire vocabulary in those languages, are based on a set of three, four also five consonants (but mainly three consonants) called a root (\"triliteral\" or \"quadriliteral\" according to the number of consonants). The root communicates the basic meaning of the verb, e.g. ' 'to write', ' 'to eat'. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as :\nHejazi Has a single indicative present verb mood instead of the three Classical Arabic present verb moods (indicative رفع, subjunctive نصب, jussive ), it also includes present progressive tense which was not part of the Classical Arabic grammar, and has a two grammatical number in verbs (Singular and Plural) instead of the Classical (Singular, Dual and Plural).\n\nThe most common verbs in Hejazi have a given vowel pattern for past (a and i) to present (a or u or i). Combinations of each exist:\n\nAccording to Arab grammarians, verbs are divided into three categories; Past ماضي, Present and Imperative . An example from the root ' the verb \"katabt/ʼa\"'ktub\" 'i wrote/i write' (which is a regular sound verb):\nWhile present progressive and future are indicated by adding the prefix (b-) and (ħ-) respectively to the present (indicative) :\n\n\nExample: katabt/aktub \"write\": non-finite forms\n\nActive participles act as adjectives, and so they must agree with their subject. An active participle can be used in several ways:\n\nEnclitic forms of object pronouns are suffixes that are affixed to various parts of speech, with varying meanings:\nUnlike Egyptian Arabic, in Hejazi no more than one pronoun can be suffixed to a word.\n\nModifications:-\n\nHejazi is written using the Arabic alphabet; like other varieties of Arabic, Hejazi does not have a standard form of writing and mostly follows Classical Arabic rules of writing. In general people alternate between writing the words according to their etymology or the phoneme used while pronouncing them, which mainly has an effect on the three letters and , for example writing instead of or instead of although this alternation in writing is not considered acceptable by all Hejazi speakers.\n\nAnother alternation which is more likely to appear happens when writing words that end in a short vowel , the writer would choose whether to add a vowel letter or at the end of the word as in ('you' singular feminine) to differentiate it from ('you' singular masculine), or use the Classical form which can be pronounced or , this happens since most word-final short vowels from the Classical Arabic period have been omitted and most word-final unstressed long vowel letters have been shortened in Hejazi. In Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written, and when needed to be written they are written in a form of diacritics; above the letter for , above the letter for , under the letter for .\n\nThe table below shows the Arabic alphabet letters and their corresponding phonemes in Hejazi: \n\nNotes:\n\n\nThe varieties of Arabic spoken in the smaller towns and by the bedouin tribes in the Hejaz region are relatively under-studied. However, the speech of some tribes shows much closer affinity to other bedouin dialects, particularly those of neighboring Najd, than to those of the urban Hejazi cities. The dialects of northern Hejazi tribes merge into those of Jordan and Sinai, while the dialects in the south merge with those of 'Asir and Najd. Also, not all speakers of these bedouin dialects are figuratively nomadic bedouins; some are simply sedentary sections that live in rural areas, and thus speak dialects similar to those of their bedouin neighbors.\n\nThe dialect of Al-`Ula governorate in the northern part of the Madinah region. Although understudied, it is considered to be unique among the Hejazi dialects, it is known for its pronunciation of Classical Arabic as a (e.g. becomes ), the dialect also shows a tendency to pronounce long as (e.g. Classical becomes [meːʔ]), in some instances the Classical becomes a as in becomes , also the second person singular feminine pronoun tends to be pronounced as /iʃ/ (e.g. ('your foot') becomes .\n\nThe dialect of Badr governorate in the western part of the Madinah region is mainly noted for its lengthening of word-final syllables and its alternative pronunciation of some phonemes as in which is pronounced as , it also shares some features with the general urban dialect in which modern standard Arabic is pronounced , another unique feature of the dialect is its similarity to the Arabic dialects of Bahrain.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the founder \"Molla Nasraddin\", a satirical magazine that would greatly influence the genre in the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\nMammadguluzadeh is considered to be one of the first feminists in Azerbaijan and Middle East and had a big role in founding the first women's magazine in Azerbaijan.\n\nMammadguluzadeh was born in Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan. Mammadguluzadeh considered himself to be Iranian, and was proud of the fact that his ancestors hailed from Iran. In 1887, he graduated from the Gori Pedagogical Seminary and for the next ten years was involved in teaching at rural schools in Bash-Norashen, Ulukhanli, Nehram and other towns and villages of the Erivan Governorate.\n\nMammadguluzadeh was a strong activist of the language unification movement. He condemned many of his contemporaries for what he considered a corruption of the Azeri language by replacing its genuine vocabulary with newly introduced Russian, Persian and Ottoman Turkish loanwords, often alien and confusing to many readers. Later he became deeply involved in the process of Romanization of the Azeri alphabet.\n\nIn 1898, he moved to Erivan; in 1903, he moved to Tiflis where he became a columnist for the local \"Sharqi-Rus\" newspaper published in the Azeri language. In 1906, he founded a satirical magazine entitled \"Molla Nasraddin\". Frequent military conflicts and overall political instability in the Caucasus forced him to move to Tabriz, Persia, where he continued his career as a chief-editor and columnist for \"Molla Nasraddin\". He eventually settled in Baku in 1921.\n\nMammadguluzadeh is considered to be one of first feminists in Azerbaijan and Middle East and had a big role in founding the first women's magazine in Azerbaijan.\n\nIn 1905, Mammadguluzadeh and his companions purchased a printing-house in Tiflis, and in 1906 he became the editor of the new \"Molla Nasraddin\" illustrated satirical magazine.\n\nThe magazine accurately portrayed social and economic realities of the early-20th century society and backward norms and practices common in the Caucasus. In 1921 (after \"Molla Nasraddin\" was banned in Russia in 1917), Mammadguluzadeh published eight more issues of the magazine in Tabriz, Persia. After Sovietization, the printing-house was moved to Baku, where \"Molla Nasraddin\" was published until 1931. Mammadguluzadeh's satirical style influenced the development of this genre in the Middle East. Writers of the first satirical magazines in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were influenced by Jalil Mammadguluzadeh and \"Molla Nasraddin\"\n\nIn 1907, the twice-widowed Mammadguluzadeh married Azerbaijani philanthropist and feminist-activist Hamida Javanshir. He died in Baku in 1932, aged 65.\n\nMammadguluzadeh wrote in various genres, including short stories, novels, essays, and dramatics. His first significant short story, \"The Disappearance of the Donkey\" (part of his \"Stories from the village of Danabash\" series), written in 1894 and published in 1934, touched upon social inequality. In his later works (\"The Postbox\", \"The Iranian Constitution\", \"Gurban Ali bey\", \"The Lamb\", etc.), as well as in his famous comedies \"The Corpses\" and \"The Madmen Gathering\" he ridiculed corruption, snobbery, ignorance, religious fanaticism, etc.\n\nMammadguluzadeh's religious views have been disputed. Some sources claim he was an atheist while others claim he supported Muslim democracy while being critical of extremism and ignorance. Due to his harsh criticism of religion he was sometimes threatened with death by extremists.\n\nA drama theatre in Nakhchivan, a street in Baku, the city of Jalilabad (formerly Astrakhan-Bazaar) and the town of Jalilkand (former Bash-Norashen) were all named for him.\n\n"}

Unlike Dominant/submissive structures found in BDSM in which love is often the core value, service and obedience are often the core values in Master/slave structures. The participants may be of any gender or sexual orientation. The relationship uses the term \"slave\" because of the association of the term with ownership rights of a master to their slave's body, as property or chattel. While male \"masters\" will usually be referred to as \"Master\", whether or not female Masters are referred to as \"Master\" or \"Mistress\" may depend upon whether they identify as following the leather subculture or BDSM path, or simply preference.\nSexual slavery in a BDSM context is both a sexual fantasy and sexual roleplay. The slave master or mistress might be any person or group, though the majority of such relationships are usually either one dominant, or a committed dominant couple, owning one or more slaves. A sex slave and the owner, and others involved in the relationship, can be of any gender, sexual identity, or orientation.\n\nThe Master/slave (or Owner/property) relationship is entered into on a consensual basis, without the legal force of historical or modern non-consensual slavery, that is forbidden by the laws of most countries.\n\nThe term \"sex slave\" is used rather than just \"slave\" because sex is not a necessary component of consensual slavery. In BDSM, a slave is a specific type of submissive. Not all submissives are slaves, though all slaves would normally be considered submissive in the relationship.\nHowever some calling themselves 'slave' may only be submissive within a sexual context/activity whilst others are also submissive within other or all aspects of the relationship, 'sex-slave' or 'slave' respectively.\n\nOutside the BDSM community, the relationship of Master/slave is sometimes regarded as a form of consensual sexual slavery. In BDSM, a slave is a specific type of submissive. The Master/slave relationship refers to the relationship between the individuals involved, and does not necessarily require any specific acts, sexual or otherwise, though sexual activity is usually an aspect of the relationship. The sexual aspect could be conventional, and not necessarily BDSM. A slave could also be a masochist or bottom, but this is not always the case.\n\nSome participants regard the relationship as sexual roleplay, while others enter into the relationship on the basis of a highly committed, long-term, submissive lifestyle.\n\nVarious forms of symbolism are sometimes used to affirm the owner/slave relationship. These include wearing the owner's collar, being registered in a slave register, adopting (sometimes legally changing to) a name chosen by the owner, or engaging in a public declaration or ritualized ceremony of some type.\n\nSome people draw up a slave contract that defines the relationship in explicit detail. These contracts may also deal with domestic arrangements (such as cleanliness, home duties) and interpersonal relationship matters (such as issues of deference, language, etc.), besides the sexual arrangements. Typically, they would provide that the Master has the exclusive authority in all matters relating to the body and behavior of the slave, including underwear and other clothing, social relations outside of the arrangement, etc. Although such contracts are not enforceable in the ways legal contracts are, they can be useful for defining in written form the limits of the arrangement between the signatories, and for documenting the consensuality of the relationships they define between them.\n\nIn some traditional rituals, after signing a slave contract, the commitment to the relationship is celebrated by a collaring ceremony, which can be simple or elaborate, often witnessed by invited friends. The slave then wears a collar to publicly declare the slave's subjugation and the Master's ownership. Such a collar may be a piece of neckwear, or may be a bracelet or other piece of jewelery that symbolizes slave status. Such a collar is generally not removed except for practical reasons such as medical or security requirements, unless or until the relationship is dissolved; however, a slave is sometimes permitted to wear a more subdued (or less obtrusive) one outside of the home — for example during work or in social situations with people who may otherwise feel uncomfortable.\n\nSlave training is a BDSM activity usually involving a consensual power exchange between two people taking on the roles of a Master or Mistress and a slave. The objective is to change the slave's behavior in a manner that is pleasing to the Master or Mistress, for example to train the slave to follow a set of rules or commands that the Master or Mistress has provided.\n\nSome Masters adopt a holistic approach to the maintenance and long-term development of their slave by using such models as Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\n\nDepending on the relationship, one or more lesson plans may also involve some forms of aversion training. This could include use of spanking, physical restraints, or clamping to encourage compliance, and to provide the slave with a specific reason to comply. If the trainee is also a masochist, the aversion to physical pain may be lacking, in which case psychological or emotional discomfort may be employed to create the unpleasant result that punishment requires.\n\nSexual slavery is a consensual exchange of power by the submissive to the dominant, though the scope of the surrender of discretion may be limited and may be withdrawn at any time.\n\nThe types of activities that the sex slave may be expected to perform are usually defined in advance and sometimes spelled out in a slave contract, a document without real value that outlines the desires, limits, and expectations of the parties. The sex slave is often expected to perform sexually, though typically many relationship-oriented dynamics are also clearly negotiated, including clothing, diet, speech restrictions, household affairs and schedules, though the details may be left to the master or mistress. Typically outlined are clear expectations of whether the couple will be monogamous or polyamorous, and if there would be permission or expectation of sexual interaction with other people. Otherwise, a sex slave may be expected to perform many of the same functions that are expected of a slave/submissive, including wearing very revealing clothes, being shared, wearing a slave collar or leash, S&M activities, or bondage.\n\nA Master & slave \"relationship\" is normally a long-term relationship, comparable in duration to normal relationships whereas a Dominant - submissive \"relationship\" could be of a similar duration or shorter from a few minutes, as in a scene. Depending on their contract, a sex slave may be traded by the master, facilitated by sex club events, personals in BDSM interest magazines or internet based social networks. Commonly, a slave is also said to be a collared slave, though not every slave wears a physical slave collar.\n\nA slave who has satisfied the duration of the negotiated time of service is expected to be released, unless a new duration of service is negotiated. A slave may at any time withdraw consent to the relationship, effectively nullifying the slave relationship.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5744936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5744936", "title": "Modern Hebrew verb conjugation", "text": "Modern Hebrew verb conjugation\n\nIn Hebrew, verbs, which take the form of derived stems, are conjugated to reflect their tense and mood, as well as to agree with their subjects in gender, number, and person. Each verb has an inherent voice, though a verb in one voice typically has counterparts in other voices. This article deals mostly with Modern Hebrew, but to some extent, the information shown here applies to Biblical Hebrew as well.\n\nVerbs in Hebrew, like nouns, adjectives, and adverbs are formed and declined by altering a (usually) three letter root. However, the root can be identified as having a different pattern than normal in certain cases.\n\nA root that contains at least one of the \"weak\" letters alef, hey, vav, het, yod, nun, and 'ayin or two of the same consonant (geminates) is called a \"weak\" root. Each pairing of a weak letter with a position results in a slightly different conjugation pattern. Resh ר is often considered a weak letter, though it occasionally functions as a strong letter, depending on speaker and era of the language. Roots without weak letters are called \"strong\" roots, among other names.\n\nA root that contains het, hey (except in third position without mappiq), or 'ayin or alef (in first position only) is a \"guttural root\". The pattern changes from this group are largely due to all of these letters being unable to take schwa nah. Alef outside of first position is in its own group due to the vowel changes that accompany it being drastically different than other guttural roots. A root that contains hey word-finally without mappiq is also similarly divergent from guttural roots, due to being a marker of vowel-final words rather than any historical consonant.\n\nA root that contains a vav or a yod as the first or second letter is called a \"hollow root\", as the simple (pa'al and nif'al) conjugation function as two-letter roots, while the other conjugations keep the letters somewhat due to the middle root being geminated. A root beginning with yod usually marks a waw-initial root (due to Old Hebrew becoming at the beginning of words), but occasionally functions as if it a regular yod root.\n\nA root containing nun is irregular due to the fact it will form geminated consonants rather than clusters of it. Roots containing two of the same consonant as the second and third part of the root function similarly.\n\nRoots of four or more letters treat the middle letters as a permanent cluster and don't have forms in the simple conjugations pa'al and nif'al, but are regular otherwise.\n\nThere are also entirely irregular verbs like הָיָה (\"to be\"), and הָלַךְ (\"to walk\"), which are unusual beyond their bearing of weak letters.\n\nHebrew verbs are conjugated according to specific patterns, derived stems, called בִּנְיָנִים ( – \"binyanim\", \"constructions\") where vowels patterns and affixes are slotted into the (usually) three-letter שרשים ( – \"shorashim\", \"roots\") from which the majority of Hebrew words are built.\n\nThere are seven basic conjugations and a very rare eighth \"hitpu'al\", as well as some irregular verbs technically pa'al, nif'al or pi'el being used irregularly without necessarily a weak root (due to being descendants of obsolete conjugation or confluence between multiple conjugations). The traditional demonstration root is , which has the basic meaning of \"action\" or \"doing\":\nThis simplified chart's menorah-like shape is sometimes invoked in teaching the binyanim to help students remember the main ideas about the binyanim: (1) which binyanim are active voice (left side) vs. passive voice (right side), and (2) which binyanim are simple (outer-most menorah branches), intensive (second-outer-most), causative (third-outer-most), and reflexive (center). Note that some binyanim have more than one meaning.\n\nExamples:\n\nAs mentioned, some binyanim have more than one meaning. For example, הִפְעִיל 's second most common meaning is \"become\". Verbs like \"became fat\" (הִשְׁמִין ) and \"turned pale\" (הֶחְוִיר ) are in this binyan. This meaning of הִפְעִיל is similar to that of the Arabic ninth derived stem, افعلّ , while הִפְעִיל 's main meaning is shared with its Arabic historical equivalent, the fourth derived stem, أفعل .\n\nA verb in the present tense ( ) agrees with its subject in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural), so each verb has four present-tense forms:\nThe present tense does not inflect by first, second, or third person because its use as a present tense is a relatively recent trend, as this form was originally used only as the participle. The modern present tense verb is \"still\" used as the present participle; see below.\n\nThe ancient language did not have strictly defined past, present, or future tenses, but merely perfective and imperfective aspects, with past, present, or future connotation depending on context. Later the perfective and imperfective aspects were explicitly refashioned as the past and future tenses respectively, with the participle standing in as the present tense. (This also happened to the Aramaic language around the same time, but did not happen in Arabic, where the present and future tenses still share the same morphology, the one equivalent to the Hebrew future tense. The future tense is distinguished from the present tense by the use of prefixes.)\n\nA verb in the past tense ( ) agrees with its subject in person (first, second, or third) and number, and in the second-person singular and plural and third-person singular, gender.\n\nNote that the past/perfect and the present/participle inflections of the third-person singular nif'al were historically pronounced with different vowels in the final syllable—the past/perfect with a (   = ), and the present/participle with a (   = ). In Modern Hebrew, both of these vowels have merged to , and the two verb forms now are pronounced the same. For example, the past tense means \"he was guarded\" (or in old-fashioned perfective \"he is/was guarded\"), whereas the present tense means \"he is being guarded\".\n\nA verb in the future tense ( ) agrees with its subject in person and number, and in the second- and third-person singular, gender. The second-person singular masculine and third-person singular feminine forms are identical for all verbs in the future tense. Historically, there have been separate feminine forms for the second- and third-person plural (shown in parentheses on the table). These are still occasionally used today (most often in formal settings), and could be seen as the 'correct' forms. However, in everyday speech, most Israelis use the historically male form for both genders.\n\nAs in the past tense, personal pronouns are not strictly necessary in the future tense, as the verb forms are sufficient to identify the subject, but they are frequently used.\n\nExcept for the strictly passive binyaním ( and ), each binyan has distinct imperative forms in the second person. This imperative form is only used for affirmative commands. The pa'al, nif'al, pi'el and hif'il form their imperatives by dropping the initial ת taw of the future-tense form (e.g., (singular, masc.) → \"open!\", (singular, fem.) → \"guard!\"); the fifth, hitpa'el, forms its imperative by replacing this initial with ( → \"do nothing!\"). (Note that the dropping of the initial ת often results in a change in vocalization, as can be seen in the instance of vs. ).\n\nNegative commands use the particle followed by the future-tense form. For example, means \"don't worry\" (masculine, singular).\n\nIn informal speech, the future tense is commonly used for affirmative commands when making requests. Thus for example, can mean either \"you will open\" or \"would you open\" (masculine, singular). (Similarly in English one might say \"would you open\" or \"could you open\" in lieu of simply \"open\".) In Hebrew, as in English, the more formal way to avoid the implication of commanding is to use the word \"please\" ( ) with the imperative.\n\nThe infinitive can be used as a \"general imperative\" when addressing nobody in particular (e.g., on signs, or when giving general instructions to children or large groups), so that for example, means \"please do not open\". This might be more literally rendered as \"it is requested that [this] not be opened\", avoiding the question of address by using a passive voice.\n\nPresent participles are identical to present tense forms (the modern present tense actually having been derived from the ancient present participle): (burning candles), (charming girl).\n\nOnly the pa'al binyan has a true past participle: from k-t-b we have , (writ, written). For verbs that have a pa'al form and a nif'al form serving as its passive, this provides a means to distinguish between a completed and a continuing action. The pa'al past participle indicates completion:\n\n\nwhile the present tense of nif'al indicates that the action continues:\n\n\nThe passive participle is commonly used as an adjective, as in (the written order).\n\nThe present tense of the pu'al and huf'al are used as passive participles for the pi'el and hif'il respectively. For example, from hif'il (lit) we get (lit room).\n\nInfinitives () in Hebrew are primarily formed by adding the letter lamed (ל) to the front of the base form (). The vowels change systematically according to the binyan.\n\n\nNote that and verbs do not have infinitives.\n\nGerunds () are nouns expressing an action. Gerunds are created in Hebrew by putting the root of a verb into a , a noun pattern (\"see\" Modern Hebrew grammar#Noun derivation). Five of the binyanim have gerunds: , , , , and . For example:\n\n\nNote that unlike in English (where gerunds and present participles share the same form but different etymology), Hebrew gerunds cannot be used as adjectives.\n\nModern Hebrew has an analytic conditional~past-habitual mood expressed with the auxiliary :\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated from college in 1885 with a Bachelors in Arts degree majoring in Ethics and Logic.\n\nM.S. Puttanna began his career in Kolar High School in 1878 teaching literature. He was granted a transfer to his alma mater, Raja School Mysore, where he resumed teaching. While teaching at the Raja School he enrolled in classes towards his BA in Ethics and Logic.\n\nAfter graduating from college in 1885, he left his teaching post and took a job as a court translator in the Chief Court of the Kingdom of Mysore, known today as the High Court of Mysore, translating legal documents from English to Kannada and vice versa. He held this job until 1897.\n\nIn 1897 he was appointed to be the Amildar(administrator of a group of villages) in the Taluk of Chitradurga, Kingdom of Mysore. He later served in the capacity of Amildar in the Mysore Taluks of Nelamangala, Chamrajnagar, Bagepalli, Mulabagal and Hosadurga.\n\nWhile serving as Amildar and advocate, M.S. Puttanna began his literary career around the end of the 19th century. M.S. Puttanna authored 29 works of Kannada literature. His works are associated with the two prominent phases of Kannada literature. One was 'Arunodaya' (pre-renaissance) and the other, 'Navodaya' (renaissance) which overlapped in his lifetime. In addition to his commitment to full-time authorship, he served as editor and contributing author to a monthly literary journal called 'Hitha Bodhini' which loosely translates to 'Teaching the Good' or 'Wise Counsel’.\n\nIn Kannada literature he is known to be one of the pioneers of the use of colloquial or common language, effectively broadening the appeal of the language to a wider readership. He was the first Kannada author to record in a biography, the life of a local Kannadiga personage, Kunigal Rama Sastry. He was also the first to translate the works of Thomas Day and William Shakespeare from English to Kannada. He translated 'The Adventures of Hatim Tai' by Duncan Forbes (originally written in 1824). Together with his friend H.V. Nanjundaiah, M.S. Puttanna worked for the founding of the Kannada Sahitya Sammelana (Kannada Literary Institute) in Chamrajpet, Bangalore and served as its first secretary.\n\nBased on his prior experience as Amildar, he worked as a secretary for the ‘Ratepayers Association’ (equivalent of today's Tax Revenue Board) preparing reports and chairing meetings held in Kannada. He also supported equal rights for all in the Kingdom of Mysore and demonstrated this by personally honoring a select group of soldiers from all castes at his home in Basavanagudi, Bangalore (where a street is named for him) on their return from action in Europe after the Great War.\n\nM.S. Puttanna died at age 76 in Bangalore, Kingdom of Mysore in 1930.\n\n"}

{"id": "235463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235463", "title": "Skyway", "text": "Skyway\n\nA skyway, skybridge, or skywalk is a type of pedway consisting of an enclosed or covered footbridge between two or more buildings in an urban area. This protects pedestrians from the weather. In North America skyways are usually owned by businesses, and are therefore not public spaces (compare with sidewalk). However, in Asia, such as Bangkok's and Hong Kong's skywalks, they are built and owned separately by the city government, connecting between privately run rail stations or other transport with their own footbridges, and run many kilometers. Skyways usually connect on the first few floors above the ground-level floor, though they are sometimes much higher, as in Petronas Towers. The space in the buildings connected by skyways is often devoted to retail business, so areas around the skyway may operate as a shopping mall. Non-commercial areas with closely associated buildings, such as university campuses, can often have skyways and/or tunnels connecting buildings.\n\nThe world's largest discontinuous skyway network – Calgary, Canada's \"+15 Walkway\" system – has a total length of . The Minneapolis Skyway System is the world's largest continuous system and spans connecting 80 blocks in downtown Minneapolis.\n\nOn a smaller scale, terminals of large airports are often connected by skywalk systems, as at Manchester Airport, United Kingdom; in many airports, retractable jet bridges provide a direct connection between airplanes and terminals.\n\nSome cities have the equivalent of a skyway underground, and there are also mixed subway/skyway systems; see underground city.\n\n\nBesides pedestrian safety and convenience, the chief reasons assigned by urban planners for skywalk development are decrease of traffic congestion, reduction in vehicular air pollution and separation of people from vehicular noise. A number of cities (for example, Spokane, Washington) have given intricate analysis to skywalk systems employing computer models to optimize skywalk layout.\n\nThere is debate about the negative impact on urban areas of skyways. Robertson (1988) noted the negative impacts to street activities, and reductions to the property value at ground level. Woo (2012) found that skywalk systems could be negatively associated with promoting consumerism. Cui (2015) called for more research into the impact of skyways in developing countries.\n\nThere are significant skyway networks in many cities in the US Midwest, such as Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Rochester, and Duluth. Most networks in North America are privately owned. A notable exception in are the Saint Paul skyways, which are publicly owned.\nIn Bangkok, Thailand there are more than 5.4 km of covered wide dedicated elevated skywalks with lighting. These were developed due to lack of proper sidewalks as well as street hawkers and local merchants taking advantage of any sidewalk space as makeshift commercial real estate. Common reasons skywalks were built include to avoid street pollution, dust, wetness from food vendors and/or rain, potholes, long queues, crowds, and uneven pavement, supporting urbanism but probably most importantly, tourism receipts. Most skywalks connect to a BTS station and utilize space underneath the rail line and BTS pillar supports. These skywalks have connector ramps which connect stations to malls seamlessly and are paid for by the malls themselves, otherwise the city and BTS fund walkway development. A 50km long extension project was shelved in 2011 due to funding issues, nevertheless the system is growing organically.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there are numerous foot bridge networks across the city. Particularly large networks exists around elevated or at grade MTR stations and connections between malls and housing estates in new town centers. The largest network spans Admiralty, Central and parts of Sheung Wan districts in the CBD and consists of the Central Elevated and Central–Mid-Levels Walkway systems which link up over 40 major office buildings. The Central–Mid-Levels walkway system is the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world according to Guinness World Records. Other large systems exist in Tsuen Wan and Mong Kok.\n\nThe Mumbai Skywalk Project is a planned discontinuous network of over 50 km of skywalks in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, India. The skyways will connect Mumbai Suburban Railway stations to important junctions, each 1 to 2 km in length. The first of these is a 1.3 km (0.8 mi) long skywalk connecting the suburban regions of Bandra and Kurla.\n\nAdditionally, short skyways are used to connect buildings in other locations. This includes a skywalk, 170 m above the ground and 58 m long between the two Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between the two towers on 41st and 42nd floors, world's highest 2-story bridge. \n\nBrussels, Belgium has a skyway between the two Belgacom Towers.\n\nLondon has skywalks on the Barbican Estate and London Wall. The City of London Pedway Scheme was devised as part of the post World War II reconstruction plans for London, it was put into effect mainly from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s and eventually abandoned by the 1980s.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2949311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2949311", "title": "Speaking tube", "text": "Speaking tube\n\nA speaking tube or voicepipe is a device based on two cones connected by an air pipe through which speech can be transmitted over an extended distance. While its most common use was in intra-ship communications, the principle was also used in affluent homes and offices of the 19th century, as well as expensive automobiles, military aircraft, and even locomotives. For most purposes, the device was outmoded by the telephone and its widespread adoption. \n\nEarly voicepipes consisted of two cones, of wood or metal, one end shaped to fit the speaker's mouth, connected to the other which was flared to amplify the sound (specifically to match the impedance of the tube to that of the open room). Later designs of the voicepipe inserted a removable cork-mounted whistle, which could be sounded by blowing into the tube from the other end. On naval vessels, this created a distinctive sound associated with urgent intra-ship communication on old warships. The sound of the whistle would summon the listener, who would remove the whistle and answer the call.\n\nVoice pipes could be used over distances as long as . However, very long speaking tubes might use an electrical signalling device to indicate a call, as the large volume of air in the pipe would make it difficult to blow with enough pressure to sound a whistle at the far end. Despite this, a pipe with a larger internal diameter was desirable for longer runs as the signal loss is inversely proportional to the pipe's cross-sectional area.\n\nVoicepipes have no switching mechanism and so, to provide multiple destinations, separate voicepipes with dedicated transit pipes have to be provided between all pairs of desired endpoints.\n\nThe technology continues to be used into the electronic age due to its reliability and low cost. Voice pipes are unaffected by a complete electrical power loss or by an electromagnetic pulse. Warships built as late as the 1950s continued to incorporate voicepipes alongside more advanced technology.\n\nVoice pipes, the maritime term, served to transmit reports from lookout positions aloft to the deck and from the bridge to the steering position and engine room. These were somewhat larger in diameter than the domestic version and were often covered in sound absorbent material to increase their efficiency.\n\nCopper voice pipes were being fitted to British two and three-deck warships as early as 1803. A notable use was on board HMS \"Victory\" at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. \"Victory's\" ship's wheel was shot away early in the battle. A voice tube was then used to carry steering orders from the quarterdeck down three decks, to where a gang of sailors operated the ship's tiller directly using ropes and pulleys.\n\nOne disadvantage of voice pipes is that they may breach the integrity of watertight spaces. This led to the introduction of shut-off valves on both ends of voicepipes to prevent water from a flooded compartment from entering other compartments via its voicepipes.\n\nPermanently fitted, rigid voice pipes are still in use and are generally covered with heavy lids to avoid ingress of water. The speaker has to place his mouth in the \"horn\" or bell-shaped end of the pipe and the receiver has to 'bend an ear' to hear what is being said.\n\nVoice pipes have generally been replaced by sound powered telephones. The speaking tubes on naval ships are used when they are in \"clam\" mode instead of telephones for electronic stealth.\n\nIn domestic applications, voicepipes were smaller and referred to as \"speaking tubes\". The ends of the tube were often flexible for convenience of use. The speaking tube supplemented the array of remotely controlled hand bells that were operated in the upstairs rooms and rang in the servant's quarters in even modest houses in the 19th century. The phrase \"get on the horn\" and \"give him a blow\" as well as the use of \"blower\" as a synonym for \"telephone\" are generally accepted as having their origin in this feature of speaking tubes.\n\nSpeaking tubes were employed in some offices, with whistles at either end and were therefore also known as whistling tubes. Several speaking tubes could be hung from the edge of a desk to communicate with different locations.\n\nSpeaking tubes were also used in fine automobiles such as the 1927 Rolls Royce Phantom, allowing communication between the separate passenger and driver's compartments when desired.\n\nA 'Gosport Tube' was a voice tube used by flight instructors in the early days of military aviation to give instructions and directions to their students. It was invented by flying instructor Robert Raymond Smith-Barry at the School of Special Flying he opened at Gosport in 1917.\n\nAcoustic tube headphones (also called pneumatic earphones or air earphones) are used especially in two-way radio. These are useful because a clear tube can be used to hide the earphones. They are also sometimes used for the microphone on telephonists headsets and to provide music to patients undergoing an MRI scan, as it would be dangerous to use metal wiring in the scanner's magnetic field.\n\nIn Europe, they were installed on the wards of hospitals for a time where the patient's 'radio' was built into the nurse call and lighting control unit. This unit contains an electromagnetic conventional speaker but from there to the patients ears was by tube - presumably so that the part contacting the patient could be easily cleaned. These systems are still in use.\n\nPneumatic intercoms can be applied to motorcycle helmets for pilot-passenger communication. Similar systems are common on ultralight aviation too. They are sometimes preferred over bluetooth or other radio technologies due to their simplicity and absence of batteries.\n\nUp to the 2000s acoustic tubes were in use in some civil aircraft for movies, audio and other audio broadcasting in-flight entertainments.\n\nThe principle of the speaking tube can be found on certain playground equipment, which employs tubing connecting sound horns or other speaking boxes to allow voices to travel to separate points, for the amusement of the children.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "477804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477804", "title": "Sublimation (psychology)", "text": "Sublimation (psychology)\n\nIn psychology, sublimation is a of defense mechanism, in which socially unacceptable impulses or idealizations are transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior, possibly resulting in a long-term conversion of the initial impulse.\n\nSigmund Freud believed that sublimation was a sign of maturity and civilization, allowing people to function normally in culturally acceptable ways. He defined sublimation as the process of deflecting sexual instincts into acts of higher social valuation, being \"an especially conspicuous feature of cultural development; it is what makes it possible for higher psychical activities, scientific, artistic or ideological, to play such an \"important\" part in civilized life\". Wade and Travis present a similar view, stating that sublimation is when displacement \"serves a higher cultural or socially useful purpose, as in the creation of art or inventions\".\n\n In the opening section of \"Human, All Too Human\" entitled 'Of first and last things', Nietzsche wrote:\nThere is, strictly speaking, neither unselfish conduct, nor a wholly disinterested point of view. Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest observation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in the present state of development of the sciences, is a chemistry of the moral, religious, aesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those emotions which we experience in the affairs, great and small, of society and civilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude. But what if this chemistry established the fact that, even in its domain, the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most despised ingredients? Would many feel disposed to continue such investigations? Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and beginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the opposite course?\nIn Freud's psychoanalytical theory, erotic energy is allowed a limited amount of expression, owing to the constraints of human society and civilization itself. It therefore requires other outlets, especially if an individual is to remain psychologically balanced.\n\nSublimation () is the process of transforming libido into \"socially useful\" achievements, including artistic, cultural and intellectual pursuits. Freud considered this psychical operation to be fairly salutary compared to the others that he identified, such as repression, displacement, denial, reaction formation, intellectualisation, and projection. In \"The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence\" (1936), his daughter, Anna, classed sublimation as one of the major 'defence mechanisms' of the psyche.\n\nFreud got the idea of sublimation while reading \"The Harz Journey\" by Heinrich Heine. The story is about Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach who cut off the tails of dogs he encountered in childhood and later became a surgeon. Freud concluded that sublimation could be observed in an action performed many times throughout one's life, which firstly appears sadistic, though is ultimately refined into an activity which is of benefit to mankind.\n\nHarry Stack Sullivan, the pioneer of interpersonal psychoanalysis, defined sublimation as the unwitting substitution of a partial satisfaction with social approval for the pursuit of a direct satisfaction which would be contrary to one's ideals or to the judgment of social censors and other important people who surround one. The substitution might not be quite what we want, but it is the only way that we can get part of our satisfaction and feel secure, too. Sullivan documented that all sublimatory things are more complicated than the direct satisfaction of the needs to which they apply. They entail no disturbance of consciousness, no stopping to think why they must be done or what the expense connected with direct satisfaction would be. In successful sublimation, Sullivan observed extraordinarily efficient handling of a conflict between the need for a satisfaction and the need for security without perturbation of awareness.\n\nSexual sublimation, also known as sexual transmutation, is the act, especially among some religious traditions, to transform sexual impulses or \"sexual energy\" into creative energy. In this context, sublimation is the transference of sexual energy, or libido, into a physical act or a different emotion in order to avoid confrontation with the sexual urge, which is itself contrary to the individual's belief or ascribed religious belief. It is based on the idea that \"sexual energy\" can be used to create a spiritual nature which in turn can create more sensual works, instead of one's sexuality being unleashed \"raw\". The classical example in Western religions is clerical celibacy.\n\nAs espoused in the Tanya, Hasidic Jewish mysticism views sublimation of the animal soul as an essential task in life, wherein the goal is to transform animalistic and earthy cravings for physical pleasure into holy desires to connect with God.\n\nDifferent schools of thought describe general sexual urges as carriers of spiritual essence, and have the varied names of vital energy, vital winds (prana), spiritual energy, ojas, shakti, tummo, or kundalini. It is also believed that undergoing sexual sublimation can facilitate a mystical awakening in an individual.\n\nC. G. Jung believed sublimation to be mystical in nature, thus differing fundamentally from Freud's view of the concept. For Freud, sublimation helped explain the plasticity of the sexual instincts (and their convertibility to non-sexual ends). The concept also underpinned his psychoanalytical theories, which showed the human psyche at the mercy of conflicting impulses (such as the super-ego and the id). Jung criticized Freud for obscuring the alchemical origins of sublimation and for attempting instead to make the concept appear scientifically credible:\n\nThis criticism extends from the private sphere of his correspondence (as above) to specific papers he published on psychoanalysis:\n\nLacan's exposition of sublimation is framed within a discussion about the relationship of psychoanalysis and ethics within the seventh book of his seminars. Lacanian sublimation is defined with reference to the concept \"Das Ding\" (later in his career Lacan termed this \"objet petit a\"); \"Das Ding\" is German for 'the thing' though Lacan conceives it as an abstract notion and one of the defining characteristics of the human condition. Broadly speaking it is the vacuum one experiences as a human being and which one endeavours to fill with differing human relationships, objects and experiences all of which serve to plug a gap in one's psychical needs. For this reason Lacan also considers \"Das Ding\" to be a non-Thing or vacuole. The relationships which one relies on to overcome the vacuity of \"Das Ding\" are always insufficient in wholly satisfying the individual.\n\nLacan considers \"Das Ding\" a lost object ever in the process of being recuperated by Man. Temporarily the individual will be duped by his or her own psyche into believing that this object, this person or this circumstance can be relied upon to satisfy his needs in a stable and enduring manner when in fact 'it is in its nature that the object as such is lost. It will never be found again. Something is there while one waits for something better, or worse, but which one wants' and again '[Das Ding] is to be found at the most as something missed. One doesn't find it, but only its pleasurable associations.' Human life unravels as a series of detours in the quest for the lost object or the absolute Other of the individual: 'The pleasure principle governs the search for the object and imposes detours which maintain the distance to \"Das Ding\" in relation to its end.'\n\nLacanian sublimation centres to a large part on the notion of \"Das Ding\". His general formula for sublimation is that 'it raises an object ... to the dignity of The Thing. Lacan considers these objects (whether human, aesthetic, credal or philosophical) to be signifiers which are representative of \"Das Ding\" and that 'the function of the pleasure principle is, in effect, to lead the subject from signifier to signifier, by generating as many signifiers as are required to maintain at as low a level as possible the tension that regulates the whole functioning of the psychic apparatus.' Furthermore, man is the 'artisan of his support system', in other words, he creates or finds the signifiers which delude him into believing he has overcome the emptiness of \"Das Ding\".\n\nLacan also considers sublimation to be process of creation \"ex nihilo\" (creating out of nothing), whereby an object, human or manufactured, comes to be defined in relation to the emptiness of \"Das Ding\". Lacan's prime example of this is the courtly love of the troubadours and \"Minnesänger\" who dedicated their poetic verse to a love-object which was not only unreachable (and therefore experienced as something missing) but whose existence and desirability also centred around a hole (the vagina). For Lacan such courtly love was 'a paradigm of sublimation'. He affirms that the word 'troubadour' is etymologically linked to the Provençal verb \"trobar\" (like the French \"trouver\") 'to find.' If we consider again the definition of \"Das Ding\", it is dependent precisely on the expectation of the subject to re-find the lost object in the mistaken belief that it will continue to satisfy him (or her).\n\nLacan maintains that creation \"ex nihilo\" operates in other noteworthy fields as well. In pottery for example vases are created around an empty space. They are primitive and even primordial artefacts which have benefited mankind not only in the capacity of utensils but also as metaphors of (cosmic) creation \"ex nihilo\". Lacan cites Heidegger who situates the vase between the earthly (raising clay from the ground) and the ethereal (pointing upwards to receive). In architecture, Lacan asserts, buildings are designed around an empty space and in art paintings proceed from an empty canvas, and often depict empty spaces through perspective.\n\nIn myth, Pan pursues the nymph Syrinx who is transformed into hollow reeds in order to avoid the clutches of the God, who subsequently cuts the reeds down in anger and transforms them into what we today call panpipes (both reeds and panpipes rely on their hollowness for the production of sound).\n\nLacan briefly remarks that religion and science are also based around emptiness. In regard to religion, Lacan refers the reader to Freud, stating that much obsessional religious behaviour can be attributed to the avoidance of the primordial emptiness of \"Das Ding\" or in the respecting of it. As for the discourse of science this is based on the notion of \"Verwerfung\" (the German word for 'dismissal') which results in the dismissing, foreclosing or exclusion of the notion of \"Das Ding\" presumably because it defies empirical categorisation.\n\nA study by Kim, Zeppenfeld, and Cohen studied sublimation by empirical methods.\nThese investigators view their research, published in the \"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology\", as providing \"possibly the first experimental evidence for sublimation and [suggesting] a cultural psychological approach to defense mechanisms\".\n\n"}
{"id": "45158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45158", "title": "Tatian", "text": "Tatian\n\nTatian of Adiabene, or Tatian the Syrian, Tatian the Assyrian,\n(; ; ; ; c. 120 – c. 180 AD) was a Syrian Christian writer and theologian of the 2nd century.\n\nTatian's most influential work is the Diatessaron, a Biblical paraphrase, or \"harmony\", of the four gospels that became the standard text of the four gospels in the Syriac-speaking churches until the 5th-century, after which it gave way to the four separate gospels in the Peshitta version.\n\nConcerning the date and place of his birth, little is known beyond what Tatian tells about himself in his \"Oratio ad Graecos\", chap. xlii (\"Ante-Nicene Fathers\", ii. 81–82): that he was born in \"the land of the Assyrians\"; (referring to Syria) Tatian was not born in geographical Assyria (Mesopotamia), he was born to the west of the Euphrates (Syria) scholarly consensus is that he died c. 185 AD, perhaps in Adiabene.\n\nHe traveled to Rome, where he first encountered Christianity. During his prolonged stay in Rome, according to his own representation, his abhorrence of the pagan cults sparked deep reflections on religious problems. Through the Old Testament, he wrote, he grew convinced of the unreasonableness of paganism. He adopted the Christian religion and became the pupil of Justin Martyr. During this period Christian philosophers competed with Greek sophists. Like Justin, Tatian opened a Christian school in Rome.\n\nKnowledge of Tatian's life following the death of Justin in 165 AD is to some extent obscure. Irenaeus remarks (\"Haer.\", I., xxvlii. 1, \"Ante-Nicene Fathers,\" i. 353) that after the death of Justin, he was expelled from the church for his Encratitic (ascetic) views. (Eusebius claims he founded the Encratitic sect), as well as for being a follower of the gnostic leader Valentinius. It is clear that Tatian left Rome, perhaps to reside for a while in either Greece or Alexandria, where he may have taught Clement of Alexandria. Epiphanius relates that Tatian established a school in Mesopotamia, the influence of which extended to Antioch in Syria, and was felt in Cilicia and especially in Pisidia.\n\nThe early development of the Syrian church furnishes a commentary on the attitude of Tatian in practical life. Thus for Aphrahat baptism conditions the taking of a vow in which the catechumen promises celibacy. This shows how firmly the views of Tatian were established in Syria, and it supports the supposition that Tatian was the missionary of the countries around the Euphrates.\n\nHis \"Oratio ad Graecos\" (Address to the Greeks) condemns paganism as worthless, and praises the reasonableness and high antiquity of Christianity. As early as Eusebius, Tatian was praised for his discussions of the antiquity of Moses and of Jewish legislation, and it was because of this chronological section that his \"Oratio\" was not generally condemned.\n\nHis other major work was the \"Diatessaron\", a \"harmony\" or synthesis of the four New Testament Gospels into a combined narrative of the life of Jesus. Ephrem the Syrian referred to it as the \"Evangelion da Mehallete\" (\"The Gospel of the Mixed\"), and it was practically the only gospel text used in Syria during the 3rd and 4th centuries.\n\nIn the 5th century the Diatessaron was replaced in those Syrian churches that used it by the four original Gospels. Rabbula, Bishop of Edessa, ordered the priests and deacons to see that every church should have a copy of the separate Gospels (\"Evangelion da Mepharreshe\"), and Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus, removed more than two hundred copies of the \"Diatessaron\" from the churches in his diocese.\n\nA number of recensions of the \"Diatessaron\" are extant. The earliest, part of the Eastern family of recensions, is preserved in Ephrem's \"Commentary\" on Tatian's work, which itself is preserved in two versions: an Armenian translation preserved in two copies, and a copy of Ephrem's original Syriac text from the late 5th/early 6th century, which has been edited by Louis Leloir (Paris, 1966). Other translations include translations made into Arabic, Persian, and Old Georgian. A fragment of a narrative about the Passion found in the ruins of Dura-Europos in 1933 was once thought to have been from the \"Diatessaron\", but more recent scholarly judgement does not connect it directly to Tatian's work.\n\nThe earliest member of the Western family of recensions is the Latin Codex Fuldensis, written at the request of bishop Victor of Capua in 545 AD. Although the text is clearly dependent on the Vulgate, the order of the passages is distinctly how Tatian arranged them. Tatian's influence can be detected much earlier in such Latin manuscripts as the Old Latin translation of the Bible, in Novatian's surviving writings, and in the Roman Antiphony. After the Codex Fuldensis, it would appear that members of the Western family led an underground existence, popping into view over the centuries in an Old High German translation (c. 830), a Dutch (c. 1280), a Venetian manuscript of the 13th century, and a Middle English manuscript from 1400 that was once owned by Samuel Pepys.\n\nIn a lost writing entitled \"On Perfection according to the Doctrine of the Savior,\" Tatian designates matrimony as a symbol of the tying of the flesh to the perishable world and ascribed the \"invention\" of matrimony to the devil. He distinguishes between the old and the new man; the old man is the law, the new man the Gospel. Other lost writings of Tatian include a work written before the \"Oratio ad Graecos\" that contrasts the nature of man with the nature of the animals, and a \"Problematon biblion\", which aimed to present a compilation of obscure Scripture sayings.\n\nThe starting-point of Tatian's theology is a strict monotheism which becomes the source of the moral life. Originally, the human soul possessed faith in one God, but lost it with the fall.\nIn consequence, under the rule of demons, man sank into the abominable error of polytheism. By monotheistic faith, the soul is delivered from the material world and from demonic rule and is united with God. God is spirit (\"pneuma\"), but not the physical or stoical \"pneuma;\" he was alone before the creation, but he had within himself potentially the whole creation. Some scholars consider Tatian's creation theology as the beginning of teaching \"ex nihilo\" (creation from \"nothing\").\n\nThe means of creation was the \"dynamis logike\" (\"power expressed in words\"). At first there\nproceeded from God the Logos who, generated in the beginning, was to produce the world by creating matter from which the whole creation sprang. Creation is penetrated by the \"pneuma hylikon\", \"world spirit,\" which is common to angels, stars, men, animals, and plants. This world spirit is lower than the divine \"pneuma,\" and becomes in man the \"psyche\" or \"soul,\" so that on the material side and in his soul man does not differ essentially from the\nanimals; though at the same time he is called to a peculiar union with the divine spirit, which raises him above the animals. This spirit is the image of God in man, and to it man's immortality is due.\n\nThe first-born of the spirits fell and caused others to fall, and thus the demons originated. The fall of the spirits was brought about through their desire to separate man from God, in order that he might serve not God but them. Man, however, was implicated in this fall, lost his blessed abode and his soul was deserted by the divine spirit, and sank into the material sphere, in which only a faint reminiscence of God remained alive.\n\nAs by freedom man fell, so by freedom he may turn again to God. The Spirit unites with the souls of those who walk uprightly; through the prophets he reminds men of their lost likeness to God. Although Tatian does not mention the name of Jesus, his doctrine of redemption culminates in his Christology.\n\n\n\n"}

These individuals are also called wannarexic, “wanna-be ana” or \"anorexic wannabe\". The neologism \"wannarexia\" is a portmanteau of the latter two terms. It may be used as a pejorative term.\n\nWannarexia is a cultural phenomenon and has no diagnostic criteria, although some wannarexics may be instead diagnosed with eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). Wannarexia is more commonly, but not always, found in teenage girls who want to be trendy, and is likely caused by a combination of cultural and media influences.\n\nDr. Richard Kreipe states that the distinction between anorexia and wannarexia is that anorexics aren't satisfied by their weight loss, while wannarexics are more likely to derive pleasure from weight loss. Many people who actually suffer from the eating disorder anorexia are angry, offended, or frustrated about wannarexia.\n\nWannarexics may be inspired or motivated by the pro-anorexia, or pro-ana, community that promotes or supports anorexia as a lifestyle choice rather than an eating disorder. Some participants in pro-ana web forums only want to associate with \"real anorexics\" and will shun wannarexics who only diet occasionally, and are not dedicated to the \"lifestyle\" full-time. Community websites for anorexics and bulimics have posted advice to wannarexics saying that they don't want their \"warped perspectives and dangerous behaviour to affect others.\"\n\nKelsey Osgood uses the label in her book \"How To Disappear Completely: On Modern Anorexia\" where she describes wannarexia as “a gateway drug for teenagers”.\n"}
