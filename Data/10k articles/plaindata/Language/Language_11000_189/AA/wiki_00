The AOP links in a linear way existing knowledge along one or more series of causally connected key events (KE) between two points — a molecular initiating event (MIE) and an adverse outcome (AO) that occur at a level of biological organization relevant to risk assessment. The linkage between the events is described by key event relationships (KER) that describe the causal relationships between the key events. \nAOPs are important for expanding the use of mechanistic toxicological data for risk assessment and regulatory applications.\n\nIn 2012, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched a new programme on the development of adverse outcome pathways. A guidance document describes in detail how AOPs are to be developed, reviewed, agreed and published at the OECD level. The AOP development and reviewing workflow is intended to take place via a web-based IT management tool: the Adverse Outcome Pathway Knowledge Base (AOP-KB) which is currently still under development. It is the wiki-based, user-friendly tool providing open-source interface for collaborative sharing of established AOPs and building new AOPs. \nThe AOP-KB gives the scientific community the possibility to enter, share and discuss their AOP-related knowledge at one central point of information.\nThe AOP-KB allows for building AOPs by entering and then linking information about MIEs, KEs, AOs and Chemical Initiators.\nKnowing that pathway elements are not necessarily unique to a single AOP, value is added to existing knowledge by facilitating the re-use of MIE, KE and AO information in multiple AOPs, which prevents redundancy and make the collective knowledge about those entities available in all AOPs in which they appear.\n\nThe AOP-KB is a combination of individually developed applications, synchronised and orchestrated in a way that gives users the possibility to capture, review, browse and comment on AOPs shared by the AOP stakeholder community.\n\nThe AOP-KB project is an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development initiative, which is executed as close collaboration between the Joint Research Centre of European Commission, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Engineer Research and Development Center of United States Army Corps of Engineers for the purpose of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's programme on the development of AOPs \n\nScientific workshops held for advancing the concept of AOP:\n\nJanuary 23–25, Baltimore, USA \"Building Shared Experience to Advance Practical Application of Pathway-Based Toxicology:Liver Toxicity Mode-of-Action\"\n\nMarch 2–7, Somma Lombardo, Italy \"Advancing Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOP) for Integrated Toxicology and Regulatory Applications\" \n\nAugust 24, Prague, Czech Republic \"AOPs 101: The How and Why of Development and Use\" \n\nSeptember 3–5, Bethesda, USA \"Adverse Outcome Pathways: From Research to Regulation\" workshop held by NTP Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.

The \"De Medicina\" is a primary source on diet, pharmacy, surgery and related fields, and it is one of the best sources concerning medical knowledge in the Roman world. The lost portions of his encyclopedia likely included volumes on agriculture, law, rhetoric, and military arts. He made contributions to the classification of human skin disorders in dermatology, such as Myrmecia, and his name is often occurring in medical terms about the skin, e.g., kerion celsi and area celsi.\n\nNothing is known about the life of Celsus. Even his praenomen is uncertain; he has been called both Aurelius and Aulus, with the latter being more plausible. Some incidental expressions in his \"De Medicina\" suggest that he lived under the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius; which is confirmed by his reference to Themison as being recently in his old age. It is not known with any certainty where he lived. He has been identified as the possible dedicator of a gravestone in Rome, but it has also been supposed that he lived in Narbonese Gaul, because he refers to a species of vine (\"marcum\") which, according to Pliny, was native to that region. It is doubtful whether he practised medicine himself, and although Celsus seems to describe and recommend his own medical observations sanctioned by experience, Quintilian says that his volumes included all sorts of literary matters, and even agriculture and military tactics.\n\nOf the numerous volumes of his encyclopedia, only one remains intact, his celebrated treatise \"On Medicine\" (\"De Medicina\"). \"The work’s encyclopedic arrangement follows the tripartite division of medicine at the time as established by Hippocrates and Asclepiades — diet, pharmacology, and surgery.\" It is divided into eight books.\n\n\nIn the \"Prooemium\" or introduction to \"De Medicina\" there is an early discussion of the relevance of theory to medical practice and the pros and cons of both animal experimentation and human experimentation. Celsus discusses, for example, the case of Herophilos and Erasistratos, who he asserts practised vivisection.\n\nIn the treatment of disease, Celsus' principal method was to observe and watch over the operations of Nature, and to regulate rather than oppose them, conceiving that fever consisted essentially in an effort of the body to throw off some morbid cause, and that, if not unduly interfered with, the process would terminate in a state of health. On occasions, however, he boldly recommends the use of the scalpel; his rules for blood letting and purgatives are laid down with detail and precision; and many of the rules he prescribes were not very different from those still in use at the beginning of the 19th century. His work contains detailed descriptions of the symptoms and different varieties of fever, and he is credited with recording the cardinal signs of inflammation known as \"Celsus tetrad\": \"calor\" (warmth), \"dolor\" (pain), \"tumor\" (swelling) and \"rubor\" (redness and hyperaemia). He goes into great detail regarding the preparation of numerous ancient medicinal remedies including the preparation of opioids. In addition, he describes many 1st century Roman surgical procedures which included removal of a cataract, treatment for bladder stones, and the setting of fractures.\n\nDuring the twentieth century, many historians claimed that Celsus believed that the crystalline lens is in the exact center of the eye. In fact, Celsus made no specific statement about the position of the crystalline lens, and his Graeco-Roman contemporaries did understand that the lens is located to the front.\n\nHippocrates used the Greek word \"carcinos\", meaning crab or crayfish, to refer to malignant tumors. It was Celsus who translated the Greek term into the Latin \"cancer\", also meaning crab.\n\nThe first printed edition of Celsus' work was published in 1478. His style has been much admired as being equal in purity and elegance to that of the best writers of the Augustan age.\n\nAlso, Celsus wrote a technical work on agriculture, on which Columella partly based his \"De Re Rustica.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21316961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21316961", "title": "Balancing and deranking", "text": "Balancing and deranking\n\nIn linguistics, balancing and deranking are terms used to describe the form of verbs used in various types of subordinate clauses and also sometimes in co-ordinate constructions.\n\n\nVerb forms that occur in subordinate clauses of various languages that cannot occur in independent clauses are of various types, but there do exist some typical patterns that differentiate these forms from main-clause verb forms in the same language.\n\n\nLanguages that use deranking for their subordinate-clause verb forms do so according to a definite pattern.\n\nThere are relatively few languages that use deranked verb forms for \"all\" subordinate clauses (examples are found amongst the Tungusic and Salishan languages) but most languages with significant verb inflection use deranking for at least some of their subordinate clauses. Exceptions can be found only amongst certain rigidly head-marking languages such as Ainu and Lakhota. Languages with deranking far down (rightward) on the hierarchy are most typically those with extensive nominal case systems. This is because in their presence information expressed by person marking on the verb is already expressed on nouns. If relations of core noun phrases are marked only on the verb, it is less uneconomic to express them in a dependent clause.\n\nThe distribution of balancing and deranking in languages that do not belong to one of the two polar types briefly discussed in the previous page follows a definite hierarchy. If balancing is used at any point, it is used for all points below it on the following list (\"to the right\" in traditional wording of the deranking hierarchy) Relevant clauses for each example are italicised.\n\n\nThe commonly accepted explanation for the hierarchy outlined in the previous section is that the types of relation at the top of the deranking hierarchy are much more semantically integrated than those at the bottom. Being semantically integrated means that the events in the main and subordinate clauses are linked, which is true of purpose, perception, \"before\", \"when\" and \"after\" clauses, but not of those further rightward in the hierarchy. This integration leads to the use of verb forms not marked for tense, person or aspect, since they are much simpler than verb forms with these markers. \n\nRelations that are temporal and imply that the dependent event takes place within a particular time reference relative to the main event favour verb forms that are unmarked for tense or aspect for the same reason. This is why temporal relations like \"before\", \"when\" and \"after\" come above relationships that have no temporal implication of this type like conditionals.\n\nAnother factor influencing use of deranking is lack of realisation of the dependent event, which often leads in purpose, desiderative and manipulative clauses to the use of moods that cannot be used in independent clauses.\n"}

{"id": "3282778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3282778", "title": "Binary-to-text encoding", "text": "Binary-to-text encoding\n\nA binary-to-text encoding is encoding of data in plain text. More precisely, it is an encoding of binary data in a sequence of printable characters. These encodings are necessary for transmission of data when the channel does not allow binary data (such as email or NNTP) or is not 8-bit clean. PGP documentation () uses the term ASCII armor for binary-to-text encoding when referring to Base64.\n\nThe ASCII text-encoding standard uses 128 unique values (0–127) to represent the alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation characters commonly used in English, plus a selection of control codes which do not represent printable characters. For example, the capital letter \"A\" is ASCII character 65, the numeral \"2\" is ASCII 50, the character \"<nowiki>}</nowiki>\" is ASCII 125, and the metacharacter \"carriage return\" is ASCII 13. Systems based on ASCII use seven bits to represent these values digitally.\n\nIn contrast, most computers store data in memory organized in eight-bit bytes. Files that contain machine-executable code and non-textual data typically contain all 256 possible eight-bit byte values. Many computer programs came to rely on this distinction between seven-bit \"text\" and eight-bit \"binary\" data, and would not function properly if non-ASCII characters appeared in data that was expected to include only ASCII text. For example, if the value of the eighth bit is not preserved, the program might interpret a byte value above 127 as a flag telling it to perform some function.\n\nIt is often desirable, however, to be able to send non-textual data through text-based systems, such as when one might attach an image file to an e-mail message. To accomplish this, the data is encoded in some way, such that eight-bit data is encoded into seven-bit ASCII characters (generally using only alphanumeric and punctuation characters—the ASCII printable characters). Upon safe arrival at its destination, it is then decoded back to its eight-bit form. This process is referred to as binary to text encoding. Many programs perform this conversion to allow for data-transport, such as PGP and GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).\n\nBinary-to-text encoding methods are also used as a mechanism for encoding plain text. For example:\nBy using a binary-to-text encoding on messages that are already plain text, then decoding on the other end, one can make such systems appear to be completely transparent.\nThis is sometimes referred to as 'ASCII armoring'. For example, the ViewState component of ASP.NET uses base64 encoding to safely transmit text via HTTP POST,\nin order to avoid delimiter collision.\nThe table below compares the most used forms of binary-to-text encodings. The efficiency listed is the ratio between number of bits in the input and the number of bits in the encoded output.\n\nThe 95 isprint codes 32 to 126 are known as the ASCII printable characters.\n\nSome older and today uncommon formats include BOO, BTOA, and USR encoding.\n\nMost of these encodings generate text containing only a subset of all ASCII printable characters: for example, the base64 encoding generates text that only contains upper case and lower case letters, (A–Z, a–z), numerals (0–9), and the \"+\", \"/\", and \"=\" symbols.\n\nSome of these encoding (quoted-printable and percent encoding) are based on a set of allowed characters and a single escape character. The allowed characters are left unchanged, while all other characters are converted into a string starting with the escape character. This kind of conversion allows the resulting text to be almost readable, in that letters and digits are part of the allowed characters, and are therefore left as they are in the encoded text.\nThese encodings produce the shortest plain ASCII output for input that is mostly printable ASCII.\n\nSome other encodings (base64, uuencoding) are based on mapping all possible sequences of six bits into different printable characters. Since there are more than 2 = 64 printable characters, this is possible. A given sequence of bytes is translated by viewing it as stream of bits, breaking this stream in chunks of six bits and generating the sequence of corresponding characters. The different encodings differ in the mapping between sequences of bits and characters and in how the resulting text is formatted.\n\nSome encodings (the original version of BinHex and the recommended encoding for CipherSaber) use four bits instead of six, mapping all possible sequences of 4 bits onto the 16 standard hexadecimal digits.\nUsing 4 bits per encoded character leads to a 50% longer output than base64, but simplifies encoding and decoding—expanding each byte in the source independently to two encoded bytes is simpler than base64's expanding 3 source bytes to 4 encoded bytes.\n\nOut of PETSCII's first 192 codes, 164 have visible representations when quoted: 5 (white), 17–20 and 28–31 (colors and cursor controls), 32–90 (ascii equivalent), 91–127 (graphics), 129 (orange), 133–140 (function keys), 144–159 (colors and cursor controls), and 160–192 (graphics). This theoretically permits encodings, such as base128, between PETSCII-speaking machines.\n"}

{"id": "5167735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5167735", "title": "Dutch conjugation", "text": "Dutch conjugation\n\nThis article explains the conjugation of Dutch verbs.\n\nThere are two different ways in which Dutch verbs can be grouped: by conjugational class and by derivation. These two categorizations describe different aspects of a verb's conjugation and therefore are complementary to each other.\n\nDutch verbs can be grouped by their conjugational class, as follows:\n\n\nAnother way to group verbs is by the type of derivation. The following can be distinguished:\n\n\nMost of this article shows the conjugation of basic verbs. The differences in prefixed and separable verbs are described here, and can be applied to any verb regardless of conjugation.\n\nPrefixed verbs are verbs whose stem begins with an unstressed prefix. The prefix is usually one of \"be-\", \"ge-\", \"her-\", \"ont-\", \"ver-\", but others are also possible, often derived from adverbs or prepositions. Prefixed verbs are conjugated like basic verbs, except in the past participle. In the past participle, the inflectional prefix \"ge-\" is replaced by the verb's own prefix, and it is not added on. The past participle of \"heropenen\" (\"to reopen\") is \"heropend\" (not *\"geheropend\"), and for \"betalen\" (\"to pay\") it is \"betaald\" (not *\"gebetaald\").\n\nIn some cases, two verbs exist that are spelled identically, but with one treating an adverb as a prefix, while the other treats it as separable. Such pairs are stressed and thus pronounced differently, and accent marks are sometimes written when there is a chance of confusion: \"voorkómen\" (\"to prevent\", prefixed) versus \"vóórkomen\" (\"to occur\", separable), or \"ondergáán\" (\"to undergo\", prefixed) versus \"óndergaan\" (\"to go under, to set\", separable).\n\nPrefixed verbs can be derived from basic verbs or from another prefixed verb. With the prefix \"her-\" (\"again, re-\"), it is also possible to derive prefixed verbs from separable verbs, but such verbs are often defective, with the separated (V2-affected) forms often being avoided by speakers. For example, the verb \"herinrichten\" (\"to rearrange, to redecorate\") is a combination of the prefix \"her-\" and the separable verb \"inrichten\". According to the syntactical rules, this must become \"Ik richt de kamer herin.\" (\"I redecorate the room\"), but using \"herin\" as a separable particle is often avoided as it is not an independent word (unlike the separable particles of most other verbs). Many speakers choose to rephrase it using the adverb \"opnieuw\" (\"again, anew\"): \"Ik richt de kamer opnieuw in.\". In subordinate clauses or with a non-finite verb, there is less objection: \"Mijn vriend keek toe, terwijl ik de kamer herinrichtte.\" (\"My friend looked on, while I redecorated the room.\") or \"Ik heb de kamer heringericht.\" (\"I have redecorated the room.\").\n\nSeparable verbs are combinations of a main verb (which can be basic or prefixed) and a particle. This particle is usually an adverb, but sometimes it can be a direct object or adjective instead. The particle is stressed more strongly than the main verb, which distinguishes separable verbs from prefixed verbs in pronunciation. The main verb of a separable verb is conjugated like it otherwise would, and can be basic (with \"ge-\" in the past participle) or prefixed (without \"ge-\").\n\nThe particle is treated syntactically as a separate verb, and is placed before or after the main verb as syntax dictates:\n\nThe following table shows some examples of this in practice:\n\nDutch verbs conjugate for tense in present and past, and for mood in indicative, subjunctive and imperative. The subjunctive mood in Dutch is archaic or formal, and is rarely used. There are two grammatical numbers (singular and plural) and three grammatical persons. However, many forms are identical to others, so the conjugation doesn't have distinct forms for all possible combinations of these factors (that is, there is considerable syncretism). In particular, there is always just one form for the plural, and only in the present indicative is there a clear distinction among the different singular persons.\n\nEach second-person pronoun may have its own form. The following can be distinguished:\n\n\nAll regular verbs, whether weak, strong or mixed, form the present tense in the same way. This also includes the infinitive and present participle. Only the formation of the past tense differs among regular verbs, depending on whether the verb is strong, weak or mixed. The endings are as follows:\n\nNotes:\n\nAll forms of a given regular verb can be predicted from just three forms, or sometimes four. These are the principal parts of a verb.\n\n\nIn the sections that follow, only the principal parts of each verb are given when this is sufficient to describe the full conjugation of the verb.\n\nAs noted above, the present tense of all regular verbs is formed the same, and follows the same rules. The following table shows the conjugation of two verbs in the present tense:\n\nIf the stem ends in \"-v\" or \"-z\", then these are spelled \"-f\" and \"-s\" at the end of a syllable.\n\nIf the stem ends in \"-t\", then no additional \"-t\" ending is added when this would otherwise be required, as a word cannot end in a double consonant (\"-tt\" in this case) in Dutch spelling. This makes all present singular forms identical.\n\nThe past tense is formed differently depending on whether the verb is weak, strong or mixed.\n\nWeak verbs are the most common type of verb in Dutch, and the only productive type (all newly created verbs are weak). They form their past tense with an ending containing a dental consonant, \"-d-\" or \"-t-\".\n\nWhether \"-d-\" or \"-t-\" is used depends on the final consonant of the verb stem. If the stem ends in a voiceless consonant, then \"-t-\" is used, otherwise \"-d-\". It is often summarised with the mnemonic \"'t kofschip\": if the verb stem ends with one of the consonants of \"'t kofschip\" (\"t, k, f, s, ch, p\"), then the past tense will have \"-t-\". However, it also applies for \"c\", \"q\" and \"x\" and any other letter that is voiceless in pronunciation.\n\nThe following tables show the past tense forms of a weak verb with a past tense in \"-d-\" (stem does not end in voiceless consonant), and with a past tense in \"-t-\" (stem ends in voiceless consonant).\nIf the stem ends in \"-v\" or \"-z\", then these are spelled \"-f\" and \"-s\" at the end of a syllable, as in the present tense. However, they are still pronounced as voiced and when the past tense ending is added, so the stem is still considered voiced, and the past endings have \"-d-\":\n\n\nIf the stem ends in \"-d\" or \"-t\", then no ending is added in the past participle, as a word cannot end in a double consonant (\"-dd-\" or \"-tt\" in this case) in Dutch spelling. The past tense stem will be pronounced the same as the present, but it is still spelled with \"-dd-\" or \"-tt-\", even when the spelling rules would allow this to be simplified. Thus:\nCompare this to English \"set\", which has a similar homophony between present and past.\n\nStrong verbs form their past tenses by changing the vowel of the stem, a process known as ablaut. There are far fewer strong verbs than weak verbs in Dutch, but many of the most commonly used verbs are strong, so they are encountered frequently. There are about 150 strong roots, giving rise to about 800 strong verbs in total, if all derived verbs with separable and inseparable prefixes are included.\n\nStrong verbs use a different set of endings from weak verbs. However, the same rules for final \"-t\", \"-v\", \"-z\" apply.\nThe vowels that occur in present and past are not random, but follow clear patterns. These patterns can be divided into seven \"classes\", some with subgroups. Some verbs are a mixture of two classes or belong to none of the existing classes.\n\nIn the following subsections, the vowel patterns of each class are described. For clarity, long vowels are always written doubled in the patterns. In the actual conjugated verb, they will be single or double according to normal Dutch spelling rules.\n\nClass 1 follows the vowel pattern ij-ee-ee:\n\nClass 2 is divided into two subclasses.\n\nClass 2a follows the vowel pattern ie-oo-oo:\n\nClass 2b follows the vowel pattern ui-oo-oo:\n\nThe verbs \"vriezen\" and \"verliezen\" show grammatischer Wechsel, with \"s/z\" changing to \"r\" in the past tense:\n\nClass 3 is divided into two subclasses.\n\nClass 3a follows the vowel pattern i-o-o:\nThe vowel is usually followed by \"m\" or \"n\" and another consonant.\n\nClass 3b follows e-o-o:\nThe vowel is usually followed by \"l\" or \"r\" and another consonant.\n\nClass 4 follows the vowel pattern ee-a/aa-oo:\nThe vowel in these verbs is usually followed by \"l\", \"r\", \"m\" or \"n\" and no other consonant.\n\nThe verb \"komen\" has an irregular pattern with short \"o\" in the present singular, long \"oo\" in the remaining present tense, and an additional \"w\" in the past:\n\nClass 5 follows the vowel pattern ee-a/aa-ee, with the same change in length as in class 4:\nThe vowel is usually followed by an obstruent consonant.\n\nThe verbs \"bidden\", \"liggen\" and \"zitten\" follow the pattern i-a/aa-ee instead:\nThese three verbs are descended from the old Germanic \"j-present\" verbs, which had an additional suffix \"-j-\" before the endings in the present tense. This suffix caused doubling of the preceding consonant (the West Germanic gemination) and changed the preceding vowel from \"e\" to \"i\".\n\nThe verb \"eten\" is regular but has an extra \"-g-\" in the past participle:\nOriginally, it was simply \"geten\", contracted from earlier \"ge-eten\". An additional \"ge-\" was added on later. Compare German \"essen, gegessen\", which shows the same development.\n\nClass 6 follows the vowel pattern aa-oe-aa. It is the smallest of the strong verb classes, with only a few verbs.\n\nClass 7 follows the vowel pattern X-ie-X, where the two X's are identical. There were originally five subgroups depending on the vowel of the present tense. Class 7a (with \"ee\" or \"ei\" in the present) has disappeared in Dutch, so only four subgroups remain.\n\nClass 7b has oo in the present tense:\n\nClass 7c has a in the present tense:\nTwo verbs have shortened the past tense vowel to \"i\":\n\nIn present tense of the verb \"houden\", the original combination \"-ald-\" underwent L-vocalization, and became \"-oud-\".\nIt also has an alternative form which lacks \"-d\" when it occurs at the end: \"hou\" alongside the regular \"houd\".\n\nClass 7d has aa in the present tense:\n\nClass 7e has oe in the present tense:\n\nSeveral strong verbs have vowel patterns that don't fit with any of the above types.\n\nA number of class 3b strong verbs have replaced their original past tense vowel with the \"-ie-\" of class 7, creating a \"hybrid\" class. The past participle vowel \"o\" of class 3 remains.\n\n\nThe verb \"worden\" also belonged to class 3b, but the past and present vowels appear to have been swapped:\nContrast this with German \"werden\", which kept the older vowel.\n\nClass 6 originally had three \"j-present\" verbs, like \"liggen\" of class 5. These verbs originally followed the pattern e-oe-aa. All three have changed this in one way or another in modern Dutch:\n\nthree verbs appear to follow a class 3b pattern, but have a long vowel instead of a short one:\n\nThe verb \"uitscheiden\" is the only remaining class 7a verb, but it now has a class 1 past (note that \"ei\" and \"ij\" are pronounced the same):\nEven the form \"scheed uit\" is falling out of use, and is being replaced with a weak past \"scheidde uit\", making it a mixed verb.\n\nSome verbs have a mixture of strong and weak forms. These are called \"mixed verbs\" and are relatively common in Dutch. Most mixed verbs are originally strong verbs that have replaced some strong forms with weak forms. However, a few were originally weak but have become strong by analogy.\n\nThe most common type of mixed verb has a weak past tense, but a strong past participle in \"-en\". Most mixed verbs of this type have the same vowel in the present and in the past participle, and therefore appear to be original class 6 and 7 verbs. A few still have the older strong past as an archaic form.\n\nMixed verbs that originally had class 6 pasts:\n\n\nMixed verbs that originally had class 7 pasts:\n\n\nMixed verbs from other classes:\n\n\nA smaller group of verbs, all belonging to class 6, has the reverse situation. The past tense is strong, but the past participle is weak.\n\n\nThe following verbs are very irregular, and may not fit neatly into the strong-weak split.\n\nAn important subset of these verbs are the preterite-present verbs, which are shared by all Germanic languages. In the present tense, they originally conjugated like the past tense of a strong verb. In Dutch, this means that they lack the \"-t\" in the third-person singular present indicative, much like their English equivalents which lack the \"-s\". Their past tense forms are weak, but irregularly so. Most of these verbs have become auxiliary verbs, so they may be missing imperative forms, and perhaps the participles as well.\n\nThe verb \"zijn\" \"to be\" is suppletive, and uses a different root in the present and past. Its present tense is highly irregular, and the past shows grammatischer Wechsel like the strong verb \"vriezen\" (\"s/z\" becomes \"r\").\n\nThe verb \"hebben\" \"to have\" is weak in origin, but has many other irregularities.\n\nThe verb \"weten\" is regular in the present. The past ends in \"-st\".\n\nThe verb \"moeten\" is very similar to \"weten\".\n\nThe verb \"mogen\" is relatively regular. It has a vowel change in the present between singular and plural, reflecting the original vowel change between the singular and plural strong past. The past ends in \"-cht\".\n\nThe verb \"kunnen\" also has a vowel change in the present, and a variety of alternative forms. In the past tense, it has both a vowel change and, in the plural, the weak dental suffix. With 'u' and 'jij' both 'kunt' and 'kan' are possible. While 'kan' is usually used in speech, in writing 'kunt' is preferred in the Netherlands. 'Kan' is considered to be more informal.\n\nThe verb \"zullen\" is the most irregular of the preterite-presents. In the present, the forms strongly resemble those of \"kunnen\". The past is different, and has changed earlier \"-old-\" to \"-oud-\", and then dropped the \"-d-\" in many forms.\n\nLike its English equivalent \"would\", the past tense \"zou\" does not literally indicate past time. Instead, the distinction is one of certainty: the present indicates certain future time, while the past indicates a conditional event. Compare:\n\nThe verb \"willen\" is not a preterite-present verb in origin, but nowadays it inflects much the same.\n\nThere are two different past tense forms. The original form \"wou(den)\" has a change of \"-old-\" to \"-oud-\", like in \"zullen\", but this form is now considered colloquial or dialectal. The newer, regular form \"wilde(n)\" is considered more standard.\n\nA handful of common verbs have a stem ending in a vowel in the present tense. The endings contract with the stem, losing any \"-e-\" in the ending. The following table shows an example.\nThe verbs have a variety of past tense forms, reflecting their differing origins:\n\n\nA few verbs form their past with irregularly because of an early Germanic development called the \"Germanic spirant law\". Both the vowel and the consonant change, sometimes in rather unexpected ways. However, these verbs are still weak even though the vowel changes, because the past tense and participle have a dental suffix (\"-t-\"). The vowel change is not caused by ablaut (which is the origin of the vowel changes in strong verbs), but by an entirely different phenomenon called Rückumlaut.\n\nSix verbs have this type of conjugation. Note that their English equivalents often have similar changes.\n\n\nThe verb \"zeggen\" (\"to say\") is weak, but is often conjugated irregularly in the past. There is also a regular conjugation, which is more common in the south. In some dialects, a similar conjugation is followed for \"leggen\" (\"to lay\").\n"}
{"id": "896469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=896469", "title": "Efficacy", "text": "Efficacy\n\nEfficacy is the ability to get a job done satisfactorily. The word comes from the same roots as \"effectiveness\", and it has often been used synonymously, although in pharmacology a distinction is now often made between efficacy and effectiveness. The word \"efficacy\" is used in pharmacology and medicine to refer both to the maximum response achievable from a pharmaceutical drug in research settings, and to the capacity for sufficient therapeutic effect or beneficial change in clinical settings.\n\nIn pharmacology, efficacy () is the maximum response achievable from an applied or dosed agent, for instance, a small molecule drug. Intrinsic activity is a relative term for a drug's efficacy relative to a drug with the highest observed efficacy. It is a purely descriptive term that has little or no mechanistic interpretation.\n\nIn order for a drug to have an effect, it needs to bind to its target, and then to affect the function of this target. The target of a drug is commonly referred to as a receptor, but can in general be any chemically sensitive site on any molecule found in the body. The nature of such binding can be quantified by characterising how tightly these molecules, the drug and its receptor, interact: this is known as the affinity. Efficacy, on the other hand, is a measure of the action of a drug once binding has occurred. The maximum response, , will be reduced if efficacy is sufficiently low, but any efficacy greater than 20 or so gives essentially the same maximum response.\n\nThe definition of efficacy has been object for discussion. The only way in which absolute measures of efficacy have been obtained is by single ion channel analysis of ligand gated ion channels. It is still not possible to do this for G protein-linked receptors.\n\nIn the case of the glycine receptor and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (muscle type), it has been proposed by Sivilotti \"et al\". that opening of the ion channel involves two steps after agonist is bound. Firstly a conformation change to a higher affinity (but still shut) form, followed by the conformation change from shut to open. It was found that partial agonism results from deficiency in the first step, and that the opening and shutting steps are essentially the same for both full and partial agonists. This has been confirmed and extended by Sine and colleagues (2009). The implication of this work is that efficacy has to be defined by at least two equilibrium constants (or, more generally, by four rate constants).\n\nIt is the combined influence of both affinity and efficacy which will determine how effectively a drug will produced a biological effect, a property known as potency.\n\nIn medicine, efficacy is the capacity for beneficial change (or therapeutic effect) of a given intervention (for example a drug, medical device, surgical procedure, or a public health intervention). Establishment of the efficacy of an intervention is often done relative to other available interventions, with which it will be compared. Specifically, efficacy refers to \"whether a drug demonstrates a health benefit over a placebo or other intervention when tested in an ideal situation, such as a tightly controlled clinical trial.\" These studies focus on a primary parameter to be shown statistically different between placebo and intervention groups. Comparisons of this type are called 'explanatory' randomized controlled trials, whereas 'pragmatic' trials are used to establish the \"effectiveness\" of an intervention regarding also non-specific parameters.\n\nEffectiveness refers \"how the drug works in a real-world situation,\" and is \"often lower than efficacy because of interactions with other medications or health conditions of the patient, sufficient dose or duration of use not prescribed by the physician or followed by the patient, or use for an off-label condition that had not been tested.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "627040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=627040", "title": "Electronic signature", "text": "Electronic signature\n\nAn electronic signature, or e-signature, refers to data in electronic form, which is logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign. This type of signature provides the same legal standing as a handwritten signature as long as it adheres to the requirements of the specific regulation it was created under (e.g., eIDAS in the European Union, NIST-DSS in the USA or ZertES in Switzerland).\n\nElectronic signatures are a legal concept distinct from digital signatures, a cryptographic mechanism often used to implement electronic signatures. While an electronic signature can be as simple as a name entered in an electronic document, digital signatures are increasingly used in e-commerce and in regulatory filings to implement electronic signatures in a cryptographically protected way. Standardization agencies like NIST or ETSI provide standards for their implementation (e.g., NIST-DSS, XAdES or PAdES). The concept itself is not new, with common law jurisdictions having recognized telegraph signatures as far back as the mid-19th century and faxed signatures since the 1980s.\n\nAn electronic signature is intended to provide a secure and accurate identification method for the signatory to provide a seamless transaction.\nDefinitions of electronic signatures vary depending on the applicable jurisdiction. A common denominator in most countries is the level of an advanced electronic signature requiring that:\n\nElectronic signatures may be created with increasing levels of security, with each having its own set of requirements and means of creation on various levels that prove the validity of the signature. To provide an even stronger probative value than the above described advanced electronic signature, some countries like the European Union or Switzerland introduced the qualified electronic signature. It is difficult to challenge the authorship of a statement signed with a qualified electronic signature - the statement is non-reputable. Technically, a qualified electronic signature is implemented through an advanced electronic signature that utilizes a digital certificate, which has been encrypted through a security signature-creating device and which has been authenticated by a qualified trust service provider.\n\nSince well before the American Civil War began in 1861, morse code was used to send messages electrically by telegraphy. Some of these messages were agreements to terms that were intended as enforceable contracts. An early acceptance of the enforceability of telegraphic messages as electronic signatures came from the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1869.\n\nIn the 1980s, many companies and even some individuals began using fax machines for high-priority or time-sensitive delivery of documents. Although the original signature on the original document was on paper, the image of the signature and its transmission was electronic.\n\nCourts in various jurisdictions have decided that enforceable electronic signatures can include agreements made by email, entering a personal identification number (PIN) into a bank ATM, signing a credit or debit slip with a digital pen pad device (an application of graphics tablet technology) at a point of sale, installing software with a clickwrap software license agreement on the package, and signing electronic documents online.\n\nThe first agreement signed electronically by two sovereign nations was a Joint Communiqué recognizing the growing importance of the promotion of electronic commerce, signed by the United States and Ireland in 1998.\n\nIn 1996 the United Nations published the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce. Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce was highly influential in the development of electronic signature laws around the world, including in the US. In 2001, UNCITRAL concluded work on a dedicated text, the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures, which has been adopted in some 30 jurisdictions. The latest UNCITRAL text dealing with electronic signatures is article 9, paragraph 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts, 2005, which establishes a mechanism for functional equivalence between electronic and handwritten signatures at the international level as well as for the cross-border recognition.\n\nCanadian law (PIPEDA) attempts to clarify the situation by first defining a generic electronic signature as \"a signature that consists of one or more letters, characters, numbers or other symbols in digital form incorporated in, attached to or associated with an electronic document\", then defining a secure electronic signature as an electronic signature with specific properties. PIPEDA's secure electronic signature regulations refine the definition as being a digital signature applied and verified in a specific manner.\n\nIn the European Union, EU Regulation No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European internal market (eIDAS) sets the legal frame for electronic signatures. It repeals Directive 1999/93/EC. The current and applicable version of eIDAS was published by the European Parliament and the European Council on July 23, 2014. Following Article 25 (1) of the eIDAS regulation, an advanced electronic signature shall “not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings\". However it will reach a higher probative value when enhanced to the level of a qualified electronic signature. By requiring the use of a qualified electronic signature creation device and being based on a certificate that has been issued by a qualified trust service provider, the upgraded advanced signature then carries according to Article 25 (2) of the eIDAS Regulation the same legal value as a handwritten signature. However, this is only regulated in the European Union and similarly through ZertES in Switzerland. A qualified electronic signature is not defined in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Code defines an electronic signature for the purpose of US law as \"an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.\" It may be an electronic transmission of the document which contains the signature, as in the case of facsimile transmissions, or it may be encoded message, such as telegraphy using Morse code.\n\nIn the United States, the definition of what qualifies as an electronic signature is wide and is set out in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (\"UETA\") released by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 1999. It was influenced by ABA committee white papers and the uniform law promulgated by NCCUSL. Under UETA, the term means \"an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.\" This definition and many other core concepts of UETA are echoed in the U.S. ESign Act of 2000. 47 US states, the District of Columbia, and the US Virgin Islands have enacted UETA. Only New York, Washington State, and Illinois have not enacted UETA, but each of those states has adopted its own electronic signatures statute.\n\nVarious laws have been passed internationally to facilitate commerce by the use of electronic records and signatures in interstate and foreign commerce. The intent is to ensure the validity and legal effect of contracts entered into electronically. For instance,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital signatures are cryptographic implementations of electronic signatures used as a proof of authenticity, data integrity and non-repudiation of communications conducted over the Internet. When implemented in compliance to digital signature standards, digital signing should offer end-to-end privacy with the signing process being user-friendly and secure. Digital signatures are generated and verified through standardized frameworks such as the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). by NIST or in compliance to the XAdES, PAdES or CAdES standards, specified by the ETSI.\n\nThere are typically three algorithms involved with the digital signature process:\n\nThe process of digital signing requires that the signature generated by both the fixed message and private key can then be authenticated by its accompanied public key. Using these cryptographic algorithms, the user’s signature cannot be replicated without having access to their private key. A secure channel is not typically required. By applying asymmetric cryptography methods, the digital signature process prevents several common attacks where the attacker attempts to gain access through the following attack methods.\n\nThe most relevant standards on digital signatures with respect to size of domestic markets are the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the eIDAS Regulation enacted by the European Parliament. OpenPGP is a non-proprietary protocol for email encryption through public key cryptography. It is supported by PGP and GnuPG, and some of the S/MIME IETF standards and has evolved into the most popular email encryption standard in the world.\n\nElectronic signature may also refer to electronic forms of processing or verifying identity through use of biometric \"signatures\" or biologically identifying qualities of an individual. Such signatures use the approach of attaching some biometric measurement, or hash of said measurement, to a document as evidence. For instance, fingerprints, hand geometry (finger lengths and palm size), iris patterns, or even retinal patterns. All of these are collected using electronic sensors of some kind. Since each of these physical characteristics has claims to uniqueness among humans, each is to some extent useful as a signature.\n\nBiometric measurements of this type are useless as passwords, as they can't be changed if compromised. However, they might be serviceable as electronic signatures of a kind, except that to date they have been so easily spoofable that they can carry little assurance that the person who purportedly signed a document was actually the person who did. Unfortunately, each is easily spoofable by a replay of the electronic signal produced and submitted to the computer system responsible for 'affixing' a signature to a document. Wiretapping techniques often suffice for this. In the particular case of fingerprints, a Japanese professor and some graduate students managed to spoof all of the commercially available fingerprint readers available to them with some ordinary kitchen chemistry (gummy bear candy gel) and a little ingenuity. No actual fingers were needed to successfully spoof every reading device. In another example, researchers in Vietnam successfully demonstrated in late 2017 how a specially crafted mask could beat Apple's Face ID program on iPhone X.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12799", "title": "Graphic design", "text": "Graphic design\n\nGraphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \"graphic design\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage.\n\nThe term graphic design was coined by William Addison Dwiggins in 1922. However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of Lascaux, to Rome's Trajan's Column to the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of Ginza, Tokyo. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\". This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the Rosetta Stone. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" The Egyptians also invented papyrus, paper made from reeds found along the Nile, on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"Dark Ages\", from 500 to 1450 , monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with Benjamin Franklin who used his newspaper \"The Pennsylvania Gazette\", to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, Andrew Bradford as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his \"General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America\" (the precursor to the Saturday Evening Post) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named called the \"Pennsylvania Fireplace\". His invention is still sold today and is known as \"the Franklin stove\". \"\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize logos, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.\n\nDuring the Tang Dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using movable type printing, making books widely available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).\n\nDuring the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter William Hogarth used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, Johann Gutenberg introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a printing press and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, criers announced products for sale just as ancient Romans had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. Aldus Manutius developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called Humanist or Old Style. Additionally, William Caxton, England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed \"squis\" or \"\"pin up\" posters,\" in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe\".\" The term \"Siquis\" came from the Roman era when public notices were posted stating \"if anybody...\", which is Latin for \"si quis\". These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of \"wants\" called \"want ads\" and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as \"want ad media\" or \"advice columns\".\n\nIn 1638 Harvard University received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller Benjamin Harris received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, \"'Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick'\". It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the \"'Boston News-Letter'\", which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as \"Weeklies\". The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. \"'The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.\"' The initial use of the \"Boston News-Letter\" carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th, 1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in Oyster Bay, owned by William Bradford, a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the New-York Gazette\". Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the \"American Weekly Mercury\", 1719. \"The Mercury\" and William Brooker's \"Massachusetts Gazette\", first published a day earlier.\n\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design education in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his \"Journal of Design and Manufactures\". He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the Arts and Crafts movement, and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, directly influenced Art Nouveau.\n\nThe term \"graphic design\" first appeared in print in the 1922 essay \"New Kind of Printing Calls for New Design\" by William Addison Dwiggins, an American book designer in the early 20th century. Raffe's \"Graphic Design\", published in 1927, was the first book to use \"Graphic Design\" in its title.\n\nThe signage in the London Underground is a classic design example of the modern era and used a typeface designed by Edward Johnston in 1916.\n\nIn the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.\n\nJan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 1928 book, \"New Typography\". He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential. Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers such as Herbert Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design. They pioneered production techniques and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century. The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application. The post-World War II American economy revealed a greater need for graphic design, mainly in advertising and packaging. The spread of the German Bauhaus school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" architecture and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include Adrian Frutiger, designer of the typefaces Univers and Frutiger; Paul Rand, who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as corporate identity; Alex Steinweiss, credited with the invention of the album cover; and Josef Müller-Brockmann, who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with consumerism. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the First Things First manifesto. First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, it was re-published as the First Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999 in the magazine \"Emigre\" 51 stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design.\" Both editions attracted signatures from practitioners and thinkers such as Rudy VanderLans, Erik Spiekermann, Ellen Lupton and Rick Poynor. The 2000 manifesto was also published in Adbusters, known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from road signs to technical schematics, from interoffice memorandums to reference manuals.\n\nDesign can aid in selling a product or idea. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as logos, colors, packaging and text as part of branding (see also advertising). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the entertainment industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl album covers, comic books, DVD covers, opening credits and closing credits in filmmaking, and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as information design. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include data visualization, which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with information graphics.\n\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing text and either preexisting imagery or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as interactive design, or multimedia design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these message. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type glyphs and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.\n\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of type (text), images (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a dieline for elements that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on paper and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires judgment and creativity. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and rendering. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an art director), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using traditional media and guides, or digital image editing tools on computers. Tools in computer graphics often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"pen\". Some graphic design tools such as a grid are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s desktop publishing and graphic art software applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as pencils can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the creative process. Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.\n\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process. Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or paste-up. While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered layouts are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of Adobe Systems Incorporated. Adobe Photoshop (a raster-based program for photo editing) and Adobe Illustrator (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed raster images and vector graphics in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as Adobe InDesign, Serif PagePlus and QuarkXpress. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design. These include Inkscape (for vector graphics), GIMP (for photo-editing and image manipulation), Krita (for painting) and Scribus (for page layout).\n\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in interface design, in an environment commonly referred to as a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This has included web design and software design, when end user interactivity is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with software developers and web developers to create the look and feel of a web site or software application. An important aspect of interface design is icon design.\n\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are wayfinding, placemaking, branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the creative spectrum and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year. The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include graphic designer, art director, creative director, animator and entry level production artist. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"DTP Associate\" or \"Graphic Artist\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as illustration, photography, animation or interactive design.\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations. Graphic designers may also work freelance, working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the art director, creative director or senior media creative. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as brand development and corporate identity development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\nJeff Howe of \"Wired Magazine\" first used the term \"crowdsourcing\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\" It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10380867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10380867", "title": "Hebrew Braille", "text": "Hebrew Braille\n\nHebrew Braille () is the braille alphabet for Hebrew. The International Hebrew Braille Code is widely used. It was devised in the 1930s and completed in 1944. It is based on international norms, with additional letters devised to accommodate differences between English Braille and the Hebrew alphabet. Unlike Hebrew, but in keeping with other braille alphabets, Hebrew Braille is read from left to right instead of right to left., and unlike English Braille, it is a Abjad, all consonants.\n\nPrior to the 1930s, there were several regional variations of Hebrew Braille, but no universal system. In 1936, the Jewish Braille Institute of America assembled an international panel to attempt to produce a unified code. Among the greater challenges faced by the panel was the accommodation of the Hebrew vowel points. The panel completed its first iteration of the International Hebrew Braille Code in 1936, the same year in which the first Hebrew Braille book was published with sponsorship from the Library of Congress: a volume of excerpts from the \"Talmud\" and other sources. The code underwent further refinements for the better part of a decade until its completion in 1944.\n\nBecause Hebrew Braille derives from English Braille, there is not a one-to-one match between Hebrew letters in print and in braille. Most obviously, four consonants with the \"dagesh\" point in print have distinct letters in braille, but three others require a \"dagesh\" prefix in braille. The different placements of the dot on the print letter \"shin\" also correspond to two different letters in braille. On the other hand, the distinct final forms of some letters in print are not reflected in braille.\n\nIn the table below, the braille letters corresponding to basic letters in print are in the top row, while those derived by pointing in print, and which have a distinct pronunciation in Modern Hebrew, are in the second row.\n\nFor other pointed print consonants, such as \"gimel\" with \"dagesh\" , the braille prefix is used: . Historically, this sequence has two values: a 'hard' gee (cf. plain \"gimel\" ), and a double/long gee . However, it is not distinct in Modern Hebrew. It is not clear if the prefix can be added to letters that have partners in the bottom row of the table above to distinguish, say, dagesh hazak \"kk\" from dagesh kal \"k\", or \"ww\" from \"û\".\n\nWhen transcribing completely unpointed print texts, only the top row of braille letters is used.\n\nApart from those written with and and thus obligatory in print, vowels are optional in braille just as they are in print. When they are written, braille vowels are full letters rather than diacritics.\n\nPrint digraphs with schwa ( \"ĕ\", \"ă\", \"ŏ\", bottom row), and the \"matres lectionis\" ( \"û\", \"ô\", \"î\") are derived in braille by modifying (lowering or reflecting) the base vowel. \"ê\" does not have a dedicated braille letter, and is written as the vowel \"e\" plus yod.\n\nThe punctuation used with Hebrew Braille, according to Unesco (2013), is as follows:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10398617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10398617", "title": "History of Interlingua", "text": "History of Interlingua\n\nThe history of Interlingua comprises the formation of the language itself as well as its community of speakers.\n\nUltimate credit for Interlingua must go to the American heiress Alice Vanderbilt Morris (1874–1950), who became interested in linguistics and the international auxiliary language movement in the early 1920s. In 1924, Morris and her husband, Dave Hennen Morris, established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in New York City. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a scientific basis.\n\nInvestigations of the auxiliary language problem were in progress at the International Research Council, the American Council on Education, the American Council of Learned Societies, the British, French, Italian, and American Associations for the advancement of science, and other groups of specialists. Morris created IALA as a continuation of this work. She developed the research program of IALA in consultation with Edward Sapir, William Edward Collinson, and Otto Jespersen.\n\nThe IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics, funding, for example, Sapir's cross-linguistic semantic studies of totality (1930) and grading phenomena (1944). Morris herself edited Sapir and Morris Swadesh's 1932 cross-linguistic study of ending-point phenomena, and Collinson's 1937 study of indication. Although the Morrises and their family provided most of IALA's funding, it also received support from such prestigious groups as the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nIn its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about languages and interlinguistics; and comparing extant IALs, including Esperanto, Esperanto II, Ido, Peano’s Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Novial, and Interlingue (Occidental). In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages, under the direction of scholars at American and European universities. It also arranged conferences with proponents of these IALs, debating features and goals of their representative languages. With a \"concession rule\" that required participants to make a certain number of concessions, early debates at IALA sometimes grew from heated to explosive.\n\nAt the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in Geneva in 1931, IALA began to break new ground. Its conference was attended by recognized linguists, 27 of whom signed a testimonial of support for IALA's research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in Rome in 1933.\n\nAlso in 1933, Professor Herbert N. Shenton of Syracuse University organized an intensive study of the problems encountered with interlanguages when used in international conferences. Later that same year, Dr. Edward L. Thorndike published a paper about the relative learning speeds of \"natural\" and \"modular\" constructed languages. Both Shenton and Thorndike were major influences on IALA's work from then on.\n\nIn 1937, the first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken when a committee of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published \"Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary\". However, the outbreak of World War II in 1939 cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.\n\nOriginally, the association had not set out to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded that none of the existing interlanguages were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.\n\nTo that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., Novial and Occidental) or systematic (e.g., Esperanto and Ido) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Dr. Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many – or even a majority – of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a Procrustean bed, forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the systematic languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, IALA's research activities were moved from Liverpool to New York, where E. Clark Stillman established a new research staff. Stillman, with the assistance of Dr. Alexander Gode, developed a \"prototyping\" technique – an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of \"control languages\".\n\nIn 1943 Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research. In 1945, IALA published a \"General Report\" – largely Morris's work – which presented three models for IALA's language:\n\nFrom 1946 to 1948, the renowned French linguist André Martinet was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. An initial survey gauged reactions to the three models of 1945. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.\n\nFour models were canvassed: Model P and K, plus two new models similar to Model E of 1945.\n\nModel P was unchanged from 1945; Model M was relatively modern in comparison to more classical P. Model K was slightly modified in the direction of Ido.\n\nThe results of the survey were striking. The two more schematic models, C and K, were rejected – K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M attracted somewhat more support than P. Taking national biases into account (for example, the French who were polled disproportionately favored Model M), IALA decided on a compromise between models M and P, with certain elements of C.\n\nWhen Martinet took up a position at Columbia University in 1948, Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua's development. His task was to combine elements of Model M and Model P; take the flaws seen in both by the polled community and repair them with elements of Model C as needed; and simultaneously develop a vocabulary.\n\nThe vocabulary and verb conjugations of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized \"\" and the 27,000-word \"Interlingua-English Dictionary\" (IED). In 1954, IALA published an introductory manual entitled \"Interlingua a Prime Vista\" (\"Interlingua at First Sight\").\n\nAn early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter \"Spectroscopia Molecular\", published from 1952 to 1980. In 1954 Interlingua was used at the Second World Cardiological Congress, in Washington DC, for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. Science Service, the publisher of \"Science Newsletter\" at the time, published a monthly column in Interlingua from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the powerful International Organization for Standardization, which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt Interlingua as the basis for its dictionaries.\n\nThe IALA closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later. Its role in promoting Interlingua was largely taken on by Science Service, which hired Gode as head of its newly formed Interlingua Division. Hugh E. Blair, Gode's close friend and colleague, became his assistant. A successor organization, the Interlingua Institute, was founded in 1970 to promote Interlingua in the US and Canada. The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua precis for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on phytopathology produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977. \n\nThe Interlingua Institute was adrift for a while after the deaths of Blair in 1967 and Gode in 1970. According to Esterhill, however, publishing slowed only briefly in the late 1960s and revived soon afterward, at about the time of the 1971 second edition of the IED. Flourishing interest in Europe may have counterbalanced the struggles taking place in America.\n\nInterlingua had attracted many former adherents of other international-language projects, notably Occidental and Ido. The former Occidentalist Ric Berger founded The Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI) in 1955, and by the late 1950s, interest in Interlingua in Europe had already begun to overtake that in North America. Media coverage at the time, for example, was apparently heaviest in Northern and Eastern Europe. Frequent European coverage has continued to date, joined by media attention in South America in the early 1990s.\nBeginning in the 1980s UMI has held international conferences every two years (typical attendance at the earlier meetings was 50 to 100) and launched a publishing programme that eventually produced over 100 volumes. Other Interlingua-language works were published by university presses in Sweden and Italy, and in the 1990s, Brazil and Switzerland. Several Scandinavian schools undertook projects that used Interlingua as a means of teaching the international scientific and intellectual vocabulary.\n\nIn 2000, the Interlingua Institute was dissolved amid funding disputes with the UMI; the American Interlingua Society, established the following year, succeeded the institute and responded to new interest emerging in Mexico.\n\nInterlingua was spoken and promoted in the Soviet empire, in spite of persecution and efforts to suppress information about the language. In East Germany, government officials confiscated the letters and magazines that the UMI sent to Walter Raédler, the Interlingua representative there. In Czechoslovakia, Július Tomin received threatening letters after his first article on Interlingua was published. Despite continuing persecution, he went on to become the Czech Interlingua representative, teach Interlingua in the school system, and author a long series of published articles and books.\n\nToday, interest in Interlingua has expanded from the scientific community to the general public. Individuals, governments, and private companies use Interlingua for learning and instruction, travel, online publishing, and communication across language barriers. Interlingua is promoted internationally by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (president: Barbara Rubinstein, Sweden; secretary-general: Petyo Angelov, Bulgaria). Periodicals and books are produced by many national organizations, such as the Societate American pro Interlingua (president: Stanley A. Mulaik), the Svenska Sällskapet för Interlingua (secretary: Ingvar Stenström), and the Brazilian Union for Interlingua (president: Gilson Passos).\n\nCurrently, Panorama In Interlingua is the most prominent of several Interlingua periodicals. It is a 28-page magazine published bimonthly that covers current events, science, editorials, and Interlingua. Thanks to the Internet, Interlingua has seen a resurgence over the last decade, with the number of speakers jumping tenfold by some estimates.\n\n"}
{"id": "1407062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1407062", "title": "I. L. Peretz", "text": "I. L. Peretz\n\nIsaac Leib Peretz (, ) (May 18, 1852 – 3 April 1915), also sometimes written Yitskhok Leybush Peretz, best known as I. L. Peretz, was a Yiddish language author and playwright from Poland. Payson R. Stevens, Charles M. Levine, and Sol Steinmetz count him with Mendele Mokher Seforim and Sholem Aleichem as one of the three great classical Yiddish writers. Sol Liptzin wrote: \"Yitzkhok Leibush Peretz was the great awakener of Yiddish-speaking Jewry, and Sholom Aleichem its comforter... Peretz aroused in his readers the will for self-emancipation, the will for resistance...\"\n\nPeretz rejected cultural universalism, seeing the world as composed of different nations, each with its own character. Liptzin comments that \"Every people is seen by him as a chosen people...\"; he saw his role as a Jewish writer to express \"Jewish ideals...grounded in Jewish tradition and Jewish history.\"\n\nUnlike many other Maskilim, he greatly respected the Hasidic Jews for their mode of being in the world; at the same time, he understood that there was a need to make allowances for human frailty. His short stories such as \"If Not Higher\", \"The Treasure\", and \"Beside the Dying\" emphasize the importance of sincere piety rather than empty religiosity.\n\nBorn in the city of Zamość, Lublin Governorate, Congress Poland, and raised in an Orthodox Jewish home he gave his allegiance at age fifteen to the Haskalah, the Jewish enlightenment. He began a deliberate plan of secular learning, reading books in Polish, Russian, German, and French. He planned to go to the theologically liberal Rabbinical school at Zhytomyr, but concern for his mother's feelings got him to stay on in Zamość. He married, through an arranged marriage, the daughter of Gabriel Judah Lichtenfeld, whom Liptzin describes as a \"minor poet and philosopher\".\n\nHe failed in an attempt to make a living distilling whiskey, but began to write Hebrew language poetry, songs, and tales, some of them written with his father-in-law ; this collaboration, however, did not prevent his divorce in 1878, after which he promptly remarried (his second wife was Helena Ringelheim). At about the same time, he passed the examination to become a lawyer, a profession which he successfully pursued for the next decade, until in 1889 his license was revoked by the Imperial Russian authorities, on the basis of suspicion of Polish nationalist feelings. From then on he lived in Warsaw, where his income came largely from a job in the small bureaucracy of the city's Jewish community. There he founded Hazomir (\"The Nightingale\"), which became the cultural centre of pre-World War I Yiddish Warsaw.\n\nHis first Yiddish work appeared in 1888, notably the long ballad \"Monish\", which appeared that year in the landmark anthology \"Folksbibliotek\" (\"People's Library\"), edited by Sholom Aleichem. This ballad tells the story of an ascetic young man, Monish, who unsuccessfully resists the temptress Lilith.\n\nA writer of social criticism, sympathetic to the labor movement, he wrote stories, folk tales and plays. Liptzin characterizes him as both a realist and a romanticist, who \"delved into irrational layers of the soul\"... ; \"an optimist who believed in the inevitability of progress through enlightenment\", and who, at times, expressed this optimism through \"visions of Messianic possibilities\". Still, while most Jewish intellectuals were unrestrained in their support of the Russian Revolution of 1905, Peretz's view was more reserved, focusing more on the pogroms that took place within the Revolution, and concerned that the Revolution's universalist ideals would leave little space for Jewish non-conformism.\n\nPeretz assisted other Yiddish writers in publishing their work, including Der Nister and Lamed Shapiro.\n\nMuch as Jacob Gordin influenced Yiddish theater in New York City in a more serious direction, so did Peretz in Eastern Europe. Israil Bercovici sees Peretz's works for the stage as a synthesis of Gordin and of the more traditional and melodramatic Abraham Goldfaden, an opinion which Peretz himself apparently would not have rejected: \"The critics\", he wrote, \"the worst of them thought that M.M. Seforim was my model. This is not true. My teacher was Abraham Goldfaden.\"\n\nSome of Peretz's most important works are \"Oyb Nisht Nokh Hekher\" (\"If not Higher\") and the short story \"Bontshe Shvayg\" (\"Bontsche the Silent\"). \"Bontsche\" is the story of an extremely meek and modest man, downtrodden on earth but exalted in heaven for his modesty, who, offered any heavenly reward, chooses one as modest as the way he had lived. While the story can be read as praise of this meekness, there is also an ambiguity in the ending, which can be read as showing contempt for someone who cannot even imagine receiving more.\n\nPeretz's 1907 play \"A Night in the Old Marketplace\" has been adapted into a multimedia theatrical presentation, with music by Frank London and book and lyrics by Glen Berger, slated to open in 2007; the CD is already on sale. Set in a Jewish shtetl, the comedy presents the philosophical and theological questions of living and dying, in Peretz's typical style.\n\nPeretz died in the city of Warsaw, Congress Poland, in 1915. There are streets in Warsaw, in Zamość and in Wrocław (also a square) named after him (\"ulica Icchaka Lejba Pereca\" in Polish). He was buried at the Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery with a huge crowd, about 100 000 strong, attending the burial ceremony.\n\nPeretz Square in Lower Manhattan (New York City, USA), which marks the spot where Houston Street, First Avenue, and First Street meet, is named after him. It was dedicated on November 23, 1952.\n\nThe American journalist Martin Peretz is one of his descendants. The French author Georges Perec was a distant relative. Descendants of Peretz's brother- including physicians, teachers, attorneys, and performers- reside in the Tri-state area of New York City.\n\nThere are streets named after him in Israel in the following cities:\n\nPeretz wrote in both Hebrew and Yiddish. His work \"The Magician\" found inspiration in the folklore of Hasidic Judaism. The story focuses around Elijah, who anonymously visits a poor couple and helps to make them rich. The 1917 edition was illustrated by Marc Chagall. Chagall did not know Peretz and did not read Peretz's work until he was commissioned to create the drawings.\n\n\n\n"}

A dialect of this language (Galilean Aramaic) was spoken by Jesus. The Son of God Text (4Q246), found in Qumran is written in this language as well.\n\nThere were some differences in dialect between Judea and Galilee, and most surviving texts are in the Galilean dialect: Michael Sokoloff has published separate dictionaries of the two dialects.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, the center of Jewish learning in the land of Israel moved to Galilee. With the Arab conquest of the country in the 7th century, Arabic gradually replaced this language.\n\nThe most notable text in this dialect's corpus is the Jerusalem Talmud, which is still studied in Jewish religious schools and academically, although not as widely as the Babylonian Talmud, most of which is written in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. There are some older texts in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, notably the Megillat Taanit: the Babylonian Talmud contains occasional quotations from these.\n\nMany extant manuscripts in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic have been corrupted over the years of their transmission by Eastern Aramaic-speaking scribes freely correcting \"errors\" they came across (these \"errors\" actually being genuine Jewish Palestinian Aramaic features).

The worldwide HQ of Kores is based in Vienna, Austria and its main offices are in Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Rommerskirchen), Mexico (Mexico City), Colombia (Bogotá) and Venezuela (Caracas). Kores has 2 key production facilities in Mexico City and Strmilov (Czech Republic). The iconic Kores dactylo was also portrayed on the cover poster of the Pedro Almodóvar’s movie \"The Flower of my Secret\".\n\nIn the first part of 20th century, Kores expanded to become one of the world’s first globalized companies that produced chemical office products such as carbon paper, in countries as far and wide as China and Egypt. Kores had its own company magazine, Kores Revue, and an official sales handbook on how to sell carbon paper, which are displayed at the Kores museum display at the Vienna HQ. Following a decline in carbon paper sales due to changing office technology, Kores began focusing on the production of glue sticks and correction products from the 1990s, expanding into the new markets of Eastern Europe, as well as supplying global businesses in Western Europe and the United States.\n\nIn the 2000s, under the leadership of Peter Koreska, Kores International Product Management began innovating a growing number of products such as Scooter and 2Way correction tapes, Neon coloured glue sticks, Bright Liner highlighters and Desk Pot and Design Line adhesive tape dispensers. Kores also introduced one of the largest ranges of coloured index notes for bookmarking and referencing. In 2009, the Kolores range of coloring pencils were launched worldwide as Kores expanded into school products. Kolores coloured pencils are known for their soft application, vivid colours and clean sharpening. Following the success of Kolores, Kores launched wax crayons, felt tip pens, pencils and sharpeners.\n\nBy 2010, Peter and Robert Koreska had purchased back the Kores trademark rights for the key markets of Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Scandinavia, thereby optimizing the Kores brand distribution potential. In the same year, Kores Germany launched a complete program of printer consumables, including laser toners, ink jet cartridges and typewriter ribbons, which are offered to the international Kores network of customers. In 2016 Kores celebrated 20 years of production at its Strmilov production plant. In 2017 Kores celebrated 130th anniversary!\n\nThe recent CEO message celebrating 130 years of Kores by Kores President, Clemens Koreska, looks forward to a future where Kores continues to develop high quality, innovative products in line with lifestyle, office and school trends.\n\nIn 2014 Kores was awarded with the Austrian Ecolabel. Now the glue sticks, produced in millions at the Kores factory in Czech Republic, can proudly carry the quality label awarded by the Austrian government. For more than 20 years the Austrian Ecolabel marks environmentally friendly products and services and thus provides guarantee to the customers.\n\nGallery\n\n"}

Though 15 of his books have been translated into French, only 'Babughater Kumari Maach' (The Virgin Fish of Babughat) has been translated into English. He finished his doctorate study in Paris. After spending his working life in India, he went back to France to spend the last decade of his life with his wife who is French. He has translated the poetry of Rimbaud, Henri Michaux into Bengali. He died in Egypt in a car accident.\n\nHe was born in an Orthodox family in Bhatpara, North 24 Parganas West Bengal, India. His initial training was in Sanskrit. He then went to the Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan for higher studies. After studying French in the Alliance Française in Calcutta, he went to University of Paris for his doctoral degree on French government scholarship. He immersed himself in French literature and translated Rimbaud, Henri Michaux and Descartes into Bengali. Despite his significant literary output, Lokenath never received the kind of critical attention he deserved in the Bengali literary circle. As Meenakshi Mukherjeer writes in the introduction of her English translation of the book \"The Virgin Fish of Babughat\", \"He remained a writers' writer, discussed in little magazines and exclusive literary journals, forever an outsider in the mainstream literary world of Kolkata. Apart from the unfamiliarity of his imaginative world, the fact that he spent most of his adult life outside Bengal might also have accentuated his alienation.\" \n\nLokenath was married to France Bhattacharya who in her turn spread Bengali Literature in France. France Bhattacharya, holder of a doctorat d’état in Indian Studies, is emeritus professor, Inalco, member of the Centre for the study on India and South Asia, CEIAS, and was till recently director of the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme programme for India and South Asia. She works on Bengali pre-colonial literature mainly from a perspective of religious and social history.\n\nShe has translated several Bengali novels into French such as: Le monastère de la félicité (Ânandamath) (Paris, Le serpent à plumes, 2003) and Celle qui portait des crânes en boucles d’oreilles (Kapâlkundalâ) by Bankim Chandra Chatterji (Paris, « Connaissance de l’Orient », Gallimard, 2005), Quatre chapitres (Châr adhyây) and Chârulatâ (Nasta nîr) by Rabindranath Tagore (Paris, Zulma, 2004 and 2009), La complainte du sentier (Pather Pâncâlî) by Bibhuti Bhushan Banerji, (Paris, Gallimard, 1969), as well as several fictions by her late husband Lokenath Bhattacharya, and his prose poems Ghar.\n\nNovels:\n\nHe also wrote four volumes of poetry, three plays, two collections of short stories, and two books of discursive prose.\n\n'Babughater Kumari Maach' (বাবুঘাটের কুমারী মাছ, The Virgin Fish of Babughat, 1972) is the only works of his that has been translated into English. Here's the description from the back flap of Meenakshi Mukherjee's translation:\n\n\"The novel is set in a sinister detention camp where men and women are divested of their clothes and their past, but provided with all the luxuries of life including unlimited sexual gratification.\n\nThe narrator, a writer before he was brought to the prison, has been meted a unique punishment: he must fill up a stack of paper with words every day. He turns this task into a life line, writing frantically to recapture a world that is he has lost, to resuscitate the very language that he is in dance of forgetting, and to record the systematic dehumanization which is taking place around him. Yet, his account is not altogether bleak: there are lively accounts of people and events, humour, tenderness, love, and even hope.\"\n\nThis book has some interesting similarity with Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1985).\n\nWhen the novel was written, India and West Bengal was going through a troubled times. The Naxal movement was at its peak in West Bengal. The government was using repressive measures to suppress the violence generated by the Naxalites. According to Mukherjee, the novel may have been a reference to the incidents. Kiranmoy Raha, a critique wrote this after Emergency was declared in India in 1975 (cited in Mukherjee):\n\"'Babughater Kumari Maachh' is a futuristic allegory which projects the culmination of what the author feels to be present tendencies. It is an examination of the human situation in extremis. For an observer of the social scenre around, Lokenath Bhattachary's novel gives an uncomfortable feeling that the future may not be that far away, after all. It may be already there\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1793469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793469", "title": "Oath of the Horatii", "text": "Oath of the Horatii\n\nOath of the Horatii (), is a large painting by the French artist Jacques-Louis David painted in 1784 and now on display in the Louvre in Paris. The painting immediately became a huge success with critics and the public, and remains one of the best known paintings in the Neoclassical style.\n\nIt depicts a scene from a Roman legend about a dispute between two warring cities, Rome and Alba Longa, and stresses the importance of patriotism and masculine self-sacrifice for one's country. Instead of the two cities sending their armies to war, they agree to choose three men from each city; the victor in that fight will be the victorious city. From Rome, three brothers from a Roman family, the Horatii, agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from a family of Alba Longa, the Curiatii. The three brothers, all of whom appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome, are shown saluting their father who holds their swords out for them. Of the three Horatii brothers, only one shall survive the confrontation. However, it is the surviving brother who is able to kill the other three fighters from Alba Longa: he allows the three fighters to chase him, causing them to separate from each other, and then, in turn, kills each Curiatii brother. Aside from the three brothers depicted, David also represents, in the bottom right corner, a woman crying whilst sitting down. She is Camilla, a sister of the Horatii brothers, who is also betrothed to one of the Curiatii fighters, and thus she weeps in the realisation that, in any case, she will lose someone she loves.\n\nThe principal sources for the story behind David's \"Oath\" are the first book of Livy (sections 24–26) which was elaborated by Dionysius in book 3 of his \"Roman Antiquities\". However, the moment depicted in David's painting is his own invention. The painting led to the popularization of the Roman salute.\n\nIt grew to be considered a paragon of neoclassical art. The painting increased David's fame, allowing him to take on his own students.\n\nIn 1774, David won the Prix de Rome with his work \"Érasistrate découvrant la cause de la maladie d’Antiochius\". This allowed him to stay five years (1775–1780) in Rome as a student from the French government. Upon his return to Paris he exhibited his work, which Diderot greatly admired; the success was so resounding that King Louis XVI of France allowed him to stay in the Louvre, a very ancient privilege desired by artists. There he met Pecoul, contractor for the actual buildings, and Pecoul's daughter, whom he married. The king's assistant, Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie, commissioned \"Oath of the Horatii\" with the intention that it be an allegory about loyalty to the state and therefore to the king. Nevertheless, David departed from the agreed-upon scene, painting this scene instead. The painting was not completed in Paris, but rather in Rome, where David was visited by his pupil Jean-Germaine Drouais who had himself recently won the Prix de Rome. Ultimately, David's picture manifests a progressive outlook, deeply influenced by Enlightenment ideas, that eventually contributed to the overthrow of the monarchy. As the French Revolution approached, paintings increasingly referred to the loyalty to the state rather than the family or the church. Painted five years before the Revolution, the \"Oath of the Horatii\" reflects the political tensions of the period.\n\nIn 1789, David painted \"The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons\", a picture that was also a royal commission. Shortly afterward, the king went up to the scaffold also accused of treason, as the sons of Brutus, and with the vote of the artist in the National Assembly, which supported the execution of Louis XVI.\n\nThe painting depicts the Roman Horatius family, who, according to Titus Livius' \"Ab Urbe Condita\" (\"From the Founding of the City\") had been chosen for a ritual duel against three members of the Curiatii, a family from Alba Longa, in order to settle disputes between the Romans and the latter city. As revolution in France loomed, paintings urging loyalty to the state rather than to clan or clergy abounded. Although it was painted nearly four years before the revolution in France, \"The Oath of the Horatii\" became one of the defining images of the time.\n\nIn the painting, the three brothers express their loyalty and solidarity with Rome before battle, wholly supported by their father. These are men willing to lay down their lives out of patriotic duty. With their resolute gaze and taut, outstretched limbs, they are citadels of patriotism. They are symbols of the highest virtues of Rome. Their clarity of purpose, mirrored by David's simple yet powerful use of tonal contrasts, lends the painting, and its message about the nobility of patriotic sacrifice, an electric intensity. This is all in contrast to the tender-hearted women who lie weeping and mourning, awaiting the results of the fighting.\n\nThe mother and sisters are shown clothed in silken garments seemingly melting into tender expressions of sorrow. Their despair is partly due to the fact that one sister was engaged to one of the Curiatii and another is a sister of the Curiatii, married to one of the Horatii. Upon defeat of the Curiatii, the remaining Horatius journeyed home to find his sister cursing Rome over the death of her fiancé. He killed her, horrified that Rome was being cursed. Originally David had intended to depict this episode, and a drawing survives showing the surviving Horatius raising his sword, with his sister lying dead. David later decided that this subject was too gruesome a way of sending the message of public duty overcoming private feeling, but his next major painting, \"The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons\" depicted a similar scene - Lucius Junius Brutus brooding as the bodies of his sons, whose executions for treason he had ordered, are returned home. This was a subject the tragedy \"Brutus\" by Voltaire had made familiar to the French. \nThe painting shows the three brothers on the left, the Horatii father in the center, and the three women along with two children on the right. The Horatii brothers are depicted swearing upon (saluting) their swords as they take their oath. The men show no sense of emotion. Even the father, who holds up three swords, shows no emotion. On the right, three women are weeping—one in the back and two up closer. The woman dressed in the white is a Horatius weeping for both her Curiatii fiancé and her brother; the one dressed in brown is a Curiatius who weeps for her Horatii husband and her brother. The background woman in black holds two children—one of whom is the child of a Horatius male and his Curiatii wife. The younger daughter hides her face in her nanny’s dress as the son refuses to have his eyes shielded.\nAccording to Thomas Le Claire:\n\nThis painting shows the neoclassical art style, and employs various techniques that were typical of it:\n\n\nWhen the royalty, churchmen, and aristocrats went to view the painting, they eulogised it; the Pope himself expressed his desire to view \"The Oath of the Horatii\". The painting was exhibited in the Salon of 1785, but it was delivered late. David's enemies at the Academy took advantage of the delay to exhibit the painting in a poor locale in the gallery. The public's dissatisfaction with the painting's poor viewing conditions obliged the gallery to move it to a more prominent location. David kept \"The Oath of the Horatii\" on exhibit for longer than expected to permit reporters to write about all of the paintings exhibited, not just his.\n"}
{"id": "31233043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31233043", "title": "Old Burmese", "text": "Old Burmese\n\nOld Burmese was an early form of the Burmese language, as attested in the stone inscriptions of Pagan, and is the oldest phase of Burmese linguistic history. The transition to Middle Burmese occurred in the 16th century. The transition to Middle Burmese included phonological changes (e.g. mergers of sound pairs that were distinct in Old Burmese) as well as accompanying changes in the underlying orthography. Word order, grammatical structure and vocabulary have remained markedly comparable, well into Modern Burmese, with the exception of lexical content (e.g. function words).\n\nUnlike most Tibeto-Burman languages, Burmese has a phonological system with two-way aspiration: preaspiration (e.g. \"hma.\" vs. \"ma.\") and postaspiration (e.g. \"kha.\" vs. \"ka.\"). In Burmese, this distinction serves to differentiate causative and non-causative verbs of Sino-Tibetan etymology.\n\nIn Old Burmese, postaspiration can be reconstructed to the proto-Burmese language, whereas preaspiration is comparatively newer, having derived from proto-prefixes. The merging of proto-prefixes (i.e., as an independent consonant used as a prefix) to preaspirated consonants was nearly complete by the 12th century.\n\nOld Burmese maintains a number of distinctions which are no longer present in the orthography of standard Burmese.\n\nWhereas Modern Standard Burmese uses 3 written medials (, , and ), Old Burmese had a fourth written medial , which was typically written as a stacked consonant underneath the letter being modified.\n\nOld Burmese orthography treated the preaspirated consonant as a separate segment, since a special diacritic (\"ha hto\", ) had not yet been innovated. As such, the letter \"ha\" () was stacked above the consonant being modified (e.g. where Modern Burmese uses ).\n\nExamples of such differences include the consonant \"yh-\" and the lateral clusters \"kl-\" and \"khl-\". The earliest Old Burmese documents, in particular the Myazedi and Lokatheikpan inscriptions frequently have \"-o-\" where later Burmese has \"-wa\". Old Burmese also had a final \"-at\" and \"-an\" distinct from \"-ac\" and \"-any\" as shown by Nishi (1974).\n\nAside from Pali, the Mon language had significant influence on Old Burmese orthography and vocabulary, as Old Burmese borrowed many lexical items (especially relating to handicrafts, administration, flora and fauna, navigation and architecture), although grammatical influence was minimal. Many Mon loan words are present in Old Burmese inscriptions, including words that were absent in the Burmese vocabulary and those that substituted original Burmese words. Examples include:\n\nMoreover, Mon influenced Old Burmese orthography, particularly with regard to preference for certain spelling conventions:\n\nTwo grammatical markers presently found in Modern Burmese are extant to Old Burmese: \n\nIn Old Burmese, was spelt \"ruy-e\", following the pattern in Pali, whose inflected verbs can express the main predicate.\n\nPali also had an influence in the construction of written Old Burmese verbal modifiers. Whereas in Modern Burmese, the verb + (\"sau:\") construction can only modify the succeeding noun (e.g. , \"man who loves\") and (\"su\") can only modify the preceding verb (e.g. , \"lover\"), in Old Burmese, both constructions, verb + and verb + were interchangeable. This was a consequence of Pali grammar, which dictates that participles can be used in noun functions.\n\nPali grammar also influenced negation in written Old Burmese, as many Old Burmese inscriptions adopt the Pali method of negation. In Burmese, negation is accomplished by prefixing a negative particle (\"ma.\") to the verb being negated. In Pali, (\"a.\") is used instead.\n\nSuch grammatical influences from Pali on written Old Burmese had disappeared by the 15th century.\n\nThe earliest evidence of Burmese script (inscription at the Mahabodhi Temple in India) is dated to 1035, while an 18th-century recast stone inscription points to 984. Perhaps the most well known inscription is the Old Burmese face of the Myazedi inscription. The most complete set of Old Burmese inscriptions, called \"She-haung Myanma Kyauksa Mya\" (; lit. \"Ancient Stone Inscriptions of Myanmar\") was published by Yangon University's Department of Archaeology in five volumes from 1972 to 1987.\n\n"}

OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision.\n\nEarly versions needed to be trained with images of each character, and worked on one font at a time. Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common, and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs. Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images, columns, and other non-textual components.\n\nEarly optical character recognition may be traced to technologies involving telegraphy and creating reading devices for the blind. In 1914, Emanuel Goldberg developed a machine that read characters and converted them into standard telegraph code. Concurrently, Edmund Fournier d'Albe developed the Optophone, a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page, produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or characters.\n\nIn the late 1920s and into the 1930s Emanuel Goldberg developed what he called a \"Statistical Machine\" for searching microfilm archives using an optical code recognition system. In 1931 he was granted USA Patent number 1,838,389 for the invention. The patent was acquired by IBM.\n\nWith the advent of smart-phones and smartglasses, OCR can be used in internet connected mobile device applications that extract text captured using the device's camera. These devices that do not have OCR functionality built into the operating system will typically use an OCR API to extract the text from the image file captured and provided by the device. The OCR API returns the extracted text, along with information about the location of the detected text in the original image back to the device app for further processing (such as text-to-speech) or display.\n\nIn 1974, Ray Kurzweil started the company Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. and continued development of omni-font OCR, which could recognise text printed in virtually any font (Kurzweil is often credited with inventing omni-font OCR, but it was in use by companies, including CompuScan, in the late 1960s and 1970s). Kurzweil decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine for the blind, which would allow blind people to have a computer read text to them out loud. This device required the invention of two enabling technologiesthe CCD flatbed scanner and the text-to-speech synthesiser. On January 13, 1976, the successful finished product was unveiled during a widely reported news conference headed by Kurzweil and the leaders of the National Federation of the Blind. In 1978, Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program. LexisNexis was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload legal paper and news documents onto its nascent online databases. Two years later, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox, which had an interest in further commercialising paper-to-computer text conversion. Xerox eventually spun it off as Scansoft, which merged with Nuance Communications. The research group headed by A. G. Ramakrishnan at the Medical intelligence and language engineering lab, Indian Institute of Science, has developed PrintToBraille tool, an open source GUI frontend that can be used by any OCR to convert scanned images of printed books to Braille books.\n\nIn the 2000s, OCR was made available online as a service (WebOCR), in a cloud computing environment, and in mobile applications like real-time translation of foreign-language signs on a smartphone.\n\nVarious commercial and open source OCR systems are available for most common writing systems, including Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Bengali (Bangla), Devanagari, Tamil, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.\n\nOCR engines have been developed into many kinds of domain-specific OCR applications, such as receipt OCR, invoice OCR, check OCR, legal billing document OCR.\n\nThey can be used for:\n\n\nOCR is generally an \"offline\" process, which analyses a static document. Handwriting movement analysis can be used as input to handwriting recognition. Instead of merely using the shapes of glyphs and words, this technique is able to capture motions, such as the order in which segments are drawn, the direction, and the pattern of putting the pen down and lifting it. This additional information can make the end-to-end process more accurate. This technology is also known as \"on-line character recognition\", \"dynamic character recognition\", \"real-time character recognition\", and \"intelligent character recognition\".\n\nOCR software often \"pre-processes\" images to improve the chances of successful recognition. Techniques include:\n\nSegmentation of fixed-pitch fonts is accomplished relatively simply by aligning the image to a uniform grid based on where vertical grid lines will least often intersect black areas. For proportional fonts, more sophisticated techniques are needed because whitespace between letters can sometimes be greater than that between words, and vertical lines can intersect more than one character.\n\nThere are two basic types of core OCR algorithm, which may produce a ranked list of candidate characters.\n\nMatrix matching involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixel-by-pixel basis; it is also known as \"pattern matching\", \"pattern recognition\", or \"image correlation\". This relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image, and on the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale. This technique works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered. This is the technique the early physical photocell-based OCR implemented, rather directly.\n\nFeature extraction decomposes glyphs into \"features\" like lines, closed loops, line direction, and line intersections. The extraction features reduces the dimensionality of the representation and makes the recognition process computationally efficient. These features are compared with an abstract vector-like representation of a character, which might reduce to one or more glyph prototypes. General techniques of feature detection in computer vision are applicable to this type of OCR, which is commonly seen in \"intelligent\" handwriting recognition and indeed most modern OCR software. Nearest neighbour classifiers such as the k-nearest neighbors algorithm are used to compare image features with stored glyph features and choose the nearest match.\n\nSoftware such as Cuneiform and Tesseract use a two-pass approach to character recognition. The second pass is known as \"adaptive recognition\" and uses the letter shapes recognised with high confidence on the first pass to recognise better the remaining letters on the second pass. This is advantageous for unusual fonts or low-quality scans where the font is distorted (e.g. blurred or faded).\n\nThe OCR result can be stored in the standardised ALTO format, a dedicated XML schema maintained by the United States Library of Congress.\n\nFor a list of optical character recognition software see Comparison of optical character recognition software.\n\nOCR accuracy can be increased if the output is constrained by a lexicona list of words that are allowed to occur in a document. This might be, for example, all the words in the English language, or a more technical lexicon for a specific field. This technique can be problematic if the document contains words not in the lexicon, like proper nouns. Tesseract uses its dictionary to influence the character segmentation step, for improved accuracy.\n\nThe output stream may be a plain text stream or file of characters, but more sophisticated OCR systems can preserve the original layout of the page and produce, for example, an annotated PDF that includes both the original image of the page and a searchable textual representation.\n\n\"Near-neighbor analysis\" can make use of co-occurrence frequencies to correct errors, by noting that certain words are often seen together. For example, \"Washington, D.C.\" is generally far more common in English than \"Washington DOC\".\n\nKnowledge of the grammar of the language being scanned can also help determine if a word is likely to be a verb or a noun, for example, allowing greater accuracy.\n\nThe Levenshtein Distance algorithm has also been used in OCR post-processing to further optimize results from an OCR API.\n\nIn recent years, the major OCR technology providers began to tweak OCR systems to better deal with specific types of input. Beyond an application-specific lexicon, better performance can be had by taking into account business rules, standard expression, or rich information contained in color images. This strategy is called \"Application-Oriented OCR\" or \"Customised OCR\", and has been applied to OCR of license plates, invoices, screenshots, ID cards, driver licenses, and automobile manufacturing.\n\nThere are several techniques for solving the problem of character recognition by means other than improved OCR algorithms.\n\nSpecial fonts like OCR-A, OCR-B, or MICR fonts, with precisely specified sizing, spacing, and distinctive character shapes, allow a higher accuracy rate during transcription in bank check processing. Ironically however, several prominent OCR engines were designed to capture text in popular fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman, and are incapable of capturing text in these fonts that are specialized and much different from popularly used fonts. As Google Tesseract can be trained to recognize new fonts, it can recognize OCR-A, OCR-B and MICR fonts.\n\n\"Comb fields\" are pre-printed boxes that encourage humans to write more legiblyone glyph per box. These are often printed in a \"dropout color\" which can be easily removed by the OCR system.\n\nPalm OS used a special set of glyphs, known as \"Graffiti\" which are similar to printed English characters but simplified or modified for easier recognition on the platform's computationally limited hardware. Users would need to learn how to write these special glyphs.\n\nZone-based OCR restricts the image to a specific part of a document. This is often referred to as \"Template OCR\".\n\nCrowdsourcing humans to perform the character recognition can quickly process images like computer-driven OCR, but with higher accuracy for recognising images than is obtained with computers. Practical systems include the Amazon Mechanical Turk and reCAPTCHA. The National Library of Finland has developed an online interface for users correct OCRed texts in the standardised ALTO format. Crowdsourcing has also been used not to perform character recognition directly but to invite software developers to develop image processing algorithms, for example, through the use of rank-order tournaments.\n\nCommissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Information Science Research Institute (ISRI) had the mission to foster the improvement of automated technologies for understanding machine printed documents, and it conducted the most authoritative of the \"Annual Test of OCR Accuracy\" from 1992 to 1996.\n\nRecognition of Latin-script, typewritten text is still not 100% accurate even where clear imaging is available. One study based on recognition of 19th- and early 20th-century newspaper pages concluded that character-by-character OCR accuracy for commercial OCR software varied from 81% to 99%; total accuracy can be achieved by human review or Data Dictionary Authentication. Other areas—including recognition of hand printing, cursive handwriting, and printed text in other scripts (especially those East Asian language characters which have many strokes for a single character)—are still the subject of active research. The MNIST database is commonly used for testing systems' ability to recognise handwritten digits.\n\nAccuracy rates can be measured in several ways, and how they are measured can greatly affect the reported accuracy rate. For example, if word context (basically a lexicon of words) is not used to correct software finding non-existent words, a character error rate of 1% (99% accuracy) may result in an error rate of 5% (95% accuracy) or worse if the measurement is based on whether each whole word was recognised with no incorrect letters.\n\nAn example of the difficulties inherent in digitising old text is the inability of OCR to differentiate between the \"long s\" and \"f\" characters.\n\nWeb-based OCR systems for recognising hand-printed text on the fly have become well known as commercial products in recent years (see Tablet PC history). Accuracy rates of 80% to 90% on neat, clean hand-printed characters can be achieved by pen computing software, but that accuracy rate still translates to dozens of errors per page, making the technology useful only in very limited applications.\n\nRecognition of cursive text is an active area of research, with recognition rates even lower than that of hand-printed text. Higher rates of recognition of general cursive script will likely not be possible without the use of contextual or grammatical information. For example, recognising entire words from a dictionary is easier than trying to parse individual characters from script. Reading the \"Amount\" line of a cheque (which is always a written-out number) is an example where using a smaller dictionary can increase recognition rates greatly. The shapes of individual cursive characters themselves simply do not contain enough information to accurately (greater than 98%) recognise all handwritten cursive script. \n\nMost programs allow users to set \"confidence rates\". This means that if the software does not achieve their desired level of accuracy, a user can be notified for manual review.\n\nCharacters to support OCR were added to the Unicode Standard in June 1993, with the release of version 1.1.\n\nSome of these characters are mapped from fonts specific to MICR, OCR-A or OCR-B.\n\n"}

{"id": "7237054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7237054", "title": "Pipil language", "text": "Pipil language\n\nPipil (natively Nawat) is a Uto-Toltec or Uto-Nicarao language of the Uto-Aztecan family, which stretches from Utah in the United States down through El Salvador to Nicaragua in Central America. The name of the language family was created to show that it includes the greatest extent perimeter from the Ute language of Utah, to the former Toltec predecessor and the expanse margin Pipil-Nicarao successors, which was spoken in several parts of present-day Central America before the Spanish conquest. Although it has been on the verge of extinction in western El Salvador and has already gone extinct elsewhere in Central America, as of 2012, new second language speakers are starting to appear.\n\nIn El Salvador, Nawat was the language of several tribes: Nonualcos, Cuscatlecos, Mazahuas, and Izalcos. The name \"Pipil\" for this language is used by the international scholarly community, chiefly to differentiate it more clearly from Nahuatl. In this article the name \"Nawat\" will be used whenever there is no risk of ambiguity.\n\nMost authors refer to this language by the names \"Pipil\" or \"Nawat\". However, \"Nawat\" (along with the synonymous \"Eastern Nahuatl\") has also been used to refer to Nahuatl language varieties in southern Veracruz, Tabasco, and Chiapas, states in the south of Mexico, that like Pipil have reduced the earlier /t͡ɬ/ consonant (a lateral affricate) to a /t/. Those Mexican lects share more similarities with Nawat than do the other Nahuatl varieties.\n\nPipil specialists (Campbell, Fidias Jiménez, Geoffroy Rivas, King, Lemus, and Schultze, \"inter alia\") generally treat Pipil/Nawat as a separate language, at least in practice. Lastra de Suárez (1986) and Canger (1988) classify Pipil among \"Eastern Periphery\" dialects of Nahuatl.\n\n\nUto-Aztecan is uncontroversially divided into eight branches, including Nahuan. Research continues into verifying higher level groupings. However, the grouping adopted by Campbell of the four southernmost branches is not yet universally accepted.\n\nAs of 2012, extensive online resources for learning Nawat are available at the website of linguist Alan R. King, including video lessons and a Facebook group. A video documentation project is also underway, in collaboration with the Living Tongues Institute, focusing on \"Pipil culture, such as natural medicines, traditions, traditional games, agricultural practices, and childhood songs,\" which is intended for language learners.\n\nThe varieties of Nawat in Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama are now extinct. In El Salvador, Nawat is endangered: it is spoken mostly by a few elderly speakers in the Salvadoran departments of Sonsonate and Ahuachapán. The towns of Cuisnahuat and Santo Domingo de Guzmán have the highest concentration of speakers. Campbell's 1985 estimate (based on fieldwork conducted 1970–1976) was 200 speakers. Gordon (2005) reports only 20 speakers were left in 1987. Official Mexican reports have recorded as many as 2000 speakers.\n\nThe exact number of speakers has been difficult to determine because persecution of Pipil speakers throughout the 20th century (massacres after suppression of the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising, laws that made speaking Nawat illegal) made them conceal their use of the language. (About 30,000 people were killed during the uprising over the course of a few weeks, and those who spoke Nawat outside their homes against the new rules \"provoked shame and fear.\" A young Nawat language activist, Carlos Cortez, explained in 2010 that this fear is worse for older speakers.)\n\nA few small-scale projects to revitalize Nawat in El Salvador have been attempted since 1990. The Asociación Coordinadora de Comunidades Indígenas de El Salvador (ACCIES ) and Universidad Don Bosco of San Salvador have both produced some teaching materials. Monica Ward has developed an on-line language course. The Nawat Language Recovery Initiative is a grassroots association currently engaged in several activities including an ongoing language documentation project, and has also produced a range of printed materials. Thus, as the number of native speakers continues to dwindle, there is growing interest in some quarters in keeping the language alive, but as of 2002, the national government had not joined these efforts (cf. Various, 2002).\n\nAs of 2010, the town of Santo Domingo de Guzman had a language nest, “Xuchikisa nawat” (\"the house where Nawat blooms\"), where children three to five years of age learned Nawat, run in cooperation with Don Bosco University.\n\nIn 2010, Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes awarded the National Culture Prize (Premio Nacional de Cultura 2010) to linguist Dr. Jorge Ernesto Lemus of Don Bosco University for his work with Nawat.\n\nAccording to a 2009 report in \"El Diario de Hoy,\" Nawat had started to make a comeback as a result of the preservation and revitalization efforts of various non-profit organizations in conjunction with several universities, combined with a post-civil war resurgence of Pipil identity in El Salvador. In the 1980s, Nawat had about 200 speakers. By 2009, 3,000 people were participating in Nawat language learning programs, the vast majority being young people, giving rise to hopes that the language might be pulled back from the brink of extinction.\n\nLocalities where Pipil was reported by Campbell as spoken in the 1970s include the following:\n\nGordon (2009) lists Dolores as a Pipil-speaking area. Kaufman (1970:66) lists Escuintla and Comapa as former Pipil-speaking areas of Guatemala, and San Agustín Acasaguastlán as a former \"Mejicano\"-speaking town. The genetic position of San Agustín Acasaguastlán Mejicano is still uncertain (\"see Alagüilac language\"). However, Nahuan languages are currently no longer spoken in Guatemala.\n\nTwo salient features of Pipil are found in several Mexican dialects: the change of [t͡ɬ] to [t] and [u] rather than [o] as the predominant allophone of a single basic rounded vowel phoneme. These features are thus characteristic but not diagnostic.\n\nHowever, Pipil corresponds to not only the two Classical Nahuatl sounds and but also a word final \"saltillo\" or glottal stop in nominal plural suffixes (e.g. Pipil \"-met\" : Classical \"-meh\") and verbal plural endings (Pipil \"-t\" present plural, \"-ket\" past plural, etc.). This fact has been claimed by Campbell to be diagnostic for the position of Pipil in a genetic classification, on the assumption that this /t/ is more archaic than the Classical Nahuatl reflex, where the direction change has been > \"saltillo\".\n\nOne other characteristic phonological feature is the merger in Pipil of original geminate with single .\n\nPipil lacks some grammatical features present in Classical Nahuatl, such as the past prefix \"o-\" in verbs. It distributes others differently: for example, 'subtractive' past formation, which is very common in the classical language, exists in Pipil but is much rarer. On the other hand, reduplication to form plural nouns, of more limited distribution in the language of the Aztecs, is greatly generalised in Pipil. Still other grammatical features that were productive in Classical Nahuatl have left only fossilised traces in Pipil: for example, synchronically Pipil has no postpositions, although a few lexical forms derive etymologically from older postpositional forms, e.g. \"apan\" 'river' < *'in/on the water', \"kujtan\" 'uncultivated land, forest' < *'under the trees'; these are synchronically unanalyzable in modern Pipil.\n\nPipil has developed two widely used articles, definite \"ne\" and indefinite \"se\". The demonstrative pronouns/determiners \"ini\" 'this, these' and \"uni\" 'that, those' are also distinctively Pipil in form. The obligatory marking of number extends in Pipil to almost all plural noun phrases (regardless of animacy), which will contain at least one plural form, most commonly marked by reduplication.\n\nMany nouns are invariable for state, since \"-ti\" (cf. Classical \"-tli\", the absolute suffix after consonants) is rarely added to polysyllabic noun stems, while the Classical postconsonantal construct suffix, \"-wi\", is altogether unknown in Pipil: thus \"sin-ti\" 'maize' : \"nu-sin\" 'my maize', \"uj-ti\" 'way' : \"nu-uj\" 'my way', \"mistun\" 'cat' : \"nu-mistun\" 'my cat'.\n\nAn important number of nouns lack absolute forms and occur only inalienably possessed, e.g. \"nu-mey\" 'my hand' (but not *\"mey\" or *\"mey-ti\"), \"nu-nan\" 'my mother' (but not *\"nan\" or *\"nan-ti\"), thus further reducing the number of absolute-construct oppositions and the incidence of absolute \"-ti\" in comparison to Classical Nahuatl.\n\nPostpositions have been eliminated from the Pipil grammatical system, and some monosyllabic prepositions originating from relationals have become grammaticalized.\n\nTo form the past tense, most Pipil verbs add \"-k\" (after vowels) or \"-ki\" (after consonants, following loss of the final vowel of the present stem), e.g. \"ki-neki\" 'he wants it' : \"ki-neki-k\" 'he wanted it', \"ki-mati\" 'he knows it' : \"ki-mat-ki\" 'he knew it'. The mechanism of simply removing the present stem vowel to form past stems, so common in Classical Nahuatl, is limited in Pipil to polysyllabic verb stems such as \"ki-talia\" 'he puts it' → \"ki-tali(j)\" 'he put it', \"mu-talua\" 'he runs' → \"mu-talu(j)\" 'he ran', and a handful of other verbs, e.g. \"ki-tajtani\" 'he asks him' → \"ki-tajtan\" 'he asked him'.\n\nPipil has a perfect in \"-tuk\" (synchronically unanalyzable), plural \"-tiwit\". Another tense suffix, \"-tuya\", functions both as a pluperfect (\"k-itz-tuya ne takat\" 'he had seen the man') and as an imperfect of stative verbs (\"inte weli-tuya\" 'he couldn't'), in the latter case having supplanted the \"-ya\" imperfect found in Mexican dialects.\n\nPipil has two conditional tenses, one in \"-skia\" expressing possible conditions and possible results, and one in \"-tuskia\" for impossible ones, although the distinction is sometimes blurred in practice. A future tense in \"-s\" (plural \"-sket\") is attested but rarely used, a periphrastic future being preferred, e.g. \"yawi witz\" (or \"yu-witz\") 'he will come'.\n\nIn serial constructions, the present tense (really the unmarked tense) is generally found except in the first verb, regardless of the tense of the latter, e.g. \"kineki / kinekik / kinekiskia kikwa\" 'he wants / wanted / would like to eat it'.\n\nThere are also some differences regarding how prefixes are attached to verb-initial stems; principally, that in Pipil the prefixes \"ni-\", \"ti-\", \"shi-\" and \"ki-\" when word-initial retain their \"i\" in most cases, e.g. \"ni-ajsi\" 'I arrive', \"ki-elkawa\" 'he forgets it'.\n\n\n\n"}

Beginning in 1922 she published a variety of works in Yiddish, including nature poetry, short stories, children's stories, and translations of Polish works. In 1924, she moved to Łódź, which at the time had the Poland's second-largest population of Jews and was a center of modernist experimentation. She married poet Khayim-Leyb Fuks (1897–1953) and they had a daughter, Avivit, in 1926. She first came to widespread attention after the inclusion of four of her poems in Ezra Korman's \"Yidishe dikhterins: antologye\" (\"Yiddish Women Poets: Anthology\", 1928). Her first collection of poetry, \"Vint oyf klavishn\" (\"Wind on Keys\"), was published in Łódź in 1934.

{"id": "1257977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1257977", "title": "Stunting (broadcasting)", "text": "Stunting (broadcasting)\n\nIn radio broadcasting, stunting occurs when a station abruptly airs content that is seemingly uncharacteristic compared to what they normally play. The tactic is commonly used when a station is about to undergo a major change (such as a change in format, branding, frequency, ownership or management, or even the acquisition of a high-profile program or personality), or simply as a prank on listeners and rival broadcasters. Either way, stunting is intended as a way to generate a greater amount of media publicity and audience attention to the station, by virtue of its shock value, than a straightforward format change could provide. Depending on the station's situation and its management's preference, stunt formats can last anywhere from a few minutes to several weeks before the permanent change is launched.\n\nA station may stunt by repeating the same song or songs over and over on a continuous loop, sometimes hinting towards the new format.\n\nIn a prelude to a format flip, a series of audio clips and sound effects centered around a certain theme may be played. Known as a sound collage, the theme under which these bits of audio fall may or may not have something to do with the previous and/or new format.\n\nWhen changing formats, a station may be upfront about the nature of the new format by using a limited playlist of songs or highlights of the new format, an approach intended to preview what to expect after the format change takes place.\n\nOccasionally a station dropping an old format will stunt with a temporary transitional format, one intended to tease not so much the listener but competing stations who are not privy to the station's new plans. The fake format, more often than not, is only intended as a transition to a new format or existing format adjustment. A similar, but smaller, effect can be produced by registering numerous domain names suggesting various formats, in an effort to throw off \"net gnomes\" and generate buzz.\n\nA station may stunt by temporarily formatting a series of novelty songs, a song style that usually wouldn't support itself as a stand-alone commercial radio format.\n\nA station may mix musical selections from both its old and new formats for a period of time. This smooth transition works best if the formats have little to no normal overlap in their playlists, such as a shift from country music to rhythmic contemporary or alternative rock; it may not be as effective or obvious if the transition is from, for example, modern rock to alternative rock. This type of stunting does not occur as often as other forms, as the approach does not increase the shock and anticipation value as much as with the other forms.\n\nThe popular practice of radio stations playing Christmas music during the lead-up to (and occasionally the week after) Christmas Day has also been used as a means of transitioning to a new format, either following the conclusion of this programming, or in some cases, prematurely interrupting it instead.\n\nIn a similar spirit to ironic \"Christmas in July\" promotions, such a stunt can also occur outside of the holiday season.\n\n\nRadio-like stunts on television are not as commonplace as they are on radio, usually due to iron-clad programming commitments, a general lack of concrete formats in television (especially among local television stations, which still mostly use a homogenized and daypart-driven block programming strategy), and a lower level of shock value in a multichannel universe. \n\nInstead, a TV station or network may stunt in the form of a heavily-promoted event, as in the case of promoting new on-air branding, station affiliation change, or acquisition of programming or personnel; an increase in publicity (and with it, the station hopes, viewer anticipation) will increase as the changeover date nears. A prime example of this promo-type stunting involved British cable channel Bravo, which in January 1997 used a series of eerily-produced promos to herald a change in programming tone (including mutations of the network's old and new visual presentations). Marathons, the sequential broadcast of several episodes of the same series, are quite common during network transitions.\n\nAt least two networks have used stunting-type events prior to their formal launches. MLB Network, for example, aired a continuous loop of baseball highlights and promos as a \"soft launch\" in the weeks before its formal debut on January 1, 2009, while Canada's Sun News Network employed an on-screen countdown clock graphic in the hours before its April 18, 2011 launch.\n\nNick Jr. Too, a sister to the British Nick Jr. channel, has occasionally aired long-term marathons of \"Peppa Pig\", during which it has branded as \"Nick Jr. Peppa\".\n"}

This type of landscaping is therefore called terracing. Graduated terrace steps are commonly used to farm on hilly or mountainous terrain. Terraced fields decrease both erosion and surface runoff, and may be used to support growing crops that require irrigation, such as rice. The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras have been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of the significance of this technique.\n\nTerraced paddy fields are used widely in rice, wheat and barley farming in east, south, and southeast Asia, as well as the Mediterranean, Africa, and South America. Drier-climate terrace farming is common throughout the Mediterranean Basin, where they are used for vineyards, olive trees, cork oak, etc.\n\nIn the South American Andes, farmers have used terraces, known as \"andenes,\" for over a thousand years to farm potatoes, maize, and other native crops. Terraced farming was developed by the Wari culture and other peoples of the south-central Andes before 1000 AD, centuries before they were used by the Inca, who adopted them. The terraces were built to make the most efficient use of shallow soil and to enable irrigation of crops by allowing runoff to occur through the outlet.\n\nThe Inca built on these, developing a system of canals, aqueducts, and puquios to direct water through dry land and increase fertility levels and growth. These terraced farms are found wherever mountain villages have existed in the Andes. They provided the food necessary to support the populations of great Inca cities and religious centres such as Machu Picchu.\n\nTerracing is also used for sloping terrain; the Hanging Gardens of Babylon may have been built on an artificial mountain with stepped terraces, such as those on a ziggurat. At the seaside Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum, the villa gardens of Julius Caesar's father-in-law were designed in terraces to give pleasant and varied views of the Bay of Naples.\n\nTerraced fields are common in islands with steep slopes. The Canary Islands present a complex system of terraces covering the landscape from the coastal irrigated plantations to the dry fields in the highlands. These terraces, which are named \"cadenas\" (chains), are built with stone walls of skillful design, which include attached stairs and channels.\n\nIn Old English, a terrace was also called a \"lynch\" (lynchet). An example of an ancient Lynch Mill is in Lyme Regis. The water is directed from a river by a duct along a terrace. This set-up was used in steep hilly areas in the UK.\n\nIn Japan, some of the \"100 Selected Terraced Rice Fields\" (in Japanese: ), from Iwate in the north to Kagoshima in the south, are slowly disappearing, but volunteers are helping the farmers for keeping their tradition and/or for the sightseeing purpose. \n\n\n"}

Moreover, the lexicon of certain Tharu households is indicative of an archaic, 'indigenous' substratum, potentially predating both Sino-Tibetan or Indo-Aryan settlement. Moreover, Tharu languages appear to be transitional within the context of Indo-Aryan. \n\nChitwania Tharu is spoken by approximately 250,000 speakers east of the Gandaki River, in and around the Chitwan Valley. Chitwania, as a whole, has superficial similarities with Awadhi.

Furthermore, an additional variant of Tharu, known as Sonha, is largely mutually intelligible with Dangauru.\n\nKochila, a diverse Tharu variant, is also spoken by approximately 250,000 people, in regions of eastern Nepal.

The seemingly contradictory phrase is used to simultaneously announce the death of the previous monarch and assure the public of continuity by saluting the new monarch.\n\nIn modern times, this phrase has become a popular phrasal template. Given the memorable nature of the phrase (owing to epanalepsis), as well as its historic significance, the phrase crops up regularly as a headline for articles, editorials, or advertisements on themes of succession or replacement. Robert Cecil, one of the architects of the League of Nations, famously concluded his speech at the final session of the League of Nations with the phrase: \"The League is dead. Long live the United Nations.\"\nThe Platypus Affiliated, a campus-based educational organization centered on Marxism, uses the slogan \"The Left is dead! Long live the Left!\" \n\nThe original phrase was translated from the French , which was first declared upon the accession to the French throne of Charles VII after the death of his father Charles VI in 1422. In France, the declaration was traditionally made by the duc d'Uzès, a senior peer of France, as soon as the coffin containing the remains of the previous king descended into the vault of Saint Denis Basilica. The phrase arose from the law of —that the transfer of sovereignty occurs instantaneously upon the moment of death of the previous monarch. \"The King is dead\" is the announcement of a monarch who has just died. \"Long live The King!\" refers to the heir who immediately succeeds to a throne upon the death of the preceding monarch.\n\nAt the time, French was the primary language of the nobility in England, and the proclamation was quickly taken up as ideally representing the same tradition—which in England dates back to 1272, when Henry III died while his son, Edward I, was fighting in the Crusades. To avoid any chance of a civil war erupting over the order of succession, the Royal Council proclaimed: \"The throne shall never be empty; the country shall never be without a monarch.\" Thus, Edward was declared king immediately, and he reigned \"in absentia\" until news of his father's death reached him and he returned to England. Another example is among the French royalty. In France, Louis XV was the predecessor of Louis XVI. Upon Louis XV's death at around 11:00 pm on 10 May 1774, heir-apparent Louis-Auguste, le Dauphin, immediately became King Louis XVI of France. This quick transition of sovereignty was made within the phrase \"The King is dead, long live The King!\"\n\nIn Denmark, the prime minister makes a similar proclamation upon the death of a monarch—\"Kongen leve, kongen er død\" (hail the king, the king is dead)—from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace (the Danish Parliament building). This declaration is official and marks the ascension of a new monarch immediately after the death of the old. This is due to the fact that Frederick III abolished the coronation ceremony with the introduction of the hereditary and absolute monarchy in 1660. The king was now supreme and accountable only to God, so the crown became a birthright, and not something to be bestowed only after the father's death with the nobles and the church's approval. With the introduction of constitutional monarchy in 1849, the monarch's power over the State was again limited, but his claim to the throne remained undisputed and absolute.\n\nIn some monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, an interregnum is usually avoided by using the idea of immediate transferral of power behind the phrase (i.e., the heir to the throne becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor's death). This famous phrase signifies the continuity of sovereignty, attached to a personal form of power named \"Auctoritas\". This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch's reign begins only with coronation or some other formal or traditional event. In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth for instance, kings were elected, which often led to relatively long interregna. During that time it was the Polish primate who served as an interrex (ruler between kings). Ernst Kantorowicz's famous theory of \"the king's two bodies\" (1957) showed how \"auctoritas\" (Kantorowicz used the synonym term—here—of \"dignitas\") was transferred from the defunct sovereign to the new one.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and other realms which permit female succession to the throne, the phrase can be altered to accommodate succession between monarchs of different sexes, e.g. \"The King is dead, long live The Queen!\", as happened in 1952, when King George VI died and was succeeded by his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, or \"The Queen is dead, long live The King!\" as happened in 1901, when Queen Victoria was succeeded by her son, King Edward VII. \"The King is dead, long live The King!\" was last properly used in the United Kingdom in January 1936 when King George V was succeeded by his son King Edward VIII, who later abdicated, or \"The Queen is dead, long live The Queen!\" as happened in 1558, when Queen Mary I was succeeded by her half-sister, Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nIn the Kingdom of Thailand, to conclude the national televised address on October 13, 2016 regarding the passing of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the Prime Minister proclaimed \"His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Rama IX, has passed away. Long live His Majesty the new King.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "679361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=679361", "title": "Varietal", "text": "Varietal\n\nA varietal wine is a wine made primarily from a single named grape variety, and which typically displays the name of that variety on the wine label. Examples of grape varieties commonly used in varietal wines are Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Merlot. Wines that display the name of two or more varieties on their label, such as a Chardonnay-Viognier, are blends and not varietal wines. The term is frequently misused in place of vine variety; the term variety refers to the vine or grape while varietal refers to the wine produced by a variety.\n\nAs vintners and consumers have become aware of the characteristics of individual varieties of wine grapes, wines have also come to be identified by varietal names.\n\nThe term was popularized in the US by Maynard Amerine at the University of California, Davis after Prohibition seeking to encourage growers to choose optimal vine varieties, and later promoted by Frank Schoonmaker in the 1950s and 1960s, ultimately becoming widespread during the California wine boom of the 1970s. Varietal wines are commonly associated with New World wines in general, but there is also a long-standing tradition of varietal labelling in Germany and other German-influenced wine regions including Austria, Alsace, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe alternatives to the marketing differentiation of wines by grape variety are branded wine, such as Hearty Burgundy, or geographical appellations, such as Champagne or Bordeaux. The poor quality and unknown provenance of many branded wines and the multitude of potentially confusing appellations leaves varietal labeling as perhaps the most popular for quality wines in many markets. This is much less the case in places where appellations have a long and strong tradition, as for instance in France. In the past, the grape variety was very uncommonly mentioned on the labels of French wine bottles, and was forbidden for almost all AOC wines. New World varietal wines from newcomers like Australia and Chile have made a significant dent in traditional French export markets like the UK, and so the French are adopting varietal labeling in some cases, particularly for vin de pays. Also, in its own way, Chardonnay is now a powerful brand.\n\nAustralia has virtually completed a three decade long transition from labelling by style, e.g. \"claret\", \"burgundy\", \"hock\", \"chablis\" to a varietal system. While this has been done in response to pressure from the EU, particularly France, it has paved the way for growing interest among Australian consumers for so called alternative varietals, such as Pinot grigio / (Pinot gris), Sangiovese and Tempranillo.\n\nWithin the European Union, a wine using a varietal label must contain at least 85% of that variety. 85% is a common minimum standard; national regulations may set the limit higher in certain cases, but not lower.\n\nIn most regions of France, terroir is thought to surpass the impact of variety, so almost all French wines traditionally have no variety listed at all, and would in many cases not be allowed for AOC wines. Champagne, for instance, is typically a blend of Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier, but this is not indicated anywhere on the label. In Alsace, winemakers adopt the German custom of varietal labeling.\n\nIn recent years, varietal labels have become more common for French wines. Most of these wines are Vin de pays rather than AOC wines, but varietal names are also seen on some regional AOCs.\n\nIn the United States, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulations specify a minimum variety content of 75% of the labeled grape, for \"Vitis vinifera\" wines, and 51% for \"Vitis labrusca\" wines. There is no restriction on the identity of the balance. Many states in the United States require specific compositions to qualify for sale under a particular varietal labels. For example, in Oregon, wines subject to its regulation must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and certain varietals must contain at least 95% of that variety, although the new \"Southern Oregon\" sub-AVA allows for the minimum 75% figure.\n\n\n"}
