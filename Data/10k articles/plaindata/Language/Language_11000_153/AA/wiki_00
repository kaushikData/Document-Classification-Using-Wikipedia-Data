{"id": "31168371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31168371", "title": "Air Observation Post", "text": "Air Observation Post\n\nAir Observation Post (AOP) is an aeroplane or helicopter used in the role of artillery spotter by the Royal Air Force and other services of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth air forces. In this role, either the pilot of the aircraft or a passenger acts as an observer watching for targets on the ground, and/or as a Forward Observation Officer directing the fire, by radio, of artillery on the ground (or calling in tactical ground-attack aircraft).\n\nIn the interwar period, the role of artillery spotting was mixed with reconnaissance and ground attack to be served by Army Co-operation (AC) squadrons. At the beginning of World War II their standard aircraft was the Westland Lysander. This aircraft had a high level of losses with the British Expeditionary Force during the Battle of France (118 shot down out of a total of 175 deployed). This demonstrated the unsuitability of the Lysander for Army Co-operation and called into question the whole concept. These RAF squadrons converted to fighter-bomber aircraft by 1941, dropping the liaison and artillery spotting roles.\n\nThe first of the dedicated Air Observation Post units was established by Major Charles Bazeley of the Royal Artillery. Working as D flight of an RAF unit and equipped with the Auster, they went to France in February 1940 to develop the role on the French artillery ranges, in liaison with the French army. This training and development work had to be abandoned when the German blitzkrieg got underway and the unit was back at its UK base in Old Sarum by 20 May 1940. The flight had been ordered to disband, but the Army resisted this, and the intervention of General Alan Brook, who was Commander in Chief Home Forces at the time, was able to secure the future of the flight and the concept of the AOP.\n\nBy 1942, AOP squadrons 651, 652, and 653 were in existence. Ultimately the AOP units consisted of squadrons 651 to 663, with 664, 665 and 666 as RCAF units with both Canadian and British personnel.\n\nThe key difference from the Army Co-operation squadrons was that AOP pilots were from the Royal Artillery. The RAF provided the technicians to service the aircraft and the equipment officers and adjutants. The rest of each unit was provided by the army, including signalers and drivers. A further unusual feature of Air Observation Post squadrons was that all pilots were officers, and they were nearly all captains. Since most operations were carried out separately by individual flights, this lack of rank structure in squadrons tended not to produce problems.\n\nDuring World War II, British AOP units used light, fixed-wing aircraft, almost exclusively several marks of Auster aircraft. The low speed, high manoeuvrability, small size (so aiding concealment at front-line landing grounds) and light weight of the Auster made this a much more suitable aircraft than the Lysander. The standard tactic of dealing with enemy fighter aircraft was to fly very low around a hill or a wood. Casualty rates for AOP pilots turned out to be relatively low, certainly compared to RAF pilots or infantrymen. One source of losses in combat was the aircraft being hit whilst flying through the path of outgoing shells. This was a particular hazard in intense bombardments: four aircraft were lost in this way during the crossing of the Rhine in March 1945.\n\nIn 1957, the newly formed Army Air Corps was created from existing army units. Fixed wing aircraft were steadily replaced by helicopters.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4543915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4543915", "title": "Classification of Thracian", "text": "Classification of Thracian\n\nThe linguistic classification of the ancient Thracian language has long been a matter of contention and uncertainty, and there are widely varying hypotheses regarding its position among other Paleo-Balkan languages. It is not contested, however, that the Thracian languages were Indo-European languages which had acquired satem characteristics by the time they are attested.\n\nThe longer Thracian inscriptions that are known (if they are indeed examples of Thracian sentences and phrases, which has not been determined) are not apparently close to Baltic, Slavic, Albanian, or any other known language, and they have not been satisfactorily deciphered aside from perhaps a few words.\n\nA \"Daco-Thracian\" (or \"Thraco-Dacian\") grouping with Dacian as either the same language or different from Thracian was widely held until the 1950s, but is untenable (according to J. P. Mallory) in light of toponymic evidence: only a percent of place names north of the Danube betray \"pan-Thracian\" roots. The hypothesis of a Thraco-Dacian or Daco-Thracian branch of IE, indicating a close link between the Thracian and Dacian languages, has numerous adherents, including Russu 1967, Georg Solta 1980, Vraciu 1980, Crossland, Trask (2000), McHenry (1993), Mihailov (2008). Crossland (1982) considers that the divergence of a presumed original Thraco-Dacian language into northern and southern groups of dialects is not so significant as to rank them as separate languages. According to Georg Solta (1982), there is no significant difference between Dacian and Thracian. Rădulescu (1984) accepts that Daco-Moesian possesses a certain degree of dialectal individuality, but argues that there is no fundamental separation between Daco-Moesian and Thracian. Crossland considers this seems to be a divergence of a Thraco-Dacian language into northern and southern groups of dialects, not as different as to rank as separate languages. Polomé (1982) considers that the evidence presented by Georgiev and Duridanov, although substantial, is not sufficient to determine whether Daco-Moesian and Thracian were two dialects of the same language or two distinct languages.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Bulgarian linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev published his work which argued that Dacian and Albanian should be assigned to a language branch termed \"Daco-Mysian\", Mysian (the term \"Mysian\" derives from the Daco-Thracian tribe known as the \"Moesi\") being thought of as a transitional language between Dacian and Thracian. Georgiev argued that Dacian and Thracian are different languages, with different phonetic systems, his idea being supported by the placenames, which end in \"-dava\" in Dacian and Mysian, as opposed to \"-para\", in Thracian placenames. Georgiev argues that the distance between Dacian and Thracian was approximately the same as that between the Armenian and Persian languages. The claim of Georgiev that Albanian is a direct recent descendant of Daco-Moesian, not only a part of the branch, is highly based on speculations as suffixes from Dacian toponyms as Dava, for example, are lacking in modern Albanian toponymy (with one exception).\n\nThe Baltic classification of Dacian and Thracian has been proposed by the Lithuanian polymath Jonas Basanavičius, referred to as \"Patriarch of Lithuania\", who insisted this is the most important work of his life and listed 600 identical words of Balts and Thracians and was the first to investigate similarities in vocal traditions between Lithuanians and Bulgarians. He also theoretically included Dacian and Phrygian in the related group, but a part of this inclusion was unsupported by other authors, such as the linguistic analysis of Ivan Duridanov, which found Phrygian completely lacking parallels in either Thracian or Baltic languages.\n\nThe Bulgarian linguist Ivan Duridanov, in his first publication claimed that Thracian and Dacian are genetically linked to the Baltic languages and in the next one he made the following classification: \"The Thracian language formed a close group with the Baltic (resp. Balto-Slavic), the Dacian and the 'Pelasgian' languages. More distant were its relations with the other Indo-European languages, and especially with Greek, the Italic and Celtic languages, which exhibit only isolated phonetic similarities with Thracian; the Tokharian and the Hittite were also distant.\" Of about 200 reconstructed Thracian words by Duridanov, most cognates (138) appear in the Baltic languages, mostly in Lithuanian, followed by Germanic (61), Indo-Aryan (41), Greek (36), Bulgarian (23), Latin (10) and Albanian (8). The use of toponyms is suggested to determine the extent of a culture's influence. Parallels have enabled linguists, using the techniques of comparative linguistics, to decipher the meanings of several Dacian and Thracian placenames with, they claim, a high degree of probability. Of 300 attested Thracian geographic names most parallels were found between Thracian and Baltic and geographic names in the study of Duridanov. According to him the most important impression make the geographic cognates of Baltic and Thracian \"the similarity of these parallels stretching frequently on the main element and the suffix simultaneously, which makes a strong impression\". He also reconstructed Dacian words and Dacian placenames and found parallels mostly in the Baltic languages, followed by Albanian. Other Slavic authors noted that Dacian and Thracian have much in common with Baltic onomastics and explicitly not in any similar way with Slavic onomastics, including cognates and parallels of lexical isoglosses, which implies a recent common ancestor.\n\nAfter creating a list of names of rivers and personal names with a high number of parallels, the Romanian linguist Mircea M. Radulescu classified the Daco-Moesian and Thracian as Baltic languages, result of Baltic expansion to the south and also proposed such classification for Illyrian.\n\nThe Venezuelan-Lithuanian historian Jurate Rosales classifies Dacian and Thracian as Baltic languages.\n\nThe American linguist Harvey Mayer refers to both Dacian and Thracian as Baltic languages and refers to them as Southern or Eastern Baltic. He claims to have sufficient evidence for classifying them as Baltoidic or at least \"Baltic-like\", if not exactly, Baltic dialects or languages and classifies Dacians and Thracians as \"Balts by extension\". Mayer claims that he extracted an unambiguous evidence for regarding Dacian and Thracian as more tied to Lithuanian than to Latvian. \nThraco-Illyrian is a hypothesis that the Thraco-Dacian and Illyrian languages comprise a distinct branch of Indo-European. Thraco-Illyrian is also used as a term merely implying a Thracian-Illyrian interference, mixture or sprachbund, or as a shorthand way of saying that it is not determined whether a subject is to be considered as pertaining to Thracian or Illyrian. Downgraded to a geo-linguistic concept, these languages are referred to as Paleo-Balkan.\n\nThe rivers Vardar and Morava are generally taken as the rough line of demarcation between the Illyrian sphere on the west and Thracian on the east. There is, however, much interference in the area between Illyrian and Thracian, with Thracian groups inhabiting Illyrian lands (the Thracian Bryges for example) and Illyrian groups overlapping into the Thracian zone (the Dardani seem to be a Thraco-Illyrian mix; Wilkes, 1992 \"et al.\"). It appears that Thracian and Illyrian do not have a clear-cut frontier. Similarities found between the Illyrian and Thracian lexis can thus be seen as merely linguistic interference.\n\nOthers such as I.I. Russu argue that there should have been major similarities between Illyrian and Thracian, and a common linguistic branch (not merely a Sprachbund) is probable. Among the Thraco-Illyrian correspondences Russu considers are the following:\n\nNot many Thraco-Illyrian correspondences are definite, and a number may be incorrect, even from the list above. However, Sorin Paliga states: \"According to the available data, we may surmise that Thracian and Illyrian were mutually understandable, e.g. like Czech and Slovak, in one extreme, or like Spanish and Portuguese, at the other.\" Other linguists argue that Illyrian and Thracian were different Indo-European branches which later converged through contact. It is also of significance that Illyrian languages still have not been classified whether they were centum or satem language, while it is undisputed that Thracian was a satem language by the Classical Period.\n\nDue to the fragmentary attestation of both Illyrian and Thraco-Dacian, the existence of a Thraco-Illyrian branch remains controversial. In fact, this linguistic hypothesis was seriously called into question in the 1960s. New publications argued that no strong evidence for Thraco-Illyrian exists, and that the two language-areas show more differences than correspondences. The place of Paeonian language remains unclear. Modern linguists are uncertain on the classification of Paeonian, due to the extreme scarcity of materials we have on this language. On one side are Wilhelm Tomaschek and Paul Kretschmer, who claim it belonged to the Illyrian family, and on the other side is Dimiter Dechev, who claims affinities with Thracian.\n\nIn 1977 Georgiev claimed that Daco-Mysian was closely related to the Thracian branch of Indo-European and that Illyrian was different from Thracian \"as much as Iranian from Latin\" for example.\n\nThere are a number of close cognates between Thracian and Albanian, but this may indicate only that Thracian and Albanian are related but not very closely related satem IE languages on their own branches of Indo-European, analogous to the situation between Albanian and the Baltic languages: Albanian and Baltic share many close cognates, while according to Mayer, Albanian is a descendant of Illyrian and escaped any heavy Baltic influence of Daco-Thracian. Still, the hypothesis that Thracian and Albanian form a distinct branch (often in these scenarios, along with Dacian) of Indo-European is given much consideration even today. A few of the cognates between Thracian and Albanian may actually represent borrowings from one language to another; in most cases this is ruled out because a word or lexical item follows the sound-changes expected in the language from its PIE sound-changes.\n\nAmong the cognates between Thracian and Albanian: the Thracian inscription \"mezenai\" on the Duvanli gold ring has been unanimously linked to Messapian \"menzana\" (=horse deity) to Albanian \"mëz\" (=pony), as well as to Romanian \"mânz\" (=colt), and it is agreed that Thracian \"mezenai\" meant 'horseman'; Thracian \"manteia\" is supposed to be cognate to Albanian \"mand\" (=mulberry). This view has not gained wide acceptance among scholars and is rejected by most Albanian linguists, who both mainly consider that Albanian belongs to the Illyrian branch of IE. Polome accepts the claim that Albanian is descended from Illyrian, not Thracian, although he considers the evidence for this as inconclusive. A toponymic analysis of a Bulgarian linguist showed incosistency between toponymy of the Bessi and Albanian toponymy.\n\nSorin Mihai Olteanu, a Romanian linguist and Thracologist, proposed that the Thracian (as well as the Dacian) language was a centum language in its earlier period, and developed satem features over time. One of the arguments for this idea is that there are many close cognates between Thracian and Ancient Greek. There are also substratum words in the Romanian language that are cited as evidence of the genetic relationship of the Thracian language to ancient Greek and the Ancient Macedonian language (the extinct language or Greek dialect of ancient Macedon). The Greek language itself may be grouped with the Phrygian language and Armenian language, both of which have been grouped with Thracian in the past.\n\nAs in the case with Albanian and Balto-Slavic, there is no compelling evidence that Thracian and Greek (or Daco-Thracian and Greco-Macedonian) share a close common ancestor.\n\nFor a long time a Thraco-Phrygian hypothesis grouping Thracian with the extinct Phrygian language was considered, largely based on Greek historians like Strabo. By extension of identifying Phrygians with Proto-Armenians, a Thraco-Phrygian branch of Indo-European was postulated with Thracian, Phrygian and Armenian and constituent languages. The evidence for this seems to have been mostly based on interpretations of history and identifying the eastern Mushki with Armenians and assuming they had branched off from western Mushki (whom has been conclusively identified as Phrygians). \nHowever, in 1988 Fredrik Kortlandt argued, on linguistic grounds such as a common treatment of Proto-Indo-European glottal stops, that Armenian descended from a Thracian dialect. Thus, forming a Thraco-Armenian branch of Indo-European.\nIn 2016 Kortlandt extended his theories, postulating a link between Thraco-Armenian and the hypothetical Graeco-Phrygian language family, despite Thracian and Armenian being Satem languages and Greek and Phrygian Centum languages Kortlandt identifies sound correspondences and grammatical similarities postulating a relationship between his Thraco-Armenian family and the more established Graeco-Phrygian family. \nGraeco-Armenian is by itself a common hypothesized subgrouping of Indo-European languages.\nKortlandt considers Albanian a descendent of Dacian which he regards as belonging to a separate language family as Thraco-Armenian.\n\nOlder textbooks grouped Phrygian and Armenian with Thracian, but the belief is no longer popular and is mostly discarded. Today, Phrygian is not widely seen as linked to Thracian. Georgiev claimed that Thracian is different from Phrygian \"as much as Greek from Albanian\", comparing 150 Phrygian inscriptions. Duridanov found in 1976 Phrygian completely lacking parallels in Thracian and concluded that the Thraco-Phrygian theory is debunked. Duridanov argued that the Thraco-Illyrian theory is a mistake of the past: \"In the past it was regarded that Thracian together with the Phrygian and other vanished languages belonged to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages. This mistake was corrected in the 80’s of the last century, but the ambiguities still persisted: the Thracian was combined in one group with the Phrygian (P. Kretschmer), and later – with the Illyrian (the language, spoken in the modern Dalmatia and Albania).\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5270402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5270402", "title": "Deinstitutionalisation", "text": "Deinstitutionalisation\n\nDeinstitutionalisation (or deinstitutionalization) is the process of replacing long-stay psychiatric hospitals with less isolated community mental health services for those diagnosed with a mental disorder or developmental disability. In the late 20th century, it led to the closure of many psychiatric hospitals, as patients were increasingly cared for at home or in halfway houses, clinics and regular hospitals.\n\nDeinstitutionalisation works in two ways. The first focuses on reducing the population size of mental institutions by releasing patients, shortening stays, and reducing both admissions and readmission rates. The second focuses on reforming psychiatric care to reduce (or avoid encouraging) feelings of dependency, hopelessness and other behaviors that make it hard for patients to adjust to a life outside of care.\n\nThe modern deinstitutionalisation movement was initiated by three factors:\n\nThe movement to reduce institutionalisation was met with wide acceptance in Western countries, though its effects have been the subject of many debates. Some experts, such as E. Fuller Torrey, have argued that deinstitutionalisation was a mistake, while others, such as Thomas Szasz, argue it did not provide enough freedom for patients. Others have argued that it was an improvement on the system that existed before. Psychiatrist Leon Eisenberg has argued that it has generally been beneficial for psychiatric patients, while noting that some were left homeless or without care.\n\nThe 19th century saw a large expansion in the number and size of asylums in Western industrialised countries. Although initially based on principles of moral treatment, they became overstretched, non-therapeutic, isolated in location, and neglectful of patients.\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, increasing admissions had resulted in serious overcrowding, causing many problems for psychiatric institutions. Funding was often cut, especially during periods of economic decline and wartime. Asylums became notorious for poor living conditions, lack of hygiene, overcrowding, ill-treatment, and abuse of patients. Many patients starved to death.\n\nThe first community-based alternatives were suggested and tentatively implemented in the 1920s and 1930s, although asylum numbers continued to increase up to the 1950s. The movement for deinstitutionalisation moved to the forefront in various countries during the 1950s and 1960s with the advent of chlorpromazine and other antipsychotic drugs.\n\nThe prevailing public arguments, time of onset, and pace of reforms varied by country. In the United States, class action lawsuits and the scrutiny of institutions through disability activism and antipsychiatry helped expose poor conditions and treatment. Sociologists and others argued that such institutions maintained or created dependency, passivity, exclusion, and disability, which caused people to remain institutionalised. Rosenhan's experiment in 1973 \"accelerated the movement to reform mental institutions and to deinstitutionalize as many mental patients as possible.\"\n\nA prevailing argument claimed that community services would be cheaper and that new psychiatric medications made it more feasible to release people into the community. Mental health professionals, public officials, families, advocacy groups, public citizens, and unions held differing views on deinstitutionalisation.\n\nA key text in the development of deinstitutionalisation was \"\", a 1961 book by sociologist Erving Goffman. The book is one of the first sociological examinations of the social situation of mental patients, the hospital. Based on his participant observation field work, the book details Goffman's theory of the \"total institution\" (principally in the example he gives, as the title of the book indicates, mental institutions) and the process by which it takes efforts to maintain predictable and regular behavior on the part of both \"guard\" and \"captor,\" suggesting that many of the features of such institutions serve the ritual function of ensuring that both classes of people know their function and social role, in other words of \"institutionalizing\" them.\n\nFranco Basaglia, a leading Italian psychiatrist who inspired and was the architect of the psychiatric reform in Italy, also defined mental hospital as an oppressive, locked and total institution in which prison-like, punitive rules are applied, in order to gradually eliminate its own contents, and patients, doctors and nurses are all subjected (at different levels) to the same process of institutionalism.\n\nThe American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalisation (AAAIMH) was an organisation founded in 1970 by Thomas Szasz, George Alexander, and Erving Goffman for the purpose of abolishing involuntary psychiatric intervention, particularly involuntary commitment, against individuals. The founding of the AAAIMH was announced by Szasz in 1971 in the \"American Journal of Public Health\" and \"American Journal of Psychiatry\". The association provided legal help to psychiatric patients and published a journal, \"The Abolitionist\". The organization was dissolved in 1980.\n\nAmerican psychiatrist Loren Mosher noticed that the psychiatric institution itself gave him master classes in the art of the \"total institution\": labeling, unnecessary dependency, the induction and perpetuation of powerlessness, the degradation ceremony, authoritarianism, and the primacy of institutional needs over those of the persons it was ostensibly there to serve-the patients.\n\nIn \"New York ARC v. Rockefeller\", parents of 5,000 residents at the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island, New York, filed suit over the inhumane living conditions at that institution, where residents were abused and neglected. A 1972 television broadcast from the Willowbrook State School, titled \"Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace,\" outraged the general public. However, it took 3 years from the time the lawsuit documents were filed before the consent judgement was signed. In 1975, the consent judgement was signed, and it committed New York state to improve community placement for the now designated \"Willowbrook Class.\" The Willowbrook State School was closed in 1987, and all but about 150 of the former Willowbrook residents were moved to group homes by 1992.\n\nIn 1973, a federal district court ruled in \"Souder v. Brennan\" that patients in mental health institutions must be considered employees and paid the minimum wage required by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 whenever they performed any activity that conferred an economic benefit on an institution. Following this ruling, institutional peonage was outlawed, as evidenced in Pennsylvania's Institutional Peonage Abolishment Act of 1973.\n\nThere is an increased incarceration for the mental health population due to mental health treatment facilities being closed as a result of the lack of government funding. The solution is to put money back into mental health treatment facilities to decrease the mental health population in jail. Better Mental health services would combat not only mental illness, but homelessness as well. In a survey by the United States Conference of Mayors (2008), 20 percent of cities listed better coordination with mental health service providers as one of the top three items needed to combat homelessness. Incarceration and homelessness are mutual risk factors for each other. Researchers generally estimate that 25-50 percent of the homeless population has a history of incarceration. \nAccording to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 20 to 25 percent of the homeless population in the United States suffers from some sort of severe mental illness (SAMSHA 2018). About a fifth of America’s 1.7 million homeless population suffer from untreated schizophrenia or manic-depressive illness. According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, when you focus in on single adult homeless males, about 16% of them suffer from some form of severe and persistent mental illness. There is general agreement among researchers that the number of mentally ill individuals in jail is substantial, and that many of these individuals are arrested for minor crimes, particularly disorderly conduct or trespassing. There is evidence that a large percentage of jailed individuals may also have been homeless at the time of arrest. Nearly 21 percent were classified as homeless when they were arrested and 40 percent said they had been homeless at some time during the past few years. The researchers concluded that homelessness significantly increases the risk of indictment for violent criminal offenses among mentally disordered offenders (National Coalition for the Homeless 2009). \n\nCommunity services that developed include supportive housing with full or partial supervision and specialised teams (such as assertive community treatment and early intervention teams). Costs have been reported as generally equivalent to inpatient hospitalisation, even lower in some cases (depending on how well or poorly funded the community alternatives are). Although deinstitutionalisation has been positive for the majority of patients, it also has shortcomings.\n\nCriticism of deinstitutionalisation takes two forms. Some, like E. Fuller Torrey, defend the use of psychiatric institutions and conclude that deinstitutionalisation was a move in the wrong direction. Others, such as Walid Fakhoury and Stefan Priebe argue that it was an unsuccessful move in the right direction, suggesting that modern day society faces the problem of \"reinstitutionalisation\". Sometimes these groups have similar criticisms. Both argue that many patients became homeless or in prison.\n\nNew community services are often uncoordinated and unable to meet complex needs. Services in the community sometimes isolate the mentally ill within a new ghetto, where service users meet each other but have little contact with the rest of the public community. Fakhoury and Priebe said that instead of \"community psychiatry\", reforms established a \"psychiatric community\".\n\nFamilies can often play a crucial role in the care of those who would typically be placed in long-term treatment centres. However, many mentally ill people are resistant to such help due to the nature of their conditions. The majority of those who would be under continuous care in long-stay psychiatric hospitals are paranoid and delusional to the point that they refuse help, believing they do not need it, which makes it difficult to treat them.\n\nMoves to community living and services have led to various concerns and fears, from both the individuals themselves and other members of the community. Over a quarter of individuals accessing community mental health services in a US inner-city area are victims of at least one violent crime per year, a proportion eleven times higher than the inner-city average. The elevated victim rate holds for every category of crime, including rape/sexual assault, other violent assaults, and personal and property theft. Victimisation rates are similar to those with developmental disabilities.\n\nDespite perceptions by the public and media that people with mental disorders released into the community are more likely to be dangerous and violent, a large study indicated that those without substance abuse symptoms are no more likely to commit violence than others without substance abuse symptoms in their neighborhoods, which were usually economically deprived and high in substance abuse and crime. The study also reported that a higher proportion of the patients than of the others in the neighborhoods reported symptoms of substance abuse.\n\nFindings on violence committed by those with mental disorders in the community have been inconsistent and related to numerous factors; a higher rate of more serious offences such as homicide have sometimes been found but, despite high-profile homicide cases, the evidence suggests this has not been increased by deinstitutionalisation. The aggression and violence that does occur, in either direction, is usually within family settings rather than between strangers.\n\nIn Hong Kong, a number of residential care services such as halfway houses, long-stay care homes, supported hostels are provided for the discharged patients. In addition, community support services such as rehabilitation day services and mental health care have been launched to facilitate the patients' re-integration into the community.\n\nIn Japan, the number of hospital beds has risen steadily over the last few decades.\n\nUganda has one psychiatric hospital.\n\nNew Zealand established a reconciliation initiative in 2005 to address the ongoing compensation payouts to ex-patients of state-run mental institutions in the 1970s to 1990s. A number of grievances were heard, including: poor reasons for admissions; unsanitary and overcrowded conditions; lack of communication to patients and family members; physical violence and sexual misconduct and abuse; inadequate mechanisms for dealing with complaints; pressures and difficulties for staff, within an authoritarian hierarchy based on containment; fear and humiliation in the misuse of seclusion; over-use and abuse of ECT, psychiatric medications, and other treatments as punishments, including group therapy, with continued adverse effects; lack of support on discharge; interrupted lives and lost potential; and continued stigma, prejudice, and emotional distress and trauma.\n\nThere were some references to instances of helpful aspects or kindnesses despite the system. Participants were offered counselling to help them deal with their experiences, along with advice on their rights, including access to records and legal redress.\n\nIn some countries where deinstitutionalisation has occurred, \"re-institutionalisation\", or relocation to different institutions, has begun, as evidenced by increases in the number of supported housing facilities, forensic psychiatric beds, and the growing prison population.\n\nSome developing European countries still rely on asylums.\n\nItaly was the first country to begin the deinstitutionalisation of mental health care and to develop a community-based psychiatric system. The Italian system served as a model of effective service and paved the way for deinstitutionalisation of mental patients. Since the late 1960s, the Italian physician Giorgio Antonucci questioned the basis itself of psychiatry; from 1973 to 1996 Antonucci worked on the dismantling of the psychiatric hospitals \"Osservanza\" and \"Luigi Lolli \"of Imola and the liberation – and restitution to life – of the people there secluded. In 1978, the Basaglia Law had started Italian psychiatric reform that resulted in the end of the Italian state mental hospital system in 1998.\n\nThe reform was focused on the gradual dismantlement of psychiatric hospitals, which required an effective community mental health service. The object of community care was to reverse the long-accepted practice of isolating the mentally ill in large institutions and to promote their integration in a socially stimulating environment, while avoiding subjecting them to excessive social pressures.\n\nThe work of Giorgio Antonucci, instead of changing the form of commitment from the mental hospital to other forms of coercion, questions the basis of psychiatry, affirming that mental hospitals are the essence of psychiatry and rejecting any possible reform of psychiatry, that must be completely eliminated.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the trend towards deinstitutionalisation began in the 1950s. At the time, 0.4% of the population of England were housed in asylums. The government of Harold Macmillan sponsored the Mental Health Act 1959, which removed the distinction between psychiatric hospitals and other types of hospitals. Enoch Powell, the Minister of Health in the early 1960s, criticized psychiatric institutions in his 1961 \"Water Tower\" speech and called for most of the care to be transferred to general hospitals and the community. The campaigns of Barbara Robb and several scandals involving mistreatment at asylums (notably Ely Hospital) furthered the campaign. The Ely Hospital scandal led to an inquiry led by Brian Abel-Smith and a 1971 white paper that recommended further reform. \n\nThe policy of deinstitutionalisation came to be known as Care in the Community at the time it was taken up by the government of Margaret Thatcher. Large-scale closures of the old asylums began in the 1980s. By 2015, none remained.\n\nThe United States has experienced two main waves of deinstitutionalisation. The first wave began in the 1950s and targeted people with mental illness. The second wave began roughly 15 years later and focused on individuals who had been diagnosed with a developmental disability. Loren Mosher argues that deinstitutionalisation fully began in the 1970s and was due to financial incentives like SSI and Social Security Disability, rather than after the earlier introduction of psychiatric drugs.\n\nThe most important factors that led to deinstitutionalisation were changing public attitudes to mental health and mental hospitals, the introduction of psychiatric drugs and individual states' desires to reduce costs from mental hospitals. The federal government offered financial incentives to the states to achieve this goal. Stroman pinpoints World War II as the point when attitudes began to change. In 1946, \"Life\" magazine published one of the first exposés of the shortcomings of mental illness treatment. Also in 1946, Congress passed the National Mental Health Act of 1946, which created the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). NIMH was pivotal in funding research for the developing mental health field.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy had a special interest in the issue of mental health because his sister, Rosemary, had incurred brain damage after being lobotomised at the age of 23. His administration sponsored the successful passage of the Community Mental Health Act, one of the most important laws that led to deinstitutionalization. The movement continued to gain momentum during the Civil Rights Movement. The 1965 amendments to Social Security shifted about 50% of the mental health care costs from states to the federal government, motivating state governments to promote deinstitutionalization. The 1970s saw the founding of several advocacy groups, including Liberation of Mental Patients, Project Release, Insane Liberation Front, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).\n\nThe 1970s saw some key court rulings that increased the rights of patients, due to lawsuits from these advocacy groups. In 1973, a federal district court ruled in \"Souder v. Brennan\" that patients in mental health institutions must be considered employees and paid the minimum wage required by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 whenever they performed any activity that conferred an economic benefit on an institution. Following this ruling, institutional peonage was outlawed. In 1975, the U.S. Supreme Court restricted the rights of states to incarcerate someone who was not violent. This was followed up with a 1978 ruling further restricting states from confining anyone involuntarily for mental illness. In 1975, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled in favour of the Mental Patient's Liberation Front of Rogers v. Okin, establishing the right of a patient to refuse treatment. Later reforms included the Mental Health Parity Act, which required health insurers to give mental health patients equal coverage.\n\nOther factors include scandals. A 1972 television broadcast exposed the abuse and neglect of 5,000 patients at the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island, New York. The Rosenhan's experiment in 1973 caused several psychiatric hospitals to fail to notice fake patients who showed no symptoms once they were institutionalized. The pitfalls of institutionalization were dramatized in an award-winning 1975 film, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\".\n\nIn 1955 for every 100,000 US citizens there were 340 psychiatric hospital beds. In 2005 that number had diminished to 17 per 100,000.\n\nIn several South American countries, such as in Argentina, the total number of beds in asylum-type institutions has decreased, replaced by psychiatric inpatient units in general hospitals and other local settings.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1430156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1430156", "title": "Gaj's Latin alphabet", "text": "Gaj's Latin alphabet\n\nGaj's Latin alphabet (, or \"gajica\") is the form of the Latin script used for Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, and Montenegrin. It was devised by Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj in 1835, based on Jan Hus's Czech alphabet. A slightly reduced version is used as the script of the Slovene language, and a slightly expanded version is used as a script of the modern standard Montenegrin language. A modified version is used for the romanization of the Macedonian language. Pavao Ritter Vitezović had proposed an idea for the orthography of the Croatian language, stating that every sound should have only one letter. Gaj's alphabet is currently used in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia.\n\nThe alphabet consists of thirty upper and lower case letters:\n\nGaj's original alphabet contained the digraph , which Serbian linguist Đuro Daničić later replaced with the letter .\n\nThe letters do not have names, and consonants are normally pronounced as such when spelling is necessary (or followed by a short schwa, e.g. ). When clarity is needed, they are pronounced similar to the German alphabet: \"a, be, ce, če, će, de, dže, đe, e, ef, ge, ha, i, je, ka, el, elj, em, en, enj, o, pe, er, es, eš, te, u, ve, ze, že\". These rules for pronunciation of individual letters are common as far as the 22 letters that match the ISO basic Latin alphabet are concerned. The use of others is mostly limited to the context of linguistics, while in mathematics, is commonly pronounced \"jot\", as in German. The missing four letters are pronounced as follows: as \"ku\" or \"kju\", as \"dublve\" or \"duplo ve\", as \"iks\", as \"ipsilon\".\n\nNote that the digraphs dž, lj, and nj are considered to be single letters:\n\nThe Croatian Latin alphabet was mostly designed by Ljudevit Gaj, who modelled it after Czech and Polish, and invented , and . In 1830, he published in Buda the book \"Kratka osnova horvatsko-slavenskog pravopisanja\" (\"Brief basics of the Croatian-Slavonic orthography\"), which was the first common Croatian orthography book. It was not the first ever Croatian orthography work, as it was preceded by works of Rajmund Đamanjić (1639), Ignjat Đurđević and Pavao Ritter Vitezović. Croats had previously used the Latin script, but some of the specific sounds were not uniformly represented. Versions of the Hungarian alphabet were most commonly used, but others were too, in an often confused, inconsistent fashion.\n\nGaj followed the example of Pavao Ritter Vitezović and the Czech orthography, making one letter of the Latin script for each sound in the language. His alphabet mapped completely on Serbian Cyrillic which had been standardized by Vuk Karadžić a few years before.\n\nĐuro Daničić suggested in his \"Rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika\" (\"Dictionary of Croatian or Serbian language\") published in 1880 that Gaj's digraphs , , and should be replaced by single letters : , , and respectively. The original Gaj alphabet was eventually revised, but only the digraph has been replaced with Daničić's , while , and have been kept. \n\nIn the 1990s, there was a general confusion about the proper character encoding to use to write text in Latin Croatian on computers.\n\nThe preferred character encoding for Croatian today is either the ISO 8859-2, or the Unicode encoding UTF-8 (with two bytes or 16 bits necessary to use the letters with diacritics). However, , one can still find programs as well as databases that use CP1250, CP852 or even CROSCII.\n\nDigraphs , and in their upper case, title case and lower case forms have dedicated UNICODE code points as shown in the table below, However, these are included chiefly for backwards compatibility (with legacy encodings which kept a one-to-one correspondence with Cyrillic); modern texts use a sequence of characters.\nSince the early 1840s, Gaj's alphabet was increasingly used for the Slovene language. In the beginning, it was most commonly used by Slovene authors who treated Slovene as a variant of Serbo-Croatian (such as Stanko Vraz), but it was later accepted by a large spectrum of Slovene-writing authors. The breakthrough came in 1845, when the Slovene conservative leader Janez Bleiweis started using Gaj's script in his journal \"Kmetijske in rokodelske novice\" (\"Agricultural and Artisan News\"), which was read by a wide public in the countryside. By 1850, Gaj's alphabet (known as \"gajica\" in Slovene) became the only official Slovene alphabet, replacing three other writing systems which circulated in the Slovene Lands since the 1830s: the traditional \"bohoričica\" (after Adam Bohorič who codified it) and the two innovative proposals by the Peter Dajnko (the \"dajnčica\") and Franc Serafin Metelko (the \"metelčica\").\n\nThe Slovene version of Gaj's alphabet differs from the Serbo-Croatian one in several ways:\n\nSlovene orthography is comparatively less phonetic than Serbo-Croatian . For instance, letter can be pronounced in four ways (, , and ), and letter in two ( and , though the difference is not phonemic). Also, it does not record consonant voicing assimilation: compare e.g. Slovene and Serbo-Croatian ('junkyard', 'waste').\n\nRomanization of Macedonian is done according to Gaj's Latin alphabet but is slightly modified. Gaj's \"ć\" and \"đ\" are not used at all, with \"ḱ\" and \"ǵ\" introduced instead. The rest of the letters of the alphabet are used to represent the equivalent Cyrillic letters. Also, Macedonian uses the letter \"dz\", which is not part of the Serbo-Croatian phonemic inventory. However, the backs of record sleeves published in the former Yugoslavia, by non-Macedonian publishers, (such as Mizar's debut album) used \"ć\" and \"đ\", like other places.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3169551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3169551", "title": "Grammaticalization", "text": "Grammaticalization\n\nIn historical linguistics and language change, grammaticalization (also known as grammatization or grammaticization) is a process of language change by which words representing objects and actions (i.e. nouns and verbs) become grammatical markers (affixes, prepositions, etc.). Thus it creates new function words by a process other than deriving them from existing bound, inflectional constructions, instead deriving them from content words. For example, the Old English verb \"willan\" 'to want', 'to wish' has become the Modern English auxiliary verb \"will\", which expresses intention or simply futurity. Some concepts are often grammaticalized, while others, such as evidentiality, not so much.\n\nFor an understanding of this process, a distinction needs to be made between lexical items, or content words, which carry specific lexical meaning, and grammatical items, or function words, with little or no lexical meaning, which serve to express grammatical relationships between the different words in an utterance. Grammaticalization has been defined as \"the change whereby lexical items and constructions come in certain linguistic contexts to serve grammatical functions, and, once grammaticalized, continue to develop new grammatical functions\". Simply said, grammaticalization is the process in which a lexical word or a word cluster loses some or all of its lexical meaning and starts to fulfil a more grammatical function. Where grammaticalization takes place, nouns and verbs which carry certain lexical meaning develop over time into grammatical items such as auxiliaries, case markers, inflections, and sentence connectives.\n\nA well-known example of grammaticalization is that of the process in which the lexical cluster \"let us\", for example in \"let us eat\", is reduced to \"let's\" as in \"let's you and me fight\". Here, the phrase has lost its lexical meaning of \"allow us\" and has become an auxiliary introducing a suggestion, the pronoun 'us' reduced first to a suffix and then to an unanalyzed phoneme.\n\nAnother example of grammaticalization occurs in American English with \"sure\", where it is used in routine phrases and as a response. It also features in many collocations, such as \"sure do\", \"sure can\" and \"sure is\".\n\nThe concept was developed in the works of Bopp (1816), Schlegel (1818), Humboldt (1825) and Gabelentz (1891). Humboldt, for instance, came up with the idea of evolutionary language. He suggested that in all languages grammatical structures evolved out of a language stage in which there were only words for concrete objects and ideas. In order to successfully communicate these ideas, grammatical structures slowly came into existence. Grammar slowly developed through four different stages, each in which the grammatical structure would be more developed. Though neo-grammarians like Brugmann rejected the separation of language into distinct \"stages\" in favour of uniformitarian assumptions, they were positively inclined towards some of these earlier linguists' hypotheses.\n\nThe term \"grammaticalization\" in the modern sense was coined by the French linguist Antoine Meillet in his \"L'évolution des formes grammaticales\" (1912). Meillet's definition was \"the attribution of grammatical character to an erstwhile autonomous word\". Meillet showed that what was at issue was not the origins of grammatical forms but their transformations. He was thus able to present a notion of the creation of grammatical forms as a legitimate study for linguistics. Later studies in the field have further developed and altered Meillet's ideas and have introduced many other examples of grammaticalization.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, the study of grammatical change over time became somewhat unfashionable, in contrast to structuralist ideas of language change in which grammaticalization did not play a role. The field of linguistics at the time was strongly concerned with synchronic studies of language change, which marginalized historical approaches such as grammaticalization. It did however, mostly in Indo-European studies, remain an instrument for explaining language change.\n\nIt was not until the 1970s, with the growth of interest in discourse analysis and linguistic universals, that the interest for grammaticalization in linguistic studies began to grow again. A greatly influential work in the domain was Christian Lehmann's \"Thoughts on Grammaticalization\" (1982). This was the first work to emphasize the continuity of research from the earliest period to the present, and it provided a survey of the major work in the field. Lehmann also invented a set of 'parameters', a method along which grammaticality could be measured both synchronically and diachronically.\n\nAnother important work was Heine and Reh's \"Grammaticalization and Reanalysis in African Languages\" (1984). This work focussed on African languages synchronically from the point of view of grammaticalization. They saw grammaticalization as an important tool for describing the workings of languages and their universal aspects and it provided an exhaustive list of the pathways of grammaticalization.\n\nThe great number of studies on grammaticalization in the last decade show grammaticalization remains a popular item and is regarded as an important field within linguistic studies in general. Among recent publications there is a wide range of descriptive studies trying to come up with umbrella definitions and exhaustive lists, while others tend to focus more on its nature and significance, questioning the opportunities and boundaries of grammaticalization. An important and popular topic which is still debated is the question of unidirectionality.\n\nIt is difficult to capture the term \"grammaticalization\" in one clear definition (see the 'various views on grammaticalization' section below). However, there are some processes that are often linked to grammaticalization. These are semantic bleaching, phonetic erosion, morphological reduction and obligatorification.\n\nSemantic bleaching, or desemanticization, has been seen from early on as a characteristic of grammaticalization. It can be described as the loss of semantic content. More specifically, with reference to grammaticalization, bleaching refers to the loss of all (or most) lexical content of an entity while only its grammatical content is retained, for example James Matisoff described bleaching as \"the partial effacement of a morpheme's semantic features, the stripping away of some of its precise content so it can be used in an abstracter, grammatical-hardware-like way\". John Haiman wrote that \"semantic reduction, or bleaching, occurs as a morpheme loses its intention: From describing a narrow set of ideas, it comes to describe an ever broader range of them, and eventually may lose its meaning altogether\". He saw this as one of the two kinds of change that are always associated with grammaticalization (the other being phonetic reduction).\n\nOnce a linguistic expression has changed from a lexical to a grammatical meaning (bleaching), it is likely to lose morphological and syntactic elements that were characteristic of its initial category, but which are not relevant to the grammatical function. This is called \"decategorialization,\" or \"morphological reduction\".\n\nFor example, the demonstrative 'that' as in \"that book\" came to be used as a relative clause marker, and lost the grammatical category of number ('that' singular vs. 'those' plural), as in \"the book that I know\" versus \"the things that I know\".\n\nPhonetic erosion (also called phonological attrition or phonological reduction), is another process that is often linked to grammaticalization. It implies that a linguistic expression loses phonetic substance when it has undergone grammaticalization. Heine writes that \"once a lexeme is conventionalized as a grammatical marker, it tends to undergo erosion; that is, the phonological substance is likely to be reduced in some way and to become more dependent on surrounding phonetic material\".\n\nBernd Heine and Tania Kuteva have described different kinds of phonetic erosion for applicable cases:\n\n\n'Going to' → 'gonna' (or even 'I am going to' → 'I'm gonna' → 'I'mma') and 'because' → 'coz' are examples of erosion in English. Some linguists trace erosion to the speaker's tendency to follow the principle of least effort, while others think that erosion is a sign of changes taking place.\n\nHowever, phonetic erosion, a common process of language change that can take place with no connection to grammaticalization, is not a necessary property of grammaticalization. For example, the Latin construction of the type \"clarā mente\", meaning 'with a clear mind' is the source of modern Romance productive adverb formation, as in Italian \"chiaramente\", Spanish \"claramente\" 'clearly'. In both languages, -\"mente\" in this usage is interpretable by today's native speakers only as a morpheme signaling 'adverb' and it has undergone no phonological erosion from the Latin source, \"mente\". This example also illustrates that semantic bleaching of a form in its grammaticalized morphemic role does not necessarily imply bleaching of its lexical source, and that the two can separate neatly in spite of maintaining identical phonological form: the noun \"mente\" is alive and well today in both Italian and Spanish with its meaning 'mind', yet native speakers do not recognize the noun 'mind' in the suffix \"-mente\".\n\nThe phonetic erosion may bring a brand-new look to the phonological system of a language, by changing the inventory of phones and phonemes, making new arrangements in the phonotactic patterns of a syllable, etc. Special treatise on the phonological consequences of grammaticalization and lexicalization in the Chinese languages can be found in Wei-Heng Chen(2011), which provides evidence how an morph-phonological change can later change into a purely phonological change and evidence that there is typological difference in the phonetic and phonological consequences of grammaticalization between monosyllabic languages (featuring an obligatory match between syllable and morpheme, with exceptions of either loanwords or derivations like reduplicatives or diminutives, other morphological alternations) vs non-monosyllabic languages (including disyllabic or bisyllabic Austronesian languages, Afro-Asiatic languages featuring a tri-consonantal word root, Indo-European languages without a 100% obligatory match between such a sound unit as syllable and such a meaning unit as morpheme or word, despite an assume majority of monosyllabic reconstructed word stems/roots in the Proto-Indo-European hypothesis), a difference mostly initiated by the German linguist W. Humboldt, putting Sino-Tibetan languages in a sharp contrast to the other languages in the world in typology.\n\nObligatorification occurs when the use of linguistic structures becomes increasingly more obligatory in the process of grammaticalization. Lehmann describes it as a reduction in transparadigmatic variability, by which he means that \"the freedom of the language user with regard to the paradigm as a whole\" is reduced. Examples of obligatoriness can be found in the category of number, which can be obligatory in some languages or in specific contexts, in the development of articles, and in the development of personal pronouns of some languages. Some linguists, like Heine and Kuteva, stress the fact that even though obligatorification can be seen as an important process, it is not necessary for grammaticalization to take place, and it also occurs in other types of language change.\n\nAlthough these 'parameters of grammaticalization' are often linked to the theory, linguists such as Bybee et al. (1994) have acknowledged that independently, they are not essential to grammaticalization. In addition, most are not limited to grammaticalization but can be applied in the wider context of language change. Critics of the theory of grammaticalization have used these difficulties to claim that grammaticalization has no independent status of its own, that all processes involved can be described separately from the theory of grammaticalization. Janda, for example, wrote that \"given that even writers on grammaticalization themselves freely acknowledge the involvement of several distinct processes in the larger set of phenomena, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the notion of grammaticalization, too, tends to represent an epiphenomenal telescoping. That is, it may involve certain typical \"path(way)s\", but the latter seem to be built out of separate stepping-stones which can often be seen in isolation and whose individual outlines are always distinctly recognizable\".\n\nIn the process of grammaticalization, an uninflected lexical word (or content word) is transformed into a grammar word (or function word). The process by which the word leaves its word class and enters another is not sudden, but occurs by a gradual series of individual shifts. The overlapping stages of grammaticalization form a chain, generally called a cline. These shifts generally follow similar patterns in different languages. Linguists do not agree on the precise definition of a cline or on its exact characteristics in given instances. It is believed that the stages on the cline do not always have a fixed position, but vary. However, Hopper and Traugott's famous pattern for the cline of grammaticalization illustrates the various stages of the form:\n\nThis particular cline is called \"the cline of grammaticality\" or the \"cycle of categorial downgrading\", and it is a common one. In this cline every item to the right represents a more grammatical and less lexical form than the one to its left.\n\nIt is very common for full verbs to become auxiliaries and eventually inflexional endings. An example of this phenomenon can be seen in the change from the Old English (OE) verb willan ('to want/to wish') to an auxiliary verb signifying intention in Middle English (ME). In Present Day English (PDE) this form is even shortened to 'll, and no longer necessarily implies intention, but often is simply a mark of future tense (see shall and will). The PDE verb 'will' can thus be said to have less lexical meaning than its preceding form in OE.\n\n\nThe final stage of grammaticalization has happened in many languages. For example, in Serbo-Croatian, the Old Church Slavonic verb \"xъtěti\" (to want/to wish, the same as Old English \"willan\") has gone from a content word (\"hoću hoditi, hoćeš hoditi, hoće hoditi\" 'I/you/s/he wants to walk') to an auxiliary verb in phonetically reduced form (\"ću hoditi, ćeš hoditi, će hoditi\" 'I/you/s/he will walk') to a clitic (\"hoditi ću, hoditi ćeš, hoditi će\"), and finally to a fused inflection (\"hodiću, hodićeš, hodiće\" 'I/you/s/he will walk'). In Latin the original future tense forms (e.g. cantabo) were dropped when they became phonetically too close to the imperfect forms (cantabam). Instead, a phrase like \"cantare habeo\", literally \"I have got to sing\" acquired the sense of futurity (cf. I have to sing). Finally it became true future tense in almost all Romance languages and the auxiliary became a full-fledged inflection (cf. Spanish \"cantaré, cantarás, cantará\", French je \"chanterai, tu chanteras, il/elle chantera\", Italian \"canterò, canterai, canterà\", I will sing, you will sing, s/he will sing). In some verbs the process went further and produced irregular forms [cf. Spanish \"haré\" (instead of *\"haceré\", I'll do) and \"tendré\" (not *\"teneré\", I'll have, the loss of \"e\" followed by epenthesis of \"d\" is especially common)] and even regular forms (the change the \"a\" in the stem \"\" to \"e\" in \"canterò\" has affected the whole class of conjugation type I Italian verbs).\n\nCompare the German verb \"wollen\" which has partially undergone a similar path of grammaticalization, and note the simultaneous existence of the non-grammaticalized Modern English verb \"to will\" (e.g. \"He willed himself to continue along the steep path.\") or \"hoteti\" in Serbo-Croatian (\"Hoċu da hodim\" = I want that I walk).\n\nAn illustrative example of this cline is in the orthography of Japanese compound verbs. Many Japanese words are formed by connecting two verbs, as in , and in Japanese orthography lexical items are generally written with kanji (here 行く and 聞く), while grammatical items are written with hiragana (as in the connecting て). Compound verbs are thus generally written with a kanji for each constituent verb, but some suffixes have become grammaticalized, and are written in hiragana, such as , from , as in .\n\nIn \"Grammaticalization\" (2003) Hopper and Traugott state that the cline of grammaticalization has both diachronic and synchronic implications. Diachronically (i.e. looking at changes over time), clines represent a natural path along which forms or words change over time. However, synchronically (i.e. looking at a single point in time), clines can be seen as an arrangement of forms along imaginary lines, with at one end a 'fuller' or lexical form and at the other a more 'reduced' or grammatical form. What Hopper and Traugott mean is that from a diachronic or historical point of view, changes of word forms is seen as a natural process, whereas synchronically, this process can be seen as inevitable instead of historical.\n\nThe studying and documentation of recurrent clines enable linguists to form general laws of grammaticalization and language change in general. It plays an important role in the reconstruction of older states of a language. Moreover, the documenting of changes can help to reveal the lines along which a language is likely to develop in the future.\n\nThe unidirectionality hypothesis is the idea that grammaticalization, the development of lexical elements into grammatical ones, or less grammatical into more grammatical, is the preferred direction of linguistic change, that a grammatical item is much less likely to move backwards rather than forwards on Hopper & Traugott's cline of grammaticalization.\nIn the words of Bernd Heine, \"grammaticalization is a unidirectional process, that is, it leads from less grammatical to more grammatical forms and constructions\". This is one of the strongest claims about grammaticalization, and is often cited as one of its basic principles. In addition, unidirectionality refers to a general developmental orientation which all (or the large majority) of the cases of grammaticalization have in common, and which can be paraphrased in abstract, general terms, independent of any specific case.\n\nThe idea of unidirectionality is an important one when trying to predict language change through grammaticalization (and for making the claim that grammaticalization can be predicted). Lessau notes that \"unidirectionality in itself is a predictive assertion in that it selects the general type of possible development (it predicts the direction of any given incipient case),\" and unidirectionality also rules out an entire range of development types that do not follow this principle, hereby limiting the amount of possible paths of development.\n\nAlthough unidirectionality is a key element of grammaticalization, it is not absolute. Indeed, the possibility of counterexamples, coupled with their rarity, is given as evidence for the general operating principle of unidirectionality. According to Lyle Campbell, however, advocates often minimize the counterexamples or redefine them as not being part of the grammaticalization cline. He gives the example of Hopper and Traugott (1993) who treat some putative counterexamples as cases of lexicalization in which a grammatical form is incorporated into a lexical item but does not itself become a lexical item. An example is the phrase \"to up the ante,\" which incorporates the preposition \"up\" (a function word) in a verb (a content word) but without \"up\" becoming a verb outside of this lexical item. Since it is the entire phrase \"to up the ante\" that is the verb, Hopper and Traugott argue that the word \"up\" itself cannot be said to have degrammaticalized, a view that is challenged to some extent by parallel usages such as \"to up the bid\", \"to up the payment\", \"to up the deductions\", \"to up the medication\", by the fact that in all cases \"the\" can be replaced by a possessive (my, your, her, Bill's, etc.), and by further extensions still: \"he upped his game\" 'he improved his performance'.\n\nExamples that are not confined to a specific lexical item are less common. One is the English genitive -'s, which, in Old English, was a suffix but, in Modern English, is a clitic. As Jespersen (1894) put it,\nTraugott cites a counterexample from function to content word proposed by Kate Burridge (1998): the development in Pennsylvania German of the auxiliary \"wotte\" of the preterite subjunctive modal \"welle\" 'would' (from 'wanted') into a full verb 'to wish, to desire'.\n\nIn comparison to various instances of grammaticalization, there are relatively few counterexamples to the unidirectionality hypothesis, and they often seem to require special circumstances to occur. One is found in the development of Irish Gaelic with the origin of the first-person-plural pronoun \"muid\" (a function word) from the inflectional suffix \"-mid\" (as in \"táimid\" 'we are') because of a reanalysis based on the verb-pronoun order of the other persons of the verb. Another well-known example is the degrammaticalization of the North Saami abessive ('without') case suffix -\"haga\" to the postposition \"haga\" 'without' and further to a preposition and a free-standing adverb. Moreover, the morphologically analogous derivational suffix -\"naga\" 'stained with' (e.g., \"gáffenaga\" 'stained with coffee', \"oljonaga\" 'stained with oil') – itself based on the essive case marker *-\"na\" – has degrammaticalized into an independent noun \"naga\" 'stain'.\n\nLinguists have come up with different interpretation of the term 'grammaticalization', and there are many alternatives to the definition given in the introduction. The following will be a non-exhaustive list of authors who have written about the subject with their individual approaches to the nature of the term 'grammaticalization'.\n\n\nSince then, the study of grammaticalization has become broader, and linguists have extended the term into various directions.\n\n\n\nFrom Language Sciences Volume 23, March (2001):\n"}

This product will certainly be at most 1/4. The conjecture makes no statement about whether this sequence of values will converge; it typically does not, in fact. The conjecture states something about the limit inferior, and says that there is a subsequence for which the distances decay faster than the reciprocal, i.e.\n\nin the little-o notation.\n\nIt is known that this would follow from a result in the geometry of numbers, about the minimum on a non-zero lattice point of a product of three linear forms in three real variables: the implication was shown in 1955 by J. W. S. Cassels and Swinnerton-Dyer. This can be formulated another way, in group-theoretic terms. There is now another conjecture, expected to hold for \"n\" ≥ 3: it is stated in terms of \"G\" = \"SL\"(\"R\"), Γ = \"SL\"(\"Z\"), and the subgroup \"D\" of diagonal matrices in \"G\".\n\nConjecture: for any \"g\" in \"G\"/Γ such that \"Dg\" is relatively compact (in \"G\"/Γ), then \"Dg\" is closed.\n\nThis in turn is a special case of a general conjecture of Margulis on Lie groups.\n\nBorel showed in 1909 that the exceptional set of real pairs (α,β) violating the statement of the conjecture is of Lebesgue measure zero. Manfred Einsiedler, Anatole Katok and Elon Lindenstrauss have shown that it must have Hausdorff dimension zero; and in fact is a union of countably many compact sets of box-counting dimension zero. The result was proved by using measure classification theorem for diagonalizable actions of higher-rank groups, and an \"isolation theorem\" proved by Lindenstrauss and Barak Weiss.\n\nThese results imply that non-trivial pairs satisfying the conjecture exist: indeed, given a real number α such that formula_3, it is possible to construct an explicit β such that (α,β) satisfies the conjecture.\n\n"}

It is also spelled Mapuzugun and Mapudungu. It was formerly known as Araucanian, the name given to the Mapuche by the Spaniards; the Mapuche avoid it as a remnant of Spanish colonialism, and it is considered offensive.\n\nMapudungun is not an official language of Chile or Argentina and has received virtually no government support throughout its history. It is not used as a language of instruction in either country’s educational system despite the Chilean government's commitment to provide full access to education in Mapuche areas in southern Chile. There is an ongoing political debate over which alphabet to use as the standard alphabet of written Mapudungun. There are approximately 144,000 native speakers in Chile and another 8,400 in west central Argentina. \n\nOnly 2.4% of urban speakers and 16% of rural speakers use Mapudungun when speaking with children, and only 3.8% of speakers aged 10–19 years in the south of Chile (the language’s stronghold) are \"highly competent\" in the language.\n\nDepending on the alphabet, the sound is spelled or , and as or . The language is called either the \"speech (') of the land (')\" or the \"speech of the people (\"\")\". An may connect the two words. There are thus several ways to write the name of the language:\n\nWhen the Spanish arrived in Chile, they found four groups of Mapuche speakers in the region of Araucanía, from which the Spanish called them \"araucanos\": the Picunche people (from ' 'north' and ' 'people'), the Huilliche people (from ' 'south'), the Pehuenche people (from ' 'monkey puzzle tree' \"Araucaria araucana\"), and the Moluche people (from \"\" 'west'). The Picunche were conquered quite rapidly by the Spanish, whereas the Huilliche were not assimilated until the 18th century. \n\nMapudungun was the only language spoken in central Chile. The sociolinguistic situation of the Mapuche has changed rapidly. Now, nearly all of Mapuche people are bilingual or monolingual in Spanish. The degree of bilingualism depends on the community, participation in Chilean society, and the individual's choice towards the traditional or modern/urban way of life.\n\nThere is some lexical influence from the Quechuan languages (\"pataka\" 'hundred', \"warangka\" 'thousand') and more recently from Spanish.\n\nLinguist Robert A. Croese divides Mapudungun into eight dialectal sub-groups (I-VIII). Sub-group I is centered in Arauco Province, Sub-group II is the dialect of Angol, Los Ángeles and the middle and lower Bío Bío River. Sub-group III is centered around Purén. In the areas around Lonquimay, Melipeuco and Allipén River dialect sub-group IV is spoken. Sub-group V is spoken at the coast of Araucanía Region including Queule, Budi Lake and Toltén. \n\nTemuco is the epicenter of the Mapuche territory today. Around Temuco, Freire and Gorbea the sub-group VI is spoken. Group VII is spoken in Valdivia Province plus Pucón and Curarrehue. The last \"dialect\" sub-group is VIII which is the Huilliche language spoken from Lago Ranco and Río Bueno to the south and is not mutually intelligible with the other dialects.\n\nThese can be grouped in four dialect groups: north, central, south-central and south. These are further divided into eight sub-groups: I and II (northern), III–IV (central), V-VII (south-central) and VIII (southern). The sub-groups III-VII are more closely related to each other than they are to I-II and VIII. Croese finds these relationships as consistent, but not proof, with the theory of origin of the Mapuche proposed by Ricardo E. Latcham.\n\nThe Mapudungun spoken in the Argentinean provinces of Neuquen and Rio Negro is similar to that of the central dialect group in Chile, while the Ranquel (Ranku ̈lche) variety spoken in the Argentinean province of La Pampa is closer to the northern dialect group.\n\nMapudungun has partially predictable, non-contrastive stress. The stressed syllable is generally the last one if it is closed (' 'game', ' 'thunder'), and the one before last if the last one is open (' 'house', ' 'head'). There is no phonemic tone.\n\n\n is spelled , , or , depending on the alphabet.\n\n\nThe Mapuche had no writing system before the Spanish arrived, but the language is now written with the Latin script. Although the orthography used in this article is based on the \"Alfabeto Mapuche Unificado\", the system used by Chilean linguists and other people in many publications in the language, the competing Ragileo, Nhewenh and Azumchefi systems all have their supporters, and there is still no consensus among authorities, linguists and Mapuche communities. The same word can look very different in each system, with the word for \"conversation or story\" being written either \"gvxam\" or \"ngütram\", for example.\n\nIn late 2006, Mapuche leaders threatened to sue Microsoft when the latter completed a translation of their Windows operating system into Mapudungun. They claimed that Microsoft needed permission to do so and had not sought it. The event can be seen in the light of the greater political struggle concerning the alphabet that should become the standard alphabet of the Mapuche people.\n\n\"Mesa-mew müle-y ti mamüllü ñi müle-n mi tukupu-a-l.\" \n\ntable-loc be-ind/3sS the wood poss be-noml 2s.poss use-nrld-noml\n\n‘On the table is the wood that you should use.’ \n\n\nThe indicative present paradigm for an intransitive verb like \" 'enter' is as follows:\n\nWhat some authors have described as an inverse system (similar to the ones described for Algonquian languages) can be seen from the forms of a transitive verb like \" 'see'. The 'intransitive' forms are the following:\nThe 'transitive' forms are the following (only singular forms are provided here):\nWhen a third person interacts with a first or second person, the forms are direct (without \"-e\") or inverse (with \"-e\"); the speaker has no choice. When two third persons interact, two different forms are available: the direct form (') is appropriate when the agent is topical (the central figure in that particular passage). The inverse form (') is appropriate when the patient is topical. Thus, ' means 'the man saw the woman' while ' means something like 'the man was seen by the woman'. However, that it is not a passive construction; the passive would be \"\" 'the man was seen; someone saw the man'. Therefore, a better translation may be 'it was the woman who saw the man' or 'the woman was the one who saw the man'.\n\nThe Chilean Ministry of Education created the Office of Intercultural Bilingual Education in 1996 in an attempt to include indigenous language in education. By 2004, there were still no programs in public schools in Santiago, despite the fact that 50% of the country’s Mapuche population resides in and around the area of Santiago. 30.4% of Mapuche students never graduate eighth grade and they have high rates of poverty. No university holds courses on Mapudungu. Most language revitalization efforts have been in rural communities and these efforts have been received in different ways by the Mapuche population: Ortiz says some feel that teaching Mapudungu in schools will set their children behind other Chileans, which reveals that their culture has been devalued by the Chilean government for so long that, unfortunately, some Mapuche people have come to see their language as worthless, too, which is a direct and lasting impact of colonization. \n\nThe formalization and normalization of Mapudungun was effected by the first Mapudungun grammar published by the Jesuit priest Luis de Valdivia in 1606 (\"Arte y Gramatica General de la Lengva que Corre en Todo el Reyno de Chile\"). More important is the \"Arte de la Lengua General del Reyno de Chile\" by the Jesuit Andrés Febrés (1765, Lima) composed of a grammar and dictionary. In 1776 three volumes in Latin were published in Westfalia (\"Chilidúgú sive Res Chilenses\") by the German Jesuit Bernardo Havestadt. The work by Febrés was used as a basic preparation from 1810 for missionary priests going into the regions occupied by the Mapuche people. A corrected version was completed in 1846 and a summary, without a dictionary in 1864. A work based on Febrés' book is the \"Breve Metodo della Lingua Araucana y Dizionario Italo-Araucano e Viceversa\" by the Italian Octaviano de Niza in 1888. It was destroyed in a fire at the Convento de San Francisco in Valdivia in 1928.\n\nThe most comprehensive works to date are the ones by Augusta (1903, 1916). Salas (1992, 2006) is an introduction for non-specialists, featuring an ethnographic introduction and a valuable text collection as well. Zúñiga (2006) includes a complete grammatical description, a bilingual dictionary, some texts and an audio CD with text recordings (educational material, a traditional folktale and six contemporary poems). Smeets (1989) and Zúñiga (2000) are for specialists only. Fernández-Garay (2005) introduces both the language and the culture. Catrileo (1995) and the dictionaries by Hernández & Ramos are trilingual (Spanish, English and Mapudungun).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1919, during the Russian Civil War, he served for several months in the Red Army before being discharged for health reasons.\nHe was associated with the Serapion Brothers and attained particular popularity in the 1920s as a satirist, but, after his denunciation in the Zhdanov decree of 1946, Zoshchenko lived in dire poverty. He was awarded his pension only a few months before he died. \nZoshchenko developed a simplified deadpan style of writing which simultaneously made him accessible to \"the people\" and mocked official demands for accessibility: \"I write very compactly. My sentences are short. Accessible to the poor. Maybe that's the reason why I have so many readers.\" Volkov compares this style to the nakedness of the Russian holy fool or \"yurodivy\". \nZoshchenko wrote a series of short stories for children about Vladimir Lenin.\n\n\n\n"}

A Welsh form of the Oath is prescribed by the National Assembly for Wales (Oath of Allegiance in Welsh) Order 1999.\n\nThe Oath of Allegiance is in the following form:\nThe Official Oath is in the following form:\nThe standard form of the judicial oath is set out in the Promissory Oaths Act 1868:\n\nThose choosing affirm simply replace \"do swear by Almighty God\" with \"solemnly sincerely and truly declare and affirm\"\n\nIn Northern Ireland all references to the Sovereign were removed by the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002.\n\nSection 19(2) provides that the oath is —\nSection 19(3) provides that the affirmation and declaration is —\nAll persons enlisting in the British Armed Forces are required to attest to the following oath or equivalent affirmation:\n\nPrivy Counsellors take office on being \"sworn of the Privy Council\". It was formerly regarded as criminal to disclose the form of Privy Council oath, which includes an undertaking of secrecy as to the proceedings in Council (where the Oath is taken). On 28 July 1964 it was published by the President of the Council in answer to a written parliamentary question.\n\nA person appointed to the office of constable of a police force in Scotland is required to make the following declaration:\n\n\"I hereby do solemnly and sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of constable.\"\n\nWhile the oath-taking dates back to the First Congress in 1789, the current oath is a product of the 1860s, drafted by Civil War-era members of Congress intent on ensnaring traitors.\n\nIn 1789, the 1st United States Congress created an oath to fulfill the requirement of Article VI of the United States Constitution:\n\nThe outbreak of the Civil War quickly transformed the routine act of oath-taking into one of enormous significance. In April 1861, a time of uncertain and shifting loyalties, President Abraham Lincoln ordered all federal civilian employees within the executive branch to take an expanded oath. When Congress convened for a brief emergency session in July, members echoed the president's action by enacting legislation requiring employees to take the expanded oath in support of the Union. This oath is the earliest direct predecessor of the modern version of the oath.\n\nWhen Congress returned for its regular session in December 1861, members who believed that the Union had as much to fear from northern traitors as southern soldiers again revised the oath, adding a new first section known as the \"Ironclad Test Oath.\" The war-inspired Test Oath, signed into law on July 2, 1862, required \"every person elected or appointed to any office ... under the Government of the United States ... excepting the President of the United States\" to swear or affirm that they had never previously engaged in criminal or disloyal conduct. Those government employees who failed to take the 1862 Test Oath would not receive a salary; those who swore falsely would be prosecuted for perjury and forever denied federal employment.\n\nThe 1862 oath's second section incorporated a different rendering of the hastily drafted 1861 oath. Although Congress did not extend coverage of the Ironclad Test Oath to its own members, many took it voluntarily. Angered by those who refused this symbolic act during a wartime crisis, and determined to prevent the eventual return of prewar southern leaders to positions of power in the national government, congressional hard-liners eventually succeeded by 1864 in making the Test Oath mandatory for all members.\n\nThe Senate then revised its rules to require that members not only take the Test Oath orally, but also that they \"subscribe\" to it by signing a printed copy. This condition reflected a wartime practice in which military and civilian authorities required anyone wishing to do business with the federal government to sign a copy of the Test Oath. The current practice of newly sworn senators signing individual pages in an oath book dates from this period.\n\nAs tensions cooled during the decade following the Civil War, Congress enacted private legislation permitting particular former Confederates to take only the second section of the 1862 oath. An 1868 public law prescribed this alternative oath for \"any person who has participated in the late rebellion, and from whom all legal disabilities arising therefrom have been removed by act of Congress.\" Northerners immediately pointed to the new law's unfair double standard that required loyal Unionists to take the Test Oath's harsh first section while permitting ex-Confederates to ignore it. In 1884, a new generation of lawmakers quietly repealed the first section of the Test Oath, leaving intact the current affirmation of constitutional allegiance.\n\nIn the United States, the oath of office for the President is specified in the Constitution ():\n\nThe oath may be sworn or affirmed (in which case it is called an \"affirmation\" instead of \"oath\"). Although not present in the text of the Constitution, it is customary for modern presidents to say \"So help me God\" after the end of the oath. For officers other than the President, the expression \"So help me God\" is explicitly prescribed, but the Judiciary Act of 1789 also explains when it can be omitted (specifically for oaths taken by court clerks): \"Which words, so help me God, shall be omitted in all cases where an affirmation is admitted instead of an oath.\"\n\nThe Constitution (Article VI, clause 3) also specifies:\nAt the start of each new U.S. Congress, in January of every odd-numbered year, newly elected or re-elected Members of Congress – the entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate – must recite an oath:\n\nThis oath is also taken by the Vice President, members of the Cabinet, federal judges and all other civil and military officers and federal employees other than the President.\n\nIn the United States, federal judges are required to take two oaths. The first oath is this:\n\nThe second is the same oath that members of Congress take:\n\nFederal statute specifically says that the latter oath \"does not affect other oaths required by law.\"\n\nSee \"United States Uniformed Services Oath of Office\".\n\nThe oaths of state and local officials are largely patterned on the federal oath of constitutional allegiance. Typical would be the oath taken by all New York government officials:\n\nAll elected county officials and the appointed officers such as clerk and master, and deputies to these officers, are required to take an oath of office which actually consists of two oaths: the\nconstitutional oath, and an oath for the particular office or fidelity oath (Tenn. Const. Art. X, Sec. 1). The following is combination fidelity and constitutional oath:\nThe simple constitutional oath and fidelity oath are taken by persons who do not have a more specific oath prescribed by law (T.C.A. § 8-18-111). This basic oath is used upon entering the\nfollowing offices:\nCounty Executive/Mayor\nCounty Clerk (or deputy county clerk by substituting the word \"appointed\" for \"elected\")\nCounty Register (or deputy register by substituting the word \"appointed\" for \"elected\")\nChief administrative officer of the county highway department\n\nCounty commissioners may use the same basic oath as noted above, but phrased as follows:\nClerks of court, deputy clerks of court, sheriffs, deputy sheriffs, assessors of property and deputy assessors, constables with law enforcement powers, constables without law enforcement powers, general sessions court judges, and school board members in Tennessee all have specific variations of their oaths of office.\n\nThe President of Venezuela, upon assumption of the office on his inauguration, is asked by the President of the National Assembly (until 1999, the Senate President, on behalf of the entire National Federal Congress), holding a copy of the Constitution of Venezuela, the following:\n\nWith the right hand on the shoulder level he answers with a \"Yes I swear\" and the President then responds: \"If you do so, before God and the Fatherland your duties will be performed, and it will be demanded of you if you not. Therefore, in the name of the Republic and by the authority of the law, I investiture you as Constitutional President of the Republic as of this moment for this term period.\" Then the Presidential Sash (with the colors and coat of arms from the Flag of Venezuela and the collar of the Order of the Liberatiors is turned over to him from the outgoing President, but if the case is that of succession due to death of office of his predecessor both items are cased and are given to him by the National Assembly President instead. If reelected the method is the same as after the sudden death of the President while in office.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church requires all of its clergy before ordination and most of those promoted to positions of authority to make a \"Profession of Faith,\" as below. It is very similar to the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed (referred to as the Symbol of Faith).\n\nFurther, all of those promoted to positions of authority (vicars general, judicial vicars, episcopal vicars, pastors of parishes and superiors within religious orders) or with teaching responsibilities (rectors of seminaries, professors at seminaries, heads or Catholic universities or professors on the faculties of Catholic colleges and universities who teach subjects involving religion), and all those ordained deacons (and therefore all those who will also later be ordained priests) to take the following \"Oath of Fidelity\"\n\n\n\n"}

However he started his legal practice in Bijapur<nowiki>. He was an important public figure serving in several different capacities. He was an educationist and a vocal supporter of social reformation. As part of the educational reforms of the Lingayaths, he established a high school in 1910. He was also very active in ameliorating the conditions of the farmers and for this purpose he established a co-operative society in 1912 to help small-scale farmers, weavers, pot-makers, etc. His tenure as a member of the Mumbai Legislative Council in 1920 gave a much needed impetus to the politics of Bijapur and he enjoyed an important position among his colleagues and friends. \"His political activities during this period also helped him building contacts with several national leaders and their followers\" (The \"Discovery\" of Vachanas, 2012). </nowiki>\n\nBut his interest grew towards Vachana Shasthra of twelfth century. He visited many villages in north Karnataka and collected old palm leaf manuscripts<nowiki> in which vachanas were written. But some parts of those manuscripts were either damaged or missing.

He was one of the foremost to translate vachanas into English and they were published in Indian Antiquity (1922). His contribution to Kannada literature lies primarily in the \"discovery\" of vachanas. It was part of his zealous research on the Lingayath literature. He collected, wrote and published more than ten thousand pages about Lingayath Literature<nowiki> out of which vachana vangmaya (literature) occupies a lion's share. He initiated the process of adapting precolonial vachanas to correspond to his contemporary sensibilities. He encouraged many young minds to take up studies on vachanas; collate and publish them.

Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals.\" The same scenario had been envisaged, with rather less enthusiasm, by Madison Grant in his 1916 \"The Passing of the Great Race\", calling for a eugenics program to prevent this development, and in a similar ideological context in Lothrop Stoddard's \"The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy\" in 1920.\n\nGottfried de Purucker was an author and theosophist who, when asked about intermarriage in 1930, said \"In answering your question very briefly, I can say simply this, that the time has not come when I would willingly suggest intermarriage; but I am in honesty bound to qualify that by saying that the race of the future will be a composite, composed of the many different races on earth today. Let us also remember that all men are ultimately of one blood.\"\n\nThe word \"miscegenation\" was used in an anonymous propaganda pamphlet printed in New York City in late 1863, entitled \"Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro\". The pamphlet purported to be in favor of interbreeding of whites and blacks until the races were indistinguishably mixed as mulattos, claiming that this was the goal of the United States Republican Party. The real authors were David Goodman Croly, managing editor of the \"New York World\", a Democratic Party paper, and George Wakeman, a \"World\" reporter. The pamphlet soon was exposed as an attempt to discredit the Republicans, the Lincoln administration, and the abolitionist movement by exploiting the fears and racial biases common among whites. Nonetheless, this pamphlet and variations on it were reprinted widely in communities on both sides of the American Civil War by opponents of Republicans.\n\nThe British colony of Maryland was the first to pass an anti-miscegenation law (1664). In the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century, many American states passed anti-miscegenation laws, often based on controversial interpretations of the Bible, particularly the story of Phinehas. Typically a felony, these laws prohibited the solemnization of weddings between persons of different races and prohibited the officiating of such ceremonies. Sometimes the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of miscegenation itself, but felony charges of adultery or fornication would be brought against them instead. Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii, and the federal District of Columbia did not pass anti-miscegenation laws. In 1883, the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Pace v. Alabama\".\n\nIn 1948, the California Supreme Court in \"Perez v. Sharp\" effectively repealed the California anti-miscegenation statutes, thereby making California the first state in the twentieth century to do so. In 1967, the remaining anti-miscegenation laws in 16 states were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in \"Loving v. Virginia\".\n\nIn Brazil, as much as 44% of the population classify themselves as Pardo (multiracial). They are typically a mix of White, Black and Native American.\n\nWilliam Quan Judge was a 19th century theosophist who wrote in his book Echoes from the Orient; \"We are preparing here in America a new race which will exhibit the perfection of the glories that I said were being slowly brought to the surface from the long forgotten past ... Here, and nowhere else, are to be found men and women of every race living together, being governed together, attacking nature and the problems of life together, and bringing forth children who combine, each one, two races. This process will go on until in the course of many generations there will be produced on the American continents an entirely new race; new bodies; new orders of intellect; new powers of the mind.\"\n\nIn the United States, the proportion of multiracial American children is growing. Interracial partnerships are rising, as are transracial adoptions. In 1990, about 14% of 18- and 19-year-olds, 12% of 20- and 21-year-olds, and 7% of 34- and 35-year-olds were involved in interracial relationships (Joyner and Kao, 2005). In 2010 in the United States, 15% of new marriages were interracial, with 9% of whites, 17% of blacks, 26% of Hispanics and 28% of Asians married outside of their race. Of the 275,000 new interracial marriages in 2010, 43% were white-mestizo, 14.4% were white-Asian, 11.9% were white-black and the rest were other combinations.\n\nAccording to anthropologist Henry Harpending, human populations are actually diverging from one another, as opposed to melding into a single population. Harpending stated \"Human races are evolving away from each other ... Genes are evolving fast in Europe, Asia and Africa, but almost all of these are unique to their continent of origin. We are getting less alike, not merging into a single, mixed humanity.\" <br>\n\n"}

Speech pathologists call the condition \"de\"-rhotacization, because the sounds lose their rhotic quality rather than becoming rhotic.\n\nRhotic sounds are usually the last ones a child masters. Some people never learn to produce them; they substitute other sounds, such as the velar approximant, the uvular approximant (often called the French \"R\"), and the uvular trill.\n\nIn English, the most common occurrence of this type is a pronunciation perceived as closer to [w] (typically, though, actually the labiodental approximant ), which is known as \"r\"-labialisation. This form of rhotacism has often been used in English-language media for comedic effect, since it evokes among English speakers a childlike way of pronouncing the letter R, an example being Elmer Fudd's pronunciation of \"rabbit\" ] as \"wabbit\" ] in \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons. Often, people with the condition are mistakenly referred to as a person with a lisp, which is a completely different condition.\n\nRhotacism is more common among speakers of languages that have a trilled R, such as Arabic, Bulgarian, Finnish, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish (except in the provinces of Skåne, Halland, Blekinge, Öland and southern Småland).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22075349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22075349", "title": "Sightline", "text": "Sightline\n\nA sightline (also sight line) or visual axis is a normally unobstructed line of sight between an intended observer (or spectator) and a subject of interest, such as a stage, arena, or monument. Sightlines are a particularly important consideration in theatre and stadium design, road junction layout and urban planning. In cities such as London, construction within sightlines is restricted to protect the key views of famous landmarks.\n\nSubjects that have a direct line of sight with one another are said to be \"intervisible\".\n\nGood sightlines allow spectators to see all areas of a venue stage or field of play. To ensure this designers utilize the C-value, defined as the vertical distance from a spectator's eyes to sightline of the spectator directly behind. The C-value is determined in part by the rake, that is, the upward slope of the seating. \n\nThe stadium bowl rake if based on consistent C-values will follow half of a parabola in section. The curvature will be greatest closest to the pitch and will become an increasingly flatter curve as it moves to the upper rows. As a general rule the rake or curve of the seating bowl will flatten as the first row of seats move away from the side-line for a constant C-value. It is impractical to make different step heights for every single row. In practice the riser height is the same for a set of 4 or 5 rows at the bottom of the bowl with the number of rows in each same height set increasing for higher up rows. The uppermost tier could have only 2 or even 1 different step heights.\n\nIt is the lowest rows of seats that are the most sensitive to the impact of the C-value because of the very flat view angle to the touch line. The higher seats can have a reduced C-value without impacting as seriously on the clear view of the field of play.\n\nSightline criteria in theaters can include: the \"isacoustic curve\" defined by John Scott Russell in 1838 and applied at the Auditorium Building in Chicago and the Emery Theatre in Cincinnati; alternate row sightlines where each patron sees between the heads of patrons in the row in front and over the heads of patrons in the second row in front; next row sightlines where each patron sees over the heads of patrons in the row immediately in front; and basic considerations like pointing the chairs more or less toward the performance, being able to see the conductor in the pit, being able to see other patrons, being able to see actors on elevated scenery, and not being obstructed by a wall, railing, column, ceiling overhang, loudspeaker cluster, or any other obstruction. The design of sightlines includes considerations of how much of the stage and scenery each patron can see. For example, can each patron see the top of the scenery or not, and can each patron see the whole stage floor or not? Design of sightlines is divided into two related exercises, vertical sightlines and horizontal sightlines. Design of proper sightlines includes resolving both technical and aesthetic issues. At issue is the emotional response of the audience: whether a performer can hold the audience's attention or not; whether the patron feels they had a \"good\" seat and their ticket was fairly priced or not; whether the audience gets the emotional impact of the performance or not; and whether the patron wants to come back and see another performance in that theater or not. Building codes restrict the maximum and minimum rise per row, limit the minimum width per row, limit the maximum deviation in the size of steps from row to row to achieve the curvature of the rake, and limit other aspects of sightline design.\n\nBooks on theater planning that discuss the design of sightlines.\n\nIt is recommended that a spectator's eye height must not be lower than 800 mm above the stage. However, in larger theatres it is acceptable to locate the eye height of the first row on the level of the stage.\n\nThe spectator view in modern stadia is optimised very carefully to balance the uninterrupted clear view to the field for every seat whilst not making the seating terraces any higher than necessary to satisfy structure, cost and safety considerations. This is done with careful modelling utilizing the C-Value to ensure the ideal rake or curvature of the seating bowl. C-values are improved with a steeper slope or moving the seating rows away from the focus point. Inadequate views result in spectators jumping up for a better view during exciting play. This is an annoyance to others and can lead to fights and in the context of large crowds this can be a serious safety threat. The maximum step height between terraces or rows is usually limited to 540mm. If this is exceeded then a continuous guardrail is required as protection against falling. Even with a 540mm terrace step many spectators become uncomfortable and start to feel the impact of vertigo. An ideal maximum terrace step height that will avoid most people feeling insecure is 450mm.\n\nThe C-Value considers the sightlines in the vertical plane. The sightlines in the horizontal plane need to be considered for the front row spectators in the instance where they look acutley sideways, typically adjacent far end corner flag. At the extreme end of the front row, spectators could have their view from one of their eyes blocked by the head of the adjacent spectator. During exciting play this can lead to spectators jumping up out of their seats to get a better view. A clear view for both eyes for all front row spectators can be achieved by the use of curved stands in plan. It can also be argued that with play that is already a long distance away a better view of the game is available on the big video screen.\n\nThe touch-line (or side-line) and the goal-line are considered the C-Value focus point in Stadia.\n\nThere should be a clear view of the playing field from all seats. Roof supports should be eliminated entirely from the seating area.\nIn calculating the sight lines it should be appreciated that advertising boards of 90–100 cm in height may be erected around the field at a distance of five metres from the touch lines and five metres behind the centre of the goal lines. FIFA ticketing carry out an assessment of all seats and those seats that have an obstructed view of the game will be classed obstructed view seats and will not be sold. Quite often these are the first few seats adjacent to the pitch with their view partially blocked by the advertising hoardings. This is an especially big problem with football stadiums that have running tracks around them. These seats are either covered with a fabric and not occupied during the game or the tickets are issued to non-paying spectators.\n\n6 cm absolute minimum\n\n9 cm recommended minimum\n\n12 cm optimum\n\nFIFA Football Stadium - Technical Recommendations and requirements - Page 111\n\nThe audience's sightline is an important aspect of the design of viewing venues. For theaters, an algorithm is used to check the sightline from a seat to determine if it is blocked. The development of better methods is the subject of continuing research. In 2011, Yeonhee Kim and Ghang Lee presented an algorithm to derive actual sight area in the early design stage of theater without producing a 3D model. The algorithm uses plan and cross sectional drawings to analyze view of audiences to resolve to address errors of the \"sight area rate\" algorithm which does not account for sightlines being blocked by the front-row seats in a theater.\n"}

Along with his teaching career, he led the modernist movement in Gujarati literature. He was prolific writer and he transformed the field of literary criticism.\n\nHe was born in Valod, a small town near Bardoli in South Gujarat on 30 May 1921. He did his schooling from Songadh and Gangadhara. He matriculated from Navsari in 1938. He completed his BA in 1943 and MA from Elphinstone College in 1945. In the same year, he started teaching at D. J. Singh College in Karachi and later joined Sardar Patel University, Vallabh Vidyanagar in 1947. From 1951, he served as a lecturer, professor and later as Head of the Gujarati Department at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara till his retirement in 1981.\n\nHis early life was spent at Songadh which influenced his life. At the age of eight, he secretly published his poem in \"Baljeevan\" magazine. He edited \"Falguni\" magazine in his college life. \"Upjati\" (1956) was his first published work. He had also edited \"Manisha\", \"Kshitij\", \"Etad\" and \"Uhapoh\" magazines.\n\nHe died on 6 September 1986 due to kidney failure at Nadiad.\n\nA strong opponent of romantic tendencies in literature, Joshi influenced many up-and-coming writers in the 1960s and 1970s. His personal essays \"are said to have introduced a new prose style in Gujarati literature,\" according to Gujarati scholar Sarala Jag Mohan. He was influenced by efforts of experimentation in western literature.\n\nHe was one of the chief exponents of experimentalist poetry in Gujarati, primarily through his literary criticism, rather than his poems. Under his influence, form, technique and structure became far more important considerations within Gujarati poetry. The torments of the individual and literary craftsmanship became more highly esteemed, but intelligibility, lyricism and musicality were valued less, as were social concerns of the writer and even the contents of the work, according to Deepak B. Mehta.\n\nExistentialism and phenomenology were prime interests of his.\n\nSuresh Joshi was a modernist author who led the modernist movement in Gujarati literature which emerged after 1955, the post-Gandhian era. He is recognized as the father of modern Gujarati literature and as the leader of avant-garde writers in Gujarati. According to Gujarati critic Bharat Mehta, the period of Gujarati literature from 1975 to 2000 was highly influenced by Suresh Joshi.\n\n\"Upjati\" (1956), \"Pratyancha\" (1961), \"Itara\" (1973) and \"Tathapi\" (1980) are his poetry collection. He withdrawn his first publication \"Upjati\" on his second publication. Through his poems, he introduced obscurity and ambiguity to Gujarati literature.\n\nHis four novels are collectively published as \"Kathachatushtay\". Two of them, \"Chhinnapatra\" (1965) and \"Maranottar\" (1973) were already published before. \"Vidula\" and \"Kathachakra\" were published before with other short stories but Joshi considered them as novels and published again with other two. \"Chhinnapatra\" was translated into English by Tridip Suhrud as \"Crumpled letters\" (1998).\n\nHe was very experimental in novellas. He transformed the genre in Gujarati literature by his continued experimentation and esthetics. \"Grihapravesh\" (1957), \"Biji Thodik Vartao\" (1958), \"Apich\" (1965), \"Na Tatra Suryo Bhati\" (1967), \"Ekda Naimisharanye\" (1980) are his collection of stories which include 62 novellas. His 21 stories were collected in \"Maniti Anmaniti\" (1982), edited by Shirish Panchal. He promoted a theory of fiction known as \"Ghatanavilop\" which focuses on suggestive potential of language instead of plot element in fiction.\n\n\"Janantike\" (1965) is his first collection of essays. His other essay collections are \"Idam Sarvam\" (1971), \"Ahobat Kim Ashcharyam\" (1975), \"Iti Me Iti\" (1987). \"Bhavyami\" (1984) includes selected essays edited by Shirish Panchal from his more than thousand essays. \"Janantike\" was translated into English by V Y Kantak as \"Intimated Asides\" (1995).\n\nHe was a reformer in field of literary criticism. His first work of citicism \"Kinchit\" (1960) rebelled against established norms. \"Gujarati Kavitano Aswad\" (1962), \"Kavyacharcha\" (1971), \"Kathopkathan\", \"Shrunavantu\" (1972), \"Arunyarudan\" (1976), \"Chintayami Manasa\" (1983), \"Ashtamoahyay\" (1984) are his other collections of criticism.\n\n\"Madhyakalin Gyanmargi Kavyadharani Bhumika\" (1978) is his research work. \"Jananti Ye Kimapi\" (1984) is collection of six essays edited by him which focuses on new movement in literary criticism. He edited some anthologies; \" Navonmesh\" (1971), \"Narharini Gyangeeta\" (1978), \"Gujarati Sarjanatmak Gadya: Ek Sankalan\" (1981), \"Vastana Pado\" (1983). \"Parakiya\" (1975) his collection of translation of fine world poetry. \"Dhire Vahe Chhe Don\" Volume I (1960) and \"Bhonytaliyano Adami\" (1967) are translations of Russian novels. \"Shikari Bandook ane Hajar Saraso\" (1975) is translation of Japanese stories. \"Ameriki Tunki Varta\" (1967) is translation of \"The Short Story in America\" by Raymond B. West. \"Amerikana Sahityano Itihas\" (1965) is translation of book by Marks Cliff. He translated essays of Rabindranath Tagore in \"Panchamrut\" (1949) and \"Sanchay\" (1963).\n\nHe was awarded Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak in 1971. He refused to accept Sahitya Akademi Award in 1983 which was awarded him for \"Chintayami Manasa\". He said\nthat,\"The book contains nothing more than some stray essay. It is only critical articles based on European and American criticism, and not reflects his original critical thinking.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1354324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1354324", "title": "Trunk versus toll telephony", "text": "Trunk versus toll telephony\n\nIn the US, under the purview of the Bell System, local telephone calls were typically unmetered and included in flat rate billing. The term toll calling was adopted \nfor long distance calls which were subject to toll charges.\n\nIn the UK, all calls were chargeable and the term trunk calling was adopted for long distance calls. Initially a trunk call had to be booked in advance and a switchboard operator called the subscriber when the call set-up was completed; a process known as 'delay working'. Due to increasing demands for trunk calls from London and the associated delays in connecting them, calls to exchanges adjacent to the London director area were transferred to a new Toll exchange opened on 17 September 1921. Calls to toll area exchanges were connected on-demand whilst the originating subscriber waited thus improving service and reducing operator costs. The London Toll Area boundary was extended in 1923 and again in 1928, so that eventually Southampton, Portsmouth, Reading, Bedford, Colchester and the whole of Kent and Sussex were included. The system was later introduced to other large cities and remained in use until the late 1950s when, with the advent of Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD), Toll was eventually phased out. The name \"toll\" was probably taken from US usage.\n\nIn the London telephone area, calls to subscribers who were not serviced by Director telephone systems within local call-charging range of the London Director exchange area were carried by tandem exchange \"Toll A\": a subscriber would dial a prefix code, typically two letters plus zero, one or two figures (e.g. DA, EP5, LK85) followed by the number of the other subscriber on the fringe non-director exchange. To avoid confusion, three-letter dialling codes were not used for calls from the director area to the fringe area, even if they corresponded to the same holes in the dial (e.g. the Hoddesdon and Mogador codes were HO3 and MO4 respectively). Calls from fringe non-director exchanges to numbers within the director area were passed in two ways. For those to director exchanges near the area boundary adjacent to the non-director exchange, subscribers were often given numerical codes to dial, and told to follow the code with the numerical portion of the other subscriber's number: these direct routings permitted the use of short unamplified lines. For director exchanges remote from the area boundary, the subscriber was told to dial a code (typically 7, 87 or exceptionally 1), to wait for a second dialling tone, and to follow this with the three letters and four figures of the other number. These calls were handled by tandem exchange \"Toll B\", from which the second dialling tone originated. To have a second dialling tone in this way was very unusual on the PSTN in the UK, although the French and Belgian PTTs had a similar instruction for when their customers made international calls.\n\nThe distinction between \"trunk\" and \"toll\" became irrelevant when subscriber trunk dialling (STD) was introduced.\n\n"}

The testimony of a witness who testifies against co-conspirator(s) may be important evidence.\nIn the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms, the term is to turn Queen's or King's evidence, depending on the sex of the reigning monarch. The term \"turning approver\" or \"turn king's approver\" was also historically used; an approver \"not only admitted his own guilt to a crime but also incriminated his accomplices both past and present\" in exchange for avoiding a death sentence (and obtaining a lesser penalty, such as life imprisonment or abjuration of the realm) or improving prison conditions.\n\nIn American parlance, a defendant who agrees to cooperate with prosecutors and give information against co-conspirators (often those with greater culpability) is also said to flip.\n\nWitnesses who have turned state's evidence have been important in organized crime cases in the United States, such as those against La Cosa Nostra. The first \"mafiosi\" who turned state's evidence, such as Joseph Valachi and Jimmy Fratianno, did so in response to threats on their life from Mafia associates; later cooperators were motivated to cooperate in order to avoid heavy sentences, such as those provided for under the RICO Act. Some who turned state's evidence were permitted to participate in the Witness Security Program (WITSEC). Among the highest-ranking Mafia members to ever turn state's evidence was Salvatore Gravano (\"Sammy the Bull\"), an underboss of the Gambino crime family who pleaded guilty to 19 murders and agreed to testify against family boss John Gotti. (Gravano was sentenced to 20 years; Gotti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1992). Joseph Massino was also the first boss of one of the Five Families in New York City to turn state's evidence.\n\nThe incentives to turn state's evidence, or to not to do so, are explored in the famous prisoner's dilemma, created by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "400582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=400582", "title": "Typographic ligature", "text": "Typographic ligature\n\nIn writing and typography, a ligature occurs where two or more graphemes or letters are joined as a single glyph. An example is the character \"æ\" as used in English, in which the letters \"a\" and \"e\" are joined. The common ampersand (&) developed from a ligature in which the handwritten Latin letters \"e\" and \"t\" (spelling \"et\", from the Latin for \"and\") were combined.\n\nThe origin of typographical ligatures comes from the invention of writing with a stylus on fibrous material (like paper) or clay. Businessmen especially who needed a way to speed up the process of written communication found that conjoining letters and abbreviating words for lay use was more convenient for record keeping and transaction than the bulky long forms. The earliest known script, Sumerian cuneiform, includes many cases of character combinations that, over time, gradually evolve from ligatures into separately recognizable characters. Ligatures figure prominently in many historical manuscripts, notably the Brahmic abugidas, or the bind rune of the Migration Period Germanic runic inscriptions.\n\nMedieval scribes who wrote in Latin increased their writing speed by combining characters and by introducing notational abbreviations. Others conjoined letters for aesthetic purposes. For example, in blackletter, letters with right-facing bowls (b, o, and p) and those with left-facing bowls (c, e, o, d, g and q) were written with the facing edges of the bowls superimposed. In many script forms, characters such as h, m, and n had their vertical strokes superimposed. Scribes also used notational abbreviations to avoid having to write a whole character in one stroke. Manuscripts in the fourteenth century employed hundreds of such abbreviations.\n\nModifications to script bodies like these usually originate from legal, business and monastic sources, with the emphasis shifting from business to monastic sources by around the 9th and 10th centuries.\n\nIn hand writing, a ligature is made by joining two or more characters in atypical fashion by merging their parts or by writing one above or inside the other. While in printing, a ligature is a group of characters that is typeset as a unit, and the characters do not have to be joined. For example, in some cases the fi ligature prints the letters f and i with a greater separation than when they are typeset as separate letters. When printing with movable type was invented around 1450, typefaces included many ligatures and additional letters, as they were based on handwriting. Ligatures made printing with movable type easier because one block would replace frequent combinations of letters and also allowed more complex and interesting character designs which would otherwise collide with one another.\n\nLigatures began to fall out of use due to their complexity in the 20th century. Sans serif typefaces, increasingly used for body text, generally avoid ligatures, though notable exceptions include Gill Sans and Futura. Inexpensive phototypesetting machines in the 1970s (which did not require journeyman knowledge or training to operate) also generally avoid them. A few, however, became characters in their own right, see below the sections about German ß, various Latin accented letters, & et al..\n\nThe trend against digraph use was further strengthened by the desktop publishing revolution starting around 1977 with the production of the Apple II. Early computer software in particular had no way to allow for ligature substitution (the automatic use of ligatures where appropriate), while most new digital typefaces did not include ligatures. As most of the early PC development was designed for the English language (which already treated ligatures as optional at best) dependence on ligatures did not carry over to digital. Ligature use fell as the number of traditional hand compositors and hot metal typesetting machine operators dropped due to the mass production of the IBM Selectric brand of electric typewriter in 1961. A designer active in the period commented: \"some of the world's greatest typefaces were quickly becoming some of the world's worst fonts.\"\n\nLigatures have grown in popularity over the last 20 years due to an increasing interest in creating typesetting systems that evoke arcane designs and classical scripts. One of the first computer typesetting programs to take advantage of computer-driven typesetting (and later laser printers) was Donald Knuth's TeX program. Now the standard method of mathematical typesetting, its default fonts are explicitly based on nineteenth-century styles. Many new fonts feature extensive ligature sets; these include FF Scala, Seria and others by Martin Majoor and Hoefler Text by Jonathan Hoefler. Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko contains a particularly large set to allow designers to create dramatic display text with a feel of antiquity.\nA parallel use of ligatures is seen in the creation of script fonts that join letterforms to simulate handwriting effectively. This trend is caused in part by the increased support for other languages and alphabets in modern computing, many of which use ligatures somewhat extensively. This has caused the development of new digital typesetting techniques such as OpenType, and the incorporation of ligature support into the text display systems of macOS, Windows, and applications like Microsoft Office. An increasing modern trend is to use a \"Th\" ligature which reduces spacing between these letters to make it easier to read, a trait infrequent in metal type.\n\nToday, modern font programming divides ligatures into three groups, which can be activated separately: standard, contextual and historical. Standard ligatures are needed to allow the font to display without errors such as character collision. Designers sometimes find contextual and historic ligatures desirable for creating effects or to evoke an old-fashioned print look.\n\nMany ligatures combine f with the following letter. A particularly prominent example is ﬁ (or fi, rendered with two normal letters). The tittle of the i in many typefaces collides with the hood of the f when placed beside each other in a word, and are combined into a single glyph with the tittle absorbed into the f. Other ligatures with the letter f include fj, fl (ﬂ), ff (ﬀ), ffi (ﬃ), and ffl (ﬄ). Ligatures for fa, fe, fo, fr, fs, ft, fb, fh, fu, fy, and for f followed by a full stop, comma, or hyphen, as well as the equivalent set for the doubled ff and fft are also used, though are less common.\n\nThese arose because with the usual type sort for lowercase f, the end of its hood is on a kern, which would be damaged by collision with raised parts of the next letter.\n\nLigatures crossing the morpheme boundary of a composite word are sometimes considered incorrect, especially in official German orthography as outlined in the Duden. An English example of this would be ff in \"shelfful\"; a German example would be (\"boat trip\"). Some computer programs (such as TeX) provide a setting to disable ligatures for German, while some users have also written macros to identify which ligatures to disable.\n\nTurkish distinguishes dotted and dotless \"I\". In a ligature with \"f\" (in words such as and ), this contrast would be obscured. The fi ligature is therefore not used in Turkish typography, and neither are other ligatures like that for fl, which would be rare anyway.\nRemnants of the ligatures ſʒ/ſz (\"sharp s\", ) and tʒ/tz (\"sharp t\", ) from Fraktur, a family of German blackletter typefaces, originally mandatory in Fraktur but now employed only stylistically, can be seen to this day on street signs for city squares whose name contains or ends in . Instead, the \"sz\" ligature has merged into a single character, the German ß – see below.\n\nSometimes, ligatures for st (ﬆ), ſt (ﬅ), ch, ct, Qu and Th are used (e.g. in the typeface Linux Libertine).\n\nBesides conventional ligatures, in the metal type era some newspapers commissioned custom condensed single sorts for the names of common long names that might appear in news headings, such as \"Eisenhower\", \"Chamberlain\", and others. In these cases the characters did not appear combined, just more tightly spaced than if printed conventionally.\n\nThe German (also called the , meaning \"sharp s\") ß is an official letter of the alphabet in Germany and Austria. There is no general consensus about its history. Its name (meaning S-Z) suggests a connection of \"long s and z\" (ſʒ) but the Latin script also knows a ligature of \"long s over round s\" (ſs). The latter is used as the design principle for the character in most of today's typefaces. Since German was mostly set in blackletter typefaces until the 1940s, and those typefaces were rarely set in uppercase, a capital version of the never came into common use, even though its creation has been discussed since the end of the 19th century. Therefore, the common replacement in uppercase typesetting was originally SZ ( \"measure\" → , different from \"mass\" → ) and later SS ( → ). The SS replacement is currently the only valid spelling according to the official orthography (the so-called ) in Germany and Austria. For German writing in Switzerland, the ß is omitted altogether in favour of ss, hence the German slur about the Swiss: \"»Wie trinken die Schweizer Bier? — In Massen.«\" (\"How do the Swiss drink beer? — In mass\" instead of two other meanings if it had been written as \"in Maßen\": one is \"not too much\", the other to drink out of jugs that hold exactly one Maß of volume).\nSince 2008, the capital version (ẞ) of the Eszett character is part of Unicode and appears in more and more typefaces. The new character has not yet entered mainstream writing. A new standardized German keyboard layout (DIN 2137-T2) has included the capital ß since 2012. Since the end of 2010, the suggests the new upper case character for \"ß\" rather than replacing it with \"SS\" or \"SZ\" for geographical names.\n\nIn the colonial orthography created by John Eliot, later used in the first Bible printed in the Americas, the Massachuset-language published in 1663, although Eliot had previously translated catechisms and published books of the Bible as well as trained Indians to become literate who in turn trained others. A prominent feature of the new orthography was his use of the double-o ligature \"ꝏ\" to represent the \"oo\" of \"food\" as opposed to the \"oo\" of \"hook\", although Eliot himself used \"oo\" and \"ꝏ\" interchangeably. In the orthography in use since 2000 in the Wampanoag communities participating in the Wopanaak Language Reclamation Project, the ligature was replaced with the numeral 8, partly because of its ease in typesetting and display as well as similarity to the o-u ligature Ȣ used in Abenaki. For example, \"seepꝏash\" (colonial) (\"seep8ash\") (WLRP, modern).\n\nAs the letter W is an addition to the Latin alphabet that originated in the seventh century, the phoneme it represents was formerly written in various ways. In Old English, the runic letter wynn (Ƿ) was used, but Norman influence forced wynn out of use. By the 14th century, the \"new\" letter \"W\", originated as two Vs or Us joined together, developed into a legitimate letter with its own position in the alphabet. Because of its relative youth compared to other letters of the alphabet, only a few European languages (English, Dutch, German, Polish, Welsh, Maltese, and Walloon) use the letter in native words.\n\nThe character Æ (lower case æ; in ancient times named ) when used in the Danish, Norwegian, or Icelandic languages, or Old English, is not a typographic ligature. It is a distinct letter—a vowel—and when alphabetised, is given a different place in the alphabetic order. In modern English orthography Æ is not considered an independent letter but a spelling variant, for example: \"encyclopædia\" versus \"encyclopaedia\" or \"encyclopedia\".\n\nÆ comes from Mediæval Latin, where it was an optional ligature in some words, for example, \"Æneas\". It is still found as a variant in English and French, but the trend has recently been towards printing the A and E separately. Similarly, Œ and œ, while normally printed as ligatures in French, are replaced by component letters if technical restrictions require it.\n\nIn German orthography, the umlauted vowels ä, ö, and ü historically arose from \"ae\", \"oe\", \"ue\" ligatures (strictly, from superscript \"e\", viz. \"aͤ\", \"oͤ\", \"uͤ\"). It is common practice to replace them with \"ae, oe, ue\" digraphs when the diacritics are unavailable, for example in electronic conversation. Phone books treat umlauted vowels as equivalent to the relevant digraph (so that a name Müller will appear at the same place as if it were spelled Mueller; German surnames have a strongly fixed orthography, either a name is spelled with \"ü\" or with \"ue\"); however, the alphabetic order used in other books treats them as equivalent to the simple letters \"a\", \"o\" and \"u\". The convention in Scandinavian languages and Finnish is different: there the umlaut vowels are treated as independent letters with positions at the end of the alphabet.\n\nThe \"ring\" diacritic used in vowels such as å likewise originated as an o-ligature. Before the replacement of the older \"aa\" with \"å\" became a practice, an \"a\" with another \"a\" on top (aͣ) could sometimes be used, for example in Johannes Bureus's, \"Runa: ABC-Boken\" (1611). The uo ligature ů in particular saw use in Early Modern High German, but it merged in later Germanic languages with u (e.g. MHG , ENHG \"fuͦß\", Modern German \"foot\"). It survives in Czech, where it is called .\n\nThe \"tilde\" diacritic, used in Spanish as part of the letter \"ñ\", representing the palatal nasal consonant, and in Portuguese for nasalization of a vowel, originated in ligatures where \"n\" followed the base letter: → . Similarly, the circumflex in French spelling stems from the ligature of a silent \"s\". The French, Portuguese, Catalan and old Spanish letter ç represents a \"c\" over a \"z\"; the diacritic's name cedilla means \"little zed\".\n\nThe letter hwair (ƕ), used only in transliteration of the Gothic language, resembles a \"hw\" ligature. It was introduced by philologists around 1900 to replace the digraph \"hv\" formerly used to express the phoneme in question, e.g. by Migne in the 1860s ( vol. 18).\n\nThe Byzantines had a unique o-u ligature (Ȣ) that, while originally based on the Greek alphabet's ο-υ, carried over into Latin alphabets as well. This ligature is still seen today on icon artwork in Greek Orthodox churches, and sometimes in graffiti or other forms of informal or decorative writing.\n\nGha (ƣ), a rarely used letter based on Q and G, was misconstrued by the ISO to be an OI ligature due to its appearance, and is thus known (to the ISO and, in turn, Unicode) as \"Oi\".\n\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet formerly used ligatures to represent affricate consonants, of which six are encoded in Unicode: and . One fricative consonant is still represented with a ligature: , and the extensions to the IPA contain three more: , and .\n\nThe Initial Teaching Alphabet, a short-lived alphabet intended for young children, used a number of ligatures to represent long vowels: ꜷ, æ, œ, ᵫ, ꭡ, and ligatures for ee, ou and oi that are not encoded in Unicode. Ligatures for consonants also existed, including ligatures of ʃh, ʈh, wh, ʗh, ng and a reversed t with h (neither the reversed t nor any of the consonant ligatures are in Unicode).\n\nRarer ligatures also exist, such as ꜳ; Ꜵꜵ; Ꜷ; Ꜹꜹ; Ꜻꜻ (barred \"AV\"); Ꜽꜽ; Ꝏꝏ, which is used in medieval Nordic languages for (a long close-mid back rounded vowel), as well as in some orthographies of the Massachusett language to represent (a long close back rounded vowel); ᵺ; Ỻỻ, which was used in Medieval Welsh to represent (the voiceless lateral fricative); Ꜩꜩ; ᴂ; ᴔ; and ꭣ.\n\nThe most common ligature is the ampersand &. This was originally a ligature of E and t, forming the Latin word \"et\", meaning \"and\". It has exactly the same use in French and in English. The ampersand comes in many different forms. Because of its ubiquity, it is generally no longer considered a ligature, but a logogram.\n\nLike many other ligatures, it has at times been considered a letter (e.g., in early Modern English); in English it is pronounced \"and\", not \"et\", except in the case of \"&c\", pronounced \"et cetera\". In most fonts, it does not immediately resemble the two letters used to form it, although certain typefaces (such as Trebuchet MS) use the design & in the form of a ligature.\n\nSimilarly, the dollar sign $ possibly originated as a ligature (for \"pesos\", although there are other theories as well) but is now a logogram.\n\nThe Spanish peseta was sometimes symbolized by a ligature ₧ (from Pts), and the French franc was often symbolized by an F-r ligature (₣).\n\nAlchemy used a set of mostly standardized symbols, many of which were ligatures: 🜇 (AR, for aqua regia), 🜈 (S inside a V, for aqua vitae), 🝫 (MB, for \"balneum Mariae\" [Mary's bath], a double boiler), 🝬 (VB, for \"balneum vaporis\", a steam bath), and 🝛 (\"aaa\", for amalgam). In astronomy, the dwarf planet Pluto is symbolized by a PL ligature, ♇. A different PL ligature, ⅊, represents the property line in surveying. In engineering diagrams, a CL ligature, ℄, represents the center line of an object.\n\nDigraphs, such as \"ll\" in Spanish or Welsh, are not ligatures in the general case as the two letters are displayed as separate glyphs: although written together, when they are joined in handwriting or italic fonts the base form of the letters is not changed and the individual glyphs remain separate. Like some ligatures discussed above, these digraphs may or may not be considered individual letters in their respective languages. Until the 1994 spelling reform, the digraphs \"ch\" and \"ll\" were considered separate letters in Spanish for collation purposes. Catalan makes a difference between \"Spanish ll\" or palatalized l, written \"ll\" as in \"llei\" (law), and \"French ll\" or geminated l, written \"l·l\" as in \"col·lega\" (colleague).\n\nThe difference can be illustrated with the French digraph , which is composed of the ligature and the simplex letter .\n\nDutch , however, is somewhat more ambiguous. Depending on the standard used, it can be considered a digraph, a ligature or a letter in itself, and its upper case and lower case forms are often available as a single glyph with a distinctive ligature in several professional fonts (e.g. Zapfino). Sans serif uppercase glyphs, popular in the Netherlands, typically use a ligature resembling a with a broken left-hand stroke. Adding to the confusion, Dutch handwriting can render (which is not found in native Dutch words, but occurs in words borrowed from other languages) as a -glyph without the dots in its lowercase form and the in its uppercase form looking virtually identical (only slightly bigger). When written/typed as two separate letters, both should be capitalized – or not – to form a correctly spelled word, like or (ice).\n\nLigatures are not limited to Latin script:\n\nWritten Chinese has a long history of creating new characters by merging parts or wholes of other Chinese characters. However, a few of these combinations do not represent morphemes but retain the original multi-character (multiple morpheme) reading and are therefore not considered true characters themselves. In Chinese, these ligatures are called () or (); see polysyllabic Chinese characters for more.\n\nOne popular ligature used on decorations used for Chinese Lunar New Year is a combination of the four characters for (), meaning \"ushering in wealth and fortune\" and used as a popular New Year's greeting.\nIn 1924, (; 1898–1967) created the ligature from two of the three characters (), meaning \"library\". Although it does have an assigned pronunciation of and appears in many dictionaries, it is not a morpheme and cannot be used as such in Chinese. Instead, it is usually considered a graphic representation of .\n\nIn recent years, a Chinese internet meme, the Grass Mud Horse, has had such a ligature associated with it combining the three relevant Chinese characters , , and ().\n\nSimilar to the ligatures were several \"two-syllable Chinese characters\" () created in the 19th century as Chinese characters for SI units. In Chinese these units are disyllabic and standardly written with two characters, as \"centimeter\" ( centi-, meter) or \"kilowatt\". However, in the 19th century these were often written via compound characters, pronounced disyllabically, such as for or for – some of these characters were also used in Japan, where they were pronounced with borrowed European readings instead. These have now fallen out of general use, but are occasionally seen.\n\nThe OpenType font format includes features for associating multiple glyphs to a single character, used for ligature substitution. Typesetting software may or may not implement this feature, even if it is explicitly present in the font's metadata. XeTeX is a TeX typesetting engine designed to make the most of such advanced features. This type of substitution used to be needed mainly for typesetting Arabic texts, but ligature lookups and substitutions are being put into all kinds of Western Latin OpenType fonts. In OpenType, there are standard codice_1, historical codice_2, contextual codice_3, discretionary codice_4 and required codice_5 ligatures. These can be enabled or disabled in CSS3 using codice_6.\n\nOpinion is divided over whether it is the job of writers or typesetters to decide where to use ligatures. TeX is an example of a computer typesetting system that makes use of ligatures automatically. The Computer Modern Roman typeface provided with TeX includes the five common ligatures ff, fi, fl, ffi, and ffl. When TeX finds these combinations in a text, it substitutes the appropriate ligature, unless overridden by the typesetter.\n\nCSS supports codice_7. codice_8, codice_9, codice_10 and codice_11 are supported.\n\nThis table below shows discrete letter pairs on the left, the corresponding Unicode ligature in the middle column, and the Unicode code point on the right. Provided you are using an operating system and browser that can handle Unicode, and have the correct Unicode fonts installed, some or all of these will display correctly. See also the provided graphic.\n\nUnicode maintains that ligaturing is a presentation issue rather than a character definition issue, and that, for example, \"if a modern font is asked to display 'h' followed by 'r', and the font has an 'hr' ligature in it, it can display the ligature.\" Accordingly, the use of the special Unicode ligature characters is \"discouraged\", and \"no more will be encoded in any circumstances\". (Unicode has continued to add ligatures, but only in such cases that the ligatures were used as distinct letters in a language or could be interpreted as standalone symbols.) Note, however, that ligatures such as æ and œ are not used to replace arbitrary \"ae\" or \"oe\" sequences; it is incorrect to write \"does\" as \"dœs\".\n\nNotably, Microsoft Word does not enable ligatures by default, partly for backward compatibility reasons due to its long history. This can be changed from the Advanced tab of the Font dialog box.\n\nAlso, there are separate code points for the digraph DZ and for the Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian digraphs DŽ, LJ, and NJ. They are not ligatures but digraphs. See Digraphs in Unicode.\n\n\nU+0238 and U+0239 are called digraphs, but are actually ligatures.\n\nFour \"ligature ornaments\" are included from U+1F670 to U+1F673 in the Ornamental Dingbats block, regular and bold variants of ℯT (script e and T) ɛT (open E and T).\n\nTypographic ligatures are used in a form of contemporary art, as can be illustrated by Chinese artist Xu Bing's work in which he combines Latin letters to form characters that resemble Chinese.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37287959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37287959", "title": "Tîrî language", "text": "Tîrî language\n\nTiri (Ciri, Tĩrĩ), or Mea (\"Ha Mea\"), is an Oceanic language of New Caledonia.\n\nTîrî has two types of pronouns: personal pronouns, which make reference to person, number and case, and impersonal pronouns, which only have one respective form and are more restricted in their use (Osumi, 1995, p. 38).\n\nLike all other nominals in Tîrî, pronouns can occupy various positions throughout the clause (Osumi, 1995, p. 37). They may appear as the nominal subject of the verb, marked by the subject marker \"nrâ\" and agreeing in person and number with the subject pronoun in the predicate; the object of a verb; the object of a preposition; or the head of a predicate (Osumi, 1995, pp. 37–38).\n\nWhen they appear within the verb phrase, personal pronouns show agreement in person and number with the nominal subject that optionally follows the predicate (Osumi, 1995, p. 38).\n\nPersonal pronouns in Tîrî also mark listener clusivity in the first person non-singular, and are generally used for human referents (Osumi, 1995, p. 39). The below example shows appropriate usage of the third person singular nrâ (not to be confused with the latter nrâ, which is acting as a subject marker for the optional nominal subject toni).\n\nAlthough the third person pronoun can be used for non-human entities (while the first and second person pronouns generally only refer to humans), speakers tend to use it in its singular form even when there is more than one referent, as seen below (Osumi, 1995, p. 39).\n\nAs indicated in the table above, Tîrî pronouns change form depending on whether they are being used as subjective, objective or free forms, the latter encompassing a variety of other pronoun usages, such as pronouns that have been topicalized and occur sentence-initially, as seen below (Osumi, 1995, pp. 39–40).\n\nWhile they are classified as pronouns as they fill the subject pronoun slot, Tîrî's two impersonal pronouns show less flexibility than personal pronouns. They do not show any distinction for person or number and occur only in their respective forms of \"hêrrê\" and \"va\", are unable to appear anywhere other than the subject pronoun position (the first element in the verb phrase), and are never followed by a nominal subject (Osumi, 1995, p. 41).\n\nSpeakers use \"hêrrê\" to refer to any number of unspecified entities when they do not wish to or are not concerned with specifying a referent as the agent of an action (Osumi, 1995, p. 41), as in the example below.\n\nThis contrasts with the below example, which is more likely to be used by a speaker who wishes to imply that a particular person has committed the same act (Osumi, 1995, p. 42).\n\nWhile \"hêrrê\" is typically used to refer to humans, the impersonal pronoun \"va\" is used similarly to refer to non-human referents, though this is not always the case (Osumi, 1995, p. 43). \"Va\" behaves much as the English pronouns \"it\" and \"that\" insofar as they can refer to both particular things (e.g. \"Did it bite you?\"; \"What's that over there?\") as well as propositions (e.g. \"It's the truth.\"; \"That's a lie.\"), as demonstrated below (Osumi, 1995, p. 43).\n\nSubject pronouns may be used in conjunction with the tense-aspect markers \"ei\" 'future' and \"a\" 'perfect, actual, definite', in which case a number of pronouns may change their phonological form (see the below example, in which the second person singular \"ke\" has been combined with \"a\") (Osumi, 1995, p. 170).\n\nTîrî, like most Oceanic languages, exhibits many types of possessive constructions, including possessive prepositions, possessive classifiers and bound-form nouns (Osumi, 1995, pp. 144). Classic possessive constructions involve two nominals that indicate the referent of one is possessed by the other. Tîrî has two types of possessive relationships, inalienable possession and alienable possession (Osumi, 1995, pp. 145). Inalienable possession describes an inherent relationship between two referents such as kinship, while alienable possession describes a non-inherent relationship such as temporary ownership or voluntary association (Osumi, 1995, pp. 145).\n\nTable 1: Summary of Possession in Tîrî (Osumi, 1995, pp. 155).\nIn Tîrî, alienable possession can occur in two ways. The first is when the noun possessed is followed by a possessive preposition and then by a pronominal or nominal processor (Osumi, 1995, pp. 145). The second is when the noun possessed occurs in apposition with a possessive classifier (Osumi, 1995, pp. 145).\n\nPrepositions are included in a closed set of grammatical words that are placed immediately before a noun phrase and express a syntactic relationship between the noun phrase and a predicate or another noun phrase (Osumi, 1995, pp. 145).\n\nThere are three possessive prepositional markers in Tiri: \"nrâ\", \"rre/rrê\", and \"ò\" and they occur between two nominals in the following structure.\n\nNP nrâ, rre/rrê, ò NP (Osumi, 1995, p. 145).\n\nTable 2: Tîrî Possessive prepositional morphemes (Osumi, 1995, p. 145).\n\n\"nrâ\" functions as both a subject and possessive marker when it precedes a noun phrase. As a possessive marker, it links the possessor to the preceding noun phrase, suggesting temporary possession (Osumi, 1995, p. 145). In Tîrî, the majority of nouns can occur with \"nrâ.\"\n\n\"An example of nrâ:\"\nThe possessive marker variants \"rre/rrê\" are restricted to the nouns, \"mwâ\" ‘hut’, \"wâ\" ‘boat’ and \"ò\" ‘pot’ (Osumi, 1995, p. 146).\n\n\"An example of rrê:\"\nThe possessed noun phrases that can occur with prepositions \"ò\" are limited to \"nre\" ‘fire, firewood’ or compounds with \"nre\": \"mee-nre\" ‘habitation’, \"pwò-nre\" ‘touch’, and \"mwârrâ-nre\" ‘fire flame’ (Osumi, 1995, p. 147). The possessive relationship expressed by ò is related to fire, with the purpose of warming oneself or cooking something.\n\n\"An example of ò:\"\nIn these examples, the possessive prepositions, \"nrâ\", \"rrê\" and \"ò\" are between two nominals, as in the structure above.\n\nAnother type of alienability is in constructions where the possessed nouns occur in apposition with a possessive classifier. Possessive classifiers are always either bound to pronominal or nominal possessors and they function to determine the nature of possession rather than to classify it (Osumi, 1995, p. 49). In Tîrî, unlike other languages, any noun can occur with a possessive classifier. They consist of the following: \"e-,\" \"ere-\", \"hwee-\", \"odho-\", \"hwiie-\", \"êê-\" and \"hêê-\" (Osumi, 1995, p. 49).\n\nTable 3: Tîrî Possessive classifiers morphemes (Osumi, 1995, p. 50).\nIn Tîrî, the possessive classifier can be placed before or after the noun possessed, as seen below (Osumi, 1995, p. 149).\n\nNP POSS.CLASSIFIER NP \n\nOR,\n\nPOSS.CLASSIFIER NP NP \n\nExamples of the possessive classifier in between two NPs:\n\nExamples of the possessive classifier preceding two NPs:\n\nNouns that occur with inalienable possession are generally ones whose referents have no independent existence but are related to an entity (Osumi, 1995, p. 152). In Tiri, inalienable possession is the juxtaposition of two nouns in the following structure:\n\nNP – NP (Osumi, 1995, p. 152).\n\nThere are two types of bound-form nouns, bound nouns and link nouns. This class is inalienable as that the referents of the nouns are possessed in some inextricable way, for example, kinship and body parts. In most cases, the possessor has no control over the possession.\n\nBound nouns are those that either has possessive pronoun suffixes or are bound to a nominal possessor (Osumi, 1995, p. 59). They include nouns referring to kinship, body or plants or other inanimate parts, secretions or of the body or plant, personal attributes or properties and the effects or origins of human affairs (Osumi, 1995, p. 153).\n\nThey can also be bound to another root either noun or verb, in compound constructions (Osumi, 1995, p. 59). For example of \"afiraa\" 'wife', where it is bound to the third person singular possessive \"nrî\":\n\nTable 4: Examples of Bound nouns (Osumi, 1995, p. 60).\n\n\"An example of the body part mouth with the first person singular rò:\" \nLink nouns referents belong to similar categories of bound nouns such as kinship and body or plants or other inanimate parts. They are obligatorily linked to a pronoun or head of a pronominal phrase, where the possessive relationship is demonstrated by a link morpheme \"-nrâ-\" (Osumi, 1995, p. 62)\".\" The construction has this following form:\n\nNP – nrâ – NP (Osumi, 1995, p. 154).\n\nWhen the possessor is the first person singular, the link morpheme \"-nrâ-\" is often omitted as seen below. \n\"-nrâ-\" is also identical in form to the general possessive prepositions. Therefore, link nouns are alike to free common nouns that are followed by the possessive \"nrâ.\" Both constructions are difficult to differentiate, the link nouns depict inalienable possession and cannot be separated from their possessor by an element (Osumi, 1995, p. 154).\n\nThis subclass of nouns includes some from the words in the following list.\n\nTable 5: Examples of Link nouns (Osumi, 1995, p. 60).\nThere can also be morphological complex link nouns, which involve a bound noun or a location noun in the first position, with the link noun in the second (Osumi, 1995, p. 64).\n\nAlthough the examples represented are not comprehensive for both bound and link nouns, they show that there is no structural distinction between the two subclasses. Analysis of a Tîrî corpus by Midori Osumi (1995, p. 65) found that there were thirty-three bound nouns referring to external body parts compared to only five link nouns. This indicates that there are semantic differences between subclasses. For example, among the five link nouns is \"ao-\" ‘cheek’ is the only one that refers to external human body parts while others refer to external animal and insect parts (Osumi, 1995, p. 65). This shows that all external human body parts are bound nouns, except for \"ao-\" in Tîrî (Osumi, 1995, p. 65).\n\n"}

It has a number of functions, including seeking out the enemy and securing ground in advance of the main force.\n\nThe vanguard derives from the traditional division of a medieval army into three \"battles\" or \"wards\"; the Van, the Main (or Middle), and the Rear. The term Vanguard originates with the medieval French \"avant-garde\", i.e. \"the advance guard\". The vanguard would lead the line of march and would deploy first on the field of battle, either in front of the other wards or to the right if they stood in line.\n\nThe makeup of the vanguard of a fifteenth-century Burgundian army is a typical example. This consisted of \nIn an English force of the period, the foreriders of the vanguard would be accompanied by the harbingers, whose job was to locate lodgings for the army for the following night.\n\nDuring the Soviet-German War (1941-1945), beginning in July 1943, the Red Army began forming, as part of its offensive doctrine, \"ad hoc\" vanguard formations called forward detachments \"[peredovye otriady]\", from army, corps and divisional units. Forward detachments brought together the mobile (motorized or mechanized) elements of the parent formation to play an exploitation role once a breakthrough of the German lines occurred. A rifle division, for example, might mount one or two battalions of infantry on trucks, with motorized antitank guns and motorized artillery in support.\n\n"}
{"id": "43349892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43349892", "title": "World revolution", "text": "World revolution\n\nWorld revolution is the Marxist concept of overthrowing capitalism in all countries through the conscious revolutionary action of the organized working class. These revolutions would not necessarily occur simultaneously, but where and when local conditions allowed a revolutionary party to successfully replace bourgeois ownership and rule, and install a workers' state based on social ownership of the means of production. In most Marxist schools, such as Trotskyism, the essentially international character of the class struggle and the necessity of global scope are critical elements and a chief explanation of the failure of socialism in one country.\n\nThe end goal of such internationally oriented revolutionary socialism is to achieve world socialism, and later, stateless communism.\n\nThe October Revolution of 1917 in Russia sparked a revolutionary wave of socialist and communist uprisings across Europe, most notably the German Revolution, the Hungarian Revolution, Biennio Rosso and the revolutionary war in Finland with the short lived Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic, which made large gains and met with considerable success in the early stages; see also Revolutions of 1917-23.\n\nParticularly in the years 1918-1919, it seemed plausible that capitalism would soon be swept from the European continent forever. Given the fact that European powers controlled the majority of Earth's land surface at the time, such an event could have meant the end of capitalism not just in Europe, but everywhere. Additionally, the Comintern, founded in March 1919, began as an independent international organization of communists from various countries around the world that evolved after the Russian Civil War into an essentially Soviet-sponsored agency responsible for coordinating the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism worldwide.\nWith the prospect of world revolution so close at hand, Marxists were dominated by a feeling of overwhelming optimism, which in the end proved to be quite premature. The European revolutions were crushed one by one, until eventually the Russian revolutionaries found themselves to be the only survivors. Since they had been relying on the idea that an underdeveloped and agrarian country like Russia would be able to build socialism with help from successful revolutionary governments in the more industrialized parts of Europe, they found themselves in a crisis once it became clear that no such help would arrive; see \"Socialism in one country\".\n\nAfter those events and up until the present day, the international situation never came quite so close to a world revolution again.\nAs fascism grew in Europe in the 1930s, instead of immediate revolution, the Comintern opted for a Popular Front with liberal capitalists against fascism; then, at the height of World War II in 1943, the Comintern was disbanded on the request of the Soviet Union's Western allies.\n\nA new upsurge of revolutionary feeling swept across Europe in the aftermath of World War II, though it was not as strong as the one triggered by World War I which resulted in failed (in the socialist sense) revolution in Germany and a successful one (for seventy years) in Russia. Communist parties in countries such as Greece, France, and Italy had acquired significant prestige and public support due to their activity as leaders of anti-fascist resistance movements during the war; as such, they also enjoyed considerable success at the polls and regularly finished second in elections in the late 1940s. However, none managed to finish in first and form a government. Communist parties in Eastern Europe, meanwhile, though they did win elections at around the same time, Western media criticized the lack of liberal democratic elements in their rise to power. Nonetheless, Communist movements in Eastern Europe proliferated, even with some local cases independent of the USSR, such as the Yugoslav Partisans, who also were integral in repelling fascism during World War II.\n\nRevolts across the world in the 1960s and early 1970s, coupled with the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the establishment of the New Left together with the Civil Rights Movement, the militancy of the Black Panther Party and similar armed/insurrectionary \"Liberation Front\" groups around the globe, and even a bit of a resurgence in the labor movement for a time once again made it seem to some as though world revolution was not only possible, but actually imminent; thus, there was a common expression, \"The East is Red, and the West is Ready\". However, this radical left spirit ebbed by the mid-1970s, and in 1980s and 1990s there was a return to certain right-wing, economically conservative ideologies (spearheaded, among other examples, by Thatcherism in the United Kingdom and Reaganomics in the United States) and also free-market reforms in China and in Vietnam.\n\nWithin Marxist theory, Lenin's concept of the labor aristocracy and his description of imperialism, andseparately, but not necessarily unrelatedlyTrotsky's theories regarding the deformed workers' state, offer several explanations as to why the world revolution has not occurred to the present day. Many groups still explicitly pursue the goal of worldwide communist revolution, calling it the truest expression of proletarian internationalism.\n\n"}

Yanesha' may also have been influenced by Quechua's vowel system so that, today, it has a three-vowel system rather than a four-vowel one that is typical of related Arawakan languages.\n\nYanesha' has 22 consonants and 9 vowel phonemes. The consonants have a certain degree of allophonic variation while that of the vowels is more considerable.\n\n\nYanesha', similar to languages like Russian, Irish, and Marshallese, makes contrasts between certain pairs of palatalized and plain consonants:\n\n\nThe remaining two palatalized consonants, and , don’t offer a one-to-one contrast with plain consonants; the former because it is the only lateral consonant and so contrasts with no other phoneme on the basis of just palatalization; , while contrasting with , also contrasts with , , and . The bilabial palatalized consonants have a more perceptible palatal offglide than the alveolar ones. Word-finally, this offglide is voiceless for and while being absent for .\n\nAnother general feature of Yanesha' is devoicing in certain contexts. In addition to the devoicing of palatal offglides above, the retroflex fricative is voiceless when word final (final devoicing) or before a voiceless consonant (regressive assimilation): \"arrpa\" ('here it is') → . The approximants and are voiceless before voiceless stops, as in \"huautena\" ('barks') and \"neytarr\" ('my door'); is also voiceless before affricates and word-finally: \"ahuey\" ('let's go').\n\nSimilarly, the stops , , and are aspirated word-finally \"ellap\" ('shotgun') → ; preceding another stop or an affricate, a stop may be aspirated or unreleased so that \"etquëll\" ('a fish') is realized as or . The velar fricative is debuccalized to before another consonant.\n\nYanesha' has three basic vowel qualities, , , and . Each contrasts phonemically between short, long, and \"laryngeal\" or glottalized forms.\n\nLaryngealization generally consists of glottalization of the vowel in question, creating a kind of creaky voice. In pre-final contexts, a variation occurs—especially before voiced consonants—ranging from creaky phonation throughout the vowel to a sequence of a vowel, glottal stop, and a slightly rearticulated vowel: \"ma'ñorr\" ('deer') → . Before a word-final nasal, this rearticulated vowel may be realized as a syllabic quality of said nasal. Also, although not as long as a phonemically long vowel, laryngeal vowels are generally longer than short ones. When absolutely word-final, laryngealized vowels differ from short ones only by the presence of a following glottal stop.\n\nEach vowel varies in its phonetic qualities, having contextual allophones as well as phones in free variation with each other:\n\nLaryngeal consists of the same variation and allophony of the short phoneme with the minor exception that it is more likely to be realized as close following as in \"pe'sherr\" ('parakeet') → 'parakeet'\n\nAll consonants appear initially, medially, and finally with the exception that and do not occur word-finally. With two exceptions ( and ), initial clusters include at least one stop. The other possible initial clusters are:\n\nWord final clusters consist of either a nasal or followed by a plosive or affricate: \n\nMedial clusters may be of two or three consonants.\n\nAlthough apparently phonemic, stress tends to occur on the penultimate syllable but also in the ultimate. Less frequently, it is antepenultimate. Some words, like \"oc̈hen\" ('comb'), have stress in free variation.\n"}
