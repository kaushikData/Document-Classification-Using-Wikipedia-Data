The soluble case was solved by Serre in 1990 and the full conjecture was proved in 1994 by work of Michel Raynaud and David Harbater.\n\nThe problem involves a finite group \"G\", a prime number \"p\", and the function field of nonsingular integral algebraic curve \"C\" defined over an algebraically closed field \"K\" of characteristic \"p\".\n\nThe question addresses the existence of Galois extensions \"L\" of \"K\"(\"C\"), with \"G\" as Galois group, and with restricted ramification. From a geometric point of view \"L\" corresponds to another curve \"C\"′, and a morphism\n\nRamification geometrically, and by analogy with the case of Riemann surfaces, consists of a finite set \"S\" of points \"x\" on \"C\", such that π restricted to the complement of \"S\" in \"C\" is an étale morphism. In Abhyankar's conjecture, \"S\" is fixed, and the question is what \"G\" can be. This is therefore a special type of inverse Galois problem.\n\nThe subgroup \"p\"(\"G\") is defined to be the subgroup generated by all the Sylow subgroups of \"G\" for the prime number \"p\". This is a normal subgroup, and the parameter \"n\" is defined as the minimum number of generators of\n\nThen for the case of \"C\" the projective line over \"K\", the conjecture states that \"G\" can be realised as a Galois group of \"L\", unramified outside \"S\" containing \"s\" + 1 points, if and only if\n\nThis was proved by Raynaud.\n\nFor the general case, proved by Harbater, let \"g\" be the genus of \"C\".

An abomination in English is that which is exceptionally loathsome, hateful, sinful, wicked, or vile.\n\nThe Biblical words usually translated as \"abomination\" do not always convey the same sense of moral exceptionalism as the English term does today, as it often may signify that which is forbidden or unclean according to the religion (especially \"sheqets\"). Linguistically in this case, it may be closer in meaning to the Polynesian term taboo or \"tapu\", signifying that which is forbidden, and should not be eaten, and or not touched, and which sometimes was a capital crime. The word most often translated \"abomination\" to denote grave moral offenses is \"Tōʻēḇā.\" This article examines the term as it is used in English translations of the Bible, and also the actual senses of the words which are being translated into this term in English.\n\nThe term \"shiqquts\" is translated \"abomination\" by almost all translations of the Bible. The similar words, \"sheqets\", and \"shâqats\", are almost exclusively used for dietary violations.\n\nThe common but slighty different Hebrew term, \"tōʻēḇā\", is also translated as \"abomination\" in the Authorized King James Version, and sometimes in the NASB. Many modern versions of the Bible (including the NIV and NET) translate it \"detestable\"; the NAB translates it \"loathsome\". It is mainly used to denote idolatry; and in many other cases it refers to inherently evil things such as illicit sex, lying, murder, deceit, etc.; and for unclean foods.\n\nAnother word which can signify that which is abhorred is zâ‛am. There are less used Hebrew words with a similar conveyance, as well as Greek terms for such.\n\n\"Shiqquts\" is used in the following ways:\n\n\n\nThe word \"sheqets\" is used with eating:\nother biblically unclean animals or touching certain things,()\n\n\"Shâqats\" is rendered in the KJV as follows:\n\n\n\"Tōʻēḇā\" is used in the following ways:\n\n\n\"Tōʻēḇā\" is also used in Jewish (and Christian Old Testament) scriptures to refer to:\n\n\n\"Tâ‛ab\" is rendered the following ways in the KJV\n\n\n\n"}

Simha\n\nChannapatna Ramaswami Simha (16 June 1942 – 28 February 2014), better known as C. R. Simha, was an Indian actor, director, dramatist and playwright. He was best known for his work in Kannada films and for his work in stage shows. Starting his career in Prabhat Kalavidaru, a famous theatre group based in Bangalore, he acted in numerous Kannada plays which reached the cult status. He started his own theatre group called \"Nataranga\" in 1972 and directed many successful plays such as \"Kakana Kote\", \"Thughlaq\" and \"Sankranthi\".\n\nSimha also directed and acted in the Kannada adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"Othello\". These plays found a widespread presentation across many states in India. Following this, he directed and acted in many English plays written by eminent personalities such as Moliere, Bernard Shaw, Edward Albee and Neil Simon among others. Apart from theatre, Simha acted in more than 150 feature films in Kannada which include both artistic and commercially viable projects. He also directed about five feature films with the most prominent being his own film adaptation of \"Kakana Kote\".\n\nSimha received many awards in both the cinema and theatre fields. In 2003, he was awarded with the prestigious Sangeet Natak Akademi Award by the Government of India recognising his contribution to theatre acting and direction.\n\nSimha was born in Karnataka on 16 June 1942 into a Hoysala Karnataka Brahmin family. His younger brother Srinath is a famous film actor who acted in several mainstream Kannada cinema as both the leading actor and supporting actor.\n\nSimha appeared on stage at the age of twelve. He wrote a book at the age of thirteen titled \"Family Doctor\" and got a publisher for a remuneration of 15. He was a student of National College at Basavanagudi, Bangalore. In 1959, he joined the National College Histronics Club, an institution nurtured by Dr. H. Narasimhaiah. Simha then acted in many Kannada plays like \"Bahaddur Ganda\" and \"Manavemba Markata\".\n\nSimha, along with his friends, started a theatre group called \"Nataranga\" in 1972. He acted in and directed many successful plays like \"Kakana Kote\" and \"Tughlaq\".\n\nSimha also acted in and directed straight translations of Shakespeare's plays such as \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"Othello\", which besides Karnataka, were also performed in Delhi, Bombay (Mumbai), Madras (Chennai) & Calcutta (Kolkata). In 1960, Simha became a member of \"Bangalore Little Theatre\" (BLT) and since then directed some of the reputed English plays which included his portrayal of Cyrano de Bergerac which was hailed as a memorable performance. His other notable works for BLT were Utpal Dutt's \"Suryashikar\" and Girish Karnad's \"Thuglaq\".\n\nIn 1983, Simha started another theatre group called \"Vedhike\" in which his one-man show \"Typical Kailasam\" became a success. It was the first amateur Kannada play to be performed abroad (in the United States of America, Canada and England). Some of the other notable plays which made news through \"Vedhike\" are \"Meese Bandoru\", \"Bhairavi\", \"Karna\", \"Rasa Rishi Kuvempu\", \"Macbeth\", \"Maduve Maduve\", \"Haavu Yeni\" and \"8/15\". Among these, \"Rasa Rishi Kuvempu\", based on the life and literature of Kuvempu, was made into a film, directed by Simha's son Rithwik Simha, in which Simha plays the role of Kuvempu.\n\nBesides making his strong presence in theatre, Simha was also a popular mainstream character actor in numerous Kannada films. He acted in close to 150 feature films. His portrayal of roles varied from critically acclaimed award-winning films like \"Samskara\", \"Bara\", \"Chithegoo Chinte\" and \"Anuroopa\" and also in commercially acclaimed films such as \"Indina Ramayana\", \"Nee Bareda Kadambari\", \"Parameshi Prema Prasanga\", \"Rayaru Bandaru Mavana Manege\" and \"Nee Thanda Kanike\". Simha played negative roles, against Anant Nag in Ramapurada Ravana (1984) and with Dr. Rajkumar in Parashuram (1990). Simha's villainous role in Parashuram was said to be very menacing.\n\nBesides acting, Simha has directed five films including \"Kakana Kote\" (1977), \"Shikaari\", \"Simhasana\", \"Ashwamedha\" (1990) and \"Angayalli Apsare\" (1993).\n\nSimha made his strong presence in television too and acted in several tele-serials in Kannada, Hindi and English languages. This includes the most famous worldwide serial \"Malgudi Days\". Another noteworthy serial was \"Goruru in America\" based on the travelogue written by the humorist Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar. Simha played the part of Gorur and the serial was shot extensively in America including Newyork, Washington D.C., Niagara Falls, Disneyland and Universal Studios – Hollywood.\n\nSimha wrote and published five plays in Kannada. He was a popular columnist, he wrote a column called \"Nimma Simha\" every Friday for six years in the popular daily newspaper Vijaya Karnataka and three volumes of this are published in the Book forum.\n\nIn February 2014, Simha was admitted to Sevakshetra Hospital, Bangalore having been suffering from prostate cancer from over a year. He died on 28 February 2014. On 1 March, his body was kept at the Samsa Bayalu Rangamandira for people to pay homage and his favourite songs were sung by theatre artists. He was cremated at the Banashankari crematorium in Bangalore the same day. Simha's last public appearance was at the press meet of the film \"Rasarishi Kuvempu\" in which he played the lead role.\n"}

Before the transformation of the ARPANET into the modern Internet, the term \"internet\" in its lower case spelling was a common short form of the term internetwork, and this spelling and use may still be found in discussions of networking.\n\nThe spelling \"internet\" has become commonly used, as the word virtually always refers to the global network; the generic sense of the word has become rare.\n\nIn some of the first printed mentions of the Internet, like many other US government projects of the period, it was referred to in all caps as INTERNET, despite not being an acronym. \n\nThe Internet standards community historically differentiated between \"the\" Internet and \"an\" internet (or internetwork), treating the former as a proper noun with a capital letter, and the latter as a common noun with lower-case first letter. An internet is any internetwork or set of inter-connected Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The distinction is evident in Request for Comments documents from the early 1980s, when the transition from the ARPANET to the Internet was in progress, although it was not applied with complete uniformity.\n\nAnother example from that period is IBM's \"TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview\" () from 1989, which stated that:\nThe words internetwork and internet is simply a contraction of the phrase interconnected network. However, when written with a capital \"I,\" the Internet refers to the worldwide set of interconnected networks. Hence, the Internet is an internet, but the reverse does not apply. The Internet is sometimes called the connected internet.\n\nIn the Request for Comments documents that define the evolving Internet Protocol standards, the term was introduced as a noun adjunct, apparently a shortening of \"internetworking\" and is mostly used in this way.\n\nAs the impetus behind IP grew, it became more common to regard the results of internetworking as entities of their own, and \"internet\" became a noun, used both in a generic sense (any collection of computer networks connected through internetworking) and in a specific sense (the collection of computer networks that internetworked with ARPANET, and later NSFNET, using the IP standards, and that grew into the connectivity service we know today).\n\nIn its generic sense, \"internet\" is a common noun, a synonym for internetwork; therefore, it has a plural form (first appearing in the RFC series RFC 870, RFC 871 and RFC 872) and is not capitalized.\n\nIn a 1991 court case, Judge Jon O. Newman used it as a mass noun: \"Morris released the worm into INTERNET, which is a group of national networks that connect university, governmental, and military computers around the country.\"\n\nIn 2002 a \"New York Times\" column said that \"Internet\" has been changing from a proper noun to a generic term. Words for new technologies, such as \"phonograph\" in the 19th century, are sometimes capitalized at first, later becoming uncapitalized. In 1999 another column said that \"Internet\" might, like some other commonly used proper nouns, lose its capital letter.\n\nCapitalization of the word as an adjective also varies. Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized as a noun but not capitalized as an adjective, e.g., \"internet resources\".\n\nAccording to English capitalization rules, all proper nouns should be capitalized. Because there is only one global \"Internet\", when one speaks about the Internet itself, it should be capitalized.\n\nExamples of media publications and news outlets that capitalize the term include \"Time\", the United States Government Printing Office, and \"The Times of India\". In addition, many peer-reviewed journals and professional publications such as \"Communications of the ACM\" capitalize \"Internet\", and this style guideline is also specified by the American Psychological Association in its electronic media spelling guide. The Modern Language Association's \"MLA Handbook\" does not specifically mention capitalization of Internet, but its consistent practice is to capitalize it.\n\nA significant number of publications do not capitalize \"internet\". Among them are \"The Economist\", the \"Financial Times\", \"The Times\" of London, \"The Guardian\", \"The Observer\", the BBC, and \"The Sydney Morning Herald\". As of 2011, most publications using \"internet\" appear to be located outside North America, but the gap is closing. \"Wired News\", an American news source, adopted the lower-case spelling in 2004. Media companies like BuzzFeed and Vox Media avoid capitalizing the \"internet\" similarly. Around April 2010, CNN shifted its house style to adopt the lowercase spelling. The Associated Press announced that the 2016 \"AP Stylebook\" will no longer capitalize \"internet\". \"The New York Times\" announced their decision in May 2016 to decapitalize all instances of \"internet\" for reasons similar to AP's. As Internet connectivity has expanded, it has started to be seen as a service similar to television, radio, and telephone, and the word has come to be used in this way (e.g. \"I have the internet at home\" and \"I found it on the internet\").\n\nAccording to Oxford Dictionaries Online, as of April 2016 the spelling \"Internet\" remains more usual in the US, while \"internet\" has become predominant in the UK.\n\n"}

{"id": "56778565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56778565", "title": "Dalmacio Iglesias García", "text": "Dalmacio Iglesias García\n\nJesús María José Dalmacio Iglesias García (1879-1933) was a Spanish Carlist politician, active almost exclusively in Catalonia. His career climaxed during one term in the Congress of Deputies (1910-1914) and one term in the Senate (1918-1919). He did not manage to build his personal following; in historiography he is considered a rather unique case of a right-wing revolutionary who strove to launch a Christian, violent, urban, working class, anti-establishment movement. The bid has ultimately failed and in the 1920s Iglesias withdrew from active politics.\n\nThe ancestors of Dalmacio Iglesias were related to Galicia. His paternal family originated from Orense; his grandfather, Victorio Iglesias Fernández, served as oficial primero of Tesorería de Hacienda in the city. He married Vicenta Pardo and the couple had at least two sons; both of them studied medicine. The younger one, Luis Iglesias Pardo, served as physician in the Spanish navy; he gained some recognition in the maritime and local Galician realm as author of scientific works on medicine, sanitation and hygiene in the navy, all published in the 1870s and 1880s. The older brother, Antonio Iglesias Pardo (1844-1902), opted for a civilian career; in the 1870s he served in Cáceres, but in 1885 he left Extremadura and returned to his native Orense. Until the mid-1890s he worked as surgeon in the city and in some neighboring locations, including these already in the Salamanca province. In 1898 he commenced practice in the Santiago de Compostela hospital, where he served until his premature death.\n\nAt unspecified time though probably prior to mid-1870s Antonio Iglesias married María Asunción García Legond, a native of Santiago and member to another family related to military medical services. It is not clear how many children the couple had. Dalmacio was born during the Cáceres spell of his father, where he probably spent his childhood years. In the mid-1880s he moved with his parents to Orense, living at calle Cervantes 15. It is there where in the local Insituto – the secular secondary school – he was rewarded with high grades upon his bachillerato. At unspecified time yet most likely in the late 1890s he enrolled at the faculty of law at Universidad de Santiago, where his career was punctuated by a brief period of military service. As a university student he performed brilliantly; Iglesias obtained governmental prize in course of the curriculum, was rewarded for his study on legal rights of married woman and got premio etraordinario when graduated in 1902.\n\nUpon passing entry exams in early 1903 Iglesias was admitted to and moved to Madrid, soon to be placed as the ministry delegate in Barcelona. In ciudad condal in 1907 he married Mercedes Janer Milá de la Roca (died 1963), daughter to a Catalan Carlist leader and wealthy entrepreneur . Dalmacio and Mercedes settled in the Catalan capital. None of their descendants became a publicly recognized figure. They had one child, María de las Mercedes, who married a navy officer Federico Caso Montaner. Dalmacio Iglesias did not live to see his only grandson, Alberto Caso Iglesias, who would later become a physician. Dalmacio's sister-in-law María gained name as a Carlist propagandist and activist, while his brother-in-law became a locally known writer. Cousins of his wife and turned recognized Catalan artists, respectively a painter and a writer. It is not clear whether a well-known singer Julio Iglesias, who also originated from Orense, was his distant relative.\n\nThe young Dalmacio has early developed a penchant for letters and already in 1893 he contributed to local periodicals. During his academic period he kept publishing and founded an ephemeral literary weekly \"Santiago\". He practiced his oratory skills in Ateneo Escolar Compostelano, where he became first the secretary and then the president, and in Ateneo Leon XIII. Inclined towards literature, he used to read out his own poetry and wrote prosaic pieces in Gallego, his works were flavored with militant religious zeal. In 1902 he took part in the Catholic Congress in Santiago and presented a paper at a section dedicated to religious orders. It was during the academic period when Iglesias was fascinated by the personality of Juan Vázquez de Mella and got attracted to Carlism.\n\nIt seems that upon arrival in Catalonia Iglesias engaged in Carlist youth structures; in 1904 he was noted as giving lectures in Círculo Tradicionalista of Barcelona and in late 1905 he became vice-president of Juventud Tradicionalista in the city, delivering addresses also elsewhere in Catalonia, e.g. in Gerona. At the time the Catalan Carlists were more than ever prepared to swallow their skepticism about alliance with other anti-governmental parties, especially the regionalists from La Lliga; the strategy produced a broad electoral alliance known as Solidaridad Catalana. Iglesias spoke vehemently against this \"hermandad vulgo pisto rabioso pactada\"; his highly emotional harangues earned him attention of the Liberal and Republican press, as already in early 1906 he featured as a negative point of reference.\n\nApart from his duties as a Ministry of Finance delegate Iglesias practiced also as a lawyer. In 1908 he got involved in a controversial and widely discussed case known as \"caso Rull\". Rull was an undercover police operative who penetrated the world of Barcelona proletarian conspiracy but was himself charged with terrorism, perhaps related to some extreme party or organization. Iglesias first represented some of the defendants in court and later defended Rull himself in an appeal case. The two seemed to have developed sort of friendship yet the prosecutor had his way and Rull was eventually executed; during and after the affair Iglesias was widely quoted speaking on terrorism and related issues. The Rull affair gained Iglesias a name in Barcelona, since in 1909 he emerged as expert on \"antrolopología criminal\".\n\nOnce the city was rocked by riots known as Semana Trágica Iglesias voiced against \"doctrinas positivistas\" and secular teaching, identified as primary roots of urban unrest. In 1909 and in response to left-wing violence Iglesias engaged in Catholic social action and was among the founders of Carlism-related Comité de Defensa Social, an hybrid organisation with characteristics of a cultural centre, a mutual help organization, a militia and a trade union. As a joint CdDS and Carlist representative supported by other right-wing groupings he ran in the Cortes elections from Gerona in 1910; riding the wave of anti-Left backlash which followed The Tragic Week he somewhat unexpectedly emerged triumphant.\n\nThe 1910-1914 Cortes service proved the period of Iglesias' hectic if not frenetic activity, especially during the first two years of his tenure. Though he focused also on topics like the army and economy he was mostly bent on confronting the Radicals of Lerroux, whom he presented as a threat not only to public order but also to the entire civilization. His own rhetoric was inflammatory; Canalejas noted that in his counter-revolutionary zeal he was carried away by hysteria. Though member of the diet, Iglesias emerged as leader of right-wing Catalan obrerismo, a working class violent anti-establishment movement. Confronting both radical lerrouxistas and bourgeoisie La Lliga, Iglesias started to champion what looked like a nascent Christian, urban, aggressive, proletariant protest crusade. His zeal to do away with the regime would soon lead him to advancing theories of Carlists and republicans joining ranks to topple the Restoration system, quickly quashed by the party hierarchy and rejected by the Republicans.\n\nIglesias's name soon became tantamount to an explosive conflict. Due to violent language employed and logic which instigated rebellion his press articles gave rise to many official enquiries. In the early 1910s he managed himself two weeklies: \"La Voz de la Tradición\" and \"La Trinchera\"; especially the latter emerged as the chief platform of violent obrerista propaganda which indulged in \"fantasies of civil war in which Carlism triumphed\". Police prevented sale of his discourses and he was among the most investigated MPs, by far surpassing the first ever socialist MP in the Spanish parliament, Pablo Iglesias.\n\nAlmost every second rally Iglesias attended ended up in riots, usually between the Carlist requetés and the Radical Jovenes Barbaros. Even his expected attendance might have led to violent clashes, e.g. with two dead left in Eibar. He was a few times assaulted. However, the most deadly turned out to be a ; following his address at a Carlist rally hundreds of requetés and lerrouxistas engaged in a melee which left 6 people killed, the incident investigated later in the parliament. It is with his personal contribution that \"from 1911 to 1916 scuffling and occasional shoot-outs between Carlist and Radical youth were an accepted part of the Barcelona scene\", especially that in 1913 he hailed \"the club and the browning, the two indispensable companions of Jaimist youth\".\n\nIglesias' radicalism estranged the Catalan Carlist leadership and the regional party jefe Duque de Solferino a few times tried to mitigate him; despite being Gerona MP Iglesias did not head the provincial Gerona organisation. Iglesias himself started to dream of old-fashioned party leaders killed in a civil war and making room for the youth. However, in 1912 he entered the national Carlist executive and also in 1912 in Biarritz he met his king for the first time. He did not seem engaged in struggle for power within the party top echelons and is not listed as protagonist of a raging conflict between his old-time master Vázquez de Mella and the official party leader, .\n\nIn the 1914 electoral campaign Iglesias stood as a Carlist candidate in Gerona and though proportionally he was more successful than 4 years earlier, ultimately he failed to renew his deputy ticket. It would soon turn out that he failed in his later bids – also from Gerona - of 1916 and 1918. Iglesias acknowledged defeat, resumed his suspended duties as Hacienda delegate and re-opened the law office in Barcelona.\n\nAlways skeptical about courting La Lliga, in the mid-1910s Iglesias started to lead an anti-Catalanist group within the local party. Though he declared himself a regionalist and even in favor of autonomy, by scholars he is considered a champion of anti-regionalist españolismo; opponent of the new Catalan Carlist leader and his daily \"El Correo Catalan\", Iglesias openly challenged his line of seeking understanding with the Catalanists. The rift became clear when in 1915 he founded \"El Legitimista Catalan\"; the national party jefe Cerralbo disauthorised the paper and threatened these taking part in a related meeting with expulsion; the meeting took place and invariably ended in riots, but the weekly was eventually closed after just 3 months. Iglesias found himself on the verge of loyalty to the party, yet Cerralbo preferred not to escalate the conflict; in 1916 he confirmed Iglesias as the party candidate from Gerona, which in turn triggered protest resignation of the local Carlist Junta Provincial. Iglesias kept lambasting a policy which according to him melted Carlism in a broad Catalanism; upon the 1917 emergence of he strongly voiced against the initiative as giving in to the likes of Lerroux and Cambó.\n\nThere were two other threads which rendered Iglesias a key protagonist of internal conflict in regional Carlism. One was his continued penchant for social radicalism; he remained active in Comité de Defensa Social and even built its militia, apart from reverting to a theory that the Carlists should close ranks with \"extrema izquierda\" in order to do away with the corrupted regime. Another conflictive issue was the Great War. While the party officially supported neutrality most Catalan Carlists harbored francophone feelings; Iglesias emerged as leader of the local pro-German faction, noted for his cries of \"viva Alemania\" and even for declaration that he was prepared to shed blood if the time comes.\n\nIt remains paradoxical that despite his extremely conflictive personality Iglesias remained on at least formally correct terms with other party leaders; in 1917 together with Junyent he entered Comité de Acción Política of the Catalan Carlism, a new body of somewhat unclear role. It seems even more surprising that following defeat in 1918 elections Iglesias managed to ensure support of conservative parties when competing for seat in the Senate from Tarragona; it seems that he owed success to Maura and his ruling faction rather than to his own party. During a short term between mid-1918 and mid-1919 he basked in prestige of a senator and contributed to a few legal solutions adopted, e.g. to the law on civil servants.\n\nConflict between the key party theorist Vázquez de Mella and the claimant Don Jaime, the strife which was tearing Carlism apart since the late 1900s, came to an abrupt end in early 1919: the Mellistas broke away to build their own party. Iglesias has always remained fascinated with de Mella yet he did not count among his partisans in course of internal conflict; it was only during the Great War that he emerged as key Catalan Mellista. In February 1919 he was expulsed from Comunión Tradicionalista and immediately engaged in work to built a new Mellista organization. After , leader of the Catalan secessionists, Iglesias was the most prominent exponent of the breakaways in the region and some count him among the most prominent secessionists also nationwide; some authors name him a leader of \"dalmacistas\", one of a few mostly personalist factions allegedly making up the Mellista group.\n\nUpon expiration of the senator mandate in May 1919 Iglesias for the 5th time tried to obtain the deputy ticket from Gerona and for the 4th time failed; initially reported to run for a consolation prize in the senate from Tarragona he eventually withdrew. He contributed to local efforts of forging a new party within a grand right-wing coalition and specified his program as \"religión, unidad de la Patria española, Orden social y Monarquía tradicional y, por tanto, regionalista\"; indeed he supported the autonomous statute drafted by Mancomunitat. During a grand assembly of Catalan Mellistas in Badalona of 1920 he hoped they would serve as agglutinatory factor for all Catholic forces, yet such a union was slow to materialize: in 1921 he was denied the Maurista support during one more bid for the senate. As usual his appearances led to unrest, though in 1921 his rally was interrupted by his former darlings requetés, who shouted \"viva Jaime Tercero\".\n\nIn mid-1922 Iglesias was still reported as heart and soul of the new emerging Mellista party and seemed prepared to go to great lengths when seeking allies, most likely the Integrists; he admitted that having broken all ties with Don Jaime, he was prepared to recognize Don Alfonso as a legitimate king given he swears allegiance to the Traditionalist principles. However, at some point he apparently lost any hope about the Mellista project. Tempted by of Salvador Minguijón and other breakaway Carlists, he considered it a would-be embodiment of \"sumarse al partido católico\" plan. Eventually he neared an initiative to launch a non-dynastical monarchist party, though still remained cautious that the Traditionalists should not lose their own identity. In late 1922 Iglesias was missing among participants of overdue Mellista party launch in Zaragoza and joined Unión Monárquica Nacional instead. In 1923 he was once again rumored to run – as independent – for deputy ticket from Gerona. His political bewilderment was eventually terminated by the Primo de Rivera coup and ban on all party activity.\n\nIglesias had no doubt about adhering to the new regime. Already in late 1923 he took part in homage feasts celebrating Primo as savior of the fatherland; explicitly exalting \"golpe de estado\" he offered his services to the military directorio. During a 1924 rally of Juventud de Acción Tradicionalista he hailed the coup as doing away with the old regime and as a deed spirited by traditionalist principles.\n\nExact scale of Iglesias' engagement in the primoderiverista regime is not clear. He later claimed that during personal meetings with the dictator he had tried to impose upon Primo his own social concerns and that he had repeatedly suggested that the regime should lower the cost of life for the middle- and working class. Press information confirms only his meetings with the Catalan , yet their purpose was not revealed. Active in Union Patriotica, in the late 1920s he seemed less enthusiastic about the dictatorial regime and criticized the constitution draft as the one which reproduced most defects of the 1876 document; in his 1930 pamphlet, \"Política de la dictadura\", Iglesias charged Primo with giving in to capitalist pressure and abandoning the cause of the working people; another pamphlet read like an offer to a centre-left political party.\n\nIn private Iglesias was confirmed at his job of Ministry of Finance delegate to Catalonia; his career was not ruined even by a fistfight with another official over his allegedly unsubstantiated absence in the office, perhaps the last manifestation of Iglesias' notorious inflammatory personality. In mid-1920s he competed for position of Jefe de la sección de Hacienda and in 1927 he was promoted to Jefé Superior de Administración Civil in Catalonia. At that time he emerged as expert on canon law and author of a few related works, which probably earned him Cruz de Oro of Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice order, awarded by the pope. Indeed, in the late 1920s he was noted in public mostly as engaged in numerous religious activities. As expert in juridical science he edited a number of entries in \"Enciclopedia Espasa\", including the one on himself. Last but not least, he was not missing during the 1928 funeral of his old-time master Vázquez de Mella and the acts related. \n\nThere is scarce information on Iglesias' public activity during the last few years of his life. Until death he remained employed as the Catalan delegado de Hacienda. In June 1931 he was rumored to run on a joint right-wing ticket for the Cortes and indeed later that year he was once noted as speaking at a Traditionalism-flavored rally, yet unlike many former Mellistas, Iglesias has not been reported as engaged in a re-united Carlist organization, . Since the early 1920s he was plagued by health problems, yet their nature is not clear and it is not known what caused his premature death. Many periodicals noted his passing away, including at least one Carlist paper.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54993244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54993244", "title": "Environmental personhood", "text": "Environmental personhood\n\nEnvironmental personhood is a legal concept which designates certain environmental entities the status of a legal person. This assigns to these entities, the rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities and legal liability of a legal personality. Environmental personhood emerged from the evolution of legal focus in pursuit of the protection of nature. Over time, focus has evolved from human interests in exploiting nature, to protecting nature for future human generations, to conceptions that allow for nature to be protected as intrinsically valuable. This concept can be used as a vehicle for recognising Indigenous peoples' relationships to natural entities, such as rivers. Environmental personhood, which assigns nature (or aspects of it) certain rights, concurrently provides a means to individuals or groups such as Indigenous peoples to fulfill their human rights.\n\nThe United States Professor Christopher D. Stone first discussed the idea of attributing legal personality to natural objects in the 1970s, in his article \"Should trees have standing? Towards legal rights for natural objects\". A legal person cannot be owned; therefore, no ownership can be attributed to an environmental entity with established legal personality. Standing (law) is directly related to legal personality. Entities with standing, or locus standi, have the right or capacity to bring action or appear in court. Environmental entities cannot themselves bring action or appear in court. However, this action or standing can be achieved on behalf of the entity by a representing legal guardian. Representation could increase protection of culturally significant aspects of the natural environment, or areas vulnerable to exploitation and pollution.\n\nIn 2014, Te Urewera National Park was declared \"Te Urewera\", an environmental legal entity. The area encompassed by \"Te Urewera\" ceased to be a government-owned national park and was transformed into freehold, inalienable land owned by itself.\n\nFollowing the same trend, New Zealand’s Whanganui River was declared to be a legal person in 2017. This new legal entity was named \"Te Awa Tupua\" and is now recognised as “an indivisible and living whole from the mountains to the sea, incorporating the Whanganui River and all of its physical and metaphysical elements.” The river would be represented by two guardians, one from the Whanganui iwi and the other from the Crown.\n\nThe Ganges and Yamuna Rivers are now considered legal persons in an effort to combat pollution. The rivers are sacred to Hindu culture for their healing powers and attraction of pilgrims who bathe and scatter the ashes of their dead. The rivers have been heavily polluted by 1.5 billion litres of untreated sewage and 500 million litres of industrial waste entering the rivers daily.\nThe High Court in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand ordered in March 2017 that the Ganges and its main tributary, the Yamuna, be assigned the status of legal entities. The rivers would gain “all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person.” This decision meant that polluting or damaging the rivers is equivalent to harming a person. The court cited the example of the New Zealand Whanganui River, which was also declared to possess full rights of a legal person.\n\nThis development of environmental personhood has been met with scepticism as merely announcing that the Ganges and Yamuna are living entities will not save them from significant, ongoing pollution. There is a possible need to change long-held cultural attitudes towards the Ganges, which hold that the river has self-purifying properties.\n\nThere is further criticism that the guardianship of the rivers was only granted to Uttarakhand, a region in northern India which houses a small part of the rivers’ full extent. The Ganges flows for 2,525km through Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, with only a 96km stretch running through Uttarakhand. Only a small section of the 1,376km Yamuna tributary runs through Uttarakhand – which also crosses through the states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nRegardless of scepticism surrounding the decision of the Uttarakhand High Court, proclaiming these vulnerable rivers as legal entities invokes a movement of change towards environmental and cultural rights protection. The decisions may be built upon as a foundation for future environmental legislative change. \n\nIn 2006, a small community in Pennsylvania called Tamaqua Borough worked with a rights of nature group called Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund. Together, the groups drafted legislation to protect the community and its environment from the dumping of toxic sewage. Since 2006, CELDF has assisted with over 30 communities in ten states across the United States to develop local laws codifying the rights of nature. CELDF also assisted in the drafting of Ecuador's 2008 constitution following a national referendum.\n\nThe rights of nature “to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles” have been proclaimed under Ecuador’s 2008 constitution. This occurred after a national referendum in 2008, allowing the Ecuador constitution to reflect rights for nature, a world first. Every person and community has the right to advocate on nature's behalf. The Constitution proclaims that the “State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an ecosystem.”\n\nThe first successful case of the rights of nature implementation under Ecuador constitutional law was presented before the Provincial Court of Justice of Loja in 2011. This case involved the Vilcabamba River as the plaintiff, representing itself with its own rights to ‘exist’ and ‘maintain itself’ – as it attempted to halt construction of a government highway project interfering with the natural health of the river.This case was brought before court by two individuals, Richard Frederick Wheeler and Eleanor Geer Huddle, as legal guardians acting in favour of nature – specifically the Vilcabamba River. A constitutional injunction was granted in favour of the Vilcabamba River and against the Provincial government of Loja, attempting to conduct the environmentally-harmful project. The project was forced to be halted and the area was to be rehabilitated.\n\nThe constitutional change in Ecuador was followed legislatively by Bolivia in 2010, passing the ‘Law of the Rights of Mother Earth’ (\"Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra\"). This legislation designates Mother Earth the character of ‘a collective subject of public interest’ with inherent rights specified in the law. The Law of the Rights of Mother Earth give aspects of legal personhood to the natural environment. Judicial action can be taken for infringements against individuals and groups as part of Mother Earth as ‘a collective subject of public interest’. The legislation states that “Mother Earth is the dynamic living system made up of the indivisible community of all living systems, living, interrelated, interdependent and complementary, sharing a common destiny.” \n\nThe Colombia Constitutional Court found in November 2016 that the Atrato River basin possesses rights to \"protection, conservation, maintenance, and restoration.\" This ruling came about as a result of degradation to the river basin from mining, impacting nature and harming of Indigenous peoples and their culture. The court referred to the New Zealand declaration of the Whanganui River as a legal person holding environmental personhood. The court ordered that joint guardianship would be undertaken in the representation of the Atrato River basin. Similarly to the New Zealand declaration, the representatives would come from the national government and the Indigenous people living in the basin.\n\nThe court stated:\n\nThe recognition of the Whanganui River as a legal entity in New Zealand (\"Te Awa Tupua\") encompassed a vivid sense of cultural “inalienable connection” to the local iwi and hapu of the river. Maori culture considers natural features such as the Whanganui River as ancestors and iwi hold deep connections with them as living entities. This inalienable connection of indigenous culture to their natural surroundings is apparent in other parts of the world such as Colombia where a similar environmental personhood declaration was made for the Atrato River basin.\n\nThe lead negotiator for the Whanganui iwi, Gerrard Albert, said “we consider the river an ancestor and always have…treating the river as a living entity is the correct way to approach it, as an indivisible whole, instead of the traditional model for the last 100 years of treating it from a perspective of ownership and management.” James D K Morris and Jacinta Ruru suggest that giving “legal personality to rivers is one way in which the law could develop to provide a lasting commitment to reconciling with Maori.” This was the longest-running legal dispute in New Zealand. The Whanganui iwi had been fighting to assert their rights in harmony with the river since the 1870s.\n\nThis is a fundamental step forward for cultural rights as the environmental personhood status of the river means that if there was harm committed to the river, the law now sees no differentiation between harming the Whanganui iwi or harming the river as they are the same indivisible entity. The Whanganui iwi have a proverb which reads \"Ko au te Awa, ko te Awa ko au\": I am the River and the River is me - the iwi and hapu of the Whanganui River have an inalienable connection with, and responsibility to, \"Te Awa Tupua\" and its health and well-being.\n\n\n"}

More precisely, one fixes a category of manifolds: topological (Top), piecewise linear (PL), or differentiable (Diff). Then the statement is\n\nThe name derives from the Poincaré conjecture, which was made for (topological or PL) manifolds of dimension 3, where being a homotopy sphere is equivalent to being simply connected and closed. The Generalized Poincaré conjecture is known to be true or false in a number of instances, due to the work of many distinguished topologists, including the Fields medal recipients John Milnor, Steve Smale, Michael Freedman and Grigori Perelman.\n\nHere is a summary of the status of the Generalized Poincaré conjecture in various settings.\n\n\nA fundamental fact of differential topology is that the notion of isomorphism in Top, PL, and Diff is the same in dimension 3 and below; in dimension 4, PL and Diff agree, but Top differs. In dimension above 6 they all differ. In dimensions 5 and 6 every PL manifold admits an infinitely differentiable structure that is so-called \"Whitehead compatible\".\n\nThe case \"n\" = 1 and 2 has long been known, by classification of manifolds in those dimensions.\n\nFor a \"PL\" or \"smooth\" homotopy n-sphere, in 1960 Stephen Smale proved for \"n\" ≥ 7 that it was homeomorphic to the \"n\"-sphere and subsequently extended his proof to \"n\" ≥ 5; he received a Fields Medal for his work in 1966. Shortly after Smale's announcement of a proof, John Stallings gave a different proof for dimensions at least 7 that a PL homotopy \"n\"-sphere was homeomorphic to the \"n\"-sphere using the notion of \"engulfing\". E. C. Zeeman modified Stalling's construction to work in dimensions 5 and 6. In 1962, Smale proved a PL homotopy \"n\"-sphere was PL-isomorphic to the standard PL \"n\"-sphere for \"n\" at least 5. In 1966, M.H.A. Newman extended PL engulfing to the topological situation and proved that for \"n ≥ 5\" a \"topological\" homotopy \"n\"-sphere is homeomorphic to the \"n\"-sphere.\n\nMichael Freedman solved the case \"n\" = 4 (in TOP) in 1982 and received a Fields Medal in 1986.\n\nGrigori Perelman solved case \"n\" = 3 (where TOP, PL, and DIFF all coincide) in 2003 in a sequence of three papers. He was offered a Fields Medal in August 2006 and the Millennium Prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute in March 2010, but declined both.\n\nThe Generalized Poincaré conjecture is true topologically, but false smoothly in some dimensions. This results in constructions of manifolds that are homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to the standard sphere, which are known as the exotic spheres: you can interpret these as non-standard smooth structures on the standard (topological) sphere.\n\nThus the homotopy spheres that John Milnor produced are homeomorphic (Top-isomorphic, and indeed piecewise linear homeomorphic) to the standard sphere formula_1, but are not diffeomorphic (Diff-isomorphic) to it, and thus are exotic spheres: they can be interpreted as non-standard differentiable structures on the standard sphere.\n\nMichel Kervaire and Milnor showed that the oriented 7-sphere has 28 different smooth structures (or 15 ignoring orientations), and in higher dimensions there are usually many different smooth structures on a sphere. It is suspected that certain differentiable structures on the 4-sphere, called Gluck twists, are not isomorphic to the standard one, but at the moment there are no known invariants capable of distinguishing different smooth structures on a 4-sphere.\n\nFor piecewise linear manifolds, the Poincaré conjecture is true except possibly in dimension 4, where the answer is unknown, and equivalent to the smooth case.\nIn other words, every compact PL manifold of dimension not equal to 4 that is homotopy equivalent to a sphere is PL isomorphic to a sphere.\n"}
{"id": "129332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=129332", "title": "Grid plan", "text": "Grid plan\n\nThe grid plan, grid street plan, or gridiron plan is a type of city plan in which streets run at right angles to each other, forming a grid. The infrastructure cost for regular grid patterns is generally higher than for patterns with discontinuous streets.\n\nCosts for streets depend largely on four variables: street width, street length, block width and pavement width. Two inherent characteristics of the grid plan, frequent intersections and orthogonal geometry, facilitate pedestrian movement. The geometry helps with orientation and wayfinding and its frequent intersections with the choice and directness of route to desired destinations.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the grid plan method of land measurement was called centuriation. The grid plan dates from antiquity and originated in multiple cultures; some of the earliest planned cities were built using grid plans.\n\nBy 2600 BC, Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization (in what is now Pakistan), were built with blocks divided by a grid of straight streets, running north-south and east-west. Each block was subdivided by small lanes. The cities and monasteries of Gandhara (e.g. Sirkap and Taxila), dating from the 1st millennium BC to the 11th century AD, also had grid-based designs. Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan since 1959, was also founded on the grid-plan of the nearby ruined city of Sirkap.\n\nA workers' village (2570-2500 BC) at Giza, Egypt, housed a rotating labor force and was laid out in blocks of long galleries separated by streets in a formal grid. Many pyramid-cult cities used a common orientation: a north-south axis from the royal palace and an east-west axis from the temple, meeting at a central plaza where King and God merged and crossed.\n\nHammurabi king of the Babylonian Empire in the 17th century BC, ordered the rebuilding of Babylon: constructing and restoring temples, city walls, public buildings, and irrigation canals. The streets of Babylon were wide and straight, intersected approximately at right angles, and were paved with bricks and bitumen.\n\nThe tradition of grid plans is continuous in China from the 15th century BC onward in the traditional urban planning of various ancient Chinese states. Guidelines put into written form in the Kaogongji during the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BC) stated: \"a capital city should be square on plan. Three gates on each side of the perimeter lead into the nine main streets that crisscross the city and define its grid-pattern. And for its layout the city should have the Royal Court situated in the south, the Marketplace in the north, the Imperial Ancestral Temple in the east and the Altar to the Gods of Land and Grain in the west.\"\n\nTeotihuacan, near modern-day Mexico City, is the largest ancient grid-plan site in the Americas. The city's grid covered 21 square kilometres(8 square miles).\n\nPerhaps the most well-known grid system is that spread through the colonies of the Roman Empire. The archetypal Roman Grid was introduced to Italy first by the Greeks, with such information transferred by way of trade and conquest.\n\nAlthough the idea of the grid was present in Hellenic societal and city planning, it was not pervasive prior to the 5th century BC. However, it slowly gained primacy through the work of Hippodamus of Miletus, who planned and replanned many Greek cities in accordance with this form. The concept of a grid as the ideal method of town planning had become widely accepted by the time of Alexander the Great. His conquests were a step in the propagation of the grid plan throughout colonies, some as far-flung as Taxila in Pakistan, that would later be mirrored by the expansion of the Roman Empire. The Greek grid had its streets aligned roughly in relation to the cardinal points and generally looked to take advantage of visual cues based on the hilly landscape typical of Greece and Asia Minor. This was probably best exemplified in Priene, in present-day western Turkey, where the orthogonal city grid was based on the cardinal points, on sloping terrain that struck views out towards a river and the city of Miletus.\n\nThe Etruscan people, whose territories in Italy encompassed what would eventually become Rome, founded what is now the city of Marzabotto at the end of the 6th century BC. Its layout was based on Greek Ionic ideas, and it was here that the main east-west and north-south axes of a town (the \"decumanus maximus\" and \"cardo maximus\" respectively) could first be seen in Italy. According to Stanislawski (1946), the Romans did use grids until the time of the late Republic or early Empire, when they introduced \"centuriation\", a system which they spread around the Mediterranean and into northern Europe later on.\nThe military expansion of this period facilitated the adoption of the grid form as standard: the Romans established \"castra\" (forts or camps) first as military centres; some of them developed into administrative hubs. The Roman grid was similar in form to the Greek version of a grid, but allowed for practical considerations. For example, Roman \"castra\" were often sited on flat land, especially close to or on important nodes like river crossings or intersections of trade routes. The dimensions of the \"castra\" were often standard, with each of its four walls generally having a length of . Familiarity was the aim of such standardisation: soldiers could be stationed anywhere around the Empire, and orientation would be easy within established towns if they had a standard layout. Each would have the aforementioned \"decumanus maximus\" and \"cardo maximus\" at its heart, and their intersection would form the forum, around which would be sited important public buildings. Indeed, such was the degree of similarity between towns that Higgins states that soldiers \"would be housed at the same address as they moved from \"castra\" to \"castra\"\". Pompeii has been cited by both Higgins and Laurence as the best preserved example of the Roman grid.\n\nOutside of the castra, large tracts of land were also divided in accordance with the grid within the walls. These were typically per side (called \"centuria\"), and contained 100 parcels of land (each called \"heredium\"). The \"decumanus maximus\" and \"cardo maximus\" extended from the town gates out towards neighbouring settlements. These were lined up to be as straight as possible, only deviating from their path due to natural obstacles that prevented a direct route.\n\nWhile the imposition of only one town form regardless of region could be seen as an imposition of imperial authority, there is no doubting the practical reasoning behind the formation of the Roman grid. Under Roman guidance, the grid was designed for efficiency and interchangeability, both facilitated by and aiding the expansion of their empire.\n\nAs Japan and the Korean peninsula became politically centralized in the 7th century AD, those societies adopted Chinese grid-planning principles in numerous locations. In Korea, Gyeongju, the capital of Unified Silla, and Sanggyeong, the capital of Balhae, adapted the Tang Dynasty Chinese model. The ancient capitals of Japan, such as Fujiwara-Kyô (AD 694-710), Nara (Heijô-Kyô, AD 710-784), and Kyoto (Heian-Kyô, AD 794-1868) also adapted from Tang's capital, Chang'an. However, for reasons of defense, the planners of Tokyo eschewed the grid, opting instead for an irregular network of streets surrounding the Edo Castle grounds. In later periods, some parts of Tokyo were grid-planned, but grid plans are generally rare in Japan, and the Japanese addressing system is accordingly based on increasingly fine subdivisions, rather than a grid.\n\nThe grid-planning tradition in Asia continued through the beginning of the 20th century, with Sapporo, Japan (est. 1868) following a grid plan under American influence.\n\nNew European towns were planned using grids beginning in the 12th century, most prodigiously in the bastides of southern France that were built during the 13th and 14th centuries. Medieval European new towns using grid plans were widespread, ranging from Wales to the Florentine region. Many were built on ancient grids originally established as Roman colonial outposts. In the British Isles, the planned new town system involving a grid street layout was part of the system of burgage.\n\nThe Roman model was also used in Spanish settlements during the Reconquista of Ferdinand and Isabella. It was subsequently applied in the new cities established during the Spanish colonization of the Americas, after the founding of San Cristóbal de La Laguna (Canary Islands) in 1496. In 1573, King Phillip II of Spain compiled the Laws of the Indies to guide the construction and administration of colonial communities. The Laws specified a square or rectangular central plaza with eight principal streets running from the plaza's corners. Hundreds of grid-plan communities throughout the Americas were established according to this pattern, echoing the practices of earlier Indian civilizations.\n\nThe baroque capital city of Malta, Valletta, dating back to the 16th Century, was built following a rigid grid plan of uniformly designed houses, dotted with palaces, churches and squares.\n\nThe grid plan became popular with the start of the Renaissance in Northern Europe. In 1606, the newly founded city of Mannheim in Germany was the first Renaissance city laid out on the grid plan. Later came the New Town in Edinburgh and almost the entire city centre of Glasgow, and many planned communities and cities in Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nDerry, constructed in 1613–1618, was the first planned city in Ireland. The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was considered a good design for defence. The grid pattern was widely copied in the colonies of British North America.\n\nIn Russia the first planned city was St. Petersburg founded in 1703 by Peter I. Being aware of the modern European construction experience which he examined in the years of his Grand Embassy to Europe, czar ordered Domenico Trezzini to elaborate the first general plan of the city. The project of this architect for Vasilyevsky Island was a typical rectangular grid of streets (originally intended to be canals, like in Amsterdam), with three lengthwise thoroughfares, rectangularly crossed with about 30 crosswise streets.\n\nThe shape of street blocks on Vasilyevsky Island is the same, as was later implemented in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 for Manhattan: elongated rectangles. The longest side of each block faces the relatively narrow street with a numeric name (in Petersburg they are called \"Liniya\" (Line)) while the shortest side faces wide avenues. To denote avenues in Petersburg, a special term \"prospekt\" was introduced. Inside the grid of Vasilyevsky Island there are three prospekts, named \"Bolshoi\" (\"Big\"), \"Sredniy \"(\"Middle\") and \"Maly\" (\"Small\") while the far ends of each lines cross with the embankments of Bolshaya Neva and Smolenka rivers in the delta of the Neva River.\n\nThe peculiarity of 'lines' (streets) naming in this grid is that are each side of street has its own number, so one 'line' is a side of a street, not the whole street. The numbering is latently zero-based, however the supposed \"zero line\" has its proper name \"Kadetskaya liniya\", while the opposite side of this street is called the '1-st Line'. Next street is named the '2-nd Line' on the eastern side, and the '3-rd Line' on the western side. After the reorganization of house numbering in 1834 and 1858 the even house numbers are used on the odd-numbered lines, and respectively odd house numbers are used for the even-numbered lines. The maximum numbers for 'lines' in Petersburg are 28-29th lines.\n\nLater in the middle of the 18th century another grid of rectangular blocks with the numbered streets appeared in the continental part of the city: 13 streets named from the '1-st Rota' up to the '13-th Rota', where the companies (, ) of the Izmaylovsky Regiment were located.\n\nMany of the earliest cities in the United States, such as Boston, did not start with a grid system. However, even in pre-revolutionary days some cities saw the benefits of such a layout. New Haven Colony, one of the earliest colonies in America, was designed with a tiny 9-square grid at its founding in 1638. On a grander scale, Philadelphia was designed on a rectilinear street grid in 1682: one of the first cities in North America to use a grid system. At the urging of city founder William Penn, surveyor Thomas Holme designed a system of wide streets intersecting at right angles between the Schuylkill River to the west and the Delaware River to the east, including five squares of dedicated parkland. Penn advertised this orderly design as a safeguard against overcrowding, fire, and disease, which plagued European cities. Holme drafted an ideal version of the grid, but alleyways sprouted within and between larger blocks as the city took shape.\nAnother well known grid plan is the plan for New York City formulated in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, a proposal by the state legislature of New York for the development of most of Manhattan above Houston Street.\n\nWashington, D.C., the capital of the United States, was planned under French-American architect Pierre Charles L'Enfant. Under the L'Enfant plan, the original District of Columbia was developed using a grid plan that is interrupted by diagonal avenues, most famously Pennsylvania Avenue. These diagonals are often connected by traffic circles, such as Dupont Circle and Washington Circle. As the city grew, the plan was duplicated to cover most of the remainder of the capital. Meanwhile, the core of the city faced disarray and the McMillan Plan, led by Senator James McMillan, was adopted to build a National Mall and a parks system that is still today a jewel of the city.\n\nOften, some of the streets in a grid are numbered (First, Second, etc.), lettered, or arranged in alphabetical order. Downtown San Diego uses all three schemes: north-south streets are numbered from west to east, and east-west streets are split between a lettered series running southward from A through L and a series of streets named after trees or plants, running northward alphabetically from Ash to Walnut. As in many cities, some of these streets have been given new names violating the system (the former D Street is now Broadway, the former 12th Avenue is now Park Boulevard, etc.); this has meant that 2nd, not 1st, is the most common street name in the United States.\n\nAn exception to the typical, uniform grid is the plan of Savannah, Georgia (1733), known as the Oglethorpe Plan. It is a composite, cellular city block consisting of four large corner blocks, four small blocks in between and a public square in the centre; the entire composition of approximately ten acres (four hectares) is known as a ward. Its cellular structure includes all the primary land uses of a neighborhood and has for that reason been called fractal. Its street configuration presages modern traffic calming techniques applied to uniform grids where certain selected streets become discontinuous or narrow, thus discouraging through traffic. The configuration also represents an example of functional shared space, where pedestrian and vehicular traffic can safely and comfortably coexist.\n\nIn the westward development of the United States, the use of the grid plan was nearly universal in the construction of new settlements, such as in Salt Lake City (1870), Dodge City (1872) and Oklahoma City (1890). In these western cities the streets were numbered even more carefully than in the east to suggest future prosperity and metropolitan status.\n\nOne of the main advantages of the grid plan was that it allowed the rapid subdivision and auction of a large parcel of land. For example, when the legislature of the Republic of Texas decided in 1839 to move the capital to a new site along the Colorado River, the functioning of the government required the rapid population of the town, which was named Austin. Charged with the task, Edwin Waller designed a fourteen-block grid that fronted the river on 640 acres (exactly 1 square mile; about 2.6 km²). After surveying the land, Waller organized the almost immediate sale of 306 lots, and by the end of the year the entire Texas government had arrived by oxcart at the new site. Apart from the speed of surveying advantage, the rationale at the time of the grid's adoption in this and other cities remains obscure.\n\nIldefonso Cerdá, a Spanish civil engineer, defined a concept of urban planning, based on the grid, that he applied to the Eixample of Barcelona. The Eixample grid introduced innovative design elements which were exceptional at the time and even unique among subsequent grid plans:\nThese innovations he based on functional grounds: the block size, to enable the creation of a quiet interior open space (60 m by 60 m) and allow ample sunlight and ventilation to its perimeter buildings; the rectilinear geometry, the wide streets and boulevards to sustain high mobility and the truncated corners to facilitate turning of carts and coaches and particularly vehicles on fixed rails.\n\nIn maps of larger American cities the downtown areas are almost always grids. These areas represent the original land dimensions of the founded city, generally around one square mile. Some cities expanded the grid further out from the centre, but maps also show that, in general, as the distance from the centre increases, a variety of patterns emerge in no particular discernible order. In juxtaposition to the grid they appear random. These new patterns have been systematically classified and their design characteristics measured.\n\nIn the United States, the grid system was widely used in most major cities and their suburbs until the 1960s. However, during the 1920s, the rapid adoption of the automobile caused a panic among urban planners, who, based on observation, claimed that speeding cars would eventually kill tens of thousands of small children per year. Apparently, at this early stage of the car's entry into the grid, the streets of major cities worldwide were the scene of virtual \"slaughter\" as the fatality rate in proportion to population was more than double the current rate. In 2009, after several decades of road safety improvements and a continuous decline in fatalities, an estimated 33,963 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes and, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \"Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children from 3 to 14 years old.\" Planners, therefore, called for an inwardly focused \"superblock\" arrangement that minimized through automobile traffic and discouraged cars from traveling on anything but arterial roads; traffic generators, such as apartment complexes and shops, would be restricted to the edges of the superblock, along the arterial. This paradigm prevailed between about 1930 and 1960, especially in Los Angeles, where notable examples include Leimert Park (an early example) and Panorama City (a late-period one).\n\nA prominent 20th century urbanist, Lewis Mumford, severely criticized some of the grid's characteristics: \"With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the municipal engineer could, without the slightest training as either an architect or a sociologist, 'plan' a metropolis, with its standard lots, its standard blocks, its standard street widths, in short, with its standardized comparable, and replaceable parts. The new gridiron plans were spectacular in their inefficiency and waste. By usually failing to discriminate sufficiently between main arteries and residential streets, the first were not made wide enough while the second were usually too wide for purely neighborhood functions... as for its contribution to the permanent social functions of the city, the anonymous gridiron plan proved empty.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, traffic engineers and urban planners abandoned the grid virtually wholesale in favor of a \"street hierarchy\". This is a thoroughly \"asymmetric\" street arrangement in which a residential subdivision—often surrounded by a noise wall or a security gate—is completely separated from the road network except for one or two connections to arterial roads. In a way, this is a return to medieval styles: as noted in Spiro Kostof's seminal history of urban design, \"The City Shaped\", there is a strong resemblance between the street arrangements of modern American suburbs and those of medieval Arab and Moorish cities. In each case, the community unit at hand—the clan or extended family in the Muslim world, the economically homogeneous subdivision in modern suburbia—isolates itself from the larger urban scene by using dead ends and \"culs-de-sac\".\n\nOne famous grid system is in the British new town of Milton Keynes. In this planned city, which began construction in 1967, a system of ten \"horizontal\" (roughly east-west) and eleven \"vertical\" (roughly north-south) roads was used, with roundabouts at each intersection. The horizontal roads were all given names ending in 'way' and H numbers (for 'horizontal', e.g. H3 Monks Way). The vertical roads were given names ending in 'street' and V numbers (for 'vertical', e.g. V6 Grafton Street). Each grid road was spaced roughly one kilometre along from the next, forming squares of approximately one square kilometre. Each square and each roundabout was given its own name. The system provided very easy transport within the city, although it confused visitors who were unfamiliar with the system. The grid squares thus formed are far larger than the city blocks described earlier, and the road layouts within the grid squares are generally 'organic' in form – matching the street hierarchy model described above.\n\n\"Street width\", or right of way (ROW), influences the amount of land that is devoted to streets, which becomes unavailable for development and therefore represents an opportunity cost. The wider the street, the higher the opportunity cost. Street width is determined by circulation and aesthetic considerations and is not dependent on the pattern configuration. Any configuration can have wide or narrow streets.\n\n\"Street length\" influences proportionately the amount of street components that have to be constructed such as pavement, curbs and sidewalks, storm sewers and drains, light poles, and trees. The street length of a given area of development depends on the frequency at which streets occur which in turn depends on the length and width of a block. The higher the frequency of streets the longer is their total length. The smaller the block dimensions the higher the frequency of the streets. As the frequency of street increases so does the number of intersections. Intersections normally cost more than straight street length because they are labour-intensive and require street and traffic signage.\n\n\"Pavement width\" influences the cost by affecting the amount of materials and labour required to provide a finished road surface. Pavement width is generally based on traffic engineering considerations and is not dependent on pattern configuration. As with the street width, any pattern can have wide or narrow pavements.\nOf all three factors that affect cost, street width, street length and pavement width, only street length is pattern dependent. An objective cost comparison would, therefore, rely on this variable with the full understanding that the other variables, though optional, can play a role.\n\nTraditional orthogonal grid patterns generally have greater street frequencies than discontinuous patterns. For example, Portland's block is 200 feet × 200 feet while Miletus' is half that size and Timgad's half again (see diagram). Houston, Sacramento and Barcelona are progressively bigger reaching up to four times the area of Portland's block. New York's 1811 plan (see above) has blocks of . in width and variable lengths ranging from about 500 to 900 feet. The corresponding frequency of streets for each of these block sizes affects the street length.\n\nA simple example of a grid street pattern (see diagram) illustrates the progressive reduction in \"total\" street length (the sum of all individual street lengths) and the corresponding increase in block length. For a corresponding reduction of one, two, three and four streets within this parcel, the street length is reduced from an original total of 12,600 to 7,680 linear feet, a 39% reduction. Simultaneously, block lengths increase from 200 × 200 feet to 1240 × 200 feet. When all five blocks have reached the ultimate size of four street lengths out of total eight have been eliminated. Block lengths of 1000 feet or larger rarely appear in grid plans and are not recommended as they hinder pedestrian movement (Pedestrianism, below). From the pedestrian perspective, the smaller the block is, the easier the navigation and the more direct the route. Consequently, the finer grids are preferred.\n\nPatterns that incorporate discontinuous street types such as crescents and culs-de-sac have not, in general, regarded pedestrian movement as a priority and, consequently, have produced blocks that are usually in the 1000-foot range and often exceed it. As a result, street frequency drops and so does the \"total\" street length and, therefore, the cost. In general, it is not the street pattern per se that affects costs but the frequency of streets that it either necessitates or purposely incorporates.\n\nAn inherent advantage of the orthogonal geometry of a proper grid is its tendency to yield regular lots in well-packed sequences. This maximizes the use of the land of the block; it does not, however, affect street frequency. Any frequency of orthogonal streets produces the same packing effect. Orthogonal geometry also minimizes disputes over lot boundaries and maximizes the number of lots that could front a given street. John Randal said Manhattan's grid plan facilitated \"buying, selling and improving real estate\".\n\nAnother important aspect of street grids and the use of rectilinear blocks is that traffic flows of either pedestrians, cars, or both, only cross at right angles. This is an important traffic safety feature, since no one entering the intersection needs to look over their shoulder to see oncoming traffic. Any time traffic flows meet at an acute angle, someone cannot see traffic approaching them. The grid is thus a geometric response to our human physiology. It is very likely the original purpose of grid layouts comes from the Athenian Agora. Before the grid organization, markets were laid out randomly in a field with traffic approaches at odd angles. This caused carts and wagons to turn over due to frequent collisions. Laying out the market stalls into regularized rows at right angles solved this problem and was later built into the Athenian Agora and copied ever since.\n\nTypical uniform grids are unresponsive to topography. Priene's plan, for example, is set on a hill side and most of its north-south streets are stepped, a feature that would have made them inaccessible to carts, chariots and loaded animals. Many modern cities, such as San Francisco, Vancouver, and Saint John, New Brunswick, follow Priene's example, \"e.g.\". In a modern context, steep grades limit accessibility by car, and more so by bicycle, on foot, or wheelchair, particularly in cold climates.\n\nThe same inflexibility of the grid leads to disregarding environmentally sensitive areas such as small streams and creeks or mature woodlots in preference for the application of the immutable geometry. It is said of the NY grid plan that it flattened all obstacles in its way. By contrast, recent discontinuous street patterns follow the configuration of natural features without disrupting them. The grid represents a rationalist, reductionist solution to a multifaceted issue.\n\nThe grid's inherent high street and intersection frequencies produce large areas of impermeable surfaces in the street pavement and the sidewalks. In comparison to recent networks with discontinuous street types, grids can be up to 30% higher in impermeable surfaces attributable to roads. The emerging environmental priority of retaining as much as 90% of rain water on site becomes problematic with high percentages of impermeable surfaces. And since roads constitute the largest share of the total impermeable surfaces of a development, the difficulty is compounded by the grid type of layout. For these reasons modern planners have attempted to modify the rigid, uniform, classic grid.\n\nSome cities, notably Seattle, have devised means to improve a street's retention capacity. However, frequent intersections as they occur in a regular grid would pose an obstacle to their effective application.\n\nA street network pattern can affect the production of pollutants by the amount of car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to pedestrians. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of pollutant emissions. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20 mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50 mph. This effect is accentuated with high traffic density in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.\n\nIn his seminal study (1982) on livable streets that was conducted in neighbourhoods with a grid, Donald Appleyard showed that social networking and street playing degraded as traffic increased on a street. His research provided the groundwork for traffic calming and for several initiatives such as living streets and Home Zones, all of which are aimed at improving a street's social milieu. The amount of traffic on a street depends on variables such as the population density of the neighbourhood, car ownership and its proximity to commercial, institutional or recreational edifices. Most importantly, however, it depends on whether a street is or could become a through road to a destination. As a through road, it could sustain unpredictable levels of traffic that may fluctuate during the day and increase over time.\n\nA key characteristic of the grid pattern is that any and all streets are equally accessible to traffic (non-hierarchical) and could be chosen at will as alternative routes to a destination. Cut-through driving, or shortcutting, has been resisted by residents. Cities responded by making modifications to prevent it. Current recommended design practice suggests the use of 3-way intersections to alleviate it.\n\nThe geometry of the normal, open grid is evidently unsuitable for protecting or enhancing the social environment of a street from the negative influence of traffic. Similarly, a 1972 ground-breaking study by Oscar Newman on a Defensible Space Theory described ways to improve the social environment and security of neighbourhoods and streets. In a practical application of his theory at Five Oaks, the neighbourhood's grid pattern was modified to prevent through traffic and create identifiable smaller enclaves while maintaining complete pedestrian freedom of movement. The positive outcome of these changes reinforces Appleyard's findings and the need to reduce or prevent through traffic on neighbourhood streets; a need that cannot be met with a typical, uniform, open grid.\n\nThe question of neighbourhood security has been a constant focus of research since Oscar Newman's work. New research has expanded the discussion on this disputed issue. A recent study did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified subtle nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, dwelling types, unit density (site density) movement on the street, culs–de-sac or grids and the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters, density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level, local movement is beneficial, but not larger scale movement, relative affluence and the number of neighbours have a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. It also re-established that simple, linear culs-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The overprovision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard. The open, uniform grid could be seen as an example of undifferentiated permeability.\n\nA recent study in California examined the amount of child play that occurred on the streets of neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and culs-de-sac. The findings indicate that the open grid streets showed substantially lower play activity than the cul-de-sac street type. Culs-de-sac reduce perceived danger from traffic thereby encouraging more outdoor play. It pointed the way toward the development of hybrid street network patterns that improve pedestrian movement but restrict cut-through driving. Similar studies in Europe and most recently in Australia found that children's outdoor play is significantly reduced on through roads where traffic is, or perceived by parents to be, a risk.\n\nTraditional street functions such as kids' play, strolling and socializing are incompatible with traffic flow, which the open, uniform grid geometry encourages. For these reasons, cities such as Berkeley, California, and Vancouver, British Columbia, among many others, transformed existing residential streets part of a grid plan into permeable, linked culs-de-sac. This transformation retains the permeability and connectivity of the grid for the active modes of transport but filters and restricts car traffic on the cul-de-sac street to residents only.\n\nStreet networks of old cities that grew organically, though admired for being picturesque, can be confusing for visitors but rarely for the original inhabitants (see plan). Similarly confusing to visitors are the plans of modern subdivisions with discontinuous and curvilinear streets. Change of street orientation, particularly when gradual or arbitrary, cannot be \"mapped\" in the mind. Impasses, crescents or cul-de-sacs frustrate the traveler especially when they are long, forcing an arduous retracing of steps.\n\nFrequency of intersections, however, becomes also a disadvantage for pedestrians and bicycles. It disrupts the relaxed canter of walking and forces pedestrians repeatedly onto the road, a hostile, anxiety-generating territory. People with physical limitations or frailties, children and seniors for example, can find a regular walk challenging. For bicycles this disadvantage is accentuated as their normal speed is at least double that of pedestrians. Frequent stops negate the speed advantage and the physical benefit of bicycling and add to frustration. Intersections are not only unpleasant but also dangerous. Most traffic collisions and injuries occur at intersections and the majority of the injuries to pedestrians crossing \"with\" the right of way.\n\nA dilemma arises from trying to meet important planning objectives when using the grid: pedestrianism, cost efficiency and environmental responsiveness. To serve pedestrians well, a rectangular configuration and high frequency of streets and intersections is the preferred route, which the orthogonal grid geometry provides. To reduce development costs and environmental impact, lower frequency of streets is the logical path. Since these two design objectives are contradictory a balance needs to be struck. Such balance has been achieved in leading modern projects such as Vauban, Freiburg and Village Homes, Davis. Both score high in pedestrian and bike mode share and, at the same time, in reducing negative development externalities. Their layout configurations represent a fusion of the classic grid plan with recent street network patterns.\n\nExamining the issue of walkability, a recent comparison of seven neighbourhood layouts found a 43 and 32 percent increase in walking with respect to a grid plan and conventional suburban layout in a fused grid layout, which has greater permeability for pedestrians than for cars due to its inclusion of dedicated pedestrian paths. It also showed a 7 to 10 percent range of reduction in driving with respect to the remainder six neighbourhood layouts in the set, an environmental benefit.\n\nPerceived and actual safety play a role in the use of the street. Perceived safety, though perhaps an inaccurate reflection of the number of injuries or fatalities, influences parents' decision to allow their children to play, walk or bike on the street. Actual levels of safety as measured by the total number of collisions and the number and severity of injuries are a matter of public concern. Both should inform the layout, if the street network is to achieve its optimum use.\n\nRecent studies have found higher traffic fatality rates in outlying suburban areas than in central cities and inner suburbs with smaller blocks and more-connected street patterns. While some of this disparity is the result of distance from emergency medical facilities (hospitals are usually built in a fairly late stage of the development of a suburban area), it is clear that the lower speeds encouraged by the frequency of intersections decrease the severity of accidents occurring on streets within a grid plan.\n\nAn earlier study found significant differences in recorded accidents between residential neighbourhoods that were laid out on a grid and those that included culs-de-sac and crescents. The frequency of accidents was significantly higher in the grid neighbourhoods.\n\nTwo newer studies examined the frequency of collisions in two regional districts using the latest analytical tools. They investigated the potential correlation between street network patterns and frequency of collisions. In one study, cul-de-sac networks appeared to be much safer than grid networks, by nearly three to one.\nA second study found the grid plan to be the least safe by a significant margin with respect to all other street patterns.\n\nA 2009 study suggests that land use patterns play a significant role in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern. While all intersection types in general reduce the incidence of fatal crashes, four-way intersections, which occur regularly in a grid, increase total and injurious crashes significantly. The study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable.\n\nStringent adherence to the grid plan can cause steep inclines since the topology of the land is not taken into account. This may be unsafe for drivers, pedestrians and bicycles since it is more difficult to control speed and braking, particularly in winter conditions.\n\nOne of the greatest difficulties with grid plans is their lack of specialisation, most of the important amenities being concentrated along the city's main arteries. Often grid plans are found in linear settlements, with a main street connecting between the perpendicular roads. However, this can be mitigated by allowing mixed use development so that destinations become closer to home. Many cities, especially in Latin America, still successfully retain their grid plans. Recently, planners in the United States and Canada have revisited the idea of reintroducing grid patterns to many cities and towns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the frame of the general diglossia status of the Arab world, Levantine Arabic is used for daily spoken use, while most of the written and official documents and media use Modern Standard Arabic.\n\nLevantine Arabic is most closely related to North Mesopotamian Arabic, Anatolian Arabic, and Cypriot Arabic.\n\nDialects include:\n\nDialects include:\n\nLevantine Arabic is spoken in the fertile strip on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. To the east, in the desert, Northwest Arabian Arabic varieties are spoken by Bedouins. The transition to Egyptian Arabic in the south via the Negev and Sinai Peninsula, where Northwest Arabian Arabic is spoken and then the dialect of Sharqia Governorate, was described by de Jong in 1999. In this direction, the Egyptian city of Arish is the last one to display proper Levantine features. In a similar manner, the region of el-Karak announces Hijazi Arabic. In the North, the limit between Gilit Mesopotamian Arabic starts from the Turkish border near el-Rāʿi, and Sabkhat al-Jabbul is the north-eastern limit of Levantine Arabic, which includes further south al-Qaryatayn Damascus, and the Hauran.\n\nNorth Levantine stems from the north in Turkey, specifically in the coastal regions of the Adana, Hatay, and Mersin provinces, to Lebanon, passing through the Mediterranean coastal regions of Syria (the Al Ladhiqiyah and Tartus governorates) as well as the areas surrounding Aleppo and Damascus.\n\nSouth Levantine is spoken in Palestine, as well as in the western area of Jordan (in the ‘Ajlun, Al Balqa’, Al Karak, Al Mafraq, ‘Amman, Irbid, Jarash, and Madaba governorates).\nThe language is also spoken in the HaZafon district of Israel, south of Lebanon.\n\nAlthough small communities of Arabic speakers were present prior to the Muslim conquest of the Levant, it is widely accepted that during the Roman and Byzantine periods, varieties of Greek-influenced Aramaic were the dominant spoken language of Palestine. The language shift from Aramaic to Arabic, both Semitic languages, that began in the 7th century after the conquests, was not a sudden switch from one language to another, but a long process over several generations, likely with an extended period of bilingualism. Some communities, such as the Samaritans, retained Aramaic well into the Muslim period, and a few small Aramaic-speaking villages had remained until the recent Syrian Civil War.\n\nAncient Arabia was home to a continuum of Central Semitic languages in antiquity which stretched from the southern Levant to Yemen. The isoglosses associated with Arabic are clustered at the northern end of this continuum, in the northern Hijaz and the southern Levant. This may be in part due to a lack of documentation, but it is clear that Central Arabia was home to languages quite distinct from Arabic. Thus, Arabic can be said to have emerged in the second millennium BC and spread into the peninsula, replacing its sister languages on the Central Semitic continuum.\n\nThe primary division between Arabic dialects in ancient times was between Northern Old Arabic, spoken in the southern Levant, and Old Hijazi, spoken in the northern, and later central Hijaz. The main representatives of Northern Old Arabic were Safaitic, Hismaic, and Nabataean Arabic. Tens of thousands of graffiti in the Safaitic and Hismaic scripts cover the deserts of southern Syria and present-day Jordan. The Safaitic inscriptions sometimes exhibit the article ʾ(l), a shared areal isogloss with the Arabic substrate of the Nabataean inscriptions. Many Safaitic inscriptions exhibit all of the features typical of Arabic. The Hismaic script was used to compose two long texts in an archaic stage of Arabic before the language acquired the definite article.\n\nBefore the mid-sixth century, the coda of the definite article almost never exhibits assimilation to the following coronals and its onset is consistently given with an /a/ vowel. By the mid-sixth century CE in the dialect of Petra, the onset of the article and its vowel seem to have become weakened. There, the article is sometimes written as /el-/ or simply /l-/. A similar, but not identical, situation is found in the texts from the Islamic period. Unlike the pre-Islamic attestations, the coda of the article in the conquest Arabic assimilates to a following coronal consonant. The Arabic transcribed in the 1st century AH papyri clearly represents a different strand of the Arabic language, likely related to Old Hijazi and the QCT.\n\nThe Damascus Psalm Fragment, dated to the mid- to late 9th century but possibly earlier, provides a glimpse of the vernacular of at least one segment of Damascene society during that period. Its linguistic features also shed light on a pre-grammarian standard of Arabic and the dialect from which it sprung, likely Old Hijazi.\n\nThe \"Compendio\" of Lucas Caballero (1709) contains a description of spoken Damascene Arabic in the early 1700s. In some respects, the data given in this manuscript correspond to modern Damascene Arabic. For example, the allomorphic variation between -\"a\"/-\"e\" in the feminine suffix is essentially identical. In other respects, especially when it comes to insertion and deletion of vowels, it differs from the modern dialect. The presence of short vowels in /zibībih/ and /sifīnih/ point to an earlier stage of linguistic development, before elision led to the modern \"zbībe\" and \"sfīne\", though the orthography of the manuscript is in this respect unclear.\n\nThe existence of Hismaic and Safaitic varieties without a definite article strongly suggests that their ancestor lacked a morphological means of definiteness. The definite article entered these varieties through contact with Northwest Semitic languages in the southern Levant. Evidence for such contact is given by a possibly bilingual North Arabian-Canaanite inscription containing a prayer to the gods Malkom, Kemōš, and Qaws.\n\nThere is evidence that a peripheral variety of Aramaic with archaic phonology existed in the southern Levant and possibly northern Arabia during the late first millennium BCE. This variety retained a velar/uvular realization of *\"ṣ́\", as evidenced by an inscription with a prayer to the deity \"Rqy\". Not all Aramaic features in early Islamic literature have necessarily been mediated by Christians and Aramaic has a longer history in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nNabataean Aramaic was extremely close to, but not identical with, Achaemenid Official Aramaic and may have been connected with the wider speech area. The use of the direct object marker \"yt\" /yāt/ seems to have been taken over from a Western form of Aramaic with which the inhabitants of the Nabataean kingdom may have been in contact. It may have entered Nabataean via a Syrian or Palestinian dialect through Moab or the Hawran area where Aramaic had a longer history and would supposedly have been spoken more widely.\n\nThe coexistence of Nabataean and Jewish Palestinian Aramaic in contracts from the Dead Sea show that Nabataeans were indeed exposed to other forms of Aramaic. The continuity of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, the emergence of Samaritan as well as Christian Palestinian Aramaic as written languages, and the eventual development of vocalization traditions makes it possible to define Western Aramaic as a dialect group more clearly in the later Roman period than before.\n\nThe degree to which Aramaic survived as a vernacular in Palestine after the 8th century CE is difficult to assess. One may suppose that the modern Western Aramaic dialects still spoken in the Christian mountain villages of Maʿlūla, Baḫʿa, and Ǧubb ʿAdīn in the Antilebanon once have evolved from the same linguistic matrix as the older, now extinct Western Aramaic varieties that appear in the inscriptions and manuscript traditions of late Roman Palestine.\n\nThe existence of Aramaic substrate elements in Palestinian Arabic, the supplanting language of Palestinian Aramaic dialects, is widely accepted and is especially evident in the lexical component.\n\n\n"}

This article lists the character entity references that are valid in HTML and XML documents.\n\nA character entity reference refers to the content of a named entity. An entity declaration is created by using the codice_1 syntax in a Document Type Definition (DTD).\n\nA \"numeric character reference\" refers to a character by its Universal Character Set/Unicode \"code point\", and uses the format:\nor\n\nwhere \"nnnn\" is the code point in decimal form, and \"hhhh\" is the code point in hexadecimal form. The \"x\" must be lowercase in XML documents. The \"nnnn\" or \"hhhh\" may be any number of digits and may include leading zeros. The \"hhhh\" may mix uppercase and lowercase, though uppercase is the usual style.\n\nIn contrast, a \"character entity reference\" refers to a character by the name of an \"entity\" which has the desired character as its \"replacement text\". The entity must either be predefined (built into the markup language) or explicitly declared in a Document Type Definition (DTD). The format is the same as for any entity reference:\n\nwhere \"name\" is the case-sensitive name of the entity. The semicolon is required.\n\nISO Entity Sets: SGML supplied a comprehensive set of entity declarations for characters widely used in Western technical and reference publishing, for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts. The American Mathematical Society also contributed entities for mathematical characters.\n\nHTML Entity Sets: Early versions of HTML built in small subsets of these, relating to characters found in three Western 8-bit fonts.\n\nMathML Entity Sets: The W3C developed a set of entity declarations for MathML characters.\n\nXML Entity Sets: The W3C MathML Working Group took over maintenance of the ISO public entity sets, combined with the MathML and documents them in XML Entity Definitions for Characters. This set can support the requirements of XHTML, MathML and as an input to future versions of HTML.\n\nHTML 5: HTML5 adopts the XML entities as named character references, however it restates them without reference to their sources and does not group them into sets. The HTML 5 specification additionally provides mappings from the names to Unicode character sequences using JSON.\n\nNumerous other entity sets have been developed for special requirements, and for major and minority scripts. However, the advent of Unicode has largely superseded them.\n\nThe XML specification does not use the term \"character entity\" or \"character entity reference\". The XML specification defines five \"predefined entities\" representing special characters, and requires that all XML processors honor them. The entities can be explicitly declared in a DTD, as well, but if this is done, the replacement text must be the same as the built-in definitions. XML also allows other named entities of any size to be defined on a per-document basis.\n\nThe table below lists the five XML predefined entities. The \"Name\" column mentions the entity's name. The \"Character\" column shows the character. To render the character, the format codice_8 is used; for example, codice_9 renders as &. The \"Unicode code point\" column cites the character via standard UCS/Unicode \"U+\" notation, which shows the character's code point in hexadecimal. The decimal equivalent of the code point is then shown in parentheses. The \"Standard\" column indicates the first version of XML that includes the entity. The \"Description\" column cites the character via its canonical UCS/Unicode name, in English.\n\nThe HTML 4 DTDs define 252 named entities, references to which act as mnemonic aliases for certain Unicode characters. The HTML 4 specification requires the use of the standard DTDs and does not allow users to define additional entities.\n\nIn the table below, the \"Standard\" column indicates the first version of the HTML DTD that defines the character entity reference. HTML 4.01 does not provide any new character references.\n\nTo use one of these character entity references in an HTML or XML document, enter an ampersand followed by the entity name and a semicolon, e.g., codice_9 for the ampersand (\"&\").\n\nNotes:\nThe XHTML DTDs explicitly declare 253 entities (including the 5 predefined entities of XML 1.0) whose expansion is a single character, which can therefore be informally referred to as \"character entities\". These (with the exception of the codice_11 entity) have the same names and represent the same characters as the 252 character entities in HTML. Also, by virtue of being XML, XHTML documents may reference the predefined codice_11 entity, which is not one of the 252 character entities in HTML. Additional entities of any size may be defined on a per-document basis. However, the usability of entity references in XHTML is affected by how the document is being processed:\n\n\nBecause of the special codice_11 case mentioned above, only codice_15, codice_9, codice_17, and codice_18 will work in all processing situations.\n\n\n\n"}

In Sweden, she is perhaps most known under the name Mathilda Montgomery-Cederhjelm.\n\nMathilda was born in Italy to the Spanish ambassador in Milan, Count Nicolas Blasco d'Orozco and Sabina Lederer. She was first married to marquess Cenami, Stable Master of the court of the sister of Napoleon, Princess Elisa Bonaparte. She was widowed before she was twenty. In 1817 in Vienna, she married second to the Swedish Count colonel Josias Montgomery-Cederhjelm (d. 1825), with whom she had four children. In 1839, she married the Swedish Baron Carl Alexander Fredrik Gyllenhaal.\n\nIn connection with her second marriage (1817), Mathilda d'Orozco moved to Sweden, where she was to live the rest of her life. In Sweden, she became a noted socialite in the capital, later called \"one of the most noted ornaments in the salons of high society during the first happy and vibrant period of the reign of Charles XIV John\" (reign 1818–1844). Used to the warmer climate of Italy, she once remarked : \"God was angry when he created the Swedish climate!\" She was described as a warm person with great charm and talent within many fields of art, which she developed in her hectic social life. As a member of the nobility, she was presented at the royal court, and took part in the court life of King Charles John and Queen Désirée, where she became a centre of the court's entertainment. She was an admired, versatile singer, who sometimes accompanied her singing by playing the harp; she also took part in the amateur theatre of the royal court, where she was described as an actress \"hors ligne\", and was seen as a natural, fairylike dancer. The Crown Prince, Oscar, as well as the British ambassador John Bloomfield, 2nd Baron Bloomfield were counted among her admirers. After her third marriage (1839), she withdrew from society life and moved to her husband's estate out in the countryside, except for annual visits to the Norrtälje seaside resort. She died, aged 67, at Stora Ekeby, Rytterne, Sweden.\n\nGustaf Lagerbjelke dedicated to her the poem \"L'une et l'autre\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20420", "title": "Multimedia", "text": "Multimedia\n\nMultimedia is content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video and interactive content. Multimedia contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material.\n\nMultimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by information content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance. Multimedia devices are electronic media devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is distinguished from mixed media in fine art; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. In the early years of multimedia the term \"rich media\" was synonymous with interactive multimedia, and \"hypermedia\" was an application of multimedia.\n\nThe term \"multimedia\" was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later 'Bobb Goldsteinn') to promote the July 1966 opening of his \"LightWorks at L'Oursin\" show at Southampton, Long Island. Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called \"intermedia\".\n\nOn August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of \"Variety\" borrowed the terminology, reporting: \"Brainchild of songscribe-comic Bob ('Washington Square') Goldstein, the 'Lightworks' is the latest \"multi-media\" music-cum-visuals to debut as discothèque fare.\" Two years later, in 1968, the term \"multimedia\" was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer—one of Goldstein's producers at L'Oursin.\n\nIn the 1993 first edition of \"Multimedia: Making It Work\", Tay Vaughan declared \"Multimedia is any combination of text, graphic art, sound, animation, and video that is delivered by computer. When you allow the user – the viewer of the project – to control what and when these elements are delivered, it is \"interactive multimedia\". When you provide a structure of linked elements through which the user can navigate, interactive multimedia becomes \"hypermedia\".\"\n\nThe German language society Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache recognized the word's significance and ubiquitousness in the 1990s by awarding it the title of German 'Word of the Year' in 1995. The institute summed up its rationale by stating \"[Multimedia] has become a central word in the wonderful new media world\".\n\nIn common usage, \"multimedia\" refers to an electronically delivered combination of media including video, still images, audio, and text in such a way that can be accessed interactively. Much of the content on the web today falls within this definition as understood by millions. Some computers which were marketed in the 1990s were called \"multimedia\" computers because they incorporated a CD-ROM drive, which allowed for the delivery of several hundred megabytes of video, picture, and audio data. That era saw also a boost in the production of educational multimedia CD-ROMs.\n\nThe term \"video\", if not used exclusively to describe motion photography, is ambiguous in multimedia terminology. \"Video\" is often used to describe the file format, delivery format, or presentation format instead of \"footage\" which is used to distinguish motion photography from \"animation\" of rendered motion imagery. Multiple forms of information content are often not considered modern forms of presentation such as audio or video. Likewise, single forms of information content with single methods of information processing (e.g. non-interactive audio) are often called multimedia, perhaps to distinguish static media from active media. In the fine arts, for example, Leda Luss Luyken's ModulArt brings two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting: variation of a theme and movement of and within a picture, making \"ModulArt\" an interactive multimedia form of art. Performing arts may also be considered multimedia considering that performers and props are multiple forms of both content and media.\n\nMultimedia presentations may be viewed by person on stage, projected, transmitted, or played locally with a media player. A broadcast may be a live or recorded multimedia presentation. Broadcasts and recordings can be either analog or digital electronic media technology. Digital online multimedia may be downloaded or streamed. Streaming multimedia may be live or on-demand.\n\nMultimedia games and simulations may be used in a physical environment with special effects, with multiple users in an online network, or locally with an offline computer, game system, or simulator.\n\nThe various formats of technological or digital multimedia may be intended to enhance the users' experience, for example to make it easier and faster to convey information. Or in entertainment or art, to transcend everyday experience.\nEnhanced levels of interactivity are made possible by combining multiple forms of media content. Online multimedia is increasingly becoming object-oriented and data-driven, enabling applications with collaborative end-user innovation and personalization on multiple forms of content over time. Examples of these range from multiple forms of content on Web sites like photo galleries with both images (pictures) and title (text) user-updated, to simulations whose co-efficients, events, illustrations, animations or videos are modifiable, allowing the multimedia \"experience\" to be altered without reprogramming. In addition to seeing and hearing, haptic technology enables virtual objects to be felt. Emerging technology involving illusions of taste and smell may also enhance the multimedia experience.\n\nMultimedia may be broadly divided into linear and non-linear categories:\n\nMultimedia presentations can be live or recorded:\n\nMultimedia finds its application in various areas including, but not limited to, advertisements, art, education, entertainment, engineering, medicine, mathematics, business, scientific research and spatial temporal applications. Several examples are as follows:\n\nCreative industries use multimedia for a variety of purposes ranging from fine arts, to entertainment, to commercial art, to journalism, to media and software services provided for any of the industries listed below. An individual multimedia designer may cover the spectrum throughout their career. Request for their skills range from technical, to analytical, to creative.\n\nMuch of the electronic old and new media used by commercial artists and graphic designers is multimedia. Exciting presentations are used to grab and keep attention in advertising. Business to business, and interoffice communications are often developed by creative services firms for advanced multimedia presentations beyond simple slide shows to sell ideas or liven up training. Commercial multimedia developers may be hired to design for governmental services and nonprofit services applications as well.\n\nMultimedia is heavily used in the entertainment industry, especially to develop special effects in movies and animations (VFX, 3D animation, etc.). Multimedia games are a popular pastime and are software programs available either as CD-ROMs or online. Some video games also use multimedia features.\nMultimedia applications that allow users to actively participate instead of just sitting by as passive recipients of information are called \"interactive multimedia\".\nIn the arts there are multimedia artists, whose minds are able to blend techniques using different media that in some way incorporates interaction with the viewer. One of the most relevant could be Peter Greenaway who is melding cinema with opera and all sorts of digital media. Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena, such as an art gallery. Although multimedia display material may be volatile, the survivability of the content is as strong as any traditional media. Digital recording material may be just as durable and infinitely reproducible with perfect copies every time.\n\nIn education, multimedia is used to produce computer-based training courses (popularly called CBTs) and reference books like encyclopedia and almanacs. A CBT lets the user go through a series of presentations, text about a particular topic, and associated illustrations in various information formats. Edutainment is the combination of education with entertainment, especially multimedia entertainment.\n\nLearning theory in the past decade has expanded dramatically because of the introduction of multimedia. Several lines of research have evolved, e.g. cognitive load and multimedia learning.\n\nFrom multimedia learning (MML) theory, David Roberts has developed a large group lecture practice using PowerPoint and based on the use of full-slide images in conjunction with a reduction of visible text (all text can be placed in the notes view’ section of PowerPoint). The method has been applied and evaluated in 9 disciplines. In each experiment, students’ engagement and active learning has been approximately 66% greater, than with the same material being delivered using bullet points, text and speech, corroborating a range of theories presented by multimedia learning scholars like Sweller and Mayer. The idea of media convergence is also becoming a major factor in education, particularly higher education. Defined as separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video that now share resources and interact with each other, media convergence is rapidly changing the curriculum in universities all over the world.\n\nMultimedia provides students with an alternate means of acquiring knowledge designed to enhance teaching and learning through various mediums and platforms. This technology allows students to learn at their own pace and gives teachers the ability to observe the individual needs of each student. The capacity for multimedia to be used in multi-disciplinary settings is structured around the idea of creating a hands-on learning environment through the use of technology . Lessons can be tailored to the subject matter as well as be personalized to the students' varying levels of knowledge on the topic. Learning content can be managed through activities that utilize and take advantage of multimedia platforms. This kind of learning encourages interactive communication between students and teachers and opens feedback channels, introducing an active learning process especially with the prevalence of new media and social media. Technology has impacted multimedia as it is largely associated with the use of computers or other electronic devices and digital media due to its capabilities concerning research, communication, problem-solving through simulations and feedback opportunities.\n\nMultimedia is a robust education and research methodology within the social work context. The five different multimedia which supports the education process are narrative media, interactive media, communicative media, adaptive media, and productive media. Contrary to long-standing belief, multimedia technology in social work education existed before the prevalence of the internet. It takes the form of images, audio, and video into the curriculum. \n\nFirst introduced to social work education by Seabury & Maple in 1993, multimedia technology is utilized to teach social work practice skills including interviewing, crisis intervention, and group work. In comparison with conventional teaching method, including face-to-face courses, multimedia education shortens transportation time, increases knowledge and confidence in a richer and more authentic context for learning, generates interaction between online users, and enhances understanding of conceptual materials for novice students. \n\nIn an attempt to examine the impact of multimedia technology on students’ study, A. Elizabeth Cauble & Linda P. Thurston conducted a research in which Building Family Foundations (BFF), an interactive multimedia training platform, was utilized to assess social work students’ reactions to multimedia technology on variables of knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The results states that respondents show a substantial increase in academic knowledge, confidence, and attitude. Multimedia also benefits students because it brings expert to students online, fits students’ schedule, allows students to choose courses that suit them. \n\nMayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning suggests, \"people learn more from words and pictures than from words alone.\" According to Mayer and other scholars, multimedia technology stimulates people’s brains by implementing visual and auditory effects, and thereby assists online users to learn efficiently. Researchers suggest that when users establish dual channels while learning, they tend to understand and memorize better. Mixed literature of this theory are still present in the field of multimedia and social work.\n\nWith the spread and development of the English language around the world, it has become an important way of communicating between different people and cultures. Multimedia Technology creates a platform where language can be taught. The traditional form of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) in classrooms have drastically changed with the prevalence of technology, making easier for students to obtain language learning skills. Multimedia motivates students to learn more languages through audio, visual and animation support. It also helps create English contexts since an important aspect of learning a language is developing their grammar, vocabulary and knowledge of pragmatics and genres. In addition, cultural connections in terms of forms, contexts, meanings and ideologies have to be constructed. By improving thought patterns, multimedia develops students’ communicative competence by improving their capacity to understand the language. One of the studies, carried out by Izquierdo, Simard and Pulido, presented the correlation between “Multimedia Instruction (MI) and learners’ second language (L2)” and its effects on learning behavior. Their findings based on Gardner’s theory of the “socio-educational model of learner motivation and attitudes”, the study shows that there is easier access to language learning materials as well as increased motivation with MI along with the use of Computer-Assisted Language Learning.\n\nNewspaper companies all over are trying to embrace the new phenomenon by implementing its practices in their work. While some have been slow to come around, other major newspapers like \"The New York Times\", \"USA Today\" and \"The Washington Post\" are setting the precedent for the positioning of the newspaper industry in a globalized world.\n\nNews reporting is not limited to traditional media outlets. Freelance journalists can make use of different new media to produce multimedia pieces for their news stories. It engages global audiences and tells stories with technology, which develops new communication techniques for both media producers and consumers. The Common Language Project, later renamed to The Seattle Globalist, is an example of this type of multimedia journalism production.\n\nMultimedia reporters who are mobile (usually driving around a community with cameras, audio and video recorders, and laptop computers) are often referred to as mojos, from \"mo\"bile \"jo\"urnalist.\n\nSoftware engineers may use multimedia in computer simulations for anything from entertainment to training such as military or industrial training. Multimedia for software interfaces are often done as a collaboration between creative professionals and software engineers.\n\nIn mathematical and scientific research, multimedia is mainly used for modeling and simulation. For example, a scientist can look at a molecular model of a particular substance and manipulate it to arrive at a new substance. Representative research can be found in journals such as the \"Journal of Multimedia\".\n\nIn medicine, doctors can get trained by looking at a virtual surgery or they can simulate how the human body is affected by diseases spread by viruses and bacteria and then develop techniques to prevent it. Multimedia applications such as virtual surgeries also help doctors to get practical training.\n\nIn Europe, the reference organisation for the multimedia industry is the European Multimedia Associations Convention (EMMAC).\n\nScholarly conferences about multimedia include:\n\n"}

{"id": "26813607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26813607", "title": "Pacaraos Quechua", "text": "Pacaraos Quechua\n\nPacaraos Quechua is a variety of Quechua spoken until the middle of the 20th century in the community of Pacaraos (Pacaraos District) in the Peruvian Lima Region in the Chancay valley up to 3000 m above sea level.\n\nThe Quechua of Pacaraos was investigated by the Dutch linguist Willem F. H. Adelaar in the 1970s, when it was still spoken by women in their sixties and older. Around the year 2000 there were possibly no active speakers left, but there are probably some people with passive knowledge who grew up with their grandparents.\n\nA peculiarity of Pacaraos Quechua is that it does not belong to any of the two main branches of the Quechua family (Waywash and Wampuy). In contrast to other Quechua varieties, the Quechua of Pacaraos has phonemic word accent, which is either on the penultimate or the ultimate syllable. Like the Waywash varieties but in contrast to Wampuy, it distinguishes between short and long vowels.\n\nThe first person of the verb and the possessive form for nouns is expressed by accent on the last syllable and addition of -y, e.g.: tarpuy \"to sow\" (root: tarpu-) - tarpúy \"I sow\" (cf. Waywash: tarpuu, Wampuy: tarpuni) - tarpunki \"you sow\" - tarpun \"he/she sows\".\n\nThe vocabulary of Pacaraos Quechua corresponds in part with Southern Quechua (e.g. kunan \"now\"), and partially with Waywash (e.g. yarku- \"to rise\", akshu, \"potato\"). Furthermore there are many loanwords from Jaqaru or other Aymaran languages (e.g. achara \"old\", uni- \"to hate\", wilka \"sun\"). Some words of Pacaraos Quechua are unique, e.g. arapu- \"to answer\", chaqpa \"clothes\", rapqa- \"both\".\n\nPacaraos Quechua shares many suffixes with Waywash, e.g. -ĉaw \"in, on, at\" or -piqta, -piq \"from, out of\". The accusative suffix -kta has a long form -kta and a short form -k, the latter being combined with final stress. The negation suffix -su (<*-chu) is often shortened to -s.\n\nThe gerund is expressed with -shpa, as in all Wampuy varieties.\n\nThe /q/ of Proto-Quechua is a fricative, at the end of a syllable or near a voiceless consonant it is voiceless [x] and otherwise voiced [g]. In contrast to other Quechua varianties it distinguishes between a simple [r] (tap, e.g. rapqan \"they both\") and a vibrant [rr] (e.g. rraqak \"girl\").

{"id": "29019799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29019799", "title": "Pliny the Younger on Christians", "text": "Pliny the Younger on Christians\n\nPliny the Younger, the Roman governor of Bithynia et Pontus (now in modern Turkey) wrote a letter to Emperor Trajan around 112 AD and asked for counsel on dealing with Christians. The letter (\"Epistulae\" X.96) details an account of how Pliny conducted trials of suspected Christians who appeared before him as a result of anonymous accusations and asks for the Emperor's guidance on how they should be treated.\n\nNeither Pliny nor Trajan mentions the crime that Christians had committed, except for being a Christian; and other historical sources do not provide a simple answer to what that crime could be, but a likely element may be the stubborn refusal of Christians to worship Roman gods; making them appear as objecting to Roman rule.\n\nPliny states that he gives Christians multiple chances to affirm they are innocent and if they refuse three times, they are executed. Pliny states that his investigations have revealed nothing on the Christians' part but harmless practices and \"depraved, excessive superstition.\" However, Pliny seems concerned about the rapid spread of this \"superstition\"; and views Christian gatherings as a potential starting point for sedition.\n\nThe letter is the first pagan account to refer to Christianity, providing key information on early Christian beliefs and practices and how these were viewed and dealt with by the Romans. The letter and Trajan's reply indicate that at the time of its writing there was no systematic and official Empire-wide persecution of Christians. Trajan's reply also offers valuable insight into the relationship between Roman provincial governors and Emperors and indicates that at the time Christians were not sought out or tracked down by imperial orders, and that persecutions could be local and sporadic.\n\nPliny the Younger was the governor of Bithynia et Pontus on the Black Sea coast of Anatolia Turkey; having arrived there around September 111 as the representative of Roman Emperor Trajan. Pliny likely wrote the letters from Amisus before his term ended in January 113. The origin of Christianity in that region is not known, but it has not been associated with Apostle Paul's travels. Given the in the opening of the First Epistle of Peter (which dates to the 60s) Christianity in the region may have had some Petrine associations through Sylvanus.\n\nIn 111 Bithynia et Pontus was known for being in disorder, and Pliny was selected by Trajan because of his legal training and his past experience. Pliny was familiar with the region, having defended two of their proconsuls for extortion in the Senate, one case being around AD 103. However, Pliny had never performed a legal investigation of Christians, and thus consulted Trajan in order to be on solid ground regarding his actions, and saved his letters and Trajan's replies. The way he expressed his lack of familiarity with the procedure may indicate that such prosecutions against Christians had taken place before (namely in Rome), but Pliny had not been involved in them.\n\nAs governor, Pliny held large influence over all of the residents of his province. This was especially true in the legal treatment of Christians. The Roman legal construct of \"cognitio extra ordinem\" afforded governors a large amount of discretion in deciding legal cases.\n\nPrior to the 249 Decius edict which would require all inhabitants of the Roman Empire to sacrifice to the Roman gods, the persecution of Christians was based on local determinations. Timothy Barnes characterized the situation by stating: \"Actual persecution…was local, sporadic, almost random\". During this period, individual governors treated Christians very differently depending on the public and social issues, e.g. Tertullian wrote that no Christian blood was shed in Africa prior to 180.\n\nAlthough it is clear that Pliny executed Christians, neither Pliny nor Trajan mention the crime that Christians had committed, except for being a Christian; and other historical sources do not provide a simple answer to this question. Trajan's response to Pliny makes it clear that being known as a \"Christian\" was sufficient for judicial action.\n\nEverett Ferguson states that the charges against Christians by Pliny may have been partly based on the \"secret crimes\" associated with Christianity, later characterized by Athenagoras as atheism, cannibalistic feasts and incest. The cannibalistic feasts and incest charges were based on misunderstanding of the Eucharistic act and Christians being \"brothers and sisters\", even after marriage. However, the charge of atheism related to the failure to worship the state gods, and made Christianity a superstition and not a religion. George Heyman states that the refusal of Christians to participate in sacrificial rituals that honored the emperor and instead follow their own sacrificial rhetoric and practices conflicted with the Roman forms of social control, making them an undesirable minority. Ferguson states that Pliny viewed the obstinacy (\"contumacia\") of Christians as much of a threat to Roman rule and order as the divergence of their beliefs from the Romans; and considered Christian gatherings as a potential starting point for sedition.\n\nPliny opens the letter (sections 1-4) with questions to Trajan concerning trials of Christians brought before him, since he says he has never been present at any trials of Christians. This may indicate that previous trials had taken place and that Pliny was unaware of any existing edicts under Trajan for prosecuting Christians. He has three main questions: \n\nA.N. Sherwin-White states that “When the practice of a sect was banned...indictment of the \"nomen\" (“name”), i.e. of membership of a cult group, sufficed to secure conviction. This looked uncommonly like religious persecution to the victims themselves, but the underlying ground remained the \"flagitia\" (“shameful acts”) supposed to be inseparable from the practice of the cult.”\n\nPliny gives an account of how the trials are conducted and the various verdicts (sections 4-6). He says he first asks if the accused is a Christian: if they confess that they are, he interrogates them twice more, for a total of three times, threatening them with death if they continue to confirm their beliefs. If they do not recant, then he orders them to be executed, or, if they are Roman citizens, orders them to be taken to Rome. Despite his uncertainty about the offences connected with being Christian, Pliny says that he has no doubt that, whatever the nature of their creed, at least their inflexible obstinacy (\"obstinatio\") and stubbornness, (\"pertinacia\") deserve punishment. This shows that, to the Roman authorities, Christians were being hostile to the government and were openly defying a magistrate who was asking them to abandon an unwanted cult. Most notably, the Christians present at these trials Pliny is inquiring about were accused by a privately published anonymous document and not by Pliny nor the empire.\n\nThere were three categories of accused Pliny mentions with corresponding verdicts. If the accused denied that they had ever been a Christian, then once they had prayed to the Roman gods (in words dictated by Pliny himself), offered incense and wine to images of Trajan and the gods, and cursed Christ – which Pliny says true Christians are unable to do - they were then discharged. Accused who were at one point Christians but had quit the religion also followed the aforementioned procedure and were let go. Sherwin-White says the procedure was approved by Trajan but it was not a way to “compel conformity to the state religion or imperial cult,” which was a voluntary practice. Those who confessed to being Christians three times were executed.\n\nPliny then details the practices of Christians (sections 7-10): he says that they meet on a certain day before light where they gather and sing hymns to Christ as to a god. They all bind themselves by oath, \"not to some crimes\", says Pliny, as though that is what he would have expected; rather, they pledge \"not\" to commit any crimes such as fraud, theft, or adultery, and subsequently share a meal of \"ordinary and innocent food\". Pliny says, however, that all of these practices were abandoned by the Christians after Pliny forbade any political associations (\"hetaeriai\" or “fraternities”). These clubs were banned because Trajan saw them as a “natural breeding ground for grumbling” about both civic life and political affairs. One such instance of a banned club was a firemen’s association; likewise, Christianity was seen as a political association that could be potentially harmful to the empire. However the Christians seem to have willingly complied with the edict and halted their practices.\n\nPliny adds that he felt it necessary to investigate further by having two female slaves called deaconesses tortured, which was standard procedure in Roman interrogation of slaves, and discovered nothing but \"depraved, excessive superstition\" (\"superstitio\"). By using this word instead of \"religio\", religion, Pliny is \"denigrating the Christians' position\" because it was outside the religious practices of Rome. The apparent abandonment of the pagan temples by Christians was a threat to the \"pax deorum\" (the harmony or accord between the divine and humans), and political subversion by new religious groups was feared, which was treated as a potential crime.\n\nPliny ends the letter by saying that Christianity is endangering people of every age and rank and has spread not only through the cities, but also through the rural villages as well (\"neque tantum...sed etiam\"), but that it will be possible to check it. He argues for his procedure to Trajan by saying that the temples and religious festivals, which before had been deserted, are now flourishing again and that there is a rising demand for sacrificial animals once more – a dip and rise which A.N. Sherwin-White believes is an exaggeration of the toll Christianity had taken on the traditional cult.\n\nTrajan’s short reply to Pliny overall affirms Pliny’s procedure and details four orders: (1) Do not seek out the Christians for trial. (2) If the accused are guilty of being Christian, then they must be punished. (3) If the accused deny they are Christians and show proof that they are not by worshipping the gods, then they will be pardoned. (4) Pliny should not allow anonymous accusations. Leonard L. Thompson calls the policy “double-edged,” since, “on the one hand, Christians were not hunted down. They were tried only if accusations from local provincials were brought against them. But if accused and convicted, then Christians...were killed simply for being Christians.” Therefore, Pliny’s view of Christians was not necessarily persecution but rather Christians were only executed when they were brought before him at trial and confessed; however, pardons were also given to those who denied such charges. Ste. Croix says the recommended course of action “was ‘accusatory’ and not ‘inquisitorial,’” so that it was never the governors themselves but instead private, local accusers (\"delatores\") who brought forth accusations.\n\nPliny's letter is the earliest pagan account to refer to early Christians and provides a key description of Roman administrative process and problems. The correspondence between Pliny and Emperor Trajan shows that the Roman Empire, as a government entity, did not at this time “seek out” Christians for prosecution or persecution. Although Emperor Trajan gave Pliny specific advice about disregarding anonymous accusations, for example, he was deliberate in not establishing any new rules in regards to the Christians. In doing so, Trajan allowed Pliny to try cases according to his discretion.\n\nThe letter supports the existence of the early Christian Church and its rapid growth and speaks to its belief system. It also provides valuable evidence as to the attitudes of the Roman authorities with regard to early Christianity.\n\nNew Testament critic Hermann Detering has questioned the authenticity of Book 10, a position that has not found acceptance within the mainstream scholarly community.\n\nPliny is one of three key Roman authors who refer to early Christians, the other two being Tacitus and Suetonius. These authors refer to events which take place during the reign of various Roman emperors, Suetonius writing about an of Jews because of disturbances instigated by a certain \"Chrestus\" during the reign of Claudius (41 to 54), and also (who reigned from 54 to 68), Tacitus referring to Nero's actions after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, while Pliny writes to Trajan. But the chronological order for the documentation begins with Pliny writing around 111 AD, then Tacitus writing in the \"Annals\" around 115/116 AD and then Suetonius writing in the \"Lives of the Twelve Caesars\" around 122 AD.\n\n"}

Instead of translating the text of the software into a foreign language, as in the process of localization, the textual elements of an application are replaced with an altered version of the original language. \n\nExample:\nThese specific alterations make the original words appear readable, but include the most problematic characteristics of the world's languages: varying length of text or characters, language direction, and so on.\n\nTraditionally, localization of software is independent of the software development process. In a typical scenario, software would be built and tested in one base language (such as English), with any \"localizable\" elements being extracted into external resources. Those resources are handed off to a localization team for translation into different target languages. The problem with this approach is that many subtle software bugs may be found during the process of localization, when it is too late (or more likely, too expensive) to fix them.\n\nThe types of problems that can arise during localization involve differences in how written text appears in different languages. These problems include:\n\n\nIn addition, the localization process may uncover places where an element should be localizable, but is hard coded in a source language. Similarly, there may be elements that were designed to be localized, but should not be (e.g. the element names in an XML or HTML document.) \n\nPseudolocalization is designed to catch these types of bugs during the development cycle, by mechanically replacing \"all\" localizable elements with a pseudo-language that is readable by speakers of the source language, but which contains most of the troublesome elements of other languages and scripts. This is why pseudolocalisation is to be considered an engineering or internationalization tool more than a localization one.\n\nPseudolocalization was introduced at Microsoft during the Windows Vista development cycle. The type of pseudo-language invented for this purpose is called a pseudo locale in Windows parlance. These locales were designed to use character sets and scripts characteristics from one of the three broad classes of foreign languages used by Windows at the time—basic (\"Western\"), mirrored (\"Near-Eastern\"), and CJK (\"Far-Eastern\"). Prior to Vista, each of these three languages had their own separate builds of Windows, with potentially different code bases (and thus, different behaviors and bugs.) The pseudo locales created for each of these language families would produce text that still \"reads\" as English, but is made up of script from another languages. For example, the text string\n\nwould be rendered in the \"basic\" pseudo-locale as\n\nThis process produces translated strings that are longer, include non-ASCII characters, and (in the case of the \"mirrored\" pseudo-locale), are written right-to-left.\n\nNote that the brackets on either side of the text in this example help to spot the following issues:\n\n\nMichael Kaplan (a Microsoft program manager) explains the process of pseudo-localization similar to:\n\nOne of the key features of the pseudolocalization process is that it happens automatically, during the development cycle, as part of a routine build. The process is almost identical to the process used to produce true localized builds, but is done \"before\" a build is tested, much earlier in the development cycle. This leaves time for any bugs that are found to be fixed in the base code, which is much easier than bugs not found until a release date is near.\n\nThe builds that are produced by the pseudolocalization process are tested using the same QA cycle as a non-localized build. Since the pseudo-locales are mimicking English text, they can be tested by an English speaker. Beta version of Windows (7 and 8) have been released with some pseudo-localized strings intact. For these recent version of Windows, the pseudo-localized build is the primary staging build (the one created routinely for testing), and the final English language build is a \"localized\" version of that.\n\nBesides the tools used internally by Microsoft, other internationalization tools now include pseudolocalization options. These tools include Alchemy Catalyst from Alchemy Software Development, SDL Passolo from SDL and Globalyst from g11n. Such tools include pseudo-localization capability, including ability to view rendered Pseudo-localized dialogs and automating the testing process itself. While tools like Globalyst complete the whole process of creating pseudolocalised build and automate the testing, it can also be done by running a custom made pseudolocalization script on the extracted text resources and manually testing it.\n\nThere are a variety of free pseudolocalization resources on the Internet that will create pseudolocalized versions of common localization formats like iOS strings, Android xml, Gettext po, and others. These sites allow developers to upload strings file to a Web site and download the resulting pseudolocalized file.\n\n"}

H. Myers.\n\nRetrocognition has long been held by scientific researchers into psychic phenomena to be untestable, given that, in order to verify that an accurate retrocognitive experience has occurred, it is necessary to consult existing documents and human knowledge, the existence of which permits some contemporary basis of the knowledge to be raised. For instance, if you purport retrocognitive knowledge that \"Winston Churchill killed a parrot\", the only way of verifying that knowledge would be to consult extant sources of Churchill's activities. If it is found that he did, indeed, kill a parrot at one time, it could be said that you \"simply\" obtained contemporary knowledge of this fact (by clairvoyance or telepathy, if needs be, of the relevant documents or someone's knowledge of them), rather than directly perceived – in the manner of retrocognition – any event in Churchill's past. Given this fundamental logical difficulty, there has been very little experimental investigation by parapsychologists of retrocognition. The evidence for retrocognition has, therefore, been limited to naturalistic cases suggestive of the phenomenon.\n\nThe most popularly celebrated case of retrocognition concerns the visions in 1901 of Annie Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain – two scholars and early administrators of British university education for women – as they tried to find their way to Marie Antoinette's private château, the Petit Trianon. Becoming lost on their way, they believed that they instead came unto the Queen's presence itself. They published an account of their experience in 1911 as \"An Adventure\". Moberly and Jourdain described how they had become convinced, over the following weeks, that persons they saw and even spoke to on that occasion – given certain details of dress, accent, topography and architecture – must have been of a presumed \"recollection\" by Marie Antoinette, on 10 August 1792, of her last days at Trianon in 1789. While often considered in popular literature as evidence for retrocognition, the book was immediately dismissed by Eleanor Sidgwick, a leading member of the British Society for Psychical Research, in an article published in its \"Proceedings\", as the product of mutual confabulation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33564134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33564134", "title": "Sa'och language", "text": "Sa'och language\n\nSa'och (, also, \"Sauch\") is an endangered, nearly extinct Pearic language of Cambodia and Thailand spoken only occasionally by a decreasing number of older adults. There are two dialects, one spoken in Veal Renh Village, Prey Nob District, Sihanoukville Province (formerly known as Kampong Som Province), Cambodia and the other in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand. \"Sa'och\" is the Khmer exonym for the people and the language. The Sa'och, however, consider this label, which means \"scarlet fever\" or \"pimply\" in Khmer, pejorative and use the autonym \"Chung\" () to refer to themselves and their language.\n\nSa'och is an Austroasiatic language. Within the Austroasiatic family, Sa'och is a member of the Pearic languages, a subgroup consisting of a handful of dying languages, including Suoy, Pear, Chong and Samre, spoken by small numbers of ethnic minorities living mostly in far western Cambodia and adjacent areas of Thailand. In traditional classifications, the Pearic languages are most closely related to Khmer dialects, but more conservative schemes place the Pearic subfamily on a level equally distant from all the branches of Austroasiatic.\n\nAfter the breakup of the Khmer Empire, the Cambodian central government was weak and neighboring Thailand and Vietnam vied for Cambodian territory. During this time, the Sa'och maintained a semi-autonomous territory centered on Veal Renh in Kampong Saom (modern-day Sihanoukville). According to Sa'och oral history, they prospered along the coast protected by their fortified settlement of Banteay Prey. However, in the 1830s, during the Siamese-Vietnamese War for Cambodia, the Thai army defeated the Sa'och and took many prisoners of war back to Thailand where they were forced to resettle in Kanchanaburi Province along the Thai-Burmese border. This resulted in two disparate communities of Sa'och speakers separated by some 800 km.\n\nThe defeat and dispersal of the Sa'och led to a drastic decline in the use of the language. The Sa'och in Cambodia remained along the coast of Kampong Saom, living in their own villages such as Long Leh. The dialect that continued to evolve in Cambodia survived because the Sa'och were able to stay isolated from Cambodians, even through the colonial era, until the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia when the vast majority were either killed or relocated and forced to live among Khmers.\n\nThe Sa'och in Thailand were first resettled in the Si Sawat District of Kanchanaburi Province in their own villages along the Khwae Yai River. Their dialect evolved in relative isolation in the fertile valley for almost 140 years until construction of the Si Nakharin Dam which, completed in 1980, permanently inundated the valley. In making preparations for the dam, the Thai government again forced the Sa'och to relocate, this time to the gravelly hills above the new reservoir. In their new villages, which were now mixed with Karen, Khmu and Thai, the Sa'och suddenly became minorities resulting in declining language use in favor of Thai. Additionally, young Sa'och are leaving the relatively barren isolated region to find work, causing an additional decline in language use. A paper published in 2009 reported that use of the Chung language in Thailand was only found among older generations remaining in the village and a few small children left in their care.\n\nBoth groups of Sa'och call their language simply \"chung\". To differentiate the two dialects, researches have arbitrarily designated the dialect found in Cambodia \"Chung Yul\" and that of Thailand \"Chung Yuy\", \"yul\" and \"yuy\" being their respective words for \"sky\".\n\nSa'och employs a phonemic inventory typical of modern Mon-Khmer languages and, along with the other Pearic languages, shows some phonological influences from the late Middle Khmer of the 17th century. Like most of the other Austoasiatic languages (outside of Viet-Muong) Sa'och is not a tonal language. However, also similar to the other Pearic languages, Sa'och is marked by an unusual four-way contrast of vocal register, or phonation, in its vowel system.\n\nSa'och has 21 consonant phonemes. They are listed in table form below.\n\nSa'och contrasts nine vowel qualities which can be either short or long, yielding a total of 18 vowel phonemes. Diphthongs do not occur in native Sa'och words, but the diphthongs , , and may be found in loan words from Thai and Khmer. The vowels of Sa'och are:\n\nSimilar to other modern and historical Austroasiatic languages such as Middle Khmer, western dialects of Khmu, and the Monic and Katuic languages, Sa'och employs a system of phonemic register in which words contrast according to their phonation, or voice quality. However, unlike these languages, which mostly display a two-way contrast (e.g. between clear and breathy voice), Sa'och and other Pearic languages contrast four different voice qualities.\n\nIn a tonal language, an entire syllable carries the tone but in \"register\" languages, phonation is manifested only on the vowels. The four voice qualities in Sa'och and their transcriptions, using the base vowel /aː/ as an example, are clear voice (/a/), creaky voice (/aːˀ/), breathy voice (/a̤ː/) and breathy-creaky voice (a̤ːˀ).\n\n"}

{"id": "34030780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34030780", "title": "Shifting (syntax)", "text": "Shifting (syntax)\n\nIn syntax, shifting occurs when two or more constituents appearing on the same side of their common head exchange positions in a sense to obtain non-canonical order. The most widely acknowledged type of shifting is heavy NP shift, but shifting involving a heavy NP is just one manifestation of the shifting mechanism. Shifting occurs in most if not all European languages, and it may in fact be possible in all natural languages. Shifting is not inversion, and inversion is not shifting, but the two mechanisms are similar insofar as they are both present in languages like English that have relatively strict word order. The theoretical analysis of shifting varies in part depending on the theory of sentence structure that one adopts. If one assumes relatively flat structures, shifting does not result in a discontinuity. Shifting is often motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved. The weight of a constituent is determined by a number of factors: number of words, contrastive focus, semantic content, etc.\n\nShifting is illustrated with the following pairs of sentences. The first sentence of each pair shows what can be considered canonical order, whereas the second gives an alternative order that results from shifting:\n\nThe first sentence with canonical order, where the object noun phrase (NP) precedes the oblique prepositional phrase (PP), is marginal due to the relative 'heaviness' of the NP compared to the PP. The second sentence, which shows shifting, is better because it has the lighter PP preceding the much heavier NP. The following examples illustrate shifting with particle verbs: \n\nWhen the object of the particle verb is a pronoun, the pronoun must precede the particle, whereas when the object is an NP, the particle can precede the NP. Each of the two constituents involved is said to shift, whereby this shifting is motivated by the weight of the two relative to each other. In English verb phrases, heavier constituents tend to follow lighter constituents. The following examples illustrate shifting using pronouns, clauses, and PPs:\n\nWhen the pronoun appears, it is much lighter than the PP, so it precedes the PP. But if the full clause appears, it is heavier than the PP and can therefore follow it.\n\nThe syntactic category of the constituents involved in shifting is not limited; they can even be of the same type, e.g.\n\nIn the first pair, the shifted constituents are PPs, and in the second pair, the shifted constituents are NPs. The second pair illustrates again that shifting is often motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved; the NP \"anyone who used Wikipedia\" is heavier than the NP \"a cheater\".\n\nThe examples so far have shifting occurring in verb phrases. Shifting is not restricted to verb phrases. It can also occur, for instance, in NPs:\n\nThese examples again illustrate shifting that is motivated by the relative weight of the constituents involved. The heavier of the two constituents prefers to appear further to the right. \n\nThe example sentences above all have the shifted constituents appearing after their head (see below). Constituents that precede their head can also shift, e.g.\n\nSince the finite verb is viewed as the head of the clause in each case, these data allow an analysis in terms of shifting. The subject and modal adverb have swapped positions. In other languages that have many head-final structures, shifting in the pre-head domain is a common occurrence.\n\nIf one assumes relatively flat structures, the analysis of many canonical instances of shifting is straightforward. Shifting occurs among two or more sister constituents that appear on the same side of their head. The following trees illustrate the basic shifting constellation in a \"phrase structure grammar\" (= constituency grammar) first and in a dependency grammar second: \n\nThe two constituency-based trees show a flat VP that allows n-ary branching (as opposed to just binary branching). The two dependency-based trees show the same VP. Regardless of whether one chooses the constituency- or the dependency-based analysis, the important thing about these examples is the relative flatness of the structure. This flatness results in a situation where shifting does not necessitate a discontinuity (i.e. no long distance dependency), for there can be no crossing lines in the trees. The following trees further illustrate the point:\n\nAgain due to the flatness of structure, shifting does not result in a discontinuity. In this example, both orders are acceptable because there is little difference in the relative weight between the two constituents that switch positions.\n\nAn alternative analysis of shifting is necessary in a constituency grammar that posits strictly binary branching structures. The more layered binary branching structures would result in crossing lines in the tree, which means movement (or copying) is necessary to avoid these crossing lines. The following trees are (merely) representative of the type of analysis that one might assume given strictly binary branching structures:\n\nThe analysis shown with the trees assumes binary branching and leftward movement only. Given these restrictions, two instances of movement might be necessary to accommodate the surface order seen in tree b. The material in light gray represents copies that must be deleted in the phonological component. \nThis sort of analysis of shifting has been criticized by Ray Jackendoff, among others. Jackendoff and Culicover argue for an analysis like that shown with the flatter trees above, whereby heavy NP shift does not result from movement, but rather from a degree of optionality in the ordering of a verb's complements. The preferred order in English is for the direct object to follow the indirect object in a double-object construction, and for adjuncts to follow objects of all kinds; but if the direct object is \"heavy\", the opposite order may be preferred (since this leads to a more right-branching tree structure which is easier to process).\n\nFrom a generativist's perspective, a \"mysterious\" property of shifting is that in the case of ditransitive verbs, a shifted direct object prevents extraction of the indirect object via wh-movement:\n\nSome generativists use this example to argue against the hypothesis that shifting merely results from choice between alternative complement orders, a hypothesis that does not imply movement. Their analysis in terms of a strictly binary branching tree resulting from leftward movements would in turn be able to explain this restriction. However, there are at least two ways of countering this argument: 1) in case one wants to explain choice, if choice is assumed to be performed between possible orders, the impossible order is not in the linguistic potential and it cannot be chosen; however, 2) in case one wants to explain generation, that is, to explain how a linguistic potential comes to exist in a situation, one can explain this phenomenon in terms of generation and avoidance rules: for instance, one of the reasons for avoiding a wording in potentiality would be an ordering in which a preposition falls before a nominal group by accident as in the example above. In other words, from a functional perspective, we either recognise that these fake clauses are none of the clauses we can choose from (choice of possible clauses) or we say that they are generated and avoided because they might cause listeners to misunderstand what the speaker is saying (generation and avoidance).\n\n"}

{"id": "26110119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26110119", "title": "Uyghur grammar", "text": "Uyghur grammar\n\nUyghur is a Turkic language spoken mostly in the west of China.\n\nUyghur exhibits the agglutination characteristic to the Turkic family, and its basic word order is subject-object-verb. It lacks grammatical gender and does not use articles. The language's inventory of 24 consonants and eight vowels features both vowel harmony and consonant harmony. Nouns are marked for ten cases, in general with suffixes, and are additionally inflected for number.\n\nThis article uses both the Arabic script (official for the language) and Latin script for Uyghur words.\n\nThe typical word order in Uyghur is subject–object–verb (SOV), as in the sentence \"men\nuyghurche oquymen\", lit., \"I Uyghur study.\" Compare this to English, where the sentence would be expressed with subject–verb–object order: \"I study Uyghur\".\n\nUyghur is an agglutinative language, meaning that potentially many suffixes (denoting person, number, case, mood, etc.) are usually all attached to one word stem. For example \"to your house,\" the main word, house, occurs first, and the modifying elements are attached directly to the right and written all in one word: öyingizge (öy-ingiz-ge, lit. \"home-your-to\"), and \"having worked\" ishlewatqan (ishle-wat-qan) \"work-ing-INDEFINITE.PAST.\"\n\nNouns are not distinguished for gender (e.g. male, female), unlike in such languages as Spanish, French, and German. Nouns are usually pluralized (with the suffix +lAr) except when preceded by a numeral: compare \"atlar\" (\"horses\") and \"ikki at\" (two horses). Instead of using articles (like English \"a\", \"the\"), Uyghur uses demonstrative pronouns (\"this\", \"that\") and no marker or the numeral one (bir) to indicate definiteness and indefiniteness, respectively, e.g. bu müshük \"this cat/the cat\" vs. bir müshük \"a/one cat\" or müshük \"cat/cats.\"\n\nUyghur verbs take different suffixes, usually at least for tense (present, past) and person (I, you, s/he, they, etc.), for example oqu-y-men, lit. read-PRESENT.FUTURE-I, meaning \"I read/study.\" Uyghur verbs can also take other suffixes to mark voice (causative, passive), aspect (continuous), mood (e.g. ability), as well as suffixes that change verbs into nouns—sometimes many all together: oqu-wat-qan-im-da, lit. read-CONTINUOUS-INDEFINITE.P AST-my-at, meaning \"When I was studying...\" Negation usually also appears as a verb suffix, e.g. oqu-ma-y-men lit. read-NEG- PRESENT.FUTURE-I, \"I don’t read.\"\n\nUyghur has vowel and consonant harmony, a system where vowels or consonants in a word come to match or become similar to each other, especially as suffixes and other elements are attached. Many but not all words and grammatical elements in Uyghur behave according to these harmonic principles. If a suffix is written with one or more capital letters (e.g. +DA, +lAr, +GA, etc.), these capital letters indicate that these sounds are harmonic, that is, variable: D= d/t, G= gh/q/g/k; K= k/q; A= a/e; I= i/u/ü or ø/i/u/ü.\n\nThere are 32 basic sounds in Modern Uyghur.\n\nUyghur has 24 consonants (listed here according to the Arabic-script alphabet): b, p, t, j, ch, x, d, r, z, zh, s, sh, gh, f, q, k, g, ng, l, m, n, x, h, w, y (and 25 consonants if the glottal stop ‘ is counted). Most are not pronounced much differently than their English counterparts (e.g. Uyghur j in baj \"tax\" is pronounced like j in judge; Uyghur ch in üch \"three\" is pronounced like ch in itch; Uyghur h in he’e \"yes\" is pronounced like h in hello), except that l has palatal or velar variants. A few sounds are not found in English: q gh and x. The voiceless uvular stop q [qȹ] is pronounced like a back k, with the back of the tongue touching the soft palate, as in aq \"white,\" Qeshqer \"Kashgar.\" The sound gh is typically a voiced fricative version of q, also pronounced at the very back of the mouth, and sounds like French or German r, as in Roissy or Ruhr. (Near front vowels, gh is often pronounced more front, like French Rue or German Rübe.) Finally, the Uyghur voiceless velar or uvular fricative x is pronounced like ch in Scottish loch, or further back in the mouth, like a back version of German ach.\n\nThe four sounds k, g, q, and gh are subject to consonant harmony: (1) within a stem (main word), they potentially determine its backness and (2) within a variable suffix, they conform to the backness and voicing of the preceding stem. Consonant harmony is discussed below.\n\nThe ژ zh (sounds like English garage), is only for foreign and onomatopoeic words like zhurnal ‘magazine, journal’, and pizh-pizh \"sizzling.\" The letter ج j (normally pronounced as in baj ‘tax’) is in southern Xinjiang often pronounced . Initial y can also be pronounced before i, e.g. yilan ‘snake’.\n\nIn Uyghur words of Turkic origin, sh is rare, except as a suffix; similarly, since f was borrowed into Uyghur from Arabic and Persian, it is often replaced by p, especially in colloquial and rural usage: fakultët~pakultët ‘academic department’.\n\nUyghur has eight vowels. Vowels are rounded (o, u, ü, ö) and unrounded (a, i, e, ë); this distinction is sometimes termed labial vs. non-labial; they are front (ü, ö, e) or back (u, o, a). These distinctions are critical for harmonic purposes, since Uyghur words are subject to vowel harmony.The orthographic vowel i represents both a front [i] and a back [ɨ], and is not subject to vowel harmony.\n\nUyghur accent (stress or high pitch, which we will for convenience call stress) is not well understood, yet some general remarks can be made to aid language learning. In Uyghur, stress is mostly determined by the length of syllables. This means that a syllable which is closed (i.e., ends in consonants [CVC or CVCC]) tends to attract stress, while a syllable which is open (i.e. ends in a vowel [CV]) does not. A general rule of thumb is: stress the last syllable of the stem, e.g. ayagh \"foot,\" Turpan'gha \"to Turfan.\" (in the vocabulary lists, we underline stressed syllables.)\n\nWord-internal harmony is relatively weak in Uyghur, but when suffixes are added to a word stem, certain suffix vowels and consonants harmonize with those of the stem. There are two variable vowels in Uyghur, A (a/e) and I (i/u/ü). There is one harmonically variable consonant type: G (k/g/q/gh). Uyghur’s harmony system has three relevant components: voicing, backness, and roundness harmony.\n\nNouns in Uyghur have no grammatical gender or definite marking, although the number 'one' \"bir\" can be used to mark indefiniteness. Plurals are marked by \"-lar\" or \"-ler\", with the vowel following the rules of vowel harmony.\n\nUyghur has ten cases, all of which except the nominative are marked by suffixation after possible plural or possessive suffixes.\n\nIn Uyghur there is one set of personal pronouns used for the first- and third person, while there are three in the second person. The use of the three sets in the second person depends on the formality and politeness.\n\nThe personal pronouns are inflected for number and case. Follow the links of each of the personal pronouns to see them inflected.\n\nThe second person personal pronoun mostly used among people is the polite سىز \"siz\", while the informal سەن \"sen\" is used between very close friends, or when parents are addressing their children. The informal سەن \"sen\" is also used when the speaker has a higher social rank than the addressed person.\n\nThe respectful سىلى \"sili\" is used for addressing respectul elders, grandparents or other notable persons of a community. Royalty is also addressed using سىلى \"sili\", and sometimes even customers in stores.\n\nUyghur has several demonstrative pronouns with some of them being used for emphasis or as intensifiers, while others have less specific uses. Common for all of the demonstrative pronouns is that their use depends on the distance between the speaker and the thing or person to which is referred.\n\nThe demonstrative pronouns are inflected for number and case. In the table below, the demonstrative pronouns can be seen, although only in the singular. Follow the links of each of the demonstrative pronouns to see them inflected.\n\nThe most common demonstrative pronouns are بۇ \"bu\", ئۇ \"u\" and شۇ \"shu\", the first being translated as \"this\" and the remaining two as \"that\". The first is used when referring to an object or person which is visible and close to the speaker, the second is used when referring to an object or person which is away from the speaker and the third is used when referring to a previously mentioned object or person which is not particular close to the speaker in an affirmative statement.\n\nThe two first-mentioned demonstrative persons each have an intensified derived form ending in ۋۇ \"-wu\", ماۋۇ \"mawu\" and ئاۋۇ \"awu\", respectively. These are used when it is necessary to make it clear that the object or person the demonstrative pronoun is referring to really is the object or person which the speaker means. The two first-mentioned demonstrative persons both also have another derived form, ending in شۇ \"-shu\", مۇشۇ \"mushu\" and ئاشۇ \"ashu\", respectively. These are often used for confirming something the speaker is already familiar with.\n\nThe examples below illustrate the use of بۇ \"bu\" and its derived forms.\n\n"}
{"id": "669120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=669120", "title": "Visual communication", "text": "Visual communication\n\nVisual communication is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be seen. Visual communication in part or whole relies on eyesight. Visual communication is a broad spectrum that includes signs, typography, drawing, graphic design, illustration, industrial design, advertising, animation, color, and electronic resources.\n\nThe evaluation of a good visual communication design is mainly based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on personal aesthetic and/or artistic preference as there are no universally agreed-upon principles of aesthetics. Besides two dimensional images, there are other ways to express information visually - gestures and body language, animation (digital or analogue), and film. Visual communication by e-mail, a textual medium, is commonly expressed with ASCII art, emoticons, and embedded digital images.\n\nThe term 'visual presentation' is used to refer to the actual presentation of information through a visible medium such as text or images. Recent research in the field has focused on web design and graphically-oriented usability. Graphic designers also use methods of visual communication in their professional practice. Visual communication on the World Wide Web is perhaps the most important form of communication that takes place while users are surfing the Internet. When experiencing the web, one uses the eyes as the primary sense, and therefore the visual presentation of a website is very important for users to understand the message or of the communication taking place.The Eye of Horus is often referred to as the symbol of visual communication. It is said to be a representation of an eclipse, as the cornea around the pupil is like the cornea around the sun during a solar eclipse.\n\nAldous Huxley is highly regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories. Becoming near-blind in his teen years as the result of an illness set the stage for what would make him one of the most intellectual people to have ever explored visual communication. His work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously \"Brave New World\" and \"The Art of Seeing\". He described \"seeing\" as being the sum of sensing, selecting, and perceiving. One of his most famous quotes is \"The more you see, the more you know.\"\n\nMax Wertheimer is said to be the father of Gestalt psychology. Gestalt means \"form\" or \"shape\" in German, and the study of Gestalt psychology show emphasis in simplicity, as its properties group visuals by similarity in shape or color and proximity. Looking for continuation, closure, and figure-ground principles in studied images is also intensively taught.\n\nStudents studying visual communication are taught the basic physics of light, anatomy and physiology of the eye, cognitive and perception theories, colour theories, Gestalt psychology, aesthetics, natural reading patterns, design principles, semiotics, persuasion, camera/filming actions and image-types, and so forth. Colleges for visual communications differ in their approach, but most combine theory and practice in some form.\n\nVisual communication takes place through pictures, graphs and charts, as well as through signs, signals and symbols. It may be used either independently or as an adjunct to the other methods of communication.\n\nVisual communication contains image aspects. The interpretation of images is subjective and to understand the depth of meaning, or multiple meanings, communicated in an image requires analysis. Images can be analysed though many perspectives, for example these six major perspectives presented by Paul Martin Lester:\n\nWhen a viewer has an opinion about an image based on their personal thoughts. Personal response depends on the viewer’s thoughts and values individually. This might be sometimes in conflict with cultural values. Also when a viewer has viewed an image with a personal perspective, it is hard to change the view of the image on the viewer, and the image can even be seen in other ways.\n\nAn image’s view can be arising from the history of the use media. Through times sort images have been changed, because the use of different (new) media. For example: The result of using the computer to edit images (e.g. Photoshop) is quite different when comparing images that are made and edited by craft.\n\nWhen the view of an image is influenced by the use of lights, position and the presentation of the image. The right use of light, position and presentation of the image can improve the view of the image. It makes the image looks better than the reality.\n\nFrom this perspective, the maker of the image, the viewer and the image itself must be responsible morally and ethically to the image. This perspective is also categorized in six categories: categorical imperative, utilitarianism, hedonism, golden mean, golden rule and veil of ignorance.\n\nSymbolization is an important definition for this perspective. Cultural perspective involves identity of symbols. The uses of words that are related with the image, the use of heroes in the image, etc. are the symbolization of the image. The cultural perspective can also be seen as the semiotic perspective.\n\nThe view of images in the critical perspective is when the viewers criticise the images, but the critics have been made in interests of the society, although an individual makes the critics. This way this perspective differs from the personal perspective.\n\nVisual aids are often used to help audiences of informative and persuasive speeches understand the topic being presented. Visual aids can play a large role in how the audience understands and takes in information that is presented. There are many different types of visual aids that range from handouts to PowerPoints. The type of visual aid a speaker uses depends on their preference and the information they are trying to present. Each type of visual aid has pros and cons that must be evaluated to ensure it will be beneficial to the overall presentation. Before incorporating visual aids into speeches, the speaker should understand that if used incorrectly, the visual will not be an aid, but a distraction. Planning ahead is important when using visual aids. It is necessary to choose a visual aid that is appropriate for the material and audience. The purpose of the visual aid is to \"enhance\" the presentation.\n\nObjects\n\nModels\n\nGraphs\n\nMaps\n\nTables\n\nPhotographs\n\nDrawings or diagrams\n\nChalkboards and whiteboards are very useful visual aids, particularly when more advanced types of media are unavailable. They are cheap and also allow for much flexibility.\nThe use of chalkboards or whiteboards is convenient, but they are not a perfect visual aid. Often, using this medium as an aid can create confusion or boredom. Particularly if a student who is not familiar with how to properly use visual aids attempts to draw on a board while they are speaking, they detract time and attention from their actual speech.\n\nA poster is a very simple and easy visual aid. Posters can display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations. The biggest drawback of using a poster as a visual aid is that often a poster can appear unprofessional. Since a poster board paper is relatively flimsy, often the paper will bend or fall over. The best way to present a poster is to hang it up or tape it to a wall.\n\nHandouts can also display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations. An important aspect of the use of a handout is that a person can keep a handout with them long after the presentation is over. This can help the person better remember what was discussed. Passing out handouts, however, can be extremely distracting. Once a handout is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience’s attention. The person who receives the handout might be tempted to read what is on the paper, which will keep them from listening to what the speaker is saying. If using a handout, the speaker distributes the hand out right before you reference it. Distributing handouts is acceptable in a lecture that is an hour or two, but in a short lecture of five to ten minutes, a handout should not be used.\n\nA video can be a great visual aid and attention grabber, however, a video is not a replacement for an actual speech. There are several potential drawbacks to playing a video during a speech or lecture. First, if a video is playing that includes audio, the speaker will not be able to talk. Also, if the video is very exciting and interesting, it can make what the speaker is saying appear boring and uninteresting. The key to showing a video during a presentation is to make sure to transition smoothly into the video and to only show very short clips.\n\nThere are several types of projectors. These include slide projectors, PowerPoint presentations, overhead projectors, and computer projectors. Slide projectors are the oldest form of projector, and are no longer used. PowerPoint presentations are very popular and are used often. Overhead projectors are still used but are somewhat inconvenient to use. In order to use an overhead projector, a transparency must be made of whatever is being projected onto the screen. This takes time and costs money. Computer projectors are the most technologically advanced projectors. When using a computer projector, pictures and slides are easily taken right from a computer either online or from a saved file and are blown up and shown on a large screen. Though computer projectors are technologically advanced, they are not always completely reliable because technological breakdowns are not uncommon of the computers of today.\n\nPowerPoint presentations can be an extremely useful visual aid, especially for longer presentations. For five- to ten-minute presentations, it is probably not worth the time or effort to put together a PowerPoint. For longer presentations, however, PowerPoints can be a great way to keep the audience engaged and keep the speaker on track. A potential drawback of using a PowerPoint is that it usually takes a lot of time and energy to put together. There is also the possibility of a computer malfunction, which can mess up the flow of a presentation.\n\nSocial media is one of the most effective ways to communicate. The incorporation of text and images deliver messages quicker and more simplistic through social media platforms. A potential drawback can be there is limited access due to the internet access requirement and certain limitations to the number of characters and image size.\n"}

Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered instrumental music (e.g. the wordless women's choir in the final movement of Holst's The Planets) as is music without singing. Music without any non-vocal instrumental accompaniment is referred to as \"a cappella\".\n\nVocal music typically features sung words called lyrics, although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables, sounds, or noises, sometimes as musical onomatopoeia. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a song.\n\nVocal music is probably the oldest form of music, since it does not require any instrument besides the human voice. All musical cultures have some form of vocal music.\n\n\nSolfege, a vocalized musical scale, assigns various syllables such as ‘‘Do-Re-Mi‘‘ to each note.

{"id": "11451063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11451063", "title": "Wildlife corridor", "text": "Wildlife corridor\n\nA wildlife corridor, habitat corridor, or green corridor is an area of habitat connecting wildlife populations separated by human activities or structures (such as roads, development, or logging). This allows an exchange of individuals between populations, which may help prevent the negative effects of inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity (via genetic drift) that often occur within isolated populations. Corridors may also help facilitate the re-establishment of populations that have been reduced or eliminated due to random events (such as fires or disease).\n\nThis may potentially moderate some of the worst effects of habitat fragmentation, wherein urbanization can split up habitat areas, causing animals to lose both their natural habitat and the ability to move between regions to use all of the resources they need to survive. Habitat fragmentation due to human development is an ever-increasing threat to biodiversity, and habitat corridors are a possible mitigation.\n\nThe main goal of implementing habitat corridors is to increase biodiversity. When areas of land are broken up by human interference, population numbers become unstable and many animal and plant species become endangered. By re-connecting the fragments, the population fluctuations can decrease dramatically. Corridors can contribute to three factors that stabilize a population: \n\nRosenberg et.al. (1995) were among the first to define what constitutes a wildlife corridor. The definitions of \"biological corridor\" (i.e., wildlife corridor) had, in the early years of studying corridors, been \"vague and inconsistent, and often they confound form and function\" Rosenberg et.al. developed a conceptual model that emphasized the role of a wildlife corridor as a facilitator of movement that is not restricted by requirements of native vegetation or intermediate target patches of habitat. Their definition simply required that movement to a target patch via the corridor be greater that if the corridor were absent.\n\nAlthough corridors had originally been implemented with the assumption that they would increase biodiversity, not enough research had been done to come to a solid conclusion. The case for corridors has been built more on intuition and much less on empirical evidence (Tewksbury et al. 2002). Tewksbury et. al. claimed that the early controversies had arisen because most studies had been limited in that they had a narrow taxonomic focus and, that if corridors facilitate animal movement, they should also have strong indirect effects on plant populations due to increased pollen and seed by animals. Results of their 2002 experiment provided a large-scale experimental demonstration that habitat (or wildlife) corridors facilitate movement of disparate taxa between otherwise isolated patches even after controlling for area effects (Tewksbury et al, 2002). Another factor that needs to be taken into account is what species the corridor is intended for. Some species have reacted more positively to corridors than others.\n\nA habitat corridor could be considered as a possible solution in an area where the destruction of a natural area has greatly affected its native species. Development such as roads, buildings, and farms can interrupt plants and animals in the region being destroyed. Furthermore, natural disasters such as wildfires and floods can leave animals with no choice but to evacuate. If the habitat is not connected to a safer one, it will ultimately lead to death. A remaining portion of natural habitat is called a remnant, and such portions need to be connected because when migration decreases, extinction increases (Fleury 1997).\n\nCorridors can be made in two distinct areas—either water or land. Water corridors are called riparian ribbons and usually come in the form of rivers and streams. Land corridors come on a scale as large as wooded strips connecting larger woodland areas. However, they can also be as simple as a line of shrubs along a sidewalk (Fleury 1997). Such areas can facilitate the movement of small animals, especially birds, from tree to tree, until they find a safe habitat to nest in. Not only do minimal corridors aid in the movement of animals, they are also aesthetically pleasing, which can sometimes encourage the community to accept and support them.\n\nSpecies can be categorized in one of two groups; passage users and corridor dwellers.\n\nPassage users occupy corridors for brief periods of time. These animals use corridors for such events as seasonal migration, dispersal of a juvenile, or moving between parts of a large home range. Usually large herbivores, medium to large carnivores, and migratory species are passage users (Beier & Loe 1992). One common misconception is that the corridor only needs to be wide enough for the passage users to get through. However, the corridor still must be wide enough to be safe and also encourage the animals to use it, even though they do not live out their entire lives in it.\n\nCorridor dwellers can occupy the passage anywhere from several days to several years. Species such as plants, reptiles, amphibians, birds, insects, and small mammals can spend their entire lives in linear habitats. In this case, the corridor must include everything that a species needs to live and breed, such as soil for germination, burrowing areas, and multiple other breeding adults (Beier & Loe 1992).\n\nHabitat corridors can be categorized according to their width. Typically the wider the corridor, the more use it will get from species. However, the width-length ratio, as well as design and quality play just as important of a role in creating the perfect corridor (Fleury 1997). The strip of land will suffer less from edge effects such as weeds, predators, and chemicals if it is constructed properly. The following are three divisions in corridor widths: \n\nHabitat corridors can also be divided according to their continuity. Continuous corridors are strips that are not broken up, while “stepping stone” corridors are small patches of suitable habitat. When stepping stones are arranged in a line, they form a strip of land connecting two areas, just like a continuous corridor would. Both kinds provide linkages between protected core areas and stimulate or allow species to migrate.\n\nFinally, corridors can come in the form of underpasses or overpasses, which can be very safe for both animals and humans. Many busy highways cross through natural habitats that native species occupy, as well. Large animals such as deer become a hazard when they cross in front of traffic and get hit. An overpass or an underpass serves as a bridge to facilitate the movement of animals across a busy road. Observations have shown that underpasses are actually more successful than overpasses because many times animals are too timid to cross over a bridge in front of traffic and would prefer to be more hidden (Dole et al. 2003).\nCorridors can be expensive to plan out and put into action. For example, Daniel Simberloff et al. states that “a bridge that would maintain a riparian corridor costs about 13 times as much per lane-mile as would a road that would sever the corridor.” He also states that maintenance of a corridor would be much more costly than refuges for endangered species. It would simply be easier to move animals between refuges than to buy land, install a corridor, and maintain it. However, where the goal is not just to preserve a few large animal species but to protect biodiversity among all plants and animals, then habitat corridors may be the only option. Corridors are going to be expensive to implement no matter what, but it does depend on the type, location, and size, which can all vary to a great degree. With the lack of field data on the effectiveness, many agencies are not willing to consider putting in corridors.\n\nIt is extremely important for researchers to pay attention to the population changes in animals after a corridor has been implemented to ensure that there are no harmful effects. Researchers can use both mark-recapture techniques and evaluate genetic flow in order to observe how much a corridor is being used. Marking and recapturing animals is more useful when keeping a close eye on individual movement (Mech & Hallet 2001). The only problem is that tagging animals and watching them does not tell anyone whether the migrating individuals are successfully mating with other populations in connected areas of land. On the other hand, genetic techniques can be more effective in evaluating migration and mating patterns.\n\nOne of the most important goals of developing a corridor is to increase migration in certain animal species. By looking at a population’s gene flow, researchers can understand the genetic consequences of corridors (Mech & Hallett 2001). The migration patterns of an entire population are much more important than the movements of a few individuals. From these techniques, researchers will better understand whether or not habitat corridors are increasing biodiversity.\n\nStephen Mech and James Hallett introduce an additional reason genetic techniques are more useful; they “measure average migration rates over time, which reveals the effects of fragmentation of several generations and is not as sensitive to current population sizes as mark-recapture studies are.” For example, when a population is extremely small, mark-recapture is almost impossible. Clearly, genetic analysis of a species is the best way to determine if animals are actually using corridors to move and reproduce.\n\nAccording to new research, wildlife corridors are best built with a certain degree of randomness or asymmetry, rather than built symmetrically. The research was conducted at UC Davis.\n\nWildlife corridors are susceptible to edge effects; habitat quality along the edge of a habitat fragment is often much lower than in core habitat areas. Wildlife corridors are important for large species requiring significant sized ranges; however, they are also vital as connection corridors for smaller animals and plants as well as ecological connectors to provide a \"rescue effect\".\n\nBoth the safety of animals and humans can be achieved through the creation of corridors. For example, deer commonly cross roads in order to get to other grazing land. When they are faced with a car coming at them, they freeze; this puts both the deer and the human’s life in danger. In Alberta, Canada, an overpass was constructed to keep animals off of the busy highway; the area is part of a national park, so many different creatures roam the area. The top of the bridge is covered in the native grass of the area so that it blends in better and animals will not know the difference. Gates were also put of on either side of the overpass to help guide animals in the right direction (Semrad 2007).\n\nIn Southern California, 15 underpasses and drainage culverts were observed to see how many animals used them as corridors. They proved to be especially effective on wide-ranging species such as carnivores, mule deer, small mammals, and reptiles, even though the corridors were not intended specifically for animals. Researchers also learned that factors such as surrounding habitat, underpass dimensions, and human activity also played a role in how much use they got. From this experiment, much was learned about what would constitute a successful habitat corridor (Dole et al. 2003).\n\nIn South Carolina, five remnant areas of land were monitored; one was put in the center and four were surrounding it. Then, a corridor was put between one of the remnants and the center. Butterflies that were placed in the center habitat were two to four times more likely to move to the connected remnant rather than the disconnected ones. Furthermore, male holly plants were placed in the center region, and female holly plants in the connected region increased by 70 percent in seed production compared to those plants in the disconnected region. The most impressive dispersal into the connected region, though, was through bird droppings. Far more plant seeds were dispersed through bird droppings in the corridor-connected patch of land (M. 2002).\n\nThere have also been positive effects on the rates of transfer and interbreeding in vole populations. A control population in which voles were confined to their core habitat with no corridor was compared to a treatment population in their core habitat with passages that they could use to move to other regions. Females typically stayed and mated within their founder population, but the rate of transfer through corridors in the males was very high. Researchers are not sure why the females did not move about as much, but it is apparent that the corridor effectively transferred at least some of the species to another location for breeding (Aars 1999).\n\nIn 2001, a wolf corridor was restored through a golf course in Jasper National Park, Alberta, which enabled wolves to pass through the course. After this restoration, wolves passed through the corridor frequently. This is one of the first demonstrations that corridors are used by wildlife, and can be effective in decreasing fragmentation. Earlier studies had been criticised for failing to demonstrate that corridor restoration leads to a change in wildlife behaviour.\nElephant corridors are narrow strips of land that allow elephants to move from one habitat patch to another. There are 88 identified elephant corridors in India.\n\nIn Africa, Botswana houses the largest number of free-roaming elephant herds. Elephants Without Borders (EWB) studies the movement of elephants is working to gain community support of local community corridors, so that elephants and humans can co-exist.\n\nSeveral artificial wildlife corridors have been created, these include:\n\nSome animal species are much more apt to use habitat corridors than others depending on what their migration and mating patterns are like. For example, many cases of birds and butterflies successfully using corridors have been observed. Less successful stories have come out of mammals such as deer. How effective a corridor is may simply rely on what species it is directed towards (Tewskbury 2002). Corridors created with birds in mind may be more successful because they are highly migratory to begin with.\n\nHuman interference is almost inevitable with the quickly increasing population. The goal behind habitat corridors shows the most hope for solving habitat fragmentation and restoring biodiversity as much as possible. Although there are many positives and negatives, there may be enough positives to continue studying and improving corridors. It is truly difficult to say whether corridors are the solution to increasing biodiversity, because each one must be judged on its own. Each corridor has its own set of standards and goals that may set it apart from another one.\n\nA major downfall to habitat corridors is that not much information has been gathered about their success. Due to the lack of positive data, many agencies will not allow corridors to be established because they are unsure of their effectiveness. Another problem with corridors is that they are not as useful as simply preserving land so that it cannot be fragmented. However, it is becoming very difficult to set aside land for nature reserves when road-building, industry, and urban sprawl are all competing for space.\n\nEven if corridors are sought as a solution, it does not necessarily mean that animals will use them. Especially in the case of overpasses, research shows that animals do not like to use them to get to another remnant area of land. Usually overpasses are built over busy highways, and many species are too timid to expose themselves in front of all of the traffic. As more roads and buildings arise, there becomes less space to try to preserve.\n\nHabitat corridors need to be species-specific (not every kind of animal will use every kind of corridor) and corridors can be barriers to some species. For instance plants may use road verges as corridors however some mammals will not cross roads to reach a suitable habitat.\n\nWhen a corridor is implemented, many times development is so close by, that it becomes difficult to build a wide enough passage. There is usually a very limited amount of space available for corridors, so buffers are not usually added in (Rosenberg 1997). Without a buffer zone, corridors become susceptible to harmful outside factors from city streets, suburb development, rural homes, forestry, cropland, and feedlots.\n\nUnfortunately, another limiting factor to the implementation of corridors is money. With such inconclusive data about the effectiveness of connecting land, it is difficult to get the proper funding. Those who would be in charge of the corridor design and construction would ask such questions as, “What if the corridors affect species negatively?” and “What if they actually aid in the spread of disease and catastrophic events?” Furthermore, there is a possibility that corridors could not only aid in the dispersal of native organisms, but invasive ones, as well (Beier & Loe 1998). If invasive species take over an area they could potentially threaten another species, even to the point of extinction.\n\nAlthough wildlife corridors have been proposed as solutions to habitat and wildlife population fragmentation, there is little evidence that they are broadly useful as a conservation strategy for all biodiversity in non-developed or less-developed areas, compared to protecting connectivity as the relevant ecological attribute. In other words, corridors may be a useful meme for conservation planning/ers, but the concept has less meaning to wildlife species themselves. Very few wildlife follow easily identified \"corridors\" or \"linkages\" (e.g., using computer modeling), instead most species meander and opportunistically move through landscapes during daily, seasonal, and dispersal movement behavior. Wildlife corridors may be useful in highly developed landscapes where they are easily identified as the last remaining and available habitat.\n\nHabitat corridors may be defenseless against a number of outside influences, but they are still an efficient way of increasing biodiversity. Strips of land aid in the movement of various animal species and pollen and seed dispersal, which is an added benefit to the intended one (M. 2002). For example, when insects carrying pollen or birds carrying seeds travel to another area, plant species effectively get transported, as well.\n\nAnother positive aspect of corridors is that they allow both animals and humans to occupy virtually the same areas of land, and thus co-exist where without the corridor this would not be possible. Large animals such as bears can be attracted to residential areas in search of food due to lack of natural resources because of habitat fragmentation. A corridor would provide a passage for the bears to forage in other locations, so that they would not pose as much of a threat to humans.\n\n\n\n"}
