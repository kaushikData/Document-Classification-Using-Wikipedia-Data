The reasons for this may include punishment for a team found guilty of a certain act in the past, stadium safety issues or to prevent potentially dangerous clashes between rival supporters. It is predicated by articles 7, 12 and 24 of FIFA's disciplinary code.\n\nAfter rioting by fans in the first leg against Castilla in Spain, West Ham United were forced to play the second leg at Upton Park in October 1980 to an empty stadium.\n\nAfter rioting by fans in a semi-final at Anderlecht in Belgium the previous April, Aston Villa were forced to begin their defence of the European Cup at an empty Villa Park in September 1982, with the match kicking off at 2.30 pm on a Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAs a result of a policeman being killed during rioting at a Serie A match between Catania and Palermo on 2 February, the Italian Football Federation suspended all Italian matches indefinitely. Subsequently, matches resumed but many clubs were ordered to play their games behind closed doors until their stadiums met with updated security regulations.\n\nJuventus were ordered to play a home game behind closed doors after their fans had racially abused Internazionale striker Mario Balotelli during a 1-1 Serie A draw in April 2009.\n\nFC Dinamo Bucureşti had to play two home games in European competitions behind closed doors after their match against FC Slovan Liberec on 25 August 2009 was abandoned in the 88th minute due to a pitch invasion by Dinamo fans.\n\nDuring the penultimate round of league games all teams had to play with closed doors due to the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in infected cities. Several games taking place in areas which were badly affected by the outbreak were also played behind closed doors the following week. Games behind closed doors have been played regularly as a penalty for bad behavior of fans in Mexico, most recently an Apertura 2015 game in which Atlas hosted Querétaro at Estadio Jalisco because of last season quarterfinal game in which Atlas fans invaded the pitch against their hated rivals Guadalajara.\n\nIn rugby union, the 2010–11 Heineken Cup pool stage match between Edinburgh and Castres at Murrayfield was played behind closed doors on 20 December 2010. The match was originally scheduled for 19 December, but was postponed due to heavy snow in Edinburgh that covered the pitch and created major access issues for potential spectators. The competition organiser, European Rugby Cup, decided to hold the rescheduled match behind closed doors to remove any possible danger to spectators attempting to travel to the match.\n\nStarting with the 2011–12 season, the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) instituted a modified version of this rule. The penalty for a team sanctioned for crowd violence is now a ban on both ticket sales to, and attendance by, males over age 12 (as spectators). Women, and children under age 12 of either sex, are admitted free. The first game under the new rule took place on 20 September 2011, when Fenerbahçe hosted Manisaspor at Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul. Over 41,000 women and children attended the match (plus a small number of men who had sneaked into the stadium). The experiment was so successful that the TFF planned to require that teams allocate an unspecified number of free tickets for women and children at all future club matches. Shortly thereafter, the TFF stated that it would reimburse clubs for free tickets given to women and children for regular league games (i.e., games not subject to crowd restrictions), and increased the upper age limit for \"children\" for the purposes of free ticketing to 15.\n\nA match between Eredivisie clubs Ajax and AZ in the fourth round of the 2011–12 KNVB Cup was replayed behind closed doors at Ajax's home ground, Amsterdam Arena, on 19 January 2012. In the original match, held at the same venue on 21 December 2011, Ajax held a 1–0 lead when a fan ran onto the pitch and launched a karate kick from behind against AZ goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado. The player responded by kicking the fan several times before security arrived. When Alvarado was sent off for retaliating against his attacker, AZ left the pitch, and the match was abandoned. The KNVB rescinded the red card, ordered the match replayed in its entirety, Ajax then gave an apology to their AZ Alkmaar opponents. but were nonetheless fined €10,000 for failing to prevent the fan entering the stadium. He was supposed to be serving a 3-year stadium ban, but was pretending that his ban had expired early. Ajax accepted the penalties, and announced that it had extended the fan's stadium ban 10 times more charges to 30 years and given him a long ban from the club and its seasonal ticketing for a total of 800 to 900 days.\n\nSurrounding violence in Catalonia due to the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, the match between FC Barcelona and UD Las Palmas in the 2017–18 La Liga was played behind closed doors. Barcelona first requested the LFP to postpone their match which was to be played on the same day as the referendum. This request was declined by the LFP, saying that, if Barcelona refused to play the match, their six points would be deducted. To protect the fans, as well as in protest to LFP's decision, Barcelona played the match behind closed doors, a first at their stadium, Camp Nou. The match ended 3–0 in favor of Barcelona.\n\nAs part of the sanctions handed to the Philippine men's basketball team in the aftermath of their involvement in their brawl against Australia during their home game on July 2, 2018, the Philippine national team is obliged to play their next home match in the second round of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers behind closed doors with the succeeding two home games being placed under probation. The game that will be played behind closed doors is their home game against Qatar on September 17, 2018 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nThe French league has a tough line on misconduct. Each smoke grenade sent to the pitch results in a fine, which can then result in playing behind closed doors. If the crowd isn't managed, the club may also be punished. Hence, almost every season, a handful of matches are played behind closed doors.\n\nIn Brazil, the practice of games without public access is known as \"closed gates\" (in Portuguese, \"portões fechados\"), even referred as such in the Brazilian Football Confederation's rulebook. Once it was applied to a whole tournament: two rounds of the Campeonato Catarinense second division in 2014 were behind closed doors because the participant clubs did not deliver the security checks for their stadia. Sanitary reasons dictated the restriction in 2009, where two games of the Série D were played behind closed doors due to the H1N1 flu pandemic.\n\nBehind closed doors matches in the major North American sports leagues are exceedingly rare, as local law enforcement, private security contractors working for either the team or a league, and national agencies such as the United States Department of Homeland Security take large roles in preventing situations of fan violence before they can occur by restricting access to known troublesome fans either at the gate or even at the stage of selling tickets (such as 'do not sell' lists), along with heavy restrictions on bringing in items and screening with metal detectors and pat-down searches where bringing in a weapon or explosive device can result in immediate arrest and lifetime ejection from a venue, and other examples such as the \"clear bag\" policy, which only allows spectators to bring in bags that can be easily seen through. Teams also have incentive to prevent fan violence due to forfeit rules which come with penalties to their records and playoff positioning, and league sanctions such as fines and the stripping of draft picks due to neglecting to create a safe environment for players, which in turn can affect teams for years beyond a violent event.\n\nOn 28 April 2015, Major League Baseball announced a game between the Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles to be played at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore that evening would instead start at 2:06 p.m. EDT, with no fans being admitted. The unprecedented decision came due to security concerns related to civil unrest in the city, along with a 10 p.m. EDT curfew which would have required suspension of the game had it been played at its original time. The game was to have been the last game of a three-game series, but the first two had already been postponed due to the unrest. The game was televised in the Baltimore and Chicago markets, and was also offered as a \"free game of the day\" on MLB's streaming service nationwide. Unofficially, some fans were able to watch the game through obstructed gates in left-center field, along with guests at the nearby Hilton Baltimore which overlooks the playing field. This was the first time a North American major league sports event would be held in an empty sports venue; previously in minor league baseball, a 2008 Iowa Cubs game was played without public admittance due to flooding in Des Moines, Iowa, while a 2002 Charleston RiverDogs game in Charleston, South Carolina held a purposeful gimmick \"Nobody Night\" where no one was admitted to the park until the attendance figure was made official after the fifth inning.\n\nWhile large galleries consisting of thousands of fans are standard for top-level professional golf events in the United States, on 30 June 2012, the third round of the 2012 AT&T National at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland was played without fans being admitted due to trees being downed and other storm damage caused by a derecho the night before. Additionally, the start of the third round was delayed to the early afternoon, instead of a morning start that is normal for a round of a golf tournament utilizing a stroke play format, in order to allow for the continuation of course clean-up efforts. This is the first of two recorded instances of any part of a PGA Tour event being played without a gallery present.\n\nIn the 2016 Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course in the La Jolla community of San Diego, California, after inclement weather disrupted play on Sunday and several trees were ripped apart on the golf course, fans were barred from the premises for the Monday conclusion of the final round of the tournament due to safety issues. The 2018 edition of the same tournament also was finished behind closed doors on Monday. The sudden death playoff had reached five holes without a winner, and darkness made it impossible to complete the tournament. The event concluded Monday morning at 8:18 AM behind closed doors.\n\nThe Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League have played in two such \"behind closed doors\" games, both caused by severe winter storms when the opposing team and game officials had already arrived in the city. On 22 January 2016, the Checkers played against the Chicago Wolves behind closed doors because of a severe winter storm , and the same again on 17 January 2018, the Checkers played against the Bridgeport Sound Tigers behind closed doors as a result of inclement weather (ice and snow). Both games were played at Bojangles' Coliseum. \n\nIn 1985, a measles outbreak on campus led Boston University to hold home ice hockey games without spectators for a week, in order to control the disease's spread. Basketball games were also affected, and other large public events on campus, were also temporarily banned.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7556685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7556685", "title": "Bernard Etxepare", "text": "Bernard Etxepare\n\nBernard Etxepare (pronounced ) was a Basque writer of the 16th century, most famous for a collection of poems titled \"Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ\" (\"First Fruits of the Basque Language\") he published in 1545, the first book to be published in the Basque language.\n\nHis first name is also spelled \"Bernat\" or \"Beñat\" in Basque, he himself used Bernat. His surname is spelled \"Etxepare\" in modern Basque but the variant \"Detxepare\" is also occasionally encountered, in Basque or \"Dechepare\" in Spanish, both based on the French spelling \"D'echepare\". He himself used \"Dechepare\".\n\nVery little is known about his life. He was born c. 1470–1480 in the area of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in Lower Navarre. His birthplace is the \"Etxeparia\" farmhouse in Bussunarits-Sarrasquette, and he spent the majority of his life in the valleys of Cize, working as rector in Saint-Michel at the church of Saint-Michel-le-Vieux and vicar in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port.\n\nEtxepare lived through a period of war and upheaval from 1512 onward with the Castilian conquest of Upper Navarre. In one of his poems, \"Mossen Bernat echaparere cantuya\", he confesses to having spent time in prison in Béarn, although the reasons for his detainment are not very clear. According to some, he was accused of having taken the side of Castile in its conflict with Navarre, not least of all due to religious reasons. Others, however, think that the reasons for his incarceration were moral rather than political. Either way, Etxepare maintained that he was innocent.\n\nThe date of his death is unknown.\n\nIn 1545 he published a book in Bordeaux, the \"Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ\", generally assumed to be the first book ever printed in Basque. It contains a collection of poems, some religious in nature, some love poems, one about his life, some extolling the virtues of the Basque language and others. It has been suggested by Oihenart in his \"L´art poétique basque\" from 1665 that some of his prestigious contemporary Basque writers such as Joan Etxegarai and Arnaut Logras who were famous for their pastorals might have been published too. However, if they were, any evidence has been lost.\n\nIt is written in the Lower Navarrese dialect of Basque, using a French-influenced orthography and the metre and style of writing suggest that Etxepare was a bertsolari, a type of Basque poet known for producing sung extemporised poetry.\n\nThe book contains:\n\nThe following example is the \"Contrapas\", which is a poem that broadly sets out Etxepare's motivation for producing this book and his hopes for the language. Etxepare explains that he is the first Basque writer to have his work published in print. He calls for the Basque language to \"go out\" and become more widely known, for the Basques to blaze new trails and make themselves known to the world.\n\nNote that the above rendition into Standard Basque contains several words which would be spelled like that but are rarely used. Instead of \"lengoaje\" \"language\" the indigenous terms \"mintzaira\" or \"hizkuntza\" would be most widely used today for example.\n\nThe only surviving original copy of the book is kept at the National Library of France in Paris. Irrespective of its literary value, his book has enjoyed enduring fame amongst Basques. Especially the last two pieces of his book, or excerpts thereof, are frequently quoted or used otherwise in the Basque scene. During the 1960s for example the Basque musician Xabier Lete produced a musical score to accompany the \"Kontrapas\". More recently, a newly developed speech recognition software tool has been named Sautrela after the final poem in Etxepare's book and a Basque literature series in Basque Television is also named \"Sautrela\".\n\n"}

{"id": "8159569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8159569", "title": "Combinatorial method (linguistics)", "text": "Combinatorial method (linguistics)\n\nThe combinatorial method is a method of linguistic analysis that is used to study texts which are written in an unknown language, and to study the language itself, where the unknown language has no obvious or proven well-understood close relatives, and where there are few bilingual texts which might otherwise have been used to help understand the language. It consists of three distinct analyses:\n\nThe method relies principally on information that is available in and about the language being studied, and has most famously been used for study of the Etruscan language. It has also been used for other languages, for example by Yves Duhoux (1982) for Eteocretan. The method was first advocated by Wilhelm Deeke in his 1875 refutation of Wilhelm Corssen's attempt to demonstrate a supposed relationship between Etruscan and the Indo-European languages by the etymological method, which is based on perceived resemblances between words in the text in the unknown language and words existing in known languages.\n\nThe combinatorial method was developed to replace the etymological method because the latter bases itself on circular reasoning, in which the assumed relationship purportedly proves the interpretation of the text and vice versa, thus being inadequate for scientific study or proof. While mainstream specialists in Etruscology have long since abandoned the etymological method in favour of the slow, rigorous work of the combinatorial method, the etymological method is still popular with amateurs wishing to prove a relationship between ancient texts and an existing language.\n\nArchaeological-antiquarian analysis consists of using archaeological and antiquarian methods to determine the nature of the text, such as the nature of the object bearing the inscription, and the circumstances and location of its discovery. An example of ignoring this stage would be to describe the Pyrgi Tablets as part of a temple archive, as some commentators did when the tablets were found in 1964, when quite clearly the tablets had been nailed to a wall as a notice. Part of this stage is also rigorously checking the epigraphic or palaeographic details of the inscription concerned. Vladimir Georgiev's claim that Etruscan is related to Hittite was largely based on a non-existent word \"esmi\" which had been incorrectly read from an inscription, while Mario Alinei's 2003 claim that the word \"iθal\" means \"drink\" and that Etruscan is thus based on Hungarian is ruled out by the fact that \"iθal\" occurs in one single inscription and does not re-occur in the many hundreds of known inscribed Etruscan symposium vessels which might be expected to contain the word \"drink\" if their Latin equivalents are anything to go by.\n\nFormal-structural analysis consists of breaking down words into their component morphemes to form a hypothesis of the structure of the language, which must be consistent with that deduced from other interpreted or partly interpreted inscriptions, and with the features that might be expected in known languages. The point of this stage is to reveal the root words and their roles in the text. While establishing the meaning of the word or morpheme is not the key goal at this stage, it can however rule out potential meanings. For example, Zacharie Mayani's claim that Etruscan \"θu\" means \"two\" is ruled out by the fact that \"θu\" is the only Etruscan numeral which is never found with a plural referent, and in addition it does not have a derived multiple of 10 based on it, which points to it meaning not \"two\" but \"one\".\n\nOnce both the root form of a word and an idea of its role in the text and elsewhere are established, an analysis of content and context can be carried out to determine the word's part of speech, or whether it is part of a name, and if so, the sex of the person, and if an object or an action, its likely nature or general semantic area. This stage must also ensure that any proposed more definite meaning is consistent with all other instances, but must also allow for the possibility of homonyms with different meanings and morphemes with more than one purpose.\n\nMeanings and interpretations established by the combinatorial method are not certain, for example, as meanings confirmed by a bilingual text or by a reliable ancient gloss, but are of variable reliability, and as provisional models. The understanding of the Etruscan language has gradually increased over the years, as new knowledge from the Etruscan texts themselves, and from research in other disciplines of Etruscology. Giulio Facchetti's research into Etruscan private law (2000) taken together with the publication of the text of the Cortona tablet in 1999 is an example of where this has happened.\n\n"}

In the medical context, it usually refers to the surgical correction of a disfiguring defect, or the cosmetic improvements made by a surgeon following incisions. Its use is generally limited to the additional, usually minor, steps that the surgeon (who is generally operating for noncosmetic indications) takes to improve the aesthetic appearance of the scars associated with the operation. Typical actions include removal of damaged tissue, mitigation of tension on the wound, and/or using fine (thin) sutures to close the outer layer of skin.\n\nCosmetic surgery is the portion of plastic surgery that concerns itself with the elective improvement of cosmesis.\n\nThe practice of cosmesis, the creation of lifelike limbs made from silicone or PVC, has grown in popularity. Such prosthetics, such as artificial hands, can now be made to mimic the appearance of real limbs, complete with freckles, veins, hair, fingerprints, and even tattoos. Custom-made cosmeses are generally more expensive, costing thousands of US dollars depending on the level of detail. Standard cosmeses come ready-made in various sizes, though they are often not as realistic as their custom-made counterparts.

Example: If two separate entities can be said to be \"water\", then combining them into one entity will yield more \"water\". If two separate entities can be said to be \"a house\", their combination cannot be said to be \"a house\". Hence, \"water\" has cumulative reference, while the expression \"a house\" does not. The plural form \"houses\", however, \"does\" have cumulative reference. If two (groups of) entities are both \"houses\", then their combination will still be \"houses\".\n\nCumulativity has proven relevant to the linguistic treatment of the mass/count distinction and for the characterization of grammatical telicity.\n\nFormally, a cumulativity predicate \"CUM\" can be defined as follows, where capital \"X\" is a variable over sets, \"U\" is the universe of discourse, \"p\" is a mereological part structure on \"U\", and formula_1 is the mereological sum operation.\n\nformula_2\n\nIn later work, Krifka has generalized the notion to \"n\"-ary predicates, based on the phenomenon of \"cumulative quantification\".

First proposed by Keith Whinnom at the 1968 Mona conference, the concept has come under fire in recent years from such linguists as Derek Bickerton and John R. Rickford since at its inception it sought to overturn long-held elements of the theory of creole continua.\n\nDecreolization is a process of homogenization a creole language may undergo when in contact with one of its parent languages, particularly if the parent language is ascribed a prestige value. To put it another way, in decreolization, the influence of the superstrate language dismantles influences from substrate languages.\n\nIf one views pidginization as a process of simplification, reduction, and admixture from substrate languages, and creolization as the expansion of the language to combat reduction, then one would view decreolization as an attack on both simplification and admixture.\n\nAs languages remain in contact over time, they inevitably influence one another. Typically, the language with higher prestige (most often the lingua franca) will exert a much greater influence on the lower prestige language (the creole). This leads to the reintroduction of complexities, irregularities and redundancies into the creole from the source language. Elements of other sources begin to disappear as there is less and less linguistic territory for them to cover. It is theorized that eventually the creole will resemble the source language to such a degree that it can then be called a dialect of that language rather than a separate language at all.\n\nAnother name for a near-fully decreolized language is a “vestigial post-creole.”\n\nDecreolization processes occurred in creoles ranging from Brazil in South America as well in Africa, to Macau and Daman in Asia. The Asian and American creoles existed in continua with forms of Portuguese and underwent a process of decreolization when the Asian places were still overseas provinces of Portugal, and from the 18th century when the línguas gerais were forbidden by Marquis of Pombal to about one century after the Brazilian independence along in the Americas. These older processes can best be seen or studied in Daman and Diu Portuguese and Macanese Patois, which converged with Standard Portuguese.\n\nIn Africa, these are contemporary processes in post-independence Africa. In Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau the creoles are dominant over Portuguese, but undergoing decreolization processes, leading to the development of \"soft creoles\" in both Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau and post-creole continua with noncreolized Portuguese. In São Tomé and Príncipe, the situation is different from Upper Guinea as noncreolized Portuguese is dominant over the creoles, and children are intentionally raised in Standard Portuguese by their parents, leading to the younger generations in Principe Island not even being able to understand the island's creole or not valuing it.\n"}

However, it was later renamed to \"Bahagian Bahasa dan Pustaka\" (Language and Literature Section) in 1962. At the time it was established under the authority of \"Jabatan Pelajaran\" or the Department of Education, the predecessor to the Ministry of Education. On 1 January 1965, it was made into a separate department and eventually adopted its current name. In 1984, Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka Brunei was subsumed under the authority of the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports.\n\nDewan Bahasa dan Pustaka Brunei publishes Kamus Bahasa Melayu Brunei, the official dictionary of the Brunei Malay language, the de facto lingua franca in Brunei. The dictionary was first published in 1991 and it is currently in its second edition, with entries over 15,000.\n\nThe Dewan also publishes four journals, namely Bahasa, Beriga, Pangsura and Undang-Undang Syariah, as well as three magazines, namely Bahana, Juara Pelajar and Mekar.\n\nDewan Bahasa dan Pustaka Brunei operates all public libraries in the country, which include:\n\n"}

It is a non-destructive technique (will not damage the evidence in question), allowing further tests to be carried out. It is a sensitive technique capable of detecting indentations on pages several layers below the top sheet and many years after the indentations were created.\n\nEDD equipment and investigative techniques were central to overturning a number of convictions in the United Kingdom, as it was possible to demonstrate that witness statements had been altered or signed as blank pages in reverse order to the main notes. This was central in a number of cases investigated at the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad that were appealed. The allegations of tampering with evidence and witness statements led to the unit being disbanded, and over 60 convictions being quashed, many of the appeals relying on EDA evidence.\n\nWhen writing is fashioned on a sheet of paper resting upon other pages, the indentations or impressions produced are transferred to those below. These transferred impressions can be detected using an EDD.\n\nIn some situations, a questioned document such as a ransom note, or an extortion letter, may exist which can be determined to be the source of indentations detected on another piece of paper (e.g., an offender's notepad). Alternatively, indentations detected on a business contract might match information present on another such document. In some situations this would be an entirely innocent finding; however, if the two businesses are supposed to be operating independent of one another, then the finding could be significant. Decipherable indentations may also provide valuable information even when a second document is not present or cannot be located. For example, an anonymous letter may bear impressions of writing that relate to some mundane activity of the offender which could ultimately lead an investigator to a particular suspect.\n\nThe electro-physical basis whereby an EDD actually works is complex. The original theory suggested that the paper sandwiched between the grounded platen and the mylar charging film acted as a type of capacitor with the change in capacitance being due to differing compression of the paper. This led to models like the 'Thickness Variation Theory' and the 'Surface Variation Theory'. However, it turns out that a detectable 'indentation' is not due to the physical pressure applied to the writing instrument as one might expect. Rather, Seward in 1998 and 1999 proposed an alternative theory explaining the detection capability of an EDD as being due to a surface charge effect created by paper-to-paper friction specifically in the area where a writing instrument is pressed down into the top-most sheet of paper. Seward's model was based upon \"charge transport through the Mylar-paper-platen structure\" and is appropriately called the 'charge transport model'.\n\nSubsequent testing demonstrated that the charge transport model, while not perfect, is sound. This testing also clarified that areas of indentation are less negatively charged than surrounding areas. It is this relative difference in potential that causes the toner to be attracted to the areas of indentation, rather than other areas on the mylar surface.\n\nSeward's model also helps to explain two unusual phenomena sometimes observed when using an EDD:\n\nAdditionally, indentations can sometimes not develop very well even though they are clearly visible. This may occur, for example, with very heavy or deep impressions or with impressions in glossy heavy-weight paper such as that used for brochures. In such situations, it is possible to use digital scanning and image-processing to document such writing impressions.\n\nDespite the complexity of the underlying theoretical mechanism, the practical use of an EDD is straightforward. Most devices are similar in their operation. The following are the key steps in using an EDD to visualize indentations:\n\nAside from visualizing indentations, the method can be used to detect the presence of fresh fingerprints, fiber disturbance on the paper surface (e.g. relating to mechanical erasure of information), or the presence of footwear impressions on paper.\n\nAn EDD is a highly specialized device and there are only a few manufacturers:\n\n"}

{"id": "3554155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3554155", "title": "Family Viewing Hour", "text": "Family Viewing Hour\n\nThe Family Viewing Hour was a policy established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States in 1975. Under the policy, each television network in the U.S. had a responsibility to air \"family-friendly\" programming during the first hour of the prime time lineup (8 to 9 p.m. Eastern Time). The hour disappeared in 1977 after the policy was overturned in court; however, the concept has continued to be used by some viewers who still believe that the 8:00 p.m. time slot in primetime has an obligation to have family-friendly programming.\n\nIn 1974, there was widespread public criticism regarding the amount of sex and violence then on American television. Although there are several examples, there was one television scene that caused a particularly strong backlash. The 1974 NBC television movie \"Born Innocent\" featured a lesbian rape scene, and was even briefly shown in daytime promotional spots for the film. The scene drew much outcry upon its first airing and was blamed for the real-life rape of a young girl, which led to a case before the California Supreme Court. \n\nIn January 1975, then-FCC chairman Richard E. Wiley addressed the Senate and House Communications and Commerce Subcommittees, stating that all three networks agreed to adopt a \"family viewing hour\" in response to the criticism. The National Association of Broadcasters took the gesture one step further, decreeing that local stations also air family friendly programming in the 7 p.m. time slot, which was given to the affiliates to air what they wished.\n\nThe president of CBS at the time wanted to go through with the measure but would only agree if NBC and ABC consented, citing a possible decline in ratings (the network had been #1 in U.S. households since the mid-1950s) if they were the only network to try the new policy. By the end of 1974, each network executive agreed to endorse the Family Viewing Hour, and to implement it by the fall 1975 season.\n\nIndeed, many television series suffered from the Family Viewing Hour mandate. \"All in the Family\", which was the runaway top-rated show in the U.S. since 1971, was moved to 9 p.m. on Mondays after five seasons leading the Saturday night lineup. Producer Norman Lear, citing an infringement on creative freedom and on his First Amendment rights, mounted a lawsuit. With the support of varying guilds, including the WGA, he won the case. The show's cast responded by recording a satirical, never-aired rendition of the show's theme song, retitled \"These Are the Days\".\n\nOn November 4, 1976, United States district court Judge Warren J. Ferguson declared the Family Viewing Hour null and void, starting with the fall 1977 season. Ferguson stated while the idea was good in theory, the FCC had overstepped its bounds in having it instituted; the FCC privately lobbied the three major networks to adopt the policy instead of holding public hearings on the matter, and Ferguson ruled on those grounds that the Family Viewing Hour had no binding merit. The decree made by the National Association of Broadcasters in 1975 was also overturned, giving stations free rein on what to air in the pre-prime time slots.\n\nAfter the Family Viewing Hour was declared unconstitutional, the networks continued voluntarily to offer family-friendly programs such as \"The Cosby Show\" and \"Happy Days\" in the early primetime hours, so some families still believed in the concept. Due to this point of view, in 1989, Michigan housewife Terry Rakolta started a highly public letter-writing campaign to persuade advertisers to stop sponsoring the Fox network sitcom \"Married... with Children\" after watching the episode \"Her Cups Runneth Over\" with her three youngest children. Consequently, two companies completely withdrew sponsorship from the show, while other companies, including The Coca-Cola Company, simply reduced sponsorship. Starting in the 2000-2001 season, ABC stopped showing commercials for R-rated films during the first hour of primetime. In 2003, \"The New York Times\" reported that FCC commissioner Kevin Martin called to bring back the Family Hour.\n\nIn 2001, the Parents Television Council (PTC) campaigned for the FCC to reuse the Family Hour voluntarily following its report \"The Sour Family Hour\". Over the years, the PTC has run numerous reports claiming that the so-called \"Family Hour\" of 8:00 p.m. (7:00 p.m. in Central and Mountain Time Zones) is becoming more unsuitable for family viewing, having released a report in September 2007.\n\nBernard Goldberg and Zell Miller have used the term \"family hour\" in their books to describe the early primetime hours as well.\n"}

But the phrase morphed into a romantic context in the 1988 movie \"Casual Sex?\" in which it was used in the middle of a seduction scene.\n\nIn 1989, a column written from the perspective of a sexually frustrated wife who uses the term \"ran stateside in syndication\", and in the same year an Australian comedian named Anthony Ackroyd deemed the line \"unavoidably unoriginal\".\n\nThe phrase was popularized by a 1993 episode of \"Seinfeld\" in which George Costanza gets dumped by a woman who uses the phrase on him, to which he replies that he uses it as well.\n\n\"Psychology Today\" offered an expanded version which reads: \"'It's not you, it's me.'

They became an example as well as an exponent of how the French-speaking bourgeoisie (from Wallonia but also from Flanders) treated their Flemish fellow-citizens, of whom the language – if not its speakers – was considered inferior by the elite.\nLater on, the real perpetrators confessed to the murder, which in 1873 led to a debate in parliament that ended in the \"Coremans Act\", one of the first laws to recognize Dutch as an official language in Belgium, allowing the Flemish to use their own language at Flemish courts, though not yet in Brussels.\n\nOn 23 March 1860, widow Dubois was the victim of an assault and robbery by night in Couillet near Charleroi. She was discovered in agony only the next day, and died of her injuries a few days later. To the village policeman, she had only been able to utter that her attackers spoke \"Flemish\". Consequently, the attention was drawn on two Flemings who had been making a living in the region, Jan Coucke, a forty-nine-year-old potato salesman born in Sint-Denijs near Kortrijk, and Pieter Goethals, a railroad worker originating from Lotenhulle and thirty-four years of age.\n\nTheir trial in French at the Assize Court of Hainaut in Mons started on 20 August 1860. Although both lived in Couillet, Wallonia, and spoke French for their work, they were assisted by a Dutch translator, Pierre Van Horenbeek.\n\nProsecutor Charles-Victor de Bavay obtained their death sentence five days later. They were beheaded on the Grand Market Place of Charleroi a few weeks later.\n\nIn 1861, a year after the execution, 14 members of the infamous Black Gang were to appear before the same assize court. The leader of the gang, Leopold Rabet, confessed that French-speaking gang members had killed the widow Dubois. Jean-Baptiste Boucher and Auguste Leclercq confessed to having committed the murder and were sentenced to death. They also confessed that although Coucke and Goethals did not kill the widow, they were their accomplices.\n\nOn 18 July 2005 at the Belgian federal parliament, Filip De Man directed a series of questions at the vice-prime minister and minister of Justice (Laurette Onkelinx), regarding the case Coucke and Goethals. His introduction stated that since 1861 there had been several attempts to officially restore the honour of Coucke and Goethals. In 2000, Johan Vande Lanotte, and Geert Goedertier had still written (in \"België voor beginners. Wegwijs in het Belgisch labyrint\", p. 27, die Keure, Brugge) that Coucke and Goethals were not the murderers of the widow, but were informed on the murder. In 1948, a study by the Flemish journalist Herman Bossier had concluded that there had not been a miscarriage of justice, as according to the journalist, the declaration by Rabet included errors and two other members of the Black Gang, after their trial, had talked about the Flemish as accomplices; the interpreter would not have been a \"gendarme\" from Luxembourg, but a sworn translator of Dutch origin (\"Nederlandse afkomst\"). On five occasions Goethals would have confessed and as chief railroad worker he had to know the French language, while Coucke sold vegetables to French-speaking customers and, having had money problems before the murder, thereafter had means of which he could not demonstrate the origin.\n\nThe Member of Parliament then asked whether the \"dossier\" of the trial case could be looked into by MPs or by civilians, and whether it corroborated the journalist's statements about Rabet, the interpreter, Goethals' confessions, and Coucke's financial situation. He also wished to know whether the nine death penalties of 17 January 1862 by the same court of which seven had been reduced, were connected to the Black Gang and thus to Boucher, Leclerq, and Rabet. Would the Minister of Justice in this case be willing to ask the advice of the Attorney General at the Appeal Court of Mons, and to ask for the revision of the verdict of 1869, or to provide reasons for not asking the latter.\n\nThe Minister replied one year later, on 24 July 2006. The confession of guilt by third parties can be considered as a \"new fact\" having taken place after the conviction, offering the possibility to review the case. The criticism and advises that several authors may have brought forward, do not form a ground for a revision. According to the Minister, of the mentioned elements, only the statement by Rabet form such a ground in as far it is of a nature that proves the innocence of the convicts and it has been made in circumstances giving credibility to that statement or confession. The mentioned information however, does not offer the possibility to assess the reality, the circumstances, and the reach of the declarations by Rabet. The \"dossier\" on the case can be viewed if the Attorney General at the Appeal Court of Mons gives his permission, even in case it is in the National Archives as it is over a hundred years old.\n\n\n"}

His father Jan Nisar Akhtar was a Bollywood film songwriter and Urdu poet, and his mother Safia Akhtar was a singer, teacher and writer. His grandfather Muztar Khairabadi was a poet as was his grandfather's elder brother, Bismil Khairabadi, while his great great grandfather, Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi, was a scholar of Islamic studies and theology and played an important role in the First Independence Movement of India in 1857. Javed Akhtar's original name was Jadoo, taken from a line in a poem written by his father: \"Lamha, lamha kisi jadoo ka fasana hoga\". He was given the official name of Javed since it was the closest to the word \"jadoo\". He spent most of his childhood and was schooled in Lucknow. He graduated from Saifiya College in Bhopal.\n\nInitially, in the 1970s, there was no concept of having the same writer for the screenplay, story and dialogue, nor were the writers given any credits in the titles. Rajesh Khanna is credited with giving Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar their first chance to become screenplay writers by offering them work in \"Haathi Mere Saathi\". Javed Akhtar stated in an interview that \"One day, he went to Salimsaab and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow, Aashirwad. But the film was a remake and the script of the original was far from being satisfactory. He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit.\"\n\nTheir first big success was the script for \"Andaz\", followed by \"Adhikar\" (1971), \"Haathi Mere Saathi\" and \"Seeta Aur Geeta\" (1972).

They have worked together in 24 films including two Kannada films – \"Premada Kanike\" and \"Raja Nanna Raja\". Of the 24 films they wrote, 20 were hits. The scripts they wrote, but which were not successful at box office include \"Aakhri Dao\" (1975), \"Immaan Dharam\" (1977), \"Kaala Patthar\" (1979) and \"Shaan\" (1980). Though they split in 1982, due to ego issues, some of the scripts they wrote were made into hit films later, such as \"Zamana\" and \"Mr. India\". Salim-Javed, many a time described as \"the most successful scriptwriters of all-time\", are also noted to be the first scriptwriters in Indian cinema to achieve star status.\n\nAkhtar was nominated to the Parliament upper house Rajya Sabha on 16 November 2009.\n\nAkhtar was a Muslim but later became an atheist. He has brought up his children Farhan and Zoya Akhtar also as atheists.\n\nAkhtar was married to Honey Irani, with whom he had two children, Farhan Akhtar and Zoya Akhtar, both film directors and actors. The father-and-son duo have worked together in films such as \"Dil Chahta Hai\", \"Lakshya\", \"Rock On!!\" and \"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara\" with Zoya.

Mohanty died on 6 April 1994 at the age of 87.\n\nMohanty wrote his first novel \"Utshabe Byasane\" during 1923–24. However, the novel was never published and its manuscript could not be traced later. His novels first published in 1930, \"Arana\" and \"Patalaka\". His 1932 published novel \"Nishpatti\" is considered as the first Oriya novel to depict the events of a marriage between a child and a widow. He published two novels in 1944, \"Bhala Paibara Sesha Katha\" and \"Tunda Baida\". \"Bhala Paibara Sesha Katha\" portrays the untouchability in the Indian society and \"Tunda Baida\" depicts the relation between a widow and her younger brother-in-law and rumors spread about them by villagers. While \"Haa Anna\" (1935) was set against the backdrop of Orissa famine of 1866, his 1946 published novel \"Shasti\" (Punishment) depicts famine's aftermath and pestilence during the years 1866 and 1870. Both the novels portrayed the romantic love stories with social and economical inequality. His Sahitya Akademi Award-winning novel \"Kaa\" (Impersonation, 1956) deals with the subject of female infertility and maternal death. In \"Kshana Kshanake Ana \" (The World Changes Every Moment, 1975) Mohanty narrates the story of step-mothers and domestic violence. He published fifty-six novels in a career spanning over six decades from 1930 to 1985 with \"Jaksha\" (1985) being his last published novel.\n\nMohanty is considered as \"one of the most popular and celebrated novelists of Odisa\". He is known for depicting social realism and most of his work involved problems associated with plight of woman, caste and economic exploitation. It was noted that he, being a upper caste writer, portrayed lower caste characters in his writings. His novels are set around coastal Odisa. Scholar Sisir Kumar Das appreciated Mohanty's authentic illustration of regions compared to actual geographical location but noted that the author has tendency to create an Utopian world while representing the human life. \"Shasti\" (1946) is considered as \"one of the best progressive writings in Oriya\" and \"one of the earliest novels to use psychoanalysis to reveal different moods and emotions of its characters\". Mohanty's work, in terms of its theme and writing style, is noted to be on the similar lines of another Odia novelist Fakir Mohan Senapati (1843–1918) with more critical social and cultural evaluation but lacking sense of humour and satire of Senapati. He said to have been influenced by \"The Woodlanders\" (1887) by Thomas Hardy for \"Shasti\" and by \"Pavilion of Women\" (1946) by Pearl S. Buck for \"Kaa\" (Impersonation, 1956).\n\nIn 2006, The Government of Odisha decided to republish three Odia novels, \"Kaa\" by Mohanty, \"Matira Manisha\" (1931) by Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, and \"Mamu\" (1913) by Fakir Mohan Senapati to increase the popularity of Odia language among the youth. In January 2007, the Sahitya Akademi and Sarala Sahitya Sansad organised a two-day national seminar, \"Kanhu Charan and the Rise of Indian Novel\", to commemorate Mohanty's birth centenary. Odia novelist and a pioneer member of Sarala Sahitya Sansad, Pravakar Swain, noted that \"[Mohanty's] books had a social commitment and sympathy for the insulted and the injured\".\n\nSome of Mohanty's novels were later made into films. 1965 Odia film \"Abhinetri\" (The Actress) is based on his 1947 published novel by the same name and marked first occurrence of Dual role, played by Jharna Das, in Odia cinema. Another novel \"Kaa\" (1956) was later made into a film \"Kaa\" (1966). The film was awarded the Certificate of Merit for the Best Feature Film in Odia at 14th National Film Awards. \"Tunda Baida\" (Gossip, 1944) was also made into a film in 1987 by the same name.\n\nMohanty won several awards for his literary work. He won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1958 for \"Kaa\", the Jeevan Rang Prize in 1970, and the Neela Saila Award in 1992. On 4 February 1994, the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, selected him as its fellow, the highest honour conferred by the Akademi; however, Mohanty died on 6 April 1994 before the honour could formally be conferred upon him.\n\nMohanty published the following works under his name:\n\n\n"}

Motivation is the most used concept for explaining the failure or success of a language learner. Second language (L2) refers to a language an individual learns that is not his/her mother tongue, but is of use in the area of the individual. It is not the same as a foreign language, which is a language learned that is not generally spoken in the individual’s area. In research on motivation, it is considered to be an internal process that gives behavior energy, direction and persistence in research (in other words, it gives behavior strength, purpose, and sustainability).\nLearning a new language takes time and dedication. Once you do, being fluent in a second language offers numerous benefits and opportunities. Learning a second language is exciting and beneficial at all ages. It offers practical, intellectual and many aspirational benefits.\nIn learning a language, there can be one or more goals – such as mastery of the language or communicative competence – that vary person to person. There are a number of language learner motivation models that were developed and postulated in fields such as linguistics and sociolinguistics, with relations to second-language acquisition in a classroom setting. The different perspectives on L2 motivation can be divided into three distinct phases: the social psychological period, the cognitive-situated period and the process-oriented period.\n\nSocial psychological perspectives on L2 learning motivation emphasize the role of the individuals’ social context and social interactions. The social psychological period in L2 motivation research flourished in the bilingual context of Canada from 1959 through 1990 (Dörnyei, 2005; Ushioda, 2012). During this period, Gardner developed the socio-educational model while Clément and colleagues explored the theory of linguistic self-confidence.\n\nR.C. Gardner formulated the socio-educational model suggesting that learning an L2 cannot be solely explained by people’s aptitude or their competency to acquire as many languages. He asserted that individual differences were key factors affecting L2 acquisition such that in understanding how the L2 learning process and outcomes work, it is important to consider the cultural contexts, which influence people’s attitude and motivation in learning another culturally distinct language. By simply regarding aptitude as the only factor, researchers dismiss the social, contextual and pragmatic reasons that drive people to learn other languages.\n\nThe original socio-educational model (1979) proposed that there are two main factors that influence L2 performance: aptitude, and motivation in learning. The model, however, placed more emphasis on the motivation factor because Gardner was interested in how people succeeded in acquiring L2 even when it seemed that their competency/aptitude is below average. This meant that motivation played a bigger role in driving those people to learn an L2. The model then attempted to explain that these motivational factors took place in the sites where\nL2 learning occurs: the formal site (i.e. the educational context), and the informal site (i.e. the cultural context). Gardner argued that these two contexts play distinct roles in boosting the learner’s L2 performance in that the educational context became a place where explicit instruction and correction occurs, whereas the cultural context was an area allowing the learners to become immersed in the other culture without placing any specific rules or instructions. Both ways, the learners become increasingly knowledgeable and more confident with the social and cultural settings behind the L2, and these motivate them to learn L2 even more. Upon this transition, linguistic and non-linguistic outcomes emerge. In the linguistic component, learners tend to develop L2 proficiency and fluency, whereas in the non-linguistic outcomes, they undergo changes in attitudes towards the culture where the L2 came from.\n\nThe process of L2 acquisition starts from the social milieu where learners have initial attitudes towards the culture behind the L2; these preset beliefs were acquired from their own cultures.\nThe social milieu, in turn, influences the strategies, which individuals use in acquiring the L2. After knowing the individual differences in L2 acquisition, it is important to consider the context of learning (i.e. educational or cultural) because they improve L2 performance through direct (i.e. explicit instruction) and indirect (i.e. cultural immersion) means. Finally, when the learners have already acquired experience and knowledge of the L2, they gain varying positive outcomes such as fluency and appreciation of the other culture.\n\nThe model has undergone numerous revisions to capture the sub-processes underlying in each of the individual factors. In 1985, Gardner introduced three sub-measures namely the intensity, the desire to learn and the attitude towards learning to explain the motivation factor. Gardner argued that if these three criteria work together, the learner could effectively use motivation as a tool for L2 acquisition. Dornyei and other researchers, however, assert that this is not the case; they contend that one can have a ‘strong’ desire to learn, but have a different attitude towards the learning process itself. Nevertheless, some researches still claim the attitude towards learning has a high predictive capacity because attitude has a strong association with direct behavior (i.e. learning). From 1993 to 2010, the model’s schema was rigorously changed to encompass the variability in the external factors affecting L2 learning; the term “social milieu” became “the external factors”. More characteristics were added to describe the variables affecting each of the individual factors; these were compiled in the Attitude Motivation Test Battery developed by Gardner.\n\nGardner also created the Attitude Motivation Test Battery (AMTB) to quantitatively measure the four main factors and their sub-units, and to predict L2 performance/outcome of the learning. The test generally instructs participants to rate a set of statements on a scale of 1 to 7 (i.e. least likely to most likely), and on a 6-level Likert Scale (i.e. strongly disagree to strongly agree). Different statements correspond to a certain variable (or main factor), and scores from those sets are added up to determine how much of that variable is influencing the language learning of the participants. Like the model, however, the test has also been revised over the years. In Gardner’s review of the Socio-educational Model, he named the four overarching variables which are measured in the AMTB: (1) integrativeness, (2) attitude toward learning situation, (3) motivation and (4) language anxiety. Other variables such as the instrumental orientation and parental encouragement in the AMTB are used in different settings or as needed.\n\nThe integrativeness variable (also known as the integrative motive) reflect the cultural context of L2 learning as it attempts to measure how open a learner is to the other culture that primarily uses L2. The AMTB assesses this variable by accounting for the extent to which the learner is generally interested in foreign languages, as well as his/her preset attitudes towards the community where the L2 comes from. It also accounts for the integrative orientation of the individual or the social and cultural reasons why the individual learns the L2.\n\nContrary to integrativeness, the attitude towards learning situation accounts for the education context of L2 acquisition and the affective facts that correspond with it. The AMTB measures this variable by asking the individual to evaluate the teacher and the course in the educational context. This determines how much the educational context aids in improving L2 performance.\n\nMotivation, in the AMTB, is assessed through the combination of the desire to learn, attitude towards learning, and motivational intensity. While integrativeness and attitude toward the learning situation target each site of learning, motivation accounts for both contexts as well as the affective variables (i.e. individual differences) that influence the two contexts.\n\nIn the AMTB, language anxiety is an affective variable, which corresponds to what the individuals feel when ‘performing’ the L2. In the AMTB, it is measured by determining how anxious the learner feels when in the classroom or when using the language in general.\n\nClément and his associates investigated the importance of social contextual factors on L2 acquisition. Of these social contextual factors, Dörnyei (2005) argues linguistic self-confidence plays the most important role in motivation in learning a second language. Linguistic self-confidence refers to a person’s perceptions of their own competence and ability to accomplish tasks successfully. This linguistic self-confidence is established through the interaction between the language learner and members of the language community, and strengthened based on the quality and quantity of these interactions. In multi-linguistic communities, self-confidence fosters language learners’ identification with the language community and increases their willingness to pursue learning that language.\n\nCognitive perspectives focus on how the learners’ mental processes influence their motivation. During the late 1980s and 1990s, emphasis in the language learning motivation field shifted towards cognitive models, reflecting the “cognitive revolution” taking place in psychology at the time. Cognitive psychologists argued that how one thinks about one’s abilities, possibilities, potentials, limitations, and past performances has major influences on motivation. Thus, L2 motivation models shifted away from the broad social psychological perspectives, while more narrow-viewed microperspectives emerged. During this time, note-worthy contributions were made by Noels and colleagues through a self-determination theory-based model of language learning motivation, Ushioda through attribution theory, as well as Williams and Burden with their social constructivist model.\n\nThe self-determination theory focuses on the intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of motivation. Noels and colleagues explored this theory in the language learning context and developed the Language Learning Orientations Scale which categorizes a person’s motivational orientation as either intrinsic, extrinsic, or amotivated based on a continuum of self-determination. In this line of research it was found that in the language learning classroom, teachers that were autonomy supportive and non-controlling promoted intrinsic and self-determined orientations of motivation in students.\n\nAttribution theory contends that the causal reasons we attribute to our past successes or failures plays a critical role in our motivation in future endeavors in that area. Consistent with this theory, Ushioda identified two attributional patterns associated with positive motivational outcomes in language learning. The first involves attributing one’s successes in learning the language to personal factors, while the second involves attributing one’s failures to temporary forces which may be overcome.\n\nThis cognitive perspective arose from a supposed “constructivist movement” that stemmed mostly from the work of Jean Piaget and that also encompassed personal construct psychology (developed by George Kelly (psychologist)). This model suggests a constructive nature of the learning process as emphasized by Piaget, this assumes that people are actively involved in constructing personal meaning right from birth. This brings the learner into central focus in learning theory as everyone is constructing their own sense of the world, which is key to the constructivist perspective.\n\nThe learner is in control of his/her learning as a result of his/her cognitive processing and organizing, and the context in which he/she is learning. This means that the individual who is learning is in control of what he/she learns based on the way he/she think, and the immediate environment he/she is in as well as any internal factors (mood, preoccupation, motivation, etc.). Four key elements (the learner(s), the teacher, the task, and the context) are outlined by this model as affecting the teaching-learning process as they interact with and act on each other.\n\nUsing the social constructivist model, Marion Williams and Robert L. Burden developed a framework of motivation in language learning as an attempt to summarize motivational factors relevant to L2 learning in the classroom setting. This framework placed an emphasis on contextual influences, and it categorized motivational factors in terms of learner-internal and external factors. The framework is shown below:\n\nWith the rise of cognitive approaches to L2 learning motivation, researchers began to focus on the dynamic character of motivation. The models of the process-oriented period explore the short-term and long-term changes in the individuals’ motivation as they learn L2. This approach views motivation as a dynamic factor which fluctuates within a class period, a year, and a lifetime. Models from this period include the process model and the motivational self-system.\n\nDörnyei and Ottό developed a process model of L2 learning marked by three distinct, chronological stages: the preactional stage, the actional stage, and the postactional stage. The preactional stage involves the initial choice to begin learning a second language and creating goals for oneself. This stage is associated with setting goals, forming intentions, and launching action. During the preactional phase, the major motivational influences are the values associated with L2 learning, attitudes towards the L2-speaking community, learners’ expectations and beliefs, and environmental support. The actional stage includes sustaining one’s level of motivation throughout the language-learning process. This stage involves generating and carrying out subtasks, appraising one’s achievement, and self-regulation. During the actional stage the major motivational influences are the quality of the L2 learning experience, sense of autonomy as an L2 learner, teachers’ and parents’ influence, and usage of self-regulatory strategies. Lastly, the postactional stage involves retrospection and self-reflection on the language learning experience and outcomes. This stage entails forming causal attributions, elaborating standards and strategies, and dismissing the intention and further planning. During the postactional stage the major motivational influences are the learners’ attributional styles and biases, self-concept beliefs, and received feedback during the L2 learning process.\n\nAfter developing the process model, Dörnyei (2005) designed the motivational self-system of L2 learning. The L2 motivational self-system forms links with conceptualizations of L2 motivation by Noels (2003) and Ushioda (2001). This motivational self-system has three components: the ideal L2 self, ought-to L2 self, and L2 learning experience. The ideal L2 self is a person’s imagined ideal future self as a second language speaker. This ideal L2 self promotes motivation by inspiring the present self to strive to become the ideal self, which promotes integrative and internalized instrumental motivation in language learning. The ought-to L2 self includes the attributions a person believes they should have in order to meet expectations or avoid negative outcomes, which is associated with extrinsic motivational orientations. The L2 learning experience component includes the situational and environmental aspects of the language learning process as well as one’s subjective learning experience.\n\nMotivation and Context \n\nMotivation and its constructs are context dependent and therefore, any language learning context has its own unique motivational model. \n\n"}

The most important influences were from Middle and Modern Bulgarian, with some smaller influences from Serbian (in Wallachia) and Russian (in Moldavia). Starting with the 15th century, the language was also influenced by Romanian language.\n\nAfter the Slavic migrations, Slavonic became the liturgical language of the Eastern Orthodox Church in present-day Romania, under the influence of the South Slavic feudal states. The exact timing of this change happened is not known, but it was probably in the 10th century. While the language was not understood by most Romanians, it was a language known by the bishops, the monks, some of the priests, the clerks, the merchants, the boyars and the Prince.\n\nOld Church Slavonic was also used as a literary language, for example in chronicles, story-books, law codexes (known as \"pravila\"), property documents (\"hrisov\"), decrees of the voivodes or boyars, diplomatic correspondence and sometimes even in private letters. It also led to an integration of the written Romanian culture into the Slavic culture of the neighbours.\n\nThe earliest contracts (\"zapis\") to be written in Romanian rather than Slavonic date from 1575-1590 and by 1655-1660, all the administrative documents at the Princely Courts of both Wallachia and Moldavia were written in Romanian.\n\nThe replacement of Slavonic religious texts with Romanian versions began with the first translations in Máramaros (now Maramureş) in the late 15th century, further translations being created in Transylvania after the Protestant Reformation. In Wallachia, the gospels were translated into the vernacular between 1512-1518 and by the middle of the 16th century, the earliest religious works were printed, while the first complete bible in Romanian being print in Bucharest in 1688.\n\nNevertheless, the Orthodox Church opposed the changes and the Metropolitan printing presses continued to print Church Slavonic books until 1731 in Moldavia and 1745 in Wallachia.\n\nCoresi, the printer of the first Romanian-language book, saw in 1564 no good in the usage of Old Church Slavonic as a liturgical language, as the priests speak to the people in a foreign language, arguing that all the other peoples have the word of God in their language, except for the Romanians. Dimitrie Cantemir, a Moldavian scholar who published the first novel in Romanian, saw the usage of Old Church Slavonic as a \"barbarism\", which caused a cultural regression.\n\nHowever, there were some cultural accomplishments done in the Old Church Slavonic language, such as a number of chronicles and historiographical works in Moldavia or Neagoe Basarab's Teachings to his son Theodosie.\n\n\n"}

It is similar to the slang word \"guesstimate\", a portmanteau of \"guess\" and \"estimate\".\n\nThe slang term \"SWAG\" is generally thought to have originated in the US military, either the Army or the Air Force. Journalist Melvin J. Lasky wrote that it was first used casually by US Army General William Westmoreland during the Vietnam War. Westmoreland would sometimes reply \"SWAG\" to reporters' questions about American failure to neutralize the enemy. Westmoreland's use of the term was affirmed in court by Colonel John Frank Stewart in November 1984 during witness testimony for the lawsuit initiated by Westmoreland against CBS for their TV documentary \"The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception\". On the witness stand, Stewart explained that in Vietnam, the military intelligence branch that he commanded would deliver numbers of enemy strength to Westmoreland, the numbers derived from \"the SWAG principle\". There was laughter in the court when Stewart explained what was meant by the acronym \"SWAG\".\n\nAn earlier use of term is mentioned by linguist J. Robert Dumouchel who wrote the 1975 book, \"Dictionary of Development Terminology\". Dumouchel says he first encountered SWAG \"in the vernacular of community development\" in the US in the 1960s.\n\nRegardless of its origin, the term gained greater prominence in the first half of 1999 in connection with the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Reporter John F. Harris of the \"Washington Post\" was the first person to put the term into a newspaper article. Describing the factors that led to President Bill Clinton relying on the US Air Force in Kosovo instead of employing \"200,000 NATO troops\", Harris wrote that NATO's estimate requiring 200,000 ground troops was regarded by American war planners as politically impossible to achieve; it was quickly removed from consideration. \"NATO's analysis, officials said, was not a comprehensive study. Instead, it was an initial review that some officials called a 'SWAG'—military parlance for a 'scientific wild-ass guess.'\"\n\nSWAG is used to describe an estimate derived from a combination of factors including past experience, general impressions, and heuristic or approximate calculations rather than an exhaustive search, proof, or rigorous calculation. The SWAG is an educated guess but is not regarded as the best or most accurate estimate. The SWAG is not computed or proven rigorously, but the proponent asserts his or her own judgement suffices to rationalize the estimate; and it may, in time, be viable to produce a rigorous forecast of increased precision.\n\nVarious other backronyms of \"SWAG\" have been published, including \"sophisticated wild-ass guess\", \"Silly Wild-Ass Guess\", \"Semi-Wild-Ass Guess\", \"Stupid Wild-Ass Guess\", and \"Scientific Wildly Aimed Guess\". \"Scientific\" implies that the \"guess\" can be justified if necessary or cost-effective. A guess of lesser worth may be called the \"Wild-Ass Guess\" or \"WAG\", and an even rougher estimate may be called \"Back of the Envelope\" (BOTE).\n\n"}

As opposed to the first, primary succession, secondary succession is a process started by an event (e.g. forest fire, harvesting, hurricane, etc.) that reduces an already established ecosystem (e.g. a forest or a wheat field) to a smaller population of species, and as such secondary succession occurs on preexisting soil whereas primary succession usually occurs in a place lacking soil. Many factors can affect secondary succession, such as trophic interaction, initial composition, and competition-colonization trade-offs. The factors that control the increase in abundance of a species during succession may be determined mainly by seed production and dispersal, micro climate; landscape structure (habitat patch size and distance to outside seed sources); bulk density, pH, and soil texture (sand and clay).\n\nSimply put, secondary succession is the ecological succession that occurs after the initial succession has been disrupted and some plants and animals still exist. It is usually faster than primary succession \n\n\"Imperata\" grasslands are caused by human activities such as logging, forest clearing for shifting cultivation, agriculture and grazing, and also by frequent fires. The latter is a frequent result of human interference. However, when not maintained by frequent fires and human disturbances, they regenerate naturally and speedily to secondary young forest. The time of succession in \"Imperata\" grassland (for example in Samboja Lestari area), \"Imperata cylindrica\" has the highest coverage but it becomes less dominant from the fourth year onwards. While \"Imperata\" decreases, the percentage of shrubs and young trees clearly increases with time. In the burned plots, \"Melastoma malabathricum, Eupatorium inulaefolium, Ficus\" sp., and \"Vitex pinnata\". strongly increase with the age of regeneration, but these species are commonly found in the secondary forest.\n\nSoil properties change during secondary succession in Imperata grassland area. The effects of secondary succession on soil are strongest in the A-horizon (0–10 cm), where an increase in carbon stock, N, and C/N ratio, and a decrease in bulk density and pH are observed. Soil carbon stocks also increase upon secondary succession from \"Imperata\" grassland to secondary forest.\nA classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire. Wildfires will burn most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area. Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground in the form of ash. Thus, even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires, the area will soon be ready for new life to take hold. Before the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. Their height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. After the fire, though, these trees are no longer dominant. Thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species. Due to, at least in part, changes in the environment brought on by the growth of the grasses and other species, over many years, shrubs will emerge along with small pine, oak, and hickory trees. These organisms are called intermediate species. Eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire. This equilibrium state is referred to as the climax community, which will remain stable until the next disturbance.\n\nGeneration of carbonates from burnt plant material following fire disturbance causes an initial increase in soil pH that can affect the rate of secondary succession, as well as what types of organisms will be able to thrive. Soil composition prior to fire disturbance also influences secondary succession, both in rate and type of dominant species growth. For example, high sand concentration was found to increase the chances of primary \"Pteridium\" over \"Imperata\" growth in \"Imperata\" grassland. The byproducts of combustion have been shown to affect secondary succession by soil microorganisms. For example, certain fungal species such as \"Trichoderma polysporum\" and \"Penicillium janthinellum\" have a significantly decreased success rate in spore germination within fire-affected areas, reducing their ability to recolonize.\n\nVegetation structure is affected by fire. In some types of ecosystems this creates a process of renewal. Following a fire, early successional species disperse and establish first. This is then followed by late successional species. Species that are fire intolerant are those that are more flammable and are desolated by fire. More tolerant species are able to survive or disperse in the event of fire. The occurrence of fire leads to the establishment of deadwood and snags in forests. This creates habitat and resources for a variety of species.\nFire can act as a seed dispersing stimulant. Many species require fire events to reproduce, disperse, and establish. For example, the knobcone pine (\"Pinus attenuata\") has closed cones that open for dispersal when exposed to heat caused by forest fires. This particular conifer grows in clusters because of this limited method of seed dispersal. A tough fire resistant outer bark and lack of low branches help the knobcone pine survive fire with minimal damage.\n"}
{"id": "460100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=460100", "title": "Semi-automatic pistol", "text": "Semi-automatic pistol\n\nA semi-automatic pistol is a type of pistol that is semi-automatic, meaning it uses the energy of the fired cartridge to cycle the action of the firearm and advance the next available cartridge into position for firing. One cartridge is fired each time the trigger of a semi-automatic pistol is pulled; the pistol's \"disconnector\" ensures this behavior.\n\nAdditional terms sometimes used as synonyms for a semi-automatic pistol are automatic pistol, self-loading pistol, autopistol, and autoloading pistol.\n\nA semi-automatic pistol harnesses the energy of one shot to reload the chamber for the next. After a round is fired, the spent casing is ejected and a new round from the magazine is loaded into the chamber, allowing another shot to be fired as soon as the trigger is pulled again. Most pistols use recoil operation to do this, but some pistols use blowback or gas operation.\n\nMost types of semi-automatic pistols rely on a removable magazine to store ammunition before it is fired, usually inserted inside the grip.\n\nSemi-automatic pistols use one firing chamber that remains fixed in a constant linear position relative to the gun barrel. In contrast, although double-action revolvers can also be fired semiautomatically, their rounds are not fired from a single chamber, but rather are fired from each of the chambers that are rotated into linear alignment with the barrel's position in turn just prior for each shot fired.\n\nTypically, the first round is manually loaded into the chamber by pulling back and releasing the slide mechanism. After the trigger is pulled and the round is fired, the recoil operation of the handgun automatically extracts and ejects the shell casing and reloads the chamber. This mode of operation generally allows for faster reloading and storing a larger number of cartridges than a revolver.\n\nSome modern semi-automatic pistols are double action only (DA or DAO); that is, once a round is chambered, each trigger pull cocks the hammer, striker, or firing pin, and additionally releases the same to fire a cartridge in one continuous motion. Each pull of the trigger on a DAO semi-automatic pistol requires the same amount of pressure. The Kel-Tec P-32 is an example of a DAO action. DAO semi-automatic pistols are most generally recommended only in the smaller, self-defense, concealable pistols, rather than in target or hunting pistols. A notable exception is Glock-brand pistols which optimize preset triggers (similar to DAO), but the striker is partially cocked back as the slide closes. This allows for significantly shorter trigger pulls than DAO. The trigger spring can be replaced with a lighter one and paired with a low-strength sear connector resulting in lightened trigger pulls to improve a shooter's accuracy (like models G34 and G35).\n\nStandard modern semi-automatic pistols are usually double action (DA), also sometimes known as double-action/single-action (DA/SA). In this design, the hammer or striker may be either thumb-cocked or activated by pulling the trigger when firing the first shot. The hammer or striker is recocked automatically during each firing cycle. In double-action pistols, the first pull of the trigger requires roughly twice as much pressure as subsequent firings, since the first pull of the trigger also cocks the hammer (if not already cocked by hand). The Beretta 92F/FS, a full-sized, service, semi-automatic pistol is an example of this style of action. A common mode of carry for DA semi-automatic pistols is with the magazine full, a round chambered, and the gun holstered and uncocked with the external safety unengaged or off. The Taurus PT145 is an example of a (DA/SA) weapon, as it has no decocker and thus has its striker primed from the moment of chambering and only enters double-action mode if a round fails to fire upon the pin's impact; at other times, it operates as a single-action striker fired firearm.\n\nIn contrast, a single-action (SA) semi-automatic pistol must be cocked by first operating the slide or bolt, or, if a round is already chambered, by cocking the hammer manually. The famed Colt M1911 is an example of this style of action. All SA semi-automatic pistols exhibit this feature, and automatically cock the hammer when the slide is first \"racked\" to chamber a round. A round can also be manually inserted in the chamber with the slide locked back. Then the safety can be applied.\n\nThe normal mode of carrying an SA semi-automatic pistol is condition 1, popularly known as cocked and locked. Condition 1 (a term popularized by Colonel Jeff Cooper) refers to having the magazine full, a round chambered, the hammer fully cocked, and the thumb safety engaged or on, at least for right-handed users. For many single-action, semi-automatic pistols, this procedure works well only for right-handed users, as the thumb safety is located on the left side of pistol and is easily accessible only for those who are holding the pistol in the right hand. Many modern SA semi-automatic pistols have had their safety mechanisms redesigned to provide a thumb safety on both sides of the pistol (ambidextrous), thereby better meeting the needs of left-handed, as well as right-handed users.\n\nMany SA semi-automatic pistols have a hammer position known as \"half-cocked\". Squeezing the trigger will not fire the gun when it is in the half-cocked position, and neither will dropping the gun in this state cause an accidental discharge. During WWII in the Pacific Theater, an unofficial and unapproved carry mode for the SA M1911 by left-handed US soldiers in combat was carrying the gun with the magazine full, a round chambered, the action in half-cocked position, and the thumb safety (accessible only to right-handed users) positioned in the off (or ready-to-fire) mode.\n\nThe primary advantage of the half-cocked position versus the uncocked position in that particular scenario was added sound suppression (of the click of the weapon being cocked). A secondary advantage was the avoidance of accidental discharges if the gun were accidentally dropped. The half cock was revised by Colt in the 1970s and subsequently other manufacturers – the hammer will fall from half cock if the trigger is pulled on most newer 1911 type guns.\n\nThe language surrounding automatic, semi-automatic, self-loading, etc., often causes confusion due to differences in technical usage between different countries and differences in popular usage. For example, the term \"automatic pistol\" technically refers to a machine pistol which is capable of firing multiple round bursts for a single pull of the trigger, although in popular US usage it is also used as a synonym for a semi-automatic pistol. In the case of pistols, an 'automatic pistol', a 'semi-automatic pistol', or a 'self-loading pistol', all usually imply a handgun that is semi-automatic, self-loading, and magazine-fed with a magazine that is removable, producing one shot fired for each trigger pull. The term pistol may refer to handguns in general, or may be used to differentiate (semi-automatic) pistols from revolvers.\n\nA self-loading pistol reloads the chamber with a new round automatically each time the weapon is fired, without additional action being required by the user. For a semi-automatic pistol, this is typically accomplished by recoil operation. In a machine pistol, in contrast, this can be accomplished by blowback, or, less commonly, by gas operation, harnessing gases produced when the gun is fired. The Desert Eagle is a rare example of a semi-automatic pistol that siphons off some of the gases instead of relying on short recoil operation.\n\nA revolver, which uses multiple chambers and a single barrel, and a derringer, which uses multiple chambers and multiple barrels, also fire one round per trigger pull, but achieve this in different ways and as such are not classified as being semi-automatic.\n\nA semi-automatic pistol will fire only one shot per trigger pull, in contrast to a \"fully automatic\" or machine pistol, which continues to fire as long as the trigger is held or until all rounds have been fired. The Mauser M712 Schnellfeuer (German for \"rapid fire\"), a modified Mauser C96 pistol, is a notable example of a true machine pistol.\n\nWhile both types of weapons operate on the same principles, fully automatic weapons must be built more ruggedly to accommodate the heat and stress caused by rapid firing, and it can be difficult (and illegal in most countries) to convert a semi-automatic pistol into a fully automatic mode of fire. A selective-fire action pistol, though, can be converted back and forth by means of a switch, and often includes a burst mode, typically for a three-round burst with each trigger pull. Selective-fire weapons are generally used by specialized law enforcement and security personnel such as SWAT teams, hostage rescue teams, antiterrorist units, or government bodyguards for heads of state. In the United States, selective-fire weapons are not available to civilians unless they live in a state that allows civilian ownership of National Firearms Act or Title II weapons.\n\nSelf-loading automatic pistols can be divided into \"blowback\" and \"locked breech\" categories according to their principle of operation. The blowback operating principle is suitable for smaller, lower-powered calibers, such as .32 ACP and .380 ACP, as the resistance of the recoil spring and mass of the slide are sufficient to retard the opening of the breech until the projectile has left the barrel, and breech pressure has dropped to a safe level. For more powerful calibers such as the 9 mm Parabellum (9 mm) and .45 ACP, some form of locked breech is needed to retard breech opening, as an unlocked blowback pistol in these calibers requires a very heavy slide and stiff spring, making them bulky, heavy, and difficult to operate. A somewhat commercially successful blowback pistol design in the more powerful calibers was produced; the Spanish Astra 400 in 9 mm Largo and the similar Astra 600 in 9 mm Parabellum. U.S. manufacturer Hi-Point also produces a line of blowback-operated pistols in several calibers, including 9 mm and .45 ACP. Virtually all other service-caliber pistols are locked-breech designs.\n\nAfter Hiram Maxim introduced his recoil-powered machine gun in 1883, several gunsmiths set out to apply the same principles to handguns, including Maxim. Maxim's designs for smaller firearms using his recoil-powered ideas never went into production.\n\nIn the 1880s, other designers worked on self-loading designs. The Schönberger-Laumann 1892 was the first semi-automatic pistol.\n\nThe first model to gain any commercial success was Hugo Borchardt's C-93, which, together with the 7.65 mm Borchardt cartridge, had been designed in 1893 and made its public debut in 1894. Borchardt based the principle of the C-93's mechanism in large part upon Maxim's toggle-lock. The C-93 featured a locking mechanism modeled after the human knee, which is called \"Kniegelenk\" in German (knee joint). The C-93 proved mechanically reliable, but was too large and bulky to receive widespread acceptance. Equipped with a screw-on wooden stock, the C-93 served well as a small pistol carbine.\n\nIn 1896, Paul Mauser introduced the first model of his Mauser \"Broomhandle\" semi-automatic pistol, the C96. This was the first mass-produced and commercially successful pistol to have a large-capacity, staggered-column magazine holding 10 or 20 rounds.\nIts original cartridge was called 7.63 mm Mauser, which was more powerful but otherwise identical to the 7.65 mm Borchardt.\nThe Mauser was one of the first self-loading pistols used extensively in battle, notably the South African War of 1899-1902. These pistols were made in 7.63 mm Mauser, or 9×25 mm Mauser, along with some models eventually being made in 9 mm Parabellum and a small number in .45 ACP for China.\n\n1898 saw the Schwarzlose Model 1898, a semi-automatic pistol invented by Prussian firearm designer Andreas Wilhelm Schwarzlose. It was chambered for the 7.65×25mm Mauser,[1] but could also shoot the weaker Borchardt ammunition. The Schwarzlose design was most advanced and far ahead of its time, but not widely adopted with less than 1000 pieces being manufactured.[2][3]\nSmall lots were sold to the Boers and used during the Boer War. Another lot was sold to members of the Russian Social-Democratic Party who were plotting insurrection, but were confiscated at the Russian border and issued to the Imperial Russian Frontier Guards.[3][4]\n\nIn Belgium in 1896 American gun designer John Browning developed self-loading semi-automatic pistols. His models were first manufactured in Europe by the Belgian firm of Fabrique Nationale (FN) and later by Colt in the U.S.\nBrowning's first successful design was the Browning M1900.\nLike Georg Luger's work conducted around the same time in Germany, it was desiged alongside a in 7.65 mm cartridge, but the 7.65 mm Browning (aka .32 Auto) differs substantially from Luger's 7.65 mm Parabellum. Browning went on to design .25, .38, .380, and .45 ACP cartridges for his semi-automatic pistol designs.\n\nBrowning must be given credit for developing the type of locked-breech action which is commonly used by the vast majority of modern large caliber semi-automatic pistols. \n\nOne of Browning's most enduring designs was the Colt M1911, which was adopted by the U.S. military as its service pistol and is still in active use with some U.S. Special Forces and Marine Corps units.\n\nBrowning also co-designed the FN Browning Hi-Power, announced in 1922, during the last years of his life, working on this design until his death in 1926. This was a 9 mm Luger semi-automatic pistol capable of holding 13 rounds in the magazine (plus one chambered).\nA staggered magazine had already been realized in the Savage Model 1907 with 10-rounds of .32 ACP. \nThis predates the filing of Browning's patent for the large-capacity 9 mm pistol [6-28-1923, issued as U.S. patent #1,618,510, dated 22 Feb. 1927] by some 18 years as the Savage was patented in 1905,\nWhether the staggered magazine featured in the Savage 1905 was a focal point of the patent is unclear. In a review of the Browning patent dated 22 Feb. 1927, it is equally unclear if the staggered magazine is a primary or a dependent claim of the patent as issued. However, the existence of a staggered magazine in 1905 is indisputable, as many of these Savage pistols were produced and survive to this day. Browning could well have come into contact with this concept during the military trials of 1911, as a version of the Savage design in .45 cal was also under consideration alongside the Browning/Colt design.) \n\nThe next notable design was the 7.65 mm Luger by Georg Luger, which although successful in its function, nonetheless failed to have adequate stopping power and failed to win widespread acceptance. In 1902, Luger's subsequent and similar P08 in 9 mm Parabellum overcame the problem of inadequate stopping power and featured a greatly improved Borchardt-type \"Kniegelenk\" (\"knee-joint\") locking mechanism. Unlike Browning's locked-breech design, the barrel in a \"Kniegelenk\" design does not tip up and down while the gun is fired, thereby theoretically improving shooting accuracy. Luger's P.08 was adopted by the German military and served as their standard sidearm in World War I.\n\nDuring World War II, Germany was the first nation to adopt a double-action pistol, the Walther P38, which could be carried loaded (with a cartridge chambered) and ready to fire without the risk of an accidental discharge if dropped. The P38 also used Luger's 9 mm Parabellum cartridge.\n\nDuring World War II, revolvers were still issued by various major powers, but their use was decreasing. Though the British firm Webley & Scott had developed several adequate self-loading pistols, one of which was adopted by the (normally unarmed) British police in 1911 and by the Royal Navy and Royal Marines before the First World War, revolvers were generally preferred by most British military. In the Soviet Union, the TT pistol replaced the Nagant M1895 revolver during the war. In the United States, the M1911A1 was adopted as the standard military sidearm. Both Colt and Smith & Wesson produced revolvers chambered for the same .45 ACP ammunition used in the M1911A1, because of the great demand for handguns and the need to adopt a common cartridge for use in both semi-automatic pistols and revolvers.\n\nAfter World War II, most nations eventually adopted 9 mm Parabellum caliber pistols employing some variant of Browning's locked-breech design for their standard-issue military pistols. The most popular early choice was the FN Browning Hi-Power mentioned above; another popular model was the locked-breech Walther P38 because of its many safety features. , the U.S. military sidearm is a variant of the Beretta 92F/FS.\n\n\nAfter the Second World War, the almost universal trend has been for semi-automatic pistols to replace revolvers for military use, although the transition has been slower in police and civilian use. , revolvers are mainly used in jurisdictions which permit their use for civilian self-defense, hunting, plinking, and target practice. Semi-automatic pistols are by far the most popular for concealed carry by civilians, primary handguns for police and military use, backup guns for police use, and where the usual five or six shots of a revolver are deemed inadequate.\n\n\n"}

Many couples that would not consider themselves active in BDSM are familiar with this kind of play: the use of silk scarves, feathers, ice, massage oils, and other similar implements.\n\nSensation play in BDSM can also involve sadomasochistic play, involving the application of \"carefully controlled\" stimuli to the human body so that it reacts as if it were actually hurt. While this can involve the infliction of actual pain, it is usually done in order to release pleasurable endorphins, creating a sensation somewhat like runner's high or the afterglow of orgasm, sometimes called \"flying\" or \"body stress\".\nIn BDSM play, the top (or dominant) introduces and controls the sensation to the bottom (or submissive).\n\n\nThe sensation can come from just about anywhere, provided that the implement and its use fall within the negotiated terms of the interaction or relationship.

{"id": "18267750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18267750", "title": "Singdarin", "text": "Singdarin\n\nColloquial Singaporean Mandarin, also known as Singdarin () is an interlanguage native to Singapore. In Taiwan, this language variety is known as Singnese (). It is based on Mandarin but has a large amount of English in its vocabulary. For this reason, Singdarin is sometimes known as \"Anglo-Chinese\". There are also words from Malay and other Chinese dialects.\n\nIn general, well-educated Chinese Singaporeans are able to code-switch between Singdarin and Standard Mandarin.\n\nSingdarin grammar is usually identical to Mandarin. In some circumstances, there is code-switching with English. Singdarin vocabulary consists of a large number of words from English, Hokkien, and Malay, among other languages, often when speakers do not know the Mandarin equivalent of what they wish to express, and instead use English words to convey the meaning.\n\nIt is almost identical to the Colloquial Malaysian Mandarin spoken in Malaysia, while native Chinese from China or native Taiwanese from Taiwan generally find it difficult to understand Singdarin due to large number of English or non-Mandarin words used. The Singaporean government currently discourages the use of Singdarin in favour of Standard Singaporean Mandarin as it believes in the need for Singaporeans to be able to communicate effectively with native Chinese from China or Taiwan.\n\nLike its Singlish equivalent, Singdarin evolved because many Singaporean Chinese families come from mixed language environments. For instance, children may be raised in households in which one parent speaks English while the other speaks Chinese or coming for other Chinese dialects, such as Hokkien or Cantonese respectively.\n\nSingdarin has also evolved largely because Singapore is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-lingual society. One of the most important policies of the Singaporean government is to ensure social and multi-ethnic harmony. Therefore, instead of letting certain ethnic groups to live in an isolated community like they did in the past, the Singapore government encourages the majority of Singaporeans to live in HDB flats that have now become a melting pot of Chinese, Malays, Indians and other different ethnicity who speak different languages. This is believed to reduce differences between the diverse linguistic and ethnic groups in Singapore.\n\nAs the majority of Singaporeans live in HDB flats, which have families coming from various linguistic, racial and ethnic background, there is a tendency for different languages to be mixed in order to facilitate more effective communication between the different races. In short, it leads to the creation of a hybrid culture (known colloquially as a \"rojak\" culture).\n\nThis and the tendency for the Singaporean Chinese people to use the mixed language that they use at home in daily colloquial conversation has since influenced the Mandarin spoken in schools, resulting in \"Singdarin\" being formed. It was in this environment that Singdarin developed.\n\nBelow are some examples of Singdarin dialogue spoken amongst some Chinese Singaporeans.\n\nThe following are the common English loan words used in Singdarin.\n\nJust like Singlish, certain words used in Singlish are also interchangeably used in Singdarin.\n\nSince English is the main working and educational language of Singapore, many Chinese Singaporeans are more familiar with the English professional terminology (technical terms) used at work, rather than that of Mandarin. This led to many Chinese Singaporeans tending to mix large number of English professional terms into Mandarin at work, instead of using Chinese technical terms. As such, a form of Singdarin spoken at work appears, resulting in some degree of communication barrier at work between the Chinese Singaporeans and the Chinese from China or Taiwan.\n\nComparison between Singdarin spoken at work in Singapore and Mandarin spoken at work in China is shown below:\n\nThere are other terms associated with Singdarin such as \"Broken Chinese\", \"Half-bucket\" (半桶水） or \"Half-past Six Chinese\". These are the terms used by Singaporean Chinese-language professionals to refer to the mediocre (or low) proficiency level of [Standard Mandarin] amongst certain Chinese Singaporeans. The terms describe that when measured against Standard Mandarin, certain Chinese Singaporeans are only 50-65% proficient in Mandarin.\n\nPart of the reason for this could be due to the widespread use of Singdarin in Singapore. Singdarin has led to the impression of \"broken Chinese\" or \"bad Chinese\", and is generally considered to be an adulterated form of Mandarin Chinese. Speaking Singdarin, for Singaporeans, is a natural linguistic habit derived from speaking a mixed language in daily life. However, the lower proficiency in formal Mandarin Chinese was mainly due to a lack of practice and exposure to more proper Chinese language, a lack of practice in speaking, hearing, reading and writing Chinese. This further led to a limited Chinese vocabulary or knowledge on Chinese cultural subjects, thus making it difficult for Singdarin speakers to speak Standard Mandarin fluently. Singdarin speakers will generally find it difficult to communicate (at a higher level) when attempting to interact with native Chinese speakers from China or Taiwan.\n\n\n"}

Thereafter, he obtained his master's degree in Bengali from the University of Calcutta in 1954.\n\nHe married Swati Banerjee on 26 February 1967. Their only son, Souvik, who stays in Boston, was born on 20 November 1967.\n\nGangopadhyay was the founder editor of \"Krittibas\", a seminal poetry magazine started publishing from 1953, that became a platform for a new generation of poets experimenting with many new forms in poetic themes, rhythms, and words. o\n\nLater, he started writing for various publications of the Ananda Bazar group, a major publishing house in Kolkata and has been continuing it for many years. He became a friend of the beat poet Allen Ginsberg while he was travelling in India. Ginsberg mentioned Gangopadhyay most notedly in his poem September on Jessore Road. Gangopadhyay in return mentioned Ginsberg in some of his prose work. After serving five years as the Vice President, he was elected the President of the Sahitya Akademi on 20 February 2008\n\nSunil, along with Tarun Sanyal, Jyotirmoy Datta and Satrajit Dutta had volunteered to be defence witnesses in the famous trial of Hungry generation movement poet Malay Roy Choudhury.\n\nAuthor of well over 200 books, Sunil was a prolific writer who has excelled in different genres but declares poetry to be his \"first love\". His \"Nikhilesh\" and \"Neera\" series of poems (some of which have been translated as \"For You, Neera\" and \"Murmur in the Woods\") have been extremely popular.\n\nAs in poetry, Sunil was known for his unique style in prose. His second novel was \"Atmaprakash\" and it was also the first writing from a new comer in literature published in the prestigious magazine- \"Desh\" (1965). It was critically acclaimed but some controversy arose for its aggressive and 'obscene' style. Sunil said that he was afraid of this novel and went away from Calcutta for a few days. Satyajit Ray thought to make a film on it but it wasn't possible for reasons. The central character of 'Atmaprakash' is a young man of core-calcutta'- Sunil, who leads a bohemian life-style. The novel had inspiration from ' On the road' by Jack Kerouac, the beat generation writer. His historical fiction \"Sei Somoy\" (translated into English by Aruna Chakravorty as \"Those Days\") received the Indian Sahitya Akademi award in 1985. \"Sei Somoy\" continues to be a best seller more than two decade after its first publication. The same is true for \"Prothom Alo\" (also translated recently by Aruna Chakravorty as \"First Light\"), another best selling historical fiction and \"Poorba-Pashchim\", a raw depiction of the partition and its aftermath seen through the eyes of three generations of Bengalis in West Bengal, Bangladesh and elsewhere. He is also the winner of the Bankim Puraskar (1982), and the Ananda Puraskar (twice, in 1972 and 1989).\n\nSunil wrote in many other genres including travelogues, children's fiction, short stories, features, and essays. Among his pen-names are: Nil Lohit, Sanatan Pathak, and Nil Upadhyay.\n\nThough he wrote all types of children's fiction, one character created by him that stands out above the rest, was Kakababu, the crippled adventurist, accompanied by his young adult nephew Santu, and his friend Jojo. Since 1974, Sunil Gangopadhyay wrote over 35 novels of this popular series, most of which appeared in Anandamela magazine.\n\n\nSunil Gangopadhyay died at 2:05 AM on 23 October 2012 at his South Kolkata residence, following a heart attack. He was suffering from prostate cancer for some time and went to Mumbai for treatment. He returned to Kolkata on the day of \"Mahalaya\". Although he was a communist and never followed any Hindu practices, Gangopadhyay's body was cremated following Hindu custom on 25 October at \"Keoratola crematorium\" with several dignitaries and numerous fans paying their last tributes.However, Ganguly was an atheist and he never had any belief in any Hindu religious activities.\n\nIndian President Pranab Mukherjee condoled the death of Gangopadhyay saying–\nGangopadhyay had enriched Bengali literature through his unique style. He was one of the best intellectuals among his contemporaries. The vacuum created by his death cannot be filled\n\nBuddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the former Chief Minister of West Bengal, who was closely associated with the writer since 1964, said that Bengali literature would remain indebted to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is difficult and perhaps impossible to translate properly into English. Different authors render it as \"Blessings and good luck\" or \"May all auspicious signs come to this environment\".\n\nTashi delek is traditionally used as part of a larger invocation on Losar. With the Dalai Lama's self-deportation and creation of the Tibetan diaspora, exile authorities promoted the use of \"tashi delek\" as an all-purpose greeting which could be easily picked up by foreign sponsors. Students of the exile school system are taught that this usage of \"tashi delek\" has roots in premodern Tibet, and that Chinese Tibetans' exclusive usage of \"tashi delek\" for New Years' is corrupt. Tour operators have promoted the phrase, along with khata scarves and prayer flags, as essentialized and commodifiable aspects of Tibetan culture, a fact that has caused resentment among some religious Tibetans. \"Tashi Delek\" is the name of a website that provides information on the nation of Bhutan and promotes Tourism.\n\nThe phrase \"Tashi delek\" is also used in the Chinese language with the Chinese transcription \"Zhaxi Dele\" (). There is a song called \"Zhaxi Dele\" with lyrics by Rongzhong Erjia (), a Tibetan, and music by Chang Yingzhong (), a Han Chinese.\n\nThe phrase is also used in Bhutan, regions of Nepal, and Sikkim. There is a company in Bhutan called TashiDelek.com and a Hotel Tashi Delek in Gangtok, Sikkim. The inflight magazine of Bhutanese airline Druk Air is called Tashi Delek.\n\n\n"}
