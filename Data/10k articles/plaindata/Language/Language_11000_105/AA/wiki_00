He grew up bilingual; West Frisian was the community's everyday language, although it was not the culture language, which was, and still is, Dutch. After completing the secondary school Simon Vestdijk in Harns, he studied political science at the University of Amsterdam. At the time, in 1983, this study in Amsterdam still had a Marxist orientation, which would constitute an important influence in life and works of De Vries. While living in Amsterdam, he developed a major interest in literature, particularly in poetry.\n\nAfter his conscription De Vries remained in military service for another six years, now working as a contract-based intelligence-officer. From 1993 until 1996 he studied history in Groningen. His professor Frank Ankersmit, despite being an obvious liberal, had a significant influence on De Vries's thinking, through his intellectual, theoretical approach of historiography.\n\nMeanwhile, De Vries educated the members of the peace keeping force in Bosnia and Croatia about the backgrounds of the conflict in those countries, and he wrote opinion articles on the conflict for every Dutch newspaper. In 1996 he became a journalist for the General Press Bureau Tammeling in Groningen. In 1999, motivated by dissatisfaction with the emotional and biased news coverage, he became a correspondent in Belgrade for the ANP, and the Dutch journals \"Trouw\" and \"Elsevier\". From 2000 until 2006 he was a foreign correspondent for \"Elsevier\". For his assignments he traveled to former Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Poland, Russia, and Afghanistan, as well as other destinations.\n\nIn the early 2000s, De Vries was a contributing poet, and also a member of the editorial staff, for the innovative and wayward literary magazine \"Kistwurk\". In February 2003, De Vries started the literary magazine \"Farsk\", of which he was the chief editor until 2006. He also wrote a one-man magazine on the Internet, Oranzjery De Kopspiker, which, in 2010, was succeeded by the weblog Seedyksterfeartfisk. That has been the leading Frisian literary blog for a number of years, with content that informed the artistic-cultural as well as the environmental activist discourse.\n\nIn the beginning of 2005 he succeeded Jabik Veenbaas as the prose reviewer for the main Frisian newspaper the \"Leeuwarder Courant\". From 2006 until 2011 he was a publisher at the publishing house Friese Pers Boekerij/Noordhoek. Since 2011 he has been associated with the newspaper \"Friesch Dagblad\", first as a review writer for Frisian poetry and essayistic publications, journalist of common cultural topics and columnist of the weekly column \"Skroeier\", and since 2014 also as senior editor.\n\nIn 2015 De Vries, along with Friduwih Riemersma, started the literary magazine \"Fers2\", a digital platform for critical, independent literature and radical literary research.\n\nIn his youth De Vries started writing Dutch poems. In 2002 he made his début in Friesland with the collection \"De weromkommer yn it ûnlân\" (The returner in the nonland). Poems from this collection were published earlier in the Frisian literary magazines \"Trotwaer\", \"Hjir\" en \"Kistwurk\".\n\nIn his early poetry he sought a balance between the present and his lost youth in Winaam, with its related theme of lost love. Eastern Europe was also often a subject in his poems from that period. Later on, love, the search for the significant other, and the finding and subsequent losing of security, came to be the prominent themes for his poetry. In addition, this poetry expresses consideration for the West Frisian language, which is a dying language, and for the history and violation of the North Frisian coastal region, and the marginal position of the Frisian speaking artist. De Vries's lyrical poetry shows the development from primarily image-focused poems toward a broader, more narrative poetic style, in which the music of language has been given ample scope.\n\nIn 2005 De Vries received the Gysbert Japicx Award for his second collection \"In waarm wek altyd\" (A warm ice-hole forever). As a result, he was the fourth Frisian author, after Trinus Riemersma, Jan Wybenga and Willem Abma, who was awarded for a young oeuvre; there had never been such a short time between the start of the profession in the belles-lettres and receiving the Gysbert Japicx Award, as in the case of awarding the prize to De Vries.\n\nIn January 2013 the sixth collection was published, \"Ravensulver/Ravenzilver\" (Ravensilver). The seventh collection, \"Brek dyn klank\" (Missing your sound) came two years later, in 2015. \"Brek dyn klank\" further examines post-modern uprooted relationships, but from a more delicate perspective, and more drawn from experience than the earlier works, while at the same time preserving the classical form.\n\nDe Vries is also one of the main essay writers in Friesland. Several of his essays have found their way as introductions to anthologies or omnibus volumes. The essay collections about the Frisian literature, \"Identiteit & kowesturten\" (Identity & cow tails, 2008), \"Erfskip & krisis\" (Heritage & crisis, 2015), and \"Winternocht & moannereis\" (Winter joy & moon journey, forthcoming), are an idiosyncratic mix of empirical literary history, philosophical cultural criticism, and personal reflection on his own roots. These diverse aspects are connected by a strong engagement. Furthermore, the last collection, \"Winternocht & moannereis\", aims at the decanonization of the nineteenth-century Frisian literature.\n\nThe photo works explore the interface between documentary photography and art photography. The Frisian landscape frequently is the subject and the muse. Some series were shown in gallery exhibitions; other photo series were published in photography books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The shape of the vocal tract can be controlled in a number of ways which usually involves modifying the position of the speech articulators, such as the tongue, jaw, and lips. Speech is created by digitally simulating the flow of air through the representation of the vocal tract.\n\nThere is a long history of attempts to build mechanical \"talking heads.\"\n\nThe first electrical vocal tract analogs were static, like those of Dunn (1950), Ken Stevens and colleagues (1953), Gunnar Fant (1960). Rosen (1958) built a dynamic vocal tract (DAVO), which Dennis (1963) later attempted to control by computer. Dennis et al. (1964), Hiki et al. (1968) and Baxter and Strong (1969) have also described hardware vocal-tract analogs. Kelly and Lochbaum (1962) made the first computer simulation; later digital computer simulations have been made, e.g. by Nakata and Mitsuoka (1965), Matsui (1968) and Paul Mermelstein (1971). Honda et al. (1968) have made an analog computer simulation.\n\nThe first software articulatory synthesizer regularly used for laboratory experiments was developed at Haskins Laboratories in the mid-1970s by Philip Rubin, Tom Baer, and Paul Mermelstein. This synthesizer, known as ASY, was a computational model of speech production based on vocal tract models developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1960s and 1970s by Paul Mermelstein, Cecil Coker, and colleagues. Another popular model that has been frequently used is that of Shinji Maeda, which uses a factor-based approach to control tongue shape.\n\nRecent progress in speech production imaging, articulatory control modeling, and tongue biomechanics modeling has led to changes in the way articulatory synthesis is performed . Examples include the Haskins CASY model (Configurable Articulatory Synthesis), designed by Philip Rubin, Mark Tiede , and Louis Goldstein , which matches midsagittal vocal tracts to actual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and uses MRI data to construct a 3D model of the vocal tract. A full 3D articulatory synthesis model has been described by Olov Engwall. A geometrically based 3D articulatory speech synthesizer has been developed by Peter Birkholz (VocalTractLab). The Directions Into Velocities of Articulators (DIVA) model, a feedforward control approach which takes the neural computations underlying speech production into consideration, was developed by Frank H. Guenther at Boston University. The ArtiSynth project, headed by Sidney Fels at the University of British Columbia, is a 3D biomechanical modeling toolkit for the human vocal tract and upper airway. Biomechanical modeling of articulators such as the tongue has been pioneered by a number of scientists, including Reiner Wilhelms-Tricarico , Yohan Payan and Jean-Michel Gerard , Jianwu Dang and Kiyoshi Honda .\n\nOne of the few commercial articulatory speech synthesis systems is the NeXT-based system originally developed and marketed by Trillium Sound Research, a spin-off company of the University of Calgary, where much of the original research was conducted. Following the demise of the various incarnations of NeXT (started by Steve Jobs in the late 1980s and merged with Apple Computer in 1997), the Trillium software was published under a GNU General Public Licence, with work continuing as gnuspeech. The system, first marketed in 1994, provides full articulatory-based text-to-speech conversion using a waveguide or transmission-line analog of the human oral and nasal tracts controlled by Rene Carré's \"distinctive region model\".\n\n\n\n"}

(Silk was occasionally used, but was prohibitively expensive.)\n\nThe earliest surviving examples of wood or bamboo slips date from the 5th century BC during the Warring States period. However, references in earlier texts surviving on other media make it clear that some precursor of these Warring States period bamboo slips was in use as early as the late Shang period (from about 1250 BC). Bamboo or wooden strips were the standard writing material during the Han dynasty and excavated examples have been found in abundance. Subsequently, the invention of paper by Cai Lun during the Han dynasty began to displace bamboo and wooden strips from mainstream uses, and by the 4th century AD bamboo had been largely abandoned as a medium for writing in China.\n\nThe long, narrow strips of wood or bamboo typically carry a single column of brush-written text each, with space for several tens of visually complex ancient Chinese characters. Each strip of wood or bamboo is said to be as long as a chopstick and as wide as two. For longer texts, many slips were sewn together used to make a kind of folding book.\n\nThe custom of interring books made of the durable bamboo strips in royal tombs has preserved many works in their original form through the centuries. An important early find was the Jizhong discovery in 279 AD of a tomb of a king of Wei, though the original recovered strips have since disappeared. Several caches of great importance have been found in recent years.\n\nThe Shanghai Museum corpus was purchased in Hong Kong the year after the Guodian tomb was excavated, and is believed to have been taken by tomb robbers from a tomb in the same area. The Tsinghua collection was donated by an alumnus who purchased it through auction, with no indication of its origin. The others are archaeologically excavated.\n\nOne accoutrement used when writing on bamboo slips was a small knife which would be used to scrape away mistakes and make amendments. Decorated knives became a symbol of office for some officials indicating their power to amend and change records and edicts.\n"}

Uses include filling, spacing, joining, or reinforcing members. Blocking is typically made from short off-cuts or defective, warped pieces of lumber. The term \"Blocking\" is also sometimes used by people in construction to refer to discontinuous shims or spacers. Names for similar materials in other forms of English include dwang, nog, noggin, and nogging.\n\nSome blocking is used structurally like cross bracing between joists in a subfloor to prevent buckling and stiffen the floor. This use is also called \"block bridging\", \"solid bridging\", and \"solid strutting\".\n\nFire-blocking is a firestop.\n\n\"Blocks\" are spacers between studs such as where an interior wall attaches an exterior wall and for framing corners such as a \"three-stud corner with blocking\".\n\nBlocking is used for panel edge supports such as sheets of drywall or plywood also called \"back blocking\"\n\nBlocking, often called \"backing\" or sometimes \"grounds\", also refers to pieces of wood or other material that run between wall studs in order to provide support and attachment sites for mounted hardware or trim such as cabinets, shelving, handrails, vanity tops without a cabinet underneath, bathroom towel bars, mouldings etc. Properly installed blocking is easier to find and use for attaching wall hardware than studs alone. Once drywall, or any other material, covers the wall it can be difficult to find 2x4 studs for attachment, and the position of nails and screws must be adjusted to stud location. Thus, if blocking is installed at a uniform and predetermined height, attachment sites can be found without using a stud finder, and the blocking can be utilized anywhere along a wall at that height. This is particularly useful for installing upper cabinets in kitchens or bathrooms as they tend to be fairly heavy and finding appropriate studs for installation can be difficult.\n"}

He was born in Rouskey, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. He was educated in St Columb's College, Derry, St Patrick's College, Maynooth, and the Pontifical Irish College in Rome.\n\nIn 1958, he became professor of modern languages at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, a position he held until he retired in 1996. On 2 September 2013 he was the principal celebrant at the funeral of the poet Seamus Heaney.\n\nHomily of Monsignor Brendan Devlin at Funeral Mass (02. SEP, 2013)\n\nJust as I hold that it is not for a Christian minister to embark on eulogy or to praise the talents and achievements of those who have gone from us, neither is it for me to audit the virtues and good works of Seamus Heaney, (after all, as Wisdom tells us of great men, “ their good works go before them”.) And yet, when we read that series of sharp witted paradoxes that we call the Eight Beatitudes and which are the core of the Sermon on the Mount, what you might call the identikit portrait of the ideal Christian, it cannot but strike us how many of them apply readily to our memories of Seamus Heaney.\n\n“How blest are those of gentle spirit; those who hunger and thirst to see right prevail; those who show mercy to others; those who want to see peace established.”\n\nHow much of that is a description of the man we knew, of the brilliant literary critic, of the articulater of the years of pain in the North.\n\nBut understand me well, this not my effort to recuperate him, as the French say, to harness him in the ranks of the soldiers of Christ. How unsufferably patronising that would be! I think rather of something more deep-seated than such easy conformism. I remember something he wrote a lifetime ago when he recalled the early stirrings of a poetic imagination as he recited as an altar boy the words of the Litany: “Mystical Rose, Tower of David, Tower of Ivory, House of Gold, Ark of the Covenant, Morning Star.” I too recall such stirrings at devotions in the twilight of a May evening. Like many of our generation we had both inherited, he on the plains of South Derry, I in the hills of Tyrone, the imagination and with it the memory of a community. What was important was not so much the prayers we did or did not say as the prayers that had been said before us for generations, generations whose hard won loyalties were so authentically embodied in the man and so vibrantly expressed in his work.\n\nTherefore as we commend Seamus Heaney to the mercy of the Lord, which is the primary purpose of a Catholic funeral Mass, we do so in the faith and hope of an age-old community, who lived their lives and died their death in the Lord Jesus and who, still living in that same Lord, await us their descendants and heirs in that eternal life which we hold to be sealed in us by our common baptism.\n\nIn that sense, all of us have long since been given to God by our forefathers in the Faith and by the hope which nourished them and which they looked to see fulfilled in us. The Gospel of Saint John quotes Jesus as saying: “Everyone the Father gives me will come to me, and anyone who comes to me I will not cast out,” and as repeating: “Father, of those you have given me I have not lost anyone.”\n\nIn our natural consternation in the presence of death and the termination of our earthly supports, we can only turn our eyes on life in that spirit of Christian optimism which, it seems to me, breathes in much of the work of Seamus Heaney and which I believe to be his inheritance from our troubled past.\n\nIt was in similarly troubling circumstances, as the shadows of evening descended on that Upper Room of the Last Supper that Christ’s disciples heard him speak the words that we have just read in the Gospel. Amid the foreboding of those last days in the life of Jesus with their crowding events, commands and prophecies, they were urged by their Lord to overcome their sorrow through a renewal of their faith and trust in God.\n\n“Let not your hearts be troubled,” He said. “I go to prepare a place for you and if I do so, I will come back to bring you with me, so that where I am, you also may be. And as for the way there, I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. “\n\nAs we part from Seamus Heaney for a while and send him from us on that way, what our forefathers called “slí na firinne”, we accompany him in faith and hope and with the viaticum of our prayers.\n\nDevlin is an accomplished polyglot and popular teacher who is particularly known for his work in French and in Irish. For many years, he was rector of the Irish College in Paris and has also published three novels in Irish: \"Néal Maidine agus Tine Oíche\" (1964), \"An Branar gan Cur\" (1979) and \"Sliocht ar Thír na Scáth\" (2018). He has also published translations from French into Irish by La Fontaine, Pascal and Saint-Euxperry. He translated several books of the Bible into Irish.\n\nIn 2001, Devlin was invested as an Officer of the Légion d'honneur, the highest French award available to a foreign national.\n"}

Languages without character data types (like Python or PHP) will typically use strings of length 1 to serve the same purpose a character data type would fulfil. This simplifies the implementation and basic usage of a language but also introduces new scope for programming errors.\n\nA common convention for expressing a character literal is to use a single quote (codice_1) for character literals, as contrasted by the use of a double quote (codice_2) for string literals. For example, codice_3 indicates the single character codice_4 while codice_5 indicates the string codice_4 of length 1.\n\nThe representation of a character within the computer memory, in storage, and in data transmission, is dependent on a particular character encoding scheme. For example, an ASCII (or extended ASCII) scheme will use a single byte of computer memory, while a UTF-8 scheme will use one or more bytes, depending on the particular character being encoded.\n\nAlternative ways to encode character values include specifying an integer value for a code point, such as an ASCII code value or a Unicode code point. This may be done directly via converting an integer literal to a character, or via an escape sequence.\n\n"}
{"id": "547964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=547964", "title": "Classical Arabic", "text": "Classical Arabic\n\nClassical Arabic is the form of the Arabic language used in Umayyad and Abbasid literary texts from the 7th century AD to the 9th century AD.\n\nThe orthography of the Qurʾān was not developed for the standardized form of Classical Arabic.\n\nModern Standard Arabic (MSA) is its direct descendant used today throughout the Arab world in writing and in formal speaking, for example, prepared speeches, some radio broadcasts, and non-entertainment content; it is also used in modernized versions of the Quran and revised editions of poetries and novels from Umayyad and Abbasid times (7th to 9th centuries). While the lexis and stylistics of Modern Standard Arabic are different from Classical Arabic, the morphology and syntax have remained basically unchanged (though MSA uses a subset of the syntactic structures available in CA). In the Arab world, little distinction is made between CA and MSA, and both are normally called \"al-fuṣḥá\" (‎) in Arabic, meaning 'the most eloquent'.\n\nIn the late 6th century AD, a relatively uniform intertribal ‘poetic koiné’ distinct from the spoken vernaculars developed based on the Bedouin dialects of Najd, probably in connection with the Lakhmid court of al-Ḥīra. During the first Islamic century the majority of Arabic poets and Arabic-writing persons spoke a form of Arabic as their mother tongue. Their texts, although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts, contain traces of non-standardized Classical Arabic elements in morphology and syntax. The standardization of Classical Arabic reached completion around the end of the 8th century. The first comprehensive description of the \"ʿarabiyya\" \"Arabic\", Sībawayhi's \"al\"-\"Kitāb\", is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts, in addition to the Qurʾān and Bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the \"ʿarabiyya\". \"Colloquial\" Arabic refers to the many regional dialects derived from Arabic spoken daily across the region and learned as a first language, and as second language if people speak other languages native to their particular country. By the 8th century, knowledge of Classical Arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the Islamic world, as it was the lingua franca across the Middle East, North Africa, Horn of Africa during those times; the analogy is like most literate Romance speakers were also literate in Classical Latin. Various Arabic dialects freely borrowed words from Classical Arabic, this situation is similar to Romance languages, wherein scores of words were borrowed directly from Classical Latin. People speak Classical Arabic as a second language if they speak colloquial Arabic dialects as their first language, but as a third language if others speak other languages native to a country as their first language and colloquial Arabic dialects as their second language. But Classical Arabic was spoken with different pronunciations influenced by informal dialects. The differentiation of the pronunciation of informal dialects is the influence from native languages previously spoken and some presently spoken in the regions, such as Coptic in Egypt, Berber, Punic or Phoenician in North Africa, Himyaritic, Modern South Arabian and Old South Arabian in Yemen, and Aramaic in the Levant.\n\nLike Modern Standard Arabic, Classical Arabic had 28 consonant phonemes:\nNotes:\n\nThe A1 inscription dated to the 3rd or 4th c. AD in the Greek alphabet in a dialect showing affinities to that of the Safaitic inscriptions shows that short final high vowels had been lost in at least some dialects of Old Arabic at that time, obliterating the distinction between nominative and genitive case in the singular, leaving the accusative the only marked case:\n\nأوس (بن) عود (بن) بناء (بن) كازم الإدامي أتو من شحاص؛ أتو بناء الدورة ويرعو بقلة بكانون.\n\n\"ʾAws (ibin) ʿūḏ (?) (ibin) Bannāʾ (ibin) Kazim ʾal-ʾidāmiyy ʾatawa miś-śiḥāṣ; ʾatawa Bannāʾa ʾad-dawra wa yirʿaw baqla bi-kānūn\"\n\n\"ʾAws son of ʿūḏ (?) son of Bannāʾ son of Kazim the ʾidāmite came because of scarcity; he came to Bannāʾ in this region and they pastured on fresh herbage during Kānūn\".\n\nClassical Arabic however, shows a far more archaic system, essentially identical with that of Proto-Arabic:\nThe definite article spread areally among the Central Semitic languages and it would seem that Proto-Arabic lacked any overt marking of definiteness. Besides dialects with no definite article, the Safaitic inscriptions exhibit about four different article forms, ordered by frequency: \"h-\", \"ʾ-\", \"ʾl-\", and \"hn-\". The Old Arabic of the Nabataean inscriptions exhibits almost exclusively the form \"ʾl-\". Unlike the Classical Arabic article, the Old Arabic \"ʾl\" almost never exhibits the assimilation of the coda to the coronals; the same situation is attested in the Graeco-Arabica, but in A1 the coda assimilates to the following \"d\", αδαυρα *\"ʾad-dawra\" 'the region'.\n\nIn Classical Arabic, the definite article takes the form \"ʾal-\", with the coda of the article exhibiting assimilation to the following dental and denti-alveolar consonants. Note the inclusion of palatal , which alone among the palatal consonants exhibits assimilation, indicating that assimilation ceased to be productive before that consonant shifted from Old Arabic :\n\nProto-Central Semitic, Proto-Arabic, various forms of Old Arabic, and some modern Najdi dialects to this day have alternation in the performative vowel of the prefix conjugation, depending on the stem vowel of the verb. Early forms of Classical Arabic allowed this alternation, but later forms of Classical Arabic levelled the /a/ allomorph:\n\n\n"}

Daga is spoken by about 9,000 people as of 2007. The peoples that speak Daga are located in the Rabaraba subdistrict of Milne Bay district, and in the Abau subdistrict of the Central district of Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe people who speak Daga live in the Rabaraba subdistrict of the Milne Bay Province on Papua New Guinea. This province is about 5,405.4 sq mi (14,000km) with a population of 209,054 people. The\n\nEconomy of the province is brought by tourism, palm oil, and gold mining on Misima Island.\n\nDuring World War II, the Battle of Milne Bay took place in the province giving it some other significance.\n\nThe Massim, the people of Milne Bay, have exchanged culture with nearby islands and gained many rituals from nearby including the Kula ring. The people of the Massim are characterized by matrilineal descent.\n\nThe people of Milne Bay while distinct from, are still in culture sync with Papua New Guinea. The remote, wild, and pristine lands of Papua New guinea holds a lot of diversity. There are over 7000 different cultures in Papua New Guinea although there is only about 7 million people living there. The people of Papua New Guinea have strong ties to music having spontaneous and coordinated acts of musical expression throughout the year.\n\nDaga has thirteen consonants and five vowels.\n\nIn Daga, there are some rules for how to make morphemes. some include, the ending of stems other than G, R, S, and W add /a/ if the next suffix is a consonant-initial suffix. If the final consonant of a prefix is before a consonant-initial stem, the manner of articulation of the final consonant of the prefix is changed to match the manner of articulation of the initial consonant of the stem. When the morpheme has initial phoneme /w/ is comes before the vowel /o/ or /u/, the /w/ is lost in the final word. When the final phoneme of a preceding morpheme and the initial phoneme of a following morpheme are both vowels, the initial-vowel of the following morpheme is lost unless that phoneme is /i/, in which case it is left as is. For all nouns, the final vowel is -e.\n\nWhen the consonants G, R, S, and W end a stem or suffix they have a phoneme change based on the following phoneme.\n\nThis rule has exceptions for these three words:\nIn Daga, word stems are the part of the word that gives the word meaning. Compound word stems are often a verb stem followed by a combination of the verb yaw (\"see\") .\n\nwa ('say') + yaw ('see') = wayaw ('ask')\n\nThis works with all verb stems and completely changes the meaning of the verb stem. Prefix-derived verb stems are verb stems that follow one of four prefixes, wa-, to-, en-, and a-. These prefixes are used to classify the verb stem to identify a certain thing or group of thing. The prefix wa- on a verb stem makes the verb stem only apply to one subject. The prefix to- means that the verb will be changed to involve hitting a singular subject. The prefix en- means the action depicted by the verb is changed to match an action that involves sticking into an object. The prefix a- also adjusts the verb stem to involve biting. Adjective-derived verb stems are verbs that are created by using an adjective stem and verbalization to create a verb out of an adjective. For example, the word \"tama ('straight')\" followed by the verbalization \"-am\" creates an outcome of the word \"tamanam\" ('correct'). There are also noun-derived verb stems which like adjective-derived verb stems use a verbalization and a noun stem to create a verb from a noun. An example of this is when the word \"ago\" ('servant') with the verbalization \"-at\" becomes \"agat\" ('help'). This concept of deriving words from other stems of other classifications also carries across to nouns and adjectives, where Daga has verb-derived noun stems which is when a verb can be nominalized by the suffix \"-at\" and becomes a noun. Although the stems give meaning to the word, the word isn't complete without a suffix.\n\nIn Daga, like many other languages has many different classifications of words. Clitics in Daga is a classification of word which can then be classified again down into 3 more classes, location clitics which describe are used to illustrate location of a noun, substantive clitics which are the last word in a substantive clause or a nominalized clause, and included-clause clitics are used to complete clauses using homophuous medical suffixes. Postpositions are a classification of words that are similar in their manner of usage as that of a clitic in which it is used to mark location, accompaniment, comparison, and temporal construction. Positionals can also be used with personal markers to give location or demonstrate accompaniment alongside a person.\nLong phrases are extremely uncommon in Daga.\n\nIn Daga, there are two intensifiers, \"di\" which is used with any phrase to add emphasis, and \"iren\" is used after a noun, adjective, and positional to add specificity. Conjunctions are used to join phrases, clauses, and sentences. The conjunctions that do these things can be considered different classifications.\nDaga uses \"ya\" as a prefix to illustrate negative tagmeme of the normal verb phrases, and \"uon\" to illustrate negative tagmeme of a summary, sentence, conversational, response, or interrogative. Interrogatives in Daga are illustrated by the elongation of the final syllable along with an initial word to start the clause:\nNumeral roots in Daga are created using an odd system. Daga only has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 and use the convention of using body-parts to represent numbers. For example, the word \"nani\" ('hand') means five and the word \"apen\" ('man') means 20 counting all the fingers and toes attached to that entity. These words along with the word \"yamu\" ('other') creates the phrases that illustrate numbers.\n"}
{"id": "80503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80503", "title": "Decimal separator", "text": "Decimal separator\n\nA decimal separator is a symbol used to separate the integer part from the fractional part of a number written in decimal form.\n\nDifferent countries officially designate different symbols for the decimal separator. The choice of symbol for the decimal separator also affects the choice of symbol for the thousands separator used in digit grouping, so the latter is also treated in this article.\n\nAny such symbol can be called a decimal mark, decimal marker or decimal sign. But symbol-specific names are also used; decimal point and decimal comma refer to an (either baseline or middle) dot and comma respectively, when it is used as a decimal separator; these are the usual terms used in English, with the aforementioned generic terms reserved for abstract usage.\n\nIn many contexts, when a number is spoken, the function of the separator is assumed by the spoken name of the symbol: comma or point in most cases. In some specialized contexts, the word decimal is instead used for this purpose (such as in ICAO-regulated air traffic control communications).\n\nIn mathematics the decimal separator is a type of radix point, a term that also applies to number systems with bases other than ten.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, before printing, a bar ( ¯ ) over the units digit was used to separate the integral part of a number from its fractional part, e.g. 995 (meaning, 99.95 in decimal point format). This practice derived from the decimal system used in Indian mathematics and was popularized by the Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, when Latin translation of his work on the Indian numerals introduced the decimal positional number system to the Western world. His \"Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing\" presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations in Arabic. A similar notation remains in common use as an underbar to superscript digits, especially for monetary values without a decimal separator, e.g. 99. Later, a \"separatrix\" (a short, roughly vertical ink stroke) between the units and tenths position became the norm among Arab mathematicians (e.g. 99ˌ95), while an L-shaped or vertical bar (|) served as the separatrix in England. When this character was typeset, it was convenient to use the existing comma (99,95) or full stop (99.95) instead. \n\nGerbert of Aurillac marked triples of columns with an arc (called a \"Pythagorean arc\") when using his Hindu–Arabic numeral-based abacus in the 10th century. Fibonacci followed this convention when writing numbers such as in his influential work \"Liber Abaci\" in the 13th century. Tables of logarithms prepared by John Napier in 1614 and 1619 used the period (full stop) as the decimal separator, which was then adopted by Henry Briggs in his influential 17th century work.\n\nIn France, the full stop was already in use in printing to make Roman numerals more readable, so the comma was chosen. Many other countries, such as Italy, also chose to use the comma to mark the decimal units position. It has been made standard by the ISO for international blueprints. However, English-speaking countries took the comma to separate sequences of three digits. In some countries, a raised dot or dash (\"\") may be used for grouping or decimal separator; this is particularly common in handwriting. \n\nIn the United States, the full stop or period (.) was used as the standard decimal separator.\nIn the nations of the British Empire, although the full stop could be used in typewritten material and its use was not banned, the interpunct (also known as the decimal point, point, or mid dot) was preferred for the decimal separator in printing technologies that could accommodate it, e.g. 99·95. However, as the mid dot was already in common use in the mathematics world to indicate multiplication, the SI rejected its use as the decimal separator. During the beginning of British metrication in the late 1960s and with impending currency decimalisation, there was some debate in the United Kingdom as to whether the decimal comma or decimal point should be preferred: the British Standards Institution and some sectors of industry advocated the comma and the Decimal Currency Board advocated for the point. In the event, the point was chosen by the Ministry of Technology in 1968.\n\nWhen South Africa adopted the metric system, it adopted the comma as its decimal separator, although a number of house styles, including some English-language newspapers such as \"The Sunday Times\", continue to use the full stop.\n\nThe three most spoken international auxiliary languages, Ido, Esperanto, and Interlingua, all use the comma as the decimal separator. Interlingua has used the comma as its decimal separator since the publication of the in 1951. Esperanto also uses the comma as its official decimal separator, while thousands are separated by non-breaking spaces: . Ido's \"Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di la Linguo Internaciona Ido\" (Complete Detailed Grammar of the International Language Ido) officially states that commas are used for the decimal separator while full stops are used to separate thousands, millions, etc. So the number 12,345,678.90123 (in American notation) for instance, would be written \"12.345.678,90123\" in Ido. The 1931 grammar of Volapük by Arie de Jong uses the comma as its decimal separator, and (somewhat unusually) uses the middle dot as the thousands separator (12·345·678,90123).\n\nIn 1958, disputes between European and American delegates over the correct representation of the decimal separator nearly stalled the development of the ALGOL computer programming language. ALGOL ended up allowing different decimal separators, but most computer languages and standard data formats (e.g. C, Java, Fortran, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)) specify a dot.\n\nThe 22nd General Conference on Weights and Measures declared in 2003 that \"the symbol for the decimal marker shall be either the point on the line or the comma on the line\". It further reaffirmed that \"numbers may be divided in groups of three in order to facilitate reading; neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces between groups\" (e.g.). This usage has therefore been recommended by technical organizations, such as the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nFor ease of reading, numbers with many digits may be divided into groups using a delimiter, such as comma \",\" or dot \".\" or space or underbar \"_\" (as in maritime \"21_450\"). In some countries, these \"digit group separators\" are only employed to the left of the decimal separator; in others, they are also used to separate numbers with a long fractional part. An important reason for grouping is that it allows rapid judgement of the number of digits, via subitizing (telling at a glance) rather than counting – contrast with 100000000 for one hundred million.\n\nSince 2003, the use of spaces as separators (for example: and for \"twenty thousand\" and \"one million\") has been officially endorsed by SI/ISO 31-0 standard, as well as by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the American Medical Association's widely followed \"AMA Manual of Style\", and the Metrication Board, among others.\n\nThe groups created by the delimiters tend to follow the use of the local language, which varies. In European languages, large numbers are read in groups of thousands and the delimiter (which occurs every three digits when it is used) may be called a \"thousands separator\". In East Asian cultures, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, large numbers are read in groups of myriads (10,000s) but the delimiter commonly separates every three digits. The Indian numbering system is somewhat more complex: it groups the rightmost three digits together (till the hundreds place) and thereafter groups by sets of two digits. One trillion would thus be written as 10,00,00,00,00,000 or 10 kharab.\n\nThe convention for digit group separators historically varied among countries, but usually seeking to distinguish the delimiter from the decimal separator. Traditionally, English-speaking countries employed commas as the delimiter – 10,000 – and other European countries employed periods or spaces: 10.000 or . Because of the confusion that could result in international documents, in recent years the use of spaces as separators has been advocated by the superseded SI/ISO 31-0 standard, as well as by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, which have also begun advocating the use of a \"thin space\" in \"groups of three\". Within the United States, the American Medical Association's widely followed \"AMA Manual of Style\" also calls for a thin space. In some online encoding environments (for example, ASCII-only) a thin space is not practical or available, in which case a regular word space or no delimiter are the alternatives.\n\nDigit group separators can occur either as part of the data or as a mask through which the data is displayed. This is an example of the separation of presentation and content, making it possible to display numbers with spaced digit grouping in a way that does not insert any whitespace characters into the string of digits in the content. In many computing contexts, it is preferred to omit digit group separators from the data and instead overlay them as a mask (an input mask or an output mask). Common examples include spreadsheets and databases in which currency values are entered without such marks but are displayed with them inserted. (Similarly, phone numbers can have hyphens, spaces, and/or parentheses as a mask rather than as data.) In web content, such digit grouping can be done with CSS style. It is useful because the number can be copied and pasted into calculators (including a web browser's omnibox) and parsed by the computer as-is (without the user manually purging the extraneous characters). For example, Wikipedia content can display numbers this way, as in the following examples: metres is 1 astronomical unit; is π rounded to 20 decimal places, and is \"e\" rounded to 20 decimal places.\n\nIn some programming languages, it is possible to group the digits in the program's source code to make it easier to read; see Integer literal: Digit separators. Ada, C# (from version 7.0), D, Java, Julia, OCaml, Perl, Python (from version 3.6), Rust, Swift, and Ruby use the underscore (_) character for this purpose. All these languages allow seven hundred million to be entered as 700_000_000. Fixed-form Fortran ignores whitespace (in all contexts), so 700 000 000 is permissible. C++14 allows the use of an apostrophe for digit grouping, so 700'000'000 is permissible.\n\nThe International Bureau of Weights and Measures states that \"when there are only four digits before or after the decimal marker, it is customary not to use a space to isolate a single digit\". Likewise, some manuals of style state that thousands separators should not be used in normal text for numbers from 1000 to 9999 inclusive where no decimal fractional part is shown (in other words, for four-digit whole numbers), whereas others use thousands separators, and others use both. For example, APA style stipulates a thousands separator for \"most figures of 1,000 or more\" except for page numbers, binary digits, temperatures, etc.\n\nThere are always \"common-sense\" country-specific exceptions to digit grouping, such as year numbers, postal codes and ID numbers of predefined nongrouped format, which style guides usually point out.\n\nIn binary (base-2), a full space can be used between groups of four digits, corresponding to a nibble, or equivalently to a hexadecimal digit. For integer numbers, dots are used as well to separate groups of four bits. Alternatively, binary digits may be grouped by threes, corresponding to an octal digit. Similarly, in hexadecimal (base-16), full spaces are usually used to group digits into twos, making each group correspond to a byte. Additionally, groups of eight bytes are often separated by a hyphen.\n\nIn countries with a decimal comma, the decimal point is also common as the \"international\" notation because of the influence of devices, such as electronic calculators, which use the decimal point. Most computer operating systems allow selection of the decimal separator and programs that have been carefully internationalized will follow this, but some programs ignore it and a few may even fail to operate if the setting has been changed.\n\nCountries where a dot \".\" is used as decimal separator include:\nCountries where a comma \",\" is used as decimal separator include:\nUnicode defines a \"decimal separator key symbol\" (⎖ in hex U+2396, decimal 9110) which looks similar to the apostrophe. This symbol is from ISO/IEC 9995 and is intended for use on a keyboard to indicate a key that performs decimal separation.\n\nIn the Arab world, where Eastern Arabic numerals are used for writing numbers, a different character is used to separate the integer and fractional parts of numbers. It is referred to as an Arabic decimal separator () (in hex U+066B) in Unicode. An Arabic thousands separator () also exists.\n\nIn Persian, the decimal separator is called \"momayyez\", which is written like a forward slash—there is a small difference between the \"upside-down (Persian) comma\" character used in sentences and the \"Latin\" comma () (in hex U+066B) used to separate sequences of three digits. To separate sequences of three digits, a Latin comma or blank space may be used; however this is not a standard.\n\nIn English Braille, the decimal point, , is distinct from both the comma, , and the full stop, .\n\nThe following examples show the decimal separator and the thousands separator in various countries that use the Arabic numeral system.\n\n\nUsed with Western Arabic numerals (0123456789):\n\nUsed with Eastern Arabic numerals (٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩):\n\nUsed with keyboards:\n\n"}

Over a period of about ten years between 1894 and 1905, Rice published the books in a set of twelve volumes. The books contain the study of about 9000 inscriptions from lithic surfaces and copper plates, which were found in the region. Apart from the original inscription, an English translation and a Roman transliteration are also provided.\n\nBenjamin Lewis Rice was born in Bangalore in 1837. His father was a Christian missionary and head of the Bangalore parish. After completing his education in England, Rice returned to serve as the principal of Central School in Bangalore. He was also appointed as a secretary of the education commission. When he toured the countryside as an education inspector, he came across various inscriptions. He was interested in epigraphy and he took the help of his assistants to edit, translate and transliterate about 9000 inscriptions. When in 1886, the British made him the head of the Department of Archaeology, he started work towards publishing his epigraphical study and brought out a series of twelve volumes entitled \"Epigraphia Carnatica\".

{"id": "7845537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7845537", "title": "Habitual be", "text": "Habitual be\n\nHabitual \"be\" is the use of an uninflected \"be\" in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and Caribbean English to mark habitual or extended actions, in place of the Standard English inflected forms of \"be\", such as \"is\" and \"are\". In AAVE, use of \"be\" indicates that a subject repeatedly does an action or embodies a trait. In Standard English, the use of (an inflection of) \"be\" merely conveys that an individual has done an action in a particular tense, such as in the statement \"She was singing\" (the habitual being \"she sings\").\n\nIt is a common misconception that AAVE speakers simply replace \"is\" with \"be\" across all tenses, with no added meaning. In fact, AAVE speakers use \"be\" to mark a habitual grammatical aspect not explicitly distinguished in Standard English. For example, to \"be singing\" means \"to sing habitually,\" not \"to presently be singing.\" In one experiment, children were shown drawings of Elmo eating cookies while Cookie Monster looked on. Both black and white subjects agreed that Elmo \"is\" eating cookies, but the black children said that Cookie Monster \"be\" eating cookies.\n\nThe source of habitual \"be\" in AAVE is still disputed. Some linguists suggest it came from the finite \"be\" in the 17th to 19th century English of British settlers (perhaps especially those from South West England, although the usage may be latterday \"Mummerset\" in this context), while other linguists believe that it came from Scots-Irish immigrants whose Ulster Scots dialects mark habitual verb forms with \"be\" and \"do be\".\n\nOne hypothesis is that habitual \"be\" simply diffused into New World Black English from Hibernian English (HE) through contact in the Caribbean. Some evidence is that the two dialects structure sentences with the habitual \"be\" almost identically:\n\nCriticism of the hypothesis stems from the fact that there is no evidence that \"be\" was used as a habitual marker in the past or is used today in Caribbean creoles of English. Instead, Caribbean English speakers use the preverbal \"does\" to mark habitualness. They use \"be\" only as filler between \"does\" and the sentence's predicate.\n\nThe hypothesis states that the geographical differences in use of \"be\" and \"do (be)\", by Northern and Southern HE speakers respectively, accounts for the difference in use of be and does (be) in AAE and Caribbean English respectively. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Northern HE speakers immigrated more to North America, and Southern HE speakers immigrated to the Caribbean Islands, both working alongside blacks. Although the expansion to include the differences in the dialects of HE accounts for the absence of habitual be in Caribbean English creoles, the hypothesis has its disadvantages as well. The first problem is the distribution of \"do\" and \"be\" again. In Southern HE, \"do\" is more common with \"be\" than other verbs, but in Caribbean English, \"does\" is less common with \"be\" than other verbs. Hibernian English marks habitualness on be, and Caribbean English rarely marks it, if at all. A second problem is that there is not sufficient evidence to show that Southern HE speakers did not introduce \"do (be)\" to the American colonies since there were Southern HE speakers in the colonies that worked closely with blacks.\n\nA further expansion and modification of the diffusion hypotheses account for the periphrastic do found in Caribbean English creoles. The \"do\" feature was common in British English and persisted in the nonstandard Southern and Southwestern English dialects that were used by the white colonials in the Caribbean colonies. The Irish and the blacks were both learning English at the same time, and both groups learned a new language while retaining the conventions of their native languages. In America, the Irish feature habitual be may have diffused into AAE and the two assemblages of people were in close contact and communicating with a new tongue. It is possible that British dialects could have had features that served as models for habitual \"do (be)\" in the Caribbean creoles, which, in turn, expanded to AAE in the Americas. It is also worth noting that Southern and Southwestern British immigrants traveled to the American colonies as well and their dialects would have been used as a model to blacks, leading to a drawback, the introduction, and subsequent loss of habitual \"do (be)\" in America, which was also the problem with the first expansion of the diffusion hypothesis. Another hypothesis for the origins of habitual \"be\" in NWBE and afterwards into AAE is the most logical and the strongest of the lot.\n\nThe decreolization theory for the emergence of habitual \"be\" in AAE is the most likely and most supported of the theories of its origin. It involves the decreolization process of Caribbean English creole, with the loss of \"does (be)\", which itself is a decreolization of a previous creole habitual marker and its co-occurrence with \"be\". The process is seen as one code-shifting in the series of English learned by blacks in the New World. The existence of a category of habituals in the native Caribbean languages at the basilectal level shows that over time, blacks learned English but kept the conventions of their native languages until code-shifting replaced these old conventions with new ones. The evidence that Rickford gives is as following:\n\n(18) Habitual aspect with a prepositional phrase or locative:\n\nStage 1: He (d)a de [dc] in the bed. (basilect)\n\nStage 2: He does de in the bed. (hab. (d)a -> does)\n\nStage 3: He does be in the bed. (loc. cop. de -> be)\n\nStage 4: He 0 be in the bed. (does -> 0; be 'habitual')\n\nThis data is just one set of three, with this one preceding a predicate containing a prepositional phrase, and shows the shifting from the basilectal, native language convention, level to the English habitual be level in stage 4, with the coexistence of two or more stages at once. It is hypothesized that the first three stages were present in the speech of plantation slaves, and the hypothesis appears to be supported by the presence of these stages today on the Sea Islands of the United States, with only stage four surviving anywhere else in America. The advantages of this hypothesis are that there is no assumption that blacks had no native language influence and that the conventions of English were perfectly copied to the emerging English grammars of blacks and the fact that the decreolizing of habitual be also follows the pattern of decreolization in general linguistics and the pattern in cultural anthropology, with formal approximations of English over time and cultural assimilation of language respectively. Another merit is that this same pattern of decreolizing of be is found in other creoles that are relatively close to AAE and affirm the plausibility of this origin for habitual be. Yet another merit for this hypothesis is that it can incorporate the strong points of the revised diffusion hypotheses and surmount the weaknesses associated with them. For instance, creoles and dialects have lexicons that derive from the languages that feed them, and AAE and Caribbean English are no different; they followed the models of language dialects that came in contact with them and used their native language conventions as well as the newly learned conventions to mutate into varieties of the model language. A possible disadvantage of the hypothesis is that it does not work for area in which creoles did not develop, such as areas of America with very few blacks in the population. Another possible disadvantage is that the sources of slaves for the differing regions of America and the Caribbean could have led to different creole starting points, leading to the different habitual markers in AAE and Caribbean English creoles. The two minor problems are far outweighed by the advantages that the hypothesis has and further affirm that it is the best possible origin of habitual \"be\".\n\n"}

Categorized as formulaic language, an idiom's figurative meaning is different from the literal meaning. There are thousands of idioms, occurring frequently in all languages. It is estimated that there are at least twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions in the English language.\n\nMany idiomatic expressions, in their original use, were not figurative but had literal meaning. Also, sometimes the attribution of a literal meaning can change as the phrase becomes disconnected from its original roots, leading to a folk etymology. For instance, \"spill the beans\" (meaning to reveal a secret) has been said to originate from an ancient method of democratic voting, wherein a voter would put a bean into one of several cups to indicate which candidate he wanted to cast his vote for. If the jars were spilled before the counting of votes was complete, anyone would be able to see which jar had more beans, and therefore which candidate was the winner. Over time, the practice was discontinued and the idiom became figurative.\n\nHowever, this etymology for \"spill the beans\" has been questioned by linguists. The earliest known written accounts come from the USA and involve horse racing around 1902–1903, and the one who \"spilled the beans\" was an unlikely horse who won a race, thus causing the favorites to lose. By 1907 the term was being used in baseball, but the subject who \"spilled the beans\" shifted to players who made mistakes, allowing the other team to win. By 1908 the term was starting to be applied to politics, in the sense that crossing the floor in a vote was \"spilling the beans\". However, in all these early usages the term \"spill\" was used in the sense of \"upset\" rather than \"divulge\". A Stack Exchange discussion provided a large number of links to historic newspapers covering the usage of the term from 1902 onwards.\n\nOther idioms are deliberately figurative. \"Break a leg\", used as an ironic way of wishing good luck in a performance or presentation, may have arisen from the belief that one ought not to utter the words \"good luck\" to an actor. By wishing someone bad luck, it is supposed that the opposite will occur.\n\nIn linguistics, idioms are usually presumed to be figures of speech contradicting the principle of compositionality. That compositionality is the key notion for the analysis of idioms is emphasized in most accounts of idioms. This principle states that the meaning of a whole should be constructed from the meanings of the parts that make up the whole. In other words, one should be in a position to understand the whole if one understands the meanings of each of the parts that make up the whole. The following example is widely employed to illustrate the point:\n\nUnderstood compositionally, Fred has literally kicked an actual, physical bucket. The much more likely idiomatic reading, however, is non-compositional: Fred is understood to have died. Arriving at the idiomatic reading from the literal reading is unlikely for most speakers. What this means is that the idiomatic reading is, rather, stored as a single lexical item that is now largely independent of the literal reading.\n\nIn phraseology, idioms are defined as a sub-type of , the meaning of which is not the regular sum of the meanings of its component parts. John Saeed defines an idiom as collocated words that became affixed to each other until metamorphosing into a fossilised term. This collocation of words redefines each component word in the word-group and becomes an \"idiomatic expression\". Idioms usually do not translate well; in some cases, when an idiom is translated directly word-for-word into another language, either its meaning is changed or it is meaningless.\n\nWhen two or three words are often used together in a particular sequence, the words are said to be irreversible binomials, or Siamese twins. Usage will prevent the words from being displaced or rearranged. For example, a person may be left \"high and dry\" but never \"dry and high\". This idiom in turn means that the person is left in their former condition rather than being assisted so that their condition improves. Not all Siamese twins are idioms, however. \"Chips and dip\" is an irreversible binomial, but it refers to literal food items, not idiomatic ones.\n\nIdioms possess varying degrees of mobility. While some idioms are used only in a routine form, others can undergo syntactic modifications such as passivization, raising constructions, and clefting, demonstrating separable constituencies within the idiom. \"Mobile idioms\", allowing such movement, maintain their idiomatic meaning where \"fixed idioms\" do not:\nMany fixed idioms lack \"semantic composition\", meaning that the idiom contains the semantic role of a verb, but not of any object. This is true of \"kick the bucket\", which means \"die\". By contrast, the semantically composite idiom \"spill the beans\", meaning \"reveal a secret\", contains both a semantic verb and object, \"reveal\" and \"secret\". Semantically composite idioms have a syntactic similarity between their surface and semantic forms.\n\nThe types of movement allowed for certain idiom also relate to the degree to which the literal reading of the idiom has a connection to its idiomatic meaning. This is referred to as \"motivation\" or \"transparency\". While most idioms that do not display semantic composition generally do not allow non-adjectival modification, those that are also motivated allow lexical substitution. For example, \"oil the wheels\" and \"grease the wheels\" allow variation for nouns that elicit a similar literal meaning. These types of changes can occur only when speakers can easily recognize a connection between what the idiom is meant to express and its literal meaning, thus an idiom like \"kick the bucket\" cannot occur as \"kick the pot\".\n\nFrom the perspective of dependency grammar, idioms are represented as a catena which cannot be interrupted by non-idiomatic content. Although syntactic modifications introduce disruptions to the idiomatic structure, this continuity is only required for idioms as lexical entries.\n\nCertain idioms, allowing unrestricted syntactic modification, can be said to be metaphors. Expressions such as \"jump on the bandwagon\", \"pull strings\", and \"draw the line\" all represent their meaning independently in their verbs and objects, making them compositional. In the idiom \"jump on the bandwagon\", \"jump on\" involves joining something and a 'bandwagon' can refer to a collective cause, regardless of context.\n\nA literal word-by-word translation of an opaque idiom will most likely not convey the same meaning in other languages. The English idiom \"kick the bucket\" has a variety of equivalents in other languages, such as \"kopnąć w kalendarz\" (\"kick the calendar\") in Polish, \"casser sa pipe\" (\"to break his pipe\") in French and \"tirare le cuoia\" (\"pulling the leathers\") in Italian.\n\nSome idioms are transparent. Much of their meaning does get through if they are taken (or translated) literally. For example, \"lay one's cards on the table\" meaning to reveal previously unknown intentions, or to reveal a secret. Transparency is a matter of degree; \"spill the beans\" (to let secret information become known) and \"leave no stone unturned\" (to do everything possible in order to achieve or find something) are not entirely literally interpretable, but only involve a slight metaphorical broadening. Another category of idioms is a word having several meanings, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes discerned from the context of its usage. This is seen in the (mostly uninflected) English language in polysemes, the common use of the same word for an activity, for those engaged in it, for the product used, for the place or time of an activity, and sometimes for a verb.\n\nIdioms tend to confuse those unfamiliar with them; students of a new language must learn its idiomatic expressions as vocabulary. Many natural language words have \"idiomatic origins\", but are assimilated, so losing their figurative senses, for example, in Portuguese, the expression \"saber de coração\" 'to know by heart', with the same meaning as in English, was shortened to 'saber de cor', and, later, to the verb \"decorar\", meaning \"memorize\".\n\nIn 2015, TED collected 40 examples of bizarre idioms that cannot be translated literally. They include the Swedish saying \"to slide in on a shrimp sandwich\", which refers to somebody who didn't have to work to get where they are.\"\n\nThe non-compositionality of meaning of idioms challenges theories of syntax. The fixed words of many idioms do not qualify as constituents in any sense. For example:\n\nThe fixed words of this idiom (in bold) do not form a constituent in any theory's analysis of syntactic structure because the object of the preposition (here \"this situation\") is not part of the idiom (but rather it is an argument of the idiom). One can know that it is not part of the idiom because it is variable; for example, \"How do we get to the bottom of this situation / the claim / the phenomenon / her statement /\" etc. What this means is that theories of syntax that take the constituent to be the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis are challenged. The manner in which units of meaning are assigned to units of syntax remains unclear. This problem has motivated a tremendous amount of discussion and debate in linguistics circles and it is a primary motivator behind the Construction Grammar framework.\n\nA relatively recent development in the syntactic analysis of idioms departs from a constituent-based account of syntactic structure, preferring instead the catena-based account. The catena unit was introduced to linguistics by William O'Grady in 1998. Any word or any combination of words that are linked together by dependencies qualifies as a catena. The words constituting idioms are stored as catenae in the lexicon, and as such, they are concrete units of syntax. The dependency grammar trees of a few sentences containing non-constituent idioms illustrate the point:\n\nThe fixed words of the idiom (in orange) in each case are linked together by dependencies; they form a catena. The material that is outside of the idiom (in normal black script) is not part of the idiom. The following two trees illustrate proverbs:\n\nThe fixed words of the proverbs (in orange) again form a catena each time. The adjective \"nitty-gritty\" and the adverb \"always\" are not part of the respective proverb and their appearance does not interrupt the fixed words of the proverb. A caveat concerning the catena-based analysis of idioms concerns their status in the lexicon. Idioms are lexical items, which means they are stored as catenae in the lexicon. In the actual syntax, however, some idioms can be broken up by various functional constructions.\n\nThe catena-based analysis of idioms provides a basis for an understanding of meaning compositionality. The Principle of Compositionality can in fact be maintained. Units of meaning are being assigned to catenae, whereby many of these catenae are not constituents.\n\nA multiword expression is \"lexical units larger than a word that can bear both idiomatic and compositional meanings. (...) the term multi-word expression is used as a pre-theoretical label to include the range of phenomena that goes from collocations to fixed expressions.\" It is a problem in natural language processing when trying to translate lexical units such as idioms.\n\n"}

The term metalocutionary act has developed a more general meaning and may include, for example, quotation acts and comments on preceding speech acts.\n\nMetalocutionary deixis is the denotation (in the strict semantic sense) of utterance constituents at points and over intervals in the temporal structure of utterances by means of prosodic deictic indices such as pitch accents, intonation contours and boundary tones.\n\nIn the prosodic literature, \"mark\" is often used informally instead of the strict \"denote\". The metalocutionary functions are structural rather than attitudinal or emotional functions of prosody. A precursor of the concept of metalocutionary function is found in the configurational function of intonation proposed by the Prague School of linguistics (e.g. Trubetzkoy 1939), with the more specific culmination function and delimitation function, as in accentuation on the one hand and domain or boundary marking on the other.\n\nExample 1: In orthography, e.g. \"Are Henry and Catherine REALly going?\", capitalisation (or other highlighting) of the syllable \"real\" and punctuation (including the initial capital \"a\" and the interrogation point) are orthographic metalocutions: capitalisation denotes the syllable \"real\" and the word \"really\", of which the syllable is a constituent, while the punctuation denotes the domain of the question function.\n\nExample 2: In the pronunciation of \"Are Henry and Catherine REALly going?\" (where the syllable \"real\" may receive a pitch accent, and the interrogation point may be rendered with a rising final tone and a globally rising pitch contour), the pitch accent is a prosodic metalocution which denotes the syllable \"real\" and the word \"really\", and the final rising pitch is a prosodic metalocution which denotes the end portion of the utterance (as well as a non-final or question speech act); the global rising pitch is a prosodic metalocution which denotes an intonation domain.\n\nGibbon, Dafydd (1976). \"Perspectives of Intonation Analysis.\" Bern: Lang.\n\nGibbon, Dafydd (1983). \"Intonation in context: an essay on metalocutionary deixis\".

{"id": "31428107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31428107", "title": "Oil well control", "text": "Oil well control\n\nOil well control is the management of the dangerous effects caused by the unexpected release of formation fluid, such as natural gas and/or crude oil, upon surface equipment of oil or gas drilling rigs and escaping into the atmosphere. Technically, oil well control involves preventing the formation fluid, usually referred to as kick, from entering into the wellbore during drilling.\n\nFormation fluid can enter the wellbore if the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation being drilled. Oil well control also includes monitoring a well for signs of impending influx of formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling and procedures, to stop the well from flowing when it happens by taking proper remedial actions.\n\nFailure to manage and control these pressure effects can cause serious equipment damage and injury, or loss of life. Improperly managed well control situations can cause blowouts, which are uncontrolled and explosive expulsions of formation fluid from the well, potentially resulting in a fire.\n\nOil well control is one of the most important aspects of drilling operations. Improper handling of kicks in oil well control can result in blowouts with very grave consequences, including the loss of valuable resources. Even though the cost of a blowout (as a result of improper/no oil well control) can easily reach several millions of US dollars, the monetary loss is not as serious as the other damages that can occur: irreparable damage to the environment, waste of valuable resources, ruined equipment, and most importantly, the safety and lives of personnel on the drilling rig.\n\nIn order to avert the consequences of blowout, the utmost attention must be given to oil well control. That is why oil well control procedures should be in place prior to the start of an abnormal situation noticed within the wellbore, and ideally when a new rig position is sited. In other words, this includes the time the new location is picked, all drilling, completion, workover, snubbing and any other drilling-related operations that should be executed with proper oil well control in mind. This type of preparation involves widespread training of personnel, the development of strict operational guidelines and the design of drilling programs — maximizing the probability of successfully regaining hydrostatic control of a well after a significant influx of formation fluid has taken place.\n\nPressure is a very important concept in the oil and gas industry. Pressure can be defined as: the force exerted per unit area. Its SI unit is newtons per square metre or pascals. Another unit, bar, is also widely used as a measure of pressure, with 1 bar equal to 100 kilopascals. Normally pressure is measured in the U.S. petroleum industry in units of pounds force per square inch of area, or psi. 1000  psi equals 6894.76 kilo-pascals.\n\nHydrostatic pressure (HSP), as stated, is defined as pressure due to a column of fluid that is not moving. That is, a column of fluid that is static, or at rest, exerts pressure due to local force of gravity on the column of the fluid.\n\nThe formula for calculating hydrostatic pressure in SI units (N/m²) is:\n\nAll fluids in a wellbore exert hydrostatic pressure, which is a function of density and vertical height of the fluid column. In US oil field units, hydrostatic pressure can be expressed as:\n\nThe 0.052 is needed as the conversion factor to psi unit of HSP.\n\nTo convert these units to SI units, one can use:\n\n\nThe pressure gradient is described as the pressure per unit length. Often in oil well control, pressure exerted by fluid is expressed in terms of its pressure gradient. The SI unit is pascals/metre. The hydrostatic pressure gradient can be written as:\n\nFormation pressure is the pressure exerted by the formation fluids, which are the liquids and gases contained in the geologic formations encountered while drilling for oil or gas. It can also be said to be the pressure contained within the pores of the formation or reservoir being drilled. Formation pressure is a result of the hydrostatic pressure of the formation fluids, above the depth of interest, together with pressure trapped in the formation. Under formation pressure, there are 3 levels:\nnormally pressured formation,\nabnormal formation pressure, or\nsubnormal formation pressure.\n\nNormally pressured formation has a formation pressure that is the same with the hydrostatic pressure of the fluids above it. As the fluids above the formation are usually some form of water, this pressure can be defined as the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level.\n\nThe normal hydrostatic pressure gradient for freshwater is 0.433 pounds per square inch per foot (psi/ft), or 9.792 kilopascals per meter (kPa/m), and 0.465 psi/ft for water with dissolved solids like in Gulf Coast waters, or 10.516 kPa/m. The density of formation water in saline or marine environments, such as along the Gulf Coast, is about 9.0 ppg or 1078.43 kg/m³. Since this is the highest for both Gulf Coast water and fresh water, a normally pressured formation can be controlled with a 9.0 ppg mud.\n\nSometimes the weight of the overburden, which refers to the rocks and fluids above the formation, will tend to compact the formation, resulting in pressure built-up within the formation if the fluids are trapped in place. The formation in this case will retain its normal pressure only if there is a communication with the surface. Otherwise, an \"abnormal formation pressure\" will result.\n\nAs discussed above, once the fluids are trapped within the formation and not allow to escape there is a pressure build-up leading to abnormally high formation pressures. This will generally require a mud weight of greater than 9.0 ppg to control. Excess pressure, called \"overpressure\" or \"geopressure\", can cause a well to blow out or become uncontrollable during drilling.\n\nSubnormal formation pressure is a formation pressure that is less than the normal pressure for the given depth. It is common in formations that had undergone production of original hydrocarbon or formation fluid in them.\n\n\"Overburden pressure\" is the pressure exerted by the weight of the rocks and contained fluids above the zone of interest. Overburden pressure varies in different regions and formations. It is the force that tends to compact a formation vertically. The density of these usual ranges of rocks is about 18 to 22 ppg (2,157 to 2,636 kg/m). This range of densities will generate an overburden pressure gradient of about 1 psi/ft (22.7 kPa/m). Usually, the 1 psi/ft is not applicable for shallow marine sediments or massive salt. In offshore however, there is a lighter column of sea water, and the column of underwater rock does not go all the way to the surface. Therefore, a lower overburden pressure is usually generated at an offshore depth, than would be found at the same depth on land.\n\nMathematically, overburden pressure can be derived as:\n\nwhere\n\nThe bulk density of the sediment is a function of rock matrix density, porosity within the confines of the pore spaces, and porefluid density. This can be expressed as\n\nwhere\n\n\"Fracture pressure\" can be defined as pressure required to cause a formation to fail or split. As the name implies, it is the pressure that causes the formation to fracture and the circulating fluid to be lost. Fracture pressure is usually expressed as a gradient, with the common units being psi/ft (kPa/m) or ppg (kg/m).\n\nTo fracture a formation, three things are generally needed, which are:\n\n\n\"Pump pressure\", which is also referred to as \"system pressure loss\", is the sum total of all the pressure losses from the oil well surface equipment, the drill pipe, the drill collar, the drill bit, and annular friction losses around the drill collar and drill pipe. It measures the system pressure loss at the start of the circulating system and measures the total friction pressure.\n\n\"Slow pump pressure\" is the circulating pressure (pressure used to pump fluid through the whole active fluid system, including the borehole and all the surface tanks that constitute the primary system during drilling) at a reduced rate. SPP is very important during a well kill operation in which circulation (a process in which drilling fluid is circulated out of the suction pit, down the drill pipe and drill collars, out the bit, up the annulus, and back to the pits while drilling proceeds) is done at a reduced rate to allow better control of circulating pressures and to enable the mud properties (density and viscosity) to be kept at desired values. The slow pump pressure can also be referred to as \"kill rate pressure\" or \"slow circulating pressure\" or \"kill speed pressure\" and so on.\n\n\"Shut-in drill pipe pressure\" (SIDPP), which is recorded when a well is shut in on a kick, is a measure of the difference between the pressure at the bottom of the hole and the hydrostatic pressure (HSP) in the drillpipe. During a well shut-in, the pressure of the wellbore stabilizes, and the formation pressure equals the pressure at the bottom of the hole. The drillpipe at this time should be full of known-density fluid. Therefore, the formation pressure can be easily calculated using the SIDPP. This means that the SIDPP gives a direct of formation pressure during a kick.\n\nThe \"shut-in casing pressure\" (SICP) is a measure of the difference between the formation pressure and the HSP in the annulus when a kick occurs.\n\nThe pressures encountered in the annulus can be estimated using the following mathematical equation:\n\nwhere\n\n\"Bottom-hole pressure\" (BHP) is the pressure at the bottom of a well. The pressure is usually measured at the bottom of the hole. This pressure may be calculated in a static, fluid-filled wellbore with the equation:\n\nwhere\n\nIn Canada the formula is depth in meters x density in kgs x the constant gravity factor (0.00981), which will give the hydrostatic pressure of the well bore or (hp) hp=bhp with pumps off.\nThe bottom-hole pressure is dependent on the following:\nTherefore, BHP can be said to be the sum of all pressures at the bottom of the wellhole, which equals:\n\nThere are some basic calculations that need to be carried during oil well control. A few of these essential calculations will be discussed below. Most of the units here are in US oil field units, but these units can be converted to their SI units equivalent by using this Conversion of units link.\n\nThe capacity of drill string is an essential issue in oil well control. The capacity of drillpipe, drill collars or hole is the volume of fluid that can be contained within them.\n\nThe capacity formula is as shown below:\n\nwhere\n\nAlso the total pipe or hole volume is given by :\n\nFeet of pipe occupied by a given volume is given by:\n\nCapacity calculation is important in oil well control due to the following:\n\nThis is the volume contained between the inside diameter of the hole and the outside diameter of the pipe.\nAnnular capacity is given by :\n\nwhere\n\nSimilarly\n\nand\n\n\"Fluid level drop\" is the distance the mud level will drop when a dry string(a bit that is not plugged) is being pulled from the wellbore and it is given by:\n\nor\n\nand the resulting loss of HSP is given by:\n\nwhere\n\nWhen pulling a wet string (the bit is plugged) and the fluid from the drillpipe is not returned to the hole. The fluid drop is then changed to the following:\n\n\"Kill Mud weight\" is the density of the mud required to balance formation pressure during kill operation. The Kill Weight Mud can be calculated by:\n\nwhere\n\nBut when the formation pressure can be determined from data sources such as bottom hole pressure, then \"KWM\" can be calculated as follows:\n\nwhere \"FP\" = Formation pressure.\n\nKick is the entry of formation fluid into the wellbore during drilling operations. It occurs because the pressure exerted by the column of drilling fluid is not great enough to overcome the pressure exerted by the fluids in the formation drilled. The whole essence of oil well control is to prevent kick from occurring and if it happens to prevent it from developing into blowout. An uncontrolled kick usually results from not deploying the proper equipment, using poor practices, or a lack of training of the rig crews. Loss of oil well control may lead into blowout, which represents one of the most severe threats associated with the exploration of petroleum resources involving the risk of lives and environmental and economic consequences.\n\nA kick will occur when the bottom hole pressure(BHP) of a well falls below the formation pressure and the formation fluid flows into the wellbore.There are usually causes for kicks some of which are:\n\n\"Tripping\" is the complete operation of removing the drillstring from the wellbore and running it back in the hole. This operation is typically undertaken when the bit (which is the tool used to crush or cut rock during drilling) becomes dull or broken, and no longer drills the rock efficiently. A typical drilling operation of deep oil or gas wells may require up to 8 or more trips of the drill string to replace a dull rotary bit for one well.\n\nTripping out of the hole means that the entire volume of steel (of drillstring) is being removed, or has been removed, from the well. This displacement of the drill string (the steel) will leave out a volume of space that must be replaced with an equal volume of mud. If the replacement is not done, the fluid level in the wellbore will drop, resulting in a loss of hydrostatic pressure (HSP) and bottom hole pressure (BHP). If this bottom hole pressure reduction goes below the formation pressure, a kick will definitely occur.\n\n\"Swabbing\" occurs when bottom hole pressure is reduced due to the effects of pulling the drill string upward in the bored hole. During the tripping out of the hole, the space formed by the drillpipe, drill collar, or tubing (which are being removed) must be replaced by something, usually mud. If the rate of tripping out is greater than the rate the mud is being pumped into the void space (created by the removal of the drill string), then swab will occur. If the reduction in bottom hole pressure caused by swabbing is below formation pressure, then a kick will occur.\n\n\"Lost circulation\" usually occurs when the hydrostatic pressure fractures an open formation. When this occurs, there is loss in circulation, and the height of the fluid column decreases, leading to lower HSP in the wellbore. A kick can occur if steps are not taken to keep the hole full. Lost circulation can be caused by:\n\nIf the density of the drilling fluid or mud in the well bore is not sufficient to keep the formation pressure in check, then a kick can occur. Insufficient density of the drilling fluid can be as a result of the following :\n\nAnother cause of kicks is drilling accidentally into abnormally-pressured permeable zones. The increased formation pressure may be greater than the bottom hole pressure, resulting in a kick.\n\nDrilling into an adjacent well is a potential problem, particularly in offshore drilling where a\nlarge number of directional wells are drilled from the same platform. If the drilling well penetrates the production string of a previously completed well, the formation fluid from the completed well will enter the wellbore of the drilling well, causing a kick. If this occurs at a shallow depth, it is an extremely dangerous situation and could easily result in an uncontrolled blowout with little to no warning of the event.\n\nA drill-stem test is performed by setting a packer above the formation to be tested, and allowing the formation to flow. During the course of the test, the bore hole or casing below the packer, and at least a portion of the drill pipe or tubing, is filled with formation fluid. At the conclusion of the test, this fluid must be removed by proper well control techniques to return the well to a safe condition. Failure to follow the correct procedures to kill the well could lead to a blowout.\n\nImproper fill on trip occurs when the volume of drilling fluid to keep the hole full on a Trip (complete operation of removing the drillstring from the wellbore and running it back in the hole) is less than that calculated or less than Trip Book Record. This condition is usually caused by formation fluid entering the wellbore due to the swabbing action of the drill string, and, if action is not taken soon, the well will enter a kick state.\n\nIn oil well control, a kick should be able to be detected promptly, and if a kick is detected, proper kick prevention operations must be taken immediately to avoid a blowout. There are various tell-tale signs that signal an alert crew that a kick is about to start. Knowing these signs will keep a kicking oil well under control, and avoid a blowout:\n\nA sudden increase in penetration rate (drilling break) is usually caused by a change in the type of formation being drilled. However, it may also signal an increase in formation pore pressure, which may indicate a possible kick.\n\nIf the rate at which the pumps are running is held constant, then the flow from the annulus should be constant. If the annulus flow increases without a corresponding change in pumping rate, the additional flow is caused by formation fluid(s) feeding into the well bore or gas expansion. This will indicate an impending kick.\n\nIf there is an unexplained increase in the volume of surface mud in the pit (a large tank that holds drilling fluid on the rig), it could signify an impending kick. This is because as the formation fluid feeds into the wellbore, it causes more drilling fluid to flow from the annulus than is pumped down the drill string, thus the volume of fluid in the pit(s) increases.\n\nA decrease in pump pressure or increase in pump speed can happen as a result of a decrease in hydrostatic pressure of the annulus as the formation fluids enters the wellbore. As the lighter formation fluid flows into the wellbore, the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the annular column of fluid decreases, and the drilling fluid in the drill pipe tends to U-tube into the annulus. When this occurs, the pump pressure will drop, and the pump speed will increase. The lower pump pressure and increase in pump speed symptoms can also be indicative of a hole in the drill string, commonly referred to as a washout. Until a confirmation can be made whether a washout or a well kick has occurred, a kick should be assumed.\n\nThere are basically three types of oil well control which are:\nprimary oil well control,\nsecondary oil well control, and \ntertiary oil well control. Those types are explained below.\n\nPrimary oil well control is the process which maintains a hydrostatic pressure in the\nwellbore greater than the pressure of the fluids in the formation being drilled, but less than formation fracture pressure. It uses the mud weight to provide sufficient pressure to prevent an influx of formation fluid into the wellbore. If hydrostatic pressure is less than formation pressure, then formation fluids will enter the wellbore. If the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid in the wellbore exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation, then the fluid in the well could be lost. In an extreme case of lost circulation, the formation pressure may exceed hydrostatic pressure, allowing formation fluids to enter into the well.\n\nSecondary oil well control is done after the Primary oil well control has failed to prevent formation fluids from entering the wellbore. This process uses “blow out preventer”, a BOP, to prevent the escape of wellbore fluids from the well. As the rams and choke of the BOP remain closed, a pressure built up test is carried out and a kill mud weight calculated and pumped inside the well to kill the kick and circulate it out.\n\nTertiary oil well control describes the third line of defense, where the formation cannot be controlled by primary or secondary well control (hydrostatic and equipment). This happens in underground blowout situations. The following are examples of tertiary well control:\n\n\nUsing shut-in procedures is one of the oil-well-control measures to curtail kicks and prevent a blowout from occurring. Shut-in procedures are specific procedures for closing a well in case of a kick. When any positive indication of a kick is observed, such as a sudden increase in flow, or an increase in pit level, then the well should be shut-in immediately. If a well shut-in is not done promptly, a blowout is likely to happen.\n\nShut-in procedures are usually developed and practiced for every rig activity, such as drilling, tripping, logging, running tubular, performing a drill stem test, and so on. The primary purpose of a specific shut-in procedure is to minimize kick volume entering into a wellbore when a kick occurs, regardless of what phase of rig activity is occurring. However, a shut-in procedure is a company-specific procedure, and the policy of a company will dictate how a well should be shut-in.\n\nThey are generally two type of Shut-in procedures which are soft shut-in or hard shut-in. Of these two methods, the hard shut-in is the fastest method to shut in the well; therefore, it will minimize the volume of kick allowed into the wellbore.\n\nSource: \nA well kill procedure is an oil well control method. Once the well has been shut-in on a kick, proper kill procedures must be done immediately. The general idea in well kill procedure is to circulate out any formation fluid already in the wellbore during kick, and then circulate a satisfactory weight of kill mud called Kill Weight Mud (KWM) into the well without allowing further fluid into the hole. If this can be done, then once the kill mud has been fully circulated around the well, it is possible to open up the well and restart normal operations. Generally, a kill weight mud (KWM) mix, which provides just hydrostatic balance for formation pressure, is circulated. This allows approximately constant bottom hole pressure, which is slightly greater than formation pressure to be maintained, as the kill circulation proceeds because of the additional small circulating friction pressure loss. After circulation, the well is opened up again.\n\nThe major well kill procedures used in oil well control are listed below:\n\nThere will always be potential oil well control problems, as long as there are drilling operations anywhere in the world. Most of these well control problems are as a result of some errors and can be eliminated, even though some are actually unavoidable. Since we know the consequences of failed well control are severe, efforts should be made to prevent some human errors which are the root causes of these incidents. These causes include:\n\n\nAn effective oil-well-control culture can be established within a company by requiring well control training of all rig workers, by assessing well control competence at the rigsite, and by supporting qualified personnel in carrying out safe well control practices during the drilling process. Such a culture also requires personnel involved in oil well control to commit to following the right procedures at the right time. Clearly communicated policies and procedures, credible training, competence assurance, and management support can minimize and mitigate well control incidents. An effective well control culture is built upon technically competent personnel who are also trained and skilled in crew resource management (a discipline within human factors), which comprises situation awareness, decision-making (problem-solving), communication, teamwork, and leadership. Training programs are developed and accredited by organizations such as the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) and International Well Control Forum (IWCF).\n\nIADC, headquartered in Houston, TX, is a nonprofit industry association that accredits well control training through a program called WellSharp, which is aimed at providing the necessary knowledge and practical skills critical to successful well control. This training comprises drilling and well servicing activities, as well as course levels applicable to everyone involved in supporting or conducting drilling operations--from the office support staff to the floorhands and drillers and up to the most-experienced supervisory personnel. Training such as those included in the WellSharp program and the courses offered by IWCF contribute to the competence of personnel, but true competence can be assessed only at the jobsite during operations. Therefore, IADC also accredits industry competence assurance programs to help ensure quality and consistency of the competence assurance process for drilling operations. IADC has regional offices all over the world and accredits companies worldwide. IWCF is an NGO, headquartered in Europe, whose main aim is to develop and administer well-control certification programs for personnel employed in oil-well drilling and for workover and well-intervention operations.\n\n"}

When a married print is created, this frame is slightly re-cropped by the frame line and optical soundtrack down to Academy ratio (1.37:1). The movie projector then uses an aperture mask to soft matte the Academy frame to the intended aspect ratio (1.85:1 or 1.66:1). When the 4:3 full-screen video master is created, many filmmakers may prefer to use the full Academy frame (\"open matte\") instead of creating a pan and scan version from within the 1.85 framing. Because the framing is increased vertically in the open matte process, the decision to use it needs to be made prior to shooting, so that the camera operator can frame for 1.85:1 and \"protect\" for 4:3; otherwise unintended objects such as boom microphones, cables, and light stands may appear in the open matte frame, thus requiring some amount of pan and scan in some or all scenes. Additionally, the un-matted 4:3 version will often throw off an otherwise tightly-framed shot and add an inordinate amount of headroom above actors (particularly with 1.85:1).\n\nOpen-matte doesn't happen as often with films presented in 2.20:1 or 2.39:1. Instead those employ pan and scan. Many films over the years have used this technique, the most prominent of which include \"Schindler's List\", \"Titanic\", and \"Top Gun\". Stanley Kubrick also used this technique for his last five films (\"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971), \"Barry Lyndon\" (1975), \"The Shining\" (1980), \"Full Metal Jacket\" (1987) and \"Eyes Wide Shut\" (1999).) James Cameron's \"\" (1991) is also an example of open-matte.\n\n"}

It was designed to serve as a handheld computer device that translates English into one of 40 different languages.\n\nThe Phraselator is a small speech translation PDA-sized device designed to aid in interpretation. The device does not produce synthesized speech like that utilized by Stephen Hawking; instead, it plays pre-recorded foreign language MP3 files. Users can select the phrase they wish to convey from an English list on the screen or speak into the device. It then uses speech recognition technology called DynaSpeak, developed by SRI International, to play the proper sound file. The accuracy of the speech recognition software is over 70 percent according to software developer Jack Buchanan. The device can also record replies for translation later.\n\nPre-recorded phrases are stored on Secure Digital flash memory cards. A 128 MB card can hold up to 12,000 phrases in 4 or 5 languages. Users can download phrase modules from the official website, which contained over 300,000 phrases as of March 2005. Users can also construct their own custom phrase modules.\n\nEarlier devices were known to have run on an SA-1110 Strong Arm 206 MHz CPU with 32MB SDRAM and 32MB onboard Flash RAM.\n\nA newer model, the P2, was released in 2004 and developed according to feedback from U.S. soldiers. It translates one way from English to approximately 60 other languages. It has a directional microphone, a larger library of phrases and a longer battery life. The 2004 release was created by and utilizes a computer board manufactured by InHand Electronics, Inc.\n\nIn the future, the device will be able to display pictures so users can ask questions such as \"Have you seen this person?\"\n\nDeveloper Ace Sarich notes that the device is inferior to human interpreter.\nConclusions derived from a Nepal field test conducted by U.S. and Nepal based NGO Himalayan Aid in 2004 seemed to confirm Sarich's comparisons:\nThe very concept of using a machine as a communication point between individuals seemed to actually encourage a more limited form of interaction between tester and respondent. Usually, when limited language skills are present between parties, the genuine struggle and desire to communicate acts as a display of good will – we openly display our weakness in this regard – and the result is a more relaxed and human encounter. This was not necessarily present with the Phraselator as all parties abandoned learning about each other and instead focused on learning how to work with the device. As a tool for bridging any cultural differences or communicating effectively at any length, the Phraselator would not be recommended. This device, at least in the form tested, would best be used in large-scale operations where there is no time for language training and there is a need to communicate fixed ideas, quickly, over the greatest distance by employing large amounts of unskilled users. Large humanitarian or natural disasters in remote areas of third-world countries might be an effective example.\n\nThe original idea for the device came from Lee Morin, a Navy doctor in Operation Desert Storm. To communicate with patients, he played Arabic audio files from his laptop. He informed Ace Sarich, the vice president of VoxTec, about the idea. VoxTec won a DARPA Small Business Innovation Research grant in early 2001 to develop a military-grade handheld phrase translator. \n\nDuring its development, the Phraselator was tested and evaluated by scientists from the Army Research Laboratory. The device was first field tested in Afghanistan in 2001. By 2002, about 500 Phraselators were built for soldiers around the world with another 250 ordered by the U.S. Special Forces. The device cost $2000 to develop and could convert spoken English into one of 200,000 recorded commands and questions in 30 languages. However, the device could only translate one-way. At the time, the only existing two-way voice translator that could convert speech back and forth between languages was the Audio Voice Translation Guide System, or TONGUES, which was developed by Carnegie Mellon University for Lockheed Martin.\n\nAs part of a DARPA program known as the Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use, SRI International has further developed two-way translation software for use in Iraq called IraqComm in 2006 which contains a vocabulary of 40,000 English words and 50,000 words in Iraqi Arabic.\n\nThe handheld translator was recently used by U.S. troops while providing relief to tsunami victims in early 2005. About 500 prototypes of the device were provided to U.S. military forces in Operation Enduring Freedom. Units loaded with Haitian dialects have been provided to U.S. troops in Haiti. Army military police have used it in Kandahar to communicate with POWs. In late 2004, the U.S. Navy began to augment some ships with a version of the device attached to large speakers in order to broadcast clear voice instructions up to away. Corrections officers and law enforcement in Oneida County, New York have tested the device. Hospital emergency rooms and health departments have also evaluated it. Several Native American tribes such as the Choctaw Nation, the Ponca, and the Comanche Nation have also used the device to preserve their dying languages. Various law enforcement agencies, such as the Los Angeles Police Department, also use the phraselator in their patrol cars.\n\nIn March 2004, DARPA director Dr. Tony Tether presented the Small Business Innovative Research Award to the VoxTec division of Marine Acoustics at DARPATech 2004 in Anaheim, CA.

It does \"not\", however, include any postcard without a pre-printed stamp.\n\nIn general, postal stationery is handled similarly to postage stamps; sold from post offices either at the face value of the printed postage or, more likely, with a surcharge to cover the additional cost of the stationery. It can take the form of an official mail issue produced only for the use of government departments. It can be an issue of a military force where an army, perhaps in a distant war, issues letter sheets for the use of its troops to write home. Postal stationery can be overprinted by the government or, occasionally, by a private overprint. In emergency situations, postal stationery has been produced by handstamping envelopes with modified canceling devices; many of the rare Confederate postmasters' provisionals are of this form. Finally, some postal stationery can be printed to private order. In this last case, stamped stationery bearing indicia is applied with postal administration approval and with specified regulations, to paper or cards provided by private persons or organizations. Private impressions result in a wider range of denominations and designs compared with governmental issues.\n\nThe postal services of some countries also offer a form of letter sheet called an aerogram consisting of a blank sheet of paper with folding instructions and adhesive flaps that becomes its own envelope, and carries prepaid postage at either the international airmail letter rate or at a special lower aerogram rate. Letter sheets lend themselves to airmail usage because they are lightweight. Enclosures are not permitted in aerograms. Sales of aerograms in the United States ended in 2006 due to poor sales.\n\nA letter card almost has the advantages of a postal card as far as weight and size, but also the advantage of privacy of contents is concerned. It is a double card, folded over, with gum or adhesive applied to the three open edges. It is then opened by the recipient by tearing perforations on the three sides that are on the message side of the gum. The gummed strip around the card is then discarded, giving rise to the problems collectors have in finding intact used cards. The US has never issued any letter cards.\n\nBefore 1845 correspondence was not enclosed in an envelope. Letters were folded, sealed, addressed and postmarked on the outside. This continued even after adhesive postage stamps were introduced. The popularity of folded letters led postal authorities to introduce stamped letter sheets. These became available in the U.S. in 1861, but the first official postal stationery were the 1838 embossed letter sheets of New South Wales. These were followed by the Mulready stationery that was issued by Great Britain at the same time as the Penny Black in 1840. Since then, most postal services have issued a steady stream of stationery alongside stamps. Often the design of the stationery mimics the contemporaneous stamps, though with less variety and lower printing quality, due to the limitations of printing directly onto the envelope. Much later, 1947 in the U.S., letter sheets morphed into lithographed air letter sheets or aerograms.\n\nPostal cards are postal stationery and have a printed or embossed indicium and are sold by governmental postal authorities. In the United States, they were first produced in 1873. Some of the forms taken by postal cards include the regular single card, the attached message-reply cards, airmail postal cards, and official postal cards used for official government business with a \"penalty for private use\". \n\nPostcards, on the other hand, are cards prepared by private companies that do not have prepaid franking and readily available at commercial outlets. They are frequently illustrated with pictures or printed advertisements. They are generally \"not\" considered postal stationery.\n\nA strong envelope with an imprinted stamp sold only for use with the registered mail service. Confusingly, these are usually marked \"Registered Letter\" but that term strictly only relates to a normal letter or packet that has extra postage and markings applied so that it may travel under the registered mail service.\n\nThe envelope form may be called a stamped envelope or, alternatively, a postal stationery envelope (PSE for short). In August 1852 an act of the U.S. Congress authorized the Postmaster General to provide \"suitable letter envelopes with such watermarks or other guards against counterfeits... with the addition of the value or denomination of the postage stamps so printed or impressed thereon...\". The first result was the 1853 Nesbitt issues of stamped envelopes, named after the contractor who produced them for the government. Considering the different envelope sizes, knives, colors, dies to print the indicia, and denominations there are literally thousands of different stamped envelopes produced for the US\n\nThe manufacture of wrappers for the sending of newspapers or periodicals began in the U.S. in 1861. The first wrappers were rectangular pieces of paper with gum to seal it on one end and an embossed envelope stamp or indicium on it. By 1870, the form was that of a rectangle with the narrow side rounded and gummed at the top. They were manufactured from piles of 300 - 500 sheets of paper which were then cut to shape by a knife. After around 1900, they were cut individually from long ribbons of paper which had been printed with an embossed envelope die.\n\nIn the US, they were removed from the items for sale in 1934, though remainders were sold for several years after that. By 1940 most countries had discontinued their production due to declining demand. Because the recipient of a wrapped newspaper often tore it open and threw it away, untorn used wrappers, preferred by collectors, are scarce. Scarcer yet are wrappers with the original newspaper contents. Because of their larger size, even mint copies are often sold folded or creased which is also less desirable to collectors.\n\nMost postal stationery pieces are collected as entires, that is, the whole card, sheet or envelope. In the 19th century the practice was to collect \"cut squares\" (or \"cut-outs\" in the UK) which involved clipping the embossed indicia from a postal envelope. This destroyed the envelope. As a result, one cannot tell from a cut square what specific envelope it came from and, many times, the cancellation information. The manner in which the stamped envelope is cut out (defined by the term \"knife\") vanishes on a cut square. Thus most collectors prefer entires to cut squares.\n\nMany country-specific stamp catalogs list postal stationery and there are books devoted to the postal stationery of individual countries. The current, but now dated, principal encyclopedic work is the nineteen volume Higgins & Gage World Postal Stationery Catalog.\n\nCollectors of postal stationery may seek out postal stationery societies or study groups in other countries. These societies provide information, publications and guidance to those who are interested. They include:\n\n\n"}

He was involved in Hindi and Bengali cinema.\n\nAtorthy's initial schooling started at Brahmo School, Kolkata. He then studied variously at Duff School, Keshab Academy, City School and Brahma Boys Boarding and Day School, which were then under the University of Calcutta. His father, Mahesh Chandra Atorthy, was a propagator and writer of the Brahma Samaj.\n\nAtorthy was imaginative and fond of adventure from boyhood. Failing to do well in his studies, he ran away to Bombay. At Bombay he learnt to play the sitar under Ustad Karamatullah. Returning to Kolkata, he started working at a sports goods shop in Chowringee. Subsequently, he worked for the Baikali, Yadughar, Hindustan, bharatvarsha, Sangkalpa, Nachghar and bharati.\n\nHe was a noted novelist and playwrighter, author of many books including compilations of short stories, essays (e.g. on silent film, cf. Atorthy, 1990) and plays. Best- known literary work: \"Mahasthavir Jatak\" (1944), a fictional autobiography in four volumes noted for its irreverent portrayal of Calcutta’s early 20th-century élites. Among his other novels are \"Anarkali\" (1925), \"Bajikar\" (1922), \"Achalpather Jatri\" (1923), \"Chasir Meye\" (1924), \"Dui Ratri\" (1927) and \"Takht Taus\". Associated with literary journal Bharati; edited Nachghar, one of the first performing arts journals to take film seriously, with Hemendra Kumar Roy and film- maker Pashupati Chatterjee.\n\nFounded Betar Jagat, the journal of the AIR, Calcutta (1929). Started as scenarist and actor, using the pseudonym Krishna Haldar, at Indian Kinema Arts (Punarjanma, 1927; Chasher Meye, 1931). Remade Punarjanma in 1932. Joined B.N. Sircar's International Filmcraft as writer and assistant to Prafulla Roy (Chasher Meye is based on Atorthy's novel and script). Also scripted Nitin Bose's Buker Bojha (1930).\n\nPremankur entered the cinema world with a role in the Bangla film Punarjanma. First directed film, Dena Paona, was New Theatres' first talkie, made in direct competition with Madan Theatres' Jamai Sasthi (1931). Made several Urdu films as part of New Theatres' effort to enter the North Indian market, including the classic film of Agha Hashar Kashmiri's play \"Misar Kumari\" to \"Yahudi Ki Ladki\" (1933). His film versions of literary classics, e.g. from Saratchandra Chattopadhyay (Dena Paona), Rabindranath Tagore (Chirakumar Sabha) and Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay (Kapal Kundala), established the élite literary film genre intended to distinguish New Theatres' films from routine stage adaptations and remained important signifiers of high art in Bengali cinema. First Bengali film-maker to work in Western India, e.g. for Kolhapur Cinetone (1935) and for Imperial (1936). Credited with the supervision of H.K. Shivdasani's Yasmin (1935), made by the Krishna Studio.\n\n\n"}

For example, the factorial function \"n\"! is defined by the rules\nThis definition is valid for all \"n\", because the recursion eventually reaches the base case of 0. The definition may also be thought of as giving a procedure describing how to construct the function \"n\"!, starting from n = 0 and proceeding onwards with n = 1, n = 2, n = 3 etc..\n\nThe recursion theorem states that such a definition indeed defines a function. The proof uses mathematical induction.\n\nAn inductive definition of a set describes the elements in a set in terms of other elements in the set. For example, one definition of the set N of natural numbers is:\nThere are many sets that satisfy (1) and (2) - for example, the set {1, 1.649, 2, 2.649, 3, 3.649, ...} satisfies the definition. However, condition (3) specifies the set of natural numbers by removing the sets with extraneous members.\n\nProperties of recursively defined functions and sets can often be proved by an induction principle that follows the recursive definition. For example, the definition of the natural numbers presented here directly implies the principle of mathematical induction for natural numbers: if a property holds of the natural number 0, and the property holds of \"n\"+1 whenever it holds of \"n\", then the property holds of all natural numbers (Aczel 1978:742).\n\nMost recursive definitions have two foundations: a base case (basis) and an inductive clause.\n\nThe difference between a circular definition and a recursive definition is that a recursive definition must always have \"base cases\", cases that satisfy the definition \"without\" being defined in terms of the definition itself, and all other cases comprising the definition must be \"smaller\" (\"closer\" to those base cases that terminate the recursion) in some sense. In contrast, a circular definition may have no base case, and define the value of a function in terms of that value itself, rather than on other values of the function. Such a situation would lead to an infinite regress.\n\nThat recursive definitions are valid - meaning that a recursive definition identifies a unique function - is a theorem of set theory, the proof of which is non-trivial. Where the domain of the function is the natural numbers, sufficient conditions for the definition to be valid are that the value of formula_1 is given (base case) and that, for n>0, an algorithm is given for determining formula_2 in terms of formula_3 (inductive clause).\n\nMore generally, recursive definitions of functions can be made whenever the domain is a well-ordered set, using the principle of transfinite recursion. The formal criteria for what constitutes a valid recursive definition are more complex for the general case. An outline of the general proof and the criteria can be found in Munkres' 'Topology'.However,a specific case(domain is restricted to the positive integers instead of any well-ordered set) of the general recursive definition will be given below.\n\nLet formula_4 be a set and let formula_5 be an element of formula_6.If formula_7 is a function which assigns to each function formula_8 mapping a nonempty section of the positive integers into formula_6,an element of formula_6,then there exists a unique function formula_11 such that <br>\n\nformula_12<br>\n\nformula_13 for formula_14\n\nAddition is defined recursively based on counting\nMultiplication is defined recursively \nExponentiation is defined recursively \nBinomial coefficients are defined recursively\n\nThe set of prime numbers can be defined as the unique set of positive integers satisfying\nThe primality of the integer 1 is the base case; checking the primality of any larger integer \"X\" by this definition requires knowing the primality of every integer between 1 and \"X\", which is well defined by this definition. That last point can be proved by induction on \"X\", for which it is essential that the second clause says \"if and only if\"; if it had said just \"if\" the primality of for instance 4 would not be clear, and the further application of the second clause would be impossible.\n\nThe even numbers can be defined as consisting of\n\nIt is chiefly in logic or computer programming that recursive definitions are found. For example, a well formed formula (wff) can be defined as:\n\nThe value of such a recursive definition is that it can be used to determine whether any particular string of symbols is \"well formed\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is a major foreign language in the country and is used in many aspects of life. Russian is by far the most used non-official native language in Israel. The government and businesses often provide information in Russian, and it is semi-official in some areas with high concentration of Russian Jewish immigrants. The Russian-speaking population of Israel is the world's third-largest population of Russian native-speakers living outside the former Soviet Union territories after Germany and the United States, and the highest as a proportion of the population. As of 2013, 1,231,003 residents of the Post-Soviet states have immigrated to Israel since the fall of the Soviet Union. As of 2017, there are up to 1.5 million Russian-speaking Israelis out of total population of 8,700,000 (17.25%).\n\nThe first large scale immigration of Russian-speaking Soviet Jews to post-1948 Israel occurred during the 1970s, but the \"great migration\" did not start until the late 1980s, during the last years of the Soviet Union.\n\nAbout 100,000 Jews emigrated from the Soviet Union to Israel from 1971 to 1974. Most of them were from Georgia; the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; and areas annexed by the Red Army in 1939–1940, mostly Poland. Soviet authorities allowed this emigration by calling it \"family reunification,\" to avoid the appearance that anyone was unhappy living in the Soviet state. These emigrants held strongly Zionist views and took the opportunity to settle in their historic homeland. Less than half of those who emigrated in the 1970s wave came from Slavic countries, i.e., Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, even though about 80% of Soviet Jews lived there at the time.\n\nThe Soviet Union was generally anti-Semitic; Zionist activities inside its borders were considered treason that could lead to execution, and, after 1967, Israel was considered an enemy state. It was not until \"Perestroika\" that Jewish activists were given freedom to operate. The emigration that took place from 1989 to 1993 is described as a \"panic migration\", due to the socio-economic crisis in the Soviet states, rather than a migration of \"born-again\" Jews. Many of them did not have any relation to Judaism or Zionism in their former place of residence. Most immigrants of this period came from Russia and Ukraine, and to a lesser extent from Belarus and Central Asia.\n\nThe \"old immigrants\" of the 1970s, who mainly came to Israel for Zionist feelings, viewed people who came during the wave of the 1980s and 1990s as people escaping a harsh economic situation who did not have much appreciation for their new homeland. The last Soviet census of 1989 indicated 1,449,000 Jews living in the country, of which about 877,000 had moved to Israel by October 2000. The wave of immigration in this short period of time was the greatest influx of people to Israel since the date of its creation. Immigrants from the former Soviet Union composed 50%–70% of the newcomers. The number of people who came to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s outnumbered the number of people who came during the 1970s by four times, which made it harder for them to be integrated into the mainstream society of such a small country.\n\nAn estimated 250,000 of immigrants are not halachically Jewish (which only recognises maternal descent), but rather considered Jewish under the law of return due to having at least one Jewish grandparent, or being the spouse of Jewish immigrants who received Israeli citizenship according to the Law of Return.\n\nAlthough free Hebrew courses are offered to every immigrant, some immigrants did not take them. In 2013, about 26 percent of Russian immigrants did not speak fluent Hebrew. Russians often settle close to each other, forming Russian-speaking neighborhoods with store window advertisements in Russian and banks with at least a few Russian-speaking workers. Ashdod, the fifth largest city in Israel, absorbed a particularly large number of immigrants, accepting over 100,000 Soviet Jews from 1990 to 2001. The Yud-Yud Gimmel neighborhoods in southern Ashdod, where immigrants account for 75 percent of the population of 26,000, were dubbed \"Israel's Russian ghetto\".\n\nThe process of integration into mainstream Israeli society is slow, because many Russian-speaking adults prefer to not learn Hebrew and are reluctant to give up their Russian cultural background. Language professors Elana Shohamy and Bernard Spolsky attributed this to a \"strong loyalty to their ethnic language\".\n\nHayim Gordon describes the situation in his 2007 book \"Israel today\": \nToday, Russian is in a much better position than Arabic, which has a special official status in the country. The Russian-speaking adult population, which is less competitive in Hebrew than the youth, mostly tries to preserve the common Russian cultural background, teaching it to their children born in Israel. However, according to Shohamy and Spolsky, second generation Israelis of Russian origin \"do not receive a formal education in Russian\" and, as a result, \"language attrition is rapid\". Political scientist Ze'ev Khanin opined, \"The Russian-speaking community is identifiable, but it is part of the Israeli collective. The second generation is much more influenced by its Israeli experience than its Soviet past.\" In 2001, camp counselors in Ashdod volunteered to help youths accommodate to Israeli lifestyle, and those that participated in the program said that \"they feel Israeli in every respect\".\n\nRoughly 20 percent of Israel's population was born in Russia, and, as of 2013, the Russian-speaking community accounts for 15 percent of Israel's eligible voters. Ze'ev Khanin surmised that Russian Jews in Israel tend to be politically conservative, estimating that 50 to 60 percent support the Likud Beiteinu party.\n\nIsraeli journalist Lily Galili attributed this to being in part due to an unwillingness to make land concessions for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. She explained, \"They come from this huge empire to this tiny Israel and they say: 'Is that all, is that the country? And what, you want to give back the territories? Who gives up territory in the first place! And in this small country. You must be kidding!'\" Russian-speaking Israeli analyst Igor Khlopitsky stated that this also resulted from the Russian-speaking Israelis generally wanting quick results during times of turmoil, saying, \"Those who came after Perestroika had the Soviet mentality beaten out of them by the very difficult problems of the time. And where some other Israelis see the possibilities for discussion and dialogue, they just want to solve the problems swiftly.\"\n\nHebrew is the only official language of the State of Israel and Arabic has special status.\n\nRussian and a number of other immigrant languages are widely used in Israel, because ethnic Jews from dozens of countries from all around the world have settled in the area. Russian is the major immigrant language of Jews living in Israel. Since 1967, millions of Russian Jews have settled in the country, and a great influx of Jews from the post-Soviet states took place in the 1990s. Today, Russian is used in cultural events, the educational system and other public domains.\n\nBy 1999, about 5 to 10 percent of all jobs in Israel were held by Russian speakers. The Ministry of Transport published booklets and manuals in Russian. It is very likely to find Russian-speaking doctors at hospitals.\n\nMost Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union were highly educated with almost 45 percent of them having some kind of higher education.\n\nDespite the fact that the native language of a significant part of the country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called \"Na'leh 16\" included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.\n\nTraditionally, Russian speakers read newspapers and listen to radio more often than Hebrew speakers.\n\n\"Nasha strana\" was the major Russian-newspaper in Israel during the 1970s, when it competed with \"Tribuna\" for the immigrant reader. In 1989, there was only one daily in Russian, and 6 in 1996. Since the 2000s, the number of Russian-language newspapers started to decline due to the increasing number of television and online media. Israeli television provides daily translation in Hebrew, Arabic, and Russian. In 2002, the Israeli Russian-speaking commercial Channel 9 was launched. It is also known as Israel Plus. In November 2007, a typical digital package included 45 channels in foreign languages, with 5 in Russian. Today, there are four dailies, 11 weeklies, five monthlies and over 50 local newspapers published in Russian in Israel, with a total circulation of about 250,000 during weekends. Daily radio services in Russian are also available throughout Israel.\n\n\n\n"}

On the basis of the evidence of early sources, it can be assumed that there existed a Yukaghir dialect continuum, with what is today Tundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir at the extremes.\n\nTundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir are not mutually intelligible. Tundra Yukaghir has residual vowel harmony and a complex phonotactics of consonants, rich agglutinative morphology and is strictly head-final. It has practically no finite subordination and very few coordinate structures. Tundra Yukaghir has a split intransitive alignment system based on discourse-pragmatic features. In absence of narrow focus, the system is organised on a nominative–accusative basis; when focused, direct objects and subjects of intransitive verbs are co-aligned (special focus case, special focus agreement).\n\nThe long mid vowels are realized as diphthongs when stressed: they are , respectively.\n\n¹The uvular fricative is realized as a stop after .\n\nSyllable structure is CVC, i.e. up to one consonant can occur at the beginning or end of a word and up to two in the middle.\n\nTundra Yukaghir is largely head-final and dependent-marking: the default position for the verb is at the end of the clause, nouns are marked for case, adjectives precede nouns and relative clauses precede main clauses.\n\nCase assignment for core participants behaves in a broadly split-intransitive manner, though actual assignment is very complex, involving semantic role, focus, relative animacy of the participants (first or second person versus third), and nature of the noun itself. The assigned cases are primary (used for focused or high animacy nominative arguments), neutral (for low animacy nominative arguments and high animacy accusative ones), and focus case (most focused accusative arguments). Indexation of arguments on the verb is similarly conditioned by focus and animacy as well as mood.\n\nOblique cases include dative, instrumental, comitative, locative, ablative, prolative, and transformative, the latter indicating the intended use or function of an argument.\n\nThere is limited incorporation, used in reflexive constructions.\n\nTundra Yukaghir verbs are marked for switch reference. Besides indicating whether the verb of a following clause shares the same subject, the switch-reference markers also describe the temporal relationship between clauses, the connection between the actions involved, and in the case of different subjects, the person (first or second versus third) and number of the subject.\n\n"}
{"id": "10519668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10519668", "title": "Urbicide", "text": "Urbicide\n\nUrbicide is a term which literally translates (Latin: \"urbs\": city + Latin: \"caedere\" to cut, kill) as \"violence against the city\". The term was first coined by the author Michael Moorcock in 1963 and later used by critics of 1960s urban restructuring in the United States. Ada Louise Huxtable in 1972 and Marshall Berman in 1996 have written about urban restructuring (and destruction) in areas like the Bronx, and highlight the impacts of aggressive redevelopment on the urban social experience. The term has come into being in an age of rapid globalization and urbanization. This rapid globalization trend has led to the focus of violence and destruction in the context of the city rather than its surroundings. Especially after the events at Sarajevo, recognition has begun to be given to the cases of violence specifically directed to the destruction of an urban area. The exact constraints and definition of this term continue to be debated because the limits of this emerging concept make it extremely difficult to categorize events under the heading of urbicide. The question of intent also arises when discussing the limits of urbicide. The ability of term to cross a variety of fields such as international politics, anthropology, and sociology makes it particularly difficult to set a finite definition of urbicide which satisfies all these fields.\n\nThe term \"urbicide\" has its roots in the Latin word \"urbs\", meaning \"city\", and \"occido\", meaning \"to massacre\". In 1944, Raphael Lemkin defined genocide as \"a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves\". This term, however, failed to address violence not aimed at human bodies. The first recorded use of the term \"urbicide\" was by Michael Moorcock in the Elric novella \"Dead God's Homecoming\" (\"Science Fantasy\" #59, Nova Publishing, June 1963). In the wake of the destruction of Sarajevo, the term gained more common usage, examples being found in the works of Marshall Berman (1987) and Bogdan Bogdanović. In their 1992 publication \"Mostar '92\", a group of Bosnian architects from Mostar used the term urbicide to define the violence against the city fabric, such as the destruction of the Mostar bridge, a usage consistent with Marshall Berman's prior use of the term to describe similar acts of violence in Bosnia. Urbicide is increasingly being used by architects, urban planners, scholars and historians to help describe and understand the contemporary and historic wars where cities can no longer be considered safe havens from war, but rather are part of the battlefield. \n\nSome people argue that urbicide should be understood as a part of genocide, as to destroy people's homes is to destroy them. In his book \"Urbicide\", Martin Coward argues along a similar line. Rather than use urbicide for all violence against the city, Coward uses the term to denote violence which seeks to annihilate difference through the destruction of the material foundation of that difference. The urban is meant to imply the material foundation of heterogeneity (being with others as being with otherness), and he interprets some instances of destruction of the city as an attempt to destroy the material foundations of that heterogeneity. Urbicide would then share the annihilatory character of genocide, but not necessarily its focus on human beings as the object of destruction.\n\nThe definition of urbicide is interdependent on the definitions of city and violence. In many urbicidal incidents, one or both of these definitions has been removed from the situation's context by the perpetrator. Either the \"city\" receiving the violence has been demoted from its status as \"city\", or the violent act is not considered violent. The meaning of the words city and violence therefore become highly important when classifying an act as urbicidal.\n\nA city is an area consisting of numerous institutions, residents, industries, and businesses supported by large infrastructure and a dense and diverse population. A city can be framed in numerous ways. For example, it can be thought of as an economic system, in which all social relations stem from a market economy, and the city is produced and shaped by the market. A city can also be thought of as a state of mind, in which all people who live in the city share the same consciousness. Similarly, it can be seen as an aggregation of different social/cultural forms, making cities a center for heterogeneity. Finally, a city can be seen from an architectural perspective, as a conglomeration of masses and spaces. As Henri Lefebvre states, \"a city is, therefore, whatever is experienced, known, represented, constructed, or destroyed as a city.\"\nViolence is typically defined as, \"a behaviour involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill\" (Compact Oxford Dictionary). However, when defining violence sociologists, historians, philosophers and other scholars have identified other less direct forms of violence that should also be considered. Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Philippe Bourgois write in their book \"Violence in War and Peace\" that \"Violence can never be understood solely in terms of its physicality – force, assault, or the infliction of pain – alone. Violence also includes assaults on the person hood, dignity, sense of worth or value of the victim. The social and cultural dimensions of the violence are what gives violence its power and meaning.\"\n\nSome of the other categories are structural violence, symbolic violence, and violence enacted by the government through laws or actions. Structural violence occurs when the structure of a society causes the violence. Examples of this include laws that create unequal access to public amenities or affect different citizens based on their status in society. Symbolic violence concerns socially accepted norms that are ingrained over time such as the roles of different classes, genders and ethnic groups. Finally political violence addresses the harm the government can inflict by their actions either through neglect or action. All of these forms of violence can also be characterized in urbicide. \n\nWhile physical destruction of a city's buildings is the most obvious form of urbicide, it can also occur in less noticeable ways. Governments redefining areas of the city as slums or \"illegitimate\" can lead to an unequal treatment of citizens. For people living in these areas they have been denied their citizenship. How a government zones a city can also generate violence. While not directly causing harm, certain zoning combinations could increase violence, decrease the value of properties, and force poorer people into an undesirable neighborhood.\n\nThe hybrid nature of the term urbicide suggests that it is either a radical framework through which to view the historical destruction of cities, or something appropriate only to the \"now\" and has mandatory qualities in the present. Whereas in its first modern manifestations the targeting and destruction of cities was seen as something new, outside the traditional rules of European warfare, Marshall Berman, an American Marxist writer and political theorist, proposes that urbicide is the oldest story in the world. In his view, the Old Testament books of Jeremiah and Lamentations appropriately cover urbicide, or mark its beginnings. In later times the Roman Empire imposed the complete destruction of Jerusalem and a similarly devastating Carthaginian peace, though these proved less than permanent. Nonetheless, Berman's view of potential \"urbicidal\" events is very much within the Marxist historical \"telos\", which suppresses the contingency of urbicide in history, or rather, its own \"telos\". \n\nMany cities are in some sense imperial cities, having created an empire (Babylon, Rome), or been created by one (Persepolis, Cairo, Philadelphia) or greatly expanded (Byzantium, Delhi) or have become the capital of one (Peking, London) or received special privileges from an empire, for example as Free Imperial Cities. Thus there are perspectives that see urbicide as part of broader imperialist goals, for example in the elimination of cities by Communist Cambodia. Writers and geographers such as Mike Davis, Nurhan Abujidi and Stephen Graham represent some of these currents. The Siege of Sarajevo, which led to the \"coining\" of urbicide, stands as the most symbolic historical event representative of urbicide. Recent events in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Zimbabwe, post-Katrina New Orleans, and Iraq also stand as significant urbicidal examples, and can be taken as a broad spectrum of \"violence against the city,\" indicating the fluidity or multi-faceted discourse of urbicide.\n\nThe siege of Vukovar was an 87-day military campaign aimed against the eastern Croatian city of Vukovar led by the Yugoslav People's Army, supported by various Serbian paramilitary forces between August and November 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence. Indiscriminate bombardment of Vukovar, in which up to a million shells were fired on the city, led to destruction of three quarters of all neighborhoods. \nAmong them were schools, hospitals, churches, public institutions’ facilities, factories, medieval Eltz Castle and house of the Nobel-winning author Lavoslav Ružička. Several sources, like the Youth Initiative for Human Rights in Serbia, described the systematic destruction of the city as urbicide. Youth Initiative for Human Rights in Serbia also criticized the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for not reaching a verdict for the destruction of Vukovar. Slobodan Milošević was indicted for, inter alia, \"wanton destruction\" of the city, but died before a verdict was reached. Goran Hadžić was also indicted in the same category and is on trial.\n\nViolence in Sarajevo was a product of the Bosnian War, which lasted from 1992–1995 in which Serb forces of the Republika Srpska and the Yugoslav People's Army besieged Sarajevo. This region was very ethnically diverse, providing homes for both Serbs and Muslim Slavs. The violence is sometimes referred to as ethnic cleansing which ended in some of the worst violence this region has ever seen. Ultimately, urbicide resulted in the complete annihilation of Sarajevo's built environment. This broke down the city's infrastructure and denied thousands of civilians food, water, medicine, etc. In the wake of this violence, Sarajevo's Civilians also became victims of human rights offenses including rape, execution, and starvation. The Bosnian government declared the Siege over in 1996.\n\nWhile the term \"urbicide\" finds its genesis in the urban destruction and targeting associated with the Bosnian Wars of the early 1990s, its meaning(s) develops historically and in the present. Recent events in Zimbabwe, while falling under the definition of urbicide as selective violence and destruction against cities, also positions urbicide outside the dynamics of genocidal warfare. Operation Murambatsvina or \"Operation Restore Order\" was a countrywide program of targeted violence against cities, towns, peripheral urban areas, and resettled farms, resulting in the destruction of housing, trading markets, and other \"collective\" structures. It was a large-scale operation, strategically resulting in the displacement of over 700,000 refugees, and \"knowingly\" manufacturing a massive humanitarian crisis. Beyond the obvious violations of human rights, Operation Murambatsvina is striking in its abilities to literally unhinge the urban and rural poor from the collective structures integral to everyday, grounded existence in favor of dispersal, but without active state measures to reinstitute these people within governable spaces. Clearly, Zimbabwe's Operation Murambatsvina is urbicidal, yet a more important question is whether an urbicidal framework seeks a different subtext?\n\nThe destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 has been interpreted as the culmination of political and policy-driven urbicide that has been played out over many decades of corrupt politics, exemplified by leaders such as William J. Jefferson which led to waste and outright theft of civic funds by elected officials from all socioeconomic backgrounds. While natural disasters such as Katrina cannot be considered urbicidal in and of themselves, such disasters can, due to flawed governmental legislation, affect socioeconomic groups disproportionately. In the case of New Orleans, the areas of the city that were hit hardest included neighborhoods from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Areas housing members of the lowest socioeconomic classes lacked the resources to rebuild and re-establish their communities. Higher income neighborhoods were able to raise funds for additional security and civic improvements through tax levees and private fund raising efforts. Impoverished neighborhoods dependent upon city's resources were unable to successfully re-establish themselves without federal Hurricane Katrina disaster relief. According to urbicide scholar Andrew Herscher, \"Katrina's effects…were but the last and most visible traces of a chronic disaster, an urbicide fabricated not by military action but by policy and ideology.\"\n\nAlHakam Shaar and Robert Templer proposed that the deliberate destruction of Aleppo during the Battle of Aleppo was a form of \"urbicide\".\n\nHuman rights discourse provides another lens in which we can view urbicide, especially through the use of The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Using the term urbicide, usually refers to violence and destruction of buildings and architecture, but when also using the UN's Declaration along with urbicide, the focus is instead on people. Looking at violent acts and observing how they affect people, their culture and their safety inevitably centers on human rights and may often carry more validity for these urbicidal acts to also be cases of human rights violations.\n\nThe following cases are viewed here with a greater focus on the human rights aspect of them. The term urbicide can still apply, but human rights language may allow for a more familiar approach to these cases as many people are already aware of the general rights that people hold. These rights are explicitly stated here to fully demonstrate how fundamental rights are being violated as part of urbicide:\n\nArticle 3 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person and Article 5 states that no one shall be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. However, 20,000 Muslim women and girls were raped by Serbs, thousands were missing and/or executed. When using the term urbicide, human rights should be included because atrocities like this also affect the culture and feeling of the city. They must be taken into account when the urbicidal affects of bombings and military actions in the region are being examined because they show that the conflict was more than simply destroying the physical city buildings; there was destruction of people, their safety and of their communities.\n\nThe rights of 700,000 Zimbabweans were violated as they were forced from their urban homes and were left to create new lives for themselves during Operation Murambatsvina in May 2005 . Clearly this breaks the UN's Article 25 which says: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. The government forcibly removed these citizens from where they were living knowingly displaced them, leaving them without resources and access to food, shelter and health care.\n\nAs of now there is no explicit language mentioning urbicide in international and humanitarian law. As the term has been coined and interpreted only recently, during the Yugoslav war in the 1990s, it has not reached public consciousness and public discourse to such extent as to be an instantiated into international law. If genocide and urbicide, however, are synonymous terms, as some theorists propose, it could be argued that urbicide is already prohibited by international law. It can also be argued that urbicide, as destruction of urban spaces and human habitations, is made illegal under international law and humanitarian law through the effects of other laws dealing with destruction of human-made environment and people's dependency upon it. Such laws are the rights to adequate housing, the right to life and privacy, to mental integrity, and to the freedom of movement. The most salient example of Sarajevo, where the term urbicide partly originated, clearly demonstrates the violation of these basic human rights on the civilian population of the city. Testimonies of the urbicide in Sarajevo, in the cultural production of confessional literature during the siege, clearly show the dramatic plunge in the standard of living, the overtaking and militarization of the public space, and the daily struggle of the citizens to get basic supplies such as food and water. In other cases, such as the Porta Farm evacuation and demolition of settlements by the Harare local government, there is evidence of violation of these basic human rights as specified by the International Law and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights . Despite the specified violations, however, it might be useful to apply, as with genocide, the umbrella term urbicide for these and other cases of urban destruction.\n\nThe prospects for a codified prohibition of urbicide might benefit from differentiating the term's legal articulation from human rights law, just as urbicide conceptually separates itself from human rights. With the city as the site of urbicide, the traditional nation-state parties to international legislation might not suffice alone as stake-holders in any legal process, customary or otherwise. However, too much localizing of the criminalization of urbicide risks exonerating by inaction the governments often implicated as aggressors against the city and its citizens. It is often against their power interest to prosecute urbicide or to establish any form of judicial framework that deals explicitly with violations of such nature.\n\nThe inclusion of governments into the process is desirable, but their willingness to submit to another kind of scrutiny: particularly under the broad definitions of structural violence that often enter discourses on urbicide. They could presumably make their way into the legal discourses, as well.\n\nThe lack of explicit terminology that would address the destruction of cities in legal terms on the international level makes it unlikely that the international courts will take the issue more seriously. The problem is also with the enforcement of these laws on the international level, which have previously unenforced, even the human rights laws already in place.\n\nDecisions of the International court, such as the case of reparations to Bosnia by the Serbian government for crimes against humanity, in which the court, in February 2007, acquitted Serbia of the duty to give reparations, perhaps demonstrate the further need to distinguish between urbicide and genocide. In the case of Sarajevo, where the case of genocide, as legally understood, could not be unequivocally applied to cases such as the Siege of Sarajevo, the concept of urbicide might provide a better interpretive framework for the violence inflicted upon the Sarajevo populace and their urban environment, such as the shared public space and the architecture of the city. The goal of such violence may have not been to destroy a minority population and their cultural and symbolic space, as in cases of genocide but to fragment the heterogeneous population of the city into homogeneous enclaves based on the ethnicity of the population. Thus, the violence is not directed towards an ethnicity per se, but towards the city as a heterogeneous space where different cultural identities can live and interact without antagonism.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A precocious, award-winning, young author in interwar Romania, he was involved in editing several literary magazines. Attracted into left-wing democratic politics and the Social Democratic Party (PSDR), he camouflaged his views while working for the fascist press under dictatorial regimes, but returned in 1944 to manage the PSDR's \"Libertatea\" newspaper. Witnessing first-hand the gradual communist takeover, Baciu managed to have himself assigned to a diplomatic posting in Switzerland, and ultimately defected in 1948. A resident and then citizen of Brazil, and a traveler throughout Latin America, he wrote works in Portuguese, Spanish, English and German, as well as in his native Romanian.\n\nInvolved with the Congress for Cultural Freedom and a friend of independent socialists such as Juan Bosch, Baciu spoke out against South American communism and criticized Fidel Castro. He eventually moved to the United States, as a professor at the University of Washington, and, from 1964, the University of Hawaii. He put out the international magazine \"Mele\", which, although rudimentarily printed and little circulated, remains a noted source of information about avant-garde writers of the Romanian diaspora, from Andrei Codrescu to Dolfi Trost and Sesto Pals. Baciu was also a preeminent historian and anthologist of South and Central American surrealism, as well as a translator of Latin American literature into Romanian and German.\n\nȘtefan Baciu was born in Brașov, some months before the city became part of Greater Romania. His was a multicultural intellectual family. His father was the ethnic Romanian Ioan Baciu, a product of Austro-Hungarian schooling, was at the time a teacher of German at the Șaguna National College. He is remembered at the co-author of a pioneering introductory Romanian textbook for the benefit of Saxons and Hungarians. In 1930, he built for his family the \"Yellow House\" in Lunca Plăieșului residential property, which had recently been opened for settlement. The poet's mother, Elisabeta, was the daughter of the forestry engineer Arthur Sager. Baciu's sister, Ioana Veronica, had a successful career in the theater. Through the Sagers, Ștefan and Ioana were of Jewish descent. Raised Romanian Orthodox, and still a practicing believer in the 1960s, Baciu considered himself a \"cosmopolitan\" one.\n\nBaciu was a precocious child. Bookish from an early age, despite being heavily myopic, he discovered Romanian and German poetic anthologies, including Kurt Pinthus' expressionistic chrestomathy, \"Menscheitsdämerung\". In addition to German, he taught himself French, English, Spanish and Portuguese. A student of his father's Șaguna National College, where he earned top grades, he made friends with two of his teachers, writers Octav Șuluțiu and Emil Cioran. Șuluțiu would later refer to Baciu as one of the most characteristic poets of Transylvania region.\n\nBaciu made his editorial debut as a teenager, with German- and Romanian-language poems published in the local reviews \"Klingsor\" and \"Răboj\". In September 1933, having been denied sponsorship of a literary magazine by Șaguna College, he set up his own, avant-garde sheet called \"Start\". It was indebted to surrealist automatism and by André Gide's rebellious philosophy. \"Start\" functioned as a local satellite of I. Valerian's \"Viața Literară\", which had appointed Baciu its official correspondent and publicity agent for the whole of Transylvania. Struggling with financial difficulties, \"Start\" did not survive beyond its second issue. Baciu moved on to publish other magazines, alongside Vintilă Horia, Mihai Beniuc, and Ovid Caledoniu: \"Stilet\" (\"Stiletto\"), then \"Meșterul Manole\" (named after the folk legend hero). Additionally, he was a contributor to literary magazines and newspapers across Romania, including \"Gând Românesc\", \"Glasul Bucovinei\", \"Rampa\", and George Ivașcu's \"Manifest\".\n\nAt age seventeen, Baciu had his \"Poemele poetului tânăr\" (\"Poems of the Young Poet\") picked up in a \"young poets' anthology\", and put out by the official publishing company, Editura Fundațiilor Regale. He was presented with the company's own Young Writers Award and received the Romanian Writers' Society Poetry Prize. He followed up in 1936 with \"Poeme de dragoste\" (\"Love Poems\"), published by \"Familia\" of Oradea, and in 1937 with \"Micul dor\" (\"A Tiny Longing\"). Also that year, he was included in the anthology \"13 poeți\", with Horia, Caledoniu, Constantin Virgil Gheorghiu, Simion Stolnicu, Dumitru Gherghinescu-Vania and various others.\n\nYoung Baciu was soon received into the cultural elite of Bucharest, befriending the likes of Păstorel Teodoreanu and Ion Minulescu. Alongside Caledoniu, George Petcu, Maria Banuș, Laurențiu Fulga and some others, Baciu was also drawn into the \"White Nights Manifesto\" circle, which sought to promote young literature. Also faced with financial troubles, and unsuccessful in its bid to receive state funding, the circle closed shop in 1938.\n\nBaciu had since enlisted at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Law, whence he graduated in 1941. His college years overlapped with the demise of Romanian democracy and several authoritarian experiments, the first of which was a National Renaissance Front dictatorship. By late 1938, Baciu had begun collaborating in the semi-official newspaper, \"Sfarmă-Piatră\", published by the fascist sympathizer Nichifor Crainic. He had a literary history column, \"Cronici germane\" (\"German Chronicles\"), with which he aimed to popularize \"that superb German Romanticism\". He was in correspondence with a more senior poet, Emil Giurgiuca, offering to popularize Giurgiuca's work \"in \"Sfarmă-Piatră\" or wherever\". Also in 1938, Baciu collected his translations from Georg Trakl, which came out at Editura Frize in Iași.\n\nHaving openly supported the Iron Guard as a radical fascist alternative to the establishment, \"Sfarmă-Piatră\" was also falling into disfavor with the National Renaissance Front regime. Early in 1939, following bloody clashes between the Front and the Guardists, \"Sfarmă-Piatră\" was outlawed. Baciu moved to the more mainstream \"Universul\", becoming its editor and resuming \"Cronici germane\" in its literary supplement. He also held the literary criticism column, taking over from Ștefan Augustin Doinaș.\n\nDuring the early stages of World War II, Crainic gave Baciu the office of editorial secretary at \"Gândirea\" magazine, but sacked him upon finding out about his Social Democratic loyalties. According to communist sources, Baciu was himself an affiliate or sympathizer of the Iron Guard—a claim that has since been disputed; Baciu's PSDR membership and his mother's Jewishness disqualified him for such an enterprise. By his own account, Baciu was a \"malagambist\", meaning that he followed the zoot-clad jazzman Sergiu Malagamba and had cosmopolitan, Americophile tastes. He did however befried the Guard's poet laureate, Radu Gyr, helping him publish in \"Gândirea\" even after the Guard's violent fall from grace in early 1941.\n\nUpon his graduation, Baciu became translator for the Institute of Statistics (under Sabin Manuilă), cultural adviser for the General Council of Bucharest, and publisher for the companies Gorjanul and Publicom. His poetic work was collected in the volumes \"Drumeț în anotimpuri\" (\"A Traveler through Seasons\", 1939), \"Căutătorul de comori\" (\"The Treasure Hunter\", 1939), \"Cetatea lui Bucur\" (\"Bucur's Citadel\", 1940), and \"Muzica sferelor\" (\"Music of the Spheres\", 1943). Attracted by the prospects of a good pay in the only thriving literary industry of the war years, he began contributing to the humorous press. He debuted in Virgil Slăvescu's \"Păcală\", as \"Grigore Cumpănașu\", and later held columns in \"Veselia\" and Ion Anestin's \"Gluma\".\n\nWhile at university, Baciu had met and fallen in love with Mira Simian (born 1920). The daughter of Dinu Simian, a National Peasants' Party politician from Vâlcea County, heir to a tanning and footwear-making empire, and his Polish wife, Mira attended the Bucharest Faculty of Letters, then worked as a pharmacist in Râmnicu Vâlcea. She married Baciu upon the war's end.\n\nThe August 23, 1944 Coup unsealed Romania's alliance with Nazi Germany, and brought back democracy, but also signified the onset of Soviet occupation. Shortly after the legalization of political parties, Baciu became editor of the Social Democratic press organ \"Libertatea\" (\"Liberty\"). From October 1944 to December 1945, he edited his own illustrated satirical review, \"Humorul\" (\"Humor\"). Meanwhile, he also put out new selections from his poetry: \"Cântecul mulțimii\" (\"Song of the Crowd\"), with a preface by Ion Pas, came out at the PSDR party press in 1944; \"Caiet de vacanță\" (\"Notebook for the Holidays\") at Unirea of Râmnicu Vâlcea in 1945. His circle of acquaintances grew to include some members of the Bucharest surrealist circle, in particular Sesto Pals (who was Baciu's lifelong friend) and Dolfi Trost.\n\nWith his party falling under the influence of Romanian Communists, Baciu remained close to the independent pro-Western wing, under Constantin Titel Petrescu. As he would note in 1992, Baciu had always been \"an adept of democratic socialism\". He referred to Petrescu as \"the tocsin-sounder of the great perils that were knocking on our door, perils not just for the existence of social democracy, but also of Romania's very existence as a free democratic state\".\n\nBaciu described with alarm the rapid communization of his writer friends, recording Beniuc's enthusiasm at seeing liberal demonstrators being repressed with machine guns. He also witnessed the desperation of his friend Gyr, who attempted suicide in Râmnicu Vâlcea. However, according to literary historian Mircea Popa, Baciu's \"Libertatea\" editorials were of that kind \"that would later shame him\": young Baciu ridiculed the prewar regime as an era of conformity and \"nothingness\", and even praised socialist realism. At the time, Communist Party politicians tempted him with offers to become Prefect or theater manager. Baciu was present at the PSDR Congress of March 10, 1946, which resulted in the party's electoral alliance with the Communists. His testimony describes Petrescu's anti-fusion speech as the point of view of a \"good and courageous Romanian\". Baciu further recalls: \"I walked [Petrescu] back to his home alongside some hundreds of partisans\".\n\nIn October 1946, owing to his Social Democratic credentials, Baciu was appointed press officer of the Romanian Embassy in Bern. The ambassador was Șerban Voinea, a PSDR theoretician. Baciu conceived of this assignment as a safe haven from communism, but was still troubled about leaving Romania and his relatives. He brought up the issue in conversations with Petrescu, who advised him: \"Forget [Mira's] pharmacy, choose freedom.\" His appointment became the object of disputes between Communist-controlled agencies and Foreign Affairs, which was still controlled by an ally, Gheorghe Tătărescu. As Baciu recalls, Tătărescu gave him and his wife tacit backing, without signing any papers, and discreetly handed them their diplomatic passports.\n\nOn November 5, the Bacius crossed into Hungary semi-clandestinely, knowing that they risked being returned at the border. The Petru Groza government was only informed later of their arrival in Bern. Like Voinea, Baciu had open disagreements with his Bucharest superiors, complaining that his efforts to publicize Romanian literature in the Swiss \"workers' press\" were not being supported by the Romanian state. He wrote for the editorial section of \"Tribune de Genève\", to dissuade Swiss fears about the stabilization of the Romanian leu. The communist authorities later accused him of purposefully withholding information, \"thus giving reactionaries reason to minimize this important reform\". In late 1947, just before the proclamation of a Romanian communist republic, Voinea resigned his posting. Baciu, who was recalled and assigned to a new post in Sofia, opted to discontinue his work in diplomacy and demand political asylum in Switzerland. He was advised to do so by a friend, Victor Popescu (son of \"Universul\" editor Stelian Popescu).\n\nThe Bacius registered their case with the International Refugee Organization (IRO), who processed them to determine if they were or had been undercover agents of a secret service. During the interval, Baciu was publishing essays and in \"Literarische Tat\", and Mira was working for the Zytglogge pharmacy. The Bacius simultaneously applied for asylum in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela (meanwhile, Mira's uncles had managed to escape to Argentina).\n\nCleared by the IRO in early 1949, the Bacius were given asylum rights in Brazil, and arrived at Rio de Janeiro in March. They had a rough start in the new country, and struggled to make ends meet. Ștefan Baciu resumed his work in poetry, translating Latin American novellas into German and Raúl Otero Reiche's \"América\" into Romanian, and publishing his own surrealist works, including \"Analiza cuvântului dor\" (Valle Hermoso, 1951). In late 1952, alongside Faust Brădescu, he was editing \"Înșir-te Mărgărite\", a magazine for the Romanian Brazilian community, which also reached Romanian communities from Argentina to Francoist Spain. Its stated purpose was the preservation and publicizing of Romanian poetry and prose. Romania's Securitate secret police, which was following his movements, noted Brădescu's Iron Guard affiliation as a sign of Baciu's own fascism.\n\nAlso in 1953, Baciu was made editor of the foreign politics page at Carlos Lacerda's \"Tribuna da Imprensa\". According to the Securitate, this was a \"newspaper of the fascist kind\". He published occasional contributions to \"Revista da Semana\", \"Diário Carioca\", and \"Maquis\", and, in 1957, two volumes of his Portuguese-language poetry: \"Aula de solidão\" (\"Lesson in Solitude\"), \"Dois Guatemaltecos\" (\"Two Guatemalans\"). Meanwhile, Mira Baciu worked as a translator for the Deputies' Chamber.\n\nWith \"Tribuna da Imprensa\" credentials, Baciu traveled across Latin America. In Mexico, he interviewed Natalia Sedova, widow of Leon Trotsky. In 1956, he was at Lima, where he met the Romanian writer-violinist Grigore Cugler. The two began a correspondence, with Baciu persuading Cugler to republish his 1930s avant-garde stories. He prepared for publishing Cugler's \"Afară de unul singur\", but the manuscript was lost in the process (although an earlier print was eventually recovered in 1998). Baciu also embarked on a mission to popularize Romanian avant-garde writers, publishing Spanish and Portuguese essays about Urmuz and Constant Tonegaru.\n\nBy then, Baciu was also involved with the anti-authoritarian left-wing movement on the South American continent. As he saw it, the \"caudillo\" regimes of Alfredo Stroessner, Juan Perón or Anastasio Somoza were generally equivalent to Eastern European Stalinism. Together with Salvadorean diplomat Rafael Barraza Monterrosa, the Bacius managed a Panhispanist association, called Ruy Barbosa Circle, building personal contacts with Juan Bosch, the exiled Dominican socialist, and Carlos Mérida, the Guatemalan painter. In 1956, he had an encounter with Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro, and became a sympathizer of his 26th of July Movement.\n\nThe Bacius were eventually granted Brazilian citizenship, and became fully integrated in Brazil's cultural life. The couple counted among their writer friends Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Manuel Bandeira and Cecília Meireles. In April 1958, Baciu, Meireles and Bandeira were among the 42 intellectuals who set up a Brazilian chapter of the anticommunist Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), which, from 1959, put out the Portuguese-language review \"Cadernos Brasileiros\". The organization was in part funded by the Central Intelligence Agency, through its Paris agent, John Hunt (with whom Baciu corresponded), and answered directly to the Spaniard Julián Gorkin. Baciu joined the staff of \"Cadernos\" as editor in chief (with Afrânio Coutinho as editorial manager) and was General Secretary of the CCF until August 1962; Mira was the Executive Secretary.\n\nBaciu was with Bosch in Venezuela, celebrating Rómulo Betancourt's victory in the election of December 1958. Together with Bosch, he organized a negative campaign against the Republic of Cuba, but Bosch refused any explicit endorsement of Castro's guerrilla. In January 1959, following the success of the Cuban Revolution, Baciu was invited by the new government in Havana, to report on the work of the revolutionary tribunals. He declined the invitation but, later that year, he made his way there to interview Castro. He recorded in particular Castro's disdain for the Cuban Communists. In March, he happened to meet Castro's communist inspiration, Che Guevara, but they only discussed literature.\n\nAlso in 1959, Baciu published in Rio the essay \"Um continente em busca de uma doutrina\" (\"A Continent Searching for a Doctrine\"). In 1960, he was awarded honorary citizenship of Rio. He was working on the book of memoirs in Portuguese, \"Bucareste-Estação Norte\" (\"Bucharest-Northern Station\"), which came out at Edições o Cruzeiro in 1961. Meanwhile, Baciu's Romanian relatives were suffering under communist persecution. Dinu Simian was mistreated and tortured in Sighet prison, where he eventually died; Dinu's wife, Constanța, was also detained, and, upon her 1962 release, had to struggle to make ends meet. In 1962, through the intercession of Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek, Mira Baciu persuaded the Romanian authorities to grant her mother safe passage to Brazil.\n\nWith his 1961 reportage \"Cortina de hierro sobre Cuba\" (\"The Iron Curtain over Cuba\"), prefaced by Salvador de Madariaga, Baciu made public his criticism of Castroist communism, and condemned its spread to other Latin American nations. He rendered it even more explicit in the poem \"Eu nu îl cînt pe Che\" (\"I Do Not Sing for Che\"), known in Spanish as \"Yo no canto al Ché\". This change of attitudes was radical, as Baciu moved to confront the communists directly, and, in his letters to Gorkin, stated his desire to purge the CCF itself of \"camouflaged\" Brazilian Communists. Such ideas alarmed the CIA, since they risked alienating the anticommunist left. John Hunt and Keith Botsford repeatedly asked Baciu to focus on anti-Casto, rather than \"right-wing\", propaganda (Hunt referred to Baciu as \"a right-wing democratic socialist\", a Betancourt associate, and a \"maniac\"). By then, the Brazilian CCF was vulnerable, its CIA connections brought up for public debate by communist intellectuals like Jorge Amado and Egídio Squeff. Although he did not formally adhere to any Romanian anticommunist organization, Baciu was in correspondence with Constantin Vișoianu and the Romanian National Committee, publishing anticommunist essays in the latter's \"România\" gazette.\n\nAllegedly, Baciu found himself threatened by the Cuban Intelligence Directorate. However, it was Baciu's extreme anticommunism that prompted Hunt to demand his resignation and appoint Vicente de Paulo Barretto as the new CCF General Secretary. Baciu later commented that the CCF had committed \"suicide\" by moderating its tone, noting that its \"constructive dialogue with proven communists\" was a moral victory for \"Eurocommunism\".\n\nBaciu's Rio colleagues backed him in his bid for the Brazilian literature chair at the University of Washington. He obtained it, and moved to Seattle, where Mira began her own career as a Spanish-language teacher. However, Mira detested the Oceanic climate, and the couple was often taking trips back to Latin America. In 1963, Baciu and his wife were in Santo Domingo, celebrating Bosch's victory in the Dominican presidential suffrage. Afterwards, they also visited neighboring Haiti, where Baciu was trying to recover for publishing the obscure surrealist works of Clément Magloire-Saint-Aude. The same year, Baciu published in Mexico City his poetic cycle \"Poemele poetului pribeag\" (\"Poems of the Outcast Poet\").\n\nIn 1964, Baciu obtained a professorship in Latin American literature at the newly founded University of Hawaii. He enjoyed his work there, but felt bad about the smaller attendance his classes inevitably received. In 1965, the Bacius set up their own magazine, \"International Poetry Letter – Mele\" (from the Hawaiian for \"song\"), which sought to establish connections between Latino, French, American and Romanian literature. Although noted for the quality of its illustrations, \"Mele\" had a very minor circulation, with at most 300 copies per issue, all of them xerographed by Baciu's students.\n\n\"Mele\" sought to popularize Romanian authors, and, doubling as a publishing house, put out periodic selections from Baciu's own poems in Romanian and Spanish. Baciu helped discover and popularize Andrei Codrescu, the neo-avant-garde Romanian exile writer. In 1967, the Bacius' home in Honolulu hosted Valeriu Anania, the writer and abbot of the Romanian Orthodox Church in America. A former Iron Guard man and prisoner of the communists, released with the spell of liberalization in 1964, Anania was treating his depression in Hawaii. He was putting to paper a novel and poetry that he had \"written inside his brain\" while in jail, and doing research into Hawaiian folklore. Anania later recalled that Mira Baciu had fallen in love with him, and that he had to fend off her advances while remaining friends with her and her husband.\n\nBaciu returned to Romanian-language publishing with the 1967 \"Ukulele\", put out by George Uscătescu's Editura Destin in Spain. He also made a comeback to Portuguese letters with the 1966 essay \"Manuel Bandeira de corpo inteiro\" (\"The Complete Manuel Bandeira\"). He followed up with a 1967 essay on the politics of Juan Bosch and Spanish-language poetry volumes, \"Semblanza y explicación de Latinoamérica\" (\"A Profile and Explanation of Latin America\") of 1968 and the 1973 \"Nasserismo\" (\"Nasserism\"). In 1972, he published in Madrid's \"Colecția Start\" a complete collection of his Romanian poems. They featured a preface by Lucian Boz and a portrait by Marcel Janco. Baciu also translated Romanian poetry into Spanish, and published several anthologies, beginning with the 1969 \"Poetas rumanos\". He was under contract with publishing houses in West Germany, such as Peter Hammer and Neues Leben, translating for them five volumes of poetry by Ernesto Cardenal.\n\nInspired by an encounter with French surrealist Benjamin Péret, Baciu had begun a vast work of research into the history of Latin American avant-garde literature, and spent some time in Peru and Bolivia. By his own account, he interviewed \"my great friend\" Tristán Marof, Luis Alberto Sánchez, Javier Sologuren and Emilio Adolfo von Westphalen, and helped rediscover the anticommunist surrealist Rafael Méndez Dorich. As noted by Sologuren, Baciu's studies also helped revive interest in the poetry of César Moro. In Argentina, Baciu befriended Aldo Pellegrini, who let him discover early avant-garde texts by Jorge Luis Borges and \"the extraordinary\" Antonio Porchia. Pellegrini also introduced him to Enrique Gómez Correa and the Chilean surrealist scene. Introduced to Jean Charlot by Mérida, Baciu researched the history of Mexican muralism, and discovered the proto-surrealism of José Guadalupe Posada.\n\nHe was still following with interest the work of writers in Romania, and published his translations of neomodernist Romanian literature in a special issue of Peru's \"Haraui\" review. Baciu also followed the work of Romanians who translated Latino literature into Romanian. He found these attempts inauthentic and superficial, and criticized them in the 1970 essay \"Brazilia masacrata\". To the irritation of Editura Dacia publishers, he mailed them copies of this critique. Baciu later exposed communist censorship, noting for instance the cuts that had been made into the published diaries of Șuluțiu, and the exclusion of concrete poetry from the Brazilian anthologies of Darie Novăceanu. As he put it, \"I believe it a duty of the exile writer to defend the Romanian language from the 'party-minded' invasion of the mediocrities, the boot-lickers, the savvy ones and the profiteers, be they talented or talentless.\"\n\nBaciu's inclusion in a poetry anthology, put out in Bucharest by Nicolae Manolescu, scandalized the communist apparatus; the work was soon withdrawn from bookstores by the censors. Nevertheless, the new communist regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu made some efforts to appease Baciu and enlist him to write \"propaganda for Romanian art and culture during the years of socialist consolidation\", and even allowed Romanian journalists to contact him on the phone. Baciu claimed to have cut short such attempts, identifying them as a Securitate diversion. His rejection did not prevent Iron Guard loyalists such as Horia Stamatu from labeling Baciu a spy and avoiding all contact with him.\n\nIn 1974, Baciu ultimately put out at SUNY Press an overall anthology of Latin American poetry (\"Antología de la poesía latinoamericana\"), and at Editorial Joaquín Mortiz, in Mexico City, a critical anthology of Latin American surrealism, \"Antología de la poesía surrealista latinoamericana\". The latter book was enthusiastically reviewed in \"Plural\" magazine by the writer Octavio Paz, who noted that it was \"indispensable\" to the study of local surrealism and that it marked the \"end of gossip\" about the phenomenon. It is seen by literary historians as \"orthodox\" in comparison with Pellegrini's earlier chrestomathy. In 1975, he edited in Madrid posthumous reissue of Cugler's \"Vi-l prezint pe Țeavă\". The following year, at San José, Baciu put out a volume of his own essays on Costa Rica.\n\nMeanwhile, Mira Baciu, who discovered her artistic talents and became \"Mele\" illustrator, had completed her specialization at the University of Strasbourg under Jacques Borel, she lectured in Spanish language, then became a professor of French. She befriended artist Jacques Hérold, who illustrated her poetry volume of 1973, \"Houla, Macumba, Hora\". She died of cancer, on July 2, 1978, bequeathing her estate to fund a Romanian literature scholarship at the University of Hawaii.\n\nMira's death left Baciu in near-complete isolation from the Romanian-speaking public. As he later noted: \"I literally have no one to whom I would read the things I write. There are at most ten Romanian speakers living in Honolulu and none of them, absolutely none, has ever been to a bookstore or a library to peek into, or to ask for, or to purchase a single book of poetry.\" He honored her memory with a 1979 semi-autobiographical novel, eponymously titled \"Mira\". A new volume of his memoirs saw print in Honolulu in 1980, as \"Praful de pe tobă\" (\"The Dust on the Drum\"). It was taped by Virgil Ierunca and serialized by Radio Free Europe (RFE), which broadcast clandestinely into Romania.\n\nIn 1979, \"Antología de la poesía surrealista latinoamericana\" was reissued by the University of Valparaíso. Baciu also issued a new chrestomathy of Romanian-to-Spanish translations: \"11+11 poetas rumanos contemporáneos\", published by the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN). In addition to putting out \"Mele\" and his own works therein, Baciu published the Spanish-language collection of his poetry, \"El que pierde gana\" (\"He Who Loses Wins\", UNAN, 1978) and \"Pasaporte y pãnuelo\" (\"Passport and Handkerchief\", Revista Conservadora del Pensamiento Centroamericano, 1982). He returned to Portuguese-language writing in 1982, with \"Carioca honorário\" (\"An Honorary Carioca\"), which came out in 1982 at Pernambuco's Edições Pirata, and \"Lavradio 98\", a memoir of his work under Lacerda, at Editora Nova Fronteira of Rio. These were followed in 1984 by \"Un rumano en el Istmo\" (\"A Romanian in the Isthmus\"), at Universidad Veracruzana; and in 1985 by translations from Lucian Blaga (co-written with Eugenio Montejo), at Fundarte of Caracas, and a Heredia University biography of Francisco Amighetti. Among Baciu's later contributions include several essays such as \"Centroamericanos \" (San José, 1986) and a biography of Tristán Marof (La Paz, 1987).\n\nThroughout the late 1970s and early '80s, despite Baciu's isolation, \"Mele\" managed to obtain collaborations from many other Romanian writers, acquiring a relevant role in Romanian literary history. It hosted selections from the poetry of George Ciorănescu, who was at the time a chronicler for RFE. Ciorănescu returned the favor by popularizing Baciu's work in one of his broadcasts. \"Mele\" was especially noted for its reissue of works by the 1940s Romanian avant-garde. Baciu repeatedly tried to persuade Sesto Pals, who had returned to his regular job as an engineer, to publish a selection of his lifetime works. The May 1985 issue of \"Mele\" was entirely dedicated to Pals' poetry. Baciu also tracked down and interviewed poet-draftsman Paul Păun, who, like Pals, moved from Romania to Israel.\n\nBaciu maintained a close relationship with dissidents and avant-garde writers in his native Romania—over 100 people, according to concerned Securitate operatives. Such figures include Nicolae Carandino, Alexandru Paleologu, Radu Tudoran, Corneliu Coposu, Ion Dezideriu Sîrbu, Constantin Noica, Dan Culcer and Daniela Crăsnaru. He also corresponded with Constantin Mateescu, who provided him with references for the history of Mira's native city, Râmnicu Vâlcea. As Mateescu recalls, Vâlcea was still Baciu's \"charming land\". Baciu wrote a complete list of his own works, addressing it to literary critic Nicolae Steinhardt; like his other letters home, it was intercepted by the Securitate.\n\nAs remarked by Mateescu, in 1984 the correspondence was abruptly interrupted, \"even though [Baciu], well informed about our country's realities, was prudent and restrained in his statements\". Baciu's file shows that the Securitate also made note of this prudence, and was undecided about how to interpret it:Albeit he misses his country, [Baciu] does not wish to return for a visit, his refusal backed up by confused explanations, by 'poetic' statements according to which 'he carries his country inside him'. Although [Baciu] is adamant about his refusal of our country's current socio-political system, one may conclude that his literary activity, his propagation of Romanian literature, art and traditions, is positive in nature. The secret police repeatedly tried but failed to recruit Baciu's Romanian relatives as informants, and resorted to harassing them at their workplaces.\n\nWith some of his late works of autofiction, Baciu saluted the anticommunist revolt in his native Brașov. He was enthusiastic about the success of Romania's 1989 Revolution. According to his diaspora friend Constantin Eretescu, he hoped to see a rapid transition to a Western-style democracy, but was soon disappointed by the National Salvation Front regime. Interviewed by Marta Petreu for \"Apostrof\", he noted that \"one has a hard time adjusting after forty-six years in exile\". His contribution was honored abroad: retired from Hawaii University as a \"professor emeritus\", he was also Bolivia's honorary consul in Honolulu. In 1991, he became Commander of the Bolivian Order of Merit.\n\nBaciu died in Honolulu on January 6, 1993, allegedly while talking to his sister Ioana over the phone. His corpus of works, beginning with \"Poemele poetului tânăr\", was being republished in Romania, following efforts by his sister and his brother-in-law, Ovidiu Mărgineanu. A new edition of \"Praful de pe tobă\" saw print at Editura Eminescu in 1995. \"Mira\" was also republished, by Editura Albatros, in 1998. In 2006, when his \"Cetatea lui Bucur\" was reissued to critical acclaim, the \"Yellow House\" in Brașov was opened for the public as a Ștefan Baciu Memorial House, presently maintained by Brașov City Hall.\n\nCritic Vladimir Streinu saw Ștefan Baciu's early poetry as \"boastful\", but lacking \"a timber of its own\", and ultimately \"neutral\". His first surrealist episode was with \"Start\", ridiculed at the time by the mainstream review \"Viața Românească\" for its \"jolly good\" metaphors: \"It tells us that hounds feed on warm meat and that legs will sing when they walk.\" In \"Poeme de dragoste\", Streinu suggests, \"the tone is youthful\", but the subject matter is excessively lyrical and self-absorbed.\n\nThe poet soon moved into a more traditionalist format, with echoes from Ion Pillat and Parnassianism. The result is visualized by critic Daniel Cristea-Enache as a \"lace of impressionism\" with a \"thin but strong\" expressionistic thread. According to \"România Literară\" reviewer Cosmin Ciotloș, this is an \"exact and painstaking\", but also \"stunning\", species of poetry. In \"Cetatea lui Bucur\", Baciu outlined his vision of a decadent-but-fascinating Bucharest, with its many paradoxes: \"How much I hate thee, my beloved city\"; \"Your bitter joy has done me in\". As noted by Ciotloș, in Baciu's Bucharest \"everything is alive, everything is artificial\". The poetic cycle shows Baciu as a social critic, repulsed by the luxurious churches surrounded by slums, but also fascinated with the morbid aspects of Bucharest society, from the \"grave-blackened women\" of Bellu cemetery to the pleasure-seekers on Calea Victoriei—as noted by Cristea-Enache, the latter is merely an anti-capitalist \"cliché of that era\".\n\nPolitical inspiration also fueled some of Baciu's other juvenile works, including poems attacking the Nazis and honoring the August 23 Coup—written with a Social Democratic bias but owing ultimate inspiration to Vladimir Mayakovsky, the Soviet poet laureate. His more conventional humorous poetry, which came out around 1945, owed inspiration to the jocular verse of Păstorel Teodoreanu and George Topîrceanu.\n\nReturning to the avant-garde with \"Muzica sferelor\", with its homages to unconventional heroes such as Urmuz and George Ciprian, Baciu crafted his own poetic style. In large part, such lyrical work is explicitly self-referential, and inevitably linked to his diaspora experience. His nostalgia for Râmnicu Vâlcea and Brașov slowly replaced his memory of Bucharest. As noted by philologist Andrei Bodiu, he was not Brașov's first poetic chronicler, but the only such poet to be \"urban and cosmopolitan\" rather than elegiac and traditionalist. Baciu wrote poems dedicated in part to each Latin American country he visited, and made unexpected connections between them and his native country. One such piece, honoring the Cuban dissident movement, reads:\nBaciu's other poems include a set of pastiches and parody pieces, from Emil Botta, Lucian Blaga, Ion Barbu and Ion Vinea. They stand alongside satirical pieces targeting poets who had made compromises with the political system. In one such work, Baciu scolds Tudor Arghezi: \n\n"}
