His father was Punditt Kewal Ram Thakur and mother was Nanhee Devi. His birth name was Chaturbhuj.\n\nChaturbhuj finished his primary education in a school in Sikandrabad. Then he got admitted to Sanskrit College, Jaipur, Rajasthan. From here he received the degrees of Ayurvedacharya in Ayurveda and Shastri in Sanskrit in the year 1915. He also received the degree of Ayurvedacharya from Ayurveda Vidyapeetha.\n\nAfter finishing his education he came to Delhi to start his practice as an ayurvedic physician. He opened his own ayurvedic dispensary in Delhi but it did not run well and he had to close it down. He joined a rich man's charitable dispensary at the salary of Rupees 25 per month. Later in 1917, he joined DAV college, Lahore (now in Pakistan) as senior professor of Ayurveda. The management at the DAV college, Lahore was insulting to him, therefore, he resigned and went to Ajmer to help his father-in-law in his dispensary. Working at this dispensary, he started to write and soon became famous as a story writer and novelist.\n\nHis first novel Hridaya-Ki-Parakh (Trial of the Heart) was published in 1918. It did not bring him any recognition. His second book, Satyagraha Aur Asahyoga (Civil Resistance and Non-cooperation) was published in 1921. Contrary to the title, this book collided with the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi who was a prominent political figure in India in those days. This brought immense attention to Acharya Chatursen Shastri. These were followed by many historical novels, stories and ayurvedic books.\n\nAcharya Chatursen Shastri took his last breath on 2 February 1960.\n\nHis books present an idealistic view of Ancient period as can be seen clearly in his famous book Purnahuti. In this book he gives a eulogical account of Prithiviraj Chauhan's life and the battles fought. They are not historical but give details of life in ancient India. These books can be seen as a logical binding of history and philosophy and are worth recommending to anyone who is looking to know more about India before the advent of Islam. In his foreword to his book,'Vaishali ki Nagarvadhu', he declares this is his first book and the ones prior to this one were worthless; the book lives up to this declaration. It is hard to imagine a more readable description of society and politics in India around sixth century BC.\n\nHe was a friend of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, but he opposed Nehru's proposition of secular India. Nehru tried to ban his books after Congress came to power and accused Acharya Chatursen of fuelling tensions between Hindus and Muslims.\nHe was also a nationalist.\n\nThe bulk of his literary output is almost unparalleled in Hindi. In all, he wrote 72 published books including 8 historical novels, 10 dramas, 4 historical non-fictions, 15 collections of essays on political subjects and an equal number on the subjects of health and medicine. He also published over 250 short stories in various Hindi periodicals over time. His novel Dharamputra was adapted into Hindi film, \"Dharmputra\" (1961) by Yash Chopra, it won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi.\n\nHis important works include:\n\n\n"}

After being baptized in the Zaragozan Parish of San Felipe, she lived from three years of age in the Real Monastery of Santa Maria de la villa in Casbas, from which she was unable to leave and where she developed a deep religious and humanistic background.\n\nWithin the enclosures of the monastery Bolea was enriched with many different readings to the point where she was able to learn classical Latin. She was professed as religious on 4 June 1624. In 1655 she was mistress of novices and came to hold the office of abbess in 1672. She corresponded with leading scholars and writers within the Aragonese literary circles, she particularly enjoyed the patronage of Vincencio Juan de Lastanosa, as well as the Count of Salinas, Juan Francisco Andrés de Uztarroz and most likely, with Gracián, who praised her and collected her poems in his \"Agudeza y arte de ingenio\".\n\nAna Francisca Abarca de Bolea's poetry is found within a miscellaneous book titled \"Vigilia y Octaverio de San Juan Bautista\" (Zaragoza, 1679), which also combines a short novel, or apologue (\"La ventura en la desdicha\"), and a novel (\"El fin bueno en mal principio\"). It deals with the miscellaneous genre—very well known at the time—where in the framework of a dialogue inherited from humanism, literature of various genres are interspersed. In this case, the framework resembles that of a pastoral novel, perhaps the last Spanish pastoral novel of the time, in which a group of rich and refined pastors meet in an area of Moncayo, where a hermitage dedicated to San Juan stands to celebrate the vigil and Octave of the feast of the Saint. Over a period of nine days, they amuse themselves with various entertainments and banquets, engaging in debates, the telling of anecdotes, and reciting romances and songs.\n\nThe themes of her poetry in large part possess a sacred and popular character. In some of them she uses the Aragonese language—in fact, her works are some of the few examples of literature with linguistic features of seventeenth-century Aragonese. An example is the \"birth Albada\" which is composed of twenty Christmas-themed romantic couplets and reveals folklore customs (sung by Ginés and Pascual to the custom of their village and sound of the bagpipes). The author's commentary--\"the lyrics gave remarkable pleasure and they admired the ingenuity, and may that ancient tongue that was used in Spain be conserved\"—indicates that the use of the Aragonese language was not conscious. These poems were studied by Philologists Manuel Alvar, Francho Nagore, M.ª Ángeles Campo, or José Manuel Blecua. Here is an example of her \"Albada de nacimiento\" (\"birth Albada\"):\n\nMedia noche era por filos\n\nlas doce daba el reloch\n\ncuando ha nagido en Belén\n\nun mozardet como un sol.\n\n"}

He not only revised Volapük, but also (together with other Volapükist contemporaries) began Volapükaklub Valemik Nedänik (Dutch Universal Volapük Club) and founded Diläd valemik Feda Volapükaklubas. He also founded and edited \"Volapükagased pro Nedänapükans\", an independent newspaper in Volapük, which ran for thirty-one years (1932–1963). He wrote Gramat Volapüka, a grammar of the language completely in Volapük, and a German-Volapük dictionary, \"Wörterbuch der Weltsprache\" (\"World Language Dictionary\"). He translated the New Testament into Volapük from Greek, as well as many other pieces of literature. Arie de Jong is justly considered the most important Volapükist of a new age of Volapük history.\n\nArie de Jong was born on October 18, 1865 to happy parents in Batavia (now Jakarta) in then Dutch East Indies. In 1873, his family moved to Leiden, Netherlands, where he attended grammar-school (1873-1883) and studied medicine (1883-1891) at Leiden University. In February 1891, he received his Doctorate diploma; in March, he became a military medical officer (stationed in East India); briefly afterward, on September 8, he became a university medical doctor in Freiburg by means of his dissertation: \"Über Diuretin\" (On Diuresis).\n\nOn February 18, 1892, de Jong married Maria Elisabeth Wilhelmina Clarkson in Ginneken, and the couple left by a ship by the name of \"Princess Sophie\" after only one month, on March 22, towards Dutch East Indies. Maria, however, died aboard ship on the Red Sea, on the first day of April. Nineteen days later, Arie reached the city of Batavia alone, and on the 25th, he decided to depart to his workshop in Makassar.\n\nIn 1893, he was relocated to Bonthain (now Bantaeng in South Sulawesi); in 1896, to Padang and also to Aceh; in 1898, to Sintang, where he married for the second time, to Elise Marie Wilhelmine Gerardine Chavannes. In 1900, he became a first-class medical officer; in 1902, below he was relocated, first to Semarang and later to Ungaran; in 1904 he returned to Semarang. By that time he had already lost his two children: Marie Eugène, who was born in 1900 and died the following year, and another child who was stillborn.\n\nIn 1904 he enjoyed leisure for a year, during which he spent time in Europe. Having returned in 1905 to East Indies, he was sent to Pelantoengan, in 1908 to Yogyakarta, and in 1911 to Magelang, where for in eight years he would become a second-class medical officer. In 1912 he was relocated to Banjarmasin; the following year, he had leisure in Europe for nine months. When he returned to East Indies, he was sent to Surabaya where, at the end of 1914 he became a higher-ranked first-class medical officer. He was sent in 1915 to Malano, where his second wife, Elise Marie, died.\n\nAt that time Dutch East Indies still much needed to be organized and improved. Arie de Jong had an important role for these years in the struggle against many tropical diseases, considering that new treatments and previously denied methods appeared at the turn of the century. He helped lepers by providing certain contents for their lives, he allowed them to play instruments and made it possible for them to do simple jobs; and at this time, when these types of actions were not yet popular.\n\nAfter the death of his wife in 1919, Arie de Jong returned to the Netherlands. In the following year he made The Hague his home, at the age of 54. In 1921, he married his third wife, Louise van Dissel. They had three children: Louisa Cornelia (born in 1922), Arie de Jong, Jr. (1924), and Gijsbertus Hendrienus (1926).\n\nDuring his studies in Leiden, de Jong came across Volapük and began to learn it. On March 20, 1891 (a week after he became a military officer), at the age of 25, he received his Volapük teacher's diploma, and after ten months, his Volapük instructor diploma. After only a year, on May 15, 1893, he became a Volapük professor (reported in the newspaper \"Nuns blefik se Volapükavol\" (\"Brief News in the World of Volapük\") the following year).\n\nDuring his stay in the East Indies, de Jong's interest in Volapük remained, as seen in his correspondence with various Volapükists and Volapük newspapers. On June 5, 1901, he became a Volapük academian.\n\n"}

It includes 30 consonants, seven vowels, and five tones that are indicated by dots and lines inside of each vowel.\n\nIn the 1970s the United Bible Societies (UBS) published a translation of the New Testament. June Hobley, of Liberia Inland Mission, was primarily responsible for the translation. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) was used for this translation rather than the Vah script, mostly for practical reasons related to printing. Because the Bassa people had a tradition of writing, they quickly adapted to the new script, and thousands learned to read.\n\nIn 2005, UBS published the entire Bible in Bassa. The translation was sponsored by the Christian Education Foundation of Liberia, Christian Reformed World Missions, and UBS. Don Slager headed a team of translators that included Seokin Payne, Robert Glaybo, and William Boen.\n\nThe IPA has largely replaced the Vah script in publications. However, the Vah script is still highly respected and is still in use by some older men, primarily for record keeping.\n\n"}
{"id": "18369947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18369947", "title": "Bible translations into Amharic", "text": "Bible translations into Amharic\n\nAlthough Christianity became the state religion of Ethiopia in the 4th century, and the Bible was first translated into Ge'ez at about that time, only in the last two centuries have there appeared translations of the Bible into Amharic.\n\nThe first translation of the Bible into Amharic was by Abu Rumi in the early 19th century. In the opinion of Edward Ullendorff, \"The history of the first translation of the Bible into Amharic is a romantic and exciting story which deserves to be better known among \"éthiopisants\". The French Consul in Cairo, a language scholar named Jean-Louis Asselin de Cherville, possessed a manuscript containing a complete translation of the Bible into Amharic, created by the mutual efforts of the Consul and Abu Rumi. As Ullendorff relates, for ten years \"every Tuesday and Saturday his de Cherville's door was shut to all visitors when he read with 'my Abyssinian, slowly and with the utmost attention, every verse of the Sacred Volume, in the Arabic Version which we were able to translate.' But we are not told from which Arabic version the rendering was made.\" Where the Arabic words were \"abstruse, difficult, or foreign\", de Cherville then consulted \"the Hebrew Original, the Syriac Version, or the Septuagint\" for clarification.\n\nWilliam Jowett purchased de Cherville's manuscript, consisting of 9,539 pages written in \"the fine hand\" of Abu Rumi for £1,250, which he then presented for review to Professor Samuel Lee, and the final manuscript was printed by Thomas Pell Platt in increasing portions: the four Gospels in 1824, the entire New Testament in 1829, and the complete Bible in 1840. This translation, \"with some changes and amendments, held sway until the Emperor Haile Selassie I ordered a new translation\", which was published in 1960/61.\n\nA new translation was underway, under the Emperor Haile Selassie I's patronage, when the Italian army invaded. This manuscript was later sent to Britain and printed, but most of the copies were destroyed in a fire during the bombing of London. This translation is sometimes known as the \"Buxton\" translation, because a British missionary named Alfred Buxton (1891–1940) was instrumental in sending the manuscript from occupied Ethiopia to Britain. This same basic translation, with some changes, was later printed in the USA, with funds raised by Rev. Donald Barnhouse. After it was printed, this translation (sometimes referred to as the \"Barnhouse New Testament\") was found to contain a serious error in Rev. 19:10 & 22:9 (an angel commanding John to worship him, rather than prohibiting John to worship him), so most copies were destroyed.\n\nIn 1962, a new Amharic translation from Ge'ez was printed, again with the patronage of the Emperor. The preface by Emperor Haile Selassie I is dated \"1955\" (E.C.), and the 31st year of his reign (i.e. AD 1962 in the Gregorian Calendar), and states that it was translated by the Bible Committee he convened between AD 1947 and 1952, \"realizing that there ought to be a revision from the original Hebrew and Greek of the existing translation of the Bible\". It included the 66 books of the protocanon (i.e. those held canonical in common with Protestant and Catholic Christians), as the 5 narrow canon deuterocanonical books were published separately. The five narrow canon Ethiopian deuterocanonical books comprise 1 Enoch (\"Henok\"; different from the standard editions of Ge'ez manuscripts A~Q by foreign academics), Jubilees (Ge'ez: \"Mets'hafe Kufale\") and I, II, and III Meqabyan (substantially different from I, II, and III Maccabees) \n\nThe 81 book Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Bible, including the deuterocanonicals, 46 books of the Old Testament and 35 books of the New Testament, was published in 1986. This version incorporates a few minor changes or corrections to the 1962 Amharic text of the New Testament, but the text of the Old Testament and Deuterocanon are identical to those previously published under Haile Selassie I.\n\nUnder the Bible Society of Ethiopia (a member of the United Bible Societies), a new translation was printed in 1987, translated directly from Hebrew and Greek. A revised version of this appeared in 2005. These versions contain only the 66 books of the Protestant canon, and they have not been widely embraced by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\n\nLiving Bibles International produced a New Testament in 1985. Following the 1992 merger of LBI with IBS, the International Bible Society produced a complete Bible in 2001. This is a translation from the English NIV, or is at least very heavily reliant upon it.\n\nIn 2008, the Watch Tower Society produced an Amharic translation of Jehovah's Witnesses \"New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures\".\n\nFor the millennium celebration on the Ethiopian calendar, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Bible Society produced a new translation. This translation differed from recent Amharic translations in that the translators generally followed the Greek Septuagint (LXX) translation for the Old Testament and the Ge'ez for both the Old and the New. It was warmly welcomed by the Orthodox, but not by Protestants, both sides misunderstanding some points of history and the Biblical canon.\n\n\n"}

The team uses .50 caliber machine guns, mk-19 automatic 40mm grenade launcher, and a tube-launched optically tracked wire guided missile system (TOW missiles).\n\nMembers of the CAAT Team require aptitude battery and specific training beyond basic infantry and also cross level training on the global inventory of mobile weapon systems.\n\nIn addition to providing security for convoys, Diplomatic buildings, airfields in urban and rural environment, CAAT Teams are a vehicle-mounted form of quick reaction employment for heavy weapons in an infantry unit.\n\nA CAAT platoon is composed of machine gunners and anti-tank missilemen. They team up to provide the combined arms power of the M2 Browning .50 caliber heavy machine gun, Mk 19 40MM automatic grenade launcher, M-240B medium machine gun, and the TOW missile system either from vehicles or from a ground position.\n\nIn its most basic role, a CAAT platoon and its various sections and teams will engage armored vehicles (tanks, APCs, etc.) first with heavy machine guns, usually the M2 .50 caliber machine gun. This is to \"button up\" the vehicle, or have the vehicle operators close all the hatches in order to protect themselves from the incoming rounds. When the target is effectively buttoned up, the TOW missile operator will fire a TOW missile, which, upon impact, will cause a dramatic increase in pressure in the closed target vehicle (such as a tank), causing it to explode from the overpressure, eliminating the enemy.\n\nDue to their vehicle-borne nature, CAAT platoon will provide scouting capabilities during movements. They will traditionally take the lead for a movement of vehicles for security reasons, and therefore also taking responsibility for navigation and orientation. In addition, CAAT vehicles will be the last vehicles in the convoy (the rear, or \"tail end charlie\") for protection and get visual identitification on any oncoming vehicles from behind. If necessary, other CAAT vehicles can scout parallel routes or forward positions as necessary.\n\nA CAAT platoon will be divided into 2 or 3 sections, and each section will have an odd number of teams. Each section will be headed by a staff NCO, and the remaining pairs of vehicles will have NCOs in charge (personnel permitting). The billets (or jobs) in a vehicle can include:\n\n\nThe CAAT teams will usually be paired up as one heavy machine gun and one TOW truck. This allows the combined arms effect that is most effective on an armored vehicle. Usually the section heads (the odd vehicle of the paired teams) have an Mk 19, while the other teams have a .50 cal, M-240G, or a TOW missile. In addition, the section heads usually travel with a team (making three vehicles), so as to not be left alone.\n\n\n"}

The party's main platform is the introduction of Esperanto as the official language of the EU in order to make international communication more efficient and fair in economical and philosophical terms, based on the conclusions of a report by François Grin.\n\nAs Europe–Démocratie–Espéranto, the party first took part in an election in the European Parliament election, 2004, in France. Its German branch, Europa–Demokratie–Esperanto, failed to gather the 4000 signatures necessary to participate in the elections in Germany.\n\nThe list's main goal is the promotion of Esperanto in the EU. In the medium term, it wants Esperanto taught in schools Europe-wide, and in the long term, it wants the EU to adopt Esperanto as its official language. In order to make this goal a reality, the EDE is striving to have list candidates in each country in the EU for the European Parliament election, 2009. Until now the organisation has only had branch offices in France and Germany.\n\nWhile most Esperanto institutions such as Universala Esperanto-Asocio are by statute and in practice politically neutral, some discussion about the neutrality of EDE has arisen. Specifically, there is concern over what other policies might through EDE be linked with Esperanto other than the advancement of Esperanto itself. German Esperanto writer Ulrich Matthias argues that in gaining broad support in Germany at least, EDE would be best served to identify with centrist positions advancing humanism, peace and environmentalism, as well as opposing \"U.S. hegemony\" and linguistic imperialism in the correct fashion.\n\nBecause Esperanto is considered by many Esperanto speakers to be a worldwide movement, some fear that advancing the cause of Esperanto within the EU could cast the language as a European issue and hamper the progress of the language outside of Europe.\n\nThe party did not set out to have a referendum on languages — instead, the EDE tries to set up Esperanto as an alternative to the twenty different official languages of the European Union, which leads enormous expenses. \n\nThe 2004 parliamentary election broke records for the number of parties participating, and the EDE became something of a poster child for protest parties, being picked out by national papers as an example of the ridiculous.

In the context of concrete construction, the falsework supports the shuttering molds.\n\nFormwork comes in several types: \n\nSome of the earliest examples of concrete slabs were built by Roman engineers. Because concrete is quite strong in resisting compressive loads, but has relatively poor tensile or torsional strength, these early structures consisted of arches, vaults and domes. The most notable concrete structure from this period is the Pantheon in Rome. To mould this structure, temporary scaffolding and formwork or falsework was built in the future shape of the structure. These building techniques were not isolated to pouring concrete, but were and are widely used in masonry. Because of the complexity and the limited production capacity of the building material, concrete’s rise as a favored building material did not occur until the invention of Portland cement (and developments by the Edison Portland Cement Company) and reinforced concrete.\n\nSimilar to the traditional method, but stringers and joist are replaced with engineered wood beams and supports are replaced with adjustable metal props. This makes this method more systematic and reusable.\n\nOn the dawn of the rival of concrete in slab structures, building techniques for the temporary structures were derived again from masonry and carpentry. The traditional slab formwork technique consists of supports out of lumber or young tree trunks, that support rows of stringers assembled roughly 3 to 6 feet or 1 to 2 metres apart, depending on thickness of slab. Between these stringers, joists are positioned roughly 12 inches, 30 centimeters apart upon which boards or plywood are placed. The stringers and joists are usually 4 by 4 inch or 4 by 6 inch lumber. The most common imperial plywood thickness is ¾ inch and the most common metric thickness is 18 mm.\n\nSimilar to the traditional method, but stringers and joist are replaced with aluminium forming systems or steel beams and supports are replaced with metal props. This also makes this method more systematic and reusable. Aluminum beams are fabricated as telescoping units which allows them to span supports that are located at varying distances apart. Telescoping aluminium beams can be used and reused in the construction of structures of varying size.\n\nThese systems consist of prefabricated timber, steel or aluminum beams and formwork modules. Modules are often no larger than 3 to 6 feet or 1 to 2 metres in size. The beams and formwork are typically set by hand and pinned, clipped, or screwed together. The advantages of a modular system are: does not require a crane to place the formwork, speed of construction with unskilled labor, formwork modules can be removed after concrete sets leaving only beams in place prior to achieving design strength.\n\nThese systems consist of slab formwork \"tables\" that are reused on multiple stories of a building without being dismantled. The assembled sections are either lifted per elevator or \"flown\" by crane from one story to the next. Once in position the gaps between the tables or table and wall are filled with \"fillers\". They vary in shape and size as well as their building material. The use of these systems can greatly reduce the time and manual labor involved in setting and striking the formwork. Their advantages are best utilized by large area and simple structures. It is also common for architects and engineers to design building around one of these systems.\nA table is built pretty much the same way as a beam formwork but the single parts of this system are connected together in a way that makes them transportable. The most common sheathing is plywood, but steel and fiberglass are also in use. The joists are either made from timber, wood I-beams, aluminium or steel. The stringers are sometimes made of wood I-beams but usually from steel channels. These are fastened together (screwed, weld or bolted) to become a \"deck\". These decks are usually rectangular but can also be other shapes.\n\nAll support systems have to be height adjustable to allow the formwork to be placed at the correct height and to be removed after the concrete is cured. Normally adjustable metal props similar to (or the same as) those used by beam slab formwork are used to support these systems. Some systems combine stringers and supports into steel or aluminum trusses. Yet other systems use metal frame shoring towers, which the decks are attached to. Another common method is to attach the formwork decks to previously cast walls or columns,thus eradicating the use of vertical props altogether. In this method, adjustable support shoes are bolted through holes (sometimes tie holes) or attached to cast anchors.\n\nThe size of these tables can vary from . There are two general approaches in this system:\n\nThis technique is fairly common in the United States and east Asian countries. The advantages of this approach are the further reduction of manual labour time and cost per unit area of slab and a simple and systematic building technique. The disadvantages of this approach are the necessary high lifting capacity of building site cranes, additional expensive crane time, higher material costs and little flexibility.\n\nBy this approach the tables are limited in size and weight. Typical widths are between , typical lengths are between , though table sizes may vary in size and form. The major distinction of this approach is that the tables are lifted either with a crane transport fork or by material platform elevators attached to the side of the building. They are usually transported horizontally to the elevator or crane lifting platform singlehandedly with shifting trolleys depending on their size and construction. Final positioning adjustments can be made by trolley. This technique enjoys popularity in the US, Europe and generally in high labor cost countries. The advantages of this approach in comparison to beam formwork or modular formwork is a further reduction of labor time and cost. Smaller tables are generally easier to customize around geometrically complicated buildings, (round or non rectangular) or to form around columns in comparison to their large counterparts. The disadvantages of this approach are the higher material costs and increased crane time (if lifted with crane fork).\n\nTunnel forms are large, room size forms that allows walls and floors to be cast in a single pour. With multiple forms, the entire floor of a building can be done in a single pour. Tunnel forms require sufficient space exterior to the building for the entire form to be slipped out and hoisted up to the next level. A section of the walls is left uncasted to remove the forms. Typically castings are done with a frequency of 4 days. Tunnel forms are most suited for buildings that have the same or similar cells to allow re-use of the forms within the floor and from one floor to the next, in regions which have high labor prices.\n\nSee structural coffer.\n\n\nThere is an increasing focus on sustainability in design, backed up by carbon dioxide emissions reduction targets. The low embodied energy of concrete by volume is offset by its rate of consumption which make the manufacture of cement accountable for some 5% of global CO2 emissions.\n\nConcrete is a fluid that offers the opportunity to economically create structures of almost any geometry - we can pour concrete into a mould of almost any shape. This fluidity is seldom utilise, with concrete instead being poured into rigid moulds to create high material use structures with large carbon footprints. The ubiquitous use of orthogonal moulds as concrete formwork has resulted in a well-established vocabulary of prismatic forms for concrete structures, yet such rigid formwork systems must resist considerable pressures and consume significant amounts of material. Moreover, the resulting member requires more material and has a greater self-weight than one cast with a variable cross section.\n\nSimple optimisation methods may be used to design a variable cross section member in which the flexural and shear capacity at any point along the element length reflects the requirements of the loading envelope applied to it.\n\nBy replacing conventional moulds with a flexible system composed primarily of low cost fabric sheets, flexible formwork takes advantage of the fluidity of concrete to create highly optimised, architecturally interesting, building forms. Significant material savings can be achieved. The optimised section provides ultimate limit state capacity while reducing embodied carbon, thus improving the life cycle performance of the entire structure.\n\nControl of the flexibly formed beam cross section is key to achieving low-material use design. The basic assumption is that a sheet of flexible, permeable fabric is held in a system of falsework before reinforcement and concrete are added. By varying the geometry of the fabric mould with distance along the beam, the optimised shape is created. Flexible formwork therefore has the potential to facilitate the change in design and construction philosophy that will be required for a move towards a less material intensive, more sustainable, construction industry. Its potential is further demonstrated in work by Lee.\n\nFabric formwork is a small niche in concrete technology. It uses soft, flexible materials against the fresh concrete as formwork, normally with some sort of strong tension textile or plastic material. The International Society of Fabric Forming conducts research on fabric formwork.\n\nDue to its ease of use, cassette laying formwork creates a supreme output. Since there is no need for a crane, the materials needed are just assemblies of parts that people can carry which means there is lower amounts of personnel, labor hours, and quick turnaround times.\n\nFor removable forms, once the concrete has been poured into formwork and has set (or \"cured\"), the formwork is \"struck\" or \"stripped\" (removed) to expose the finished concrete. The time between pouring and formwork stripping depends on the job specifications, the cure required, and whether the form is supporting any weight, but is usually at least 24 hours after the pour is completed. For example, the California Department of Transportation requires the forms to be in place for 1–7 days after pouring, while the Washington State Department of Transportation requires the forms to stay in place for 3 days with a damp blanket on the outside.\nSpectacular accidents have occurred when the forms were either removed too soon or had been under-designed to carry the load imposed by the weight of the uncured concrete. Less critical and much more common (though no less embarrassing and often costly) are those cases in which under-designed formwork bends or breaks during the filling process (especially if filled with a high-pressure concrete pump). This then results in fresh concrete escaping out of the formwork in a \"form blowout\", often in large quantities.\n\nConcrete exerts less pressure against the forms as it hardens, so forms are usually designed to withstand a number of feet per hour of pour rate to give the concrete at the bottom time to firm up. For example, wall or column forms are commonly designed for a pour rate between 4–8 ft/hr. The hardening is an asymptotic process, meaning that most of the final strength will be achieved after a short time, though some further hardening can occur depending on the cement type and admixtures.\n\nWet concrete also applies hydrostatic pressure to formwork. The pressure at the bottom of the form is therefore greater than at the top. In the illustration of the column formwork to the right, the 'column clamps' are closer together at the bottom. Note that the column is braced with steel adjustable 'formwork props' and uses 20 mm 'through bolts' to further support the long side of the column.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16920273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16920273", "title": "Homicidal ideation", "text": "Homicidal ideation\n\nHomicidal ideation is a common medical term for thoughts about homicide. There is a range of homicidal thoughts which spans from vague ideas of revenge to detailed and fully formulated plans without the act itself. Many people who have homicidal ideation do not commit homicide. 50-91% of people surveyed on university grounds in various places in the United States admit to having had a homicidal fantasy. Homicidal ideation is common, accounting for 10-17% of patient presentations to psychiatric facilities in the United States.\n\nHomicidal ideation is not a disease itself, but may result from other illnesses such as delirium and psychosis. Psychosis, which accounts for 89% of admissions with homicidal ideation in one US study, includes substance-induced psychosis (e.g. amphetamine psychosis) and the psychoses related to schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia. Delirium is often drug induced or secondary to general medical illness(es) (see F05).\n\nIt may arise in association with personality disorders or it may occur in people who do not have any detectable illness. In fact, surveys have shown that the majority of people have had homicidal fantasies at some stage in their life. Many theories have been proposed to explain this.\n\nHomicidal ideation is noted to be an important risk factor when trying to identify a person's risk for violence. This type of assessment is routine for psychiatric patients or any other patients presenting to hospital with mental health complaints. There are many associated risk factors which include: history of violence and any thoughts of committing harm, poor impulse control and an inability to delay gratification, impairment or loss of reality testing, especially with delusional beliefs or command hallucinations, the feeling of being controlled by an outside force, the belief that other people wish to harm him or her, the perception of rejection or humiliation at the hands of others, being under the influence of substances or a history of antisocial personality disorder, frontal lobe dysfunction or head injury.\n\nPeople who have homicidal ideation are at higher risk of other psychopathology than the normal population. This includes suicidal ideation, psychosis, delirium, or intoxication. It is well established that people with schizophrenia have an increased risk of committing violent acts, including homicide.\n\nHomicidal ideation may arise in relation to behavioural conditions such as personality disorder (particularly conduct disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder). A study in Finland showed an increased risk of violence from people who have antisocial personality disorder, which is greater than the risk of violence from people who have schizophrenia. The same study also cites that many other mental disorders are not associated with an increased risk of violence, of note: depression, anxiety disorders and intellectual disability.\n\nHomicidal ideation may arise in people who are otherwise quite well, as is demonstrated by the fact that the greater majority of people within the general population have had homicidal fantasies. When triggering factors are sought regarding homicidal fantasies the majority seem to be linked in some way to the disruption of a couple relationship. Either jealousy or revenge, greed/lust or even fear and self-defense prompt homicidal thoughts and actions in the majority of cases. In a minority of cases, homicides and acts of violence may be related to mental disorder. These homicides and fantasies do not seem to have the same underlying triggers as those by people without a mental disorder, but when these trigger factors are present the risk for violence is greater than usual.\n\nPeople who present with homicidal ideation also have a higher risk of suicide. This shows the need for an assessment of suicide risk in people with thoughts of violence towards others.\n\nSometimes people claiming to have homicidal ideation do not actually have homicidal thoughts but merely claim to have them. They may do this for a variety of reasons, e.g. to gain attention, to coerce a person or people for or against some action, or to avoid social or legal obligation (sometimes by gaining admission to a hospital) — see malingering or factitious disorder.\n\nA number of theories have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of homicidal ideation or homicide itself. Many of these theories seem to overlap. They often are not mutually exclusive. At present no single theory explains all the phenomena noted in homicide, although many theories go some way to explaining several areas. Most of these theories follow the reasoning of theories studied in criminology. A brief synopsis of theories specific to homicide follows.\n\nThis is the most recent of evolutionary theories. It claims to explain most of the phenomena associated with homicide. It states that humans have evolved with adaptations that enable us to think of and/or plan homicide. We come up with the idea as a possible answer to our problem position (threat to ourselves, our mate or our resources) and include a range of thought processes regarding killer and victim (degree of relatedness, relative status, gender, reproductive values, size and strength of families, allies and resources) and the potential costs of making use of such a high penalty strategy as homicide. If homicide is determined to be the best solution strategy, then it might be functional.\n\nAccording to this hypothesis, homicide is considered to be a mistake or over-reaction. Normal psychological mechanisms for control of property, partner or personal safety may not appear to be sufficient under certain stressful circumstances and abnormal mechanisms develop. Particularly extreme expressions of this may occur leading to homicide where in the normal state the perpetrator would not behave in this manner.\n\nNot much information is available regarding the management of patients with homicidal thoughts. In Western countries, the management of such people lies within the realms of the police force and the health system. It is generally agreed upon that people with homicidal thoughts who are thought to be at high risk of acting them out should be recognized as needing help. They should be brought swiftly to a place where an assessment can be made and any underlying medical or mental disorder should be treated.\n"}

Interactional sociolinguistics was founded by linguistic anthropologist John J. Gumperz. Topics of interest include cross-cultural miscommunication, politeness, and framing.\n\nIn terms of research methods, interactional sociolinguists analyze audio or video recordings of conversations or other interactions. Analysis focuses not only on linguistic forms such as words and sentences but also on subtle cues such as prosody and register that signal contextual presupposition. These contextualization cues are culturally specific and usually unconscious. When participants in a conversation come from different cultural backgrounds they may not recognize these subtle cues in one another's speech, leading to misunderstanding.\n\n"}
{"id": "5721139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5721139", "title": "Ishkashimi language", "text": "Ishkashimi language\n\nIshkashimi (Ishkashimi: \"škošmī zəvuk/rənīzəvuk\") is an Iranian language spoken in the Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan, Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region in Tajikistan, and Chitral region of Pakistan.\n\nThe total number of speakers is c. 2,500, most of whom are now dispersed throughout Tajikistan and Afghanistan and small villages within the vicinity. Based on this number, Ishkashimi is threatened to becoming critically endangered or extinct in the next 100 years whereas other significant languages are being spoken in schools, homes, etc. These languages are Tajik language in Tajikistan and Dari language in Afghanistan, and they contribute to the decline in the use of Ishkashimi, which at the moment has a status of endangered language. Besides, information about Ishkashimi language is limited due to the lack of extensive and systematic research and the lack of a written system.\n\nIshkashimi is closely related to Zebaki and Sanglechi dialects (in Afghanistan). It was grouped until recently with the Sanglechi dialect under the parent family Sanglechi-Ishkashimi (sgl), but a more comprehensive linguistic analysis showed significant differences between these speech varieties. Phonology and grammar of Ishkashimi language is similar to phonology and grammar of the closely related Zebaki dialect.\n\nIshkashimi language has approximately 2500 speakers, of which 1500 speakers are in the Ishkashim and Wakham districts and a variety of villages in the Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan, and 1000 speakers are in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region in Tajikistan, Ryn and Sumjin villages, and the Ishkoshim town, and some inhabit the Chitral region of Pakistan.\n\nIshkashimi is an Iranian language of the Indo-European family. Originally Ishkashimi was considered to belong to the Sanglechi-Ishkashimi family of Eastern Iranian languages. But recent research showed that such a combination was inappropriate for these dialects due to the significant linguistic differences between them. And on January 18, 2010 the parent language had retired and been split into what are now Sanglechi and Ishkashimi dialects. This subfamily has furthermore been considered a part of the Pamir languages group, together with the Wakhi language, and of the subgroup comprising Shughni, Rushani, Sarikoli, Yazgulyam, etc. However, this is an areal rather than genetic grouping.\n\nIshkashimi is a threatened language that does not have a status of official language in the regions of its use.\n\nThe Ishkashimi language vitality, despite the positive attitudes towards the language, is declining due to increasing use by native speakers of other languages like Dari in Afghanistan and Tajik in Tajikistan in a variety of domains, such as education, religious, private domain and others. For example, due to Dari being the language of the education system, almost all Ishkashimi speakers, and especially the younger ones, have high Dari proficiency. Education can get complicated with the use of two languages, therefore schools prefer to use Dari. Instructions are solely in Dari, but rarely will teachers speak Ishkashimi to students for explanations. Similar to schools, religion is widely practiced with Dari especially for preaching and prayers, and when it comes to mass media and the government, Dari is exclusively used. Meanwhile, in the private and community domains both Dari and Ishkashimi languages are used equally. In Tajikistan areas Ishkashimi is a first choice for communication between family members and in private conversations between friends and coworkers, however the use of Tajik and Wakhi languages in other domains leads to decline in Ishkashimi use. There is an understanding in the Ishkashimi speaking community that the language can face a possible extinction because of its limited use .\n\nThere is an Afghan and Tajik Ishkashimi varieties of Ishkashimi language, and they are considered to be mutually comprehensible, as some sociolinguistic questionnaires demonstrated.\n\nThere are seven vowel phonemes: a, e, i, o, u, u, and ə \nThere are thirty one consonant phonemes: \nIshkashimi, as one of the Pamir languages, does not contain velar fricative phonemes, which is possibly the result of being influenced by Persian and Indo-Aryan languages throughout the history of its development. Also the use of the consonant [h] in the language is optional.\n\nThere are many exceptions, but as a rule stress falls on the last syllable in a word with multiple syllables. Sometimes, as a result of the rhythm in the phrase, the stress will freely move to syllables other than the last syllable.\n\n\nThe word order in Ishkashimi is SOV (Subject–object–verb), however the order can be influenced by the varieties of the information structure in the sentences.\n\nA significant part of Ishkashimi vocabulary contains words and syntactic structures that were borrowed from other languages, the reason behind it is a regular and close contact of Ishkashimi speakers with other languages. For example, the history of the focus particle \"Faqat\" (Eng: \"only\") shows that it was borrowed from Persian language, which was earlier borrowed by Persian from Arabic.\n\nTaboo words were formed and added into Ishkashimi language as a result of use of ancient epithets and of derivation of the words from other languages, often followed by the change of their meaning and pronunciation. Some of the taboo Ishkashimi words, which are also similarly seen as taboo in other Pamir languages, are:\n\nIshkashimi is a non-written language that does not have a writing system or literature, and in the previous centuries the Persian language, which dominated the region, was used to write down some of the traditional folklore. There were, however, some efforts made at the end of the twentieth century to implement a writing system based on Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nThe first attempts by linguists to collect and organize data about the Ishkashimi language were made around the beginning of the 19th century, and were later continued by Russian and Ishkashimi linguists, like T. Pakhalina. Before any systematic description and documentation of Ishkashimi language, the researchers collected some random vocabulary examples and mentioned the language in the works about Iranian languages. Only in the end of the twentieth century linguists created a more comprehensive description of Ishkashimi language.\n\n\n"}

Goad co-authored and published the cult zine \"ANSWER Me!\" and \"The Redneck Manifesto\". Comedian Patton Oswalt cites Goad's writing as an influence. He resides in Stone Mountain, Georgia. .\n\nJim Goad was born June 12, 1961, in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. Growing up in Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, Goad described himself as a teenager who was a loner, misanthropic and a weirdo. He attended a Catholic school, and experienced violent treatment by the nuns and his father, eventually learning to fight back. As a teenager he wanted to move to New York City to study acting and was accepted to study at New York University under Stella Adler.\n\nGoad graduated in 1985 with a B.A. in Journalism from Temple University while living in New Jersey. In the early 1980s Goad met Debbie Rosalie at a Johnny Thunders concert in New York City. Debbie was eight years older than Goad, Jewish and lived in Coney Island. The couple lived in New York and Debbie worked at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Goad at a Lower East Side print shop. The couple left New York suddenly after Goad beat up their Brighton Beach landlord for calling Debbie \"stupid\". The landlord filed, and then dropped, assault charges, but the Goads would not return to New York, settling in Los Angeles. The couple married in Las Vegas in 1987. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Goad started working at the \"Los Angeles Reader\", covering local news, and freelancing for \"Playboy\" and \"Details\" magazine. Goad was unhappy with the content he was covering, and wishing to cover more fringe subjects the couple began publishing their own work.\n\nAround 1994 the couple moved to Portland, Oregon and Goad devoted his time to writing. Debbie would be diagnosed with ovarian cancer while Goad was dating \"ANSWER Me!\" groupie Anne \"Skye\" Ryan. Goad described Ryan as \"Sweet Dracula girl\" and as being \"...fifteen years younger than me and a thousand times more fucked-up.\"\n\nGoad and Ryan would have a physically abusive relationship, often beating one another up. They fought in public and were arrested and released. In November 1997, Debbie filed a restraining order against Goad, claiming he was beating her on a daily basis, eventually withdrawing it, stating she was \"bullied into\" filing it and was mad at Goad for having an affair with Ryan. Ryan eventually threatened to kill Goad, and he took out a restraining order against her. Goad and Debbie would divorce in 1997. In May 1998 the two had another confrontation with a fight in Goad's car outside of Portland. Goad left Ryan by the side of the road, fled to Washington, and was charged with assault and kidnapping, totaling 25 years in prison. While Goad served 7 1/2 months of pretrial prison time, Ryan befriended a dying Debbie. The two heavily publicized their relationships with Goad, who would eventually cop a plea. Ryan would go on to serve a couple of months in prison on her own unrelated assault charges. When asked if he had any remorse or guilt about beating Ryan, Goad said, \"Absolutely not. I enjoyed it.\" Starting in May 1998 he would go on to spend a year in a minimum security prison, after serving in a county jail and eventually moving into a maximum security prison. Goad served 2 1/5 years, being released in 2002.\n\nWhile Goad was in prison, author Jim Hogshire started a \"Free Jim Goad\" website, claiming that Goad was innocent and should be released from prison. Goad disagreed with the concept of the website, admitting that he was not innocent regarding his actions.\n\nUpon his release from prison in 2002, Goad returned to Portland and was on parole for a time. He wrote for \"Exotic\", a free guide to the sex industry of the Northwestern United States and DJing \"hard country with a big bass\" at a local bar. In 2008 Goad became a father. He currently maintains his website, JimGoad.net, and writes for \"Taki's Magazine\". Goad currently resides in Stone Mountain, Georgia.\n\nAs a writer, Jim Goad has been called the \"poster boy for the transgressive school of writing.\" Goad utilizes wit and a style of prose described as \"machine gun delivery,\" which reads in a fast paced manner, like \"it was written by an angry auctioneer on XTC.\" Chuck Palahniuk describes Goad's writing style as being \"brutally honest without worrying about being correct.\"\n\nGoad's work examines American culture, often popular and political culture. His early work reads anti-politically correct and as shock value, while his later work, like the \"Redneck Manifesto,\" and journalism contributions have marked Goad as a political and societal commentator. His political and social views have been called \"Proto-Marxist,\" by book reviewer Matt Parrott, who also described Goad as being \"anti-elite.\" In his political commentary he has described conservatives and liberals in the United States as \"two asscheeks surrounding the same hairy bunghole,\" and that politicians know how to take advantage of lower- and middle-class people because of a human's innate tribalism. He has stated his support for Donald Trump.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1994, Goad self-published four yearly issues of the zine \"ANSWER Me!\", with then wife Debbie Goad. It featured illustrations by Nick Bougas. With a circulation of 13,000 the magazine sought to upset politically correct thinkers by covering subjects about race and feminism. The publication was banned and seized by customs officials in several countries, and the final \"Rape Issue\", was rejected by some bookstore owners. The zine, called \"massively influential\" by \"Bizarre\", would also be credited as an inspiration by Francisco Martin Duran, who took 29 shots at the White House, influencing the suicides of three British Neo-Nazis, and a possible influence on Kurt Cobain's suicide.\n\nIn 1994, Goad signed a two-book deal with Simon & Schuster for $100,000. \"The Redneck Manifesto: How Hillbillies Hicks and White Trash Became America's Scapegoats\" was published in 1997. The book explores the idea of poor whites celebrating their heritage similar to poor African Americans, and that discrimination in the United States is focused around social class, not race. His thesis is that the rich elite blind the poor, and cause them to fight one another, instead of working together for their mutual benefit.\n\n\"Shit Magnet: One Man's Miraculous Ability to Absorb the World's Guilt\", is Goad's second book. Major New York publishing houses declined to publish \"Shit Magnet\", and it was published in 2002 by Feral House. The book, written while Goad was in prison, is an autobiography. It examines Goad's childhood, teenage years, his relationships with former wife Debbie Goad and ex-girlfriend Anne Ryan, and reflections about his time in prison and his experience with the judicial system. The book includes great detail about Oregon prison life, including detailed descriptions about fellow prisoners, of whom he writes \"forced sterilization maybe wasn't such a bad idea.\" Writer John Strausbaugh described \"Shit Magnet\" as \"extremely painful\" in detail and comparative in drama to the autobiography of Klaus Kinski. \"Humor is Dead\" calls \"Shit Magnet\" a \"sordid and often shocking personal allegory of guilt and violence.\" In 2008, a play titled \"Torn Between Two Bitches,\" was produced in Los Angeles by Michael Sargent, based on \"Shit Magnet\".\n\nHe wrote a comic called \"Trucker Fags in Denial\", which was originally published as a comic strip in the Portland-based publication \"Exotic\" and was published as a comic book by Fantagraphics in 2004. The comic, written by Goad and illustrated by Jim Blanchard, is about two truckers named Butch and Petey. The two characters are homophobic and beat up gays between trucking. The characters contradict their behavior by having a homosexual relationship with each other. The comic serves as a satirical examination of cultural scapegoating, often seen in Goad's writing. Goad came up with the idea for the comic while in prison, where he frequently observed male prisoners insulting each other as being \"fags,\" and as \"fagging off,' despite engaging in homosexual acts themselves while incarcerated. \"Willamette Week\"'s gay columnist Byron Beck described \"Trucker Fags in Denial\" as \"twisted, vile, unrepentant...and absolutely hilarious.\"\n\nIn 2007, \"Jim Goad's Gigantic Book of Sex\" was published. The book consists of over 100 articles, op-eds and facts about sex, all written by Goad.\n\nCurrently, Goad writes a weekly column for \"Taki's Magazine\" and is a writer/producer for Thought Catalog. Goad has also contributed to \"Vice\" and \"Hustler\". In 2013 Goad wrote a foreword to a compilation of issues of the 1990s zine \"Gun Fag Manifesto\". He thanked the editor, Hollister Kopp, in his book \"The Redneck Manifesto\"\n\n\"The New Church Ladies: The Extremely Uptight World of \"Social Justice\"\", a collection of essays, was published February 13, 2017 by Obnoxious Books.\n\nJim Goad has released music and performed as Big Red Goad. In 2007 he toured with Hank III. Goad cites trucker music as an influence on his own music.\n\nIn 2002 Goad acted in \"The Suzy Evans Story\", a film about a police detective who protects a battered woman named Suzy and proceeds to abuse her himself. Goad acknowledges that it was typecasting. The film was never released.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1579491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1579491", "title": "Jèrriais literature", "text": "Jèrriais literature\n\nJèrriais literature is literature in Jèrriais, the Norman dialect of Jersey in the Channel Islands.\n\nThe literary tradition in Jersey is traced back to Wace, the 12th century Jersey-born poet, although there is little surviving literature in Jèrriais dating to before the introduction of the first printing press in Jersey in the 1780s. The first printed Jèrriais appears in the first newspapers at the end of the 18th century, and the earliest identified dated example of printed poetry is a fragment by Matchi L’Gé (Matthew Le Geyt 1777–1849) dated 1795.\n\nAn astonishing boom in competing newspapers and journals throughout the 19th century provided a platform for poets and writers to publish regularly in the feuilletons - typically, satirical comment on the week’s news, elections, politicians and notables. Annual almanacs (up until 1958) reprinted favourite poems and stories that had appeared throughout the year, or specially composed pieces.\n\nThe copious Dgèrnésiais poetry published in Guernsey by George Métivier (nicknamed the \"Guernsey Burns\") from around 1818 inspired similar literary activity in Jersey. The international interest in Robert Burns's Scots poetry provided the background to a conscious effort by Channel Island writers to promote vernacular literature.\n\nMatthew Le Geyt (1777–1849) was the first poet to publish in Jèrriais following the introduction of printing. The earliest dated piece of his writing comes from 1795. He was from St Helier but he must have lived in Trinity as well where he was a Vingtenier. It is suggested that Le Geyt was influenced by the Norman language \"purin\" literature of Rouen.\n\nSatirical playlets were published in newspapers in the 19th century. \"Élection de St. Martin\", a playlet in Jèrriais and French published in the newspaper \"Le Constitutionnel\" on 24 November 1838, was probably never staged, but rather read in company. Henri Luce Manuel's play in rhyming couplets \"Queur de Femme\" (in modern spelling: \"Tchoeu d'Femme\" - \"heart of a woman\") of 1861 was published in pamphlet form.\n\nThe first printed anthology of Jèrriais poetry, \"Rimes Jersiaises\", was published in 1865 by Abraham Mourant. It collected works by Matthew Le Geyt, \"Laelius\" (Sir Robert Pipon Marett 1820 - 1884, Bailiff of Jersey 1880 - 1884), \"L.\" (Henri Luce Manuel), Esther Le Hardy, and \"L'Anmîn Flip\" (Philippe Asplet). Some Dgèrnésiais is also included in the form of mutual tributes in verse between Laelius and George Métivier. This anthology enjoyed great popularity in continental Normandy. It included dramatic duologues, which may have been performed at traditional \"veil'yes\" (social neighbourhood gatherings) or read as closet dramas.\n\nSir Robert Pipon Marett’s prestige and influence also helped to reinforce the movement towards standardisation of the writing system based on French orthography, a trend which was also helped by the nascent Norman literary revival in the neighbouring Cotentin area of mainland Normandy where writers, inspired by the example of the Norman writers of Jersey and Guernsey, began their own production of literary works.\n\nFrançois-Victor Hugo reproduced an extract from Laelius's \"La Fille Malade\" in his \"La Normandie inconnue\", which spread awareness of Jèrriais literature far beyond Jersey but which overstated Laelius's literary influence in Jersey since Sir Robert Pipon Marett's literary production dwindled as he took on high office. Laelius is the most quoted poet from this period and the most popular in mainland Normandy, most probably because of his familiarity with and fidelity to French classical models, as well as the fact that his writing is generally less satirical than his contemporaries and therefore requires less knowledge of Jersey institutions, events and personalities.\n\nOther influential writers include \"A.A.L.G.\" (Augustus Asplet Le Gros 1840 - 1877) and \"St.-Luorenchais\" (Philippe Langlois 1817 - 1884).\n\nLe Gros was among the first generation to be educated at Victoria College, the school founded by the States of Jersey on the model of English public schools. Although he trained for the law, he became a farmer by profession, and moved into politics, being elected Constable of St. Peter and eventually Jurat. He was a founder of the Société Jersiaise. He wrote poetry in English, two volumes of which were published in London in 1863 and 1868, but was most devoted to poetry in Jèrriais. He edited an annual literary anthology called \"La Nouvelle Année\", dedicated to the Norman literature of Jersey and Guernsey, between 1868 and 1875.\n\nPhilippe Langlois came from a St. Lawrence family, hence his pen name. He studied medicine in Paris and Dublin, qualifying as a doctor. He served as Deputy in the States of Jersey and on 27 June 1876 he was elected Jurat. He was president of La Société Jersiaise, and started work on a dictionary of Jèrriais - in the \"Glossaire du Patois Jersiais\" published by the Société in 1924 and based partly on Langlois' lexicographic foundations, his poem \"Lé Jèrriais\" was reprinted (from \"La Nouvelle Année\" of 1875) as a frontispiece. This poem describes features of the various dialects of the language around the Island.\n\nPhilippe Asplet (1818–1893) wrote under the name of \"Flip\" or \"L'Anmin Flippe\". He was a Trinity man, although he was born in St. Martin and died in Grouville. His spelling shows the typical \"z\" instead of \"th\" that was typical of the now-disappeared Faldouet dialect. He was a Centenier and often wrote verses on parish elections. His work appeared in the satirical newspaper \"La Voix des Îles\", frequently as captions to caricatures. He was a supporter of Victor Hugo and the French proscrits, and attacked the decision to force Hugo to leave Jersey. The Lieutenant-Governor tried to force Asplet to resign as Centenier because of his links with the proscrits, but L'Anmin Flippe refused and made public the correspondence. He spent a number of years in Paris and was clearly influenced by French poetry.\n\nJean Sullivan (or John Sullivan, 1813–1899) wrote under the pen-names \"Oméga\" or \"J.S.\" and is the only author known to have claimed to write in the now-disappeared St. Helier dialect, although his spelling is so idiosyncratic that it is difficult to identify which features might be typical of that dialect and which represented his personal fancies. Victor Hugo described him as \"un vrai Poëte\" (a true poet), although his highly coloured style full of classical allusions and antiquarianism mean that his popularity is restricted nowadays. He was a devoted monarchist, writing many poems on royal subjects, and in 1884 received permission from Buckingham Palace to translate Queen Victoria's \"More leaves from the Highlands\" into Jèrriais. This project, like many others announced by Sullivan, remained unpublished or unfinished.\n\nEsther Le Hardy's three-act play in rhyming couplets \"L'Enchorchelai, ou les très Paires\" (in modern spelling: \"L'Enchorchélé, ou les Trais Paithes\" - \"The Bewitched, or the Three Pears\") was published in 1880.\n\nThe de Faye sisters, Mathilda (born 1846, who wrote under the nom de plume \"Georgie\") and Alice (1849–1925, who wrote under the nom de plume \"Livonia\"), wrote mostly about the social scene, with an interest in fashion, novelties and social events.\n\nPhilippe Le Sueur Mourant (1848–1918) wrote under several pseudonyms. His first great success was with the character \"Bram Bilo\", a self-important but naïve countryside notable. Having eventually killed off his best-known character, in 1911 he launched, under the name of \"Piteur Pain\", a new series of articles in newspapers relating the adventures and opinions of the Pain family, newly moved to Saint Helier and its anglicized society and fashionable entertainments. The Bram Bilo stories remained more popular, being reprinted a number of times since. They were also translated into Dgèrnésiais by Thomas Grut in the 1920s and published in \"La Gazette de Guernesey\". It has also been suggested that the \"Bram Bilo\" stories influenced the writing of the Orne writer, Octave Maillot.\n\nTwo volumes entitled \"Patois Poems of the Channel Islands\" were published (from 1883) by John Linwood Pitts in Guernsey. They included poems by A.A. Le Gros, Laelius, Philippe Asplet, Philippe Langlois, and Henri Luce Manuel – all with parallel English verse translations.\n\nJean Picot (1846–1922) was born in St. Helier but of an old Trinity family. A farmer by profession, when an injury forced him into retirement he took up literature. He wrote under the pen name of \"J.P.\", especially for \"La Nouvelle Chronique de Jersey\" and its Almanac. He often undertook translations from English, notably versions of poems by Robert Service, and of \"Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lectures\" genre pieces by Douglas Jerrold, originally published in Punch in the 1840s which may have later influenced Edward Le Brocq's \"Ph'lippe et Merrienne\" stories. His verses are metrical rather than syllabic.\n\n\"Elie\" (Edwin J. Luce 1881–1918) was editor of the French language newspaper \"La Nouvelle Chronique de Jersey\" and a poet who wrote topical poems for the newspaper. He was also active in promoting the development of drama in Jèrriais and organised performances, ultimately leading to the establishment of a Jèrriais section of the Jersey Eisteddfod in 1912. Unfortunately for the language, he died at a young age in the influenza pandemic of 1918. His brother, Philip W. Luce (1882–1966), also a journalist and poet (nom de plume \"Ph'lippe d'la Golarde\"), emigrated to Canada, but sent occasional writings back to Jersey.\n\n\"Caouain\" (George W. De Carteret 1869 - 1940) maintained a weekly newspaper column purporting to be the work of an owl (\"cahouain\") who flew from parish hall to parish hall to report on the latest election news and local gossip. The domestic ructions of the owl and his wife, Marie Hibou, also provided a humorous commentary on social attitudes. G.W. De Carteret also wrote recitations in verse and playlets for the annual Eisteddfod competitions.\n\nBesides Edmund Blampied's work in the visual arts, he also amused himself and his friends by writing poetry in Jèrriais, signing himself as \"Un Tout-à-travèrs\". He wrote nonsense verse for children. In 1933, \"La Chronique de Jersey\" considered publishing a booklet of Blampied poems illustrated by the artist himself, but the plans came to nothing.\n\nDuring the Occupation (1940–1945), little original writing was permitted to be published by the German military censorship. However very many older pieces of literature were re-published in the newspapers as an act of cultural self-assertion and morale-boosting. Some literature circulated clandestinely, such as Edmund Blampied's words for an insulting anti-Hitler song entitled \"La chanson Hitleur\" written in 1944. The inability of the Germans to understand Jèrriais enabled the performance of dramas that would otherwise not have passed the censor. A Jèrriais play performed at a parish hall was \"as patriotic as could possibly be\" but the Germans who attended the production did not understand it.\n\nAfter the Occupation and with the re-establishment of a free press, the re-opened English language newspaper, \"The Morning News\", under the editorship of Edward Le Brocq (1877–1964) revived the weekly column in 1946 with a letter from \"Ph'lip et Merrienne\", supposedly a traditional old couple from St. Ouen who would comment on the latest news or recall time past. On the final closure of the \"Morning News\" in 1949, the letters transferred to the last remaining French language newspaper in Jersey, \"Les Chroniques de Jersey\" until its closure in turn in 1959 when they transferred to the \"Evening Post\" until the author's death in 1964.\n\nThe most influential writer of Jèrriais in the 20th century was a U.S. citizen, George Francis Le Feuvre (1891–1984) whose pen-name was \"George d’la Forge\". He emigrated to North America after the First World War but for almost forty years maintained a flow of articles in Jèrriais back to Jersey for publication in newspapers, first in \"Les Chroniques de Jersey\" (1946–1954) and later in the \"Evening Post\" (subsequently \"Jersey Evening Post\" ) (1964–1984). Selections of his articles have been published in book form as \"Jèrri Jadis\" and \"Histouaithes et Gens d'Jèrri\".\n\nFrank Le Maistre (1910–2002) (known as \"Dr. Fraînque Le Maistre\", although his doctorate was honorary), compiler of the dictionary, maintained a literary output starting in the 1930s with newspaper articles under the pseudonym \"Marie la Pie\", poems, magazine articles, research into toponymy and etymology. He himself considered his masterpiece the translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam that he undertook during the German Occupation.\n\nThe foundation of \"L'Assembliée d'Jèrriais\", a body to preserve and promote the language, in 1952 led to the publication of a quarterly journal, \"Lé Bulletîn d'Quart d'An\", providing a literary outlet for Jèrriais which became even more important after the closure of \"Les Chroniques de Jersey\" in 1959. The editor was Frank Le Maistre.\n\n\"Lé Bulletîn d'Quart d'An\" ceased publication in 1977, having notched up a quarter-century, and was replaced by \"Les Chroniques du Don Balleine\" (1979–1987) which in turn gave way to the current \"Les Nouvelles Chroniques du Don Balleine\" (winner of the \"Prix Littéraire du Cotentin\" in 1993).\n\nFollowing the death of George d'la Forge, Sir Arthur de la Mare (1914–1994), a retired ambassador, took over the task of contributing regular columns to the newspaper. Written in the Trinity dialect, as distinct from the St. Ouen dialect used by George d'la Forge and Frank Le Maistre which is laid out in the standard grammar of Jèrriais and the standard dictionaries, Sir Arthur's articles included reminiscences of his life as a diplomat, especially in Japan, Thailand and Singapore, as well as comments on events and politics in Jersey. Sir Arthur's mix of foreign tales and domestic farming comments continued the pattern set by George d'la Forge who alternated between reminiscences of his youth in Jersey, his life in North America and travels round the world, and commentary on news sent from Jersey. Since Sir Arthur's death, a roster of contributors have maintained the tradition of the weekly newspaper column.\n\n\n"}

It is the traditional language of the Karuk people, most of whom now speak English. The name is derived from the word \"Káruk\", which means 'upriver'.\n\nThe Karuk language originated around the Klamath River between Seiad Valley and Bluff Creek. Prior to European contact, it is estimated that there may have been up to 1,500 speakers. Linguist William Bright documented the Karuk language and when Bright began his studies in 1949 there were \"a couple of hundred fluent speakers,\" but by 2011, there were fewer than a dozen fluent elders. A standardized system for writing the languages was adopted in the 1980s.\n\nKaruk is a language isolate, sharing few if any similarities with other nearby languages. Historically, the American linguist Edward Sapir proposed it be classified as part of the Hokan family he hypothesized although little evidence supports this proposal. As Bright wrote, \"The Karok language is not closely or obviously related to any other (in the area), but has been classified as a member of the northern group of Hokan languages, in a subgroup which includes Chimariko and the Shasta languages, spoken in the same general part of California as Karok itself.\"\n\nKaruk is spoken within the range of the original territory where the Karuk people lived prior to European contact. The ancestral territory is in Northwestern California existing in Siskiyou, Humboldt, and Del Norte counties. The language originated around the Klamath River between Seiad Valley and Bluff Creek. Karuk is most notably found in towns Somes Bar, which is near The Karuk Center of the World (in Karuk, \"Katimiin\"), Happy Camp (\"Athithufvuunupma\"), and Orleans (\"Panamniik\").\n\nThere are only 5 vowels in Karuk, as shown by the chart, where \"a\", \"i\", and \"u\" have both long and short forms, while \"e\" and \"o\" are in the long form.\n\nKaruk only has 16 consonants, a small compared to the relatively large consonant inventories of most California languages. Karuk also does not show any modifications to its consonants like glottalization or labialization, also unusual for a California language.\n\nWhen two high vowels are juxtaposed in a word, then the first vowel turns into a glide in the following examples.\n\n\"Note: Syllabification in these examples are from right-to-left.\"\n\nThe following example is a more rare case in Karuk where the syllabification is from left-to-right.\n\nKaruk is a polysynthetic language known for its method of arranging old and new information: \"... skilled Karuk speakers use separate words to communicate new, salient detail, or to underscore known detail; and they use affixes for background details so that a listener's attention is not diverted.\"\n\nKaruk is similar to many other American Indian Languages because \"verbs bear a complex person-marking system, where subject and object are marked in portmanteau prefixes.\" Depending on the subject and the object the speaker is referring to, there is a prefix for both positive and negative indicatives, as well as a prefix for the potential mood. Through his research, William Bright found there to insufficient words to describe cardinal directions, but the language uses suffixes on verbs to describe relevant direction. Many motion verbs have a singular and plural form. Through morphology, long-form vowels are used when \"a\" is next to \"i\" or \"u\". Karuk uses accents where vowels can sound differently in each word, making the language difficult to learn. Although the structure may be similar, Karuk is considered to be much different than its neighboring languages, such as Yurok.\n\nKaruk uses prefixes and suffixes in a way William Bright relates to how English words \"snort\", \"sniff\", and \"sneeze\" all start with a \"sn-\". The following are examples of prefixes in Karuk.\n\n\"Note: More translations can be found online in the Dictionary section depicting Dr. Bright's research.\"\n\nDr. William Bright started studying the Karuk language in 1949 in pursuit of his doctorate in linguistics at U.C Berkeley. Bright was met with open arms by tribal elders and was taken in and called Uhyanapatánvaanich, or \"little word-asker\" in Karuk. A little under a decade later, Bright published \"The Karok Language\" (University of California), which was a highly informative piece on the Karuk language, its grammar, and syntax. Bright worked with Susan Gehr, a tribe member and fellow linguist, on a Karuk dictionary, which was published in 2005. Bright was a different type of linguist because he did not see language without cultural context. He would record everyday conversations, songs, stories, and poetry of fluent Karuk speakers to attempt to capture the language and what it meant to those speaking it. He spent over fifty years studying, researching, and documenting Karuk, and is the only non-Indian to be inducted as an honorary member of the tribe thanks to his contributions to the community. Bright was buried on Karuk land when he died in 2006.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Humboldt State University started the \"American Indian Bilingual Teacher Credential Program\", where they brought in teachers from four local tribes, being the Hupa, Yurok, Karuk, and Tolowa. These teachers were bilingual in their tribe's native language as well as English, and would be employed in local public schools to teach American Indian children. The university developed this initiative to help local American Indian populations either further develop their English for higher education or improve upon their native language to preserve culture. Bilingual teachers in both Karuk and English would teach Orleans Elementary and Happy Camp Elementary, where children would learn how to live in America while keeping their identity.\n\nIn 1990, attempts were made to revive the language by The Karuk Language Restoration Committee. This committee, composed of eight volunteers, drafted a 5-year minimum plan in attempt to preserve the Karuk language and help it grow in the future. The committee was also advised by Dr. William Bright and tribal member Julian Lang, a dedicated researcher of the language. Their studies showed that the decline of the language is caused by a combination of a lack of younger fluent speakers, the number of speakers is falling in general, it is not typically taught at home at young ages, it is not flexible to be modernized, and most tribal members cannot read the Karuk language.\n\nThe committee ultimately created a five-step plan:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22339905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22339905", "title": "Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate", "text": "Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate\n\nThe concept of linguistic relativity concerns the relationship between language and thought, specifically whether language influences thought, and, if so, how. This question has led to research in multiple disciplines—especially anthropology, cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophy. Among the most popular and controversial theories in this area of scholarly work is the theory of linguistic relativity (also known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis). An often-cited \"strong version\" of the claim, first given by Lenneberg in 1953, proposes that language structure determines how we perceive the world. A \"weaker version\" of this claim posits that language structure \"influences\" the world view of speakers of a given language but does not determine it.\n\nThere are two formal sides to the color debate, the universalist and the relativist. The universalist side claims that the biology of all human beings is all the same, so the development of color terminology has absolute universal constraints. The relativist side claims that the variability of color terms cross-linguistically (from language to language) points to more culture-specific phenomena. Because color exhibits both biological and linguistic aspects, it has become a deeply studied domain that addresses the relationship between language and thought. In a 2006 review of the debate Paul Kay and Terry Regier concluded that \"The debate over color naming and cognition can be clarified by discarding the traditional 'universals versus relativity' framing, which collapses important distinctions. There are universal constraints on color naming, but at the same time, differences in color naming across languages cause differences in color cognition and/or perception.\"\n\nThe color debate was made popular in large part due to Brent Berlin and Paul Kay's famous 1969 study and their subsequent publishing of \"\". Although much on color terminology has been done since Berlin and Kay's famous study, other research predates it, including the mid-nineteenth century work of William Ewart Gladstone and Lazarus Geiger, which also predates the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, as well as the work of Eric Lenneberg and Roger Brown in 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe universalist theory that color cognition is an innate, physiological process rather than a cultural one was introduced in 1969 by Brent Berlin and Paul Kay in their book \"\". Their study was intended to challenge the formerly prevailing theory of linguistic relativity set forth by Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf. Berlin and Kay found universal restrictions on the number of basic color terms (BCTs) that a language can have, and on the ways the language can use these terms. The study included data collected from speakers of twenty different languages from a range of language families. Berlin and Kay identified eleven possible basic color categories: white, black, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange, and gray. To be considered a basic color category, the term for the color in each language had to meet certain criteria:\n\n\nIn case of doubt, the following \"subsidiary criteria\" were implemented:\n\nBerlin and Kay also found that, in languages with fewer than the maximum eleven color categories, the colors followed a specific evolutionary pattern. This pattern is as follows:\n\n\nIn addition to following this evolutionary pattern absolutely, each of the languages studied also selected virtually identical focal hues for each color category present. For example, the term for \"red\" in each of the languages corresponded to roughly the same shade in the Munsell color system. Consequently, they posited that the cognition, or perception, of each color category is also universal.\n\nA later study supporting this universal, physiological theory was done by Kessen, Bornstein, and Weiskopf. In this study, sixteen four-month-old infants were presented with lights of different frequencies corresponding to different colors. The lengths of habituation were measured and found to be longer when the infant was presented with successive hues surrounding a certain focal color than with successive focal colors. This pattern of response is what is expected when the infants are distinguishing between the focal colors, but not distinguishing between successive hues (i.e. different shades of red are all \"red\" but \"blue\" and \"red\" focal colors are different). This is to say that infants respond to different hues of color in much the same way as adults do, demonstrating the presence of color vision at an age younger than previously expected. Kessen, Bornstein and Weiskopf therefore claim that the ability to perceive the same distinct focal colors is present even in small children.\n\nIn their paper \"Language and thought: Which side are you on anyway?\", Regier et al. discuss the presence of a universalist perspective on the color debate in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\"In the mid-nineteenth century, various scholars, notably William Gladstone (1858) and Lazarus Geiger (1880), noted that the speakers of ancient written languages did not name colors as precisely and consistently – as they saw it – as the speakers of modern European languages. They proposed a universal evolutionary sequence in which color vocabulary evolves in tandem with an assumed biological evolution of the color sense\".\nGladstone was a Homeric scholar and in his writings, notably \"Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age\", expressed that, because there was virtually a lack of color terminology in Homeric Greek literature, Greeks could probably not see color as we can today.\n\" ... that the organ of color and its impressions were but partially developed among the Greeks of the heroic age\".\nGeiger expanded on Gladstone's ideas by looking at other classic works and hypothesized that man gradually became aware of color over time. He posited the idea that this awareness was connected to the order colors came up in the spectrum, starting with longest wavelengths.\n\nLenneberg and Roberts presented their paper \"The Denotata of Color Terms\" at the Linguistic Society of America in 1953. In this paper they reported their findings on color recall in Zuni speakers. Zuni has one color term for yellow and orange, and Lenneberg and Roberts' study reported that Zuni speakers encountered greater difficulty in color recall for these colors than English speakers, who have available terms to distinguish them. Brown and Lenneberg attributed this effect to the property of codability.\n\nLinguistic codability is the ease with which people can name things and the effects of naming on cognition and behavior.\n\nBrown and Lenneberg published \"A Study in Language and Cognition\" in 1954, where they discussed the effect of codability on recognition. In their experiment they used a series of Munsell chips to test color recall and recognition in English speakers. Their findings suggested that the availability of a basic color term in a given language affected the retention of that color in recall testing. Brown and Lenneberg linked their study to Lenneberg and Roberts' 1953 findings on color recall in Zuni speakers.\n\nInitially, Berlin and Kay's theory received little direct criticism. But in the decades since their 1969 book, a significant scholarly debate has developed surrounding the universalism of color terminology. Many relativists find significant issues with this universalism. Discussed below, Barbara Saunders and John A. Lucy are two scholars who are prominent advocates of the opposing relativist position. Also, Daniel Everett's work on the Pirahã language of the Brazilian Amazon, a controversial case, found several peculiarities, including what he interpreted as the Pirahã language's lack of color terms in the way those are otherwise defined. Everett's conclusions were met with skepticism from universalists, who claimed that the linguistic deficit is explained by the lack of need for such concepts.\n\nBarbara Saunders believes that Berlin and Kay's theory of basic color terminology contains several unspoken assumptions and significant flaws in research methodology. Included in these assumptions is an ethnocentric bias based on traditions of Western scientific and philosophical thought. She regards the evolutionary component of Berlin and Kay's theory as \"an endorsement of the idea of progress\" and references Smart's belief that it is \"a Eurocentric narrative that filters everything through the West and its values and exemplifies a universal evolutionary process of modernization.\"\n\nWith regard to Berlin and Kay's research, Saunders criticizes the translation methods used for the color terms they gathered from the 78 languages they had not studied directly. Like many others, she also questions the effectiveness of using the Munsell color system in the elicitation of color terminology and identification of focal hues. She feels that \"use of this chart exemplifies one of the mistakes commonly made by the social sciences: that of taking data-sets as defining a (laboratory) phenomenon which supposedly represents the real world\", and entails \"taking a picture of the world for the world and then claiming that that picture is the concept\". Finally, she takes issue with the anomalous cases of color term use that she believes Berlin, Kay and Merrifield disregarded in their work on the \"World Color Survey\" for the purpose of purifying their results.\n\nIn Saunders' 1997 article with van Brakel, they criticize the amount of weight given to the study of physiological color perception as support for the universalism of color terminology. They primarily criticize the idea that there is an autonomous neuro-physiological color pathway, citing a lack of concrete evidence for its existence.\n\nSaunders is also bothered by the overall de-contextualization of color terminology and the failure of universalists to address the limitations of their methodologies. She points out that:\n\"Ordinary colour talk is used in a variety of ways – for flat coloured surfaces, surfaces of natural objects, patches of paintings, transparent objects, shining objects, the sky, flames, illumination, vapours, volumes, films and so on, all of which interact with overall situation, illumination, edges, textures, patternings and distances, making the concept of sameness of colour inherently indeterminate\".\n\nJohn A. Lucy's criticisms of Berlin and Kay's theory are similar to those of Saunders and other relativists, primarily focusing on shortcomings in research methodologies and the assumptions that underlie them.\n\nLucy believes that there are problems with how linguistic analysis has been used to characterize the meanings of color terms across languages. Referential range (what a color term can refer to) and grammatical distribution (how the term can be used) are two dimensions Lucy believes are critical to defining the meaning of a term, both of which \"are routinely ignored in research on color terms which focuses primarily on denotational overlap across languages without any consideration of the typical use of the terms or their formal status.\" He also feels that any attempt to contrast color term systems requires understanding of each individual language and the systems it uses to structure reference.\n\nLucy also believes that there is significant bias present in the design of Berlin and Kay's research, due to their English-speaking and Western points of view. He thinks the use of the Munsell color system demonstrates their adherence to the ideas that \"speech is about labeling accuracy\" and that \"Meaning is really about accurate denotation,\" which he believes \"...both derive directly from the folk understandings of English speakers about how their language works.\" He refers to Conklin's study of Hanunóo as a demonstration of what a study might reveal about a language's color term system when such bias is not present. He demonstrates that \"an 'adequate knowledge' of the system would never have been produced by restricting the stimuli to color chips and the task of labeling\" (original emphasis).\n\nIn summation, he feels that the approach universalists have taken in researching color term universals sets up a procedure that \"...guarantees both their discovery and their form,\" and that, \"It does not really even matter whether the researchers involved are open-minded and consciously willing to recognize relativism as a possible outcome—because the universalist conclusion is guaranteed by their methodological assumptions.\"\n\nScholarship on color vision has proceeded in three principal domains within the last twenty years. There have been revisions to the Berlin & Kay hypothesis; in response, there have been continued challenges to that hypothesis; and lastly, the field of vision science has expanded to explore hue categorization at a perceptual level, independent of language-based distinctions, possibly offering compromise in the two polar theories.\n\nIn 1999 Paul Kay and Luisa Maffi published an article entitled \"Color Appearance and the Emergence and Evolution of Basic Color Lexicons\", in which they outline a series of revisions in response to data collected in the World Color Survey (WCS) and to Stephen Levinson and his work on the language Yélî Dnye in Papua New Guinea (see below). While upholding an evolutionary track for the addition of basic color terms (BCTs) to any given lexicon, they outlined a series of three Partition Rules (i.e., superordinate rules that determine the evolution of BCTs):\n\n\nThe ordering of these rules is reflective of the data of the overwhelming majority of languages studied in the WCS. However, exceptions do exist, as was accounted for by Yélî Dnye and other languages within the WCS. Furthermore, they also propose a 0) rule, one which simply states: partition. Such a rule is necessary to motivate the specification of later basic color terms, namely those that can no longer be brought about by application of rules 1)–3).\n\nWith respect to the evolution of color terms within a given lexicon, Kay and Maffi further outlined the possibilities of different trajectories of evolution, though all of those numerically possible are not attested in the World Color Survey. Another significant contribution of this article is a discussion of the Emergence Hypothesis (see below), its relation to Yélî Dnye, and its motivation for the authors' revision of evolutionary trajectories.\n\nUsing phylogenetic approach, Bowern & Haynie found support for Berlin & Kay hypothesis in the Pama-Nyungan language family, as well as other alternative trajectories for gaining and losing color terms.\n\nHere are three approaches to such critiques:\n\nIn an article titled \"The Semantics of Colour: A New Paradigm\", Wierzbicka discusses three main critiques of the universalist approach:\n\n\nWith regard to 1), she states that \"the basic point ... is that, in many languages, one cannot ask the question, 'What color is it?'\" The assumption oscillates between two versions: on the one hand she argues that languages with no superordinate word for color simply do not have minimal color terms. On the other hand, she argues that even if one contests the first point (i.e., agree that languages that lack a word for color still have color terms), the fact that one cannot ask the question she posits (above) means that color is not a salient semantic domain in these languages. In the structure of her Natural Semantic Metalanguage, color does not constitute a semantic \"primitive\", though she argues for many others cross-linguistically. (For more on the NSM related to color terms, see \"Theoretical Linguistics\" 29:3.)\n\nThis study compares the evolutionary model of color terms of Berlin & Kay to the acquisition of color terms in children (something which has been thought to lag behind other lexical acquisitions). Their study proceeds to three main questions:\n\n\nWith regard to 1), they find that color terms are not acquired any later than other relevant lexemes to distinguish objects. It had been thought, for example, that since color is not necessarily unique to a given object, and diverse objects are more likely to share common color than a common shape, that color terms lagged behind shape terms in development. This was found not to be the case.\n\nSecond, they found no correlation between the order of color term acquisition in children and in languages generally. It was found that gray and brown are learned later in development; there was no preference for the six primary color terms over the remaining three secondary ones. The similarity between the acquisition of these terms in children and in language vocabularies was assumed to be comparable, since even in current notions of the B&K hypothesis the evolutionary order of color terms is thought to be based on universals of neurophysiology. While some studies in neurophysiology have shown greater salience for the basic color terms (and thus correlate their earlier evolutionary status), neurophysiology has not been able to account for such phenomena as intuitive separations of warm and cool colors (the second partition rule posited by Kay [see above] is essential to such early-onset warm/cool distinctions, yet is overridden in language with a yellow/green/blue color term).\n\nThe Yele language is a language isolate spoken on Rossel Island in Papua New Guinea. Among observations about the class, derivation, usage of, and disagreement over, color naming words in Yele is a critique of the BCT-model's assumption that languages which have not yet fully lexicalized the semantic space of color (as was posited to be universal in the original and subsequent B&K papers [1969 &1978]) with the use of all eleven basic color names do so by use of the fewer composite terms that they do possess (by B&K's criteria for Yele, three). As Stephen Levinson argues using methodology similar to that used by B&K for their initial tests and later for the WCS, there are simply regions of the color spectrum for which Yele has no name, and which are not subsumed by larger composite categories, even despite the inventive nature of color terms in Yele that fall outside the criteria for \"basic\" status. Given the fact that such color naming words are extremely inventive, (a \"semi-productive\" mode of adjectival derivation is the duplication of related nouns), Levinson argues that this is highly detrimental to the BCT-theory, insomuch that Yele is \"a language where a semantic field of color has not yet jelled\", and thus one not open to universal constraint.\n\nAs Levinson points out, there is evidence that supports the emergence of BCTs through physical objects and words used to signify simultaneous properties such as lightness. As such, these terms do not cohere as a unique, separable semantic domain denoting hue (see Bornstein for this criterion). Over time, though, and through processes of semantic change, such a domain can emerge. In response to work by Levinson and Lyons, Kay dubs this perspective the Emergence Hypothesis (EH). (See Levinson's article for a discussion on the co-existing evolutionary tracks for color words if one accepts both B&K's position and the Emergence Hypothesis.) Kay & Maffi (1999) incorporate the EH into their evolutionary track by removing from their model the assumption that languages begin by fully segmenting the color spectrum. This inverts their Partition Principles (see above), namely by placing 1) and 3) over 0) and 2). That is, languages partially segment the space into black, white, and red (i.e., 1) & 3)), and then the assignment to partition (0)) and split warm and cool colors (2)) accommodates the rest of the space. As Kay & Maffi explain, this is essential to explications of Y/G/Bu terms (e.g., Cree), which were previously incompatible with the model. However, this model also introduces the possibility for previously divergent evolutionary paths for color terms, since it is only after the rearrangement and reassignment of the Partition Principles that a language that derived from EH origins joins with a language that originally partitioned the whole of the color spectrum.\n\nMarc Bornstein's essay \"Hue Categorization and Color Naming: Physics to Sensation to Perception\" separates an analytical review of vision science and color naming into three sections:\n\n\nAs a result, he summarizes both the findings of vision science (as it relates to color naming) and the linking of three separate but causally related processes within the study of color naming phenomena. He states that \"the physics of color, the psychophysics of color discrimination, and the psychology of color naming are not isomorphic\". The color spectrum clearly exists at a physical level of wavelengths (inter al.), humans cross-linguistically tend to react most saliently to the primary color terms (a primary motive of Bornstein's work and vision science generally) as well as select similar exemplars of these primary color terms, and lastly comes the process of linguistic color naming, which adheres both to universal patterns but demonstrates individual uniqueness. While one may have origins in its predecessor, variation among test subjects in vision science and linguistic variation demonstrate that it is not a process of whole causality. In his companion essay, he demonstrates that this process of causality may indeed be reversed, which he explains through a set of \"models of development\":\n\n\nIn response, there are three ways that outside experience may affect this development: through (A) induction, (B) modification, or (C) deprivation. Thus the logical possibilities are 1A & 1C; 2A, 2B & 2C; and 3B & 3C. Using this format, he explains that developmental altering in hue categories \"entail perceptual 'sharpening' and 'broadening'\". He attributes this to either \"maturation\" (perceptually) or \"experience\". Such a conclusion is necessarily indeterminate because understanding of why certain hue categories are lost and others induced (cf. developmental processes above) \"requires further exacting research\". Coming from these two perspectives (i.e., those outlined in the causation above, and the models of development), this leads Bornstein to conclude that \"there appear to be nontrivial biological constraints on color categorization [and that] ... the available evidence seems compatible with a position of moderate universality that leads to expectations of probabilistic rather than deterministic cross-cultural correspondence\", and that \"in color, relativism appears to overlay a universalist foundation\".\n\n\n"}

Though there is an ongoing debate concerning their interrelationships, the Muskogean languages are generally divided into two branches, Eastern Muskogean and Western Muskogean. They are agglutinative languages. Although only 1 language is extinct, Apalachee, all surviving languages are critically endangered.\n\nThe Muskogean family consists of six languages which are still spoken: Alabama, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek-Seminole, Koasati, and Mikasuki, as well as the now-extinct Apalachee, Houma, and Hitchiti (the last is generally considered a dialect of Mikasuki). \"Seminole\" is listed as one of the Muskogean languages in Hardy's list, but it is generally considered a dialect of Creek rather than a separate language, as she comments (Hardy 2005:70; see also Mithun 2005:462, Crawford).\n\nThe major subdivisions of the family have long been controversial, but the following lower-level groups are universally accepted: Choctaw–Chickasaw, Alabama–Koasati, Hitchiti–Mikasuki, and Creek–Seminole. Because Apalachee is extinct, its precise relationship to the other languages is uncertain; Mary Haas and Pamela Munro both classify it with the Alabama–Koasati group.\n\nFor connections among these groupings, the traditional classification is that of Mary Haas and her students, such as Karen Booker, in which \"Western Muskogean\" (Choctaw-Chickasaw) is seen as one major branch, and \"Eastern Muskogean\" (Alabama-Koasati, Hitchiti-Mikasuki, and Creek-Seminole) as another. Within Eastern Muskogean, Alabama-Koasati and Hitchiti-Mikasuki are generally thought to be more closely related to each other than to Creek-Seminole. That classification is reflected in the list below:\n\n\nA more recent and controversial classification has been proposed by Pamela Munro. In her classification, the languages are divided into a \"Southern Muskogean\" branch (Choctaw-Chickasaw, Alabama-Koasati, and Hitchiti-Mikasuki) and a \"Northern Muskogean\" one (Creek-Seminole). Southern Muskogean is the subdivided into Hitchiti-Mikasuki and a \"Southwestern Muskogean\" branch containing Alabama-Koasati and \"Western Muskogean\" (Choctaw-Chickasaw). The classification is reflected in the list below:\n\nNorthern Muskogean:\n\nSouthern Muskogean:\n\nA third proposed classification is that of Geoffrey Kimball, who envisions a threeway split among the languages, with \"Western Muskogean\" (Choctaw-Chickasaw), \"Eastern Muskogean\" (Creek-Seminole), and \"Central Muskogean\" (Alabama-Koasati and Hitchiti-Mikasuki). However, Kimball's classification has not received as much support as either Haas's or Munro's.\n\nSeveral sparsely attested languages have been claimed to be Muskogean languages. George Broadwell suggested that the languages of the Yamasee and Guale were Muskogean. However, William Sturtevant argued that the \"Yamasee\" and \"Guale\" data were Creek and that the language(s) spoken by the Yamasee and Guale people remain unknown. It is possible that the Yamasee were an amalgamation of several different ethnic groups and did not speak a single language. Chester B. DePratter describes the Yamasee as consisting mainly of speakers of Hitchiti and Guale. The historian Steven Oatis also describes the Yamasee as an ethnically mixed group that included people from Muskogean-speaking regions, such as the early colonial-era native towns of \"Hitchiti\", \"Coweta\", and \"Cussita\".\n\nThe Pensacola and Chatot (or Chacato) people are reported to have spoken the same Muskogean language, which may have been closely related to Choctaw.\n\nSparse evidence indicates that a Muskogean language was spoken by at least some of the people of the paramount chiefdom of Cofitachequi in northeastern South Carolina. If so, that would be the most eastern outpost of Muskogean. The people of Cofitichequi were probably absorbed by nearby Siouan and Iroquoian speakers in the late 17th century.\n\nA vocabulary of the Houma may be another underdocumented Western Muskogean language or a version of Mobilian Jargon. Mobilian Jargon is a pidgin based on Western Muskogean.\n\nThe best-known connection proposed between Muskogean and other languages is Mary Haas' Gulf hypothesis, in which she conceived of a macrofamily comprising Muskogean and a number of language isolates of the southeastern US: Atakapa, Chitimacha, Tunica, and Natchez. While well-known, the Gulf grouping is now generally rejected by historical linguists. A number of Muskogean scholars continue to believe that Muskogean is related to Natchez.\n\nProto-Muskogean is reconstructed as having the consonants (given in IPA transcription):\n\nThe phonemes reconstructed by Haas as and show up as and (or ), respectively, in all Muskogean languages; they are therefore reconstructed by some as and . appears as in all the daughter languages except Creek for which it is initially and medially. The value of the proto-phoneme conventionally written (or ) is unknown; it appears as in Western Muskogean languages and as in Eastern Muskogean languages. Haas reconstructed it as a voiceless (that is, ), based partly on presumed cognates in Natchez.\n\nMost family languages display lexical accent on nouns and grammatical case which distinguishes the nominative from the oblique. Nouns do not obligatorially inflect for gender or number.\n\nMuskogean verbs have a complex ablaut system; the verbal stem almost always changes depending on aspect; less commonly, it is affected by tense or modality. In Muskogean linguistics, the different forms are known as \"grades.\"\n\nVerbs mark for first and second person, as well as agent and patient (Choctaw also marks for dative). Third-persons (he, she, it) have a null-marker.\n\nPlurality of a noun agent is marked by either affixation on the verb or an innately plural verbal stem:\n\nPluralization via affixation, Choctaw:\n\nInnately-numbered verbal stems, Mikasuki:\n\n\n"}

Such clones have arisen through mutation of a regular (\"non-musqué\") clone of the variety, and such mutations have been recorded for several different grape varieties.\n\nThe most well-known \"musqué\" grape is Gewürztraminer, which is a \"musqué\" mutation of a red-skinned Traminer, which is also known as Savagnin rose in France.

{"id": "2229041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229041", "title": "N400 (neuroscience)", "text": "N400 (neuroscience)\n\nThe N400 is a component of time-locked EEG signals known as event-related potentials (ERP). It is a negative-going deflection that peaks around 400 milliseconds post-stimulus onset, although it can extend from 250-500 ms, and is typically maximal over centro-parietal electrode sites. The N400 is part of the normal brain response to words and other meaningful (or potentially meaningful) stimuli, including visual and auditory words, sign language signs, pictures, faces, environmental sounds, and smells.\n\nThe N400 was first discovered by Marta Kutas and Steven Hillyard in 1980. They conducted the first experiment looking at the response to unexpected words in read sentences, expecting to elicit a P300 component. The P300 had previously been shown to be elicited by unexpected stimuli. Kutas and Hillyard therefore used sentences with anomalous endings (i.e.\"I take coffee with cream and dog), expecting to see a P300 to the unexpected sentence-final words. However, instead of eliciting a large positivity, these anomalous endings elicited a large negativity, relative to the sentences with expected endings (i.e. \"He returned the book to the library) In the same paper, they confirmed that the negativity was not just caused by any unexpected event at the end of a sentence, since a semantically expected but physically unexpected word (i.e. \"She put on her high-heeled SHOES\") elicited a P300 instead of negativity in the N400 window. This finding showed that the N400 is related to semantic processing, and is not just a response to unexpected words.\n\nThe N400 is characterized by a distinct pattern of electrical activity that can be observed at the scalp. As its name indicates, this waveform peaks around 400 ms post-stimulus onset, with negativity that can be observed in the time window ranging from 250-500 ms. This latency (delay between stimulus and response) is very stable across tasks—little else besides age affects the timing of its peak. The N400 is a negative component, relative to reference electrodes placed on the mastoid processes (the bony ridge behind the ear), and relative to a 100 ms pre-stimulus baseline. Its amplitude can range from -5 to 5 microvolts. However, it is important to note that in studies using the N400 as a dependent measure, the relative amplitude of the waveform compared to another experimental condition (the \"N400 effect\") is more important than its absolute amplitude. The N400 itself is not always negative—it is just a more negative-going deflection than that seen to other conditions. Its distribution is maximal over centro-parietal electrode sites, and is slightly larger over the left side of the head for visual words, although the distribution can change slightly depending on the eliciting stimulus.\n\nA typical experiment designed to study the N400 will usually involve the visual presentation of words, either in sentence or list contexts. In a typical visual N400 experiment, for example, subjects will be seated in front of a computer monitor while words are presented one-by-one at a central screen location. Stimuli must be presented centrally because eye movements will generate large amounts of electrical noise that will mask the relatively small N400 component. Subjects will often be given a behavioral task (e.g., making a word/nonword decision, answering a comprehension question, responding to a memory probe), either after each stimulus or at longer intervals, to ensure that subjects are paying attention. Note, however, that overt responses by the subject are not required to elicit the N400—passively viewing stimuli will still evoke this response.\n\nAn example of an experimental task used to study the N400 is a priming paradigm. Subjects are shown a list of words in which a prime word is either associatively related to a target word (e.g. bee and honey), semantically related (e.g. sugar and honey) or a direct repetition (e.g. honey and honey). The N400 amplitude seen to the target word (honey) will be reduced upon repetition due to semantic priming. The amount of reduction in amplitude can be used to measure the degree of relatedness between the words.\n\nAnother widely used experimental task used to study the N400 is sentence reading. In this kind of study, sentences are presented to subjects centrally, one word at a time, until the sentence is completed. Alternatively, subjects could listen to a sentence as natural auditory speech. Again, subjects may be asked to respond to comprehension questions periodically throughout the experiment, although this is not necessary. Experimenters can choose to manipulate various linguistic characteristics of the sentences, including contextual constraint or the cloze probability of the sentence-final word (see below for a definition of cloze probability) to observe how these changes affect the waveform's amplitude.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the N400 response is seen to all meaningful, or potentially meaningful, stimuli. As such, a wide range of paradigms can be used to study it. Experiments involving the presentation of spoken words, acronyms, pictures embedded at the end of sentences, music, and videos of real-word events, have all been used to study the N400, just to name a few.\n\nExtensive research has been carried out to better understand what kinds of experimental manipulations do and do not affect the N400. General findings are discussed below.\n\nThe frequency of a word's usage is known to affect the amplitude of the N400. With all else being constant, highly frequent words elicit reduced N400s relative to infrequent words. As previously mentioned, N400 amplitude is also reduced by repetition, such that a word's second presentation exhibits a more positive response when repeated in context. These findings suggest that when a word is highly frequent or has recently appeared in context, it eases the semantic processing thought to be indexed by the N400, reducing its amplitude.\n\nN400 amplitude is also sensitive to a word's neighborhood size, or how many other words differ from it by only one letter (e.g. \"boot\" and \"boat\"). Words with large neighborhoods (that have many other physically similar items) elicit larger N400 amplitudes than do words with small neighborhoods. This finding also holds true for pseudowords, or pronounceable letter strings that are not real words (e.g. flom), which are not themselves meaningful but look like words. This has been taken as evidence that the N400 reflects general activation in the comprehension network, such that items that look like many words (regardless of whether it itself is a word) partially activate the representations of similar-looking words, producing a more negative N400.\n\nThe N400 is sensitive to priming: in other words, its amplitude is reduced when a target word is preceded by a word that is semantically, morphologically, or orthographically related to it.\n\nIn a sentence context, an important determinant of N400 amplitude elicited by a word is its cloze probability. Cloze probability is defined as the probability of the target word completing that particular sentence frame. Kutas and Hillyard (1984) found that a word's N400 amplitude has a nearly inverse linear relationship with its cloze probability. That is, as a word becomes less expected in context, its N400 amplitude is increased relative to more expected words. Words that are incongruent with a context (and thus have a cloze probability of 0) elicit large N400 amplitudes as well (although the amplitude of the N400 for incongruent words is also modulated by the cloze probability of the congruent word that would have been expected in its place Relatedly, the N400 amplitude elicited by open-class words (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) is reduced for words appearing later in a sentence compared to earlier words. Taken together, these findings suggest that when the prior context builds up meaning, it makes the processing of upcoming words that fit with that context easier, reducing the N400 amplitude they elicit.\n\nWhile the N400 is larger to unexpected items at the end of a sentence, its amplitude is generally unaffected by negation that causes the last word to be untrue and thus anomalous. For example, in the sentence \"A sparrow is a building, the N400 response to \"building\" is more negative than the N400 response to bird in the sentence \"A sparrow is a bird. In this case, building has a lower cloze probability, and so it is less expected than \"bird\". However, if negation is added to both sentences in the form of the word \"not\" (i.e. \"A sparrow is not a building and \"A sparrow is not a bird), the N400 amplitude to \"building\" will still be more negative than that seen to \"bird\". This suggests that the N400 responds to the relationship between words in context, but is not necessarily sensitive to the sentence's truth value. More recent research, however, has demonstrated that the N400 can sometimes be modulated by quantifiers or adjectives that serve negation-like purposes, or by pragmatically licensed negation.\n\nAdditionally, grammatical violations do not elicit a large N400 response. Rather, these types of violations show a large positivity from about 500-1000 ms after stimulus onset, known as the P600.\n\nA striking feature of the N400 is the general invariance of its latency. Although many different experimental manipulations affect the amplitude of the N400, few factors (aging and disease states and language proficiency being rare examples) alter the timing of the N400 component.\n\nAlthough localization of the neural generators of an ERP signal is difficult due to the spreading of current from the source to the sensors, multiple techniques can be used to provide converging evidence about possible neural sources. Using methods such as recordings directly off the surface of the brain or from electrodes implanted in the brain, evidence from brain damaged patients, and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings (which measure magnetic activity at the scalp associated with the electrical signal measured by ERPs), the left temporal lobe has been highlighted as an important source for the N400, with additional contributions from the right temporal lobe. More generally, however, activity in a wide network of brain areas is elicited in the N400 time window, suggesting a highly distributed neural source (See Kutas & Federmeier, 2011, for a more complete discussion).\n\nThere is still much debate as to exactly what kind of neural and comprehension processes the N400 indexes. Some researchers believe that the underlying processes reflected in the N400 occur after a stimulus has been recognized. For example, Brown and Hagoort (1993) believe that the N400 occurs late in the processing stream, and reflects the integration of a word's meaning into the preceding context (see Kutas & Federmeier, in press, for a discussion). However, this account cannot explain why items that themselves have no meaning (e.g. pseudowords) also elicit the N400. Other researchers believe that the N400 occurs much earlier, before words are recognized, and represents orthographic or phonological analysis.\n\nMore recent accounts posit that the N400 represents a broader range of processes indexing access to semantic memory. According to this account, it represents the binding of information obtained from stimulus input with representations from short- and long-term memory (such as recent context, and accessing a word's meaning in long term memory) that work together to create meaning from the information available in the current context (Federmeier & Laszlo, 2009; see Kutas & Federmeier, in press). As research in the field of electrophysiology continues to progress, these theories will likely be refined to include a complete account of just what the N400 represents.\n\n"}
{"id": "3106991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3106991", "title": "Obligatory Contour Principle", "text": "Obligatory Contour Principle\n\nThe Obligatory Contour Principle (frequently abbreviated OCP) is a hypothesis in autosegmental phonology that states that (certain) consecutive identical features are banned in underlying representations. The OCP is most frequently cited when discussing the tones of tonal languages (stating for example that the same morpheme may not have two underlying high tones), but it has also been applied to other aspects of phonology.\n\nA commonly held conception within phonology is that no morpheme is allowed to contain two consecutive high tones. If two consecutive high tones appear within a single morpheme, then some rule must have applied . Maybe one of the surface high-tone vowels was underlyingly high-toned, while the other was underlyingly toneless. Then, since all vowels must have tone at the surface (in this hypothetical language), the high tone of the one vowel spreads onto the other (see: autosegmental phonology). Alternatively, one (or both) of the vowels may have started out low-toned and become high-toned due to the application of some rule; or perhaps there was a low tone between the two high tones that got deleted at some point. Regardless, the OCP claims that there can not have been two consecutive high tones (nor two consecutive low tones, etc.) in the underlying representation of the morpheme, i.e. in the morpheme's lexical entry.\n\nThe \"locus classicus\" of the OCP is , in which it was formulated as a morpheme-structure constraint precluding sequences of identical tones from underlying representations. In autosegmental phonology , with articulated conceptions about associations between featural melodies and skeletal units (i.e. CV phonology, see , , , ), moraic phonology (Hyman 1985, Hayes 1989), the OCP was considered to be relevant to adjacent singly linked melodies but not to doubly linked melodies. The OCP in this 'rules and constraints' era was no longer simply a constraint on underlying forms, but also began to play a role in the course of a phonological derivation. proposed that the OCP can actively block the application of or repair the output of phonological rules, while in , Moira Yip attempted to extend the role of the OCP to trigger the application of rules as well. However, there was also a strong opposition to the OCP as a formal constraint in phonological theory, headed by David Odden. showed that, contrary to the contemporaneous assumption that constraints were inviolable, an examination of African tonal systems reveals many apparent surface violations of the OCP. A lively debate continued between John McCarthy and David Odden for several years, with each adding an extra 'anti-' to the title of the previous article of the other - e.g. \"Anti anti-gemination and the OCP\" , a reply to .\n\nIn Optimality Theory (OT) (), the OCP has been again redefined as a violable constraint. Yet many issues as to its precise formal character remain: (i) locality - what is the domain of the OCP (i.e. strict adjacency? etc.) and how is the domain represented in the theory; (ii) near-identical sequences - many languages show an OCP-like resistance to sequences of segments that differ in just one distinctive feature; is this the effect of the OCP, some other constraint? If the latter, how is this constraint formally related to the OCP; (iii) status as an OT constraint - is the OCP a single constraint, or is it the local self-conjunction of markedness constraints (Alderete 1997)? These and other issues related to the OCP continue to be hotly debated in phonological theory.\n\nA particular instance of the OCP is Meeussen's Rule , named after the Belgian Bantu specialist A. E. Meeussen, which has been used to explain how a sequence HH tones becomes HL in various Bantu languages.\n\n\n"}

In addition, the line is very opaque and, unlike spirit-based or other permanent inks, will not fade with exposure to UV light, and overlays all other colors beneath it. The paint from these types of markers is not truly permanent, as it can be removed using high pressure cleaning or paint thinning solvents such as acetone.\n\nPaint markers, and permanent markers generally, contain the toxic compounds xylene or toluene. Like spray paint, these markers give off volatile organic compounds, which can be dangerous when not used in a well ventilated area or with a particulate mask. Gloves can also be worn to avoid absorption through the skin.\n\nAnother type of paint marker is the solidified paint pen. This is a type of marker, often contained within a twist tube, that is a cylinder of semi-hardened oil-paint with a pointed tip. As one writes with it, the point wears down and must be advanced to in order to continue writing. The marker leaves a mark similar to that of chalk. It is useful for marking on wet or oily surfaces. It is sold under the brand name MeanStreak in the United States and generic versions are also available online. It is made by Sanford, the maker of Sharpies, but there are many different brands and types of solidified paint pens.\n\nPaint pens are used for a variety of purposes. Their most general usage is on windows, and they are often used to advertise sales or discounts meant to bring prospective buyers in. Restaurant's often hire a professional artist to \"paint\" with the markers on their windows.

{"id": "40253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40253", "title": "Precognition", "text": "Precognition\n\nPrecognition (from the Latin \"prae-\", \"before\" and \"cognitio\", \"acquiring knowledge\"), also called prescience, future vision, future sight is a claimed psychic ability to see events in the future.\n\nAs with other forms of extrasensory perception, there is no accepted scientific evidence that precognition is a real phenomenon and it is widely considered to be pseudoscience. Precognition also appears to violate the principle of causality, that an effect cannot occur before its cause.\n\nPrecognition has been widely believed in throughout history. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many people still believe it to be real; it is still widely reported and remains a topic of research and discussion within the parapsychology community.\n\nSince ancient times, precognition has been associated with trance and dream states involved in phenomena such as prophecy, fortune telling and second sight, as well as waking premonitions. These phenomena were widely accepted and reports have persisted throughout history, with most instances appearing in dreams.\n\nSuch claims of seeing the future have never been without their sceptical critics. Aristotle carried out an inquiry into allegedly prophetic dreams in his \"On Divination in Sleep\". He accepted that \"it is quite conceivable that some dreams may be tokens and causes [of future events]\" but also believed that \"most [so-called prophetic] dreams are, however, to be classed as mere coincidences...\". Where Democritus had suggested that emanations from future events could be sent back to the dreamer, Aristotle proposed that it was, rather, the dreamer's sense impressions which reached forward to the event. \n\nThe term \"precognition\" first appeared in the 17th century but did not come into common use among investigators until much later.\n\nAn early investigation into claims of precognition was published by the missionary Fr. P. Boilat in 1883. He claimed to have put an unspoken question to an African witch-doctor whom he mistrusted. Contrary to his expectations, the witch-doctor gave him the correct answer without ever having heard the question.\n\nIn the early 20th century J. W. Dunne, a British aeronautics engineer, experienced several dreams which he regarded as precognitive. He developed techniques to record and analyse them, identifying any correspondences between his future experiences and his recorded dreams. He reported his findings in his 1927 book \"An Experiment with Time\". In it he alleges that 10% of his dreams appeared to include some element of future experience. He also persuaded some friends to try the experiment on themselves, with mixed results. Dunne concluded that precognitive elements in dreams are common and that many people unknowingly have them. He suggested also that dream precognition did not reference any kind of future event, but specifically the future experiences of the dreamer. He was led to this idea when he found that a dream of a volcanic eruption appeared to foresee not the disaster itself but his subsequent misreading of an inaccurate account in a newspaper. In 1932 he helped the Society for Psychical Research to conduct a more formal experiment, but he and the Society's lead researcher Theodore Besterman failed to agree on the significance of the results. Nevertheless the Philosopher C. D. Broad remarked that, \"The only theory known to me which seems worth consideration is that proposed by Mr. Dunne in his Experiment with Time.\"\n\nIn 1932 Charles Lindbergh's infant son was kidnapped, murdered and buried among trees. The psychologists Henry Murray and D. R. Wheeler tested precognitive dreams by inviting the public to report any dreams of the child. A total of 1,300 dreams were reported. Only five percent envisioned the child dead and only 4 of the 1,300 envisioned the location of the grave as amongst trees. This number was no better than chance.\n\nThe first ongoing and organized research program on precognition was instituted by Joseph Banks Rhine in the 1930s at Duke University's Parapsychology Laboratory. Rhine used a method of forced-choice matching in which participants guessed the order of a deck of 25 cards, each five of which bore one of five geometrical symbols. Although his results were positive and gained some academic acceptance, his methods were later shown to be badly flawed and subsequent researchers using more rigorous procedures were unable to reproduce his results.\n\nSamuel G. Soal was described by Rhine as one of his harshest critics, running many similar experiments with wholly negative results. However from around 1940 he ran forced-choice ESP experiments in which a subject attempted to identify which of five animal pictures a subject in another room was looking at. Their performance on this task was at chance, but when the scores were matched with the card that came \"after\" the target card, three of the thirteen subjects showed a very high hit rate. Rhine now described Soal's work as \"a milestone in the field\". However analyses of Soal's findings, conducted several years later, concluded that the positive results were more likely the result of deliberate fraud. The controversy continued for many years more. In 1978 the statistician and paragnost Betty Markwick, while seeking to vindicate Soal, discovered that he had tampered with his data. The untainted experimental results showed no evidence of precognition.\n\nAs more modern technology became available, more automated techniques of experimentation were developed that did not rely on hand-scoring of equivalence between targets and guesses, and in which the targets could be more reliably and readily tested at random. In 1969 Helmut Schmidt introduced the use of high-speed random event generators (REG) for precognition testing, and experiments were also conducted at the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab. Once again, flaws were found in all of Schmidt's experiments, when the psychologist C. E. M. Hansel found that several necessary precautions were not taken.\n\nIn 1963 the BBC television programme \"Monitor\" broadcast an appeal by the writer J.B. Priestley for experiences which challenged our understanding of Time. He received hundreds of letters in reply and believed that many of them described genuine precognitive dreams. In 2014 the BBC Radio 4 broadcaster Francis Spufford revisited Priestley's work and its relation to the ideas of J.W. Dunne.\n\nDavid Ryback, a psychologist in Atlanta, used a questionnaire survey approach to investigate precognitive dreaming in college students. His survey of over 433 participants showed that 290 or 66.9 percent reported some form of paranormal dream. He rejected many of these reports, but claimed that 8.8 percent of the population was having actual precognitive dreams.\n\nG. W. Lambert, a former Council member of the SPR, proposed five criteria that needed to be met before an account of a precognitive dream could be regarded as credible:\n\nIn 2011 the psychologist Daryl Bem, a Professor Emeritus at Cornell University, published findings showing statistical evidence for precognition in an upper tier journal, the \"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology\". The paper was heavily criticised and the criticism widened to include the journal itself and the validity of the peer review process. Public controversy over the paper continued until in 2012 the results were published of an independent attempt to reproduce Bem's results, which failed to do so.\n\nClaims of precognition are, like any other claims, open to scientific criticism. However the nature of the criticism must adapt to the nature of the claim.\n\nClaims of precognition are criticised on two main grounds:\n\nConsequently, precognition is widely considered to be pseudoscience.\n\nPrecognition would violate the principle of antecedence (causality), that an effect does not happen before its cause. Information passing backwards in time would need to be carried by physical particles doing the same. Experimental evidence from high-energy physics suggests that this cannot happen. There is therefore no direct justification for precognition from physics.\"\n\nPrecognition contradicts \"most of the neuroscience and psychology literature, from electrophysiology and neuroimaging to temporal effects found in psychophysical research.\" It is considered a delusion by mainstream psychiatry.\n\nThe relatively new discovery of evidence for quantum retrocausality is sometimes suggested as a possible mechanism for precognition. However it is generally held that such \"quantum weirdness\", even if it is shown to exist, cannot carry information at a macroscopic level.\n\nA great deal of evidence for precognition has been put forward, both as witnessed anecdotes and as experimental results, but none has yet been accepted as rigorous scientific proof of the phenomenon.\n\nVarious known psychological processes have been put forward to explain experiences of apparent precognition. These include:\n\n\nPremonitions have sometimes affected the course of important historical events. Related activities such as prophecy and fortune telling have been practised throughout history and are still popular today.\n\nDespite the lack of scientific evidence, many people still believe in precognition. A 1978 poll found that 37% of Americans surveyed believed in it. According to some psychologists, belief is greater in college women than in men, and a 2007 poll found that women were more prone to superstitious beliefs in general. Some studies have been carried out on psychological reasons for such a belief. One such study suggested that greater belief in precognition was held by those who feel low in control, and the belief can act as a psychological coping mechanism.\n\nJ. W. Dunne's main work \"An Experiment with Time\" was widely read and \"undoubtedly helped to form something of the imaginative climate of [the interwar] years\", influencing many writers of both fact and fiction both then and since. Major writers whose work was significantly influenced by his ideas on dream precognition include H. G. Wells, J. B. Priestley and Vladimir Nabokov. Philippa Pearce's 1958 childhood fantasy \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" won the British literary Carnegie Medal.\n\n\n\n"}

Those inventors had no expectations whatever that radio would become a major mass media entertainment and information medium earning many millions of dollars in revenues annually through radio advertising commercials or sponsorship. These latter uses were brought about after 1920 by business entrepreneurs such as David Sarnoff, who created the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and William S. Paley, who built Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). These broadcasting (as opposed to narrowcasting) business organizations began to be called network affiliates, because they consisted of loose chains of individual stations located in various cities, all transmitting the standard overall-system supplied fare, often at synchronized agreed-upon times. Some of these radio network stations were owned and operated by the networks, while others were independent radio owned by entrepreneurs allied with the respective networks. By selling blocks of time to advertisers, the medium was able to quickly become profitable and offer its products to listeners for free, provided they invested in a radio receiver set.\n\nThe new medium had grown rapidly through the 1930s, vastly increasing both the size of its audience and its profits. In those early days, it was customary for a corporation to sponsor an entire half-hour radio program, placing its commercials at the beginning and the end. This is in contrast to the pattern which developed late in the 20th century in both television and radio, where small slices of time were sold to many sponsors and no corporation claimed or wanted sponsorship of the entire show, except in rare cases. These later commercials also filled a much larger portion of the total program time than they had in the earlier days.\n\nIn the early radio age, content typically included a balance of comedy, drama, news, music and sports reporting. Variety radio programs included the most famous Hollywood talent of the day. During the 1920s, radio focused on musical entertainment, the \"Grand Ole Opry\", has been focused on broadcasting country music since it began in 1925. Radio soap operas began in the U.S. in 1930 with \"Painted Dreams\". \"Lørdagsbarnetimen\", a Norwegian children's show, with its premiere in 1924 interrupted only by the Second World War, was the longest running radio show in the world until it ceased production in 2010.\n\nIn the early 1950s, television programming eroded the popularity of radio comedy, drama and variety shows. By the late 1950s, radio broadcasting took on much the form it has today strongly focused on music, talk, news and sports, though drama can still be heard, especially on the BBC.\n"}

Common sources of secondary data for social science include censuses, information collected by government departments, organizational records and data that was originally collected for other research purposes. Primary data, by contrast, are collected by the investigator conducting the research.\n\nSecondary data analysis can save time that would otherwise be spent collecting data and, particularly in the case of quantitative data, can provide larger and higher-quality databases that would be unfeasible for any individual researcher to collect on their own. In addition, analysts of social and economic change consider secondary data essential, since it is impossible to conduct a new survey that can adequately capture past change and/or developments. However, secondary data analysis can be less useful in marketing research, as data may be outdated or inaccurate.\n\nSecondary data can be obtained from different sources:\n\nGovernment departments and agencies routinely collect information when registering people or carrying out transactions, or for record keeping – usually when delivering a service. This information is called administrative data.\n\nIt can include:\n\n\nA census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. It is a type of administrative data, but it is collected for the purpose of research at specific intervals. Most administrative data is collected continuously and for the purpose of delivering a service to the people.\n\nSecondary data is available from other sources and may already have been used in previous research, making it easier to carry out further research. It is time-saving and cost-efficient: the data was collected by someone other than the researcher. Administrative data and census data may cover both larger and much smaller samples of the population in detail. Information collected by the government will also cover parts of the population that may be less likely to respond to the census (in countries where this is optional).\n\nA clear benefit of using secondary data is that much of the background work needed has already been carried out, such as literature reviews or case studies. The data may have been used in published texts and statistics elsewhere, and the data could already be promoted in the media or bring in useful personal contacts. Secondary data generally have a pre-established degree of validity and reliability which need not be re-examined by the researcher who is re-using such data.\n\nSecondary data can provide a baseline for primary research to compare the collected primary data results to and it can also be helpful in research design.\n\nHowever, secondary data can present problems, too. The data may be out of date or inaccurate. If using data collected for different research purposes, it may not cover those samples of the population researchers want to examine, or not in sufficient detail. Administrative data, which is not originally collected for research, may not be available in the usual research formats or may be difficult to get access to.\n\nWhile 'secondary data' is typically associated with quantitative databases, analysis focused on verbal or visual materials created for another purpose, is a legitimate avenue for the qualitative researcher. Actually one could go as far as claim that qualitative secondary data analysis “can be understood, not so much as the analysis of pre-existing data; rather as involving a process of re-contextualising, and re-constructing, data.”\n\nIn the analysis of secondary qualitative data, good documentation cannot be underestimated as it provides future researchers with the background and context and allows replication.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "504995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=504995", "title": "Slovene grammar", "text": "Slovene grammar\n\nThe following is an overview of the grammar of the Slovene language.\n\nAs in most other Slavic languages, changes to consonants and vowels often occur between related forms of words. Most of these can be traced back to changes that occurred in the ancestral Proto-Slavic language. Over time, many of the original changes have been reversed or levelled out.\n\n\nThe following table gives an overview of the above changes:\n\nThese changes are very similar to those found in the related Serbo-Croatian language, but in iotation, Slovene \"j\" corresponding to Serbo-Croatian \"đ\", and \"č\" with \"ć\".\n\nWord stems that end in c, č, š, ž or j are called \"soft\" stems, while the remainder is \"hard\". When endings begin with -o-, this vowel usually becomes -e- after a soft stem; this is called \"preglas\" in Slovene. This happens in many noun and adjective declensions, and also in some verbs. For example, the instrumental singular form of \"korak\" \"step\" is \"korakom\", while for \"stric\" \"uncle\" it is \"stricem\".\n\nThere are also some instances where the vowel stays as \"o\", such as the accusative singular of feminine nouns. These instances can be traced back to an earlier nasal vowel \"ǫ\" in Proto-Slavic, which did not undergo this change.\n\nWhen certain hard-to-pronounce consonant clusters occur word-finally, an additional fill vowel is inserted before the last consonant(s) of the word to break up the cluster. This typically happens where there is no ending, like in the nominative singular, or the genitive dual and plural. The fill vowel is usually a schwa (, spelled \"e\"). For example, the noun \"igra\" \"game\" has the genitive plural form \"iger\", not \"igr\".\n\nIf the last consonant is \"j\", then \"i\" is used as the fill vowel instead. For example, \"ladja\" \"boat\" has the genitive plural \"ladij\". However, if the stem ends in \"lj\", \"nj\" or \"rj\", then the fill vowel is the normal \"e\" and is inserted before \"both\" consonants. The noun \"ogenj\" \"fire\", for example, loses the fill vowel in the genitive singular form \"ognja\".\n\nThere are a few cases where the fill vowel is instead a stressed \"a\". These are irregular and must simply be memorized. An example is \"ovca\" \"sheep\", which is \"ovac\" in the genitive plural, not \"ovec\".\n\nNouns are marked for case and number. There are 6 cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and instrumental) and 3 numbers (singular, dual, and plural). Slovenian nouns are divided into 3 genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). Each gender has different declension patterns, for a total of 10 declension forms.\n\nThe adjective expresses three main ideas: quality (qualitative adjectives, \"kakovostni pridevniki\"), relation (relational adjectives, \"vrstni pridevniki\") and possession (possessive adjectives, \"svojilni pridevniki\").\n\nAdjectives in Slovenian can serve in three syntactical functions: left attributes (levi prilastek), predicate articles (povedkovo določilo) and predicate attributes (povedkov prilastek).\n\nThe majority of adjectives are of the first kind. These express any qualities and properties of personal and impersonal nouns. Such adjectives are gradable either in the two- or three-step comparison, depending if they are relative to another, opposite adjective (three-step) or not (two-step or three-step). (\"lep - grd\" (beautiful - ugly) vs \"bolan\" (ill)).\n\nRelational adjectives express type, class or numerical sequence of a noun. For instance: \"kemijska in fizikalna sprememba\" (chemical and physical change), \"fotografski aparat\" (photographic device (=camera)).\n\nPossessive pronouns define possession, ownership or belonging. For example: \"barvin sijaj\" (the colour's shine), \"Karmenina torbica\" (Karmen's handbag), \"delavska halja\" (workers' overall).\n\nSome adjectives expressing \"properties\" next to masculine nouns imply definiteness ('relation') or indefiniteness ('quality') of nouns.<br>\nFor an exactly defined noun or a specific type thereof:\nFor nouns not exactly defined, being mentioned for the first time or generic:\nAdjectives ending in \"-i\" and all possessive pronouns do not have special indefinite forms. There are two special adjectives which have special definite and indefinite forms for all genders and all cases, namely \"majhen\" (small) and \"velik\" (big) (the definite forms are \"mali\" and \"veliki\" respectively):\n\n\nThe adjective matches the subject or the predicate article to which it is ascribed. If it describes two singular nouns or one dual noun, the adjective should be in the dual. If it describes a plural or one singular and one non-singular noun, the adjective should be in the plural. Although gender should match the group, sometimes the gender of the adjacent noun is used with the appropriate grammatical number. For declension patterns of adjectives, see the section on nouns (the fourth declension is always adjectival). Some adjectives, however, are never declined, for example \"bež\" (beige), \"poceni\" (cheap), \"roza\" (pink), \"super\" (super), \"seksi\" (sexy), and some other loanwords.\n\nPossessive adjectives for masculine and neuter possessed nouns add \"-ov\" (or \"-ev\" if the possessive noun ends in \"c\", \"č\", \"ž\", \"š\" and \"j\" (\"preglas\")) to the possessive noun. Feminine possessed nouns always take \"-in\". Possessive nouns can include proper names, in which case they are written capitalised.\n\nNegative adjectives are formed by prefixing the negative \"ne-\", which is \"almost\" always a proper form even though sometimes, a Latin prefix is an alternative.\n\nThe \"comparative\" is formed by adding the ending \"-ši\" (\"-ša\", \"-še\"), \"-ejši\" (\"-ejša\", \"-ejše\") or \"-ji\" (\"-ja\", \"-je\") to an adjective, or using the word \"bolj\" (more) in front of an adjective in case of stressing and also when the adjective in question cannot be formed by adding an ending, such as when dealing with colours, or when the adjective ends in such a sound that it would be difficult to add the appropriate ending:\n\n\nThe \"superlative\" is formed by prepending the word \"naj\" directly in front of the comparative, whether it comprises one or two words.\n\n\nIn Slovenian, the verbs are conjugated for 3 persons and 3 numbers (singular, dual, and plural). There are 4 tenses (present, past, pluperfect, and future), 3 moods (indicative, imperative, and conditional) and 2 voices (active and passive). Verbs also have 4 participles and 2 verbal nouns (infinitive and supine). Not all combinations of the above are possible for every case.\n\nA gerund is a noun formed from a verb, designating an action or a state. The standard substantive in Slovenian ends in \"-anje\" or \"-enje\":\n\n\nFor example:\n\nThe adverb in Slovene is always the same as the singular neuter form of any given adjective if derived from an adjective.\n\n—> \"Imeli smo se \"lepo\".\" (literally, \"We had ourselves nicely.\", the meaning is 'We had a nice time.')\n\n—> \"Govorili so \"lepo\".\" (They spoke nicely.)\n\nOther types of adverb are derived from nouns (doma (at home), jeseni (in autumn)), prepositional constructions (naglas (aloud), pozimi (in winter), potem (then)), verbs (nevede (unknowingly), skrivoma (secretly), mimogrede (by the way)) or numerals (see adverbial numeral).\n\nIn essence, there are four main types of adverb: \"adverbs of time\" (danes (today), večno (perpetually)), \"adverbs of place\" (domov (towards home, homewards)), \"adverbs of manner\" (grdo (uglily), povsem (entirely)) and \"adverbs of cause and reason\" (nalašč (on purpose)).\n\nAdverbs are, much like adjectives, normally gradable.\n\n\nPronouns can replace a noun in a sentence; this is, as opposed to, say, an adjective or an adverb.\n\nA personal pronoun denotes the speaker (\"I\"), the addressee (\"you\") or a third person (\"it\"). Personal pronouns in Slovene are inflected in a somewhat unusual way, for there are many different forms for each of the pronouns.\n\nSeveral of the pronouns have unstressed and clitic forms that are unstressed, and may attach to another word. For example:\n\nThe nominative forms of personal pronouns are not used in neutral sentences, only when emphasizing the subject, especially so for the first person singular \"jaz\" \"I\". This is because unlike in English, the form of the verb gives all applicable information such as the gender, grammatical number and person by itself.\n\n\nThe reflexive pronoun begins with \"s-\" and is used to refer back to the subject, or to some other word.\n\nFor example:\n\nSimilarly as in English, the reflexive pronoun can sometimes be replaced by the reciprocal phrase \"drug drugega\" \"each other, one another\". Thus:\n\nThe accusative \"se\" can bind with prepositional words just like other personal pronouns:\n\nOther cases and examples:\n\nThe interrogative pronouns introduce direct and indirect questions. There are two nominative forms: \"kdo\" \"who\" and \"kaj\" \"what\".\n\n\nThe substantival relative pronoun is derived from the interrogative by adding \"-r\": \"kdor\" \"who, that\", \"kar\" \"which, that\".\n\n\nThe negative pronoun is derived from the interrogative as well, and starts with \"ni-\": \"nihče\" \"nobody, anybody\", \"nič\" \"nothing, anything\".\n\nA negative pronoun demands a negative predicate, resulting in the so-called double negation:\n\n\nThe universal pronouns are \"vsakdo\" \"everyone\" and \"vse\" \"everything, all\".\n\n\n\"Vsak\" \"each, every\" is an adjective that can function as a pronoun. Also in this category are \"vsakateri\" and \"vsakteri\", both meaning \"everyone\", which are old-fashioned and not used in modern language.\n\nThe indefinite pronoun is derived from the interrogative, and starts with \"ne-\": \"nekdo\" \"someone, anyone\", \"nekaj\" \"something, anything\". It refers to an unknown or deliberately untold person or object. The inflection follows the pattern of \"kdo\" and \"kaj\".\n\n\nThe interrogatives \"kdo\" and \"kaj\", can also refer to any unspecified person or object, or one that can be chosen at will.\n\n\nThe relative indefinite pronouns are \"kdorkoli\" or \"kdor koli\" (whoever) and \"karkoli\" or \"kar koli\" (whatever). The meaning conveyed is very similar to the unspecified pronoun. The inflexion follows the pattern of the relative pronoun with \"-koli\" or \" koli\" appended. The space, as shown, is optional, but for sake of consistency, once one method has been adopted, one should not use the other.\n\n\nThe manifold pronouns are \"marsikdo\" \"many (people)\" and \"marsikaj\" \"many (things)\". The inflexion follows the basic pattern of \"kdo\" and \"kaj\". Although these pronouns refer to multiple people or things, they are grammatically singular. In addition to \"marsi-\", other prefixes are possible, such as \"redko-\" (\"redkokdo\" \"rarely anyone\"), \"mnogo-\" (\"mnogokdo\", same as \"marsikdo\", although perhaps somewhat less usual) and \"malo-\" (\"malokdo\" \"few (people)\").\n\n\nThese all inflect as regular adjectives.\n\nExample sentences:\n\nThe reflexive determiner \"svoj\" is used much as the reflexive pronoun is used, to point back to the subject or another word.\n\n\nThe reflexive possessive and 'normal' possessive pronouns make some ambiguous English sentences perfectly clear in Slovene. The sentence \"She has taken her towel into the bathroom\" can be translated into the following two ways:\n\n\nQuantitative adverbial pronouns are non-inflected at all times. All other pronouns are normally inflected.\n\nExamples:\n\nAn interjection is ordinarily an uninflected word expressing mental states, encouragement towards actions, greetings or mocking of sounds and voices.\n\n\nInterjections may be inflected; however, in spite of the words' being the same, such use calls for a different word class (part of speech), this most frequently being nouns. \n\nThe nominative case defines a subject of a sentence; all other cases define an object as either direct or indirect.\n\nThere are four types of inflexion related to the grammatical number in Slovene. The future tense is here used to demonstrate its usage. The future tense is formed with the verb to be in the future tense plus the l-participle of the full lexical verb. For example, a table of the English expression \"I will see\" (\"Jaz bom videl\") with gender for he (\"on\") and she (\"ona\") without it (\"ono\") can be written as:\n\ncan be translated into Slovene as:\n\nSlovene has singular and plural but also has the rare dual grammatical number, a separate form of every noun used when there are only two such items (except for natural pairs, such as trousers, eyes, for which the plural is used). Dual grammatical number, when an ambiguity between dual and plural forms exists, can be rendered into other languages in various ways; comparatively often, there is no ambiguity, and the dual is extraneous. (This explains the relatively early disappearance of the dual in most languages). Dual grammatical number was a feature of the Proto-Slavic language which has been retained by Slovene. An example of dual grammatical number would be \"onadva sta\" (\"The two are\"), which refers to two objects or subjects in the masculine gender or \"onidve sta\" (\"The two are\"), which refers to the same concept but in the feminine gender. However \"oni so\" (\"They are \") refers to more than two objects or subjects in the masculine gender while \"one so\" (\"They are\") does the same the feminine gender. Dual grammatical number is also preserved in gender. The dual is used consistently in Slovene.\n\nThe first phrase sounds much more romantic and intimate to a Slovene, a style that is impossible to translate into English, which lacks the dual grammatical number.\n\nIn a sentence, there can be only four types of constituent, the order of which is seldom crucial:\n\nBy changing the order, the stressed part changes. It may also serve to create poetic sentiment, common in poetry.\n\nThis is a sentence with no predicate.\n\nSee also the section on inverted commas.\n\nPunctuation marks are one or two part graphical marks used in writing, denoting tonal progress, pauses, sentence type (syntactic use), abbreviations, et cetera.\n\nMarks used in Slovene include full stops (.), question marks (?), exclamation marks (!), commas (,), semicolons (;), colons (:), dashes (–), hyphens (-), ellipses (...), different types of inverted commas and quotation marks (\"\", <nowiki>\"</nowiki>, ‚‘, „“, »«), brackets ((), [], {}) (which are in syntactical use), as well as apostrophes (',’), solidi (/), equal signs (=), and so forth.\n"}
{"id": "238672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238672", "title": "Sona language (artificial)", "text": "Sona language (artificial)\n\nSona is an international auxiliary language created by Kenneth Searight and described in a book he published in 1935. The word \"Sona\" in the language itself means \"auxiliary neutral thing\", but the name was also chosen to echo \"sonority\" or \"sound\".\n\nSearight created Sona as a response to the Eurocentricity of other artificial auxiliary languages of his time, such as Esperanto and Ido. At the same time, Searight intended his language to be more practical than most \"a priori\" languages like Solresol or Ro, which were intended to be unbiased by any particular group of natural languages. Thus, \"Sona\" sacrificed familiarity of grammar and lexicon for some measure of \"universality\", while at the same time preserving basic notions common to grammars around the world such as compounding as a method of word formation. Searight used inspiration from many diverse languages, including English, Arabic, Turkish, Chinese and Japanese, to create his eclectic yet regular and logical language.\n\nSearight specifically chose only sounds that speakers of any language could say, therefore making it a true universal. He hoped that in a perfect world, Sona would be taught to young children everywhere.\n\nSona is an agglutinative language with a strong tendency towards being an isolating language. The language has 360 \"radicals\" or root words whose meanings are based on the categories in Roget's original thesaurus, plus an additional 15 particles. Ideas and sentences are formed by juxtaposing the radicals. Thus, \"ra\" \"male\" plus \"ko\" \"child\" makes \"rako\" \"boy\".\n\nSearight's book, \"Sona; an auxiliary neutral language\" (London, K. Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., Ltd., 1935, LCCN: 35016722) is the only published example of this language. There is a small community on the Internet interested in reviving and using Sona.\n\nSona uses the Latin alphabet and contains 24 letters. Although the author provides the rules for writing in Sona in his text, he also specifies that Sona has \"few hard and fast rules.\" One mentioned rule in regards to writing covered by Searight is that foreign words are written with a capital. Even in regards to punctuation, Searight claims it is \"desirable that we leave the matter more or less opened to choice.\"\n\nThe Sona alphabet has 24 letters. Searight lists no official order but presents the following chart:\n\nThe vowels are sounded as in Italian. British English equivalents are \"fast, fete, machine, fort, rule\". \"y\" is the neutral vowel of Welsh, but before another vowel, it is pronounced as the English \"y\" (e.g. \"yard\"). The alphabet letters are \"named\" by adding the vowel \"y\". For the vowels of the alphabet, the y is initial, such as \"ya, ye, yi, yo, yu, y\", and is final for aspirates and consonants, such as \"cy, gy, ky,\" etc. The \"y\" is also useful for separating two like vowels in a word and for separating an -n radical from a vowel. For instance, \"ta-ata\" becomes \"tayata\" and \"ta-o\" becomes \"tayo\". This helps reduce confusion by distinguishing words from other similar combined radicals. \"i\" and \"u\" are shortened before a vowel. The only consonant that is final allowed is \"-n.\"\n\nThe language consists of 360 radicals and 15 particles, each of which represents a single unit of meaning. Every word in Sona can be decomposed into radicals and, conversely, new words can be constructed by combining them in various ways. Radicals are meant to represent symbolic ideas or groups of ideas, and this simplifies the language by connecting words to one another based on universal concepts.\n\nThe radicals are organized into groups of five which share both a consonant-vowel root and a fundamental meaning. Each radical in the group is created by attaching a-, u-, or i- or -n. For example, the group \"ta\" (increase) also contains the radicals \"tan\" (bulk), \"ata\" (extension), \"ita\" (filling), and \"uta\" (swelling).\n\nWhen radicals are combined, their order affects the resulting meaning. A radical used as a prefix will be dominant, while one used as a suffix will be subordinate, hence \"tara\" \"big man\" versus \"rata\" \"giant.\"\n\nA radical can change meaning depending its context. Some radicals take on a different meaning when used as an affix, e.g. when used as a prefix, the meaning of \"ka\" changes from \"lead\" to a causal maker. Many compounds take on set meanings beyond that of their component parts. For example, \"akizu\", literally \"fast animal,\" signifies \"horse.\" \n\nThe 360 radicals are split up into consonants and aspirates. Of the 12 consonants, each can be categorized five different ways, isolated and with the four possible affixes. This gives us 300 radicals. The 6 aspirates, \"c, j, x, f, v,\" and \"h\", have only the \"-n\" form, which gives us the remaining 60 radicals. Searight decided to exclude diphthongs from Sona in order to maintain its universality. Here is an example of how radicals are modified with prefixes and suffixes to create new words.\nThere are 180 disyllables, and the remaining 5 monosyllables are the particles \"au, ua, ue, ui,\" and \"uo\". The only vowels allowed as radical prefixes are \"a, i,\" and \"u.\"\n\nSona does not use a formal suffix for possession, but one may add \"-si\" for emphasis, which is the equivalent of an English \"-'s\".\n\nThe epithet is always placed before its head word, so one would say \"the big dog,\" as in English, and not \"the dog big,\" as in Spanish.\n\nWhile radicals may be compounded, they also can be isolated words. For instance, \"te\" alone means \"hand,\" but compounding it creates \"tebi\" (handle), \"bute\" (nose), and \"tega\" (arm).\n\nAs for the aspirates, \"h\" is aspirated, \"x\" is pronounced like the \"sh\" in \"shin,\" \"j\" may be sounded as in the English \"ʤ\" or the French \"ʒ\". Since there is already a letter \"k\" in Sona, \"c\" is pronounced like the \"ch\" in \"chin.\" \"f\" and \"v\" are pronounced how English speakers pronounce them.\n\nAs for the consonants, only three of them need mentioning. \"g\" is always a hard G, meaning it is pronounced like the G in Gary as opposed to the G in Gym. \"z\" is pronounced like the Z in \"zeal,\" but it can vary to the Italian variation of \"dz\", or the German variation of \"ts\". Also, \"s\" is always sharp, meaning it never sounds like a Z as in \"as.\" The remaining consonants are pronounced as English speakers would pronounce them. Sona also has no double consonants or digraphs.\n\nSona utilizes elision, meaning when a radical with a vowel prefix is followed by its own primary or \"-n\" form, the common vowel is dropped. For example, \"ata-ta\" becomes \"atta\", and \"ata-tan\" becomes \"attan\".\n\nFor foreign sounds and words, Sona uses the phonetic symbol for that word and writes it with an initial capital letter. Sona rarely utilizes capital letters, and \"Sona\" is the only word in Sona spelled with a capital letter. For technical and scientific terms, such as Greek and Latin words, Sona leaves them as is, occasionally changing an initial C to K to match the sounds, for instance \"Carnival\" becomes \"Karnival\". These words are spelled in accordance with the language of origin, and last names are not altered.\n\nSona is not a tonal language and therefore the tonic accent is evenly distributed throughout speech, such as Japanese and French.\n\nPunctuation is not a necessary part of the language since there are prefixes and suffixes for questions and emphasis. However, in Sona it is up to a person's preference whether or not they would like to use punctuation.\n\nFor nouns, the definite article is \"en\", meaning \"it,\" and is optionally used for emphasis. For instance, \"ra\" stands for \"man\", but \"en ra\" means \"the (very) man.\" There is no indefinite article in Sona. It does, however, borrow an Honorific from Japanese. O is used before names, words of address, and verbs as an expression of politeness. For instance, \"O ra\" means \"honorable man.\" It can also mean \"please.\"\n\nFor naming, the radical \"ha\", meaning \"name,\" converts another radical into a name that addresses a person. For instance, \"hara\" (name and man) signifies Mr. Monsieur, Signor, Herr, Sir, etc. Inanimate objects have no gender. Sex is marked by \"ra\", meaning male or man, and \"zan\", meaning female or woman.\n\nAll words can be fully analyzed into their constituent radicals (with the exception of proper nouns and borrowed words). As a result, the morphology of the language is a combination of isolating and agglutinating, and contains no fusional element.\n\nMost word formation is done by compounding. When compounding radicals, the first one is said to be the \"governing radical,\" and the following ones act as modifiers. The language also permits the compounding of polysyllabic words.\n\nThere are twelve cases. For nominative and accusative, the noun and the verb are compounded. For the former, the noun comes first and for the latter, the verb. For possessive, the possessor is simply placed before the possessed, but the suffix \"-si\" can be added to the possessor if needed for clarification. Three of the cases are formed with affixes: the vocative with \"-ha\", the directive with \"-li\", and the locative with \"a-.\" The remaining cases are formed analytically with a word placed before the noun: \"dili\" for the motive, \"li\" for the dative, \"ne\" for the ablative, \"bi\" for instrumental, \"vi\" for genitive, and \"di\" for partitive.\n\nNouns can optionally be marked for plural (\"-e\"), collective (-\"gi\").\n\nOnly animate nouns are marked for gender: \"ra\" for male, \"zan\" for female, and \"-ji\" or \"-ci\" for neuter, with the latter having an additional agentive meaning. The inanimates have special noun affixes which mark them as either inorganic (\"-na\") or organic (\"-ga\").\n\nThe augmentative is \"-ta-\" and the diminutive is \"-ko-\". The approbative is marked by \"-xa\" and the disapprobative is marked by \"-ze\".\n\nThe comparative is formed by \"e-\" and superlative is formed by \"en e-\" (with \"en\" meaning \"the\"). However, they do not have to be marked explicitly.\n\nBoth prepositions and pronouns may be optionally attached to the end of the verb.\n\nThree different radicals can be used to mark transitivity: -ka- (\"cause\"), -ba (\"strike, forceful\"), -ru (\"go, get\").\n\nSearight gives this verb paradigm using the root \"ru\", \"move,\" as an example:\n\nInstrumental nouns can be formed with \"-bi\"; places are denoted by \"-a, -ma,\" or \"-ca\"; buildings by \"-kan\"; times are formed with \"-ri.\"\n\nAbstract nouns may be formed in several ways. A noun of state is produced with \"-ne\", a verbal noun is produced with -\"da\", and a noun of quality is produced with \"-vi\". For example, starting with the radical \"di\", \"divide,\" one can create \"dine,\" \"division;\" \"dida\", \"dividing;\" and \"divi\", \"particularity.\"\n\nThe primary method of adjective formation is the suffix \"-(y)o\", as in \"tayo\", \"great.\" They can be used as predicates by omitting the o, as in \"ra ta\", \"the man is big.\"\n\nAdjectives with more specific meanings can be derived in several other ways. Searight gives the following list, using \"ra\", \"man,\" to generate an example of each:\nSome adverbial forms are derived by a suffix, like adjectives, while others are formed analytically. The default method of creating an adverb is the word \"po\" preceding it. Searight offers the following adverb derivations:\nRadicals can be converted into verbs analytically by the addition of \"da\" before the root.\n\nSearight's central claim on syntax in Sona is that \"the construction of the Sona sentence is based upon the logical sequence of ideas.\" The syntactical structure of Sona is intended to be as intuitive and logical as possible, although Searight does present some rules in his text under the \"Syntax\" section. According to Searight, the word order is SVO, with qualifying words preceding the words they qualify. Searight stresses that \"the construction of the Sona sentence must not be confined to European models.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1328586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1328586", "title": "UTF-EBCDIC", "text": "UTF-EBCDIC\n\nUTF-EBCDIC is a character encoding used to represent Unicode characters. It is meant to be EBCDIC-friendly, so that legacy EBCDIC applications on mainframes may process the characters without much difficulty. Its advantages for existing EBCDIC-based systems are similar to UTF-8's advantages for existing ASCII-based systems. Details on UTF-EBCDIC are defined in Unicode Technical Report #16.\n\nTo produce the UTF-EBCDIC encoded version of a series of Unicode code points, an encoding based on UTF-8 (known in the specification as UTF-8-Mod) is applied first (creating what the specification calls an I8 sequence). The main difference between this encoding and UTF-8 is that it allows Unicode code points U+0080 through U+009F (the C1 control codes) to be represented as a single byte and therefore later mapped to corresponding EBCDIC control codes. In order to achieve this, UTF-8-Mod uses 101XXXXX instead of 10XXXXXX as the format for trailing bytes in a multi-byte sequence. As this can only hold 5 bits rather than 6, the UTF-8-Mod encoding of codepoints above U+009F is generally larger than the UTF-8 encoding.\n\nThe UTF-8-Mod transformation leaves the data in an ASCII-based format (for example, U+0041 \"A\" is still encoded as 01000001), so each byte is fed through a reversible (one-to-one) lookup table to produce the final UTF-EBCDIC encoding. For example, 01000001 in this table maps to 11000001; thus the UTF-EBCDIC encoding of U+0041 (Unicode's \"A\") is 0xC1 (EBCDIC's \"A\").\n\nThis encoding form is rarely used, even on the EBCDIC-based mainframes for which it was designed. IBM EBCDIC-based mainframe operating systems, such as z/OS, usually use UTF-16 for complete Unicode support. For example, DB2 UDB, COBOL, PL/I, Java and the IBM XML toolkit support UTF-16 on IBM mainframes.\n\nThere are 160 characters with single-byte encodings in UTF-EBCDIC (compared to 128 in UTF-8). As can be seen, the single-byte portion is similar to IBM-1047 instead of IBM-37 due to the location of the square brackets. CCSID 37 has [] at hex BA and BB instead of at hex AD and BD respectively.\n\nBlue cells containing a large single-digit number are the start bytes for a sequence of that many bytes. The unbolded hexadecimal code point number shown in the cell is the lowest character value encoded using that start byte. This value can be greater than the value which would be obtained by following the start byte with continuation bytes which are all 65 (hex 0x41), if this would result in an invalid overlong form.\n\nOrange cells with one dot are continuation bytes. The hexadecimal number shown after a \"+\" plus sign is the value of the 5 bits they add.\n\nRed cells indicate start bytes (for a sequence of that many bytes) which can never appear in properly encoded UTF-EBCDIC text, because any possible continuation would result in an invalid overlong form.

First, scientists like Wolfgang Kempelen started to build speech machines to produce the earliest synthetic speech sounds. This led to further work by Thomas Edison to record audio with dictation machines and play it back in corporate settings. In the 1950s-1960s there were primitive attempts to build automated speech recognition systems by Bell Labs, IBM, and others. However, it was not until the 1980s that Hidden Markov Models were used to recognize up to 1,000 words that speech recognition systems became relevant.\n\nAround 2011, Siri emerged on Apple iPhones as the first voice assistant accessible to consumers. This innovation led to a dramatic shift to building voice-first computing architectures. PS4 was released by Sony in North America in 2013 (70+ million devices), Amazon released the Amazon Echo in 2014 (30+ million devices), Microsoft released Cortana (2015 - 400 million Windows 10 users), Google released Google Assistant (2016 - 2 billion active monthly users on Android phones), and Apple released HomePod (2018 - 500,000 devices sold and 1 billion devices active with iOS/Siri). These shifts, along with advancements in cloud infrastructure (e.g. Amazon Web Services) and codecs, have solidified the voice computing field and made it widely relevant to the public at large.\n\nA voice computer is assembled hardware and software to process voice inputs.\n\nNote that voice computers do not necessarily need a screen, such as in the traditional Amazon Echo. In other embodiments, traditional laptop computers or mobile phones could be used as voice computers. Moreover, there has become increasingly more interfaces for voice computers with the advent of IoT-enabled devices, such as within cars or televisions.\n\nAs of September 2018, there are currently over 20,000 types of devices compatible with Amazon Alexa.\n\nVoice computing software can read/write, record, clean, encrypt/decrypt, playback, transcode, transcribe, compress, publish, featurize, model, and visualize voice files.\n\nHere are some popular software packages related to voice computing:\n\nVoice computing applications span many industries including voice assistants, healthcare, e-Commerce, finance, supply chain, agriculture, text-to-speech, security, marketing, customer support, recruiting, cloud computing, microphones, speakers, and podcasting. Voice technology is projected to grow at a CAGR of 19-25% by 2025, making it an attractive industry for startups and investors alike.\n\nIn the United States different states have varying telephone recording laws. In some states, it is legal to record a conversation with the consent of only one party, in others the consent of all parties is required.\n\nMoreover, COPPA is a significant law to protect minors on the internet. With an increasing number of minors interacting with voice computing devices (e.g. the Amazon Alexa), the Federal Trade Commission recently relaxed the COPAA rule so that kids can issue voice searches and commands.\n\nLastly, GDPR is a new European law that governs the right to be forgotten and many other clauses for EU citizens. GDPR also is clear that companies need to outline clear measures to obtain consent if audio recordings are made and define the purpose and scope as to how these recordings will be used (e.g. for training purposes). The bar for valid consent has been raised much higher under the GDPR. Consents must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous; tacit consent is no longer be enough.\n\nAll these things make it quite unclear how voice computing technology will be regulated into the future.\n\nThere are many research conferences that relate to voice computing. Some of these include:\n\nGoogle Assistant has roughly 2,000 actions as of January 2018.\n\nThere are over 50,000 Alexa skills worldwide as of September 2018.\n\nIn June 2017, Google released AudioSet, a large-scale collection of human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos. It contains 1,010,480 videos of human speech files, or 2,793.5 hours in total. It was released as part of the IEEE ICASSP 2017 Conference.\n\nIn November 2017, Mozilla Foundation released the Common Voice Project, a collection of speech files to help contribute to the larger open source machine learning community. The voicebank is currently 12GB in size, with more than 500 hours of English-language voice data that have been collected from 112 countries since the project's inception in June 2017. This dataset has already resulted in creative projects like the DeepSpeech model, an open source transcription model.\n\n"}

Based on an idea by Daniel Alston and implemented by Brion Vibber, the goal of the project which began as an outgrowth to Wikipedia Famous Quotations is to produce collaboratively a vast reference of quotations from prominent people, books, films, proverbs, etc. and to be as proper as possible in regard to the details of the quotations and also providing the appropriate human reference of the quotation. \nThough there are many online collections of quotations, Wikiquote is distinguished by being among the few that provide an opportunity for visitors to contribute and the very few which strive to provide exact sources for each quotation as well as corrections of misattributed quotations. Wikiquote pages are cross-linked to articles about the notable personalities on Wikipedia.\n\nInitially, the project was created solely in English; a later expansion to include additional languages was started in July 2004.\n\nThe article creation milestones are taken from WikiStats.\n\nAs of September 2016, there are a total of 89 language versions of Wikiquote with 31 of those containing over 1,000 articles. Sixty of the 89 versions of Wikiquote have over 100 articles. The ten largest Wikiquote language projects with over 5,000 articles each are listed here in descending order: \n\n"}
