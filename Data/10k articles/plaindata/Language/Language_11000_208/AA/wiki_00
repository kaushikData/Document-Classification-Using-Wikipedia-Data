The quantitation of how much time constitutes \"short\" and \"recent\" varies by disease and by context, but the core denotation of \"acute\" is always qualitatively in contrast with \"chronic\", which denotes long-lasting disease (for example, in acute leukaemia and chronic leukaemia). In addition, \"acute\" also often connotes two other meanings: sudden onset and severity, such as in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), where suddenness and severity are both established aspects of the meaning. It thus often connotes that the condition is fulminant (as in the AMI example), but not always (as in acute rhinitis, which is usually synonymous with the common cold). The one thing that acute MI and acute rhinitis have in common is that they are not chronic. They can happen again (as in recurrent pneumonia, that is, multiple acute pneumonia episodes), but they are not the same case ongoing for months or years (unlike chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is).\n\nA noncount sense of \"acute disease\" refers to the acute phase, that is, a short course, of any disease entity. For example, in an article on ulcerative enteritis in poultry, the author says, \"in acute disease there may be increased mortality without any obvious signs\", referring to the acute form or phase of ulcerative enteritis.\n\nNot all acute diseases or injuries are severe, and vice versa. For example, a mild stubbed toe is an acute injury. Similarly, many acute upper respiratory infections and acute gastroenteritis cases in adults are mild and usualln of several diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, acute leukaemia, acute myocardial infarction, and acute hepatitis. This is often to distinguish diseases from their chronic forms, such as chronic leukaemia, or to highlight the sudden onset of the disease, such as acute myocardial infarct.\n\nRelated terms include:\n\nAcute care is the early and specialist management of adult patients suffering from a wide range of medical conditions requiring urgent or emergency care usually within 48 hours of admission or referral from other specialties.\n\nAcute hospitals are those intended for short-term medical and/or surgical treatment and care.

{"id": "6867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6867", "title": "Context-free language", "text": "Context-free language\n\nIn formal language theory, a context-free language (CFL) is a language generated by a context-free grammar (CFG).\n\nContext-free languages have many applications in programming languages, in particular, most arithmetic expressions are generated by context-free grammars.\n\nDifferent context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. Intrinsic properties of the language can be distinguished from extrinsic properties of a particular grammar by comparing multiple grammars that describe the language.\n\nThe set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata, which makes these languages amenable to parsing. Further, for a given CFG, there is a direct way to produce a pushdown automaton for the grammar (and thereby the corresponding language), though going the other way (producing a grammar given an automaton) is not as direct.\n\nA model context-free language is formula_1, the language of all non-empty even-length strings, the entire first halves of which are 's, and the entire second halves of which are 's. is generated by the grammar formula_2.\nThis language is not regular.\nIt is accepted by the pushdown automaton formula_3 where formula_4 is defined as follows:\n\nUnambiguous CFLs are a proper subset of all CFLs: there are inherently ambiguous CFLs. An example of an inherently ambiguous CFL is the union of formula_6 with formula_7. This set is context-free, since the union of two context-free languages is always context-free. But there is no way to unambiguously parse strings in the (non-context-free) subset formula_8 which is the intersection of these two languages.\n\nThe language of all properly matched parentheses is generated by the grammar formula_9.\n\nThe context-free nature of the language makes it simple to parse with a pushdown automaton.\n\nDetermining an instance of the membership problem; i.e. given a string formula_10, determine whether formula_11 where formula_12 is the language generated by a given grammar formula_13; is also known as \"recognition\". Context-free recognition for Chomsky normal form grammars was shown by Leslie G. Valiant to be reducible to boolean matrix multiplication, thus inheriting its complexity upper bound of \"O\"(\"n\").\nConversely, Lillian Lee has shown \"O\"(\"n\") boolean matrix multiplication to be reducible to \"O\"(\"n\") CFG parsing, thus establishing some kind of lower bound for the latter.\n\nPractical uses of context-free languages require also to produce a derivation tree that exhibits the structure that the grammar associates with the given string. The process of producing this tree is called \"parsing\". Known parsers have a time complexity that is cubic in the size of the string that is parsed.\n\nFormally, the set of all context-free languages is identical to the set of languages accepted by pushdown automata (PDA). Parser algorithms for context-free languages include the CYK algorithm and Earley's Algorithm.\n\nA special subclass of context-free languages are the deterministic context-free languages which are defined as the set of languages accepted by a deterministic pushdown automaton and can be parsed by a LR(k) parser.\n\nSee also parsing expression grammar as an alternative approach to grammar and parser.\n\nContext-free languages are closed under the following operations. That is, if \"L\" and \"P\" are context-free languages, the following languages are context-free as well:\n\nThe context-free languages are not closed under intersection. This can be seen by taking the languages formula_22 and formula_23, which are both context-free. Their intersection is formula_24, which can be shown to be non-context-free by the pumping lemma for context-free languages. As a consequence, context-free languages cannot be closed under complementation, as for any languages \"A\" and \"B\", their intersection can be expressed by union and complement: formula_25. In particular, context-free language cannot be closed under difference, since complement can be expressed by difference: formula_26. \n\nHowever, if \"L\" is a context-free language and \"D\" is a regular language then both their intersection formula_27 and their difference formula_28 are context-free languages.\n\nIn formal language theory, questions about regular languages are usually decidable, but ones about context-free languages are often not. It is decidable whether such a language is finite, but not whether it contains every possible string, is regular, is unambiguous, or is equivalent to a language with a different grammar.\n\nThe following problems are undecidable for arbitrarily given context-free grammars A and B:\n\nThe following problems are \"decidable\" for arbitrary context-free languages:\n\nAccording to Hopcroft, Motwani, Ullman (2003), \nmany of the fundamental closure and (un)decidability properties of context-free languages were shown in the 1961 paper of Bar-Hillel, Perles, and Shamir\n\nThe set formula_8 is a context-sensitive language, but there does not exist a context-free grammar generating this language. So there exist context-sensitive languages which are not context-free. To prove that a given language is not context-free, one may employ the pumping lemma for context-free languages or a number of other methods, such as Ogden's lemma or Parikh's theorem.\n\n"}
{"id": "43440724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43440724", "title": "Counter-revolutionary", "text": "Counter-revolutionary\n\nA counter-revolutionary or anti-revolutionary is anyone who opposes a revolution, particularly those who act after a revolution to try to overturn or reverse it, in full or in part. The adjective, \"counter-revolutionary\", pertains to movements that would restore the state of affairs, or the principles, that prevailed during a prerevolutionary era.\n\nA counter-revolution can be positive or negative in its consequences; depending, in part, on the beneficent or pernicious character of the revolution that gets reversed, and the nature of those affected. For example, the transitory success of Agis and Cleomenes of ancient Sparta in restoring the constitution of Lycurgus was considered by Plutarch to be counter-revolutionary in a positive sense. During the French Revolution the Jacobins saw the Counter-revolution in the Vendée as distinctly negative, whilst it was strongly supported by the exiled Royalists, the Catholic Church, and the people of the provinces.\n\nIn some ways, the supporters of Jacobitism may be placed in this category. The Jacobites were supporters of the Stuart house's claim to the English throne since 1688. The Jacobites survive to this day in their support for the Stuart family's claim to the English throne.\n\nThe word \"counter-revolutionary\" originally referred to thinkers who opposed themselves to the 1789 French Revolution, such as Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Bonald or, later, Charles Maurras, the founder of the \"Action française\" monarchist movement. More recently, it has been used in France to describe political movements that reject the legacy of the 1789 Revolution, which historian René Rémond has referred to as \"légitimistes\". Thus, monarchist supporters of the \"Ancien Régime\" following the French Revolution were counter-revolutionaries, for example supporters of the Revolt in the Vendée and of the monarchies that put down the various Revolutions of 1848. The royalist legitimist counter-revolutionary French movement survives to this day, albeit marginally. It was active during the purported \"Révolution nationale\" enacted by Vichy France, though, which has been considered by René Rémond not as a fascist regime but as a counter-revolutionary regime, whose motto was \"Travail, Famille, Patrie\" (\"Work, Family, Fatherland\"), which replaced the Republican motto \"Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité\".\n\nAfter the French Revolution, anti-clerical policies and the execution of King Louis XVI led to the Revolt in the Vendee. This counter-revolution produced what is debated to be the first modern genocide. Monarchists and Catholics took up arms against the revolutionaries' French Republic in 1793 after the government asked that 300,000 Vendeans be conscripted into the Republican military. The Vendeans would also rise up against Napoleon's attempt to conscript them in 1815.\n\nMany historians have held that the rise and spread of Methodism in Great Britain prevented the development of a revolution there. In addition to preaching the Christian Gospel, John Wesley and his Methodist followers visited those imprisoned, as well as the poor and aged, building hospitals and dispensaries which provided free healthcare for the masses. The sociologist William H. Swatos stated that \"Methodist enthusiasm transformed men, summoning them to assert rational control over their own lives, while providing in its system of mutual discipline the psychological security necessary for autonomous conscience and liberal ideals to become internalized, an integrated part of the 'new men' ... regenerated by Wesleyan preaching.\" The practice of temperance among Methodists, as well as their rejection of gambling, allowed them to eliminate secondary poverty and accumulate capital. Individuals who attended Methodist chapels and Sunday schools \"took into industrial and political life the qualities and talents they had developed within Methodism and used them on behalf of the working classes in non-revolutionary ways.\" The spread of the Methodist Church in Great Britain, author and professor Michael Hill states, \"filled both a social \"and\" an ideological vacuum\" in English society, thus \"opening up the channels of social and ideological mobility ... which worked against the polarization of English society into rigid social classes.\" The historian Bernard Semmel argues that \"Methodism was an antirevolutionary movement that succeeded (to the extent that it did) because it was a revolution of a radically different kind\" that was capable of effecting social change on a large scale.\n\nIn Italy, after the conquer of the Napoleon's army in the late 18th century, there was a counter-revolution in all the French client republics. The most well-known was the Sanfedismo, reactionary movement led by the cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, which overthrew the Parthenopean Republic and allowed the Bourbon dynasty to return to the throne of the Kingdom of Naples. A resurgence of the phenomenon happened during the Napoleon's second Italian campaign in the early 19th century. Another example of counter-revolution was the peasants rebellion in Southern Italy after the national unification, fomented by the Bourbon government in exile and the Papal States. The revolt, labelled as brigandage, resulted in a bloody civil war that lasted almost ten years.\n\nThe supporters of Carlism during the 19th century to the present day are perhaps the oldest surviving counter-revolutionary group in Spain. Supporters uphold the legitimist view of royal succession, as well as regional autonomy under the monarchy, tradition and Catholicism. The Carlist cause began with the First Carlist War in 1833 and continues to the present.\nThe White Army and its supporters who tried to defeat the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution, as well as the German politicians, police, soldiers and Freikorps who crushed the German Revolution of 1918–1919, were also counter-revolutionaries. General Victoriano Huerta, and later the Felicistas, attempted to thwart the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Mexican Catholics took up arms against the Mexican Federal Government in what became known as the Cristero War. The President of Mexico, Plutarco Elias Calles, was elected in 1924. Calles began carrying out anti-Catholic policies which caused peaceful resistance from Catholics in 1926. The counter-revolution began as a movement of peaceful resistance against the anti-clerical laws. In the Summer of 1926, fighting broke out. The fighters known as Cristeros fought the government due to its suppression of the Church, jailing and execution of priests, formation of a nationalist schismatic church, state atheism, Socialism, Freemasonry and other harsh anti-Catholic policies.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War was in some respects, a counter-revolution. Supporters of Carlism, monarchy, and nationalism (see Falange) joined forces against the (Second) Spanish Republic in 1936. The counter-revolutionaries saw the Spanish Constitution of 1931 as a revolutionary document that defied Spanish culture, tradition and religion. On the Republican side, the acts of the Communist Party of Spain against the rural collectives can also be considered counter-revolutionary.\n\nMore recently, the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion into Cuba was conducted by counter-revolutionaries who hoped to overthrow the revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. In the 1980s, the \"Contra-Revolución\" rebels fighting to overthrow the revolutionary Sandinista government in Nicaragua. In fact, the Contras received their name precisely because they were counter-revolutionaries.\n\nThe Black Eagles, the AUC, and other paramilitary movements of Colombia can also be seen as counter-revolutionary. These right-wing groups are opposition to the FARC, and other left-wing guerrilla movements.\n\nSome counter-revolutionaries are former revolutionaries who supported the initial overthrow of the previous regime, but came to differ with those who ultimately came to power after the revolution. For example, some of the Contras originally fought with the Sandinistas to overthrow Anastasio Somoza, and some of those who oppose Castro also opposed Batista.\n\nPlinio Correa de Oliveira has by far expanded on the idea of Revolution and Counter-Revolution.\n\nThe anti-communist Kuomintang party in China used the term \"counter-revolutionary\" to disparage the communists and other opponents of its regime. Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang party leader, was the chief user of this term.\n\nThe Kuomintang had several influences left upon its ideology by revolutionary thinking. The Kuomintang, and Chiang Kai-shek used the words \"feudal\" and \"counter-revolutionary\" as synonyms for evil, and backwardness, and proudly proclaimed themselves to be revolutionary. Chiang called the warlords feudalists, and called for feudalism and counter-revolutionaries to be stamped out by the Kuomintang. Chiang showed extreme rage when he was called a warlord, because of its negative, feudal connotations.\n\nChiang also crushed and dominated the merchants of Shanghai in 1927, seizing loans from them, with the threats of death or exile. Rich merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs were arrested by Chiang, who accused them of being \"counter-revolutionary\", and Chiang held them until they gave money to the Kuomintang. Chiang's arrests targeted rich millionaires, accusing them of communism and counter-revolutionary activities. Chiang also enforced an anti-Japanese boycott, sending his agents to sack the shops of those who sold Japanese made items and fining them. He also disregarded the internationally protected International Settlement, putting cages on its borders in which he threatened to place the merchants. The Kuomintang's alliance with the Green Gang allowed it to ignore the borders of the foreign concessions.\n\nA similar term also existed in the People's Republic of China, which includes charges such collaborating with foreign forces and inciting revolts against the government. According to Article 28 of the Chinese constitution, \"The state maintains public order and suppresses treasonable and other counter-revolutionary activities; It penalizes actions that endanger public security and disrupt the socialist economy and other criminal activities, and punishes and reforms criminals.\"\n\nThe term received wide usage during the Cultural Revolution, in which thousands of intellectuals and government officials were denounced as \"counter-revolutionaries\" by the Red Guards. Following the end of the Cultural Revolution, the term was also used to label Lin Biao and the Gang of Four.\n\nThe word \"counter-revolutionary\" is often used interchangeably with \"reactionary\"; however, some reactionary people use the term \"counter-revolutionary\" to describe their opponents, even if those opponents were advocates of a revolution. In general, the word \"reactionary\" is used to describe those who oppose a more long-term trend of social change, while \"counter-revolutionaries\" are those who oppose a very recent and sudden change.\n\nThe clerics who took power following the Iranian Revolution became \"counter-revolutionaries\"; after the revolution the Marxists were driven out of power by the mullahs. Thousands of political prisoners who opposed the Islamist regime were killed especially during the 1988 Massacre of Iranian Prisoners.\n\nSometimes it is unclear who represents the revolution and who represents the counter-revolution. In Hungary, the 1956 uprising was condemned as a \"counter-revolution\" by the ruling Communist authorities (who claimed to be revolutionary themselves). However, thirty years later, the events of 1956 were more widely known as a \"revolution\".\n\n\n"}

At the time, it was most frequently used to describe public skepticism about the Lyndon B. Johnson administration's statements and policies on the Vietnam War. It was used in journalism as a euphemism for recognized lies told to the public by politicians. Today, it is used more generally to describe almost any \"gap\" between an actual situation and what politicians and government agencies say about it.\n\nThe term \"credibility gap\" came against a background of the use of the term \"missile gap\", which the Oxford English Dictionary lists as first being used by then-Senator John F. Kennedy on 14 August 1958, when he stated: \"Our Nation could have afforded, and can afford now, the steps necessary to close the missile gap.\" \"Doomsday gap\" and \"mineshaft gap\" were the imagined post-apocalyptic continuations of this paranoia in the 1964 Cold War satire Dr. Strangelove.\n\nThe term \"credibility gap\" was widely in use as early as 1963, according to \"Timetables of History\". Prior to its association with the Vietnam War, in December 1962, at the annual meeting of the U.S. Inter-American Council, Senator Kenneth B. Keating (R-N.Y.) praised President John F. Kennedy's prompt action in the Cuban Missile Crisis, but he said there was an urgent need for the United States to plug the \"credibility gap\" in U.S. policy on Cuba. It was popularized in 1966 by J. William Fulbright, a Democratic Senator from Arkansas, when he could not get a straight answer from President Johnson's Administration regarding the war in Vietnam.\n\n\"Credibility gap\" was first used in association with the Vietnam War in the \"New York Herald Tribune\" in March 1965, to describe then-president Lyndon Johnson's handling of the escalation of American involvement in the war. A number of events—particularly the surprise Tet Offensive, and later the 1971 release of the Pentagon Papers—helped to confirm public suspicion that there was a significant \"gap\" between the administration's declarations of controlled military and political resolution, and the reality. These were viewed as examples of Johnson's and later Richard Nixon's duplicity. Throughout the war, Johnson worked with his officials to ensure that his public addresses would only disclose bare details of the war to the American public. During the war the country grew more and more aware of the credibility gap especially after Johnson's speech at Johns Hopkins University in April 1965. An example of public opinion appeared in \"The New York Times\" concerning the war. \"The time has come to call a spade a bloody shovel. This country is in an undeclared and unexplained war in Vietnam. Our masters have a lot of long and fancy names for it, like escalation and retaliation, but it is a war just the same.\" - James Reston.\n\nThe advent of the presence of television journalists allowed by the military to report and photograph events of the war within hours or days of their actual occurrence in an uncensored manner drove the discrepancy widely referred to as \"the credibility gap.\"\n\nAfter the Vietnam War, the term \"credibility gap\" came to be used by political opponents in cases where an actual, perceived or implied discrepancy existed between a politician's public pronouncements and the actual, perceived or implied reality. For example, in the 1970s the term was applied to Nixon's own handling of the Vietnam War and subsequently to the discrepancy between evidence of Richard Nixon's complicity in the Watergate break-in and his repeated claims of innocence.\n\nSince 2017, the has been used to describe the Trump administration, particularly in relation to the use of what White House Counsel Kellyanne Conway called alternative facts.\n"}
{"id": "1486561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1486561", "title": "Cross-cultural", "text": "Cross-cultural\n\nCross-cultural may refer to\n\nBy the 1970s, the field of cross-cultural communication (also known as intercultural communication) developed as a prominent application of the cross-cultural paradigm, in response to the pressures of globalization which produced a demand for cross-cultural awareness training in various commercial sectors.\n\nCultural communication differences can be identified by 8 different criteria: \n\nThe appearance of the term \"cross-cultural\" in the titles of a number of college readers and writing textbooks beginning in the late 1980s can be attributed to a convergence of academic multiculturalism and the pedagogical movement known as Writing Across the Curriculum, which gave educators in the social sciences greater influence in composition pedagogy. Popular examples included \"Ourselves Among Others: Cross-Cultural Readings for Writers\" (1988), edited by Carol J. Verburg, and \"Guidelines: A Cross Cultural Reading Writing Text\" (1990), ed. Ruth Spack.\n\nCross-cultural studies is an adaptation of the term \"cross-cultural\" to describe a branch of literary and cultural studies dealing with works or writers associated with more than one culture. Practitioners of cross-cultural studies often use the term \"cross-culturalism\" to describe discourses involving cultural interactivity, or to promote (or disparage) various forms of cultural interactivity.\n\nCross-culturalism is nearly synonymous with transculturation, a term coined by Cuban writer Fernando Ortiz in the 1940s to describe processes of cultural hybridity in Latin America. However, there are certain differences of emphasis reflecting the social science derivation of \"cross-culturalism\".\n\nThe term \"cross-culturalism\" became prevalent in cultural studies in the late 1980s and 1990s. An early proponent of the term was the Guyanese writer Wilson Harris, who wrote in \"The Womb of Space\" (1983), that \"cultural heterogeneity or cross-cultural capacity\" gives an \"evolutionary thrust\" to the imagination.\n\nAnthropology exerted a strong influence on the development of cross-culturalism in literary and cultural studies. French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss was a key figure in the development of structuralism and its successor, post-structuralism. Cross-influences between anthropology and literary/cultural studies in the 1980s were evident in works like James Clifford and George Marcus's collection, \"Writing Culture: the Poetics and Politics of Ethnography\" (1986). Harvard anthropologist Clifford Geertz was cited as an influence on literary critics like Stephen Greenblatt, while other literary/cultural scholars turned to works by Victor Turner and Mary Douglas.\n\nLike multiculturalism, cross-culturalism is sometimes construed as ideological, in that it advocates values such as those associated with transculturation, transnationalism, cosmopolitanism, interculturalism, and globalism. Nevertheless, cross-culturalism is a fundamentally neutral term, in that favorable portrayal of other cultures or the processes of cultural mixing are not essential to the categorization of a work or writer as cross-cultural.\n\nCross-culturalism is distinct from multiculturalism. Whereas multiculturalism deals with cultural diversity within a particular nation or social group, cross-culturalism is concerned with exchange beyond the boundaries of the nation or cultural group.\n\nCross-culturalism in literary and cultural studies is a useful rubric for works, writers and artists that do not fit within a single cultural tradition. To the extent that cultures are national, the cross-cultural may be considered as overlapping the transnational. The cross-cultural can also be said to incorporate the colonial and the postcolonial, since colonialism is by definition a form of cross-culturalism. Travel literature also makes up a substantial component of cross-cultural literature. Of the various terms, \"cross-culturalism\" is the most inclusive, since it is free of transnationalism's dependence on the nation-state and colonialism/postcolonialism's restriction to colonized or formerly-colonized regions. This inclusiveness leads to certain definitional ambiguity (albeit one derived from the term culture itself). In practice, \"cross-cultural\" is usually applied only to situations involving significant cultural divergence. Thus, the term is not usually applied in cases involving crossing between European nations, or between Europe and the United States. However, there is no clear reason why, for example, Alexis de Tocqueville's \"Democracy in America\" or even Woody Allen's \"Annie Hall\" (in which the protagonist experiences culture shock after traveling to Los Angeles from New York City) could not be considered cross-cultural works.\n\nAlthough disagreement over what constitutes a \"significant\" cultural divergence creates difficulties of categorization, \"cross-cultural\" is nevertheless useful in identifying writers, artists, works, etc., who may otherwise tend to fall between the cracks of various national cultures.\n\nThe term \"cross-cultural\" emerged in the social sciences in the 1930s, largely as a result of the \"Cross-Cultural Survey\" undertaken by George Peter Murdock, a Yale anthropologist. Initially referring to comparative studies based on statistical compilations of cultural data, the term gradually acquired a secondary sense of cultural interactivity. The comparative sense is implied in phrases such as \"a cross-cultural perspective,\" \"cross-cultural differences,\" \"a cross-cultural study of...\" and so forth, while the interactive sense may be found in works like \"Attitudes and Adjustment in Cross-Cultural Contact: Recent Studies of Foreign Students\", a 1956 issue of \"The Journal of Social Issues\". \n\nUsage of \"cross-cultural\" was for many decades restricted mainly to the social sciences. Among the more prominent examples are the International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP), established in 1972 \"to further the study of the role of cultural factors in shaping human behavior,\" and its associated \"Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology\", which aims to provide an interdisciplinary discussion of the effects of cultural differences.\n\n\nNote that in the early 21st century the term \"intercultural theatre\" is preferred to \"cross-cultural theatre.\" \n\n\n\nCross-cultural narrative forms may be described in terms of common characteristics or tropes shared by cross-cultural writers, artists, etc. Examples include primitivism, exoticism, as well as culturally specific forms such as Orientalism, Japonisme.\n\nCross-cultural narratives tend to incorporate elements such as:\n\nMusic has long been a central medium for cross-cultural exchange. The cross-cultural study of music is referred to as ethnomusicology.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1543426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1543426", "title": "Double closing", "text": "Double closing\n\nA double closing is the simultaneous purchase and sale of a real estate property involving three parties: the original seller, an investor (middleman), and the final buyer.\n\nThe underlying reasons for having a double closing vary. The most pressing and usual reason is to allow the middleman to use the purchasers funds to acquire the property from the original seller. Another common reason for a double closing is to conceal the identity of the purchaser or seller.\n\nTypically, a real estate investor first enters into a contract to purchase a property and then subsequently (before closing the purchase) enters into a contract to sell the property (hopefully for a higher price). The investor then utilizes a double closing to close both transactions at approximately the same time.\n\nThe mechanics of a double closing vary, depending on who the buyer and seller are, who is providing the financing, and who is conducting the closing. In the simplest form of double closing, the purchaser would pay the purchase monies to the middleman and they would complete a settlement statement (HUD-1) for their transaction. The purchaser would have to wait while the middleman uses most of the purchase monies to purchase the property from the seller. The seller and middleman would also complete a separate settlement statement for their transaction. The middleman would then instruct the seller to deed the property directly to the purchaser.\n\nTo keep the purchaser and seller separate,the closing may be conducted in two different rooms or at two different times or locations. Success is more likely if the closing agent is friendly and accommodating.\n\nTo simplify the transaction, the middleman may make one settlement statement directly between the purchaser and seller and take his profit as a line item on the settlement statement. This line item is usually on the purchaser's side of the statement as an assignment fee. This may create a problem for the middleman, as assignment fees may be taxed at a different rate than short-term capital gains.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, most sale contracts stipulate that the seller may pay encumbrances out of the proceeds of the sale. The fact that the original seller still owns the property is definitely an encumbrance. Also, contracts may be assignable, thus allowing the middleman to have the right to assign his purchase contract to the purchaser for a fee.\n"}

Dvapara in Sanskrit literally means \"two ahead\", that is, something in the third place. The Dvapara Yuga follows the Treta Yuga and precedes the Kali Yuga. According to the Puranas, this yuga ended at the moment when Krishna returned to his eternal abode of Vaikuntha. According to the Bhagavata Purana, the Dvapara Yuga lasts 864,000 years.\n\nThere are only two pillars of religion during the Dvapara Yuga: compassion and truthfulness. Vishnu assumes the colour yellow and the Vedas are categorized into four parts: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda. During these times, the Brahmins are knowledgeable of two or three of these but rarely have studied all the four Vedas thoroughly. Accordingly, because of this categorization, different actions and activities come into existence.\n\nAll people in the Dvapara Yuga are desirous of achievement of the scriptural dharma that is prescribed to each class, valiant, courageous and competitive by nature and are engaged only in penance and charity. They are kingly and pleasure-seeking. In this era, the divine intellect ceases to exist, and it is therefore seldom that anyone is wholly truthful. As a result of this life of deceit, people are plagued by ailments, diseases and various types of desires. After suffering from these ailments, people realize their misdeeds and perform penance. Some also organize Yagya for material benefits as well as for divinity.\n\nIn this Yuga, the Brahmanas are involved in Yagya, self-study and teaching activities. They attain celestial bliss by engaging in penance, religion, control of senses, and restraint.\n\nThe duties of Kshatriyas are the protection of their subjects. In this era, they are humble and perform their duties by controlling their senses. The Kshatriyas honestly execute all policies of law and order without being angry or cruel. They are devoid of injustice towards the ordinary citizens and consequently attain bliss.\n\nThe king avails the advice of the learned scholars and accordingly maintains law and order in his empire. The king who is addicted to vices will definitely end up defeated. One or two or all from Sāma, Dāna, Danda, Bheda and Upeksha is/are brought into use and help attain the desired. Kings are diligent in maintaining public decorum and order.\n\nA few of the kings, however, surreptitiously plan a conspiracy along with the scholars. Strong people execute work where execution of policies is involved. The king appoints priests, etc. to perform religious activities, economists and ministers to perform monetary activities, impotents to take care of women, and cruel men to execute heinous activities.\n\nThere are two kshatriya dynasties, namely 'Surya Vansha' and 'Chandra Vansha'.\n\nVaishyas are mostly landowners and merchants. The duties of Vaishyas are trade and agriculture. Vaishyas attain higher planes through charity and hospitality. Krishna, eighth Avatar of Vishnu was brought up in a Vaishya family though he was a born Yadav.\n\nThe duty of Sudras is to perform tasks that demand highly physical work. vedas say everyone is a born shudra and with their deeds they can become a kshatriya, brahman or vaishya. For political reasons shudras had difficulty going up the ranks unless they were extraordinary. Vidura, the famous Prime Minister of Hastinapura was born in the Sudra community and attained the status of a Brahmin due to his wisdom, righteousness and learning.\nJathi and varna was a horizontal, flexible, dynamic system that built a reasonable harmonious society compared to other civilizations in the world.\n\nIn 1894, Swami Sri Yukteswar, with his book The Holy Science, broke from Hindu tradition in stating that the earth is not in the age of Kali Yuga, but has advanced to Dwapara Yuga. His proof was based on a new perspective of the precession of the equinoxes, correcting a problem of \"interpretation\" of the ancient texts.\n\nIn Namco's Soul series, Kilik, the wielder of the Kali Yuga staff, also possess the mirror sash by the same name. In the end of the battle against Inferno, he uses the mirror to extinguish the flames. In Soulcalibur II, Soulcalibur III, and Soulcalibur IV he wears a necklace that includes a piece of the Dvapara Yuga used as a pendant for rituals.\n\n"}

{"id": "9596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9596", "title": "Ellipsis", "text": "Ellipsis\n\nAn ellipsis (plural ellipses; from the , , 'omission' or 'falling short') is a series of dots (typically three, such as \"…\") that usually indicates an intentional omission of a word, sentence, or whole section from a text without altering its original meaning.\n\nThe ellipsis is also called a suspension point, points of ellipsis, periods of ellipsis, or (colloquially) \"dot-dot-dot\".\n\nDepending on their context and placement in a sentence, ellipses can indicate an unfinished thought, a leading statement, a slight pause, an echoing voice, or a nervous or awkward silence. Aposiopesis is the use of an ellipsis to trail off into silence—for example: \"But I thought he was …\" When placed at the beginning or end of a sentence, the ellipsis can also inspire a feeling of melancholy or longing.\n\nThe most common form of an ellipsis is a row of three periods or full points (...) or a precomposed triple-dot glyph (…). The usage of the em dash (—) can overlap the usage of the ellipsis, especially in dialogue. Style guides often have their own rules governing the use of ellipses. For example, \"The Chicago Manual of Style\" (\"Chicago\" style) recommends that an ellipsis be formed by typing three periods, each with a space on both sides ( . . . ), while the \"Associated Press Stylebook\" (\"AP\" style) puts the dots together, but retains a space before and after the group.\n\nWhether an ellipsis at the end of a sentence needs a fourth dot to finish the sentence is a matter of debate; \"Chicago\" advises it, as does the \"Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association\" (APA style), while some other style guides do not; the \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary\" and related works treat this style as optional, saying that it \"may\" be used. More commonly, a normal full stop (period) terminates the sentence, then a three-dot ellipsis is used to indicate one or more subsequent elided sentences before continuing a longer quotation. \"Business Insider\" magazine suggests this style, and it is also used in many academic journals. Even the \"Associated Press Stylebook\" – notably hostile to punctuation that journalists may consider optional and removable to save newsprint column width – favors this approach. It is consistent in intent if not exact form with the agreement among those in favor of a fused four-dot ellipsis that the first of them is a full stop terminating the sentence and the other three are the ellipsis.\n\nIn her book on the ellipsis, \"Ellipsis in English Literature: Signs of Omission\" (Cambridge University Press, 2015), Anne Toner suggests that the first use of the punctuation in the English language dates to a 1588 translation of Terence's \"Andria\", by Maurice Kyffin. In this case, however, the ellipsis consists not of dots but of short dashes. \"Subpuncting\" of medieval manuscripts also denotes omitted meaning and may be related.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, an ellipsis was often used when a writer intentionally omitted a specific proper noun, such as a location: \"Jan was born on . . . Street in Warsaw.\"\n\nAs commonly used, this juxtaposition of characters is referred to as \"dots of ellipsis\" in the English language.\n\nOccasionally, it would be used in pulp fiction and other works of early 20th-century fiction to denote expletives that would otherwise have been censored.\n\nAn ellipsis may also imply an unstated alternative indicated by context. For example, when Sue says \"I never drink wine . . . \", the implication is that she does drink something elsesuch as vodka.\n\nIn reported speech, the ellipsis can be used to represent an intentional silence.\n\nIn poetry, an ellipsis is used as a thought-pause or line break at the caesura or this is used to highlight sarcasm or make the reader think about the last points in the poem.\n\nIn news reporting, often associated with brackets, it is used to indicate that a quotation has been condensed for space, brevity or relevance.\n\nHerb Caen, Pulitzer-prize-winning columnist for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", became famous for his \"three-dot journalism\".\n\n\"The Chicago Manual of Style\" suggests the use of an ellipsis for any omitted word, phrase, line, or paragraph from within but not at the end of a quoted passage. There are two commonly used methods of using ellipses: one uses three dots for any omission, while the second one makes a distinction between omissions within a sentence (using three dots: . . .) and omissions between sentences (using a period and a space followed by three dots: . ...).\n\nThe Modern Language Association (MLA) used to indicate that an ellipsis must include spaces before and after each dot in all uses. If an ellipsis is meant to represent an omission, square brackets must surround the ellipsis to make it clear that there was no pause in the original quote: [ . . . ]. Currently, the MLA has removed the requirement of brackets in its style handbooks. However, some maintain that the use of brackets is still correct because it clears confusion.\n\nThe MLA now indicates that a three-dot, spaced ellipsis ( . . . ) should be used for removing material from within one sentence within a quote. When crossing sentences (when the omitted text contains a period, so that omitting the end of a sentence counts), a four-dot, spaced (except for before the first dot) ellipsis (. . . . ) should be used. When ellipsis points are used in the original text, ellipsis points that are not in the original text should be distinguished by enclosing them in square brackets (e.g. \"text […] text\").\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the ellipsis should be used to condense quotations. It is less commonly used to indicate a pause in speech or an unfinished thought or to separate items in material such as show business gossip. The stylebook indicates that if the shortened sentence before the mark can stand as a sentence, it should do so, with an ellipsis placed after the period or other ending punctuation. When material is omitted at the end of a paragraph and also immediately following it, an ellipsis goes both at the end of that paragraph and at the beginning of the next, according to this style.\n\nAccording to Robert Bringhurst's \"Elements of Typographic Style\", the details of typesetting ellipses depend on the character and size of the font being set and the typographer's preference. Bringhurst writes that a full space between each dot is \"another Victorian eccentricity. In most contexts, the Chicago ellipsis is much too wide\"—he recommends using flush dots, or \"thin\"-spaced dots (up to one-fifth of an em), or the prefabricated ellipsis character (. Bringhurst suggests that normally an ellipsis should be spaced fore-and-aft to separate it from the text, but when it combines with other punctuation, the leading space disappears and the other punctuation follows. This is the usual practice in typesetting. He provides the following examples:\n\nIn legal writing in the United States, Rule 5.3 in the \"Bluebook\" citation guide governs the use of ellipses and requires a space before the first dot and between the two subsequent dots. If an ellipsis ends the sentence, then there are three dots, each separated by a space, followed by the final punctuation (e.g. Hah . . . ?). In some legal writing, an ellipsis is written as three asterisks (*** or * * *) to make it obvious that text has been omitted.\n(...) is also used for awkward silence.\n\n\"The Oxford Style Guide\" recommends setting the ellipsis as a single character (…) or as a series of three (narrow) spaced dots (. . .), and surrounding it by spaces. If there is an ellipsis at the end of an incomplete sentence, the final full stop is omitted. However, it is retained if the following ellipsis represents an omission between two complete sentences.\n\nContrary to \"The Oxford Style Guide\", the \"University of Oxford Style Guide\" demands an ellipsis not to be surrounded by spaces, except when it stands for a pause; then, a space has to be set after the ellipsis (but not before). An ellipsis is never preceded or followed by a full stop.\n\nWhen applied in Polish language syntax, the ellipsis is called , which means \"multidot\". The word \"wielokropek\" distinguishes the ellipsis of Polish syntax from that of mathematical notation, in which it is known as an .\n\nWhen an ellipsis replaces a fragment omitted from a quotation, the ellipsis is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. An unbracketed ellipsis indicates an interruption or pause in speech.\n\nThe syntactical rules for ellipses are standardized by the 1983 Polska Norma document PN-83/P-55366, (\"Rules for setting texts in the Polish Language\").\n\nThe combination \"ellipsis+period\" is replaced by the ellipsis. The combinations \"ellipsis+exclamation mark\" and \"ellipsis+question mark\" are written in this way: !.. ?..\n\nThe most common character corresponding to an ellipsis is called \"3\"-ten rīdā (\"\"3\"-dot leaders\", ). 2-ten rīdā exists as a character, but it is used less commonly. In writing, the ellipsis consists usually of six dots (two \"3\"-ten rīdā characters, ). Three dots (one \"3\"-ten rīdā character) may be used where space is limited, such as in a header. However, variations in the number of dots exist. In horizontally written text the dots are commonly vertically centered within the text height (between the baseline and the ascent line), as in the standard Japanese Windows fonts; in vertically written text the dots are always centered horizontally. As the Japanese word for dot is pronounced \", the dots are colloquially called \" (, akin to the English \"dot dot dot\").\n\nIn manga, the ellipsis by itself represents speechlessness, or a \"pregnant pause\". Depending on the context, this could be anything from an admission of guilt to an expression of being dumbfounded at another person's words or actions. As a device, the \"ten-ten-ten\" is intended to focus the reader on a character while allowing the character to not speak any dialogue. This conveys to the reader a focus of the narrative \"camera\" on the silent subject, implying an expectation of some motion or action. It is not unheard of to see inanimate objects \"speaking\" the ellipsis.\n\nIn Chinese, the ellipsis is six dots (in two groups of three dots, occupying the same horizontal or vertical space as two characters) (i.e. ……).\n\nIn Spanish, ellipsis is commonly used as a substitute of \"et cetera\" at the end of unfinished lists. So it means \"and so forth\" or \"and other things\".\n\nOther use is the suspension of a part of a text, or a paragraph, or a phrase or a part of a word because it is obvious, or unnecessary, or implied. For instance, sometimes the ellipsis is used to avoid the complete use of expletives.\n\nWhen the ellipsis is placed alone into a parenthesis (...) or—less often—between brackets […], which is what happens usually within a text transcription, it means the original text had more contents on the same position but are not useful to our target in the transcription. When the suppressed text is at the beginning or at the end of a text, the ellipsis does not need to be placed in a parenthesis.\n\nIn French, the ellipsis is commonly used at the end of lists to represent \"et cetera\". In French typography, the ellipsis is written close up to the preceding word but has a space after it, for example: \"comme ça… pas comme ceci\". If, exceptionally, it begins a sentence, there is a space before and after, for example: \"Lui ? … vaut rien, je crois… \".\n\nHowever, any omitted word, phrase or line at the end of a quoted passage would be indicated like this: [...] (space before and after the square brackets but not inside), for example: \" … à Paris, Nice, Nantes, Toulouse […] \".\n\nIn German, the ellipsis in general is surrounded by spaces, if it stands for one or more omitted words. On the other side there is no space between a letter or (part of) a word and an ellipsis, if it stands for one or more omitted letters, that should stick to the written letter or letters.\n\nExample for both cases, using German style: \"The first el…is stands for omitted letters, the second … for an omitted word.\"\n\nIf the ellipsis is at the end of a sentence, the final full stop is omitted.\n\nExample: \"I think that …\"\nIn computer menu functions or buttons, an appended ellipsis means that on selection another dialog will follow, where the user can or must make a choice. If the ellipsis is missing, the function is already executed on selection.\n\nAn ellipsis is also often used in mathematics to mean \"and so forth\". In a list, between commas, or following a comma, a normal ellipsis is used, as in:\n\nor to mean an infinite list, as:\n\nTo indicate the omission of values in a repeated operation, an ellipsis raised to the center of the line is used between two operation symbols or following the last operation symbol, as in:\n\nSometimes, e.g. in Russian mathematical texts, normal, non-raised, ellipses are used even in repeated summations.\n\nThe latter formula means the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to 100. However, it is not a formally defined mathematical symbol. Repeated summations or products may similarly be denoted using capital sigma and capital pi notation, respectively:\n\nNormally dots should be used only where the pattern to be followed is clear, the exception being to show the indefinite continuation of an irrational number such as:\n\nSometimes, it is useful to display a formula compactly, for example:\n\nAnother example is the set of zeros of the cosine function:\n\nThere are many related uses of the ellipsis in set notation.\n\nThe diagonal and vertical forms of the ellipsis are particularly useful for showing missing terms in matrices, such as the size-\"n\" identity matrix:\n\nThe use of ellipses in mathematical proofs is often discouraged because of the potential for ambiguity. For this reason, and because the ellipsis supports no systematic rules for symbolic calculation, in recent years some authors have recommended avoiding its use in mathematics altogether.\n\nA two- or three-dot ellipsis is used as an operator in some programming languages. The precise meaning varies by language, but it generally involves something dealing with multiple items. One of its most common uses is in defining ranges or sequences. This is used in many languages, including Pascal, Modula, Oberon, Ada, Haskell, Perl, Python, Ruby, Bash shell and F#. It is also used to indicate so called variadic functions in the C, C++ and Java languages. \"See Ellipsis (programming operator)\".\n\nThe CSS codice_1 property can be set to codice_2, which cuts off text with an ellipsis when it overflows the content area.\n\nThe ellipsis is a non-verbal cue that is often used in computer-mediated interactions, in particular in synchronous genres, such as chat. The reason behind its popularity is the fact that it allows people to indicate in writing several functions:\n\nAlthough an ellipsis is technically complete with three periods (...), its rise in popularity as a \"trailing-off\" or \"silence\" indicator, particularly in mid-20th-century comic strip and comic book prose writing, has led to expanded uses online. Today, extended ellipsis anywhere from two to dozens of periods have become common constructions in Internet chat rooms and text messages. The extent of repetition in itself might serve as an additional contextualization or paralinguistic cue, to \"extend the lexical meaning of the words, add character to the sentences, and allow fine-tuning and personalisation of the message\".\n\nIn computing, several ellipsis characters have been codified, depending on the system used.\n\nIn the Unicode standard, there are the following characters:\nIn Windows, it can be inserted with .\n\nIn OS X, it can be inserted with (on an English language keyboard).\n\nIn some Linux distributions, it can be inserted with , or alternatively sequence can be used.\n\nIn Chinese and sometimes in Japanese, ellipsis characters are made by entering two consecutive \"horizontal ellipsis\" (U+2026). In vertical texts, the application should rotate the symbol accordingly.\n\nUnicode recognizes a series of three period characters (U+002E) as compatibility equivalent (though not canonical) to the horizontal ellipsis character.\n\nIn HTML, the horizontal ellipsis character may be represented by the entity reference codice_3 (since HTML 4.0), and the vertical ellipsis character by the entity reference codice_4 (since HTML 5.0). Alternatively, in HTML, XML, and SGML, a numeric character reference such as codice_5 or codice_6 can be used.\n\nIn the TeX typesetting system, the following types of ellipsis are available:\nIn LaTeX, note that the reverse orientation of codice_7 can be achieved with codice_8 provided by the codice_9 package: codice_10 yields .\n\nWith the codice_11 package from AMS-LaTeX, more specific ellipses are provided for math mode.\nThe horizontal ellipsis character also appears in the following older character maps:\n\nNote that ISO/IEC 8859 encoding series provides no code point for ellipsis.\n\nAs with all characters, especially those outside the ASCII range, the author, sender and receiver of an encoded ellipsis must be in agreement upon what bytes are being used to represent the character. Naive text processing software may improperly assume that a particular encoding is being used, resulting in mojibake.\n\nThe Chicago Style Q&A recommends to avoid the use of … (U+2026) character in manuscripts and to place three periods plus two nonbreaking spaces (. . .) instead, so that an editor, publisher, or designer can replace them later.\n\nIn Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), the ellipsis is used as an extension marker to indicate the possibility of type extensions in future revisions of a protocol specification. In a type constraint expression like codice_12 an ellipsis is used to separate the extension root from extension additions. The definition of type A in version 1 system of the form codice_13 and the definition of type A in version 2 system of the form codice_12 constitute an extension series of the same type A in different versions of the same specification. The ellipsis can also be used in compound type definitions to separate the set of fields belonging to the extension root from the set of fields constituting extension additions. Here is an example: codice_15 \n\n\n"}

He completed his spiritual evolve in 5 years and got caliphate. Then he went to Hijaz in 1292/1875.\n\nArriving Istanbul\n\nReturning from Hajj, and having lost his Shaikh, he came to Istanbul. He stayed at “Besiraga Dargah” as a guest in Salkimsogut. After lovers and visitors of him increased a lot, he left there and settled the muezzin room of a mosque in Bayezid-Parmakkapi. He taught the “Khafiz Divan” and “Luccet-ul Asrar” of Mawlana Jamii in Fatih Mosque. Many people of knowledge and wisdom continued these lessons. Hodja Master Yekta and some other scholars recognized him in these lessons and became affiliated with him.\n\nIn a short time, his reputation encircled Istanbul and the son-in-law of the Sultan, Darwish Pashazade Khalid Pasha invited him to the Palace and learned Arabic and religious sciences from him. M. Es’ad Erbili was appointed to the member of Majles-I Mashayih by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. He used to go to Majles during the meetings, to the Fatih Mosque for lessons and sometimes used to go to the Palace.\n\nIn the meantime, he moved his house to one of the rooms which are over the gates of Bayezid Mosuqe. Moreover, he appealed for a “tekke”. At that time, “Kadirî Dargah” was free. Because this place is of a Kadirî Dargah, the Sheikh should have a Kadirî diploma (permit). Master M. Esad was appointed to this dargah after having diploma from one of the grandchilds of Abd el-Kader Gîlānî, named Abdulhameed er-Refqanî. There he first made Kadirî ritual and afterwards he made “Hatm-I Hacegan”\n\nIn 1914, Esad Erbili was appointed the chairman of the Assembly of Shaykhs (The Council of Islamic Teachers, or \"Meclis-i Meşâyıh\") in Istanbul and was so until its closure in 1915\n\nAs part of the Atatürk's Reforms, the tekke in Istanbul was closed.

He defined the Holy Roman Empire (962–1806) as the \"First Reich\", and the German Empire (1871–1918) as the \"Second Reich\", while the \"Third Reich\" was an ideal state including all German peoples, including Austria. In the modern context the term refers to Nazi Germany. It was used by the Nazis to legitimize their regime as a successor state to the retroactively-renamed First and Second Reichs.\n\nThe term \"Fourth Reich\" has been used in a variety of different ways. Neo-Nazis have used it to describe their envisioned revival of an ethnically pure state, mostly in reference to, but not limited to, Nazi Germany. Others have used the term derogatorily, such as conspiracy theorists like Max Spiers, Dr. Joseph P. Farrell, Peter Levenda, and Jim Marrs who have used it to refer to what they perceive as a covert continuation of Nazi ideals.\n\nIn terms of neo-Nazism, the Fourth Reich is envisioned as featuring Aryan supremacy, anti-Semitism, \"Lebensraum\", aggressive militarism and totalitarianism. Upon the establishment of the Fourth Reich, German neo-Nazis propose that Germany should acquire nuclear weapons and use the threat of their use as a form of nuclear blackmail to re-expand to Germany's former boundaries as of 1937.\n\nBased on pamphlets published by David Myatt in the early 1990s, many neo-Nazis came to believe that the rise of the Fourth Reich in Germany would pave the way for the establishment of the \"Western Imperium\", a pan-Aryan world empire encompassing all land populated by predominantly European-descended peoples (i.e., Europe, Russia, Anglo-America, Australia, South America's Southern Cone, New Zealand, South Africa).\n\nSome commentators in various parts of Europe have used the term \"Fourth Reich\" to point at the influence that they believe Germany exerts within the European Union. \n\nThis narrative has gained particular traction in the United Kingdom in the run up to Brexit and the current negotiations. \n\n\n"}

Little is known about him other than that he maintained a journal throughout the siege, which he afterwards published.\n\nBalbi's is the best-known eyewitness account of the siege (there is at least one other, in the form of a long poem by the knight Hipolito Sans), and all subsequent histories rely heavily upon it, including that of Giacomo Bosio, the official historian of the Knights of St. John, whose massive account first appeared in 1588.\n\nBalbi's journal, apparently with some revisions after the fact, was first published in Spain in 1567. A second revised and extended edition was published in 1568. The first English translation appeared in 1961 by Henry A. Balbi, who might have been a distant descendent of the author. Another, less literal translation with some cuts was made by Ernle Bradford in 1965.\n\n"}

{"id": "13702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13702", "title": "Hebrew numerals", "text": "Hebrew numerals\n\nThe system of Hebrew numerals is a quasi-decimal alphabetic numeral system using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.\nThe system was adapted from that of the Greek numerals in the late 2nd century BCE.\n\nThe current numeral system is also known as the \"Hebrew alphabetic numerals\" to contrast with earlier systems of writing numerals used in classical antiquity. These systems were inherited from usage in the Aramaic and Phoenician scripts, attested from c. 800 BC in the so-called Samaria ostraca and sometimes known as \"Hebrew-Aramaic numerals\", ultimately derived from the Egyptian Hieratic numerals.\n\nThe Greek system was adopted in Hellenistic Judaism and had been in use in Greece since about the 5th century BC.\nIn this system, there is no notation for zero, and the numeric values for individual letters are added together. Each unit (1, 2, ..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, ..., 90) a separate letter, and the first four hundreds (100, 200, 300, 400) a separate letter. The later hundreds (500, 600, 700, 800 and 900) are represented by the sum of two or three letters representing the first four hundreds. To represent numbers from 1,000 to 999,999, the same letters are reused to serve as thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. Gematria (Jewish numerology) uses these transformations extensively.\n\nIn Israel today, the decimal system of Arabic numerals (ex. 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) is used in almost all cases (money, age, date on the civil calendar). The Hebrew numerals are used only in special cases, such as when using the Hebrew calendar, or numbering a list (similar to a, b, c, d, etc.), much as Roman numerals are used in the West.\n\nThe Hebrew language has names for common numbers that range from zero to one million. Letters of the Hebrew alphabet are used to represent numbers in a few traditional contexts, for example in calendars. In other situations Arabic numerals are used. Cardinal and ordinal numbers must agree in gender with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. telephone numbers), the feminine form is used. For ordinal numbers greater than ten the cardinal is used and numbers above the value 20 have no gender.\n\nNote: For ordinal numbers greater than 10, cardinal numbers are used instead.\n\nNote: For numbers greater than 20, gender does not apply. Officially, numbers greater than million were represented by the long scale; However, since January 21st, 2013, the modified short scale (under which the long scale milliard is substituted for the strict short scale billion), which was already the colloquial standard, became official.\n\nCardinal and ordinal numbers must agree in gender (masculine or feminine; mixed groups are treated as masculine) with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. a telephone number or a house number in a street address), the feminine form is used. Ordinal numbers must also agree in number and definite status like other adjectives. The cardinal number precedes the noun (e.g., \"shlosha yeladim\"), except for the number one which succeeds it (e.g., \"yeled echad\"). The number two is special: \"shnayim\" (m.) and \"shtayim\" (f.) become \"shney\" (m.) and \"shtey\" (f.) when followed by the noun they count. For ordinal numbers (numbers indicating position) greater than ten the cardinal is used.\n\nThe Hebrew numeric system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total. For example, 177 is represented as קעז which (from right to left) corresponds to 100 + 70 + 7 = 177.\n\nMathematically, this type of system requires 27 letters (1-9, 10-90, 100-900). In practice the last letter, \"tav\" (which has the value 400) is used in combination with itself and/or other letters from \"kof\" (100) onwards, to generate numbers from 500 and above. Alternatively, the 22-letter Hebrew numeral set is sometimes extended to 27 by using 5 \"sofit\" (final) forms of the Hebrew letters.\n\nBy convention, the numbers 15 and 16 are represented as ט״ו (9 + 6) and ט״ז (9 + 7), respectively, in order to refrain from using the two-letter combinations י-ה (10 + 5) and י-ו (10 + 6), which are alternate written forms for the Name of God in everyday writing. In the calendar, this manifests every full moon, since all Hebrew months start on a new moon (see for example: Tu BiShvat).\n\nCombinations which would spell out words with negative connotations are sometimes avoided by switching the order of the letters. For instance, 744 which should be written as תשמ״ד (meaning \"you/it will be destroyed\") might instead be written as תשד״מ or תמש״ד (meaning \"end to demon\").\n\nThe Hebrew numeral system has sometimes been extended to include the five final letter forms—ך (500‎), ם (600‎), ן (700‎), ף (800‎) and ץ (900‎)—which are then used to indicate the numbers from 500 to 900.\n\nThe ordinary forms for 500 to 900 are: ת״ק (500‎), ת״ר (600‎), ת״ש (700‎), ת״ת (800‎) and תת״ק (900‎).\n\nGershayim (U+05F4 in Unicode, and resembling a double quote mark) (sometimes erroneously referred to as \"merkha'ot\", which is Hebrew for double quote) are inserted before (to the right of) the last (leftmost) letter to indicate that the sequence of letters represents a number rather than a word. This is used in the case where a number is represented by two or more Hebrew numerals (\"e.g.,\" 28 → כ״ח).\n\nSimilarly, a single Geresh (U+05F3 in Unicode, and resembling a single quote mark) is appended after (to the left of) a single letter to indicate that the letter represents a number rather than a (one-letter) word. This is used in the case where a number is represented by a single Hebrew numeral (\"e.g.,\" 100 → ק׳).\n\nNote that Geresh and Gershayim merely indicate \"\"not a (normal) word.\" Context usually determines whether they indicate a number or something else (such as \"abbreviation\"\").\n\nAn alternative method found in old manuscripts and still found on modern-day tombstones is to put a dot above each letter of the number.\n\nIn print, Arabic numerals are employed in Modern Hebrew for most purposes. Hebrew numerals are used nowadays primarily for writing the days and years of the Hebrew calendar; for references to traditional Jewish texts (particularly for Biblical chapter and verse and for Talmudic folios); for bulleted or numbered lists (similar to \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"etc.\", in English); and in numerology (gematria).\n\nThousands are counted separately, and the thousands count precedes the rest of the number (to the \"right\", since Hebrew is read from right to left). There are no special marks to signify that the “count” is starting over with thousands, which can theoretically lead to ambiguity, although a single quote mark is sometimes used after the letter. When specifying years of the Hebrew calendar in the present millennium, writers usually omit the thousands (which is presently 5 []), but if they do not this is accepted to mean 5 * 1000, with no ambiguity. The current Israeli coinage includes the thousands.\n\n“Monday, 15 Adar 5764” (where 5764 = 5(×1000) + 400 + 300 + 60 + 4, and 15 = 9 + 6):\n\n“Thursday, 3 Nisan 5767” (where 5767 = 5(×1000) + 400 + 300 + 60 + 7):\n\nTo see how \"today's\" date in the Hebrew calendar is written, see, for example, Hebcal date converter.\n\n5780 (2019–20) = תש״פ\n\n5779 (2018–19) = תשע״ט\n\n5772 (2011–12) = תשע״ב\n\n5771 (2010–11) = תשע״א\n\n5770 (2009–10) = תש״ע\n\n5769 (2008–09) = תשס״ט\n\n5761 (2000–01) = תשס״א\n\n5760 (1999–00) = תש״ס\n\nThe Abjad numerals are equivalent to the Hebrew numerals up to 400. The Greek numerals differ from the Hebrew ones from 90 upwards because in the Greek alphabet there is no equivalent for \"Tsadi\" (צ).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5318433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5318433", "title": "Itche Goldberg", "text": "Itche Goldberg\n\nItche Goldberg (Yiddish: איטשע גאָלדבערג; March 22, 1904 – December 27, 2006) was a Polish-born Yiddish language writer of children's books, poet, librettist, educator, literary critic, camp director, publisher, fundraiser, essayist, literary editor, Yiddish language and culture scholar, and left-wing political activist. He devoted his life to the preservation of the Yiddish language and secular Yiddish culture.\n\nGoldberg was born in Opatow, Poland, and moved to Warsaw in 1914, attending Poznanski Teachers Seminary. In 1920 he moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, studying philosophy, German and political science at McMaster University. While in Toronto, he taught Yiddish at The Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring school; it was in Toronto that his leftist/pro-communist sympathies matured. \n\nHe moved to New York City in the late 1920s, and continued teaching Yiddish there as well as in Philadelphia, but left the socialist Workmen's Circle schools for the more radical \"Arbeter Ordn Shuln\". \n\nThe education schism, with Goldberg and many schools leaving the \"Arbeter Ring\" to form the \"Ordn\" network, was part of an exceedingly vituperative break within the leftist Yiddish community between the communists and socialists (who the communists sometimes called \"social fascists\").\n\nPassing on the Yiddish tradition to future generations was a mainstay of his life. From 1937 to 1951 he was editor of \"Yunvarg\", a children's magazine. He wrote many children's stories, and his book, \"Yiddish Stories for Young People\", is still being used at Workmen's Circle schools. From 1970 to 1985 he was professor of Yiddish language and literature at Queens College (C.U.N.Y.). He may be currently best known as editor from 1964 to 2004 of the longest running journal of Yiddish literature, \"Yidishe Kultur\". The frequency of publication went down during this period, as Yiddish writers and speakers gradually died off. The final edition was published in 2004. Yet, he clung to the notion that Yiddish can still be a living language.\nHe saw in the Yiddish/Jewish culture of Eastern Europe humanistic and progressive values. He felt that these were important, not religious ritual. He even criticized Nobel Prize–winning author I.B. Singer for not portraying these ideals in his writings.\n\nGoldberg, a secular Jew, had been closely associated with left-wing causes for many years. There were probably several threads to his attraction to a radical cause. His close associates in Toronto were Communists, including his brother-in-law, who shared his revolutionary world view of social justice. \n\nHe saw the Soviet Union as the salvation for the Jewish national and social problems. Also, he described an embedded rebelliousness in those doubly alienated, \"suffering and benefiting from 'rejection [and persecution] by the Gentiles, but also their own rejection of the narrowness of the rabbi and merchant dominated shtetl life'\".\n\nShortly after moving to New York City, he became director of the \"Arbeter Ordn Shuln\", and helped set up a nationwide network of these schools, reaching a peak number of 140. Best described as supplemental schools, they aimed at promoting Yiddish identity, as well as inculcating the concepts of class consciousness and social justice. Goldberg saw two function of the \"shuln\"; \"to revolutionize Yiddish education and to separate religion from education for the first time in Jewish history; and on the other hand to ensure that progressive secularism is carried forward from generation to generation.\" For decades beginning in the 1920s, including two as director, he was associated with Camp Kinderland, known as a \"red diaper baby\" camp. \n\nFrom 1937-51, he was national school and cultural director of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order, a branch of the pro-Communist International Workers Order. At its peak after World War II the JPFO had 50,000 members. \n\nWhen the IWO was about to be liquidated during the Red Scare in 1954 by the Department of Insurance of New York State (IWO was a fiscally sound fraternal benefit insurance company with close 200,000 members in its peak years, 1946–47), Itche withdrew the Yiddish shules from the JPFO in order to preserve them, creating the independent Service Bureau for Jewish Education so that the schools could continue to function. In the anti-left atmosphere of the period, this effort was only partially successful.\n\nOver time he made a transition to democratic socialism, eventually seeing the Soviet Union as an anti-model. By the 1950s his enthusiasm for the Soviet Union had completely evaporated, particularly after the Soviets executed Jewish writers in 1952. \n\nBeginning in 1957 \"Yiddishe Kultur\" co-sponsored an annual public remembrance of the 12 August 1952 murders. \n\nNevertheless, he remained a central figure in the Jewish left for decades. Goldberg wrote and lectured frequently on the proud Jewish content he found in the works of such Soviet Yiddish writers as Perets Markish, Dovid Hofshteyn, and Dovid Bergelson. The Yidisher Kultur Farband (YKUF) in whose leadership Goldberg served for many years published numerous works by these authors when other Yiddish publishers in the west rejected them as outside of the Yiddish canon.\n\nIn honor of his 100th birthday the Jewish People's Philharmonic Chorus had a concert which included a musical adaptation of I.L. Peretz's \"\"Oyb Nit Nokh Hekher\", with libretto by Itche Goldberg. In another 100th tribute, Jerrold Nadler honored him in the United States House of Representatives by saying: \"Mir shatsn op ayer vunderlekhe arbet l'toyves der yidisher kultur vos hot baraikhert dem gontsn Yiddishn yishev\".\" (English translation ``We honor your wonderful work for the benefit of Yiddish culture which enriches all of Yiddish heritage.\")\n\nHe died at age 102. His last book was \"Essayen Tsvey\" (\"Essays Two\") in 2004, when he was 100 years. In honor of this publication, a commemoration of his life was held on July 25, 2006, sponsored by YIVO and League for Yiddish. A Josh Wiletsky documentary was made of his life at age 101, \"Itche Goldberg, A Century Of Yiddish Letters\", and was shown at this event.\n\n\"The split in the Socialist ranks was very powerful, and harmful and it was about attitudes to the Soviet Union\".\n\n“Never, never in history, did we produce so many poets and so much poetry in such a short period of time, barely one century. It is rare to find so much creativity in the entire history of our involvement with other languages. Look at the Tanakh—you have any number of splendors put together by various writers over the course of centuries. But here, they weren't given any time. Time was so short for all of us. And we're speaking only of poetry. But the prose that was produced! ... It was a time of exceptional, history-making creativity. And if we don’t understand this, we will perhaps not understand how to inherit or what to inherit.” (Speaking of Yiddish literature in first half of 20th century)\n\n“Just because I'm secular doesn't mean I'm antireligious.”\n\n\"The need to keep Yiddish alive in one shape or another is very basic. And after what we went through -- the loss not only of six million but also Eastern Europe -- do you allow a culture to drift away and stop existing?\"\n\n\"You can't possibly see a future Jewish life with the disappearance of a 1,000-year-old language and with it a 1,000-year-old culture. Somehow it has to be there.\"\n\n\"There was no question about our Jewishness or Jewish consciousness and the Jewish consciousness led us very naturally to the Soviet Union. Here was Romania, anti-Semitic; here was Poland, which was anti-Semitic. Suddenly we saw how Jewish culture was developing in the Soviet Union. It was really breathtaking. You had the feeling that both the national problem was solved and the social problem was solved. This was no small thing. It was overpowering and we were young.\"\n\n\"We're dealing with a language that is about 1,000 years old and a literature that is 600 or 700 years old. What developed was an extraordinary and profound modern literature which would become the equivalent of French and German literature.\"\n\n\"I only have two dreams. One dream is that someone will knock on the door and I will open it and they give me a check for $150,000 for the magazine. Second dream is that someone knocks at the door and I open it up and he gives me a corned beef sandwich. Those are my only two dreams. I'm not asking for much. Really, I'm not. And I think they're both reachable.\"\n\n\"They were killed simply because they were Jewish intellectuals. Their Jewishness was the reason. They were all stamped as spies.\" (RE: 1952 Stalin victims)\n\nAt age 100: \"The question of where we go from here is on my mind a lot. What’s happened to socialism? What is the future of Yiddishism? When I came, at age 21, into the Workmen’s Circle shule in Toronto, I had so much eagerness, energy, and faith in socialism and in Yiddishism. Now I have insecurity. But I am used to insecurity. For over forty years I have published Yidishe Kultur without ever being able to secure its existence!\"\n\n"}

As indicated by the title, the book, Burke's 16th published work, consists of “many of Burke's essays which have appeared in widely diverse periodicals” and has thus been regarded as one of the most significant resources for studying and comprehending Burke’s ideas.\n\n\"Language as Symbolic Action\" is divided into three parts: (1) Five Summarizing Essays (2) Particular Works and Authors and (3) Further Essays on Symbolism in General.\n\nThe first of Burke’s five essays is the “Definition of man” which defines man as \n\n. . .the symbol-using (symbol-making, symbol-misusing) animal, inventor of the negative (or moralized by the negative), separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy (or moved by the sense of order), and rotten with perfection. \n\nThe next chapter “Poetics in Particular, Language in General” returns to a discussion of perfection continued from the previous chapter. Burke summarizes this chapter by stating: \n\nThe poetic motive does indeed come to a head in the principle of perfection . . . But the principle of perfection should not be viewed in too simple a sense. We should also use the expression ironically . . . the motive of perfection may extend to areas far beyond the confines of poetry and poetics. \n\nOsborn explains this concept further: “. . . a truly rigorous attempt to account for a single work on the grounds of poetics alone should force recognition that it is necessary to go beyond poetics-in-particular to language-in-general. . .” Perfection, according to Burke and similar scholars, is a motive that exists both in literature and beyond, as an underlying human desire that drives much symbolic action.\n\nThe third and often-referenced chapter “Terministic Screens” makes use of many key terms of Burke’s “dramatistic” approach to literary and rhetorical criticism. Burke begins the chapter by explaining the “scientistic” and the “dramatistic.” “‘A scientistic approach begins with questions of naming, or definition’(44). A ‘dramatistic’ approach stresses ‘language as an aspect of ‘action,’ that is, symbolic action’(44).” Burke explains that, through the concept of terministic screens,\n“any nomenclature necessarily directs the attention into some channels rather than others.” This can be obvious, such as how different academic subjects direct the attention, or more subtle. Burke illustrates the latter point with an example of how photos of the same objects using different color filters reflected and deflected his attention in different ways, depending on the filter (45). \n\nTerministic screens is significant to the process of rhetorical criticism, as well as understanding rhetoric, because terministic screens are a conduit to understanding reality.\n\nThe 11 chapters comprising Part II engage in rhetorical criticism of, among others, Shakespeare’s \"Antony and Cleopatra\", the \"Oresteia\", \"Faust\", and William Carlos Williams.\n\nPart III consists of eight chapters. One of the more significant of these is chapter six, entitled “Medium as Message.” Burke takes one of his peers, Marshall McLuhan, to task for focusing too much on the media rather than the symbolic resources of language. \n\nBurke’s main criticism of McLuhan stems from his most memorable slogan and the undue emphasis put on medium. “If the medium is the message, obviously the important thing is not what somebody says in a given medium, but what medium he uses, regardless of what he says. . . The medium is the message. Hence, down with content analysis” (413). \n\nBurke continues the discussion on the relative importance of medium to message by acknowledging the relationship as significant and stating that certain content can be better delivered by or suited to a specific medium.\n\nBurke’s ideas, through these significant essays, have had widespread influence. Burke scholar Nelson J. Smith III offered this review: “Much of what our current generation of rhetoricians accomplishes will be drawn from the preliminary and pioneer investigations into the sociology of ideology by Kenneth Burke.” Frederick J. Hoffman also writes: “[Burke’s] range and scope are truly remarkable. If there are predecessors and contemporaries in this respect, they are probably Remy de Gourmont. . .and Eric Auerbach. . . His fate is that of a man some years ahead of his time.” The range of critical ideas and practices included in \"Language as Symbolic Action\" help scholars explore this breadth.\n"}

An example common to many languages in the term for a very remote ancestor, \"great-great-...-grandfather\", where the prefix \"great-\" may be repeated any number of times.\n\nSystematic names of chemical compounds can run to hundreds of thousands of characters in length. The rules of creation of such names are commonly defined by international bodies, therefore they formally belong to many languages. The longest recognized systematic name is for the protein titin, at 189,819 letters. While lexicographers regard generic names of chemical compounds as \"verbal formulae\" rather than words, for its sheer length the systematic name for titin is often included in longest-word lists.\n\nLongest word candidates may be judged by their acceptance in major dictionaries such as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" or in record-keeping publications like \"Guinness World Records\", and by the frequency of their use in ordinary language.\n\nAfrikaans, as it is a daughter language of the Dutch language, is capable of forming compounds of potentially limitless length in the same way as in the Dutch language.

It refers to a 19th-century political movement that opposed the disestablishment of the Church of England as the state church of England.\n\nFloccinaucinihilipilification, at 29 letters and meaning the act of estimating something as being worth so little as to be practically valueless, or the habit of doing so, is the longest non-technical, coined word in Oxford Dictionaries of the English language.\n\nThe longest official Esperanto roots are 12 letters long, shown here with the added substantive \"-o\" ending:\n\nSince Esperanto allows word compounding, there are no limits on how long a word can theoretically become. A relatively short example is the 46-letter \", which is an (accusative and plural) adjective that means \"about to begin to become the leader of a contemptible palaeontology conservatory\". (Such clusters are not considered good style, but are permissible under the rules of Esperanto grammar.)\n\nThree examples of long words that have been in everyday use in the Finnish language are which means \"three phase kilowatt hour meter\" (31 letters), (\"a public utility of a municipal federation for provision of basic services\", 34 letters) and \"airplane jet turbine engine auxiliary mechanic non-commissioned officer student\" (61 letters), an actual military term, although one which has been deprecated. If conjugated forms are allowed, even longer real words can be made. Allowing derivatives and clitics allows the already lengthy word to grow even longer, although the usability of the word starts to degrade. Because Finnish uses free forming of composite words, new words can even be formed during a conversation. One can add nouns after each other without breaking grammar rules.\n\nIf one allows artificial constructs as well as using clitics and conjugated forms, one can create even longer words: such as (102 letters), which was created by Artturi Kannisto.\n\nThe longest non-compound (a single stem with prefixes and suffixes) Finnish word recognised by the Guinness Book of Records is (see also Agglutination#Extremes), based on the stem (reason, sanity), and it means: I wonder if – even with his/her quality of not having been made unsystematized\n\nIn German, whole numbers (smaller than 1 million) can be expressed as single words, which makes (777,777) a 65 letter word. In combination with or, as an inflected noun, , all numbers can be written as one word. A 79 letter word, , was named the longest published word in the German language by the 1972 Guinness Book of World Records, but longer words are possible. The word was the name of a prewar Viennese club for subordinate officials of the headquarters of the electrical division of the company named the , which operated steam boats on the Danube river.\n\nThe longest word that is not created artificially as a longest-word record seems to be at 63 letters. The word means \"law delegating beef label monitoring\" but as of 2013, it was removed from the books because European Union regulations have changed and that particular law became obsolete, leading to news reports that Germany \"had lost its longest word\".\n\nIn December 2016 the 51-letter word \"\" (\"deferral of the second iteration of the federal presidential run-off election\") was elected the Austrian Word of the Year 2016. The jury called it a \"descriptive word\" which \"in terms of its content as well as its length, is a symbol and an ironic form of commentary for the political events of this year, characterized by the very long campaign for the presidential election, the challenges of the voting process, and its reiteration.\"\n\nIn his comedy \"Assemblywomen\" (c. 392 BC), Aristophanes coined the 173-letter word , a fictional food dish consisting of a combination of fish and other meat. The word is cited as the longest ancient Greek word ever written.\nA modern Greek word of 22 letters is () (gen. (), 25 letters) meaning \"electroencephalogram\".\n\n', with 44 letters is one example of a long word in the Hungarian language and means something like \"for your [plural] continued behaviour as if you could not be desecrated\". It is already morphed, since Hungarian is an agglutinative language. The language does not have a \"longest word\" due to its agglutinating nature. It is always possible to construct a longer one with enough creativity. For example, ' (119 letters), which means: \"About your investigations of the upgradeability of the manifestation of the syndrome of the neurosis about the need to decide which is the world record of the most complex longest word.\"\n\nThe longest dictionary form word is the word in use (although it is constructed from the word: \"szent\" meaning: \"saint\"), \"\", with 25 characters, and means \"something that cannot be desecrated\".\n\nIcelandic has the ability to form compounds of arbitrary length by stringing together genitives (), so no single words of maximal length exist in the language. However, and are sometimes cited as particularly long words; the latter has 64 letters and means \"a keychain ring for the outdoor key of road workers shed in a moor called Vaðlaheiði\".\n\nAnalysis of a corpus of contemporary Icelandic texts by Uwe Quasthoff, Sabine Fiedler and Erla Hallsteinsdóttir identified (\"of the International Transport Workers' Federation\"; 37 letters) and (\"of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries' Organization\"; 45 letters) as the longest unhyphenated and hyphenated words.\n\nThe longest word occurring at least twice in the University of Leipzig \"isl-is_web_2015\" corpus is (110 letters).\n\nThe longest word in Italian is traditionally \", which is a 26-letter-long adverb. It is formed by subsequent addition of postfixes to the original root:\n\nThe word is never used in every-day language, but in jokes. Nevertheless, it is an official part of Italian language; it was coined in 1677 by poet Francesco Moneti:\n\nThe word technically violates Italian grammar rules, the correct form being \"precipitevolissimamente\", which is three letters and one syllable shorter. The poet coined the new word to have 11 syllables in the second verse.\n\nOther words can be created with a similar (and grammatically correct) mechanism starting from a longer root, winding up with a longer word. Some examples are:\n\nThe longest accepted neologism is \" (30 letters)..\n\nOther long words are:\n\nThere is some disagreement about what is the longest word in the Korean language. The longest word appearing in the \"Standard Korean Dictionary\" published by the National Institute of the Korean Language is (); Revised Romanization: \"\", which is a kind of ceramic bowl from the Goryeo dynasty; that word is 17 syllable blocks long, and contains a total of 46 hangul letters. The term (), a phonetic transcription of \"nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\", has a larger number of syllable blocks (19) but a smaller number of letters (41), and also might not qualify as a single word due to the spaces.\n\nIn proper nouns, many Korean monarchs have long posthumous names built from many different Sino-Korean nouns describing their positive characteristics, for example Sunjo of Joseon, whose full posthumous name is the 77-syllable-block ().\n\nThe longest Lithuanian word is 40 letters long:\n\nThe Māori-language 85-letter place name \"\" is the longest place name in English-speaking countries and second longest in the world, according to \"Wises New Zealand Guide\" and \"The New Zealand Herald\".\n\nMongolian is an agglutinative language. Words can get longer by adding suffixes. So, the longest suffixed word in Mongolian is \" () which is 26 letters long. Here is a table showing, with translations, which suffixes are added.\n\nThe longest word in Ojibwe language is \" (66 letters), meaning \"blueberry pie\". This literally translates to \"blueberry cooked to jellied preserve that lies in layers in which the face is covered in bread\".\n\nVery long Polish words can be created as adjectives from numerals and nouns. For example, \"\", 54 letters, is the genitive singular form of an adjective meaning roughly \"of nine-hundred and ninety-nine nationalities\". Similar words are rather artificial compounds, constructed within allowed grammar rules, but are seldom used in spoken language, although they are not nonsense words. It is possible to make even longer words in this way, for example:\n\n\"\" (176 letters, meaning \"of 999,999,999,999 years old\").\n\nOne of the longest common words is 31-letter ' – the dative singular form of \"ninety-and-some years old one\". Another common long word is ' (23 letters), \"a 50 groszy coin\".\n\nTheoretically, it is possible to create Russian words of unlimited length, for example: (\"\", great great great...grandfather).\n\nMost likely one of the longest, originally Russian words is ('), which contains 35 letters. \"[It] is an adjective in the bureaucratic language of the 19th century meaning a very polite form of addressing clerks, something like Your Excellency, Your Highness, Your Majesty all together\"(Guinness World Records 2003). Its dative singular form, (', with 36 letters) can be an example of excessively official vocabulary of the 19th century. \n\nNumeral compounds can be long as well, such as (\"\"), which is an adjective containing 46 letters, meaning \"1889-micrometer\".\n\nSanskrit allows word compounding of arbitrary length. Nouns and verbs can be expressed in a sentence. \n\nThe longest sentence ever used in Sanskrit literature is (in Devanagari):\n\nIn IAST transliteration:\n\nfrom the Varadāmbikā Pariṇaya Campū by Tirumalāmbā, composed of 195 Sanskrit letters (428 letters in the roman transliteration, dashes excluded), thus making it the longest word ever to appear in worldwide literature.\n\nEach hyphen separates every individual word this word is composed of.\n\nThe approximate meaning of this word is:\n\nTraditionally, the word \" (31 letters) is considered as the longest Slovak word, but there are some longer artificial words. Most of them are compound adjectives in dative, instrumental or other grammatical case and derived from the iterative or frequentative verbal form or the ability adjective form (like -able).\nArtificial words, lexically valid but never used in language:\n\nThe longest word in Spanish is \" (inflammation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, 30 letters). Runners-up are \" ([proceeding in a manner that is] contrary to the constitution) and \" (specialists that do electrical scans on brains (electroencephalographists)), both 23 letters.\n\nThe word \"\" is usually considered the longest word \"in general use\". This word can be made even longer by the addition of the absolute superlative suffix, rendering \"anticonstitucionalísimamente\" (i.e.: \"very strongly against the constitution\"). Some dictionaries (but not the RAE dictionary) removed its root word (\"anticonstitucional\") in 2005, causing comments about it not \"being a valid word anymore\" and suggesting the use of \"inconstitucional\" as a replacement.\n\n' (28 letters) is the longest word in Svenska Akademiens Ordlista. It means \"capital gains taxation\", and is usually shortened to ' (same meaning).\nHowever, Swedish grammar makes it possible to create arbitrarily long words. One such word is \"\" (94 letters) which means: \"[belonging to] The manager of the depot for the supply of uniforms to the personnel of the track cleaners' union of the tramway company\".\n\nTagalog—an agglutinative language—can make long words by adding on affixes, suffixes, and other root words with a connector. \n\nThe longest published word in the language is “pinakanakakapagngitngitngitngitang-pagsisinungasinungalingan,” with 59 letters. This compound word means “to keep making up a lie that causes the most extreme anger while pretending you are not.”\n\nTurkish, as an agglutinative language, carries the potential for words of arbitrary length.\n\n\"\", at 70 letters, has been cited as the longest Turkish word. It was used in a contrived story designed to use this word. The word means \"As if you would be from those we can not easily/quickly make a maker of unsuccessful ones\" and its usage was illustrated as follows: \n\" ' ' ' ' ' \"' \"\n\"We are in a teachers' training school that has evil purposes. The teachers who are being educated in that school are being taught how to make unsuccessful ones from students. So, one by one, teachers are being educated as makers of unsuccessful ones. However, one of those teachers refuses to be maker of unsuccessful ones, in other words, to be made a maker of unsuccessful ones; he talks about and criticizes the school's stand on the issue. The headmaster who thinks every teacher can be made easily/quickly into a maker of unsuccessful ones gets angry. He invites the teacher to his room and says \"You are talking as if you were one of those we can not easily/quickly turn into a maker of unsuccessful ones, right?\"\nOther well-known very long Turkish words are: \n\nVietnamese is an isolating language, which naturally limits the length of a morpheme. The longest, at seven letters, is , which means \"inclined\" or \"to lean\". This is the longest word that can be written without a space. However, not all words in Vietnamese are single morphemes. Indeed, can be reduplicated as .\n\nThe written language abounds with compound words in which each constituent word is delimited by spaces, just like any freestanding word. Moreover, the grammar lacks inflection to mark parts of speech, and prepositions are often optional. Therefore, the boundary between a word and a phrase is poorly defined. Examples of this ambiguity include:\n\n\nUnlike locally coined compound words, compound words in Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary are less ambiguous, because of the use of premodifiers (as in English) as opposed to the native postmodifiers. Long Sino-Vietnamese words include (\"encyclopedia\") and (\"hydrodynamics\").\n\nLoanwords and pronunciation respellings from other languages can also result in long words. For example, \"consortium\" is (12 letters), and \"Indonesia\" may be left as-is or spelled (13 counting hyphens). The \"Encyclopedic Dictionary of Vietnam\" systematically respells foreign names, introducing long names into an official Vietnamese lexicon:\n\n\nLong initialisms in Vietnamese include:\n\n\nIn modern Vietnamese, compound words can be identified fairly easily within title cased text: a morpheme that begins with a capital letter followed by one or more morphemes that begin with a lowercase letter. For example, (\"socialism\") is capitalized as one component within .\n\n, a railway station on the island of Anglesey in Wales, is the longest place name in the Welsh language. At 51 letters in the Welsh alphabet (the digraphs \"ll\" and \"ch\" are each collated as single letters) the name can be translated as \"St Mary's church in the hollow of the white hazel near to the rapid whirlpool and the church of St Tysilio of the red cave\". However, it was artificially contrived in the 1860s as a publicity stunt, to give the station the longest name of any railway station in the United Kingdom.\n\nLong words are comparatively rare in Welsh. Candidates for long words other than proper nouns include the following (the digraph \"dd\" is also treated as a single letter, as is \"ng\" in many instances including in the last word below):\n\n"}

{"id": "562958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=562958", "title": "Medical sign", "text": "Medical sign\n\nA medical sign is an objective indication of some medical fact or characteristic that may be detected by a patient or anyone, especially a physician, before or during a physical examination of a patient. For example, whereas a tingling paresthesia is a symptom (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), erythema is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic.\n\nSome signs may have no meaning to the patient, and may even go unnoticed, but may be meaningful and significant to the healthcare provider in assisting diagnosis.\n\nExamples of signs include elevated blood pressure, a clubbing of the ends of fingers (which may be a sign of lung disease, or many other things), a staggering gait (human) and arcus senilis of the eyes.\n\nThe term \"sign\" is not to be confused with the term \"indication\", which in medicine denotes a valid reason for using some treatment.\n\nThe art of interpreting clinical signs was originally called \"semiotics\" (a term now used for the study of sign communication in general) in English. This term, then written \"semeiotics\" (derived from the Greek adjective σημειωτικός: \"semeiotikos\", \"to do with signs\"), was first used in English in 1670 by Henry Stubbes (1631–1676), to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs:\n\nSigns are different from symptoms, the \"subjective\" experiences, such as fatigue, that patients might report to their examining physician.\n\nFor convenience, signs are commonly distinguished from symptoms as follows: Both are something abnormal, relevant to a potential medical condition, but a \"symptom\" is experienced and reported by the patient, while a \"sign\" is discovered by the physician during examination or by a clinical scientist by means of an in vivo examination of the patient.\n\nA slightly different definition views signs as any indication of a medical condition that can be objectively observed (i.e., by someone other than the patient), whereas a symptom is merely any manifestation of a condition that is apparent to the patient (i.e., something consciously affecting the patient). From this definition, it can be said that an asymptomatic patient is uninhibited by disease. However, a doctor may discover the sign hypertension in an asymptomatic patient, who does not experience \"dis-ease\", and the sign indicates a disease state that poses a hazard to the patient. With this set of definitions, there is some overlap – certain things may qualify as both a sign and a symptom (e.g., a bloody nose).\n\nLester S. King, author of \"Medical Thinking\", argues that an \"essential feature\" of a sign is that there is both a sign [or \"signifier\"] and a \"thing signified\". And, because \"the essence of a sign is to convey information\", it can only be a sign, properly speaking, if it has meaning. Therefore, \"a sign ceases to be a sign when you cannot read it\". A person, who has and exercises the knowledge required to understand the significance or indication or meaning of the sign, is necessary for something to be a complete sign. A physical phenomenon that is not actually interpreted as a sign pointing to something else is, in medicine, merely a symptom. Thus, King rejects \"these present-day views [distinguishing signs from symptoms based on patient-subjective versus clinician-objective], however widely accepted, as quite faulty, at variance not only with ordinary usage but with the entire history of medicine.\"\n\n\"[A] symptom is a phenomenon, caused by an illness and observable directly in experience. We may speak of it as a manifestation of illness. When the observer reflects on that phenomenon and uses it as a base for further inferences, then that symptom is transformed into a sign. As a sign it points beyond itself — perhaps to the present illness, or to the past or to the future. That to which a sign points is part of its meaning, which may be rich and complex, or scanty, or any gradation in between. In medicine, then, a sign is thus a phenomenon from which we may get a message, a message that tells us something about the patient or the disease. A phenomenon or observation that does not convey a message is not a sign. The distinction between signs and symptom rests on the meaning, and this is not perceived but inferred.\"\n\nMedical signs may be classified by the type of inference that may be made from their presence, for example:\n\n\"[If the patient's facial] appearance may be described thus: the nose sharp, the eyes sunken, the temples fallen in, the ears cold and drawn in and their lobes distorted, the skin of the face hard, stretched and dry, and the colour of the face pale or dusky.… and if there is no improvement within [a prescribed period of time], it must be realized that this sign portends death.\"\n\n\"Symptoms become signs when they permit inference. Ordinarily, one single symptom by itself—such as pain or swelling, or discoloration, or bloody discharge—would not permit any specific inference, but when symptoms occur in clusters and form a pattern, then the aggregate might point to a particular disease. The pathognomonic sign, however, does not need any other manifestation to lead the physician to the correct diagnosis. It constitutes a one-to-one relationship—the sign and the disease are uniquely related. The pathognomonic sign was the \"clincher\", the datum that established the diagnosis unequivocally.\"\n\nPrior to the nineteenth century there was little difference in the powers of observation between physician and patient. Most medical practice was conducted as a joint co-operative interaction between the physician and his aristocratic patient as equals; this was gradually replaced by a \"monolithic consensus of opinion imposed from within the community of medical investigators\". Whilst each noticed much the same things, the physician had a more informed interpretation of those things: \"the physicians knew what the findings meant and the layman did not\".\n\nHowever, the patient was gradually removed from the medical interaction due to significant technological advances such as:\n\n\nThe introduction of the techniques of percussion and auscultation into medical practice altered the relationship between physician and patient in a very significant way, specifically because these techniques relied almost entirely upon the physician listening to the sounds of the patient's body.\n\nNot only did this development greatly reduce the patient's capacity to observe and contribute to the process of diagnosis, it also meant that the patient was often instructed to stop talking, and remain silent.\n\nAs these sorts of evolutionary changes continued to take place in medical practice, it was increasingly necessary to uniquely identify data that was accessible only to the physician, and to be able to differentiate those observations from others that were also available to the patient, and it just seemed natural to use \"signs\" for the class of physician-specific data, and \"symptoms\" for the class of observations available to the patient.\n\nKing proposes a more advanced notion; namely, that a sign is something that has meaning, regardless of whether it is observed by the physician or reported by the patient:\nIn some senses, the process of diagnosis is always a matter of assessing the \"likelihood\" that a given condition is present in the patient. In a patient who presents with haemoptysis (coughing up blood), the haemoptysis is very much more likely to be caused by respiratory disease than by the patient having broken their toe. Each question in the history taking allows the medical practitioner to narrow down their view of the cause of the symptom, testing and building up their hypotheses as they go along.\n\nExamination, which is essentially looking for clinical signs, allows the medical practitioner to see if there is evidence in the patient's body to support their hypotheses about the disease that might be present.\n\nA patient who has given a good story to support a diagnosis of tuberculosis might be found, on examination, to show signs that lead the practitioner away from that diagnosis and more towards sarcoidosis, for example. Examination for signs \"tests\" the practitioner's hypotheses, and each time a sign is found that supports a given diagnosis, that diagnosis becomes more likely.\n\nSpecial tests (blood tests, radiology, scans, a biopsy, etc.) also allow a hypothesis to be tested. These special tests are also said to show signs in a clinical sense. Again, a test can be considered pathognonomic for a given disease, but in that case the test is generally said to be \"diagnostic\" of that disease rather than pathognonomic. An example would be a history of a fall from a height, followed by a lot of pain in the leg. The signs (a swollen, tender, distorted lower leg) are only very strongly suggestive of a fracture; it might not actually be broken, and even if it is, the particular kind of fracture and its degree of dislocation need to be known, so the practitioner orders an x-ray — and, for example, if the x-ray were to show a fractured tibia, the film would be diagnostic of the fracture.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "220633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220633", "title": "Point of sale", "text": "Point of sale\n\nThe point of sale (POS) or point of purchase (POP) is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout), and indicates the options for the customer to make payment. It is also the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service. After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a receipt for the transaction, which is usually printed but is increasingly being dispensed with or sent electronically.\n\nTo calculate the amount owed by a customer, the merchant may use various devices such as weighing scales, barcode scanners, and cash registers. To make a payment, payment terminals, touch screens, and other hardware and software options are available.\n\nThe point of sale is often referred to as the point of service because it is not just a point of sale but also a point of return or customer order. POS terminal software may also include features for additional functionality, such as inventory management, CRM, financials, or warehousing.\n\nBusinesses are increasingly adopting POS systems, and one of the most obvious and compelling reasons is that a POS system does away with the need for price tags. Selling prices are linked to the product code of an item when adding stock, so the cashier merely needs to scan this code to process a sale. If there is a price change, this can also be easily done through the inventory window. Other advantages include the ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers, and more efficient stock control.\n\nRetailers and marketers will often refer to the area around the checkout instead as the point of purchase (POP) when they are discussing it from the retailer's perspective. This is particularly the case when planning and designing the area as well as when considering a marketing strategy and offers.\n\nSome point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as \"retail management system\" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.\n\nNevertheless, it is the term \"POS system\" rather than \"retail management system\" that is in vogue among both end-users and vendors.\n\nThe basic, fundamental definition of a POS System, is a system which allows the processing and recording of transactions between a company and their consumers, at the time in which goods and/or services are purchased.\n\nEarly electronic cash registers (ECR) were controlled with proprietary software and were limited in function and communication capability. In August 1973, IBM released the IBM 3650 and 3660 store systems that were, in essence, a mainframe computer used as a store controller that could control up to 128 IBM 3653/3663 point of sale registers. This system was the first commercial use of client-server technology, peer-to-peer communications, local area network (LAN) simultaneous backup, and remote initialization. By mid-1974, it was installed in Pathmark stores in New Jersey and Dillard's department stores.\n\nOne of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants. It used the Intel 8008, a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, [2] Vanilla Shake, [1] Large Fries, [3] BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item. By pressing the [Grill] button, a second or third order could be worked on while the first transaction was in progress. When the customer was ready to pay, the [Total] button would calculate the bill, including sales tax for almost any jurisdiction in the United States. This made it accurate for McDonald's and very convenient for the servers and provided the restaurant owner with a check on the amount that should be in the cash drawers. Up to eight devices were connected to one of two interconnected computers so that printed reports, prices, and taxes could be handled from any desired device by putting it into \"Manager Mode\". In addition to the error-correcting memory, accuracy was enhanced by having three copies of all important data with many numbers stored only as multiples of 3. Should one computer fail, the other could handle the entire store.\n\nIn 1986, Gene Mosher introduced the first graphical point of sale software featuring a touchscreen interface under the ViewTouch trademark on the 16-bit Atari 520ST color computer. It featured a color touchscreen widget-driven interface that allowed configuration of widgets representing menu items without low level programming. The ViewTouch point of sale software was first demonstrated in public at Fall Comdex, 1986, in Las Vegas Nevada to large crowds visiting the Atari Computer booth. This was the first commercially available POS system with a widget-driven color graphic touch screen interface and was installed in several restaurants in the USA and Canada.\n\nIn 1986, IBM introduced its 468x series of POS equipment based on Digital Research's Concurrent DOS 286 and FlexOS 1.xx, a modular real-time multi-tasking multi-user operating system.\n\nA wide range of POS applications have been developed on platforms such as Windows and Unix. The availability of local processing power, local data storage, networking, and graphical user interface made it possible to develop flexible and highly functional POS systems. Cost of such systems has also declined, as all the components can now be purchased off-the-shelf.\n\nIn 1993, IBM adopted FlexOS 2.32 as the basis of their IBM 4690 OS in their 469x series of POS terminals. This was developed up to 2014 when it was sold to Toshiba, who continued to support it up to at least 2017.\n\nAs far as computers are concerned, off-the-shelf versions are usually newer and hence more powerful than proprietary POS terminals. Custom modifications are added as needed. Other products, like touchscreen tablets and laptops, are readily available in the market, and they are more portable than traditional POS terminals. The only advantage of the latter is that they are typically built to withstand rough handling and spillages; a benefit for food & beverage businesses.\n\nThe key requirements that must be met by modern POS systems include high and consistent operating speed, reliability, ease of use, remote supportability, low cost, and rich functionality. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane.\n\nReliability depends not wholly on the developer but at times on the compatibility between a database and an OS version. For example, the widely used MS Access database system had a compatibility issue when Windows XP machines were updated to a newer Windows OS. Microsoft immediately offered no solution. Some businesses were severely disrupted in the process, and many downgraded back to Windows XP for a quick resolution. Other companies utilized community support, for a registry tweak solution has been found for this.\n\nPOS systems are one of the most complex software systems available because of the features that are required by different end-users. Many POS systems are software suites that include sale, inventory, stock counting, vendor ordering, customer loyalty and reporting modules. Sometimes purchase ordering, stock transferring, quotation issuing, barcode creating, bookkeeping or even accounting capabilities are included. Furthermore, each of these modules is interlinked if they are to serve their practical purpose and maximize their usability.\n\nFor instance, the sale window is immediately updated on a new member entry through the membership window because of this interlinking. Similarly, when a sale transaction is made, any purchase by a member is on record for the membership window to report providing information like payment type, goods purchased, date of purchase and points accumulated. Comprehensive analysis performed by a POS machine may need to process several qualities about a single product, like selling price, balance, average cost, quantity sold, description and department. Highly complex programming is involved (and possibly considerable computer resources) to generate such extensive analyses.\n\nPOS systems are designed not only to serve the retail, wholesale and hospitality industries as historically is the case. Nowadays POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.\n\nDifferent customers have different expectations within each trade. The reporting functionality alone is subject to so many demands, especially from those in the retail/wholesale industry. To cite special requirements, some business's goods may include perishables and hence the inventory system must be capable of prompting the admin and cashier on expiring or expired products. Some retail businesses require the system to store credit for their customers, credit which can be used subsequently to pay for goods. A few companies even expect the POS system to behave like a full-fledged inventory management system, including the ability to provide even FIFO (First In First Out) and LIFO (Last In First Out), reports of their goods for accounting and tax purposes.\n\nIn the hospitality industry, POS system capabilities can also diverge significantly. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.\n\nIt may be said that a POS system can be made to serve different things to different end-users depending on their unique business processes. Quite often an off-the-shelf POS system is inadequate for customers; some customization is required, and this is why a POS system can become very complex. The complexity of a mature POS system even extends to remote networking or interlinking between remote outlets and the HQ such that updating both ways is possible. Some POS systems even offer the linking of web-based orders to their sale window. Even when local networking is only required (as in the case of a high-traffic supermarket), there is the ever-present challenge for the developer to keep most if not all of their POS stations running. This puts high demand not just on software coding but also designing the whole system covering how individual stations and the network work together, and special consideration for the performance capability and usage of databases. Due to such complexity, bugs and errors encountered in POS systems are frequent.\n\nWith regards to databases, POS systems are very demanding on their performance because of numerous submissions and retrievals of data - required for correct sequencing the receipt number, checking up on various discounts, membership, calculating subtotal, so forth - just to process a single sale transaction. The immediacy required of the system on the sale window such as may be observed at a checkout counter in a supermarket also cannot be compromised. This places much stress on individual enterprise databases if there are just several tens of thousands of sale records in the database. Enterprise database Ms SQL, for example, has been known to freeze up (including the OS) entirely for many minutes under such conditions showing a \"Timeout Expired\" error message. Even a lighter database like Ms Access will slow to a crawl over time if the problem of database bloating is not foreseen and managed by the system automatically. Therefore, the need to do extensive testing, debugging and improvisation of solutions to preempt failure of a database before commercialization further complicates the development.\n\nPOS system accuracy is demanding, given that monetary transactions are involved continuously not only via the sale window but also at the backend through the receiving and inputting of goods into the inventory. Calculations required are not always straightforward. There may be many discounts and deals that are unique to specific products, and the POS machine must quickly process the differences and the effect on pricing. There is much complexity in the programming of such operations, especially when no error in calculation can be allowed.\n\nOther requirements include that the system must have functionality for membership discount and points accumulation/usage, quantity and promotional discounts, mix and match offers, cash rounding up, invoice/delivery-order issuance with outstanding amount. It should enable a user to adjust the inventory of each product based on physical count, track expiry of perishable goods, change pricing, provide audit trail when modification of inventory records is performed, be capable of multiple outlet functionality, control of stocks from HQ, doubling as an invoicing system, just to name some.\n\nIt is clear that POS system is a term that implies a wide range of capabilities depending on the end-user requirements. POS system review websites cannot be expected to cover most let alone all the features; in fact, unless one is a developer himself, it is unrealistic to expect the reviewer to know all the nuts and bolts of a POS system. For instance, a POS system might work smoothly on a test database during the review but not when the database grows significantly in size over months of usage. And this is only one among many hidden critical functionality issues of a POS system.\nGOODS\n\nVendors and retailers are working to standardize development of computerized POS systems and simplify interconnecting POS devices. Two such initiatives are OPOS and JavaPOS, both of which conform to the UnifiedPOS standard led by The National Retail Foundation.\n\nOPOS (OLE for POS) was the first commonly adopted standard and was created by Microsoft, NCR Corporation, Epson and Fujitsu-ICL. OPOS is a COM-based interface compatible with all COM-enabled programming languages for Microsoft Windows. OPOS was first released in 1996. JavaPOS was developed by Sun Microsystems, IBM, and NCR Corporation in 1997 and first released in 1999. JavaPOS is for Java what OPOS is for Windows, and thus largely platform independent.\n\nThere are several communication ways POS systems use to control peripherals such as:\n\nThere are also nearly as many proprietary protocols as there are companies making POS peripherals. Most POS peripherals, such as displays and printers, support several of these command protocols in order to work with many different brands of POS terminals and computers.\n\nThe design of the sale window is the most important one for the user. This user interface is highly critical when compared to those in other software packages such as word editors or spreadsheet programs where the speed of navigation is not so crucial for business performance.\n\nFor businesses at prime locations where real estate comes at a premium, it can be common to see a queue of customers. The faster a sale is completed the shorter the queue and hence the more room available in a store for customers to shop around and employees to do their work. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.\n\nAlthough improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.\n\nThe advent of cloud computing has given birth to the possibility of POS systems to be deployed as software as a service, which can be accessed directly from the Internet using any internet browser. Using the previous advances in the communication protocols for POS's control of hardware, cloud-based POS systems are independent from platform and operating system limitations. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's IPad. Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to mobile devices, such as tablet computers or smartphones. These devices can also act as barcode readers using a built-in camera and as payment terminals using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader. A number of POS companies built their software specifically to be cloud-based. Other businesses who launched pre-2000s have since adapted their software to evolving technology.\n\nCloud-based POS systems are different from traditional POS largely because user data, including sales and inventory, are not stored locally, but in a remote server. The POS system is also not run locally, so there is no installation required.\n\nDepending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.\n\nOther advantages of a cloud-based POS are instant centralization of data (important especially to chain stores), ability to access data from anywhere there is internet connection, and lower start-up costs.\n\nCloud based POS requires an internet connection. For this reason it important to use a device which has its own 3G capability in case the device's primary internet goes down. In addition to being significantly less expensive than traditional legacy point of sale systems, the real strength of a cloud based point of sale system is that there are developers all over the world creating software applications for cloud based POS. Cloud based POS systems are often described as future proof as new applications are constantly being conceived and built.\n\nA number of noted emerging cloud-based POS systems came on the scene less than a decade or even half a decade back. These systems are usually designed for restaurants, small and medium-sized retail operations with fairly simple sale processes as can be culled from POS system review sites. It appears from such software reviews that enterprise-level cloud-based POS systems are currently lacking in the market. \"Enterprise-level\" here means that the inventory should be capable of handling a large number of records, such as required by grocery stores and supermarkets. It can also mean that the system--software and cloud server--must be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation.\n\nPOS vendors of such cloud based systems should also have a strong contingency plan for the breakdown of their remote server such as represented by failover server support. However, sometimes even a major data center can fail completely, such as in a fire. On-premises installations are therefore sometimes seen alongside cloud-based implementation to preempt such incidents, especially for businesses with very high traffic. However the on-premises installations may not have the most up-to-date inventory and membership information.\n\nFor such contingency, a more innovative though highly complex approach for the developer is to have a trimmed down version of the POS system installed on the cashier computer at the outlet. On a daily basis the latest inventory and membership information from the remote server is automatically updated into the local database. Thus should the remote server fail, the cashier can switch over to the local sale window without disrupting sales. When the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system, thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database.\n\nAlthough cloud-based POS systems save the end-user startup cost and technical challenges in maintaining an otherwise on-premises installation, there is a risk that should the cloud-based vendor close down it may result in more immediate termination of services for the end-user compared to the case of a traditional full on-premises POS system where it can still run without the vendor.\n\nAnother consideration is that a cloud-based POS system actually exposes business data to service providers - the hosting service company and the POS vendor which have access to both the application and database. The importance of securing critical business information such as supplier names, top selling items, customer relationship processes cannot be underestimated given that sometimes the few key success factors or trade secrets of a business are actually accessible through the POS system. This security and privacy concern is an ongoing issue in cloud computing.\n\nThe retail industry is one of the predominant users of POS terminals.\n\nA retail point of sale system typically includes a cash register (which in recent times comprises a computer, monitor, cash drawer, receipt printer, customer display and a barcode scanner) and the majority of retail POS systems also include a debit/credit card reader. It can also include a conveyor belt, weight scale, integrated credit card processing system, a signature capture device and a customer pin pad device. While the system may include a keyboard and mouse, more and more POS monitors use touch-screen technology for ease of use, and a computer is built into the monitor chassis for what is referred to as an all-in-one unit. All-in-one POS units liberate counter space for the retailer. The POS system software can typically handle a myriad of customer based functions such as sales, returns, exchanges, layaways, gift cards, gift registries, customer loyalty programs, promotions, discounts and much more. POS software can also allow for functions such as pre-planned promotional sales, manufacturer coupon validation, foreign currency handling and multiple payment types.\n\nThe POS unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the entire POS system used in a retail business. \"Back-office\" computers typically handle other functions of the POS system such as inventory control, purchasing, receiving and transferring of products to and from other locations. Other typical functions of a POS system are: store sales information for enabling customer returns, reporting purposes, sales trends and cost/price/profit analysis. Customer information may be stored for receivables management, marketing purposes and specific buying analysis. Many retail POS systems include an accounting interface that \"feeds\" sales and cost of goods information to independent accounting applications.\n\nA multiple point of sale system used by big retailers like supermarkets and department stores has a far more demanding database and software architecture than that of a single station seen in small retail outlets. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations.\n\nAt the same time updating between multiple stations and the backend administrative computer should be capable of being efficiently performed, so that on one hand either at the start of the day or at any time each station will have the latest inventory to process all items for sale, while on the other hand at the end of the day the backend administrative computer can be updated in terms of all sale records.\n\nThis gets even more complicated when there is a membership system requiring real-time two-way updating of membership points between sale stations and the backend administrative computer.\n\nRetail operations such as hardware stores (lumber yards), electronic stores and so-called multifaceted superstores need specialized additional features compared to other stores. POS software in these cases handles special orders, purchase orders, repair orders, service and rental programs as well as typical point of sale functions. Rugged hardware is required for point of sale systems used in outdoor environments. Wireless devices, battery powered devices, all-in-one units, and Internet-ready machines are typical in this industry.\n\nRecently new applications have been introduced, enabling POS transactions to be conducted using mobile phones and tablets. According to a recent study, mobile POS (mPOS) terminals are expected to replace the contemporary payment techniques because of various features including mobility, upfront low cost investment and better user experience.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the blind community in the United States engaged in structured negotiations to ensure that retail point of sale devices had tactile keypads. Without keys that can be felt, a blind person cannot independently enter her or his PIN. In the mid-2000s retailers began using \"flat screen\" or \"signature capture\" devices that eliminated tactile keypads. Blind people were forced to share their confidential PIN with store clerks in order to use their debit and other PIN-based cards. The blind community reached agreement with Walmart, Target, CVS and eight other retailers that required real keys so blind people could use the devices.\n\nEarly stores typically kept merchandise behind a counter. Staff would fetch items for customers to prevent the opportunity for theft and sales would be made at the same counter. Self-service grocery stores such as Piggly Wiggly, beginning in 1916, allowed customers to fetch their own items and pass the point of sale on the way to the exit. Many stores have a number of cash registers for checkout, possibly now including self-checkout. This requires customers to guess which line will move the fastest, if they want to minimize their wait times; they are often frustrated to be wrong or be stuck behind another customer who encounters a problem or who takes a long time to check out. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person. Regardless of the configuration, checkout lines usually pass by impulse buy items to grab the attention of otherwise idle customers.\n\nHospitality point of sale systems are computerized systems incorporating registers, computers and peripheral equipment, usually on a computer network to be used in restaurants, hair salons or hotels. Like other point of sale systems, these systems keep track of sales, labor and payroll, and can generate records used in accounting and bookkeeping. They may be accessed remotely by restaurant corporate offices, troubleshooters and other authorized parties.\n\nPoint of sale systems have revolutionized the restaurant industry, particularly in the fast food sector. In the most recent technologies, registers are computers, sometimes with touch screens. The registers connect to a server, often referred to as a \"store controller\" or a \"central control unit\". Printers and monitors are also found on the network. Additionally, remote servers can connect to store networks and monitor sales and other store data.\n\nTypical restaurant POS software is able to create and print guest checks, print orders to kitchens and bars for preparation, process credit cards and other payment cards, and run reports. In addition, some systems implement wireless pagers and electronic signature-capture devices.\n\nIn the fast food industry, displays may be at the front counter, or configured for drive-through or walk-through cashiering and order taking. Front counter registers allow taking and serving orders at the same terminal, while drive-through registers allow orders to be taken at one or more drive-through windows, to be cashiered and served at another. In addition to registers, drive-through and kitchen displays are used to view orders. Once orders appear they may be deleted or recalled by the touch interface or by bump bars. Drive-through systems are often enhanced by the use of drive-through wireless (or headset) intercoms. The efficiency of such systems has decreased service times and increased efficiency of orders.\n\nAnother innovation in technology for the restaurant industry is wireless POS. Many restaurants with high volume use wireless handheld POS to collect orders which are sent to a server. The server sends required information to the kitchen in real time. Wireless systems consist of drive-through microphones and speakers (often one speaker will serve both purposes), which are wired to a \"base station\" or \"center module.\" This, in turn, will broadcast to headsets. Headsets may be an all-in-one headset or one connected to a belt pack.\n\nIn hotels, POS software allows for transfer of meal charges from dining room to guest room with a button or two. It may also need to be integrated with property management software.\n\nNewer, more sophisticated systems are getting away from the central database \"file server\" type system and going to what is called a \"cluster database\". This eliminates any crashing or system downtime that can be associated with the back office file server. This technology allows 100% of the information to not only be stored, but also pulled from the local terminal, thus eliminating the need to rely on a separate server for the system to operate.\n\nTablet POS systems popular for retail solutions are now available for the restaurant industry. Initially these systems were not sophisticated and many of the early systems did not support a remote printer in the kitchen. Tablet systems today are being used in all types of restaurants including table service operations. Most tablet systems upload all information to the Internet so managers and owners can view reports from anywhere with a password and Internet connection. Smartphone Internet access has made alerts and reports from the POS very accessible. Tablets have helped create the Mobile POS system, and Mobile POS applications also include payments, loyalty, online ordering, table side ordering by staff and table top ordering by customers. Regarding the payments, mobile POS can accept all kinds of payment methods from contactless cards, EMV chip-enabled cards, and mobile NFC enabled cards. Mobile POS (AKA mPOS) is growing quickly with new developers entering the market almost on a daily basis.\n\nWith the proliferation of low-priced touchscreen tablet computers, more and more restaurants have implemented self-ordering through tablet POS placed permanently on every table. Customers can browse through the menu on the tablet and place their orders which are then sent to the kitchen. Most restaurants that have iPad self-order menus include photos of the dishes so guests can easily choose what they want to order. This apparently improves service and saves manpower on the part of the restaurant. However this depends on how intelligently the system has been programmed to be.\nAs a case in point, some self-ordering systems not requiring staff assistance may not properly recognize a subsequent order from the same customer at a table. As a result, the customer is left waiting and wondering why his second order of food and drink is not being served.\n\nAnother example of how intelligent the system can be, is whether an order that has been placed but not yet been processed by the kitchen can be modified by the customer through the tablet POS. For such an unprocessed order the customer should be given the option to easily retrieve his order and modify it on the tablet POS. But when his order is being processed this function should then be automatically disabled.\n\nSelf-ordering systems are not always free completely from intervention by the staff and for some good reasons. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. If alcoholic drinks are ordered, it also becomes necessary for the waiter to first verify the age of the customer before sending the order.\n\nThe technical specifications for implementing such self-ordering system are more demanding than a single cashier-controlled POS station. On the software and hardware side each tablet on a customer table has to be networked to the cashier POS station and the kitchen computer so that both are continually updated on orders placed. The common database that serves this network must also be capable of serving many concurrent users - cashier, customers, kitchen and perhaps even a drink bar.\n\nIt is therefore to be noted by developers that some databases like popularly used Ms Access may have the specifications that it is capable of usage by multiple concurrent users. However under the stress of a POS system, they can fail miserably resulting in constant errors and corruption of data.\n\nPOS systems are often designed for a variety of clients, and can be programmed by the end users to suit their needs. Some large clients write their own specifications for vendors to implement. In some cases, POS systems are sold and supported by third-party distributors, while in other cases they are sold and supported directly by the vendor.\n\nThe selection of a restaurant POS system is critical to the restaurant's daily operation and is a major investment that the restaurant's management and staff must live with for many years. The restaurant POS system interfaces with all phases of the restaurant operation and with everyone that is involved with the restaurant including guests, suppliers, employees, managers and owners. The selection of a restaurant POS system is a complex process that should be undertaken by the restaurant owner and not delegated to an employee. The purchase process can be summarized into three steps: Design, Compare and Negotiate. The Design step requires research to determine which restaurant POS features are needed for the restaurant operation. With this information the restaurant owner or manager can Compare various restaurant POS solutions to determine which POS systems meet their requirements. The final step is to Negotiate the price, payment terms, included training, initial warranty and ongoing support costs.\n\nPOS systems record sales for business and tax purposes. Illegal software dubbed \"zappers\" can be used on POS devices to falsify these records with a view to evading the payment of taxes.\n\nIn some countries, legislation is being introduced to make cash register systems more secure. For example, the French treasury is estimated to be failing to collect approximately €14 billion of VAT revenue each year. The Finance Bill of 2016 is intended to address some of this loss by making it compulsory for taxpayers to operate on “secure systems”. Therefore, from 1 January 2018, all retail businesses in France are required to record customer payments using certified secure accounting software or cash register systems. \n\nA certified cash register system must provide for the (i) inalterability, (ii) security and (iii) storage and archiving of data. All businesses required to comply must obtain a certificate from the cash register system provider which certifies that the system meets these requirements. This is because VAT taxpayers may need to provide a certificate to the tax authorities showing that their cash management system fulfils the new requirements.\n\nIf the business cannot provide this certificate to the tax authorities, they may be fined. And, if the tax authorities can demonstrate fraudulent use of the system, both the business and the software provider can face tax penalties, fines, and criminal sanctions. Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d’accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.\n\nDespite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. A dishonest cashier at a retail outlet can collude with a friend who pretends to be just another customer. During checkout, the cashier can bypass scanning certain items or enter a lower quantity for some items thus profiting thereby from the \"free\" goods.\n\nThe ability of a POS system to void a closed sale receipt for refund purpose without needing a password from an authorized superior also represents a security loophole. Even a function to issue a receipt with a negative amount which can be useful under certain circumstances, can be exploited by a cashier to easily lift money from the cash drawer.\n\nIn order to prevent such employee theft, it is crucial for a POS system to provide an admin window for the boss or administrator to generate and inspect a daily list of sale receipts, especially pertaining to the frequency of cancelled receipts before completion, refunded receipts and negative receipts. This is one effective way to alert the company to any suspicious activity - such as a high number of cancelled sales by a certain cashier - that may be going on and to take monitoring action.\n\nTo further deter employee theft, the sale counter should also be equipped with a closed-circuit television camera pointed at the POS system to monitor and record all the activities.\n\nAt the backend, price and other changes like discounts to inventory items through the administration module should also be secured with passwords provided only to trusted administrators. Any changes made should also be logged and capable of being subsequently retrieved for inspection.\n\nThe sale records and inventory are highly important to the business because they provide very useful information to the company in terms of customer preferences, customer membership particulars, what are the top selling products, who are the vendors and what margins the company is getting from them, the company monthly total revenue and cost, just to name some.\n\nIt is therefore important that reports on these matters generated at the administrative backend be restricted only to trusted personnel. The database from which these reports are generated should also be secured via passwords or via encryption of data stored in the database so as to prevent them from being copied or tampered with.\n\nDespite all such precautions and more, the POS system can never be entirely watertight in security from internal misuse if a clever but dishonest employee knows how to exploit many of its otherwise useful capabilities.\n\nNews reports on POS system hacking show that hackers are more interested in stealing credit card information than anything else. The ease and advantage offered by the ability of a POS system to integrate credit card processing thus have a downside. In 2011, hackers were able to steal credit card data from 80,000 customers because Subway's security and POS configuration standards for PCI Compliance - which governs credit card and debit card payment systems security - were \"directly and blatantly disregarded\" by Subway franchisees.\n\nIn June 2016, several hundred of Wendy's fast food restaurants had their POS systems hacked by an illegally installed malware. The report goes on to say that \"the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cybersecurity attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated\" and that the \"hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year\".\n\nAgain, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database.\n\nIn April 2017, security researchers identified critical vulnerabilities in point of sale systems developed by SAP and Oracle and commented, “POS systems are plagued by vulnerabilities, and incidents occurred because their security drawbacks came under the spotlight.” If successfully exploited, these vulnerabilities provide a perpetrator with access to every legitimate function of the system, such as changing prices, and remotely starting and stoping terminals. To illustrate the attack vector, the researchers used the example of hacking POS to change the price of a MacBook to $1. The security issues were reported to the vendor, and a patch was released soon after the notification. Oracle confirmed security bug affects over 300,000 Oracle POS Systems\n\nIn some countries, credit and debit cards are only processed via payment terminals. Thus one may see quite a number of such terminals for different cards cluttering up a sale counter. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers.\n\nWith the launch of mobile payment particularly Android Pay and Apple Pay both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals. However, for mobile payment to go fully mainstream, mobile devices like smartphones that are NFC-enabled must first become universal. This would be a matter of several years from the time of this writing (2017) as more and more models of new smartphones are expected to become NFC-enabled for such a purpose. For instance, iPhone 6 is fully NFC-enabled for mobile payment while iPhone 5 and older models are not. The aforesaid disastrous security risks connected with processing payment card usage through a POS system would then be greatly diminished.\n"}
{"id": "37570028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37570028", "title": "Questione Ladina", "text": "Questione Ladina\n\nThe Questione Ladina asks whether the Romance languages or dialects spoken in the Alps, namely Romansh, Ladin and Friulian, form a proper language subfamily or should rather be regarded as a part of a wider Northern Italian dialect continuum.\n\nThe beginning of the Questione Ladina is marked by the publication of the \"Saggi ladini\" by Graziadio Isaia Ascoli (1829–1907), who identified the area between the Oberalp Pass and the Gulf of Trieste as a specific language area, with some common characteristics, and called the idioms spoken there \"Ladin dialects\". The theory gained a large circulation with the publications of the Austrian linguist Theodor Gartner, who, however, used \"Rhaeto-Romance\" instead of \"Ladin\" as an umbrella term.\n\nThe idea of a Ladin unity was strongly opposed by Carlo Battisti (1882–1977), who demonstrated, in several studies, that the whole range of dialects in question showed only a few common characteristics and was just as closely related to neighbouring Lombard and Venetian varieties. The dialectologist Carlo Salvioni held similar views.\n\nBoth the idea of a distinctive language sub-family and the denial of a Ladin unity still have strong proponents, the former especially among Swiss, German and Austrian, the latter among Italian linguists. A third position has been taken by other linguists (e.g. Heinrich Schmid, Andreas Schorta, Pierre Bec, Geoffrey Hull), who agree with the Italianists that the Rhaeto-Romance dialects are archaic variants of the adjacent vernaculars of Lombardy, Trentino and Venetia, but differ from them in considering the entire Rhaeto-Cisalpine or 'Padanian' linguistic unity to be an integral unit of Gallo-Romance and structurally not Italo-Romance, in spite of superficial Italian influences in certain areas (Liguria, the Veneto and Istria primarily, but also in Friuli and parts of Lombardy).\n\nA characteristic is the commixture of grammatical and sociolinguistic aspects, as well as of linguistic and political-ideological convictions. Battisti and Salvioni's research was influenced by sympathies for the Italian irredentism, leading to the demand that speakers of Romansh should accept Italian as a \"Dachsprache\" because of their \"Italianity\", and subsequently to linguistically justified political claims that the Romansh-speaking Graubünden should become part of Italy. On the other hand, Swiss linguists regarded mere grammatical features as subordinated to sociolinguistic and historic considerations, and they strongly supported the idea of a separate \"language\".\n"}

It is notable as the only complete Esperantido created by the original creator of Esperanto, L. L. Zamenhof. Although Zamenhof's stated preference was to avoid any discussion of changes, he was put under considerable pressure, including financial, to respond to the diverse reforms proposed by others. Reluctantly he decided to present a reformed dialect himself and undertook to continue guiding the community, whether or not reforms were eventually agreed upon.\n\nAlthough Zamenhof initially called his reform a systematic attempt to re-create the language in the light of more than six years of practical experience, scarcely any of the Esperanto community of the time accepted it as a whole. The majority voted to reject all changes. Zamenhof himself later rejected the whole project and referred to 1894 as 'a wasted year'. In 1907 he expressly refused permission to anyone wishing to re-publish the proposed reforms. In 1929 Johannes Dietterle cited this refusal as justification for omitting details of the reform project from his collection of Zamenhof's complete works, \"Originala Verkaro\".\n\nSome of the proposed reforms from 1894 such as replacing the -oj plural with -i, the removal of the diacritics and adjectival agreement were used in the language reform project Ido beginning in 1907, but these were not accepted by the Esperanto community either and Esperanto has changed relatively little since the publication of Zamenhof's \"Fundamento de Esperanto\" in 1905.\n\n\nThe Lord's Prayer in both Reformed and standard Esperanto for comparison:\n\nThe Reformed version follows Zamenhof's revised roots.\n\n"}
{"id": "8091612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8091612", "title": "Resistance (psychoanalysis)", "text": "Resistance (psychoanalysis)\n\nResistance, in the context of the field of psychoanalysis, refers to oppositional behavior when an individual's unconscious defenses of the ego are threatened by an external source. Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalytic theory, developed his concept of resistance as he worked with patients who suddenly developed uncooperative behaviors during sessions of talk therapy. He reasoned that an individual that is suffering from a psychological affliction, which Sigmund Freud believed to be derived from the presence of suppressed illicit or unwanted thoughts, may inadvertently attempt to impede any attempt to confront a subconsciously perceived threat. This would be for the purpose of inhibiting the revelation of any repressed information from within the unconscious mind.\n\nHaving developed the theory of resistance through his direct experiences with patients undergoing therapy, Sigmund Freud noticed that patients would avoid subjects and topics that struck too closely to uncomfortable memories or unacceptable emotions and desires. Freud then integrated these findings with his previous theories concerning the functions of the id, ego and super-ego. As a result, he eventually advanced his concept of resistance by developing it into a multitude of individual forms that included repression, transference, ego-resistance, \"working-through\", and self-sabotage.\n\nThe common theory behind many of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic techniques, alluding to the fundamentals of psychoanalysis as a science, was that it is possible that memories that have been lost from consciousness provide hints of their existence by the means of prompting certain thoughts and behaviors. Accordingly, the aim of psychoanalysis is to bring what is unconscious or preconscious into consciousness through verbalization. Afterwards, the act of bringing such thoughts into consciousness prevents them from motivating behavior and thus allowing the individual to exert more personal control.\n\nThroughout its history, resistance has caused significant division between psychologists. It remains a debated issue as there are some who considered it to be merely a description of a patient’s temperament rather than a universal construct of the human mind. Nonetheless, the concept of resistance retains a firm place in the history of psychology and the development of modern psychoanalysis.\n\nRepression is the form of resistance where the ego pushes offensive memories, ideas, and impulses down into the unconscious. Essentially, the patient is unconsciously hiding memories from the conscious mind.\n\nTypically unconscious, transference is when the patient allows past experiences to affect present relationships. In therapy, this may come about if the therapist reminds the patient, either consciously or unconsciously, of someone in their past who may have had an early impact on their life. Subsequently, the patient may suddenly tend to regard the therapist in either a positive or negative manner, depending upon the nature of the past influence.\n\nThis form of resistance is a neurotic regression to a proposed state of childlike safety. Usually, it involves the patient's attempts to gain attention and sympathy by emphasizing minor medical symptoms (i.e. headaches, nausea, and depression).\n\nDerived from the id, this form of resistance reflects the unconscious desire for consistency in a manner that is based upon the pleasure principle. Since the id is an innate portion of human instinct, interpretation of the conscious is an insufficient method, thus the psychoanalyst must first be able to surmount resistances by the means of deduction of patients' unconscious defenses that are presented through exploitation of the mechanism of transference.\n\nThe weakest form of resistance that reflects the moralistic sentiments of the superego. Essentially, it is a manifestation of internal guilt that prompts personal punishment by the means of self-imposed impediment.\n\nPsychoanalysis is, altogether, considered to be a type of insight-oriented therapeutic program. Despite general initial reservations, these types of programs have since transitioned from being quite marginal to becoming more well-known and mainstream. In consideration to the theory of resistance itself, within a clinical setting, the expression of resistance is considered to be a significant stage to recovery because it reveals the presence of repression. Additionally, it is indicative of progress in the effort of resolving any underlying issues that may be the cause of personal dysfunction. As resistance is theorized to be a manifestation of the unconscious mind's attempts to protect the ego, it is the task of the psychoanalyst to combat this opposition by directing the patient to confront the unacceptable desires or uncomfortable memories. By this course of action, the patient may reach a cathartic conclusion.\n\nPsychologists remain divided with regard to the concept of resistance. Since Freud first developed his theory of resistance, he has been significantly criticized for using personally favorable and unfalsifiable methodology. For example, if a patient were to agree with a psychoanalyst's inference about themselves, it is a confirmation that there is something they are repressing. However, if the patient disagrees, it is also a sign they are engaged in repression, which means the psychoanalyst is correct in either scenario. Additionally, many psychologists believe that the success of psychoanalysis is not due its various explanatory systems or its reasoning for repression, but rather simply due to the process of communication.\n"}

{"id": "146745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146745", "title": "Search warrant", "text": "Search warrant\n\nA search warrant is a court order that a magistrate or judge issues to authorize law enforcement officers to conduct a search of a person, location, or vehicle for evidence of a crime and to confiscate any evidence they find. In most countries a search warrant cannot be issued in aid of civil process.\n\nJurisdictions that respect the rule of law and a right to privacy constrain police powers, and typically require search warrants or an equivalent procedure for searches police conducted in the course of a criminal investigation. The laws usually make an exception for hot pursuit: a police officer following a criminal who has fled the scene of a crime has the right to enter a property where the criminal has sought shelter. This contrasts with authoritarian regimes, where police typically can search property and people without having to provide justification or secure court permission.\n\nIn England and Wales, a local magistrate issues search warrants, which require that a constable provide evidence that supports the warrant application. In the majority of cases where police already hold someone in custody, police can search premises without a search warrant under Section 18 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), which requires only the authority of an inspector.\n\nUnder Section 18(5)a of PACE, a constable can conduct a search immediately without an inspector's authorisation. This subsection allows a constable to search the home of a suspect(s) under arrest in their presence before they take the suspect to a police station (or other custody location). Under Section 32 of PACE, a constable who arrests a person who is on their own property or has just left their premises, may immediately search both the suspect and the immediate area.\n\nIn Scotland, a country operating on the distinct legal system of Scots law compared to England and Wales - the restrictions governing the use and execution of search warrants are set out under Part XIII under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Search warrants must be signed by a Sheriff after a petition from police.\n\nGas company officials may enter a home to inspect, repair, or replace gas meters and gas appliances by obtaining a warrant.\n\nTo get a warrant, police must present a judge with an ITO (information to obtain) form that contains reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an offence has been or is being committed, and that the authorization sought will afford evidence of that offence. This hearing is 'ex parte' meaning only the crown is present. This fact obliges the police to include any known facts that hurt their application.\n\nAfter a search the occupants have a copy of the warrant and may get hold of the ITO through crown disclosure if the occupant(s) are charged. There are numerous different warrant procedures in the Criminal Code, some have specific requirements such as being served during daytime or having a named supervising officer present in the case of a home search. If these(see link) requirements are not met by the police the evidence found may become inadmissible against the accused at trial.\n\nUnder the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, most police searches require a search warrant based on probable cause, although there are exceptions. In the absence of valid consent or an exception to the warrant requirement, whether for purposes of effecting a search or an arrest, police entry in an individual's home always requires a warrant. The probable cause standard for obtaining a search warrant is lower than the quantum of proof required for a later conviction, proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnder the Fourth Amendment, search warrants must be reasonable and specific. This means that a search warrant must reasonably identify the items to be searched for and the place where law enforcement officials are authorized to search for those items. Unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies, the search of other buildings or areas of a building, persons or vehicles, or the search for additional items that do not reasonably fall under the original warrant, will normally require additional search warrants.\n\nTo obtain a search warrant, an officer must prove to a magistrate or judge that probable cause exists for the proposed search, based upon direct information (i.e., the officer's personal observation) or other reliable information. An application for a search warrant will often rely upon hearsay information, such as information obtained from a confidential informant, as long as probable cause exists based on the totality of the circumstances. Police can seize both property and persons under a search warrant. The rationale is that evidence police collect without a search warrant may not be sufficient to convict, but may be sufficient to suggest that a warrant would allow police to find enough evidence to convict.\n\nThe issue of federal warrants is determined under Title 18 of the United States Code. The law has been restated and extended under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Federal search warrants may be prepared on Form AO 93, Search and Seizure Warrant. Although the laws are broadly similar, each state has its own laws and rules of procedure governing the issuance of warrants.\n\nSearch warrants are normally available to the public. On the other hand, they may be sealed if they contain sensitive information. \n\nCertain searches don't require a search warrant. For example,\n\n\nIn a plain view case, the officer is legitimately on the premises, his observation is from a legitimate vantage point, and it is immediately obvious that the evidence is contraband. The plain view rule applies, for example, when the officer has pulled the suspect over for a seat belt violation and sees a syringe on the passenger seat.\n\nIf the subject is arrested in a home or vehicle, police may perform a protective search to make sure that there are no weapons within the vicinity. For example, they may search for weapons the room where they arrested the subject of a warrant, and conduct a \"protective sweep\" of the premises if they reasonably suspect that other individuals may be hiding.\n\nWith rented property, a landlord may refuse to allow law enforcement to search a tenant's apartment without a search warrant, and police must obtain a warrant under the same guidelines as if the tenant were the owner of the property.\n\nPeople who are occupying rooms at hotels or motels have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their rooms. However, a warrantless search may be possible if the hotel guest has property in their room a considerable period of time after the scheduled check-out time.\n\nAs first established by \"Carroll v. United States\", police are allowed to search a vehicle without a search warrant when they have probable cause to believe that evidence or contraband is located in a vehicle. When police arrest an individual shortly after the individual has exited a vehicle, the police may conduct a full search of the suspect's person, any area within that person's immediate reach, and the passenger compartment of the recently occupied vehicle for weapons or any other contraband. However, \"Arizona v. Gant\" limits such searches to circumstances where the arrested person could have accessed the vehicle, or when the vehicle could contain evidence of the crime the person is arrested for. As per \"Collins v. Virginia\", the exception does not apply when the vehicle is on the private property of its owner.\n\nUnder The Border Search Exception custom and immigration officers are not required to have a warrant or probable cause to conduct searches and seizures at international borders and their functional equivalents.\n\nThis doctrine is not actually an exception to the Fourth Amendment, but rather to the Amendment's requirement for a warrant or probable cause. Balanced against the sovereign's interests at the border are the Fourth Amendment rights of entrants. Not only is the expectation of privacy less at the border than in the interior, the Fourth Amendment balance between the interests of the Government and the privacy right of the individual is also struck much more favorably to the Government at the border. This balance at international borders means that routine searches are \"reasonable\" there, and therefore do not violate the Fourth Amendment's proscription against \"unreasonable searches and seizures\".\n\nA sneak and peek search warrant (officially called a delayed notice warrant and also a covert entry search warrant or a surreptitious entry search warrant) is a search warrant authorizing the law enforcement officers executing it to effect physical entry into private premises without the owner's or the occupant's permission or knowledge and to clandestinely search the premises.\n\nIn California, the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act mandates that in certain cases concerning electronic search warrants that the court issue gag orders \"[...] prohibiting any party providing information from notifying any other party that information has been sought [...]\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2263791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2263791", "title": "Sentence-final particle", "text": "Sentence-final particle\n\nSentence-final particles, including modal particles, interactional particles, etc., are minimal lexemes (words) that occur at the end of a sentence and that do not carry referential meaning, but may relate to linguistic modality, register or other pragmatic effects. Sentence-final particles are common in Chinese, including particles such as Mandarin \"le\" 了, \"ne\" 呢, \"ba\" 吧, \"ou\" 哦, \"a\" 啊, \"la\" 啦, \"ya\" 呀, and \"ma\" 嗎/吗, and Cantonese \"lo\" 囉 and \"ge\" 嘅. These particles act as qualifiers of the clause or sentence they end. Sentence-final particles are also present in Japanese and many East Asian languages, such as Thai, and especially in languages that have undergone heavy Sino-Tibetan influence, such as the Monguor languages.\n\nYuen Ren Chao has described sentence-final particles as \"phrase suffixes\": just as a word suffix is in construction with the word preceding it, a sentence-final particle or phrase suffix is \"in construction with a preceding phrase or sentence, though phonetically closely attached to the syllable immediately preceding it\". According to Chao, the sentence-final particle is phonetically close to the last word before it, but syntactically it is equidistant from every word in the whole predicate.\n\nWhile sentence-final particles usually do not carry meaning themselves or denote anything explicit, they may be derived from words that do carry meaning when they occur in other contexts and serve different functions.\n\nAll of the sentence-final particles of Standard Chinese are unstressed and, unlike most syllables in the language, do not carry tone.\n\n\nA major use of sentence-final particles in Mandarin Chinese specifically is thought to be as a signal of the speaker's attitude, the intended force of the statement to which the particle is attached, and \"how the utterance is to be taken by the hearer.\" For example, the addition of a particle may soften the tone of a question that might sound presumptuous or inappropriate without the particle. As such, sentence-final particles in this sense often perform an interpersonal function, rather than a grammatical one. Nevertheless, there are cases in which sentence-final particles do perform grammatical functions, such as Mandarin \"ma\" 嗎/吗, the \"question particle,\" which changes the grammatical mood of a sentence to interrogative. Likewise, even though sentence-final particles can usually be omitted from a sentence without making the sentence ungrammatical or changing its meaning, some particles do contain information critical to the interpretation of an utterance's meaning, such as Mandarin \"le\" 了.\n\nIn Japanese, there are many sentence-final particles that are used in formal as well as colloquial speech. Some examples include:\n\n\nEnglish also has some words and phrases that act somewhat like sentence final particles, but primarily only in colloquial speech. However, there are others, called tag questions, which are less colloquial and can be used for any situation. All are generally discourse particles rather than modal particles. For example:\nAll but the first are tag questions. Notice how when the main sentence is affirmative, the tag question is negative, and vice versa.\n\nIn the same way that certain words and phrases are used as sentence final particles above in the section on English (as discourse particles), some Spanish words and phrases can be used this way as well; once again, these are usually called tag questions. For example:\nNote that in Spanish, the question marks are placed around the tag question, and not around the entire sentence (although English only uses the single final question mark, it is implied that the entire sentence, and not just the tag, is the question).\n\n"}

In consonant clusters, voicing distinction is neutralized and all consonants assimilate the voicing of the rightmost segment. In this context, , and may occur as voiced allophones of , and , respectively (e.g. \"vŕh drevésa\" ).\n\n\nThe preposition \"v\" is always bound to the following word; however its phonetic realization follows the normal phonological rules for .\n\nThe sequences , and occur only before a vowel. Before a consonant or word-finally, they are reduced to , and respectively. This is reflected in the spelling in the case of , but not for and . The reduction of non-prevocalic and occurs in standard Slovene, but not for certain dialects, where speakers use and in this position instead.\n\nUnder certain (somewhat unpredictable) circumstances, historical at the end of a syllable has become , the allophone of in that position. This change has occurred in the endings of all past participles. For many derivatives of words ending in that historically had , both and can be used, sometimes depending on the context it is being used in.\n\nSlovene has an eight-vowel (according to Peter Jurgec nine-vowel) system, in comparison to the five-vowel system of Serbo-Croatian.\n\n\nJurgec proposes the existence of a ninth vowel that in traditional pronunciation (see below under Prosody) would rather be analyzed as a short . However, since the more recent studies indicate that native speakers don't actually phonemically distinguish long and short vowels yet the distinction between and is quite consistently perceived, and moreover there is a noticeable distinction in quality and a lesser distinction in quantity between these two vowels, there is reason to treat these two sounds as two different phonemes.\n\nThe near-open can only appear in the word-final stressed syllable before the syllable coda, as in \"čas\" 'time'. Due to the restrictions stated above, the open usually appears in its place in other declinational forms of the same word: \"časa\" , not , 'time (gen.)'. The analysis as two different phonemes is also reinforced by the fact that in some words the phoneme appears in the very same position that would permit , leading to a phonemic contrast: \"pas\" , not , 'belt'.\n\nJurgec also states that in the tonemic varieties of the language, the near-open vowel can carry only the high tone (see below), which is \"parallel to the pattern for the [, and ].\" He also notes that similarly to , the schwa likewise only appears in closed syllables, i.e. as the nucleus before the syllable coda. On the basis of these observations he concludes that the near-open vowel \"behaves in a systematic way within the vowel system of Slovenian.\"\n\nAccording to , is inserted epenthetically, and its distribution is fully predictable. He also says that \"[d]escriptions of schwa distribution are offer[ed] in lexical rather than grammatical terms. These were also based on historical data and did not consider actual speech of educated speakers in Ljubljana, nowadays considered standard.\"\n\nThe dialectal distribution of vs. and vs. is inconsistent with the distribution in Standard Slovene. This influences the way speakers of such dialects speak Standard Slovene.\n\nSlovene has been traditionally described as distinguishing vowel length, which correlates with stress and is therefore discussed in the prosody section, below. The distinction between and , and between and is only made when they are stressed and long. When short or unstressed, they are not distinguished: short stressed variants are realized as open-mid , while the unstressed variants are, broadly speaking, true-mid vowels . In fact, however, the unstressed mid vowels have two realizations:\nThe unstressed mid vowels are never as close as the stressed close-mid vowels and never as open as the stressed open-mid vowels . However, report true-mid allophones of the close-mid vowels occurring in the sequences and , but only if a vowel does not follow within the same word. One could therefore argue that the unstressed mid vowels are simply allophones of the close-mid vowels, whereas the open-mid vowels do not occur in unstressed positions. Another argument for transcribing the unstressed mid vowels as is that these symbols are easier to write than .\n\nIn the colloquial spoken language, unstressed and most short stressed vowels tend to be reduced or elided. For example, \"kȕp\" ('heap') > , \"právimo\" ('we say') > .\n\nScholars have found that vowel length in standard Slovene is no longer distinctive, and that the only differences in vowel length are that the stressed vowels are longer than the unstressed ones, and that stressed open syllables are longer than stressed closed syllables. Stressed syllables are characterized by amplitude and pitch prominence.\n\nIn tonemic varieties, stressed syllables also have a distinction of phonemic tone (high or low).\n\nAll dialects of Slovene have phonemic stress, but the same word can be accented quite differently in different dialects. Most words have a single syllable that carries stress. Some compounds, but not all, have multiple stresses, inherited from the parts that make up the compound. There are also a few small words and clitics, including prepositions, that have no inherent stress at all and attach prosodically to another word.\n\nIn non-final syllables, quantitative accent (increased syllable length) is also present in almost all words. In tonemic varieties, stressed syllables also have a distinction of phonemic tone (high or low). Stress and vowel length are closely intertwined:\n\n\nNote that vowel length is clearly phonemic in stressed final syllables, which can be either long or short. In other syllables, however, whether vowel length or stress, or both, are phonemic depends on the underlying phonological analysis. Generally speaking, stress and length co-occur in all but the final syllable, so one feature or the other is phonetically redundant in those words.\n\nThe standard language has two varieties, tonemic and non-tonemic. These differ only in the presence of phonemic tonal distinctions on stressed syllables (i.e. pitch accent) in the former. Phonemic tone exists only in a north-south band of dialects in the center of the country (the Upper and Lower Carniolan dialect groups and part of the Carinthian dialect group). However, because the Slovenian capital city Ljubljana is located within the central tonemic dialect area, phonemic tone was included in the standard language, and in fact the tonemic variety is more prestigious and is universally used in formal TV and radio broadcasts.\n\nThe exact distribution and phonetic realization of tonemes varies locally. In Standard Slovene, some words with the traditionally long vowels may have either a high or low tone.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, this article discusses the tonemes as they are realized in Standard Slovene spoken in Ljubljana.\n\nIn the tonemic variety, the following additional rules apply to stressed vowels (unstressed vowels never carry tonal distinction):\n\n\nThis leads to the following possible combinations of tone, length and vowel quality:\n\nNote that tautosyllabic stressed behaves like a long vowel in terms of the tones it can bear, and in fact it is notated as such in the tonemic writing system (see above). Examples: \"pr̂stnica\" ('phalanx') with high tone vs. \"pŕstanəc\" ('finger') with low tone. However, since it does not have any length distinction, it is equally valid to class it as a short vowel.\n\nThe non-tonemic system is identical to the tonemic system above in terms of vowel length and stress, but lacks any phonemic tone. This means that, for those dialects, the first and second rows merge, as do the third and fourth.\n\nSimilarly, for many speakers who do not distinguish short and long vowels, the first and third rows merge, as do the second and fourth. An exception to this is the traditional , which does not merge with . Instead, the former is realized as .\n\nThe sample text is a reading of the first sentence of The North Wind and the Sun.

{"id": "2455651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2455651", "title": "Supergrass (informant)", "text": "Supergrass (informant)\n\nSupergrass is a British slang term for an informant who turns Queen's evidence, often in return for protection and immunity from prosecution. In the British criminal world, police informants have been called \"grasses\" since the late 1930s, and the \"super\" prefix was coined by journalists in the early 1970s to describe those who witnessed against fellow criminals in a series of high-profile mass trials at the time.\n\nThe first known use of \"grass\" in that context is Arthur Gardner's crime novel \"Tinker's Kitchen\", published in 1932, in which a \"grass\" is defined as \"an informer\". The origin of the term \"grass\" being used as signifying a traitor, a person who informs on people he or she knows intimately, ostensibly can be traced to the expression \"snake in the grass\", which has a similar meaning. The phrase derives from the writings of Virgil (in Latin, \"latet anguis in herba\") and has been known in the English language, meaning \"traitor\", since the late 17th century.\n\nAn alternative claim is made for the term originating from rhyming slang, whereby \"grasshopper\" is defined as \"copper\", meaning \"policeman\". The rhyming slang version was supported in 1950 by lexicographer Paul Tempest, who wrote\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the term \"supergrass\" especially refers to arrested paramilitaries who divulged the identities of their compatriots to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, possibly in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Sir John Hermon did not deny reports that inducements were paid but denied figures as high as £50,000 were involved. The use of the term in Northern Ireland began with the arrest of Christopher Black in 1981. After securing assurances that he would have protection from prosecution, Black gave statements which led to 38 arrests. On 5 August 1983, 22 members of the Provisional IRA were sentenced to a total of more than 4,000 cumulative years in prison, based on Black's testimonies alone (eighteen of these convictions were overturned on appeal on 17 July 1986).\n\nBy the end of 1982, 25 more 'supergrasses' had surfaced contributing to the arrests of over six hundred people from paramilitary organizations, such as the Provisional IRA, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) and the Ulster Volunteer Force. On 11 April 1983, members of the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force were jailed on the evidence of supergrass Joseph Bennett. These convictions were all overturned on 24 December 1984. In October 1983, seven people were convicted on the evidence provided by supergrass Kevin McGrady although the trial judge Lord Chief Justice Robert Lowry had described McGrady's evidence as \"bizarre, incredible and contradictory\". The last supergrass trial finished on 18 December 1985, when 25 members of the INLA were jailed on the evidence of Harry Kirkpatrick. Twenty-four of these convictions were later overturned on 23 December 1986.\n\nMany convictions based on supergrass testimony were later overturned, and the supergrass system was discontinued in 1985 until reintroduction in 2011. The first supergrass trial in 26 years began on 8 September 2011 for the murder of Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member Tommy English. In Northern Ireland the term \"tout\" is a popular alternative to \"grass\". The Police Service of Northern Ireland have refused to use this term and prefer the term Assisting Offender, based on the legislation that enables the use of such evidence.\n\nThe term has been used more recently to describe an informant with al-Qaeda links testifying at the trials for seven British men conspiring to cause explosions between 1 January 2003 and 31 March 2004, and again on 2 July 2007 in an article in the \"Daily Mail\" describing a search for informants in the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack.\n\nThe term has also been used by \"The Royal Gazette\", a daily newspaper in Bermuda, a British dependent territory. An article in the paper uses the term to describe a Transport Control Department worker convicted of selling driver's licenses to Portuguese applicants lacking the necessary English skills to pass the multiple choice exam. The worker was granted a conditional discharge in exchange for information on other Transport Control Department employees abusing the public trust.\n\nOne of the most prolific supergrasses in recent British history was Michael Michael whose evidence in 2001 led to 32 criminals being convicted, including his own mother, and the disruption of a £132 million drug ring.\n\n\n"}

The formula as enunciated in the 1968 National Policy Resolution which provided for the study of \"Hindi, English and modern Indian language (preferably one of the southern languages) in the Hindi speaking states and Hindi, English and the Regional language in the non-Hindi speaking States\".\n\nThe formula was formulated in response to demands from non-Hindi speaking states of the South, such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and mainly Tamil Nadu. Currently, the three language system is not followed in Tamil Nadu due to efforts of former Chief Minister C. N. Annadurai.\n\nThe first recommendation for a three-language policy was made by the University Education Commission in 1948–49, which did not find the requirement to study three languages to be an extravagance, citing the precedents of the Netherlands and Switzerland. While accepting that Hindi was itself a minority language, and had no superiority over others such as Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Punjabi, Malayalam,Urdu and Gujarati all of which had a longer history and greater body of literature, the commission still foresaw Hindi as eventually replacing English as the means by which every province may participate in Federal functions.\n\nThe Education Commission of 1965–66 recommended a modified or graduated three-language formula. Following some debate, the original three-language formula was adopted by the India Parliament in 1968. The 1986 National Policy on Education reiterated the 1968 formula.\n\nIn 1972 the government launched a committee for promotion of Urdu under the chairmanship of I. K. Gujral. The committee's 1975 report recommended safeguards for significant (i.e. greater than 10 percent) Urdu-speaking minorities which included the use of Urdu for official purposes and as a medium of instruction. Following consideration of the report by the Cabinet in 1979, and by the Taraqqui-e-Urdu Board from 1979 to 1983, modified proposals from the Gujral committee were passed on to the state governments in 1984.\n\nA new committee of experts was launched in 1990 under the chairmanship of Ali Sardar Jafri to examine implementation of the Gujral committee recommendations. This committee recommended modifying the three-language formula to \"In Hindi speaking States: (a) Hindi (with Sanskrit as part of the composite course); (b) Urdu or any other modern Indian language and (c) English or any other modern European language. In non-Hindi speaking States: (a) the regional language; (b) Hindi; (c) Urdu or any other modern Indian language excluding (a) and (b); and (d) English or any other modern European language\".\n\nC. N. Annadurai, then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, opposed the requirement to learn Hindi in Tamil Nadu, \"What serves to link us with the outside world is certainly capable of rendering the same service inside India as well. To plead for two link languages is like boring a smaller hole in a wall for the kitten while there is a bigger one for the cat. What suits the cat will suit the kitten as well.\"\n\nAcademics have noted the failure of the formula. Harold F. Schiffman, an expert on Dravidian culture at the University of Pennsylvania, observed that the formula \"has been honored in the breach more than in reality\" and that due the lack of a symbolic national language, there is a tendency \"for English to take over as the instrumental language\" in India. Political scientist Brian Weinstein of Howard University said that \"neither Hindi nor non-Hindi speaking states followed the (1968) directive\".\n"}
