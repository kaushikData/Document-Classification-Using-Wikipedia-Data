{"id": "9695744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9695744", "title": "Audio synchronizer", "text": "Audio synchronizer\n\nAn audio synchronizer is a variable audio delay used to correct or maintain audio-video sync or timing also known as lip sync error. See for example the specification for audio to video timing given in ATSC Document IS-191. Modern television systems use large amounts of video signal processing such as MPEG preprocessing, encoding and decoding, video synchronization and resolution conversion in pixelated displays. This video processing can cause delays in the video signal ranging from a few microseconds to tens of seconds. If the television program is displayed to the viewer with this video delay the audio-video synchronization is wrong, and the video will appear to the viewer after the sound is heard. This effect is commonly referred to as A/V sync or lip sync error and can cause serious problems related to the viewer's enjoyment of the program.\n\nTo correct audio video sync problems, the video processing circuitry outputs a DDO (digital delay output) signal, which carries information about the amount of delay the video signal experiences due to the video processing. The DDO may, for example, be provided by equipment which adheres to the SMPTE Audio to Video Synchronization Standard. The audio synchronizer receives the DDO signal and in response delays the audio by an equivalent amount, thereby maintaining proper audio-video sync. Modern audio synchronizers operate by digitizing and writing the audio signal into a ring memory, which is most commonly a RAM-based memory having independent read and write ability. At the appropriate delay time (as conveyed by the DDO) after an audio sample (or group of samples) are written into the memory, the previously stored audio sample is read from the ring memory. The storage and reading of the audio samples take place continuously in response to the respective memory write and read addresses, which increment by 1 count for every write or read operation. For example, an audio sample would be written at address 1, a different sample read from (previously written) address 5, another sample is written at address 2, yet another read from 6, write at 3, read from 7 and so on. The delay between writing and reading a particular sample is 4 addresses which, when multiplied by the amount of time it takes to change from one address to the next, gives the total audio delay.\n\nUnfortunately, video delays frequently make quick and large changes, for example, a jump in delay time from 2 seconds to 6 seconds is possible. To maintain proper audio-video sync, the audio delay must track these video delay changes. Changing the audio delay requires changing the difference between the write address and the read address. This change can be accomplished by causing either the write or read address to jump forward or backward, however, this jump causes some audio samples to repeat or be lost resulting in an unwanted and annoying pop, click, gap, distortion and/or noise in the audio signal. Some audio synchronizers operate by making repeated, very small jumps that cause unwanted (but less annoying) distortion and noise in the audio signal, rather than pops, gaps, and clicks. Other audio synchronizers change delay by changing the speed of the reading of audio from the ring memory. If audio samples are read out of the memory more slowly than they are written, the delay increases. If audio samples are read out faster than they are written the delay decreases. Using variable speed reading prevents pops, clicks, gaps, distortion and noise from being introduced into the audio, but does create unwanted and annoying pitch errors. For example, reading faster than writing causes the audio pitch to increase and reading slower than writing causes the pitch to decrease.\n\nAudio synchronizers that use variable speed reading are generally preferred in professional applications. The control of audio delay is generally more accurate and more easily accomplished. Pitch errors in lower performance devices are uncompensated and kept to a level generally not perceived by the average viewer, by limiting the amount of change of reading speed. Typically the change limit is in the order of 0.2%. Unfortunately, this limits the rate of delay change and when large video delay changes occur the slow tracking rate of these uncompensated synchronizers can cause the audio-video sync to be off for several seconds or minutes until the audio delay catches up with the video delay. Additionally, listeners with excellent pitch perception may notice and be annoyed by even these small pitch errors.\n\nIn higher performance audio synchronizers, the rate of delay change is allowed to be much faster, generally in the order of 25%, and the resulting pitch error is corrected with a pitch correction circuit. The pitch correction circuitry is frequently a proprietary design, due to the difficulty in performing correction so the errors are imperceptible to critical listeners. These higher performance audio synchronizers allow the audio delay to track even large and quick video delay changes without generating any artifacts that are perceptible to even critical listeners for most audio program material.\n\nRecent development in video processing devices permit those devices to sense when a large video delay change will need to be made beforehand and allow that change information to be communicated to the audio synchronizer. The \"advanced notice\" from the video processing device allows the audio synchronizer to anticipate and take advantage of particular audio material (e.g., periods of relative silence or periods without music) to facilitate making corresponding large audio delay changes that do not risk generating noticeable audio artifacts. Further developments permit handshaking between the video processing device and the audio synchronizer to control when the video delay change is made to optimize the timing of the tracking audio delay change thereby further reducing the risk of generating noticeable audio artifacts and at the same time reducing the risk of missynchronization due to rapid video delay changes.\n\n"}

When stocks of a certain stamp ran out, postmasters sometimes resorted to cutting higher denominated stamps in half, vertically or diagonally, thus obtaining two \"stamps\" each representing half of the original monetary value, or \"face\" value, of the uncut stamp. The general public also resorted to this practice, sometimes pursuant to official or tacit permission and sometimes without any express authorization.\n\nMany of these instances have been well documented in postal history. One example is the bisects of the Island of Guernsey during the German military occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II. Early Mexican stamps are known to have been used cut in half, three-quarters, quarters and even eighths.\n\nMany bisects and splits are considerably more valuable than the stamps from which they were made. These, however, only have philatelic value when the cut portion is still affixed to the envelope or a piece showing the postmarks, as otherwise it cannot be confirmed that the stamp was in fact postally used as a split and not simply a complete stamp that was cut up after use. \n"}
{"id": "24074672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24074672", "title": "Breech-loading swivel gun", "text": "Breech-loading swivel gun\n\nA breech-loading swivel gun was a particular type of swivel gun and a small breech-loading cannon invented in the 14th century. It was equipped with a swivel for easy rotation and was loaded by inserting a mug-shaped device called a chamber, filled with gunpowder and projectiles. It had a high rate of fire, as several chambers could be prepared in advance and quickly fired in succession and was especially effective in anti-personnel roles. It was used for centuries by many countries of Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nAlthough breech-loading is often considered a modern innovation which facilitated the loading of cannons, breech-loading swivel guns were invented in the 14th century, and used worldwide from the 16th century onward by numerous countries, many of them non-European. They have been called by many names, sometimes \"Murderer\" in English, \"Perrier à boîte\" in French, \"Berços\" in Portuguese, \"Versos\" in Spanish, \"Stangenbüchse\" in German, \"Folangji\" (\"佛朗机炮/佛朗機砲, Frankish gun\") in Chinese, \"Bulang-kipo\" (\"불랑기포[佛郞機砲]\") in Korean, \"Furanki\" (仏郎機砲, \"Frankish gun\") or 子砲 (\"Child cannon\") in Japanese, and \"Cetbang\" in Javanese. Some of them were used until the 20th century.\n\nBreech-loading swivel guns were developed surprisingly early, and were used from 1336 onward. The guns were loaded with mug-shaped chambers, in which gunpowder and projectile had been filled in advance. The chamber was then put in place, blocked with a wedge, and then fired. As the loading was made in advance and separately, breech-loading swivel guns were quick-firing guns for their time. An early description of a breech-loading swivel gun puts the weight of the gun at , equipped with three chambers for rotations, each in weight, and firing a lead shot. The guns had a disadvantage: they leaked and lost power around the chambers, but this was compensated by the high rate of fire as multiple chambers could be prepared in advance. Breech-loading swivel gun could fire either cannonballs against obstacles, or grapeshot against troops.\n\nDuring the Middle-Ages, breech-loading swivel guns were developed by the Europeans also partly as a cheaper alternative to the very expensive bronze cast muzzle-loading cannons, as bronze was many times more expensive than iron. As cast iron was not yet technologically feasible for the Europeans, the only possibility was to use wrought iron bars hammered together and held with hoops like barrels. With this method, a one piece design was very difficult, and a fragmental structure, with separated chamber and barrel was then selected.\nAround 1500, Europeans learnt how to cast iron, and shifted their cannon productions to one-piece iron muzzle-loaders. China started to adopt European breech-loading swivel guns from 1500 onward, limiting at the same time the production of their own muzzle-loaders, because of the high effectiveness of the breech-loading swivel gun as an anti-personnel gun, which to them was more interesting than the sheer power of a cannonball.\n\nUsage of the breech-loading swivel gun continued in Europe however, with, as early as the 17th century, characteristics very similar to the modern machine-gun or mitrailleuse.\n\nBreech-loading swivel guns were used to advantage at the bow and stern on warships, but were also used in fortifications.\n\nBreech loading cannons were used in Majapahit conquest (1336-1350). Prior to this, the Javanese acquired firearm technology from 1293 Mongol invasion. The cannon is called Cetbang and can be configured as stationary gun or swivel gun, mounted on various vessels of Majapahit navy. At that time soldiers of other kingdoms in the Nusantaran archipelago fought using melee weapons in an elevated platform in their ships called \"Balai\". This new weapon proved very effective, and Majapahit is able to conquer the archipelago in only 14 years.\n\nIn China and Japan, breech-loading swivel guns were brought after China defeated the Portuguese in the 16th century. At the Battle of Xicaowan in 1522, after defeating the Portuguese in battle, the Chinese captured Portuguese breech-loading swivel guns and then reverse engineered them, calling them \"Folangji\" (佛郎機 (Frankish) guns, since the Portuguese were called \"Folangji\" by the Chinese. A shipwreck in 1523 apparently brought the gun to China, but the transmission may have occurred earlier. In Japan, Ōtomo Sōrin seems to have been the first recipient of the guns, possibly as early as 1551. In 1561 the Portuguese, allied with Otomo in the Siege of Moji, bombarded rival Japanese position, possibly with swivel guns. In the Battle of Takajō in 1587, Ōtomo Sōrin used two swivel guns obtained from the Portuguese. The guns were nicknamed .\n\nIn the later portions of the Ming dynasty (mid 16th century onward) it appears that these type of guns were the most common and numerous type of artillery used by the Ming forces. a great deal of variation of such cannons were produced, and it appeared in pretty much all of the conflicts of this time, including the Imjin War. Until the introduction of heavy Dutch cannons in the early 17th century, there were even attempts by the Ming to make large heavy versions of such guns.\n\nOther countries also used swivel guns. In Bali, such a gun was found in the possession of the Raja of Badung, and is now located in the Bali Museum. Numerous such guns were also used in Northern Africa by Algerian rebels in their resistance to French forces.\n\nBreech-loading swivel guns were also used extensively in Southeast Asia as early as the 16th century, apparently even before the arrival of the Portuguese and Spanish there, and continued to be in use as a preferred anti-personnel weapon as late as the 20th century. The Americans fought \"Moros\" equipped with breech-loading swivel guns in the Philippines in 1904.\n\nSteel rifled breech-loading swivel guns are known which were manufactured by the United States towards the end of the 19th century, and used in colonial theaters such as in Madagascar.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "202337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202337", "title": "Chagatai language", "text": "Chagatai language\n\nChagatai ( ') is an extinct Turkic language which was once widely spoken in Central Asia, and remained the shared literary language there until the early 20th century. Chagatai is the common predecessor of Uzbek and Uyghur. It was also spoken by the early Mughal rulers in the Indian subcontinent, where it influenced the development of Hindustani. Ali-Shir Nava'i was the greatest representative of Chagatai literature.\n\nAs part of the preparation for the 1924 establishment of the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, Chagatai was officially renamed \"Old Uzbek\", which Edward A. Allworth argued \"badly distorted the literary history of the region\" and was used to give authors such as the 15th-century author Ali-Shir Nava'i an Uzbek identity. It was also referred to as \"Sart\". In China it is sometimes called \"ancient Uyghur\".\n\nThe word \"Chagatai\" relates to the Chagatai Khanate (1225 –1680s), a descendant empire of the Mongol Empire left to Genghis Khan's second son, Chagatai Khan. Many of the Chagatai Turks and Tatars, who were the speakers of this language, claimed descent from Chagatai Khan.\n\nChagatai belongs to the Karluk branch of the Turkic language family. It is descended from the Old Turkic language that served as a lingua franca in Central Asia, with a strong infusion of Arabic and Persian words and turns of phrase. Its literary form was based on two earlier literary Middle Turkic languages, Karakhanid and Khorezmian. It can be divided into three periods:\n\n\nThe first period is a transitional phase characterized by the retention of archaic forms; the second phase starts with the publication of Ali-Shir Nava'i's first Divan and is the highpoint of Chagatai literature, followed by the third phase, which is characterized by two bifurcating developments. One is the preservation of the classical Chagatai language of Nava'i, the other trend is the increasing influence of the dialects of the local spoken languages.\n\nThe Chagatai Turkic language lived its heyday under the Timurid dynasty. Chagatai remained the universal literary language of Central Asia until the Soviet reforms of the early 20th century, and had a marked influence on the development of the Hindustani language.\n\nUzbek and Uyghur are the two modern languages most closely related to Chagatai. Uzbeks regard Chagatai as the origin of their own language and claim Chagatai literature as their own. In 1921 in Uzbekistan, then a part of the Soviet Union, Chagatai was replaced by a literary language based on a local Uzbek dialect. The so-called Berendei, a 12th-century nomadic Turkic people possibly related to the Cumans, seem also to have spoken Chagatai.\n\n\"Ethnologue\" records the use of the word \"Chagatai\" in Afghanistan to describe the \"Tekke\" dialect of Turkmen. Up to and including the eighteenth century, Chagatai was the main literary language in Turkmenistan as elsewhere in Central Asia. While it had some influence on Turkmen, the two languages belong to different branches of the Turkic language family.\n\nThe most famous of the Chagatai poets is Ali-Shir Nava'i, who – among his other works – wrote \"Muhakamat al-Lughatayn\", a detailed comparison of the Chagatai and Persian languages, in which he argued for the superiority of the former. His fame is attested by the fact that Chagatai is sometimes called \"Nava'i's language\". Among prose works, Timur's biography is written in Chagatai Turkic, as is the famous \"Baburnama\" (or \"Tuska Babure\") of Babur, the Timurid founder of the Mughal Empire.\n\nImportant works continued to be written in the Chagatai language into the early twentieth century. Among them are Musa Sayrami's \"Tārīkh-i amniyya\" (completed 1903) and its revised version \"Tārīkh-i ḥamīdi\" (completed 1908), representing the best sources on the Dungan Revolt (1862–77) in Xinjiang.\n\nThe following are books written on the Chagatai language by natives and westerners.:\n\n\nThe Qing dynasty commissioned dictionaries on the major languages of China which included Chagatai Turki, such as the Pentaglot Dictionary.\n\nChagatai literature is still studied in modern Turkey and regarded as part of the Turkic heritage.\n\nThe Chagatai alphabet is based on the Perso-Arabic alphabet and known as \"Kona Yëziq\" (old script).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56314", "title": "Champerty and maintenance", "text": "Champerty and maintenance\n\nChamperty and maintenance are archaic doctrines in common law jurisdictions that aim to preclude frivolous litigation: \n\nIn \"Giles v Thompson\" Lord Justice Steyn declared: \" In modern idiom maintenance is the support of litigation by a stranger without just cause. Champerty is an aggravated form of maintenance. The distinguishing feature of champerty is the support of litigation by a stranger in return for a share of the proceeds\".\n\nAt common law, maintenance and champerty were both crimes and torts, as was barratry (the bringing of vexatious litigation). This is generally no longer so as, during the nineteenth century, the development of legal ethics tended to obviate the risks to the public, particularly after the scandal of the Swynfen will case (1856–1864). However, the principles are relevant to modern contingent fee agreements between a lawyer and a client and to the assignment by a plaintiff of his rights in a lawsuit to someone with no connection to the case. Champertous contracts can still, depending on jurisdiction, be void for public policy or attract liability for costs.\n\nThe restrictions arose to combat abuses in medieval England. Unscrupulous nobles and royal officials would lend their names to bolster the credibility of doubtful and fraudulent claims in return for a share of the property recovered. Speaking extrajudicially in the early seventeenth century, Lord Chief Justice Coke described the origins of maintenance in this way:\n\nThe comments were made in context of the court previously having been anxious to prevent a wide range of maintenance; the phrase \"maintenance\" had been used to apply not just to those who gave support in civil claims, but also to those who sought to maintain robbers, heretics and even \"a new sect coming from beyond the sea, clad in white garments\". Judicial independence was gradually established, however, and by the early 19th century Jeremy Bentham wrote:\n\nIn Australia, champerty and maintenance as common law causes of action (as either a crime or a tort) have mostly been abolished by statute. \nIn New South Wales, champerty and maintenance were abolished by the \"Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993\". \nIn Victoria, champerty and maintenance was abolished as a tort by section 32 of the \"Wrongs Act 1958\". and as a crime by section 332A of the \"Crimes Act 1958\"\n\nIn Canada, the common law crimes of champerty and maintenance were abolished, alongside all remaining common law offences except contempt of court, by the 1953 consolidation of the Criminal Code. However, champerty and maintenance remain torts in some Canadian jurisdictions.\n\nIn Ontario, champertous agreements are invalid under the Champerty Act, RSO 1897, c. 327.\n\nMaintenance and champerty have not been crimes or torts since the passing of the Criminal Law Act 1967, though embracery was a crime until the Bribery Act 2010. However, the 1967 Act stated:\n\nThere are circumstances in which a non-party who funds litigation can be liable for costs, if the action fails.\n\nFor instance, in \"Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd\" the Court of Appeal reincarnated the tort against the assignment of a wrongful trading claim by a liquidator to a specialist litigation company to pursuing directors for wrongful trading. This has come under criticism given that claims against directors are enforced sub-optimally as company liquidators, typically accountants, are cautious to take on risks rather than save as much of the company as possible.\n\nThe common law was amended by two acts of law, the Serious Crimes act 2007 section 44 to section 46. The act replaces the common law crime of incitement with a statutory offence of encouraging or assisting crime. While at common law there is still perverting and tending to pervert the course of public justice, and malicious prosecutions, which is abuse of process laws.\nThe Criminal justice act 1967 at section 5 regulated concealments and giving false information.\nOn the basis which is well known in relation to Fraud:\n the fraud must be pleaded by the defendant;\n statements and representations must have been made that were false;\n that were likely to interfere with the course of justice in some material respect; and\n at the time they were made the maker had no honest belief in their truth and knew they were likely to interfere with the course of justice.\nThe CJC explicitly rejected the suggestion that anything short of fraud, such as exaggerations or perception of a truth.\n\nIn Law Common purpose or joint enterprise is a liability of those aiding, paying, planning and partaking in the crime or wrong.\nThe Observance of due process 1368 said \" \"eschew the Mischiefs and Damages done to divers of his Commons by false Accusers, which oftentimes have made their Accusations more for Revenge and singular Benefit, than for the Profit of the King, or of his People, which accused Persons\"...\" \nTherefore the crime exists where the course of justice is perverted that there was no good faith and that the others supporting them knew that the claim was false and had concealed this facts and aided in the perversion itself. Due to \"old law\" the crime extended to solicitors, prosecutors and police as well as the private individuals and witnesses. which will and can fall also as Perjury.\nTo Champion a cause which is known to be unlawful false and a abuse, is Champerty and Maintenance. maintenance is not only monies (funding), but in the loss to others from the venture.\n\nIn Hong Kong, champerty and maintenance were long thought to be obsolete both as a crime and a tort, but these two principles have been revived in recent years in response to the prevalence of recovery agents which present problems quite different from the mischief which historically these rules intended to combat.\n\nThe recovery agents typically perform \"ambulance chasing\" on accident victims, offering to arrange lawyers to handle their claims on a \"no win no fee\" basis. If the claim succeeds the recovery agents share a portion of the damages. This is seen as deception on uneducated victims who are ignorant to the availability of legal aid. The division of the damages in effect deprives the victims of the just compensation that they are entitled to for their bodily injury. The intermeddling of recovery agents in the lawsuit also presents ethical problems to lawyers, who may have undermined impartiality in advising on settlement. In response, the Department of Justice and the Law Society of Hong Kong carried out a massive publicity campaign aiming at educating the public to refuse recovery agents, citing that maintenance and champerty are criminal offences under the laws of Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2008, 21 people were arrested for champerty, maintenance and conspiracy. They were recovery agents \"helping\" accident victims on a \"no win no fee\" basis. One of the people arrested was a lawyer. Champerty and maintenance carries a sentence of up to seven years in Hong Kong.\n\nOn 25 June 2009, Winnie Lo Wai Yan, a solicitor, was convicted for conspiracy to maintain and a recovery agent was convicted for conspiracy to champer. She was found to have agreed to share 25% from the damages paid to the next friend of an 18-year-old traffic accident victim who suffered from permanent total loss of earning capacity. On 10 July 2009, Lo was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment and the recovery agent was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment (Case number: DCCC 610/2008). Lo appealed in the same year and on 3 December 2010, her appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Case number: CACC 254/2009).\n\nOn 30 January 2012, Lo's conviction was quashed in the Court of Final Appeal (Case number: FACC 2/2011). The Reasons for Judgment, published on 23 February 2012, stated that there is a serious problem with the finding made and endorsed by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal respectively that Lo knew that there had been champerty involved. Although the judge found maintenance and champerty are constitutional, he questioned whether criminal liability for maintenance should be retained in Hong Kong as liability for both maintenance and champerty were abolished in places such as England and South Australia.\n\nOn 26 March 2013, Louie Mui Kwok-keung, a barrister, was sentenced in the District Court to 3.5 years of imprisonment. He pleaded not guilty on 18 February 2013, to five counts of champerty and maintenance, allegedly committed between 1999 and 2008. He was the first barrister in the city to be convicted of such crimes (Case number: DCCC 890/2012).\n\nThe Maintenance and Embracery Act 1634 passed by the Parliament of Ireland provides that \"all statutes heretofore made in England concerning maintenance, champerty and embracery, or any of them now standing and being in their full strength and force, shall be put in due execution in this realme of Ireland\". The act is still in force in the Republic of Ireland. In 2015 Persona, which lost to Esat Digifone in a 1997 telecoms bidding process criticised by the Moriarty Tribunal, applied to launch a lawsuit against those involved in the 1997 bidding, to be funded by a UK company, Harbour Litigation Funding, in return for part of any damages awarded. In 2016, the High Court ruled that such third-party funding constituted champerty prohibited by the 1634 act; Persona said it would have to drop the case, being unable to afford the €10m expenses.\n\nMaintenance and champerty are torts, not crimes, under New Zealand law. Despite calls for their abolition, the New Zealand Law Commission recommended their preservation in a 2001 report titled \"Subsidising Litigation\".\n\nThis concept exists in American jurisprudence but disdained by \"fans of entrepreneurial lawyering in the academy and elsewhere\". There has been recent common usage of the term in the media in Nevada and Ohio. In \"NAACP v. Button\" laws that overburden free speech rights in the name of preventing champerty were found to be unconstitutional. Courts in Florida have found that the causes of action for maintenance and champerty are no longer viable in Florida, but have been superseded by laws related to abuse of process, malicious prosecution, and wrongful initiation of litigation. Florida courts have held that champerty and maintenance may continue to exist as affirmative defenses, but only as to the enforceability of the champertous contract itself.\n\n\n"}

The FCI is primarily used to support asset management initiatives of federal, state, and local government facilities organizations. This would also include universities, housing and transportation authorities, and primary and secondary school systems.\n\nMathematically the FCI is represented as\n\nThe FCI as a tool was first published in 1991 by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO).\n\nApplied Management Engineering (AME) was approached by a research group working on a project that was sponsored by NACUBO. The group asked for a written description of the facility condition assessment process, and related data analysis. The resulting written process and analysis served as the basis for the book.\n\nTwo of the AME employees that contributed were William H. (Bill) Thomas and the late Emmett Richardson. Both had previously worked for the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), which is the U.S. Navy's facilities engineering Systems Command. Thomas and Richardson had calculated the FCI for budget preparation and used the ratio to allocate operations and maintenance money across naval activities and installations. The FCI was a strictly informal tool that Thomas and Richardson used while working for the Navy. It was developed and adopted as an industry benchmark by AME.\n\nTo calculate an FCI a facility manager needs to quantify the cost of maintenance, repair and replacement deficiencies. This is typically the outcome of a Facility Condition Assessment. The current replacement value is defined as what monetary value the organization places on the facility.\n\nThe FCI is a relative indicator of condition, and should be tracked over time to maximize its benefit. It is advantageous to define condition ratings based on ranges of the FCI. \"Managing the Facilities Portfolio\" provided a set of ratings: good (under 0.05), fair (0.05 to 0.10), and poor (over 0.10) based on evaluating data from various clients at the time of the publication.\n\nToday, many organizations are determining an appropriate FCI range for these ratings based upon their mission and strategic goals. The Higher Education Facilities Officers, APPA, use the FCI as part of their Strategic Assessment Model, and as a key Facilities Performance Indicator. Recommendation #6 in the National Research Council publication entitled \"Stewardship of Federal Facilities states that performance indicators should be used to evaulate the effectiveness of facilities maintenance and repair programs. The American Public Works Association publication, Special Report #62, describes the use and value of facility condition rating systems in Chapter 3.6.\n\nWithin the US Federal Government, the \"condition index\" (CI) is a general measure of the constructed asset’s condition at a specific\npoint in time. Within the US Federal Government, CI is calculated using the same formula of the ratio of Repair Needs to Plant Replacement Value (PRV) but results are presented as a percentage where higher values mean better conditions. \"Repair Needs\" is the amount necessary to ensure that a constructed asset (i.e. building or structure) is restored to a condition substantially equivalent to the originally intended and designed capacity, efficiency, or capability. \"Plant Replacement Value\" (or \"Functional Replacement Value\") is the cost of replacing an existing building or structure at today’s standards.\n\nThe FCI can be used in the development and usage of Building Information Modeling for existing buildings. It is anticipated that future BIM will adhere to the format set forth by the Construction Specifications Institute.\n\n\n"}

Among his teachers was poet Leonardo De Martino (1830-1923), whose influence is omnipresent in Shiroka's verse. His earliest verse publication, \"All'Albania, all'armi, all'armi!\" (\"To Albania, to arms, to arms!\"), was a nationalist poem on the defense of Ulcinj, which was written in Italian and printed in the Osservatore Cattolico (\"Catholic Observer\") of Milan in 1878. Like many Albanian intellectuals of the late 19th century, Shiroka spent much of his life in exile. In 1880, after the defeat of the League of Prizren, he emigrated to the Middle East, and settled in Egypt and Lebanon where he worked as an engineer in railway construction. Shiroka became a member of a society named Vëllazëria Shqiptare (Albanian brotherhood) that was founded in Cairo during 1894 by Albanian expatriates.\n\nShiroka's nationalist, satirical and meditative verse in Albanian was written mostly from 1896 to 1903. It appeared in journals such as Faik Konitza's \"Albania\", the Albanian periodicals published in Egypt, and the Shkodër religious monthly \"Elçija i Zemers t'Jezu Krisctit\" (\"The Messenger of the Sacred Heart\"). Shiroka, who also used the pseudonyms Gegë Postripa and Ulqinaku, is the author of at least sixty poems, three short stories, articles and several translations, in particular of religious works for Catholic liturgy. His verse collection, \"Zâni i zêmrës\", Tirana, 1933, (\"The voice of the heart\"), which was composed at the turn of the century, was published by Ndoc Nikaj two years before Shiroka's death in Beirut.\n\nShiroka's verse, inspired by early-19th-century French and Italian romantic poets such as Alfred de Musset (1810-1857), Alfonse de Lamartine (1790-1869), and Tommaso Grossi (1790-1853), whom he had read as a young man in Shkodër, does not cover any unusual thematic or lexical range, nor is it all of literary quality, though the latter assertion is no doubt valid for most Rilindja poets. Shiroka is remembered as a deeply emotional lyricist, and as one of linguistic purity, who was obsessed with his own fate and that of his distant homeland. Recurrent in his work, there is the theme of nostalgia for the country of his birth.\n\nBe off, swallow\nFarewell, for spring has come,\nBe off, swallow, on your flight,\nFrom Egypt to other lands,\nSearching over hill and plain\nBe off to Albania on your flight,\nOff to Shkodër, my native town!\n\nConvey my greetings\nTo the old house where I was born,\nAnd greet the lands around it\nWhere I spent my early years;\nBe off thither on your flight,\nAnd greet my native town!\n\nAnd when you come to Fush' e Rmajit,\nSwallow, stop there and take your rest;\nIn that land of sorrow are the graves\nOf the mother and father who raised me;\nWeep in your exquisite voice\nAnd lament them with your song!\n\nFor ages I have not been to Albania\nTo attend those graves;\nYou, swallow, robed in black,\nWeep there on my behalf,\nWith that exquisite voice of yours\nLament them with your song!\n"}

Moreover, the terms used by men are generally loanwords from Carib while those used by women are Arawak.\n\nThe Garifuna language was declared a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2008 along with Garifuna music and dance.\n\nGarifuna is spoken in Central America, especially in Honduras (146,000 speakers), but also in Guatemala (20,000 speakers), Belize (14,100 speakers), Nicaragua (2,600 speakers), and the US, particularly in New York City, where it is spoken in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. By the 1980s, the influx of Central Americans made languages including Garifuna begin having a presence in Houston. The first feature film in the Garifuna language, \"Garifuna in Peril\", was released in 2012.\n\nThe Garinagu (singular \"Garifuna\") are a mix of West/Central African, Arawak, and Carib ancestry. Though they were captives removed from their homelands, these people were never documented as slaves. The two prevailing theories are that they were the survivors of two recorded shipwrecks or they somehow took over the ship on which they came. The more Western and Central African-looking people were transferred by the British from Saint Vincent to islands in the Bay of Honduras in 1796.\nTheir linguistic ancestors, Carib people, who gave their name to the Caribbean, once lived throughout the Lesser Antilles, and although their language is now extinct there, ethnic Caribs still live on Dominica, Trinidad, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent. The Caribs had conquered the previous population of the islands, Arawakan peoples like the Taino and Palikur peoples. During the conquest, which was conducted primarily by men, the Carib married Arawakan women. Children were raised by their mothers speaking Arawak, but as boys came of age, their fathers taught them Carib, a language still spoken in mainland South America. When European missionaries described the Island Carib people in the 17th century, they recorded two unrelated languages: Carib spoken by the men and Arawak spoken by the women. However, while the boys acquired Carib vocabulary, after a few generations, they retained the Arawakan grammar of their first language. Thus, Island Carib, as spoken by men, was genetically either a mixed language or a relexified language. Over the generations, men substituted fewer Arawak words, and many Carib words diffused to the women so the amount of distinctly male vocabulary diminished until both genders spoke Arawak, with an infusion of Carib vocabulary and distinct words in only a handful of cases.\n\nThe vocabulary of Garifuna is composed as follows:\n\nAlso, there also some few words from African languages.\n\nRelatively few examples of diglossia remain in common speech, and men and women use different words for the same concept such as ' for the pronoun \"I\". Most such words are rare and often dropped by men. For example, there are distinct Carib and Arawak words for 'man' and 'women', four words altogether, but in practice, the generic term ' \"person\" is used by both men and women and for both men and women, with grammatical gender agreement on a verb, adjective, or demonstrative, distinguishing whether ' refers to a man or to a woman (' \"the man\", \"\" \"the woman\").\n\nThere remains, however, a diglossic distinction in the grammatical gender of many inanimate nouns, with abstract words generally being considered grammatically feminine by men and grammatically masculine by women. Thus, the word \"\" may mean either concrete \"sun\" or abstract \"day\"; with the meaning of \"day\", most men use feminine agreement, at least in conservative speech, while women use masculine agreement. The equivalent of the abstract impersonal pronoun in phrases like \"it is necessary\" is also masculine for women but feminine in conservative male speech.\n\nWith independent personal pronouns, Garifuna distinguishes grammatical gender:\n\nThe forms \"au\" and \"amürü\" are of Cariban origin, and the others are of Arawakan origin.\n\nPluralization of nouns is irregular and is realized by means of suffixing:\n\n\nThe plural of \"Garífuna\" is \"Garínagu\".\n\nPossession on nouns is expressed by personal prefixes:\n\n\nFor the Garifuna verb, the grammatical tense, grammatical aspect, grammatical mood, negation, and person (both subject and object) are expressed by affixes, partly supported by particles.\n\nThe paradigms of grammatical conjugation are numerous.\n\nThe conjugation of the verb \"alîha\" \"to read\" in the present continuous tense:\n<br>\nThe conjugation of the verb \"alîha\" \"to read\" in the simple present tense:\n<br>\nThere are also some irregular verbs.\n\nFrom \"3\" upwards, the numbers of Garifuna are exclusively of French origin and are based on the vigesimal system, which, in today's French, is apparent at \"80\":\n\n\nThe use of French borrowings rather than Carib or Arawak terms is unclear, but may have to do with their succinctness, as numbers in indigenous American languages, especially those above ten, tend to be longer and more cumbersome.\n\n/o/ and /e/ are allophones of /ɔ/ and /ɛ/.\n\nThe language uses prepositions and conjunctions.\n\nThe word order is verb–subject–object (VSO).\n\n"}

Other names for the symbol include printer's fist, bishop's fist, digit, mutton-fist, hand, hand director, pointer, and pointing hand.\n\nThe symbol originates in scribal tradition of the medieval and Renaissance period, appearing in the margin of manuscripts to mark corrections or notes.\nManicules are first known to appear in the 12th century in handwritten manuscripts in Spain, and became common in the 14th and 15th centuries in Italy with some very elaborate with shading and artful cuffs. Some were playful and elaborate, but others were as simple as \"two squiggly strokes suggesting the barest sketch of a pointing hand\" and thus quick to draw.\n\nAfter the popularization of the printing press starting in the 1450s, the handwritten version continued in handwritten form as a means to annotate printed documents. \nEarly printers using a type representing the manicule included \nMathias Huss and Johannes Schabeler in Lyons in their 1484 edition of Paulus Florentinus' \"Breviarum totius juris canonici\".\n\nIn the modern period, the pointing hand became more popular in publications, advertising, and directional signage. Some fingerposts have relief-printed or even fully three-dimensional physical manifestations of pointing hands, The United States Postal Service has also used a pointing hand as a graphical indicator for its \"Return to Sender\" stamp.\n\nIn modern printing, it was used as a standard typographical symbol marking notes. The American \"Dictionary of Printing and Bookmaking\" (1894) treats it as the seventh in the standard sequence of footnote markers, following the paragraph sign (pilcrow).\n\nSherman (2005) argues that as the symbols became standardized, they were no longer reflective of individuality in comparison to other writing, and this explains their diminished popularity.\n\nThe typical use of the pointing hand is as a bullet-like symbol to direct the reader’s attention to important text, having roughly the same meaning as the word \"attention\" or \"note\". It is used this way both by annotators and printers. Even in the first few centuries of use, it can be seen used to draw attention to specific text, such as a title (in some cases in the form of a row of manicules), inserted text, noteworthy passage, or sententiae. In some cases, flower marks and asterisks were used for similar purposes. Less commonly, in earlier centuries the pointing hand acted as a section divider with a pilcrow as paragraph divider; or more rarely as the paragraph divider itself.\n\nSome encyclopedias use it in articles to cross-reference, as in ☞ other articles. \nIt occasionally sees use in magazines and comic books to indicate to the reader that a story on the right-hand page continues onto the next.\n\nIn linguistics, the symbol is used in optimality theory tableaux to identify the optimal output in a candidate of generated possibilities from a given input.\n\nAmerican science fiction writer Kurt Vonnegut used the symbol as a form of margin on the first line of every paragraph in his novel \"Breakfast of Champions\". The literary effect of this was to create separation between each paragraph, reinforcing the stream of consciousness style of the text.\n\nThomas Pynchon parodies this punctuation mark in his novel \"Gravity's Rainbow\" by depicting a middle finger, rather than an index finger, pointing at a line of text.\n\nAn upward pointing hand is often used in the mouse cursor in graphical user interfaces (such as those in Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop) to indicate an object that can be manipulated. \nThe first is believed to be the Xerox Star. Many web browsers use an upward pointing hand cursor to indicate a clickable hyperlink. CSS 2.0 allows the \"cursor\" property to be set to \"hand\" or \"pointer\" to intentionally change the mouse cursor to this symbol when hovering over an object; \"move\" may produce a closed fisted hand. \nMany video games made in the 1980s and '90s, primarily text-based adventure games, also used these cursors.\n\nUnicode (version 1.0, 1991) introduced six \"pointing index\" characters in the Miscellaneous Symbols block:\n\nUnicode 6.0 (2010) included several emoji pointing hands:\n\nUnicode 7.0 (2014) incorporated more indices from the Wingdings fonts.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17623209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17623209", "title": "Intensifier", "text": "Intensifier\n\nIntensifier (abbreviated ) is a linguistic term (but \"not\" a proper lexical category) for a modifier that makes no contribution to the propositional meaning of a clause but serves to enhance and give additional emotional context to the word it modifies. Intensifiers are grammatical expletives, specifically \"expletive attributives\" (or, equivalently, \"attributive expletives\" or \"attributive-only expletives\"; they also qualify as \"expressive attributives\"), because they function as semantically vacuous filler. Characteristically, English draws intensifiers from a class of words called \"degree modifiers\", words that quantify the idea they modify. More specifically, they derive from a group of words called \"adverbs of degree\", also known as \"degree adverbs\". However, when used grammatically as intensifiers, these words cease to be degree adverbs, because they no longer quantify the idea they modify; instead, they emphasize it emotionally. By contrast, the words \"\", \"\", and \"\" are degree adverbs, but \"not\" intensifiers. The other hallmark of prototypical intensifiers is that they are adverbs which lack the primary characteristic of adverbs: the ability to modify verbs. Intensifiers modify exclusively adjectives and adverbs. However, this rule is insufficient to classify intensifiers, since there exist other words commonly classified as adverbs that never modify verbs but are not intensifiers, e.g. \"\".\n\nFor these reasons, Huddleston argues that intensifier not be recognized as a primary grammatical or lexical category. Intensifier is a category with grammatical properties, but insufficiently defined unless its functional significance is also described (what Huddleston calls a \"notional definition\").\n\nTechnically, intensifiers roughly qualify a point on the affective semantic property, which is . Syntactically, intensifiers pre-modify either adjectives or adverbs. Semantically, they increase the emotional content of an expression. The basic intensifier is \"very\". A versatile word, English permits \"very\" to modify adjectives and adverbs, but not verbs. Other intensifiers often express the same intention as \"very\".\n\nNot all intensifiers are the same syntactically—they vary on whether they can be used attributively or predicatively. For example, \"really\" and \"super\" can be used in both ways:\n\nHowever, words such as \"so\" can only occur as predicative intensifiers while others, such as \"-ass\", typically are only attributive intensifiers:\n\nUse of an intensifier subtly suggests to the reader what emotion he should feel. By naming an emotion within the predicate, the writer compels the reader to consider this emotion and hence he begins to feel it.\n\nIn general, overuse of intensifiers negatively affects the persuasiveness or credibility of a legal argument. But if a judge's authoritative written opinion uses a high rate of intensifiers, a lawyer's written appeal of that opinion that also uses a high rate of intensifiers is associated with an increase in favorable outcomes for such appeals. Also, when judges disagree with each other in writing, they tend to use more intensifiers.\n\nA 2010 Stanford Graduate School of Business study found that, in quarterly earnings conference calls, deceptive CEOs use a greater percent quantity of “extreme positive emotions words” than CEOs telling the truth. This finding agrees with the presumption that a CEO attempting to hide poor performance exerts herself more forcefully to persuade her listeners. David F. Larcker and Zakolyukinaz give a list of 115 extreme positive emotions words, including intensifiers: awful, deucedly, emphatically, excellently, fabulously, fantastically, genuinely, gloriously, immensely, incredibly, insanely, keenly, madly, magnificently, marvelously, splendidly, supremely, terrifically, truly, unquestionably, wonderfully, very [good].\n\nA 2013 Forbes Magazine article about counterproductive modes of expression in English specifically discouraged use of \"really\", observing that it provokes doubt and degrades the speaker's credibility:\n\"Really\" - Finder calls this a \"poor attempt to instill candor and truthfulness\" that makes clients and coworkers question whether you're \"really\" telling the truth.\n\n\"The narrator\". It is easy to tell whether a narrator is narrating because the subject matter interests him or because he wants to evoke interest through his narrative. If the latter is the case, he will exaggerate, use superlatives, etc. Then he usually narrates the worse, because he is not thinking so much about the story as about himself.\nSubstitute 'damn' every time you're inclined to write 'very;' your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes referred to as a Jon Bar hinge or change-point.\n\nThe phrase is derived from the Jack Williamson novel \"The Legion of Time\" (serialized 1938, collected 1952). It refers to one action from its character John Barr, in which picking up one of two objects (a magnet and a pebble) is a major turning point in history: choosing one will lead to a utopian civilization named Jonbar, while the other to the tyranny of the state of Gyronchi.\n\nThis crucial moment (about which other characters are forewarned and must act), is thus a \"Jonbar point\" in the novel's timeline, a forking-place upon which hinges the rest of its history.\n\nJonbar hinges often refer to small non-descript events that had an important effect on history, but because of time travel the outcome of the choice or event was changed leading to a different future or an alternate history. It can, however, refer to any kind of change in history without having to deal with time travel, as Paul Di Filippo used the term when reviewing S. M. Stirling's \"In the Courts of the Crimson Kings\". In Michael Chabon's \"The Yiddish Policemen's Union\" the jonbar hinge was the death of the main opponent to the King-Havenner Bill, which, if passed, would have allowed Jewish refugees to settle in Alaska.

{"id": "5216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5216", "title": "Khmer language", "text": "Khmer language\n\nKhmer or Cambodian (natively \"phiəsaa khmae\" , or more formally \"kheemaʾraʾ phiəsaa\" ) is the language of the Khmer people and the official language of Cambodia. With approximately 16 million speakers, it is the second most widely spoken Austroasiatic language (after Vietnamese). Khmer has been influenced considerably by Sanskrit and Pali, especially in the royal and religious registers, through Hinduism and Buddhism. The more colloquial registers have influenced, and have been influenced by, Thai, Lao, Vietnamese, and Cham, all of which, due to geographical proximity and long-term cultural contact, form a sprachbund in peninsular Southeast Asia. It is also the earliest recorded and earliest written language of the Mon–Khmer family, predating Mon and by a significant margin Vietnamese, due to Old Khmer being the language of the historical empires of Chenla, Angkor and, presumably, their earlier predecessor state, Funan.\n\nThe vast majority of Khmer speakers speak Central Khmer, the dialect of the central plain where the Khmer are most heavily concentrated. Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that of the Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer. Outside of Cambodia, three distinct dialects are spoken by ethnic Khmers native to areas that were historically part of the Khmer Empire. The Northern Khmer dialect is spoken by over a million Khmers in the southern regions of Northeast Thailand and is treated by some linguists as a separate language. Khmer Krom, or Southern Khmer, is the first language of the Khmer of Vietnam while the Khmer living in the remote Cardamom mountains speak a very conservative dialect that still displays features of the Middle Khmer language.\n\nKhmer is primarily an analytic, isolating language. There are no inflections, conjugations or case endings. Instead, particles and auxiliary words are used to indicate grammatical relationships. General word order is subject–verb–object, and modifiers follow the word they modify. Classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like Chinese. In spoken Khmer, topic-comment structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.\n\nKhmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a tonal language. Words are stressed on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language has been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.\n\nKhmer is a member of the Austroasiatic language family, the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India. Austroasiatic, which also includes Mon, Vietnamese and Munda, has been studied since 1856 and was first proposed as a language family in 1907. Despite the amount of research, there is still doubt about the internal relationship of the languages of Austroasiatic. Diffloth places Khmer in an eastern branch of the Mon-Khmer languages. In these classification schemes Khmer's closest genetic relatives are the Bahnaric and Pearic languages. More recent classifications doubt the validity of the Mon-Khmer sub-grouping and place the Khmer language as its own branch of Austroasiatic equidistant from the other 12 branches of the family.\n\nKhmer is spoken by some 13 million people in Cambodia, where it is the official language. It is also a second language for most of the minority groups and indigenous hill tribes there. Additionally there are a million speakers of Khmer native to southern Vietnam (1999 census) and 1.4 million in northeast Thailand (2006).\n\nKhmer dialects, although mutually intelligible, are sometimes quite marked. Notable variations are found in speakers from Phnom Penh (Cambodia's capital city), the rural Battambang area, the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as Surin province, the Cardamom Mountains, and southern Vietnam. The dialects form a continuum running roughly north to south. Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a Khmer Krom speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native of Sisaket Province in Thailand.\n\nThe following is a classification scheme showing the development of the modern Khmer dialects.\n\nStandard Khmer, or Central Khmer, the language as taught in Cambodian schools and used by the media, is based on the dialect spoken throughout the Central Plain, a region encompassed by the northwest and central provinces.\n\nNorthern Khmer (called \"Khmer Surin\" in Khmer) refers to the dialects spoken by many in several border provinces of present-day northeast Thailand. After the fall of the Khmer Empire in the early 15th century, the Dongrek Mountains served as a natural border leaving the Khmer north of the mountains under the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of Lan Xang. The conquests of Cambodia by Naresuan the Great for Ayutthaya furthered their political and economic isolation from Cambodia proper, leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from the midpoint of the Middle Khmer period. This has resulted in a distinct accent influenced by the surrounding tonal languages Lao and Thai, lexical differences, and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants. Syllable-final , which has become silent in other dialects of Khmer, is still pronounced in Northern Khmer. Some linguists classify Northern Khmer as a separate but closely related language rather than a dialect.\n\nWestern Khmer, also called Cardamom Khmer or Chanthaburi Khmer, is spoken by a very small, isolated population in the Cardamom mountain range extending from western Cambodia into eastern Central Thailand. Although little studied, this variety is unique in that it maintains a definite system of vocal register that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern Khmer.\n\nPhnom Penh Khmer is spoken in the capital and surrounding areas. This dialect is characterized by merging or complete elision of syllables, which speakers from other regions consider a \"relaxed\" pronunciation. For instance, \"Phnom Penh\" is sometimes be shortened to \"m'Penh\". Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an \"r\" either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a consonant cluster (as in the English word \"bread\"). The \"r\", trilled or flapped in other dialects, is either pronounced as a uvular trill or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant, causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or \"dipping\" tone much like the \"hỏi\" tone in Vietnamese. For example, some people pronounce ('fish') as : the is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises, effectively doubling its length. Another example is the word ('study'), which is pronounced , with the uvular \"r\" and the same intonation described above.\n\nKhmer Krom or Southern Khmer is spoken by the indigenous Khmer population of the Mekong Delta, formerly controlled by the Khmer Empire but part of Vietnam since 1698. Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and, since the 1950s, have been forced to take Vietnamese names. Consequently, very little research has been published regarding this dialect. It has been generally influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from Standard Khmer.\n\nKhmer Khe is spoken in the Se San, Srepok and Sekong river valleys of Sesan and Siem Pang districts in Stung Treng Province. Following the decline of Angkor, the Khmer abandoned their northern territories, which the Lao then settled. In the 17th century, Chey Chetha XI led a Khmer force into Stung Treng to retake the area. The Khmer Khe living in this area of Stung Treng in modern times are presumed to be the descendants of this group. Their dialect is thought to resemble that of pre-modern Siem Reap.\n\nLinguistic study of the Khmer language divides its history into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian. Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the Khmer Empire from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following the end of the Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology, phonology and lexicon. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.\n\nThe following table shows the conventionally accepted historical stages of Khmer.\n\nJust as modern Khmer was emerging from the transitional period represented by Middle Khmer, Cambodia fell under the influence of French colonialism. Thailand, which had for centuries claimed suzerainty over Cambodia and controlled succession to the Cambodian throne, began losing its influence on the language. In 1887 Cambodia was fully integrated into French Indochina, which brought in a French-speaking aristocracy. This led to French becoming the language of higher education and the intellectual class. By 1907, the French had wrested over half of modern-day Cambodia, including the north and northwest where Thai had been the prestige language, back from Thai control and reintegrated it into the country.\n\nMany native scholars in the early 20th century, led by a monk named Chuon Nath, resisted the French and Thai influences on their language. Forming the government sponsored Cultural Committee to define and standardize the modern language, they championed Khmerization, purging of foreign elements, reviving affixation, and the use of Old Khmer roots and historical Pali and Sanskrit to coin new words for modern ideas. Opponents, led by Keng Vannsak, who embraced \"total Khmerization\" by denouncing the reversion to classical languages and favoring the use of contemporary colloquial Khmer for neologisms, and Ieu Koeus, who favored borrowing from Thai, were also influential. Koeus later joined the Cultural Committee and supported Nath. Nath's views and prolific work won out and he is credited with cultivating modern Khmer-language identity and culture, overseeing the translation of the entire Pali Buddhist canon into Khmer. He also created the modern Khmer language dictionary that is still in use today, thereby ensuring that Khmer would survive, and indeed flourish, during the French colonial period.\n\nThe phonological system described here is the inventory of sounds of the standard spoken language, represented using appropriate symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).\n\nThe voiceless plosives may occur with or without aspiration (as vs. , etc.); this difference is contrastive before a vowel. However, the aspirated sounds in that position may be analyzed as sequences of two phonemes: . This analysis is supported by the fact that infixes can be inserted between the stop and the aspiration; for example ('big') becomes ('size') with a nominalizing infix. When one of these plosives occurs initially before another consonant, aspiration is no longer contrastive and can be regarded as mere phonetic detail: slight aspiration is expected when the following consonant is not one of (or if the initial plosive is ).\n\nThe voiced plosives are pronounced as implosives by most speakers, but this feature is weak in educated speech, where they become .\n\nIn syllable-final position, and approach and respectively. The stops are unaspirated and have no audible release when occurring as syllable finals.\n\nIn addition, the consonants , , and occur occasionally in recent loan words in the speech of Cambodians familiar with French and other languages.\n\nVarious authors have proposed slightly different analyses of the Khmer vowel system. This may be in part because of the wide degree of variation in pronunciation between individual speakers, even within a dialectal region. The description below follows Huffman (1970). The number of vowel nuclei and their values vary between dialects; differences exist even between the Standard Khmer system and that of the Battambang dialect on which the standard is based.\n\nIn addition, some diphthongs and triphthongs are analyzed as a vowel nucleus plus a semivowel ( or ) coda because they can not be followed by a final consonant. These include: (with short monophthongs) , , , , ; (with long monophthongs) , ; (with long diphthongs) , , , , and .\n\nA Khmer syllable begins with a single consonant, or else with a cluster of two, or rarely three, consonants. The only possible clusters of three consonants at the start of a syllable are , and (with aspirated consonants analyzed as two-consonant sequences) . There are 85 possible two-consonant clusters (including [pʰ] etc. analyzed as /ph/ etc.). All the clusters are shown in the following table, phonetically, i.e. superscript ʰ can mark either contrastive or non-contrastive aspiration (see above).\n\nSlight vowel epenthesis occurs in the clusters consisting of a plosive followed by , in those beginning , and in the cluster .\n\nAfter the initial consonant or consonant cluster comes the syllabic nucleus, which is one of the vowels listed above. This vowel may end the syllable or may be followed by a coda, which is a single consonant. If the syllable is stressed and the vowel is short, there must be a final consonant. All consonant sounds except and the aspirates can appear as the coda (although final /r/ is heard in some dialects, most notably in Northern Khmer).\n\nA minor syllable (unstressed syllable preceding the main syllable of a word) has a structure of CV-, CrV-, CVN- or CrVN- (where C is a consonant, V a vowel, and N a nasal consonant). The vowels in such syllables are usually short; in conversation they may be reduced to , although in careful or formal speech, including on television and radio, they are clearly articulated. An example of such a word is \"mɔnuh, mɔnɨh, mĕəʾnuh\" ('person'), pronounced , or more casually .\n\nStress in Khmer falls on the final syllable of a word. Because of this predictable pattern, stress is non-phonemic in Khmer (it does not distinguish different meanings).\n\nMost Khmer words consist of either one or two syllables. In most native disyllabic words, the first syllable is a minor (fully unstressed) syllable. Such words have been described as \"sesquisyllabic\" (i.e. as having one-and-a-half syllables). There are also some disyllabic words in which the first syllable does not behave as a minor syllable, but takes secondary stress. Most such words are compounds, but some are single morphemes (generally loanwords). An example is ('language'), pronounced .\n\nWords with three or more syllables, if they are not compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are nonetheless adapted to Khmer stress patterns. Primary stress falls on the final syllable, with secondary stress on every second syllable from the end. Thus in a three-syllable word, the first syllable has secondary stress; in a four-syllable word, the second syllable has secondary stress; in a five-syllable word, the first and third syllables have secondary stress, and so on. Long polysyllables are not often used in conversation.\n\nCompounds, however, preserve the stress patterns of the constituent words. Thus , the name of a kind of cookie (literally 'bird's nest'), is pronounced , with secondary stress on the second rather than the first syllable, because it is composed of the words ('nest') and ('bird').\n\nKhmer once had a phonation distinction in its vowels, but this now survives only in the most archaic dialect (Western Khmer). The distinction arose historically when vowels after Old Khmer voiced consonants became breathy voiced and diphthongized; for example became . When consonant voicing was lost, the distinction was maintained by the vowel (); later the phonation disappeared as well (). These processes explain the origin of what are now called a-series and o-series consonants in the Khmer script.\n\nAlthough most Cambodian dialects are not tonal, colloquial Phnom Penh dialect has developed a tonal contrast (level versus peaking tone) as a by-product of the elision of . \n\nIntonation often conveys semantic context in Khmer, as in distinguishing declarative statements, questions and exclamations. The available grammatical means of making such distinctions are not always used, or may be ambiguous; for example, the final interrogative particle can also serve as an emphasizing (or in some cases negating) particle.\n\nThe intonation pattern of a typical Khmer declarative phrase is a steady rise throughout followed by an abrupt drop on the last syllable.\n\nOther intonation contours signify a different type of phrase such as the \"full doubt\" interrogative, similar to yes-no questions in English. Full doubt interrogatives remain fairly even in tone throughout, but rise sharply towards the end.\n\nExclamatory phrases follow the typical steadily rising pattern, but rise sharply on the last syllable instead of falling.\n\nKhmer is primarily an analytic language with no inflection. Syntactic relations are mainly determined by word order. Old and Middle Khmer used particles to mark grammatical categories and many of these have survived in Modern Khmer but are used sparingly, mostly in literary or formal language. Khmer makes extensive use of auxiliary verbs, \"directionals\" and serial verb construction. Colloquial Khmer is a zero copula language, instead preferring predicative adjectives (and even predicative nouns) unless using a copula for emphasis or to avoid ambiguity in more complex sentences. Basic word order is subject–verb–object (SVO), although subjects are often dropped; prepositions are used rather than postpositions. Topic-Comment constructions are common and the language is generally head-initial (modifiers follow the words they modify). Some grammatical processes are still not fully understood by western scholars. For example, it is not clear if certain features of Khmer grammar, such as actor nominalization, should be treated as a morphological process or a purely syntactic device, and some derivational morphology seems \"purely decorative\" and performs no known syntactic work.\n\nLexical categories have been hard to define in Khmer. Henri Maspero, an early scholar of Khmer, claimed the language had no parts of speech, while a later scholar, Judith Jacob, posited four parts of speech and innumerable particles. John Haiman, on the other hand, identifies \"a couple dozen\" parts of speech in Khmer with the caveat that Khmer words have the freedom to perform a variety of syntactic functions depending on such factors as word order, relevant particles, location within a clause, intonation and context. Some of the more important lexical categories and their function are demonstrated in the following example sentence taken from a hospital brochure:\n\nModern Khmer is an isolating language, which means that it uses little productive morphology. There is some derivation by means of prefixes and infixes, but this is a remnant of Old Khmer and not always productive in the modern language. Khmer morphology is evidence of a historical process through which the language was, at some point in the past, changed from being an agglutinative language to adopting an isolating typology. Affixed forms are lexicalized and cannot be used productively to form new words. Below are some of the most common affixes with examples as given by Huffman.\nCompounding in Khmer is a common derivational process that takes two forms, coordinate compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, one of the most productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning depends on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.\n\nCoordinate compounds:\n\nRepetitive compounds:\n\nKhmer nouns do not inflect for grammatical gender or singular/plural. There are no articles, but indefiniteness is often expressed by the word for \"one\" (, ) following the noun as in ( \"a dog\"). Plurality can be marked by postnominal particles, numerals, or reduplication of a following adjective, which, although similar to intensification, is usually not ambiguous due to context.\n\nClassifying particles are used after numerals, but are not always obligatory as they are in Thai or Chinese, for example, and are often dropped in colloquial speech. Khmer nouns are divided into two groups: mass nouns, which take classifiers; and specific, nouns, which do not. The overwhelming majority are mass nouns.\n\nPossession is colloquially expressed by word order. The possessor is placed after the thing that is possessed. Alternatively, in more complex sentences or when emphasis is required, a possessive construction using the word (, \"property, object\") may be employed. In formal and literary contexts, the possessive particle () is used:\n\nPronouns are subject to a complicated system of social register, the choice of pronoun depending on the perceived relationships between speaker, audience and referent (see Social registers below). Kinship terms, nicknames and proper names are often used as pronouns (including for the first person) among intimates. Subject pronouns are frequently dropped in colloquial conversation.\n\nAdjectives, verbs and verb phrases may be made into nouns by the use of nominalization particles. Three of the more common particles used to create nouns are , , and . These particles are prefixed most often to verbs to form abstract nouns. The latter, derived from Sanskrit, also occurs as a suffix in fixed forms borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali such as (\"health\") from (\"to be healthy\").\n\nAdjectives, demonstratives and numerals follow the noun they modify. Adverbs likewise follow the verb. Morphologically, adjectives and adverbs are not distinguished, with many words often serving either function. Adjectives are also employed as verbs as Khmer sentences rarely use a copula.\n\nDegrees of comparison are constructed syntactically. Comparatives are expressed using the word : \"A X [B]\" (A is more X [than B]). The most common way to express superlatives is with : \"A X \" (A is the most X). Intensity is also expressed syntactically, similar to other languages of the region, by reduplication or with the use of intensifiers.\n\nAs is typical of most East Asian languages, Khmer verbs do not inflect at all; tense, aspect and mood can be expressed using auxiliary verbs, particles (such as , placed before a verb to express continuous aspect) and adverbs (such as \"yesterday\", \"earlier\", \"tomorrow\"), or may be understood from context. Serial verb construction is quite common.\n\nKhmer verbs are a relatively open class and can be divided into two types, main verbs and auxiliary verbs. Huffman defined a Khmer verb as \"any word that can be (negated)\", and further divided main verbs into three classes.\n\nTransitive verbs are verbs that may be followed by a direct object:\n\nIntransitive verbs are verbs that can not be followed by an object:\n\nAdjectival verbs are a word class that has no equivalent in English. When modifying a noun or verb, they function as adjectives or adverbs, respectively, but they may also be used as main verbs equivalent to English \"be + \"adjective\"\".\n\nSyntax is the rules and processes that describe how sentences are formed in a particular language, how words relate to each other within clauses or phrases and how those phrases relate to each other within a sentence to convey meaning. Khmer syntax is very analytic. Relationships between words and phrases are signified primarily by word order supplemented with auxiliary verbs and, particularly in formal and literary registers, grammatical marking particles. Grammatical phenomena such as negation and aspect are marked by particles while interrogative sentences are marked either by particles or interrogative words equivalent to English \"wh-words\".\n\nA complete Khmer sentence consists of four basic elements—an optional topic, an optional subject, an obligatory predicate, and various adverbials and particles. The topic and subject are noun phrases, predicates are verb phrases and another noun phrase acting as an object or verbal attribute often follows the predicate.\n\nWhen combining these noun and verb phrases into a sentence the order is typically SVO:\n\nWhen both a direct object and indirect object are present without any grammatical markers, the preferred order is SV(DO)(IO). In such a case, if the direct object phrase contains multiple components, the indirect object immediately follows the noun of the direct object phrase and the direct object's modifiers follow the indirect object:\n\nThis ordering of objects can be changed and the meaning clarified with the inclusion of particles. The word , which normally means \"to arrive\" or \"towards\", can be used as a preposition meaning \"to\":\n\nAlternatively, the indirect object could precede the direct object if the object-marking preposition were used:\n\nHowever, in spoken discourse OSV is possible when emphasizing the object in a topic–comment-like structure.\n\nThe noun phrase in Khmer typically has the following structure:\nThe elements in parentheses are optional. Honorifics are a class of words that serve to index the social status of the referent. Honorifics can be kinship terms or personal names, both of which are often used as first and second person pronouns, or specialized words such as ('god') before royal and religious objects. The most common demonstratives are ('this, these') and ('that, those'). The word ('those over there') has a more distal or vague connotation. If the noun phrase contains a possessive adjective, it follows the noun and precedes the numeral. If a descriptive attribute co-occurs with a possessive, the possessive construction () is expected.\n\nSome examples of typical Khmer noun phrases are:\n\nThe Khmer particle marked attributes in Old Khmer noun phrases and is used in formal and literary language to signify that what precedes is the noun and what follows is the attribute. Modern usage may carry the connotation of mild intensity.\n\nKhmer verbs are completely uninflected, and once a subject or topic has been introduced or is clear from context the noun phrase may be dropped. Thus, the simplest possible sentence in Khmer consists of a single verb. For example, 'to go' on its own can mean \"I'm going.\", \"He went.\", \"They've gone.\", \"Let's go.\", etc. This also results in long strings of verbs such as:\n\nKhmer uses three verbs for what translates into English as the copula. The general copula is ; it is used to convey identity with nominal predicates. For locative predicates, the copula is . The verb is the \"existential\" copula meaning \"there is\" or \"there exists\".\n\nNegation is achieved by putting before the verb and the particle at the end of the sentence or clause. In colloquial speech, verbs can also be negated without the need for a final particle, by placing before them.\n\nPast tense can be conveyed by adverbs, such as \"yesterday\" or by the use of perfective particles such as \n\nDifferent senses of future action can also be expressed by the use of adverbs like \"tomorrow\" or by the future tense marker , which is placed immediately before the verb, or both:\n\nImperatives are often unmarked. For example, in addition to the meanings given above, the \"sentence\" can also mean \"Go!\". Various words and particles may be added to the verb to soften the command to varying degrees, including to the point of politeness (jussives):\n\nProhibitives take the form \" + \" and also are often softened by the addition of the particle to the end of the phrase.\n\nThere are three basic types of questions in Khmer. Questions requesting specific information use question words. Polar questions are indicated with interrogative particles, most commonly , a homonym of the negation particle. Tag questions are indicated with various particles and rising inflection. The SVO word order is generally not inverted for questions.\n\nIn more formal contexts and in polite speech, questions are also marked at their beginning by the particle .\n\nKhmer does not have a passive voice, but there is a construction utilizing the main verb (\"to hit\", \"to be correct\", \"to affect\") as an auxiliary verb meaning \"to be subject to\" or \"to undergo\"—which results in sentences that are translated to English using the passive voice.\n\nComplex sentences are formed in Khmer by the addition of one or more clauses to the main clause. The various types of clauses in Khmer include the coordinate clause, the relative clause and the subordinate clause. Word order in clauses is the same for that of the basic sentences described above. Coordinate clauses do not necessarily have to be marked; they can simply follow one another. When explicitly marked, they are joined by words similar to English conjunctions such as (\"and\") and (\"and then\") or by clause-final conjunction-like adverbs and , both of which can mean \"also\" or \"and also\"; disjunction is indicated by (\"or\"). Relative clauses can be introduced by (\"that\") but, similar to coordinate clauses, often simply follow the main clause. For example, both phrases below can mean \"the hospital bed that has wheels\".\n\nRelative clauses are more likely to be introduced with if they do not immediately follow the head noun. Khmer subordinate conjunctions always precede a subordinate clause. Subordinate conjunctions include words such as (\"because\"), (\"seems as if\") and (\"in order to\").\n\nCounting in Khmer is based on a biquinary system (the numbers from 6 to 9 have the form \"five one\", \"five two\", etc.) However, the words for multiples of ten from 30 to 90 are not related to the basic Khmer numbers, but are probably borrowed from Thai. Khmer numerals, which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than Western Arabic numerals. \n\nThe principal number words are listed in the following table, which gives Western and Khmer digits, Khmer spelling and IPA transcription.\n\nIntermediate numbers are formed by compounding the above elements. Powers of ten are denoted by loan words: (100), (1,000), (10,000), (100,000) and (1,000,000) from Thai and (10,000,000) from Sanskrit.\n\nOrdinal numbers are formed by placing the particle before the corresponding cardinal number.\n\nKhmer employs a system of registers in which the speaker must always be conscious of the social status of the person spoken to. The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for \"to eat\" used between intimates or in reference to animals is . Used in polite reference to commoners, it is . When used of those of higher social status, it is or . For monks the word is and for royals, . Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.\n\nKhmer is written with the Khmer script, an abugida developed from the Pallava script of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared. Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, above or below the consonant they follow, the Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to Thai and Lao, both of which were based on the Khmer system. The Khmer script is also distantly related to the Mon script, the ancestor of the modern Burmese script. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.\n\nConsonant symbols in Khmer are divided into two groups, or series. The first series carries the inherent vowel while the second series carries the inherent vowel . The Khmer names of the series, ('voiceless') and ('voiced'), respectively, indicate that the second series consonants were used to represent the voiced phonemes of Old Khmer. As the voicing of stops was lost, however, the contrast shifted to the phonation of the attached vowels, which, in turn, evolved into a simple difference of vowel quality, often by diphthongization. This process has resulted in the Khmer alphabet having two symbols for most consonant phonemes and each vowel symbol having two possible readings, depending on the series of the initial consonant:\n\n\n"}

In addition, the constitution recognizes the Arabic language as the language of Islam, giving it a formal status as the language of religion, and regulates its spreading within the Iranian national curriculum. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Arabic (as the language of Quran) became mandatory for pupils in Iran. Arabic courses are mandatory starting from 6th year of schooling (1st year of Middle School) until the 11th year (penultimate year of High School).\n\nThe local dialects of Arabic spoken by Arab minorities in Iran (like Ahwazi Arabs, Khamseh Arabs, Marsh Arabs as well as Arabs in Khorasan) are Khuzestani Arabic and Mesopotamian Arabic, (also known as Iraqi Arabic) mainly in Khuzestan Province as well as Khorasani Arabic especially in Khorasan Province.\n\nThere are several TV channels in Arabic language broadcasting from Iran, namely, Al-Alam, Al-Kawthar TV as well as IFilm.

The Arabic courses will be offered as an elective language course like German, French and English which are already being offered to elementary school students for a long time. According to a prepared curriculum, second and third graders will start learning the Arabic language by listening-comprehension and speaking, while introduction to writing will join these skills in fourth grade and after fifth grade students will start learning the language in all its four basic skills.\n\nAs of 2018, there are 4 independent countries where Arabic has a special status according to the constitution. The following is a list of sovereign states and territories where Arabic has a special status according to the constitution.\n\nThe constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran recognizes the Arabic language as the language of Islam, giving it a formal status as the language of religion, and regulates its spreading within the Iranian national curriculum. The constitution declares in Chapter II: (The Official Language, Script, Calendar, and Flag of the Country) in Article 16 \"\"Since the language of the Qur`an and Islamic texts and teachings is Arabic, ..., it must be taught after elementary level, in all classes of secondary school and in all areas of study.\"\n\nHistorically Arabic was the official language (in the territory which form nowadays the State of Israel) for around 1,382 years from 636 until 2018. The Knesset canceled Arabic as an official language and gave Arabic a special status of the country Israel by adopting the relevant Basic Law. The (an Israeli Basic Law which specifies the nature of the State of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish People) states in No. 4 (B) that \"The Arabic language has a special status in the state; Regulating the use of Arabic in state institutions or by them will be set in law.\" The law declares in No. 4 (C): \"This clause does not harm the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into effect.\"\" The law was adopted by the Knesset 62 in favor, 55 against and two abstentions on 19 July 2018.\n\nArabic is an indigenous language in the territory which form nowadays the state of Israel and which is still the lingua franca of Arab citizens of Israel as well as of Arab foreigners (especially Palestinians who have only a Palestinian Authority passport which is not recognized of many countries as these countries don`t recognize the State of Palestine why these Palestinians are seen as statelessness of many countries). In addition, Arabic is spoken of Arab Jews in Israel who immigrated from different Arab countries to Israel (as Aliyah) and got the Israeli citizenship according to the Israeli Nationality Law of 1952.\n\nHistorically Arabic was the official language (in the territory which form nowadays the state Islamic Republic of Pakistan) during the time when this region was a part of the Umayyad Caliphate between 651 and 750.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 the two languages Urdu (which is very close to Hindi, both also called Hindustani language which were two of the \"lingua franca\" of North India and Pakistan that time) as well as Bengali (at that time the lingua franca in the territory which is today the independent state Bangladesh) became the national languages in the new founded state Islamic Republic of Pakistan. General Ayub Khan the second President of Pakistan advocated the institution of Arabic language teaching a spart of national planning. \"Ayub`s educational plan emphasized Urdu and English as the primary language of Pakistan, but additionally recommended that Arabic be a secondary language of instruction along with English.\"\n\nThe Arabic language is mentioned in the constitution of Pakistan. It declares in article 31 No. 2 that \"The State shall endeavour, as respects the Muslims of Pakistan (a) to make the teaching of the Holy Quran and Islamiat compulsory, to encourage and facilitate the learning of Arabic language ...\"\n\nThere is also an Arab minority in Pakistan. In addition, a remarkable number of Pakistanis are able to speak Arabic as they were living in the rich GCC Countries for working reasons (in Saudi Arabia around 2.5 million; in UAE around 1.5 million; in Qatar around 650,000; in Kuwait around 430,000; in Oman around 300,000; in Bahrain around 180,000) for a very long time. These overseas Pakistanis who are living in countries of the Arab world are also named Arab Pakistanis or Pakistani Arabs.\n\nThe National Education Policy 2017 declares in article 3.7.4 that: “\"Arabic as compulsory part will be integrated in Islamiyat from Middle to Higher Secondary level to enable the students to understand the Holy Quran.\"“ Furthermore, it specifies in article 3.7.6: “\"Arabic as elective subject shall be offered properly at Secondary and Higher Secondary level with Arabic literature and grammar in its course to enable the learners to have command in the language.\"“ This law is also valid for private schools as it defines in article 3.7.12: “\"The curriculum in Islamiyat, Arabic and Moral Education of public sector will be adopted by the private institutions to make uniformity in the society.\"“\n\nThe Arabic language is mentioned in the Philippine constitution of 1986. It specifies that \"Spanish and Arabic shall be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis.\"\n\nArabic is mainly used by some Filipino Muslims in both a liturgical and instructional capacity since the arrival of Islam and establishment of several Sultanates (like Sultanate of Maguindanao, Sultanate of Sulu and Sultanate of Ranaw) in the present-day state Philippines. Along with Malay, Arabic was the \"lingua franca\" of the Malay Archipelago among Muslim traders and the Malay aristocracy in the history. Arabic is taught for free and is promoted in some Islamic centres predominantly in the southernmost parts of Philippines.\n\nAs of 2016, there are 9 non-sovereign entities where Arabic is an official language. The following is a list of non-sovereign entities and autonomous regions as well as territories where Arabic is an official or \"de facto\" official language.\n\nThe early Muslim conquests (, al-Futūḥāt al-Islāmiyya) and the following Expansion of Islam (, Intishar al-Islām) led to the expansion of the Arabic language in Northern Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, the Caucasus, Western Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. Along with the religion of Islam, the Arabic language, Arabic number system and Arab customs spread throughout the entire Arab caliphate. The caliphs of the Arab dynasty established the first schools inside the empire which taught Arabic language and Islamic studies for all pupils in all areas within the caliphate. The result was (in those areas which belonged to the Arab empire) the creation of the society that was mostly Arabic-speaking because of the assimilation of native inhabitants.\n\nDuring the period of the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750), the 5th Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (646–705) established Arabic instead of the local languages as the sole official state language of government across the entire caliphate.\n\nWhile the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258) originally gained power by exploiting the social inequalities against non-Arabs in the Umayyad Empire, during Abbasid rule the empire rapidly was Arabized. As knowledge was shared in the Arabic language throughout the empire, people of different nationalities and religions began gradually to speak Arabic in their everyday lives. Resources from other languages began to be translated into Arabic, and a unique Islamic identity began to form that fused previous cultures with Arab culture, creating a level of civilization and knowledge that was considered a marvel in Europe and the Western world.\n\nThe Arabic language remained the lingua franca of high culture under the Fatimids (909–1171), Spanish Umayyads (856–1031) in the Iberian Peninsula, and later Muslim dynasties in North Africa and Spain and of the Mamluks (1250–1517) in Egypt and Syria-Palestine.\n\nIn the history, Andalusian Arabic was the official language in Spain and Portugal, formerly Al-Andalus for more than 700 years until the fall of the last Islamic state in Iberia at Granada in 1492.\n\nSiculo-Arabic (or Sicilian Arabic) was a spoken language on the islands of Sicily and neighbouring Malta (at that time Emirate of Sicily (831–1091)) between the end of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century.\n\nFurthermore, a form of Arabic was spoken on the Mediterranean island of Crete (in those days Emirate of Crete) from the late 820s (c. 824 or 827/828) until the Byzantine reconquest in 961.\n\nArabic (alongside English) was an official language in South Sudan from 1863 (these days a part of Egypt Eyalet (1517–1867)) until 2011 (that time the independent state Republic of South Sudan), when the former government canceled Arabic as an official language. Since 2011 English is the sole official language of South Sudan. The Arabic dialect Juba Arabic is still the lingua franca of the people in South Sudan.\n\nIn 2014, Gambian president Yahya Jammeh announced that The Gambia would drop English as the official language because it is a \"colonial relic\". He replaced Gambia’s official language English with Arabic in 2014. However, such change was not enacted.\n\nHistorically Arabic was the official language (in the territory which form nowadays the State of Israel) for around 1,382 years. The Arabic language was spread with the Muslim conquest of the Levant (which took place between 634 and 638) and became the official language in the territory of Jund Filastin (which was a part of the Rashidun Caliphate at that time). Arabic remained as the official language in this area during the time of different Muslim dynasties which control this territory for several centuries, namely Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate, Mamluk Sultanate, Damascus Eyalet (an eyalet of the Ottoman Empire), Syria Vilayet (a first-level administrative division (vilayet) of the Ottoman Empire), Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem (an Ottoman district with special administrative status) as well as during the time when this territory came under the control of the British Empire (known as Occupied Enemy Territory Administration) and the following geopolitical entity Mandatory Palestine.\n\nThe Arabic language (alongside Hebrew) also remained as an official language in the State of Israel for the first 70 years after the proclamation in 1948 until 2018. The Knesset canceled the status of Arabic as an official language by adopting the relevant on 19 July 2018. This Israeli Basic Law states in No. 4 (A) that \"The state’s language is Hebrew.\"\n\nThere were several territories (which later became independent states) where Arabic was an official or \"de facto\" official language and where it has been replaced by other languages or repealed. The following is a list of territories (which later became independent states) where Arabic was an official or \"de facto\" official language in the history.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9672081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9672081", "title": "Mal Paharia language", "text": "Mal Paharia language\n\nMal Paharia is a language spoken by 51,000 of 110,000 ethnic Mal Paharia in the states of Jharkhand and West Bengal in India, and regions of Bangladesh. The language is also known as Mal Pahoria, Malto, Malti, Paharia, Parsi, and Mal Pahariya. It has been variously regarded as a Bengali–Assamese language, a dialect of Malto, and a mixed Dravidian–Indo-Aryan language. There is a generally positive attitude among speakers of the language towards it, but it is considered vulnerable as some speakers have shifted to Bengali. Mal Paharia uses the Devanagari script and rules for its writing/ reading/ speech.\n\nMal Paharia is classified under the Indo-European, Indo- Iranian, Indo- Aryna and Eastern Zone language groups.\n\nMal Paharia is derived from Malto and the Bengali language. The speakers of this language originated in Jharkhand as early as 1881, and since then it has declined in popularity. According to the 1921 census, the town had Indo-European 500 speakers at that time. Industrialization and urbanization were factors in the fragmentation of the Bengali language into dialects because of the making of dams, mines, homes, and more. This caused a displacement in the population of the Indo-European speakers, which led to the emergence of Mal Paharia.\n\nMal Paharia is considered a Northern Dravidian language, which is spoken in Northeastern India.\n\nOfficial status\nThe regions that use Mal Pahari are Jharkhand, West Bengal, and parts of Bangladesh.\n\nDialects/ Varieties \nMal Paharia can be considered a dialect of Benjali but can also be classified separately. It is also derived from Malto, which is a more commonly used language. Mal Paharia is considered a Dravidian language, which is spoken by the people of Jharkhand and in Bangladesh.\n\nDerived Languages\nMal Paharia does not have any daughter languages, only languages that are similar to it such as Kumarbhag Paharia and Sauria Paharia.\n\nMal Paharia uses the Devangari script, and in the chart there are a few examples of words in writing, and translated in English. The Devangari script has 11 vowels and 33 consonants. The script is written from left to right, and it uses headstrokes on the letters. Some exceptions are; jha, tha, dha, bha, a and ā, because there is a break in the headstroke. While writing using the Devangari script, the headstroke is not always used. According to the phonetics used in Devangari script for the Mal Paharia language, vowels are ordered first, meaning each short vowel is following by a longer one. The consonants are ordered with respect to place and in rows. The 'rows' consist of; velar, palatal, retroflex, dental, labial. Each row has different rules, but within each one, the sibilants and fricatives are ordered last. Various letters take different forms when they are in their initial/ final position. For example, the letter \"ra\" changes location depending on the preceding \"ya\", or a consonant other than \"ya\", or a consonant with a vertical stem/ rounded bottom.\n\nSince Devanagari is not actually an alphabet, it uses an \"alphasyllabary\" system using vowels and consonants to form speech. Every letter represents a consonant, which is followed by a schwa vowel (अ). Diatrical marks are used to distinguish between different sounds of the vowels, since it can be used in many different ways. Conjunct consonants are used to represent combinations of sounds, thus increasing its versatility in word formation.\n\nDevanagari uses the articulation of vowels in the mouth, when spoken. It uses five places of articulation listed in the chart below: \nAmong all of the consonants and vowels, they are voiced, unvoiced, or nasal. An example is given (in the chart below) for the Devangari script with relation to the five articulation of vowels in the mouth. \nMal Paharia is identified as a Bengali–Assamese language, which uses the Devanagri script to form vocabulary. It is a borrowed script, since it does not have its own type of script, so the Devanagari script is shared by speakers in the Northeastern area of India and Bangladesh.\n\nThis YouTube video serves as a short example of the spoken Mal Paharia language.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B9JCWHGP8U\n\n"}

Emerging from this terminology came the \"minor premiership\", for the top-ranked team in the minor rounds, and the \"major premiership\", often shortened simply to premiership, for the winner of the finals series.\n\nThe term was important in the early finals systems of the Victorian Football League, an Australian rules football league, where the minor premier had the right to a challenge match for the major premiership if it were eliminated at any stage during the finals.\n\nThe term is used widely throughout Australian sports, and there is often a separate trophy presented for it. The National Rugby League awards the J. J. Giltinan Shield, the Australian Ice Hockey League awards the H. Newman Reid Trophy and the Australian Football League has (since 1991) awarded the Dr Wm. C. McClelland Trophy. The National Basketball League recognises the minor premiers but no official trophy or award is given. Australia's premier association football competition, the A-League, officially refers to the \"minor premiership\" as the \"premiership\", and the \"major premiership\" as the \"championship\", which is more common with other association football competitions, but \"minor premiership\" is still used colloquially in the sports media even though it is incorrect terminology with regard to the A-League.\n\nAlthough the concept of a minor premiership exists in North America, and a separate award is often presented for the best record in the regular season, the term \"minor premiership\" is not used. The Presidents' Trophy is awarded by the National Hockey League to the team which finishes first in the standings at the end of the season, as are the Supporters' Shield in Major League Soccer and the NWSL Shield in the National Women's Soccer League.\n"}

{"id": "66012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66012", "title": "Newcomb's paradox", "text": "Newcomb's paradox\n\nIn philosophy and mathematics, Newcomb's paradox, also referred to as Newcomb's problem, is a thought experiment involving a game between two players, one of whom purports to be able to predict the future. Whether the problem actually is a paradox is disputed.\n\nNewcomb's paradox was created by William Newcomb of the University of California's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. However, it was first analyzed and was published in a philosophy paper spread to the philosophical community by Robert Nozick in 1969, and appeared in the March 1973 issue of Scientific American, in Martin Gardner's \"Mathematical Games.\" Today it is a much debated problem in the philosophical branch of decision theory.\n\nThere is a predictor, a player, and two boxes designated A and B. The player is given a choice between taking only box B, or taking both boxes A and B. The player knows the following:\nEven while the player knows the above, he does not know what prediction has been made prior to his making a choice.\n\nIn his 1969 article, Nozick noted that \"To almost everyone, it is perfectly clear and obvious what should be done. The difficulty is that these people seem to divide almost evenly on the problem, with large numbers thinking that the opposing half is just being silly.\" The problem continues to divide philosophers today.\n\nGame theory offers two strategies for this game that rely on different principles: the expected utility principle and the strategic dominance principle. The problem is called a \"paradox\" because two analyses that both sound intuitively logical give conflicting answers to the question of what choice maximizes the player's payout.\n\nDavid Wolpert and Gregory Benford suggest that there is no conflict between the two strategies; Newcomb's problem actually represents two different games with different probabilistic outcomes, and the conflict arises because of this imprecise definition of the game. They also note that the optimal strategy for either of the games does not depend on the infallibility of the predictor, and the questions of causality, determinism, and free will do not factor into these strategies.\n\nCausality issues arise when the predictor is posited as infallible and incapable of error; Nozick avoids this issue by positing that the predictor's predictions are \"\"almost\" certainly\" correct, thus sidestepping any issues of infallibility and causality. Nozick also stipulates that if the predictor predicts that the player will choose randomly, then box B will contain nothing. This assumes that inherently random or unpredictable events would not come into play anyway during the process of making the choice, such as free will or quantum mind processes. However, these issues can still be explored in the case of an infallible predictor. Under this condition, it seems that taking only B is the correct option. This analysis argues that we can ignore the possibilities that return $0 and $1,001,000, as they both require that the predictor has made an incorrect prediction, and the problem states that the predictor is never wrong. Thus, the choice becomes whether to take both boxes with $1,000 or to take only box B with $1,000,000—so taking only box B is always better.\n\nWilliam Lane Craig has suggested that, in a world with perfect predictors (or time machines, because a time machine could be used as a mechanism for making a prediction), retrocausality can occur. If a person truly knows the future, and that knowledge affects their actions, then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. The chooser's choice will have already \"caused\" the predictor's action. Some have concluded that if time machines or perfect predictors can exist, then there can be no free will and choosers will do whatever they're fated to do. Taken together, the paradox is a restatement of the old contention that free will and determinism are incompatible, since determinism enables the existence of perfect predictors. Put another way, this paradox can be equivalent to the grandfather paradox; the paradox presupposes a perfect predictor, implying the \"chooser\" is not free to choose, yet simultaneously presumes a choice can be debated and decided. This suggests to some that the paradox is an artifact of these contradictory assumptions.\n\nGary Drescher argues in his book \"Good and Real\" that the correct decision is to take only box B, by appealing to a situation he argues is analogous—a rational agent in a deterministic universe deciding whether or not to cross a potentially busy street.\n\nAndrew Irvine argues that the problem is structurally isomorphic to Braess' paradox, a non-intuitive but ultimately non-paradoxical result concerning equilibrium points in physical systems of various kinds.\n\nSimon Burgess has argued that we need to recognize two stages to the problem. The first stage is that before which the predictor has gained all the information on which the prediction will be based. If, for example, we suppose that the prediction is at least partially based on a brain scan of the player then the first stage will not be over at least until that brain scan has been taken. An important point to appreciate is that while the player is still in that first stage, they will presumably be able to influence the predictor's prediction (e.g., by committing to taking only one box). The second stage commences after the completion of the brain scan (and/or after the gathering of any other information on which the prediction is based). As Burgess points out, the first stage is the one in which all of us currently find ourselves. Moreover, there is a clear sense in which the first stage is more significant than the second because it is then that the player can determine whether the $1,000,000 is in box B. Once they get to the second stage, the best that can be done is to determine whether to get the $1,000 in box A.\n\nThose persuaded by Burgess's approach do not say either that it is simply rational to take just box B or that it is conversely rational to take both boxes, but\nrather argue a player should make their decision while in the first stage and that that decision should be to commit to only box B. Once in the second stage, the rational decision would be to take both boxes, although by that stage the player should already have made up their mind to take just box B. Burgess has repeatedly emphasized that he is not arguing that the player should change their mind on getting to the second stage. The safe and rational strategy to adopt is to simply make a commitment to just box B while in the first stage and to have no intention of wavering from that commitment, i.e., make an 'unqualified resolution'. Burgess points out that those who make no such commitment and therefore miss out on the $1,000,000 have simply failed to be prepared. In a more recent paper Burgess has explained that, given his analysis, Newcomb's problem should be seen as being akin to the toxin puzzle. This is because both problems highlight the fact that one can have a reason to intend to do something without having a reason to actually do it.\n\nWith regard to causal structure, Burgess has consistently followed Ellery Eells and others in treating Newcomb's problem as a common cause problem. Contrary to David Lewis, he argues against the idea that Newcomb's problem is another version of the prisoner's dilemma. Burgess's argument on this point emphasizes the contrasting causal structures of the two problems.\n\nNewcomb's paradox can also be related to the question of machine consciousness, specifically if a perfect simulation of a person's brain will generate the consciousness of that person. Suppose we take the predictor to be a machine that arrives at its prediction by simulating the brain of the chooser when confronted with the problem of which box to choose. If that simulation generates the consciousness of the chooser, then the chooser cannot tell whether they are standing in front of the boxes in the real world or in the virtual world generated by the simulation in the past. The \"virtual\" chooser would thus tell the predictor which choice the \"real\" chooser is going to make.\n\nNewcomb's paradox is related to logical fatalism in that they both suppose absolute certainty of the future. In logical fatalism, this assumption of certainty creates circular reasoning (\"a future event is certain to happen, therefore it is certain to happen\"), while Newcomb's paradox considers whether the participants of its game are able to affect a predestined outcome.\n\nMany thought experiments similar to or based on Newcomb's problem have been discussed in the literature. For example, a quantum-theoretical version of Newcomb's problem in which box B is entangled with box A has been proposed.\n\nAnother related problem is the meta-Newcomb problem. The setup of this problem is similar to the original Newcomb problem. However, the twist here is that the predictor may elect to decide whether to fill box B after the player has made a choice, and the player does not know whether box B has already been filled. There is also another predictor: a \"meta-predictor\" who has correctly predicted \"every\" outcome in the past, and who predicts the following: \"Either you will choose both boxes, and the predictor will make its decision after you, or you will choose only box B, and the predictor will already have made its decision.\"\n\nIn this situation, a proponent of choosing both boxes is faced with the following dilemma: if the player chooses both boxes, the predictor will not yet have made its decision, and therefore a more rational choice would be for the player to choose box B only. But if the player so chooses, the predictor will already have made its decision, making it impossible for the player's decision to affect the predictor's decision.\n\n"}

It initially was restricted to literary activities in Karachi. However, envied by the circles it soon multiplied to have branches all over Sindh and has now branches oversees as well.\n\nIn 1952, Noor-ud-din Sarki and Abdul Ghafoor Ansari restructured the literary forum of Sindhi language and called it Sindhi Adabi Sangat. Initially its activities were confined to the city of Karachi. Inspired by the success of its activities in Karachi, interest developed over the rest of Sindh. This led to the launch of other branches in other parts of Sindh as well.\n\nRealizing the growing popularity of Sindhi Adabi Sangat, it was invited for the first time as a group in the 'Eighteenth Sindhi Adabi Conference' in April 1956 at Larkana by Jamait-ul-shoora-e-Sindh.

Ideally, any project that follows the Tango guidelines will have a look and feel that matches well with other icons and applications that follow the guidelines.\n\nThe style does not aim to be visually unique to distinguish itself. Instead, a secondary aim of the project is to create a standard style that makes applications look appropriate running on operating systems common at that time, such that ISVs will find that their application does not look out of place on Windows XP, Mac OS X, KDE, GNOME, or Xfce.\n\nApart from the visual guidelines, the project aims to provide a set of common metaphors for the icons. Tango follows the Freedesktop.org's Standard Icon Theming Specification and actively develops the Freedesktop.org's Standard Icon Naming Specification, defining names for the most common icons and the used metaphors.\n\nMany free software projects, such as GIMP, Scribus, and GNOME, have started to follow the Tango style guidelines for their icons.
