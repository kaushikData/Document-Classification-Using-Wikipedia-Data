{"id": "4647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4647", "title": "Breton language", "text": "Breton language\n\nBreton (; or in Morbihan) is a Southwestern Brittonic Celtic language spoken in Brittany.\n\nBreton was brought from Great Britain to Armorica by migrating Britons during the Early Middle Ages; it is thus an Insular Celtic language, and as such not closely related to the Continental Celtic Gaulish language which had been spoken in pre-Roman Gaul. Breton is most closely related to Cornish, both being Southwestern Brittonic languages. Welsh and the extinct Cumbric are the more distantly related Western Brittonic languages. Due to pressure from French, Breton phonology is closer to that of French than to its relatives in Britain.\n\nThe other regional language of Brittany, Gallo, is a langue d'oïl. Gallo is consequently close to French, although not mutually intelligible, and a Romance language descended from Latin (unlike the similarly named ancient Celtic language Gaulish).\n\nHaving declined from more than 1,000,000 speakers around 1950 to about 200,000 in the first decade of the 21st century, Breton is classified as \"severely endangered\" by the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger. However, the number of children attending bilingual classes has risen 33% between 2006 and 2012 to 14,709.\n\nBreton is spoken in Lower Brittany (), roughly to the west of a line linking Plouha (west of Saint-Brieuc) and La Roche-Bernard (east of Vannes). It comes from a Brittonic language community that once extended from Great Britain to Armorica (present-day Brittany) and had even established a toehold in Galicia (in present-day Spain). Old Breton is attested from the 9th century. It was the language of the upper classes until the 12th century, after which it became the language of commoners in Lower Brittany. The nobility, followed by the bourgeoisie, adopted French. The written language of the Duchy of Brittany was Latin, switching to French in the 15th century. There exists a limited tradition of Breton literature. Some Old Breton vocabulary remains in the present day as philosophical and scientific terms in Modern Breton. The recognized stages of the Breton language are: Old Breton - c.800 to c.1100, Middle Breton - c.1100 to c.1650, Modern Breton - c.1650 to present.\n\nThe French monarchy was not concerned with the minority languages of France spoken by the lower classes, and required the use of French for government business as part of its policy of national unity. During the French Revolution, the government introduced policies favouring French over the regional languages, which it pejoratively referred to as . The revolutionaries assumed that reactionary and monarchist forces preferred regional languages to try to keep the peasant masses underinformed. In 1794, Bertrand Barère submitted his \"report on the \" to the Committee of Public Safety in which he said that \"federalism and superstition speak Breton\".\n\nSince the 19th century, under the Third, Fourth and Fifth Republics, the government has attempted to stamp out minority languages, including Breton, in state schools, in an effort to build a national culture. Teachers humiliated students for using their regional languages, and such practices prevailed until the late 1960s.\n\nIn the early 21st century, due to the political centralization of France, the influence of the media, and the increasing mobility of people, only about 200,000 people can speak Breton, a dramatic decline from more than a million in 1950. The majority of today's speakers are more than 60 years old, and Breton is now classified as an endangered language.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, half of the population of Lower Brittany knew only Breton; the other half were bilingual. By 1950, there were only 100,000 monolingual Bretons, and this rapid decline has continued, with likely no monolingual speakers left today. A statistical survey in 1997 found around 300,000 speakers in Lower Brittany, of whom about 190,000 were aged 60 or older. Few 15- to 19-year-olds spoke Breton.\n\nIn 1925, Professor Roparz Hemon founded the Breton-language review \"Gwalarn.\" During its 19-year run, \"Gwalarn\" tried to raise the language to the level of a great international language. Its publication encouraged the creation of original literature in all genres, and proposed Breton translations of internationally recognized foreign works. In 1946, \"Al Liamm\" replaced \"Gwalarn\". Other Breton-language periodicals have been published, which established a fairly large body of literature for a minority language.\n\nIn 1977, Diwan schools were founded to teach Breton by immersion. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. See the education section for more information.\n\nThe \"Asterix\" comic series has been translated into Breton. According to the comic, the Gaulish village where Asterix lives is in the Armorica peninsula, which is now Brittany. Some other popular comics have also been translated into Breton, including \"The Adventures of Tintin\", \"Spirou\", \"Titeuf\", \"Hägar the Horrible\", \"Peanuts\" and \"Yakari\".\n\nSome original media are created in Breton. The sitcom, \"Ken Tuch\", is in Breton. Radio Kerne, broadcasting from Finistère, has exclusively Breton programming. Some movies (\"Lancelot du Lac\", \"Shakespeare in Love\", \"Marion du Faouet\", \"Sezneg\") and TV series (\"Columbo\", \"Perry Mason\") have also been translated and broadcast in Breton. Poets, singers, linguists, and writers who have written in Breton, including Yann-Ber Kalloc'h, Roparz Hemon, Anjela Duval, Xavier de Langlais, Pêr-Jakez Helias, Youenn Gwernig, Glenmor and Alan Stivell are now known internationally.\n\nToday, Breton is the only living Celtic language that is not recognized by a national government as an official or regional language.\n\nThe first Breton dictionary, the \"Catholicon\", was also the first French dictionary. Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today bilingual dictionaries have been published for Breton and languages including English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh. A new generation is determined to gain international recognition for Breton. The monolingual dictionary, (1995), defines Breton words in Breton. The first edition contained about 10,000 words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20,000 words.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the (\"Office of the Breton language\") began a campaign to encourage daily use of Breton in the region by both businesses and local communes. Efforts include installing bilingual signs and posters for regional events, as well as encouraging the use of the Spilhennig to let speakers identify each other. The office also started an Internationalization and localization policy asking Google, Firefox and SPIP to develop their interfaces in Breton. In 2004, the Breton Wikipedia started, which now counts more than 65,000 articles. In March 2007, the \"Ofis ar Brezhoneg\" signed a tripartite agreement with Regional Council of Brittany and Microsoft for the consideration of the Breton language in Microsoft products. In October 2014, Facebook added Breton as one of its 121 languages. after three years of talks between the \"Ofis\" and Facebook.\n\nBreton is spoken mainly in Lower Brittany, but also in a more dispersed way in Upper Brittany (where Gallo is spoken alongside Breton and French), and in areas around the world that have Breton emigrants.\n\nThe four traditional dialects of Breton correspond to medieval bishoprics rather than to linguistic divisions. They are (, of the county of Léon), (, of Trégor), (, of ), and (, of Vannes). was spoken up to the beginning of the 20th century in the region of Guérande and Batz-sur-Mer. There are no clear boundaries between the dialects because they form a dialect continuum, varying only slightly from one village to the next. , however, is almost mutually unintelligible with most of the other dialects.\n\nAs noted, only French is an official language of France. Supporters of Breton and other minority languages continue to argue for their recognition, education in public schools and place in public life.\n\nIn July 2008, the legislature amended the French Constitution, adding article 75-1: (the regional languages belong to the heritage of France).\n\nThe European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which obliges signatory states to recognize minority and regional languages, was signed by France in 1999 but has not been ratified. On 27 October 2015, the Senate rejected a draft constitutional law ratifying the charter.\n\nRegional and departmental authorities use Breton to a very limited extent, for example in signage. Some bilingual signage has also been installed, such as street name signs in Breton towns. One station of the Rennes metro system has signs in both French and Breton.\n\nUnder the French law known as Toubon, it is illegal for commercial signage to be in Breton alone. Signs must be bilingual or French only. Since commercial signage usually has limited physical space, most businesses have signs only in French.\n\n, the Breton language agency, was set up in 1999 by the Brittany region to promote and develop the daily use of Breton. It created the campaign, to encourage enterprises, organisations and communes to promote the use of Breton, for example by installing bilingual signage or translating their websites into Breton.\n\nIn the late 20th century, the French government considered incorporating the independent Breton-language immersion schools (called ) into the state education system. This action was blocked by the French Constitutional Council based on the 1994 amendment to the Constitution that establishes French as the language of the republic. Therefore, no other language may be used as a language of instruction in state schools. The Toubon Law implemented the amendment, asserting that French is the language of public education.\n\nThe Diwan schools were founded in Brittany in 1977 to teach Breton by immersion. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. They have gained fame owing to their high level of results in school exams. Breton-language schools do not receive funding from the national government, though the Brittany Region may fund them.\n\nAnother teaching method is a bilingual approach by (\"Two Languages\") in the State schools, created in 1979. (\"Awakening\") was created in 1990 for bilingual education in the Catholic schools.\n\nIn 2018, 18,337 pupils (about 2.00% of all pupils in Brittany) attended Diwan, Div Yezh and Dihun schools. Their number has increased yearly. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the president of the Regional Council, had a goal of 20,000 pupils by 2010, but is encouraged by their progress.\n\nIn 2007, some 4,500 to 5,000 adults followed a Breton language course (such as evening course, correspondence, or other). The family transmission of Breton in 1999 is estimated to be 3 percent.\n\nGrowth of the percentage of pupils in bilingual education.\nPercentage of pupils in bilingual education per department.\n\nThe 10 communes with the highest percentage of pupils in bilingual primary education, listed with their total population.\nThe 10 communes of historic Brittany with the highest total population, listed with their percentages of pupils in bilingual primary education.\n\nIn addition to bilingual education (including Breton-medium education) the region has introduced the Breton language in primary education, mainly in the department of Finistère. These \"initiation\" sessions are generally one to three hours per week, and consist of songs and games.\n\nSchools in secondary education (\"collèges\" and \"lycées\") offer some courses in Breton. In 2010, nearly 5,000 students in Brittany were reported to be taking this option. Additionally, the University of Rennes 2 has a Breton language department offering courses in the language along with a master's degree in Breton and Celtic Studies.\n\nVowels in Breton may be short or long. All unstressed vowels are short; stressed vowels can be short or long (vowel lengths are not noted in usual orthographies as they are implicit in the phonology of particular dialects, and not all dialects pronounce stressed vowels as long).\n\nAll vowels can also be nasalized, which is noted by appending an 'n' letter after the base vowel, or by adding a combining tilde above the vowel (most commonly and easily done for \"a\" and \"o\" due to the Portuguese letters), or more commonly by non-ambiguously appending an letter after the base vowel (this depends on the orthographic variant).\nDiphthongs are .\n\n\nAs in English as well as the other Celtic languages, a variety of verbal constructions are available to express grammatical aspect, for example: showing a distinction between progressive and habitual actions:\n\nAs in other modern Celtic languages, Breton pronouns are fused into preceding prepositions to produce a sort of \"conjugated\" preposition. Below are some examples in Breton, Cornish, Welsh, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx, along with English translations.\nNote that in the examples above the Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx) use the preposition meaning \"at\" to show possession, whereas the Brittonic languages use \"with\". The Goidelic languages, however, do use the preposition \"with\" to express \"belong to\" (Irish , Scottish , Manx , The book belongs to me).\n\nNote also that the above examples of Welsh are the formal written language. The order and preposition may differ slightly in colloquial Welsh (Formal , North Wales , South Wales ).\n\nBreton has four initial consonant mutations: though modern Breton lost the nasal mutation of Welsh, it also has a \"hard\" mutation, in which voiced stops become voiceless, and a \"mixed\" mutation, which is a mixture of hard and soft mutations.\n\nThe English words and have been borrowed from French, which took them from Breton. However, this is uncertain: for instance, \"menhir\" is \"peulvan\" or \"maen hir\" (\"long stone\"), \"maen sav\" (\"straight stone\") (two words: noun + adjective) in Breton. \"Dolmen\" is a misconstructed word (it should be \"taol-vaen\"). Some studies state that these words were borrowed from Cornish. can be directly translated from Welsh as \"long stone\" (which is exactly what a or is). The Cornish surnames Mennear, Minear and Manhire all derive from the Cornish \" \" (\"long stone\"), as does Tremenheere \"settlement by the long stone\".\n\nThe French word (\"to jabber in a foreign language\") is derived from Breton ' (\"bread\") and ' (\"wine\"). The French word (\"large seagull\") is derived from Breton ', which shares the same root as English \"gull\" (Welsh ', Cornish \"\").\n\nThe first extant Breton texts, contained in the Leyde manuscript, were written at the end of the 8th century: 50 years prior to the Strasbourg Oaths, considered to be the earliest example of French. Like many medieval orthographies, Old- and Middle Breton orthography was at first not standardised, and the spelling of a particular word varied at authors' discretion. In 1499, however, the \"Catholicon\", was published; as the first dictionary written for both French and Breton, it became a point of reference on how to transcribe the language. The orthography presented in the \"Catholicon\" was largely similar to that of French, in particular with respect to the representation of vowels, as well as the use of both the Latinate digraph —a remnant of the sound change /kʷ/ > /k/ in Latin—and Brittonic or to represent /k/ before front vowels.\n\nAs phonetic and phonological differences between the dialects began to magnify, many regions, particularly the Vannes country, began to devise their own orthographies. Many of these orthographies were more closely related to the French model, albeit with some modifications. Examples of these modifications include the replacement of Old Breton with to denote word-final /x~h/ (an evolution of Old Breton /θ/ in the Vannes dialect) and use of to denote the initial mutation of /k/ (today this mutation is written ). and thus needed another transcription.\n\nIn the 1830s Jean-François Le Gonidec created a modern phonetic system for the language.\n\nDuring the early years of the 20th century, a group of writers known as elaborated and reformed Le Gonidec's system. They made it more suitable as a super-dialectal representation of the dialects of Cornouaille, Leon and Trégor (known as from \"Kernev\", \"Leon\" and \"Treger\" in Breton). This KLT orthography was established in 1911. At the same time writers of the more divergent Vannetais dialect developed a phonetic system also based on that of Le Gonidec.\n\nFollowing proposals made during the 1920s, the KLT and Vannetais orthographies were merged in 1941 to create an orthographic system to represent all four dialects. This (\"wholly unified\") orthography was significant for the inclusion of the \"zh\" digraph, which represents a in Vannetais and corresponds to a in the KLT dialects.\n\nIn 1955 François Falc'hun and the group Emgleo Breiz proposed a new orthography. It was designed to use a set of graphemes closer to the conventions of French. This (\"University Orthography\", known in Breton as ) was given official recognition by the French authorities as the \"official orthography of Breton in French education.\" It was opposed in the region and today is used only by the magazine \"Brud Nevez\" and the publishing house Emgléo Breiz.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974, a new standard orthography was devised — the or . This system is based on the derivation of the words.\n\nToday the majority of writers continue to use the \"Peurunvan orthography\", and it is the version taught in most Breton-language schools.\n\nDue to the deficient suitableness of those standardised, interdialectal orthography for many dialects (especially the Vannes dialect) they are seen as a threat by some activists, rather than as a helping tool for promoting and spreading the language because it endangers the rich variety of the still living dialects and encourages the usage of a de facto non-existent artificial language.\n\nBreton is written in the Latin script. \"Peurunvan\", the most commonly used orthography, consists of the following letters:\n\nThe circumflex, grave accent, trema and tilde appear on some letters. These diacritics are used in the following way:\n\nSee for an introduction to the Breton alphabet and pronunciation.\n\nBoth orthographies use the above alphabet, although \"é\" is used only in .\n\nDifferences between the two systems are particularly noticeable in word endings. In Peurunvan, final obstruents, which are devoiced in absolute final position and voiced in sandhi before voiced sounds, are represented by a grapheme that indicates a voiceless sound. In OU they are written as voiced but represented as voiceless before suffixes: (big), (bigger).\n\nIn addition, Peurunvan maintains the KLT convention, which distinguishes noun/adjective pairs by nouns written with a final voiced consonant and adjectives with a voiceless one. No distinction is made in pronunciation, e.g. ' \"Breton language\" vs. ' \"Breton (adj)\".\n\nSome examples of words in the different orthographies:\n\nNotes:\n\nVisitors to Brittany may encounter words and phrases (especially on signs and posters) such as the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54585022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54585022", "title": "Congress Spelling System", "text": "Congress Spelling System\n\nThe Congress Spelling System (Malay: \"Ejaan Kongres\") is a spelling reform of Malay Rumi Script introduced during the third Malay Congress held in Johor Bahru and Singapore in 1956. The main characteristics of the system are the use of symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet, going by the dictum of one symbol for one phoneme, and the new proposition in the writing of diphthongs.\n\nThe innovation was originally intended to replace the Za'aba Spelling System and ultimately to become a standard orthography in the Malay speaking world, but did not seem to gain acceptance in general. It was deemed impractical for use by the masses, and certain graphemes proposed by the system were not represented in the common typewriters at that time. Even then, certain groups, particularly those affiliated to the Literary Movement 1950 used the Congress graphemes for diphthongs in their own publications.\n\nIn the 1950s, two different orthographies were used in the Malay-speaking world, namely the Republican Spelling System in Indonesia and Za'ba Spelling System in British Malaya and Borneo. The Za'ba Spelling System, introduced in 1933, was the improvised version of the earlier orthography introduced by the British scholar, R J Wilkinson. Similarly in Indonesia, the Republican Spelling System was introduced in 1947 to replace the older Dutch Van Ophuijsen Spelling System.\n\nThe third Malay congress held in Johor Bahru and Singapore from 16th to 21st September 1956, seek to unite these two different orthographies into a single system. The new orthography, was envisioned to be a better and practical system, which is simplified and using standardized methods of spelling, and emphasized more on the use of Malay phonology system. During the congress, two proposal papers concerning the new orthography was presented by Literary Movement 1950 and Malay Language Association of University of Malaya. Literary Movement 1950, proposed a system already in use by their writers, largely based on Fajar Asia orthography introduced during Japanese occupation in 1943. Malay Language Association of University of Malaya generally rejects the use of digraphs and vehemently promotes the Indonesian spelling elements. A consensus was reached during the congress, and the new orthography was later named \"Ejaan Kongres\" (the congress spelling'). \n\nIn 1957, the Congress Spelling System was published for the first time by Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka in its language leaflet, DBP bilangan (1), with the title \"Kaedah Baharu Ejaan Rumi Bahasa Melayu (menurut keputusan Kongres Bahasa dan Persuratan Melayu III)\" (Malay for 'New Methods of Rumi Spelling of Malay Language (based on the decision of Congress of Malay language and letters III)').\n\nThe Congress Spelling System did not seem to gain acceptance of people in general. The reason was that it was not practical for use by the ordinary people and certain graphemes proposed by the system were not represented in the typewriters. Even then, certain groups, particularly those affiliated to the Literary Movement 1950 used the Congress graphemes for diphthongs in their own publications. This group even reverted to the Wilkinson style of writing the vowels in closed final syllables which was, similar to the Republican style in Indonesia. \n\nSince the Malay sections of publishing houses were mainly manned by members of the Literary Movement 1950 or their sympathisers, the Movement's style of spelling seemed to gain a widespread currency through published works. In the meantime, the schools and the government publications were still using the Za'aba or the school system of spelling. Hence, the public became confused as to which system to follow. Language usage outside the precincts of the school reflected a state of confusion in the minds of the people in the spelling of their language using the Rumi script. It was not unusual to find several systems used in a short passage in the print media not to mention in individual writings.\n\nThe state of confusion was ended with the introduction of New Rumi Spelling in 1972, that finally united the different orthographies of the Malay-speaking world into a single system.\n\nIn the third Malay Congress of 1956, a total of 16 resolutions were made for orthography, 2 resolutions for phonetics, and a resolution for Jawi alphabet. The list of letters agreed upon for the new orthography are as below. It consists of 20 traditional Malay consonants [b], [c], [d], [g], [h], [j], [k], [l], [m], [n], [ŋ], [ñ], [p], [q], [r], [s], [ŝ], [t], [w], [y] and consonants [f], [q], [v], [x] for adopted sounds from foreign languages.\n\nThe Congress Spelling also consists of 6 vowel sounds represented by 5 letters; [a],[e],[i],[o],[u], with [e] represents both /e/ and /ə/ sounds. It differed markedly with Za'aba Spelling that differentiates /e/ and /ə/ sounds with letters [e] and [ĕ] respectively. \n\nThe principle feature of the Congress Spelling is the representation of a phoneme with a grapheme or a single letter only. Thus, it rejects the use of digraphs commonly found in the earlier orthographies.\n\nThe Congress also made a new proposition in the writing of diphthongs. Whereas the Wilkinson and the Za'aba systems had [au], [ai] and [oi], the Congress system suggested [aw], [ay] and [oy].\n\nA fixed rule for the choice of vowels for morphemes in disyllabic words were established in the Congress Spelling. In the event that the morpheme of the first syllable is using vowels [e] and [o], morpheme bound to the final syllable must use vowels [e] and [o]. On the other hand, if morpheme of the first syllable is using vowels other than [e] and [o], the morpheme bound to the final syllable must use vowel [i] and [u].\n\nThis Congress rule contradicts with the old Za'ba Spelling that concentrate more on the native Malay phonology rather than using the existing theories and linguistic techniques. In Za'aba Spelling, for any final syllable that ends with letters [k] or [h], the morpheme bound to it must use vowel [e] instead of [i], with the exceptions given to diphthong [ai]. Conversely, for any final syllable that ends with letters other than [k] or [h],the morpheme bound to it must use vowel [i] instead of [e], with exceptions given to first syllable using vowels [o] or [e], thus vowel [e] must be used instead.\n\nMalay written in Jawi script generally utilizes both Arabic letters (ء) and (ع)، in addition to letter (ق), as glottal stops which transliterated in the old Rumi orthographies with apostrophes ('). The Congress Spelling are in agreement that Rumi phonemes for both letters are similar. However, due to differing opinions among the participants, the Congress Spelling did not produce any resolution on the use of both phonemes, and opened the issue for public interpretations. The congress nevertheless, proposed four resolutions concerning hamza and ayin.\n\n1. The phonemes shall not be represented by any grapheme when it become onset of first morpheme. For example, \n2. The phonemes shall be represented by letter [k] only if it become coda of the last morpheme. Example as follows\n3. he phonemes shall be represented by either letter [k] or ['], if it become coda of the first morpheme. Example as follows\n\n4. To avoid confusion, the apostrophe (') can be used to represent phoneme of glottal stops only if it become onset for non-first morpheme. Therefore, (مسئله) (Malay Jawi for 'problem') should be spelled as \"mas'alah\" in Rumi, not \"mas-alah\", \"masaalah\" or \"maskalah\".\n\nThere are a total of four resolutions concerning letter [h] in the Congress Spelling System.\n\n1. If the /h/ sound become onset of the first syllable. It can be either maintained or removed.\n2. If the /h/ is in between two similar vowels, the letter [h] must be maintained\nHowever, if the /h/ is in between two different vowels, the letter [h] can be either removed or maintained\n3. For similar sounding words that carry different meaning, both rules of maintaining and removing [h] are applied to differentiate their meaning.\n4.

Not only are these contexts too numerous to list in their entirety for any agroecosystem, but their interactions are so complex it is impossible to perfectly characterize a system, let alone predict the effect a given perturbation will have on the whole. At the same time, all of these contexts are dynamic, albeit at wildly diverging time scales, so the ecology of contexts for an agroecosystem is fundamentally mutable. An awareness of the ecology of contexts is helpful for agroecologists, as the nearly axiomatic acceptance dynamic, and thereby unperfectable, nature of agroecosystems precludes the often damaging notion of a best or ideal approach to agroecosystem management as well as an awareness of the complexity of the response that can result from any perturbation of the system.\n\nThis concept of the ecology of contexts provides a useful epistemological device for understanding agroecosystems.\n\nIn child development, for instance, it can refer to the nested scales at which influences on children reside, from the individual (e.g. age) to the broadest elements, like government policies or cultural attitudes.\n\nFrom computer science is the concept of ecology of context-aware computing, where a device's operation is tempered by information the device itself has about how the environment will affect its functioning and vice versa.\n\nIn the field of music therapy, Trygve Aasgaard dealt with the reciprocity of an ecology of contexts, seeing the role of music in therapy as responsive to cultural and other contexts, while at the same time forming part of the environmental context.\nThis dual relationship of an entity in an ecology of contexts underscores the ecological analogy, with its emphasis on holonic interactions.\n"}

Related to the latter meaning is the phrase \"\" which denotes anything related to ordinary sailors, as opposed to a ship's officers.\n\nIn medieval shipbuilding, a ship of war was usually equipped with a tall, multi-deck castle-like structure in the bow of the ship. It served as a platform for archers to shoot down on enemy ships, or as a defensive stronghold if the ship were boarded. A similar but usually much larger structure, called the aftcastle, was at the aft end of the ship, often stretching all the way from the main mast to the stern. \n\nHaving such tall upper works on the ship was detrimental to sailing performance. As cannons were introduced and gunfire replaced boarding as the primary means of naval combat during the 16th century, the medieval forecastle was no longer needed, and later ships such as the galleon had only a low, one-deck high forecastle. Sailors stationed on the forecastle, or \"forecastle men,\" were responsible for handling the headsails and the anchors. In the Royal Navy of the 17th and 18th centuries, these roles were reserved for older seamen who lacked the agility to go aloft or take other more strenuous duties aboard.\nBy the end of the 19th century, raised forecastle had become a typical feature on warships again, in an attempt to keep forward gun positions from getting unacceptably wet on heavy seas. In addition the forecastle may provide additional crew's quarters as in the past, and may contain essential machinery such as the anchor windlass. A disadvantage of such a design is the structural weakness at the forecastle 'break' (the rear end of the forecastle with the main deck behind and below) relative to a flush deck structure.\n\nSome sailing ships and many modern non-sail ships have no forecastle as such at all but the name is still used to indicate the foremost part of the upper deck – although often called the \"foredeck\" – and for any crews quarters in the bow of the ship, even if below the main deck.\n"}

{"id": "11887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11887", "title": "Greek language", "text": "Greek language\n\nGreek (Modern Greek: , \"elliniká\", \"Greek\", , \"ellinikí glóssa\", \"Greek language\") is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages, native to Greece and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language, spanning 34 centuries (3,400 years) of written records. Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history; other systems, such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary, were used previously. The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, Gothic and many other writing systems.\n\nThe Greek language holds an important place in the history of the Western world and Christianity; the canon of ancient Greek literature includes works in the Western canon such as the epic poems \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\". Greek is also the language in which many of the foundational texts in science, especially astronomy, mathematics and logic, and Western philosophy, such as the Platonic dialogues and the works of Aristotle, are composed; the New Testament of the Christian Bible was written in Koiné Greek. Together with the Latin texts and traditions of the Roman world, the study of the Greek texts and society of antiquity constitutes the discipline of Classics.\n\nDuring antiquity, Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world, West Asia and many places beyond. It would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire and develop into Medieval Greek. In its modern form, Greek is the official language in two countries, Greece and Cyprus, a recognised minority language in seven other countries, and is one of the 24 official languages of the European Union. The language is spoken by at least 13.2 million people today in Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Albania, Turkey, and the Greek diaspora.\n\nGreek roots are often used to coin new words for other languages; Greek and Latin are the predominant sources of international scientific vocabulary.\n\nGreek has been spoken in the Balkan peninsula since around the 3rd millennium BC, or possibly earlier. The earliest written evidence is a Linear B clay tablet found in Messenia that dates to between 1450 and 1350 BC, making Greek the world's oldest recorded living language. Among the Indo-European languages, its date of earliest written attestation is matched only by the now-extinct Anatolian languages.\n\nThe Greek language is conventionally divided into the following periods:\n\n\nIn the modern era, the Greek language entered a state of diglossia: the coexistence of vernacular and archaizing written forms of the language. What came to be known as the Greek language question was a polarization between two competing varieties of Modern Greek: Dimotiki, the vernacular form of Modern Greek proper, and Katharevousa, meaning 'purified', a compromise between Dimotiki and Ancient Greek, which was developed in the early 19th century and was used for literary and official purposes in the newly formed Greek state. In 1976, Dimotiki was declared the official language of Greece, having incorporated features of Katharevousa and giving birth to Standard Modern Greek, which is used today for all official purposes and in education.\n\nThe historical unity and continuing identity between the various stages of the Greek language is often emphasised. Although Greek has undergone morphological and phonological changes comparable to those seen in other languages, never since classical antiquity has its cultural, literary, and orthographic tradition been interrupted to the extent that one can speak of a new language emerging. Greek speakers today still tend to regard literary works of ancient Greek as part of their own rather than a foreign language. It is also often stated that the historical changes have been relatively slight compared with some other languages. According to one estimation, \"Homeric Greek is probably closer to demotic than 12-century Middle English is to modern spoken English,\" (Greek has seen fewer changes in 2700 years, than English has in 900 years).\n\nGreek is spoken by at least 13 million people, mainly in Greece, Albania and Cyprus, but also worldwide by the large Greek diaspora. There are traditional Greek-speaking settlements and regions in the neighbouring countries of Albania, Bulgaria, and Turkey, as well as in several countries in the Black Sea area, such as Ukraine, Russia, Romania, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, and around the Mediterranean Sea, Southern Italy, Syria, Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya and ancient coastal towns along the Levant. Particularly in Albania due to the immigration wave towards Greece today a significant percentage of the population can speak the Greek language, or at least has some basic knowledge of it. The language is also spoken by Greek emigrant communities in many countries in Western Europe, especially the United Kingdom and Germany, Canada, the United States, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, South Africa and others.\n\nGreek is the official language of Greece, where it is spoken by almost the entire population. It is also the official language of Cyprus (nominally alongside Turkish). Because of the membership of Greece and Cyprus in the European Union, Greek is one of the organization's 24 official languages. Furthermore, Greek is officially recognised as a minority language in parts of Italy and official in Dropull and Himara (Albania) and as a minority language all over Albania, as well as in Armenia, Romania, and Ukraine as a regional or minority language in the framework of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Greeks are also a recognised ethnic minority in Hungary.\n\nThe phonology, morphology, syntax and vocabulary of the language show both conservative and innovative tendencies across the entire attestation of the language from the ancient to the modern period. The division into conventional periods is, as with all such periodisations, relatively arbitrary, especially because at all periods, Ancient Greek has enjoyed high prestige, and the literate borrowed heavily from it.\n\nAcross its history, the syllabic structure of Greek has varied little: Greek shows a mixed syllable structure, permitting complex syllabic onsets but very restricted codas. It has only oral vowels and a fairly stable set of consonantal contrasts. The main phonological changes occurred during the Hellenistic and Roman period (see Koine Greek phonology for details):\n\nIn all its stages, the morphology of Greek shows an extensive set of productive derivational affixes, a limited but productive system of compounding and a rich inflectional system. Although its morphological categories have been fairly stable over time, morphological changes are present throughout, particularly in the nominal and verbal systems. The major change in the nominal morphology since the classical stage was the disuse of the dative case (its functions being largely taken over by the genitive). The verbal system has lost the infinitive, the synthetically-formed future and perfect tenses and the optative mood. Many have been replaced by periphrastic (analytical) forms.\n\nPronouns show distinctions in person (1st, 2nd, and 3rd), number (singular, dual, and plural in the ancient language; singular and plural alone in later stages), and gender (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and decline for case (from six cases in the earliest forms attested to four in the modern language). Nouns, articles and adjectives show all the distinctions except for person. Both attributive and predicative adjectives agree with the noun.\n\nThe inflectional categories of the Greek verb have likewise remained largely the same over the course of the language's history but with significant changes in the number of distinctions within each category and their morphological expression. Greek verbs have synthetic inflectional forms for:\n\nMany aspects of the syntax of Greek have remained constant: verbs agree with their subject only, the use of the surviving cases is largely intact (nominative for subjects and predicates, accusative for objects of most verbs and many prepositions, genitive for possessors), articles precede nouns, adpositions are largely prepositional, relative clauses follow the noun they modify and relative pronouns are clause-initial. However, the morphological changes also have their counterparts in the syntax, and there are also significant differences between the syntax of the ancient and that of the modern form of the language. Ancient Greek made great use of participial constructions and of constructions involving the infinitive, and the modern variety lacks the infinitive entirely (instead having a raft of new periphrastic constructions) and uses participles more restrictively. The loss of the dative led to a rise of prepositional indirect objects (and the use of the genitive to directly mark these as well). Ancient Greek tended to be verb-final, but neutral word order in the modern language is VSO or SVO.\n\nModern Greek inherits most of its vocabulary from Ancient Greek, which in turn is an Indo-European language, but also includes a number of borrowings from the languages of the populations that inhabited Greece before the arrival of Proto-Greeks, some documented in Mycenaean texts; they include a large number of Greek toponyms. The form and meaning of many words has evolved. Loanwords (words of foreign origin) have entered the language, mainly from Latin, Venetian, and Turkish. During the older periods of Greek, loanwords into Greek acquired Greek inflections, thus leaving only a foreign root word. Modern borrowings (from the 20th century on), especially from French and English, are typically not inflected; other modern borrowings are derived from South Slavic (Macedonian/Bulgarian) and Eastern Romance languages (Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian).\n\nGreek words have been widely borrowed into other languages, including English: \"mathematics\", \"physics\", \"astronomy\", \"democracy\", \"philosophy\", \"athletics, theatre, rhetoric\", \"baptism\", \"evangelist\", etc. Moreover, Greek words and word elements continue to be productive as a basis for coinages: \"anthropology\", \"photography\", \"telephony\", \"isomer\", \"biomechanics\", \"cinematography\", etc. and form, with Latin words, the foundation of international scientific and technical vocabulary like all words ending with \"–logy\" (\"discourse\"). There are many English words of Greek origin.\n\nGreek is an independent branch of the Indo-European language family. The ancient language most closely related to it may be ancient Macedonian, which many scholars suggest may have been a dialect of Greek itself, but it is so poorly attested that it is difficult to conclude anything about it. Independently of the Macedonian question, some scholars have grouped Greek into Graeco-Phrygian, as Greek and the extinct Phrygian share features that are not found in other Indo-European languages. Among living languages, some Indo-Europeanists suggest that Greek may be most closely related to Armenian (see Graeco-Armenian) or the Indo-Iranian languages (see Graeco-Aryan), but little definitive evidence has been found for grouping the living branches of the family. In addition, Albanian has also been considered somewhat related to Greek and Armenian by some linguists. If proven and recognised, the three languages would form a new Balkan sub-branch with other dead European languages.\n\nLinear B, attested as early as the late 15th century BC, was the first script used to write Greek. It is basically a syllabary, which was finally deciphered by Michael Ventris and John Chadwick in the 1950s (its precursor, Linear A, has not been deciphered to this day and most likely encodes a non-Greek language). The language of the Linear B texts, Mycenaean Greek, is the earliest known form of Greek.\n\nAnother similar system used to write the Greek language was the Cypriot syllabary (also a descendant of Linear A via the intermediate Cypro-Minoan syllabary), which is closely related to Linear B but uses somewhat different syllabic conventions to represent phoneme sequences. The Cypriot syllabary is attested in Cyprus from the 11th century BC until its gradual abandonment in the late Classical period, in favor of the standard Greek alphabet.\n\nGreek has been written in the Greek alphabet since approximately the 9th century BC. It was created by modifying the Phoenician alphabet, with the innovation of adopting certain letters to represent the vowels. The variant of the alphabet in use today is essentially the late Ionic variant, introduced for writing classical Attic in 403 BC. In classical Greek, as in classical Latin, only upper-case letters existed. The lower-case Greek letters were developed much later by medieval scribes to permit a faster, more convenient cursive writing style with the use of ink and quill.\n\nThe Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, each with an uppercase (majuscule) and lowercase (minuscule) form. The letter sigma has an additional lowercase form (ς) used in the final position:\nIn addition to the letters, the Greek alphabet features a number of diacritical signs: three different accent marks (acute, grave, and circumflex), originally denoting different shapes of pitch accent on the stressed vowel; the so-called breathing marks (rough and smooth breathing), originally used to signal presence or absence of word-initial /h/; and the diaeresis, used to mark full syllabic value of a vowel that would otherwise be read as part of a diphthong. These marks were introduced during the course of the Hellenistic period. Actual usage of the grave in handwriting saw a rapid decline in favor of uniform usage of the acute during the late 20th century, and it has only been retained in typography.\n\nAfter the writing reform of 1982, most diacritics are no longer used. Since then, Greek has been written mostly in the simplified monotonic orthography (or monotonic system), which employs only the acute accent and the diaeresis. The traditional system, now called the polytonic orthography (or polytonic system), is still used internationally for the writing of Ancient Greek.\n\nIn Greek, the question mark is written as the English semicolon, while the functions of the colon and semicolon are performed by a raised point (•), known as the \"ano teleia\" (). In Greek the comma also functions as a silent letter in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing (\"ó,ti\", \"whatever\") from (\"óti\", \"that\").\n\nAncient Greek texts often used \"scriptio continua\" ('continuous writing'), which means that ancient authors and scribes would write word after word with no spaces or punctuation between words to differentiate or mark boundaries. Boustrophedon, or bi-directional text, was also used in Ancient Greek.\n\nGreek has occasionally been written in the Latin script, especially in areas under Venetian rule or by Greek Catholics. The term / applies when the Latin script is used to write Greek in the cultural ambit of Catholicism (because / is an older Greek term for West-European dating to when most of (Roman Catholic Christian) West Europe was under the control of the Frankish Empire). / (meaning \"Catholic Chiot\") alludes to the significant presence of Catholic missionaries based on the island of Chios. Additionally the term Greeklish is often used when the Greek language is written in a Latin script in online communications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He left Germany after the Nazis came to power, living in several different European countries and eventually emigrating penniless to the United States in 1939. He became the editor of \"Aufbau\", a periodical published in German, and transformed it from a small monthly newsletter into an important weekly newspaper, especially during World War II and the postwar era, when it became an important source of information for Jews trying to establish new lives and for Nazi concentration camp survivors to find each other. George remained Editor in Chief of \"Aufbau\" until his death.\n\nManfred George was born on October 22, 1893 in Berlin, the son of a businessman. He studied law at universities in Berlin, Greifswald and Geneva. After a serious injury during World War I, he was discharged from military service and continued his studies, graduating in 1917 with a doctorate in law. He began his journalism career before graduation, writing for the newspaper, \"Deutsche Montagszeitung\" and he began contributing to \"Die Weltbühne\" in 1915. He then went to work at the publisher, Ullstein-Verlag. He quickly advanced from city editor of the \"Berliner Morgenpost\" to editor in chief of the \"Berliner Abendpost\". Later, he was a correspondent for the \"Vossiche Zeitung\" and worked as a managing editor in Breslau.\n\nAt one point during the conflicts over the Upper Silesia plebiscite, George was put before a firing squad by a Freikorps soldier, but was able to provide a certificate of military service and was released.\n\nAfter that, George was sent to Dresden and Leipzig as an Ullstein correspondent. In 1923, he began to make a name for himself as a theater critic, writing in the \"Berliner Volks-Zeitung\" and \"Acht-Uhr-Abendblatt\". He worked as Arts Editor of the newspaper, \"Tempo,\" as well as Associate Editor of the cultural magazine, \"Marsyas.\"\n\nIn 1924, along with Carl von Ossietzky, George was one of the founders of the leftist \"Republikanische Partei Deutschlands\" (\"Republican Party of Germany\"). George was the chairman of the party until it was dissolved later that year. A pacifist, George was also associated with the \"Deutsche Liga für Menschenrechte\" (\"German League for Human Rights\") and the \"Friedensbund der Kriegsteilnehmer\" (\"Association of War Veterans for Peace\"), which started an initiative that became known as the \"Nie-wieder-Krieg-Bewegung\" (\"No More War Movement\"). Both the Republikanische Partei and the Friedensbund were formed by a community of journalists and editors connected with the \"Berliner Volks-Zeitung\". George also joined the Zionist movement.\n\nAfter leaving Ullstein, he worked at Mosse-Verlag from 1923–1928, then returned to Ullstein. Around the end of the 1920s, he began to write radio plays. His musical revue, \"Oh, USA\" was broadcast in Berlin 50 times. He contributed to \"Die Weltbühne\" until 1932. the year he published a biography of Theodor Herzl, with introductions by Thomas Mann and Albert Einstein.\n\nWhen the Nazis gained control of the government in 1933, George emigrated to Czechoslovakia. In Prague, he was the publisher of an emigrant newspaper called the \"Prager Montagsblatt\" and was one of the founding members of the \"Jewish Revue\". After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he became a war correspondent for six months, writing for newspapers in Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Romania. After the Munich Agreement, George continued to live in exile first in Hungary, then Yugoslavia, Italy, Switzerland and France, finally settling in the United States. The Nazi regime expatriated him on August 5, 1938.\n\nWith an income of less than $4.00 a week, George started work in New York as editor of \"Aufbau\" and turned it into and important journalistic voice for the Jewish exile community in the post-World War II era, leading him to be called \"a central figure in Jewish journalism of the Hitler and post-Hitler period\".\n\nGeorge became a nationalized American in 1945. \"The New York Times\" wrote after his death on December 30, 1965 in New York City:\n\nGeorge was married to Jeanette (née Simon), a social worker, in 1920. They had two children, a son, Frank, who became an architect and a daughter, Renée, who became a book designer.\n\nLeni Riefenstahl, despite her association with Adolf Hitler, had a close friendship with George. In her memoirs, published in 1987, she credits their friendship with keeping her from falling deeper into Nazism. However, she was accused of using her friendship with George and other Jews as \"alibi-Juden\" (Jewish alibis), in an attempt to whitewash her past.\n\nIn 1963, Willy Brandt, then mayor of West Berlin, recognized George with the \"Berliner Bär\" award.\n\nGeorge was the cousin of German poet Nelly Sachs, who won the 1966 Nobel Prize in Literature. His sister was married to Oskar Maria Graf, who wrote regularly for \"Aufbau\". George's children attended Anna Essinger's boarding school, \"Landschulheim Herrlingen\" and were of the 66 children moved to safety in England in 1933.\n\nOn the 40th anniversary of George's death, his son, Frank George (b. 1921), was interviewed about his father in an article on the lives of exiled intellectuals in the Jewish diaspora. Photos of artwork of George's son and grandchildren, made by his daughter-in-law, sculptor Roseanne George (1921-2011), are in the Nelly Sachs Collection, archived in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n\n\n"}

The term is a dysphemism, originating in the common usage of \"Mickey Mouse\" as a pejorative. It came to prominence in the UK after use by the country's national tabloids.\n\nThe term was used by education minister Margaret Hodge, during a discussion on higher education expansion. Hodge defined a Mickey Mouse course as \"one where the content is perhaps not as rigorous as one would expect and where the degree itself may not have huge relevance in the labour market\"; and that, furthermore, \"simply stacking up numbers on Mickey Mouse courses is not acceptable\". This opinion is often raised in the summer when exam results are released and new university courses revealed. The phrase took off in the late 1990s, as the Labour government created the target of having 50% of students in higher education by 2010.\n\nIn 2000, Staffordshire University was mocked as providing \"David Beckham Studies\" because it provided a module on the sociological importance of football to students taking sociology, sports science, or media studies. A professor for the department stressed that the course would not focus on Beckham, and that the module examines \"the rise of football from its folk origins in the 17th century, to the power it's become and the central place it occupies in British culture, and indeed world culture, today.\" In July 2015, MEP Louise Bours referred to the module on \"Question Time\", but as though it was a full degree course. Other degrees deemed \"Mickey Mouse\" include \"golf management\" and \"surf science.\" Durham University designed a module centred around Harry Potter to examine \"prejudice, citizenship and bullying in modern society\" as a part of a B.A. degree in Education Studies.\n\nOne thing these courses share is that they are \"vocational\", which are perceived to be less intellectually rigorous than the traditional academic degrees. \n\nDefenders of these courses object that the derogatory comments made in the media rely on the low symbolic capital of new subjects and rarely discuss course contents beyond the titles. Another factor is the correct or incorrect perception that the take up of these subjects, and the decline of more traditional academic subjects like science, engineering, mathematics, is causing annual grade rise in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe A-level in General Studies is seen as a Mickey Mouse subject, as well as A-level Critical Thinking, with many universities not accepting it as part of the requirements for an offer.\n\nAdditionally, although not considered Mickey Mouse subjects as such, some qualifications are not preferred by top universities and are regarded as \"soft options\". A 2007 report stated that the sciences were more challenging than subjects such as Media Studies, which might be taken by students to get higher grades for university applications. An American example is a degree in physical education. These have been issued to members of the college's athletics teams, to make them eligible to play; otherwise they would fail to pass traditional subjects.\n\n"}

Two days of discussion from 8 through 10 December 1954, resulted in the signing of the agreement, which laid out ten conclusions regarding the language.\n\nThe agreement focused on the similarities between the two dialects, and was primarily concerned with reconciling the different dialects for the benefit of a federalized Yugoslavia. The agreement stated that groups of linguists and intellectuals from both the eastern Serbian variant and the western Croatian variant would work together towards establishing a single dictionary and terminology.\n\nThe agreement also stated that the future language should develop naturally, although it was being forged by political will and pressure from both dialects.\n\nThe new terminology and dictionary would have its roots in both varieties of the language, and the literary journal present at the agreement would have the same content published in both the Cyrillic and Latin script. However, many, such as Croatian intellectual Ljudevit Jonke, viewed the agreement as a veiled attempt to have Serbian become the official language of a federalized Yugoslavia, with only a passing nod given to Croatian.\n\nAs a direct result of the agreement, \"Matica srpska\" and its Croatian counterpart \"Matica hrvatska\" published an orthography manual in 1960. Although widely praised by all levels of Serbian and Yugoslav party officials and intellectuals, the orthography was roundly criticized by Croatian intellectuals, who saw the work as too Serb-centric. Their criticisms stemmed mainly from an analysis of the case of larger differences between the two dialects, claiming that the dictionary favored the eastern variant of the language over the western one.\n\nThe ten \"conclusions\", or \"zaključci:\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7237187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7237187", "title": "Pipil grammar", "text": "Pipil grammar\n\nThis article provides a grammar sketch of the Nawat or Pipil language, an endangered language spoken by the Pipils of western El Salvador, belonging to the Nahua group within the Uto-Aztecan language family. There also exists a brief typological overview of the language that summarizes the language's most salient features of general typological interest in more technical terms.\n\n\nThe voiced allophones of /k/, and , are common but their distribution is subject to both dialect variation and phonological rules (and their exceptions).\n\nThe /n/ phoneme has various allophones, as follows: \n\nMost words are stressed on the second to last syllable. Some are stressed on the last syllable: these include a few lexical compounds such as \"tenkal\" 'door, patio' (from \"ten\" 'mouth' and \"kal\" 'house'), certain prefixed or reduplicated monosyllables such as (optionally) \"kajkal\" 'houses', and many diminutives in \"-tzin\" or \"-chin\". There are also words in these categories with regular penultimate stress.\n\nReduplication is a morphological process employed in several parts of the grammatical system, which is characterized in phonological terms. Nawat reduplication takes the form of repetition of a word's first syllable (actually only the (C)V part thereof). So for example, a reduplication of \"kunet\" 'child' is \"ku-kunet\" 'children', and a derivative of the root \"petz-\" 'smooth' is \"pe-petz-ka\" 'a kind of small, silvery fish', local Spanish \"pepesca\".\n\nAnother more productive variety of reduplication involves adding a \"j\" after the reduplication, e.g., \"ku-j-kunet\" 'children', \"pe-j-petz-naj\" plural of \"petz-naj\" 'smooth, naked'. Generalizing, plain reduplication (without \"j\") is governed by lexical criteria. \"J\"-reduplication, on the contrary, is used by grammatical rules that: \n\nThe determiners (except for \"ne\") and quantifiers may be used pronominally, i.e., without a noun head, or preceding the noun they determine or quantify, e.g., \"ne takat\" 'the man', \"ini techan\" 'this village', \"miak kal\" 'many houses', \"ume siwat\" 'two women'.\n\nThe prefixes shown below are attached to nouns to express who they 'belong' to, e.g., \"nu-yak\" 'my nose', \"i-eltiw\" 'his/her sister', \"tu-mistun\" 'our cat', \"mu-techan\" 'your village'.\n\nSome nouns are always 'possessed', so that it is bad Nawat just to say *\"se yak\" 'a nose' or *\"ne eltiw\" 'the sister': instead one has to say \"se iyak\" 'one her-nose', \"ne nueltiw\" 'the my-sister', or whatever possessive form fits the context best. These include most nouns expressing either a part of the body or a member of one's family.\n\nOther nouns can occur either with or without a possessor. Some of these have two different forms, one (the absolute form) for use without a possessive prefix and the other (the possessed form) for use with a possessive prefix. These 'states' may be indicated by different suffixes, e.g., \"ne kune-t\" 'the child' → \"ne nu-kune-w\" 'my child; \"ne sin-ti\" 'the maize' → \"ne nu-sin\" 'my maize'; \"ne es-ti\" 'the blood' → \"ne nu-es-yu\" 'my blood'. When both states of the noun are zero-marked (like \"mistun\" and \"techan\"), the noun is 'invariable'.\n\nThe possessive indices tell us the person and number of the possessor, which may be specified by a noun phrase following the possessed noun. When that happens, the possessed normally has the third-person index, e.g., \"ne i-mistun ne piltzin\" 'the boy's cat' (literally: 'his-cat the boy'). \n\nThere is an alternative way to express this, if the noun is alienable, using the preposition \"pal\" or the relational \"ipal\": \"ne mistun pal ne piltzin\" ('the cat of the boy'). Even with an inalienable possession, it is possible to say \"ne inan pal ne piltzin\" ('the his-mother of the boy').\n\nNouns may be made plural by two different procedures: \n\nFor possessed forms:\n\nSome word that may accompany a noun in the noun phrase, such as the determiners \"ne\", \"ini\", \"uni\", are invariable for number, e.g., \"uni mistun\" 'that cat', \"uni mijmistun\" 'those cats'. On the other hand, nouns accompanied by a quantifier that is plural in meaning need not themselves be pluralized morphologically, e.g., \"ume mistun\" 'two cats'.\n\nAdjectives used attributively can precede or follow the noun, e.g., \"se selek iswat\" or \"se iswat selek\" 'a tender leaf' (\"selek\" 'tender, fresh, green', \"iswat\" 'leaf').\n\nThere is considerable variation regarding how to mark plural number in noun phrases containing an adjective. As long as some element or other in the noun phrase marks the phrase as plural, it seems not to matter which one, or even how many elements are (redundantly) pluralized, though there some speakers seem to indicate a preference for (1) marking plurality in the first possible component, and (2) avoiding redundancy, thus \"chijchiltik tzaput\" or \"tzajtzaput chiltik\", but \"ume chiltik tzaput\" or \"ume tzaput chiltik\".\n\nNo noun phrase is marked for case, and this is just as true of the pronouns, which have each a single form that can perform any function in the sentence.\n\nNoun phrases in core grammatical functions are not marked for case. To specify other roles, a preposition or a relational may precede a noun phrase. The main prepositions are:\n\nAll the above prepositions derive diachronically from relationals. In some cases the preposition merely represents an abbreviation of the relational by omitting the \"i-\" prefix.\n\nRelationals are quasi-nouns expressing some relationship (sometimes spatial, but not always) to their possessive complement. For example, \"nu-jpak\", meaning 'on or over me', consists of the relational \"(i)jpak\" conveying 'position above' with a first person singular possessor. Some relationals are shown in third-person-singular forms in the following table:\n\nThe following table shows the prefixes that serve to index the subject and object, respectively. (Note that in the subjunctive mood the second-person subject prefix takes the special form \"shi-\".)\n\nVerbs with a plural subject take a plural suffix: basically \"-t\" except in the subjunctive when \"-kan\" is used:\n\nTransitive verbs take, in addition, an object prefix after the subject prefix. The third-singular object prefix \"ki-\" is shortened to \"-k-\" when preceded by any of the subject prefixes \"ni-\", \"ti-\" or \"shi-\". This is illustrated here by the present (indicative) and subjunctive of an intransitive verb (\"panu\" 'pass') and a transitive verb with a third-person-singular object (\"-pia\" 'have'):\n\nA few examples follow:\n\nTenses (so called for convenience although they include aspect or mood categories) are characterized by distinct suffixes. The plural suffix \"-t\" combines with each tense suffix to give us plural tense endings, also shown here. \n\nThe verbs classified as Class I in this table end in \"a\" or \"i\" in the present and subjunctive, but that vowel is lost in the past (which ends in \"-ki\" in this class) and in the perfect (all perfects are in \"-tuk\"). Class II verbs, which end in \"a\", \"i\" or \"u\", retain this in all forms, and form their past in \"-k\". Class III differs from Class I only in that there is no past suffix at all, only the bare stem. Class IV verbs end in \"-ia\" or \"-ua\" in the present, but lose their final \"a\" in all the other tenses (including the subjunctive), and add a \"j\" in the past and perfect.\n\nClass I includes a sub-class of mutating stems that end in the present and subjunctive in \"-wa\", \"-ua\", \"-ya\" or \"-ia\". These change to \"-j-\", \"-uj-\", \"-sh-\" and \"-ish-\", respectively, in the past and perfect. \n\nThere are very few truly irregular verbs. The present and subjunctive of \"yawi\" 'go' and \"witz\" 'come' are given in full here:\n\nThe directional prefix \"wal-\" 'towards the speaker' follows subject indices but precedes object indices (in transitive verbs) except for \"ki-\". It has the morphological peculiarity that when preceded by \"ni-\", \"ti-\", \"shi-\" or \"ki-\" both \"i\" and \"w\" are omitted, leaving \"nal-\", \"tal-\", \"shal-\" and \"kal-\". When \"ni-/ti-/shi-\", \"ki-\" and \"wal-\" would all come together, the \"ki-\" component disappears altogether, so that \"nal-\", \"tal-\" and \"shal-\" do double duty as transitive (= \"ni- + ki- + wal-\", etc.) markers as well as intransitive (= \"ni- + wal-\", etc.) ones. The plural object marker \"kin-\" is split in two when combined with \"wal-\". The following examples illustrate.\n\nMost Nawat verbs belong clearly to one of two major formal types: intransitive or transitive. \n\nHere, intransitive verbs are those that cannot have an object and corresponding object prefixes—while transitive verbs are those that must have an object and object prefix. Neither subject nor object noun phrases need be present in the sentence, but whether explicit or implicit, the corresponding subject and object indices must. (This statement rests on the convention of considering the index for a third-person subject to take the form of 'zero'.)\n\nSome of the most common intransitive and transitive Nawat verbs are given below:\n\nThere are a number of means, grammatical or lexical, for changing a verb's valency (the number of arguments it takes) and thereby effectively 'converting' it to a different transitivity type. A considerable number of lexical pairs exist consisting of two related verbs, one intransitive and the other transitive:\n\nApart from such purely lexical alternations, there are two prefixes with specific grammatical functions which, attached to transitive verbs, reduce their surface valency (when they are used, there is no object prefix): \n\nSome Nawat verbs have a complement that does not correspond to any index in the verb. These include the following: \n\nThere are several ways for a verb to be subordinated to another (preceding) verb. \n\n\n\nThe serial construction also serves as the structure for a number of compound expressions of tense, aspect and modality, e.g.\n\nBut there are also constructions, or variant expressions, that depart from this pattern somewhat. \n\nThe invariable word \"katka\", which means 'was' or 'before, in the past', may occur following a verb form to establish past or habitual reference, e.g., \"inte kimati katka\" 'he didn't know'.\n\nNegative particles immediately precede either a verb or a non-verbal predicate. Basically there are three of them:\n\nThey also combine with pronouns and adverbs to yield other negative expressions, e.g., \"(in)te (t)atka\" 'nothing', \"(in)te aka\" 'no one', \"(in)te keman\" 'never', \"nian aka\" 'no one at all, and no one', \"maka keman\" 'never ever!', etc.: \"Inte nikmati tatka (datka)\" 'I know nothing', \"Maka shikilwi aka!\" 'Do not tell anyone!'\n\nTwo suffixes, \"-a\" and \"-uk\", lend different phasal nuances to a predicate, i.e., they add certain temporal (or related) notions, expressing that a situation has already been reached (with \"-a\") or that it still obtains (with \"-uk\"). The more common phasal suffix, \"-a\", is also used simply to place emphasis on the predicate so marked. Compare for example:\n\nIn negative sentences, the phasal suffixes are added to the negative particle, for example:\n\nYes-no questions are not differentiated grammatically from the corresponding statements. They may be affirmative, e.g., \"Taja tikmati?\" 'Do you know?', or negative, e.g., \"Inte tikitak kanka witz?\" 'Didn't you see where he was coming from?'\n\nFor replying affirmatively to yes-no questions, one may use \"E / Ej / Eje\" 'Yes', and sometimes \"Kia\" 'That's right' (literally 'So'). But it is equally common to respond using the appropriately inflected form of the main verb of the question, e.g.. (offering a cookie, for example) \"Tikneki se? - Nikneki\" 'Would you like one? - I would', \"Weli titaketza Nawat? - Weli\" 'Can you speak Nawat? - I can'. The standard negative answer is \"Inte / Te / Tesu\" 'No', or again, the verb of the question negated: \"Tikitak uni takat ka ne? - Te nikitak\" 'Did you see that man over there? - I did not'. Other idiomatic responses include \"Nusan\" 'Also', \"Teika inte!\" or \"Taika te!\" 'Why not!' and \"Inte / Te / Tesu nikmati\" 'I don't know'.\n\nWh-questions are formed with a wh-word, which usually immediately precedes the predicate (verbal or non-verbal.\n\nIndirect questions are introduced by either \"(a)su\" 'if, whether' or a wh-expression, depending on the kind of question.\n\n\"Wan\" or \"iwan\" (which is also the preposition and relational 'with') serves as an all-purpose coordinating conjunction. There seem not to be any specialised native words for 'but' and 'or' (unless \"ush\" 'or' is one), and the Spanish words \"pero\" and \"o\" are sometimes used. \"N(i)an\" 'nor' may be used to coordinate negative statements. \"Mal\" or \"melka\" 'although, even though' can form adversative clauses, e.g., \"Niyaw niyaw, mal-te/melka te nikneki\" 'I will go, although I don't want to'. \"Nusan\" 'also' is common, e.g., \"Yaja nusan walaj\" 'She also came'; its negative counterpart is simply \"nusan te...\" 'not...either', e.g., \"Naja nusan te nikneki nitakwa\" 'I don't want to eat either'.\n\nsubordinate clauses are introduced by subordinators; the following table illustrates some of the most common:\n\nRelative clauses, which always follow (rather than precede) their head, may be simply juxtaposed clauses, or introduced by the article \"ne\", the general complementizer \"ka\" or the interrogative pronoun \"ká\" (the last two being distinguished phonologically in various ways in the dialects). Headless relative clauses are introduced by interrogative pronouns.\n\nAs regards origin, the Pipil lexicon consists of the following components:\n\n\nThere exist mechanisms of native origin for the creation of derived and compound words. No doubt these were more actively used in the language's past, since some such mechanisms are only attested in fossilized form. In more recent periods of the language, use of such procedures appears to have decreased, and with them the productivity of the procedures themselves.\n\nA selection of well-attested derivational affixes follows:\n\nIdeophones are a distinct set of lexical items, often denoting some process that is directly perceived by the senses (such as a kind of sound or visual experience), which enter into a special range of language-specific grammatical patterns. Nawat is one of many languages possessing such items and the associated patterns, which in this case are 'expressive' verb formations. The root form of a typical Nawat ideophone is a CVCV sequence, e.g., \"-chala-, -china-, -kelu-, -kina-, -kumu-, -kwala-, -tapa-, -tikwi-, -tzaya-, -tzili-, -tzutzu-\". These roots are not words and only acquire full meaning when they enter into one or another of the derivational patterns for Nawat ideophones. Some at least are probably onomatopoeic in origin.\n\nThe four most common morphological patterns for such Nawat verb formations are the following (R represents the ideophone root, rR a reduplicated root without \"j\"):\n\nClassical Nahuatl is characterized by widespread use of the device of incorporation. This is a grammatical and lexical phenomenon found in different guises in many languages. The Nahuatl system is quite well known to linguists because it is often cited as an example in linguistic literature. \n\nBriefly, in incorporation a lexeme potentially representing one of a verb's semantic arguments or adjuncts, rather than forming a separate grammatical constituent is allowed to be attached directly to the verb itself thereby forming a compound verb. In Nahuatl this incorporated lexeme is prefixed to the verb.\n\nIn Pipil, examples of this kind of structure also occur. However, their use is far less widespread than in Classical Nahuatl, and the process is barely (if at all) productive. Therefore existing examples rather resemble ordinary lexicalized compounds. Furthermore, most of those used involve one of a specific, limited range of incorporating elements that show considerable grammaticalization, and are therefore perhaps best viewed, in the Pipil context at least, simply as derivational prefixes.\n\nThe grammaticalization of these elements manifests itself in form, meaning and function. The Pipil forms of some of these incorporating stems are somewhat specialized phonologically; moreover, some of the forms used for incorporation no longer have corresponding full-word counterparts. \n\nMost of the narrow set of widely used incorporating elements belong to a single semantic set, that of body parts. While in some compounds the literal meanings of such elements subsists, in many others they only retain a broadly metaphorical sense, while in some it is quite difficult to perceive any particular meaning at all.\n\nA selection of Pipil 'incorporation prefixes' with illustrations of some of their uses follows:\n\nExamples of sentences containing incorporation compounds:\n\nLexical stems may combine to form other kinds of lexical compounds. Compounding mechanisms may still exist in the spontaneous language use of some speakers (to the extent that they still have spontaneous language use) but there is limited evidence for their natural, productive application. \n\nWhere traditional compounds are concerned, much of what has beensaid about incorporation is equally applicable. In fact, the same lexical combining forms that predominate in incorporation verbs often reappear in other compounds. Since these tend to be monosyllables with a low level of semantic specificity, we may call them 'light elements' and the compounds they form 'light compounds'.\n\nCompounds containing more than one 'heavy' lexeme are rather rarer, and when new ones are proposed it is perhaps most often in response to the pressure of Spanish, i.e., in attempts to find a 'native' equivalent to a Spanish word in order to avoid a loanword. In the following table, '%' preceding a word indicates a neologism (proposed by at least one native speaker).\n\nWhen speakers fail to find an adequate word or expression in Nawat they may (1) employ a circumlocution (for example, they could call the kitchen \"kan titamanat\" '(the place) where we cook'), (2) borrow a Spanish word or expression (e.g., \"ne cosinaj\" 'the \"cocina' (kitchen)\"), or (3) simply code-switch. However, when we speak of loanwords we have in mind items of foreign origin that have become habitual elements of Nawat usage and may also have undergone adaptation as a result.\n\nWith one possible exception (\"pashalua\" 'go for a walk, take time off work' < *pasyarua < Spanish \"pasear\" + the non-productive verb suffix \"-ua\"), verbs can only be borrowed into Nawat from other languages in an invariable form based on the Spanish infinitive. Such forms cannot be conjugated directly. Instead, they must be preceded by the Nawat verb \"-chiwa\" 'make, do' to form compound expressions, e.g., from Spanish \"escribir\" 'write' we have Nawat \"nikchiwa escribir\" (contracted to \"nikcha escribir\") 'I write' (literally 'I do \"escribir' \"), \"tikchiwket\" or \"tikchijket escribir\" 'we wrote' (lit. 'we did \"escribir' \"), etc.\n\nPipil internal dialect variation is incompletely documented at present. While recognising the existence of important gaps in our knowledge (which may or may not ever be filled, as the last native speakers pass on), we do know of two well-defined dialect areas, at least as far as the department of Sonsonate is concerned, which may tentatively be called Upland and Lowland. The Upland dialect area includes the towns of Izalco and Nahuizalco, the Lowland area those of Santo Domingo de Guzmán and Cuisnahuat. Present knowledge also includes some points of differentiation between Santo Domingo and Cuisnahuat. Thus for practical purposes we are chiefly able to speak of three known varieties: Izalco, Cuisnahuat and Santo Domingo.\n\n\n\n\nA few examples of inter-dialectal lexical differences follow:\n\nAmong the works published since the early twentieth century until the present in which the Pipil language is described or transcribed at any length, rarely do two authors fully coincide in the spelling conventions they use. The spelling system used in this article is that employed in recently produced materials associated with the Nawat language recovery initiative IRIN. The following table allows this to be compared to with other spelling systems, ordered approximately in reverse chronological order.\n\n\n"}

It is a common destination for mail for people who are visiting a particular location and have no need, or no way, of having mail delivered directly to their place of residence at that time.\n\nPoste Restante is a long-established service within Australia run by the national postal service, Australia Post, which allows you to have your post sent to a city-centre holding place. There your post will be held for up to 1 month and you can go in and collect it by providing a proof of identity, such as a passport.\n\nFor example, for the Adelaide GPO (General Post Office, i.e. the main post office in the city of Adelaide) you would address the letter or parcel to your recipient thus:\n\nThe recipient would then need to go to the Adelaide GPO at 141 King William St., Adelaide, SA to collect it when it was due to arrive or shortly afterwards.\n\nbpost uses the term Poste Restante (French), Postliggend (Dutch) or Postlagernd (German) which needs to be indicated on the post together with the name, optionally the first name, full name of the post office, postal code and city. The recipient has one month the time to collect the post after which it will be sent back to the sender. A special tax applies valued at the price of one stamp of value 2. As of 1st of March 2018 this price is 1,74 €. This tax is usually paid by the recipient but can also be paid by the sender.\n\nIn the Bosnia and Herzegovina, mail is addressed to POSTE RESTANTE, which is written after the full name of the recipient (as appears on the identification to be presented ID document or a passport, if abroad).\n\nIn Cambodia, mail is addressed to POSTE RESTANTE, which is written after the full name of the recipient. Parcels and letters should contain a phone number, but recipients are more likely to get notified by phone for a parcel.\n\nCanada Post uses the term \"general delivery\" in English, and \"poste restante\" in French. Travellers may use the service for up to four months, and it is also used in circumstances where other methods of delivery (such as post office boxes) are not available.\n\nCanada Post guidelines for addressing of letter mail stipulate that general delivery mail should be addressed in the following fashion:\n\nwhere GD is the abbreviation for general delivery (alternatively \"PR\" for “\"poste restante\"” in French), and STN A is the station or post office (in this case, Station A). When the mail is to be delivered to a retail postal outlet, then the abbreviation RPO is used, and in French the station is indicated by SUCC for “\"succursale\",” or retail postal outlet by \"CSP\" for “\"comptoir postal\"”. In the above example, the French version of the address would use \"PR SUCC A\" for the second line.\n\nIn Croatia, mail is addressed to POSTE RESTANTE, which is written after the full name of the recipient (as appears on the identification to be presented ID document or a passport, if abroad).\n\nIn Croatia letters received to \"poste restante\" address are kept in post office for 30 calendar days.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, mail can be addressed to the post office if \"POSTE RESTANTE\" and the full name of the recipient is included. The recipient gets the letter (or package) if he or she has a valid ID (ID, passport, driving licence). The mail Will be retained for only 15 days.\n\n\"Poste restante\" is offered in all post offices in Finland.\n\nThe address is entered using the following format:\n\nPrior to April 1, 2013, it was also possible to use a nickname instead of real name and without providing an ID.\n\nHere 12340 represents the postal number of the post office. For example, Helsinki main post office is \"00100 Helsinki\".\n\nIn Finland letters received to \"poste restante\" address are kept in post office for 14 days and after arrival.\n\nIn France, La Poste offers the service for letters at an additional cost of €0.85, to be paid by the receiver. Packages are €4.00 each upon collection. Letters are kept for 15 days. The service is offered at any post office. The only requirement is to add 'Poste restante' after the recipient's name.\n\nDeutsche Post offer the service for all mail items under the \"Postlagernd\" (General Delivery) service. Domestic items may make use of a passphrase instead of the recipients name if preferred. As a general rule, the item should be addressed to the \"Hauptpost\" (main post office) of the location. Beware that some post employees may tell you that the service is no longer used and all Poste Restante mail is thrown out.\n\nAddress Format:\n\nThe phrase \"Kennwort:\" (Password) in front of the passphrase requires the consignee to specify the passphrase at time of collection.\nItems may be collected from the designated post office upon production of valid identification (e.g. Passport) and the passphrase.\n\nIt is important to use the term Postlagernd in preference to, or in conjunction with, Poste Restante to prevent returned mail.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Hongkong Post is responsible for handling the mail and mail can be sent to any post office. At the address side, mark the mail with \"Poste Restante\" or \"存局待領\" in bold.\n\nThe address format is like this:\n\nThe name of recipient must be real and in full. No initial or figure is allowed.\n\nHungarian post requires poste restante (\"postán maradó\") delivery to be addressed to specific post offices. Additionally, the postal service provides a \"pick-up\" service for web-based businesses where a business can ship to a pick-up point.\n\nIndia Post offers a Poste Restante service of up to two months at various post offices throughout the country. Mail is addressed thus:\n\nCarry a passport or some other form of national identification to pick it up.\n\nIn India, letters are said to be held for around a month, up to two in larger GPOs, before being returned; so ask the senders to add their return address, or to use your own home address for it. \n\nIn Italy, writing \"fermoposta\" together with the full name of the addressee and postal code will activate general delivery at the relevant post office. Letter post is retained for 30 days; parcel post is normally retained for 15 days, with an exceptional period of 1 month.\n\nIn Japan, the term indicates a Poste Restante mail.\n\nThe Japan Post Service guidelines for addressing stipulate that general delivery domestic mail should be addressed in the following fashion:\n\nFor international mail,\n\nwhere “163-8799” is the postcode of the post office, “Nishi-Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo-to” is the address of the post office, “Shinjuku-Yuubinkyoku” is the name of the post office, and “-dome” means “keep it there”.\n\nA poste restante mail will be kept in the post office for 10 days, identification is required for pickup.\n\nIn Lithuania, the words \"Poste restante\" or \"Iki pareikalavimo\" (used locally in Lithuania) should be made bold.\n\nFor local mail:\n\nMaltaPost offers Poste Resante service from a post office in the capital Valletta for up to three months, after which mail is returned to sender. Prior to using the service, the person must inform MaltaPost via email, and a means of identification needs to be provided when picking up the mail. Mail should be addressed as follows:\n\nPostNL offers Poste Restante service for up to one month, after which the mail will be returned to the original sender (if provided). This service is provided by all Dutch post offices. Mail should be addressed thus:\n\nNew Zealand Post offers a Poste Restante service of up to two months at various post offices throughout the country. Mail is addressed thus:\n\nIn Norway, Norway Post provides the Poste Restante service in all post offices. Ordinary mail is returned to sender 3 weeks after arrival. Parcels and registered letters are returned to sender after 2 weeks. Valid foreign identification for obtaining mail is limited to passports and European Identity cards. Mail is addressed according to the following format:\n\nMail should be addressed according to the following format:\nwhere 12-345 represents the zip code of the post office and 6 represents post office number within given city. (In Poland every post office is uniquely identified by city and number, e.g. \"Warszawa 1\" or \"Kraków 35\". These numbers are used only when the post office itself is the point of delivery, e.g. mailboxes or \"poste restante\".) There is no address of a recipient on the envelope, and if no sender address is provided, mail is considered undeliverable after 14 days. Every Poczta Polska office is valid target for \"poste restante\" delivery and the service is provided with no additional cost. All types of mail, e.g. letters, parcels and money orders, can be sent to \"poste restante\".\n\nIn Portugal, CTT provides the Poste Restante service (\"Posta Restante\") in all post offices. The mail will be kept in the post office until the last day of the following month after it was received. Mail is addressed according to the following format:\n\nThe recipient has to pay a 0,65€ tax in the act of receiving the mail.\n\nIn Slovenia mail is addressed to POŠTNO LEŽEČE, which is written after the full name of the recipient (as appears on the identification to be presented ID document or a passport, if abroad).\n\nIn Slovenia letters received for a \"poste restante\" address are kept in post office for 15 calendar days.\n\nMail can also be received at Spanish Post Offices. There is normally no charge for the service. Poste Restante letters should be addressed Lista de Correos, followed by the address of the post office (including the post code, town and province). Put your surname in capitals. An example Lista de Correos address is:\n\nTo find the address of the Correos nearest to you check at www.correos.es. Click on the Oficinas link for the Localizador de Oficinas.\n\nWhen collecting mail from the post office you will need to show some form of identification such as a passport or photo driving licence. Specify that you are collecting a Lista de Correos item as these are stored separately from the other stored mail. The Lista de Correos mail is filed alphabetically and it may be worth asking them to check if an expected package was filed under your first name if they cannot find it under your surname. Post offices vary in how long they will hold your mail. \n\nWhen addressing mail for Spain, always ensure there is a return address on the parcel or packet.\n\nNot all post offices offer \"poste restante\". The address is entered using the following format:\nHere, 123 45 represents the postal number of the post office. Post offices providing \"poste restante\" services can be located by searching for \"poste restante\" as \"street address\" in a given city (giving you a postal number) and then searching for post offices with that postal number.\n\nIn Switzerland, all post offices offer \"poste restante\" for free for up to one month. Addressing takes the following format:\n\nHere, 1234 represents the postal number of the post office. The correct street address can be found online.\n\nFor Istanbul, the main parcel and post restante office is in Sirkeci, a few minutes walk from the Sirkeci tram stop.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, mail is addressed to POSTE RESTANTE (or TO BE CALLED FOR), which is written after the full name of the recipient (as appears on the identification to be presented e.g. a passport, if abroad), then the name and full address of the destination post office, thus:\n\nIf only addressed to a town name, for example “POSTE RESTANTE, LONDON”, mail will go to the closest main post office branch (there being more than a hundred \"crown offices\" – directly-managed post office branches – in London. Some small branches do not offer the poste restante service.\n\nThe sender should also include their return address. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Mail will hold mail posted from within the UK for two weeks, whereas mail posted from abroad is normally held for one month. If the recipient is at sea however, it will be held for two months. Where mail is not collected within that time, it will be returned to the sender, or if there is no sender indicated, will be treated as undeliverable. If the sender would like uncollected mail returned sooner, they can indicate this on the envelope. Timescales vary from country to country according to local practice.\n\nIn the United States, the U.S. Postal Service uses the term General Delivery. Mail for general delivery to recipients in the United States is addressed in the following fashion:\n\n<poem>MRS. JANE Q. SMITH\nGENERAL DELIVERY\nWASHINGTON, DC  20090‑9999\n</poem>\n\nGeneral delivery is normally available at only one facility under the administration of a post office with multiple facilities. Post offices that hold mail for general delivery may hold such mail for up to 30 days. When sending to general delivery, the optional add-on code is \"-9999\".\n\n"}
{"id": "3739375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3739375", "title": "Q-systems", "text": "Q-systems\n\nQ-systems are a method of directed graph transformations according to given grammar rules, developed at the Université de Montréal by Alain Colmerauer in 1967--70 for use in natural language processing. The Université de Montréal's machine translation system, TAUM-73, used the Q-Systems as its language formalism.\n\nThe data structure manipulated by a Q-system is a Q-graph, which is a directed acyclic graph with one entry node and one exit node, where each arc bears a labelled ordered tree. An input sentence is usually represented by a linear Q-graph where each arc bears a word (tree reduced to one node labelled by this word). After analysis, the Q-graph is usually a bundle of 1-arc paths, each arc bearing a possible analysis tree. After generation, the goal is usually to produce as many paths as desired outputs, with again one word per arc. \n\nA Q-System consists of a sequence of Q-treatments, each being a set of Q-rules, of the form <matched_path> == <added_path> [<condition>]. The Q-treatments are applied in sequence, unless one of them produces the empty Q-graph, in which case the result is the last Q-graph obtained. The three parts of a rule can contain variables for labels, trees, and forests. All variables after \"==\" must appear in the <matched_path> part. Variables are local to rules.\n\nA Q-treatment works in two steps, addition and cleaning. It first applies all its rules exhaustively, using instantiation (one-way unification), thereby adding new paths to the current Q-graph (added arcs and their trees can be used to produce new paths). If and when this addition process halts, all arcs used in some successful rule application are erased, as well as all unused arcs that are no more on any path from the entry node to the exit node. Hence, the result, if any (if the addition step terminates), is again a Q-graph. That allows several Q-Systems to be chained, each of them performing a specialized task, together forming a complex system. For example, TAUM 73 consisted of fifteen chained Q-Systems.\n\nAn extension of the basic idea of the Q-Systems, namely to replace instantiation by unification (to put it simply, allow \"new\" variables in the right hand side part of a rule, and replace parametrized labelled trees by logical terms) led to Prolog, designed by Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel in 1972. Refinements in the other direction (reducing non-determinism and introducing typed labels) by John Chandioux led to GramR, used for programming METEO from 1985 onward.\n\nIn 2009, Hong Thai Nguyen of GETALP GETALP, LIG (Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble) reimplemented the Q-language in C, using ANTLR to compile the Q-systems and the Q-graphs, and an algorithm proposed by Christian Boitet (as none had been published and sources of the previous Fortran implementation had been lost). That implementation was corrected, completed and extended (to labels using Unicode characters and not only the printable characters of the CDC6600 of the historical version) by David Cattanéo in 2010-11.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27298240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27298240", "title": "Serbo-Croatian grammar", "text": "Serbo-Croatian grammar\n\nSerbo-Croatian is a South Slavic language that has, like most other Slavic languages, an extensive system of inflection. This article describes exclusively the grammar of the Shtokavian dialect, which is a part of the South Slavic dialect continuum and the basis for the Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian standard variants of Serbo-Croatian.\n\nPronouns, nouns, adjectives and some numerals decline (change the word ending to reflect case, the grammatical category and function) whereas verbs conjugate for person and tense. As in other Slavic languages, the basic word order is subject–verb–object (SVO), but the declensions show sentence structure and so word order is not as important as in more analytic languages, such as English or Chinese. Deviations from the standard SVO order are stylistically marked and may be employed to convey a particular emphasis, mood or overall tone, according to the intentions of the speaker or writer. Often, such deviations will sound literary, poetical or archaic.\n\nNouns have three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) that correspond, to a certain extent, with the word ending so most nouns with -a are feminine, -o and -e neuter, and the rest mostly masculine but with some feminine. The grammatical gender of a noun affects the morphology of other parts of speech (adjectives, pronouns, and verbs) attached to it. Nouns are declined into seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental.\n\nVerbs are divided into two broad classes according to their aspect, which can be either \"perfective\" (signifying a completed action) or \"imperfective\" (action is incomplete or repetitive). There are seven tenses, four of which (present, perfect, future I and II) are used in contemporary Serbo-Croatian, and the other three (aorist, imperfect and pluperfect) used much less frequently. The pluperfect is generally limited to written language and some more educated speakers, and the aorist and imperfect are considered stylistically marked and rather archaic. However, some nonstandard dialects make considerable (and thus unremarked) use of those tenses.\n\nAll Serbo-Croatian lexemes in this article are spelled in accented form in the Latin alphabet as well as in both accents (Ijekavian and Ekavian, with Ijekavian bracketed) when these differ (see Serbo-Croatian phonology.)\n\nSerbo-Croatian makes a distinction between three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, instrumental) and two numbers (singular and plural).\n\nSerbo-Croatian has three main declensional types, traditionally called a-type, e-type and i-type respectively, according to their genitive singular ending.\n\nThis type reflects Proto-Slavic o-stems, and is characterized by the endings (-o), (-e), or zero (-Ø) in the nominative singular, and (-a) in genitive singular. It includes most of the masculine and all of the neuter nouns. \n\nThe category of animacy is important for choosing of accusative singular of o-stems, and of personal pronouns. Animate nouns have the accusative case like the genitive, and inanimate nouns have the accusative case like the nominative. This is also important for adjectives and numerals that agree with masculine nouns in case.\n\nThis type has two sets of case endings: one for masculine, and the other for neuter gender:\n\nThe zero ending -Ø is for masculine nouns that end in consonant in nominative singular. Most masculine monosyllabic and some bisyllabic words receive an additional suffix -ov- or -ev- throughout the plural (\"bor – borovi\" 'pine', \"panj – panjevi\" 'stump').\n\nThe choice of -o- and -e- endings in the nominative, vocative and instrumental singular, as well as the plural suffix -ov-/-ev-, is governed by the stem-final consonant: if it is a \"soft\" (chiefly palatal consonant – \"c, č, ć, đ, j, lj, nj, š, ž, št\", and sometimes \"r\"), -e- endings are used, and -o endings otherwise; however, there are exceptions.\n\nSome loanwords, chiefly of French origin, preserve the ending vowel (-e, -i, -o, -u) as part of the stem; those ending in -i receive an additional epenthetic -j- suffix in oblique cases: \"kàfē – kafèi\" 'café', \"pànō – panòi\" 'billboard', \"kànū – kanùi\" 'canoe', \"tàksi – taksiji\" 'taxi'. They are always of masculine gender; loanwords ending in -a are typically of the e-declension class (feminine); neuter nouns are basically a closed class.\n\nMasculine nouns belonging to this declension class are those that are not hypocorisms, and do not end in -a, which undergo e-type declension.\n\nAccording to the nominative singular forms they are divided in two classes:\n\nMasculine nouns ending in -o or -e present a special case. They generally comprise personal names, hypocorisms and certain foreign-language borrowings.\n\nNeuter nouns end in -\"o\", -\"e\" and -\"∅\".\n\nThe final \"o\" is always a suffix. Nouns which have at least two consonants (except \"st\" and \"zd\") before the final \"o\" have disappearing \"a\" in genitive plural.\n\nThe noun \"dȑvo\" can mean material \"wood\", in which case it is declined as above (without disappearing a); and a living \"tree\", where it can be declined either as above (without disappearing a) or as a non-parisyllabic form below:\n\nWhen the nouns \"ȍko\" and \"ȕho\" mean \"eye\" and \"ear\", except after a number ending with two-to-four, their plurals are feminine; their plurals are neuter otherwise.\n\nNouns \"čȕdo\" \"miracle\", \"kȍlo\" \"wheel\", \"nȅbo\" \"sky\", \"tijêlo\" \"body\" and \"ȕho\" \"ear\", in addition to parisyllabic form plurals without disappearing \"a\", have non-parisyllabic plurals formed by appending -\"es\"- to the base. These plurals are used differently. The nominative plural of \"ȕho\" is \"ušèsa\", and the nominative plural of \"tijêlo\" is \"tjelèsa\".\n\nThe final \"e\" can be a suffix, so the noun is parisyllabic, and it can belong to the noun base, in which case the noun is not parisyllabic. The noun is parisyllabic if it ends with -\"je\" (except \"jáje\" in singular), -\"lje\", -\"nje\" (except \"jȁnje\"), -\"će\", -\"đe\", -\"ce\" (except \"pȕce\" and \"tùce\"), -\"šte\", -\"šće\" or -\"žđe\". The nouns \"môre\" and \"tlȅ\" are also parisyllabic. If a noun has at least two consonants before the final \"e\", it has a disappearing \"a\" in genitive plural. This is not the case if the noun ends with -\"šte\", -\"šće\", -\"žđe\" or -\"je\". Nouns representing living things do not have plural forms, but their plurality is marked with a collective noun formed with -\"ād\" (\"téle\", n. sg. \"singulare tantum\" → \"tȅlād\", f. sg. \"singulare tantum\") or by using a noun formed with -\"ići\" (\"pȉle\", n. sg. \"singulare tantum\" → \"pȉlići\", m. pl.). The noun \"dijéte\" \"child\" is a \"singulare tantum\" and uses the collective noun \"djèca\", f. sg. \"singulare tantum\", but plural with verbs, instead of a plural form.\n\nThe \"pluralia tantum\" nouns \"vráta\", \"ústa\" and \"plúća\" can have the suffix -\"ijū\" in genitive plural: \"vrátijū\", \"ústijū\", \"plúćijū\". The only neuter noun ending in -\"a\" is \"dȍba\"/\"dôba\":\n\nThis type reflects Proto-Slavic a-stems, and is characterized by the ending -a in nominative singular and -ē in genitive singular. It contains most of the feminine nouns, and a small number of masculines.\n\nThis type reflects Proto-Slavic i-stems, and is characterized by the zero ending in nominative singular and -i in genitive singular. It contains the rest of feminine nouns, i.e., those that are not contained in the e-type nouns (a-stems).\n\nSome nouns appear only in the plural form and do not have a singular variant (see plurale tantum). The gender of these nouns is either feminine (e.g. \"hlače\" \"trousers\", \"gaće\" \"pants\", \"grudi\" \"chest\") or neuter (e.g. \"kola\" \"car\", \"leđa\" \"back\", \"usta\" \"mouth\").\n\nSerbo-Croatian allows deletion of the subject pronoun (see pro-drop language). Example:\n\nPersonal pronouns\n\nSome of the declensions for adjectives are the same as for nouns: \"velika \"kuća (sing. fem. nom.), \"veliku \"kuću (sing. fem. acc.). Others differ: \"jednim \"klikom (\"with one click\", sing. masc. instrum.).\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> same as nominative if a word is marking inanimate object; same as genitive if a word is marking animate object.\n\nSingular\n\nPlural\n\n\nLike those of other Slavic languages, Serbo-Croatian verbs have a property of aspect: the \"perfective\" and the \"imperfective\". Perfective indicates an action that is completed or sudden, while the imperfective denotes continuous, repeated, or habitual action. Aspect compensates for a relative lack of tenses compared with e.g. Germanic or Romance languages: the verb already contains the information whether the action is completed or lasting, so there is no general distinction between continuous and perfect tenses.\n\nSlavic verbs in general are characterized by a relatively low number of stems, from which a wide variety of meanings is achieved by prefixation.\n\nThe indicative has seven tenses: present, past, futures I and II, pluperfect, aorist and imperfect. The latter two are not used often in daily speech (more often in Bosnia and Herzegovina than in Croatia and Serbia), especially the imperfect. The present, aorist, and imperfect are inflected, the other tenses are periphrastic:\n\n\nFuture tense can also be formed with (reduced) present of \"хтети\" plus the conjunction \"да\" and the present of the main verb, e.g. \"ћеш да куваш\" in Serbian, but this form is incorrect in Croatian. Also, whereas in Croatian it would be \"radit ćemo\", in Serbian the \"t\" can be omitted and the verbs merged into \"radićemo\".\n\nBesides the indicative, Serbo-Croatian uses the imperative, conditional, and the optative. Imperative forms vary according to the type of the verb, and is formed by adding the appropriate morpheme to a verbal stem. The conditional I (present) uses the aorist of \"biti\" plus perfect participle, while conditional II (past) consists of the perfect participle of \"biti\", the aorist of the same verb, and the perfect participle of the main verb. Some grammars classify future II as a conditional tense, or even a mood of its own.\n\nOptative is in its form identical to the perfect participle. It is used by speakers to express a strong wish, e.g. \"Živio predsjednik!\" 'Long live the president!', \"Dabogda ti se sjeme zatrlo!\" (an archaic and dialectal curse), etc. The optative may be translated into English by an imperative construction, with set phrases (such as the already exemplified 'long live'), or by use of the modal verb \"may\".\n\nSome authors suggest existence of subjunctive mood, realized as \"da\" plus the present of indicative, but most grammars treat it as present indicative.\n\nVerbal aspect is distinguished in English by using the simple or progressive (continuous) forms. 'He washed the dishes' indicates that the action was finished; 'He was washing the dishes' indicates that the action was ongoing (progressive). Serbo-Croatian, like all Slavic languages, has the aspect built into the verbs, rather than expressing it with different tenses.\n\nTo compare the meanings of the different aspects with verbal aspect in English, one should know three basic aspects: completed (may be called preterit, aorist, or perfect according to the language in question), progressive (on-going but not completed yet, durative), and iterative (habitual or repeated). English uses one aspect for completed and iterative and another for progressive. Serbo-Croatian uses one for completed and another for iterative and progressive.\n\nAspect is the most challenging part of Serbo-Croatian grammar. Although aspect exists in all other Slavic languages, learners of Serbo-Croatian who already know even one of several other Slavic languages may never learn to use aspect correctly, though they will be understood with only rare problems. While there are bi-aspectual verbs as well, primarily those derived by adding the suffix \"-irati\" or \"-ovati\", the majority of verbs not derived in such a manner are either perfective (\"svršeni\") or imperfective (\"nesvršeni\"). Almost all of the single aspectual verbs are part of a perfective–imperfective pair of verbs. When learning a verb, one must learn its verbal aspect, and the other verb for the opposite verbal aspect, e.g. \"prati\" (\"to wash\", imperfective) goes with \"oprati\" (\"to wash\", perfective). The pairing, however, is not always one to one: some verbs simply don't have a counterpart on a semantic level, such as \"izgledati\" (\"seem\") or \"sadržati\" (\"contain\"). In others, there are several perfective alternatives with slightly different meanings.\n\nThere are two paradigms concerning formation of verb pairs. In one paradigm, the base verb is imperfective, such as \"prati\" (\"to wash\"). In this case the perfective is formed by adding a \"prefix\", in this case \"o\", as in \"oprati\". In the other paradigm, the root verb is perfective, and the imperfective is formed either by modifying the root: \"dignuti\"→\"dizati\" (\"to lift\") or adding an interfix \"stati\"→\"stajati\" (\"to stop\", \"to stand\").\n\nA pattern which often arises can be illustrated with \"pisati\", \"to write\". \"Pisati\" is imperfective, so a prefix is needed to make it perfective, in this case \"na-\": napisati\". But if other prefixes are added, modifying the meaning, the verb becomes perfective: zapisati\" (\"to write down\") or prepisati\" (\"to copy by hand\"). Since these basic verbs are perfective, an interfix is needed to make them imperfective: \"zapisivati\" and \"prepisivati\". In some cases, this could be continued by adding a prefix: pozapisivati\" and \"isprepisivati\" which are again perfective.\n\nThere are three conjugations of verbs:\n\nAs in most other Indo-European languages including English, the Indo-European copula ('to be') is used as an auxiliary verb. It is universally irregular, because conjugations of two proto-forms \"*h1es-\" (>English \"is\") and \"*bʰuH-\" (>English \"be\") merged, producing mixed paradigms: the former being used in the present, and the latter in the other tenses. In Serbo-Croatian, however, there are two present forms surviving: \"jesam\" ('I am') and \"budem\" ('I be'). Because of that dualism, some grammars (chiefly Serbian ones) treat \"jesam\" as a defective verb having only present tense. Others treat these forms as two realizations of the same irregular verb \"biti\", \"jesam\" being imperfective and \"budem\" perfective.\n\n\"Jesam\" has the following declension in the present tense. It has long and clitic (short) forms (without leading \"je\"), while its negative form is written as one word, unlike other verbs (compare English \"is\"–\"isn't\"). The short and the negative forms are used as auxiliary, while the long form is marked.\n\nThe copulative use of the verb \"јеsam\" matches that of the verb \"to be\" in English (e.g. He \"is\" a student – On \"је\" učenik), of course, in the present tense only. The 'true' forms present of the verb \"biti\", (\"budem\") have a limited use (in formation of the future exact tense, or in conditional clauses referring to the future, e.g. \"ako budem\" – \"if I am\").\n\nVerb \"biti\" is conjugated as follows:\n\nThe conjugation system of regular verbs is rather complex. There are several classes of verbs distinguished according to certain features verbs within a class share.<br>\nThe verb is raditi (\"To work\")\n\nThis paradigm applies to verbs such as:<br>\n\"vidjeti\" (to see)<br>\"hodati\" (to walk)<br> \"pričati\" (to talk)<br> \"morati\" (must)\n\nIrregular verbs are more complex to conjugate than regular verbs, for example the verb moći (\"can, to be able to\")\n\nAdverbs in Serbo-Croatian are, unlike nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns and numbers, and like prepositions, conjunctions, exclamations and particles, immutable words. Adverbs are, thus, immutable words given to verbs to determine the time, place, manner, cause, point and the amount of the action of the verb. There are seven types of adverbs in Serbo-Croatian:\n\nPlace adverbs (\"\") answer the questions where? (\"gdje?\"), to where? (\"kamo?\"), which way? (\"kuda?\"), from where? (\"otkuda?, odakle?\") and to where? (\"dokle?, dokud?\"). Examples for each type are:\n\nTemporal adverbs, or \"vremenski prilozi\", answer the questions when? (kada?), from when? (otkad?), until when? (dokad?). Examples are: kada (when) - sada (now), tada (then), nikada (never), ponekad (sometimes),uvijek (always), jučer (yesterday), danas (today), sutra (tomorrow), prekosutra (the day after tomorrow), lani (last year), večeras (tonight), odmah/smjesta (now/at once), zatim (then), uskoro (soon), napokon (at last); otkad (from when) - odsad (from now on), oduvijek (from always - oduvijek sam te volio - I have (from) always loved you); dokad (until when) - dosad (until now), dogodine (next year).\n\nEach preposition has an assigned case. If an inflectable word follows a preposition, the word is declined in the same case as the preposition's assigned case.\n\nGenitive prepositions:\nDative prepositions:\nAccusative prepositions:\nLocative prepositions:\nInstrumental prepositions:\n\nDynamic v. Static\nSome prepositions fall in two or more cases. The ones that fall in both the accusative and locative cases, the preposition is accusative if it is dynamic and is locative if it is static. Dynamic means that the preposition shows motion while static does not.\n\nExamples:\n\nSerbo-Croatian has a rich case structure that is reflected in the declension of nouns and adjectives. That allows for a great deal of freedom in word order. In English, for example, the word order shows a difference in meaning between \"Man bites dog\" and \"Dog bites man\". In Serbo-Croatian, \"Čovjek grize psa\" and \"Čovjeka grize pas\" have the same word order, but the meanings are shown by the noun endings. Any order of the three constituents is grammatically correct, and the meaning is clear because of the declensions. However, the usual order is subject–verb–object, as in English.\n\nSerbo-Croatian closely observes Wackernagel's Law that clitics (unstressed functional words) are placed in the second position in all clauses. The first element may be a single word or a noun phrase: \"Taj je čovjek rekao\", \"That man (has) said\", or \"Taj čovjek je rekao'. Multiple clitics are grouped in the following fixed order:\n\nRelative clauses are frequent in modern Serbo-Croatian since they have expanded as attributes at the expense of the participles performing that function.\n\nThe most frequent relativizer is the relative pronoun \"koji\". It has the greatest range of antecedents, which, however, are mostly nouns or personal pronouns. Nouns are the word class with attributes, and the relative clause is most frequently an attributive clause. The frequency of the adjectival pronoun \"koji\" is greater than those relative pronouns that cannot have an antecedent noun (\"tko\" ʻwhoʼ and the declinable type of \"što\" 'what'). Also, it occurs much more frequently than other adjectival relative pronouns: in comparison with their specialized semantic functions such as possessiveness (\"čiji\" 'whose'), quality (\"kakav\" 'what sort of') or quantity (\"koliki\" 'how large'), the pronoun \"koji\" has the broadest scope of reference and identification with the referent.\n\n\n"}

A skip distance is a distance on the Earth's surface between the two points where radio waves from a transmitter, refracted downwards by different layers of the ionosphere, fall. It also represents how far a radio wave has travelled per hop on the Earth's surface, for radio waves such as the short wave (SW) radio signals that employ continuous reflections for transmission.\n\nRadio waves from a particular transmitting antenna do not all get refracted by a particular layer of the ionosphere; some are absorbed, some refracted while a portion escapes to the next layer. At this higher layer, there is a possibility of this radio wave being bent downwards to earth again. This bending happens because each layer of the ionosphere has a refractive index that varies from that of the others. Because of the differing heights of refraction, or apparent reflection, the radio waves hit the earth surface at different points hence generating the skip distance. Skip distance is greatest during the night when the ionosphere is the highest.\n\n\nMaximum usable frequency\n"}

The story is labeled with its slug as it makes its way from the reporter through the editorial process. The AP Stylebook prescribes its use by wire reporters (in a \"keyword slugline\") as follows: \"The keyword or slug (sometimes more than one word) clearly indicates the content of the story.\" Sometimes a slug also contains code information that tells editors specific information about the story — for example, the letters \"AM\" at the beginning of a slug on a wire story tell editors that the story is meant for morning papers, while the letters \"CX\" indicate that the story is a correction to an earlier story.\n\nIn the production process of print advertisements, a slug or slug line, refers to the \"name\" of a particular advertisement. Advertisements usually have several markers, ad numbers or job numbers and slug lines. Usually the slug references the offer or headline and is used to differentiate between different ad runs.\n\nThe origin of the term slug derives from the days of hot-metal printing, when printers set type by hand in a small form called a stick. Later huge Linotype machines turned molten lead into casts of letters, lines, sentences and paragraphs. A line of lead in both eras was known as a slug.\n\n"}
{"id": "35630390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35630390", "title": "Stripping (linguistics)", "text": "Stripping (linguistics)\n\nStripping or bare argument ellipsis is an ellipsis mechanism that elides everything from a clause except one constituent. It occurs exclusively in the non-initial conjuncts of coordinate structures. One prominent analysis of stripping sees it as a particular manifestation of the gapping mechanism, the difference between stripping and gapping lies merely with the number of remnants left behind by ellipsis: gapping leaves two (and sometimes more) constituents behind, whereas stripping leaves just one. Stripping occurs in many languages and is a frequent occurrence in colloquial conversation. As with many other ellipsis mechanisms, stripping challenges theories of syntax in part because the elided material often fails to qualify as a constituent in a straightforward manner.\n\nThe following examples illustrate standard cases of stripping. The elided material is indicated using smaller font size and subscripts.\n\nNote the appearance of the additive particle \"too\" in these examples. Stripping is often marked by \"also\", \"as well\", or \"too\". Notice also the appearance of the coordinator \"and\" or \"or\". The coordinator's appearance marks coordination. Each time, the elided material appears in the non-initial conjunct of the coordinate structure. A trait that stripping shares with gapping is illustrated with the following examples:\n\nLike gapping, stripping allows the object form of the pronoun (= disjunctive pronoun) to function as the subject in the stripped clause. A second trait that stripping shares with gapping is shown with the following examples:\n\nLike the gapped verbs, the stripped verbs in these examples do not match their antecedents in the area of verbal inflection. The fact that gapping and stripping are alike in these respects does indeed suggest that they are one and the same ellipsis mechanism.\n\nA particularly frequent type of stripping is \"not\"-stripping. The remnant in the stripped clause is introduced by \"not\" and the entire sentence functions to correct a mistaken assumption in the preceding context. More often than not, the coordinator is omitted:\n\nA noteworthy aspect of \"not\"-stripping is the position of \"not\". In the full versions of these sentences (i.e. without stripping), \"not\" cannot appear in the positions shown. When stripping occurs, the \"not\" must immediately precede the one remnant. Given this observation, one might conclude that stripping does not really involve ellipsis at all, but rather something else is going on. This conclusion is undermined by further facts. One of these facts is that the behavior of \"not\" is the same in cases of \"not\"-gapping:\n\nThese examples of \"not\"-gapping suggest two things: that \"not\"-stripping, and thus stripping in general, is indeed a particular manifestation of the gapping mechanism and that \"not\"-stripping is also indeed ellipsis, since the ellipsis analysis of \"not\"-gapping is the only plausible analysis. The aspect of \"not\"-stripping that remains mysterious concerns the obligatory position of \"not\" before the (first) remnant. One can note in this area that the gapping/stripping mechanism treats the negation in a special way in general. A negation cannot be included in the gapped/stripped material:\n\nLike with gapping, delimiting instances of stripping from \"normal\" instances of coordination, i.e. from instances of coordination that do not involve ellipsis, can be difficult, as the following competing analyses illustrate:\n\nThe brackets mark the extent of the coordinate structures. The distinction between the stripping and non-stripping analyses can be slight. Given a single intonation curve, the non-gapping analysis seems better, but if a pause occurs immediately before the coordinator (as marked by the comma) and an additive particle appears (e.g. \"too\", \"also\", \"as well\"), then the stripping analysis becomes more plausible.\n\nThe distinction between the two analyses explains the ambiguity in the sentence \"Do you want coffee or tea?\":\n\nAs with most ellipsis mechanisms, theoretical accounts of stripping face significant challenges. The greatest challenge is to come up with a coherent explanation of the stripped material. The insight that the remnant of stripping is always a constituent is straightforward. The difficulties arise when one attempts to discern which individual constituents can and cannot be a remnant. For instance, why are the remnants in the following cases disallowed?:\n\nThe remnants in these examples are constituents in constituency grammars (= phrase structure grammars), since every individual word is by definition a constituent in constituency grammars. These words are not, however, constituents in dependency grammars, since they dominate other (elided) material. The constituency vs. dependency distinction is therefore one avenue that one might pursue to locate an explanation of such cases. If one chooses a constituency-based grammar, however, then the explanation might draw attention to the distinction between projection levels (see X-bar theory): the remnant must qualify as a maximal projection (as opposed to an intermediate or minimal projection).\n\nAnother avenue to explore for an explanation is to focus on the elided material (as opposed to on the remnant). In most cases, the elided material cannot be characterized as a constituent. It can, however, be characterized as a catena. The following dependency grammar trees illustrate this explanation in terms of catenae. The elided material is indicated with a lighter font shade:\n\nThe elided word combinations form chains (=catenae), that is, the elided words are linked together by dependencies in the vertical dimension. The word combinations \"do you want\" and he \"said...that he knew it\" are catenae. These two examples must be compared to the following two:\n\nThese sentences are bad, and one can explain their badness by acknowledging the status of the elided words as non-catenae; the elided words are not entirely linked together in the vertical dimension. The object pronoun \"it\" in the a-tree and the indefinite article \"an\" in the b-tree are not linked directly to the other elided material. This observation may explain why these attempts at stripping fail. The elided material should qualify as a catena.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56563697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56563697", "title": "Swahili grammar", "text": "Swahili grammar\n\nSwahili grammar is typical for Bantu languages, bearing all the hallmarks of this language family. These include agglutinativity, a rich array of noun classes, extensive inflection for person (both subject and object), tense, aspect and mood, and generally a subject–verb–object word order.\n\nSwahili may be described in several ways depending on the aspect being considered.\n\nSwahili nouns are grouped into noun classes based on the prefix they have, with each class having a prescribed number. For example, the nouns \"wasichana\" \"girls\" and \"wasimamizi\" \"overseers\" belong to class 2, characterised by the prefix \"wa-\", whereas \"kifuniko\" \"lid, cover\" and \"kisukari\" \"diabetes\" belong to class 7, characterised by the prefix \"ki-\". The classes 5, 9 and 10 are frequently without any prefix. The numbers are based on the classes reconstructed for Proto-Bantu, and have corresponding classes in the other Bantu languages which can be identified by the same system of numbers. Therefore, classes that are missing in Swahili create a gap in the numbering, as is the case with classes above 18 as well as classes 12, 13, which are absent in standard Swahili (although do frequently occur in non-standard varieties).\n\nWhen discussing Swahili noun classes, it is important to distinguish between (1) \"morphological\" noun classes as a quality of the noun themselves indicated by morphological features (generally prefixes), and (2) \"syntactic\" noun classes as an agreement (i.e. concord) paradigm affecting the use of other words in the sentence. Here, \"noun class\" is used with the former meaning. Morphological and syntactic noun classes often diverge, especially when it comes to nouns referring to people and animals which do not belong to the morphological noun class 1/2, signalled by \"m-wa.\" For more information, see concord.\n\nThe following noun classes exist:\n\n\nEvery class up to 11 can be regarded as inherently singular or plural. Odd-numbered classes are singular, even-numbered classes are plural. The plural of a noun is normally formed by switching it to the next higher class. Thus, the plural of class 1 \"mtu\" \"person\" is class 2 \"watu\" \"people\". For class 11 nouns, the plural is in class 10. Class 14 usually has no plural at all, but in rare instances class 6 is used to form a plural for these nouns, for example \"ugonjwa\" \"sickness, disease\", \"magonjwa\" \"diseases\". Class 6 also contains a lot of nouns for liquids, such as \"maji\" \"water\", and other nouns derived from verbs such as \"mazungumzo\" \"conversation(s)\". Aside from these, there are some nouns in other classes that do not change class to indicate number, such as \"mchana\" \"afternoon(s)\", \"daytime\" (class 3), \"vita\" \"war(s)\" (class 8), \"usiku\" \"night(s)\" (class 14), and these can be shown as singular or plural only by surrounding context.\n\nIn terms of meaning, groups of similar nouns tend to belong to similar noun classes. For example, nouns for people, including agent nouns, are commonly in classes 1/2, while animals are often in classes 9/10. Nouns describing plants are in class 3/4 and if they produce fruit, it will probably be in class 5/6. Abstract nouns are often in class 14, loanwords in classes 9/10 and 5/6. Many nouns for liquids are in class 6. Infinitives/gerunds of verbs are in class 15. Diminutives as well as the words for many man-made tools and languages are in class 7/8. These are only generalisations and there are exceptions in most classes.\n\nThe class of the noun determines the forms of other parts of speech that relate to it, such as verbs, adjectives, etc. This process is called agreement or concord. These other parts of speech receive their own concordant prefixes (termed \"concords\" for short), generally matching in class with the noun, though the prefixes themselves are not always the same. In the examples below, the left and right sides of the table show sentences with a singular and then plural subject respectively.\n\nAnimate nouns (i.e. those referring to people or animals) which are not in classes 1/2 generally take the agreement prefixes (concords) from classes 1/2 as if they did belong to it.\n\nAnimacy agreements can often distinguish different meanings of the same noun, such as \"ndege\", which means \"bird(s)\" when animate and \"aeroplane(s)\" when inanimate.\n\nAnimate nouns in classes 9/10 may exhibit a slight aberration from this pattern. The genitive pronominal forms \"-angu\", \"-ako\", \"-ake\", \"-etu\", \"-enu\" and \"-ao\" are frequently inflected with a group of nouns referring to close human relationships with their appropriate class 9/10 concords, regardless of the fact that they are animate (giving \"yangu\", \"yako\", \"yetu\" etc. in singular and \"zangu\", \"zako\", \"zetu\" etc. in plural). For some speakers, the same rule applies to the simple genitive preposition \"-a\" (giving \"ya\" in singular and \"za\" in plural), however for most speakers \"wa\" is used for all animate nouns regardless of number or class. Other parts of speech are unaffected by this exception.\n\nNouns which follow this pattern of agreement include \"mama\" \"mother(s)\", \"baba\" \"father(s)\", \"ndugu\" \"sibling(s)/relative(s)\", \"kaka\" \"(elder) brother(s)\", \"dada\" \"(elder) sister(s)\", \"nyanya\" \"grandmother(s)\", \"bibi\" \"grandmother(s)\", \"babu\" \"grandfather(s)\", \"shangazi\" \"paternal aunt(s)\", \"shemeji\" \"sister(s)/brother(s)-in-law\", \"wifi\" \"sister(s)-in-law\", \"jamaa\" \"relative(s)\", \"rafiki\" \"friend(s)\", \"shoga\" \"female friend of a woman\", \"jirani\" \"neighbour\" and \"adui\" \"enemy\".\n\nNouns of this group, such as \"rafiki\" \"friend\", may optionally take a plural prefix \"ma-\" as though belonging to class 5/6, although their concords remain the same mix of class 1/2 and 9/10.\n\nIn addition, animals of classes 9/10 generally take class 1 agreement throughout the singular, but may take 10 agreement on pronominal genitive words in the plural.\n\nAnother departure from the rule of animate nouns taking concords in classes 1/2 occurs on occasion with diminutives and augmentatives, whereby using concords of the class the noun belongs to (5/6 for augmentatives, 7/8 for diminutives) emphasises the dimunition or augmentation.\n\nA locative noun is a derived noun that indicate a location associated with the base noun from which it is derived. The change in meaning can translate to a variety of English prepositions indicating location, such as \"in\", \"at\", \"on\", \"to\" or \"from\", and is thus quite general in meaning, with the exact meaning of the phrase generally being determined by the verb.\n\nThe Arabic loan noun \"mahali\" \"place\" (and its variations: \"pahali\", \"mahala\" and \"pahala\") is the only noun which inherently belongs to the locative class. Other nouns can be made locative by adding the suffix \"-ni\" to the end, although this is not available for proper nouns referring to places, any animate nouns, recent loanwords and some other arbitrary nouns.\n\nBecause locative nouns constitute three classes of their own, they cannot take the usual concords of the noun they have been derived from. The concords themselves show in which one of the locative classes the noun is being used. Class 16 is marked by concords based on \"pa-\" and indicates specific location. Class 17, with concords based on \"ku-\" indicates a more general location. Class 18 has concords based on \"mu-\" and indicates internal location.\n\n\nThe equivalent of compound words are usually formed using the genitive construction such as \"mpira wa kikapu\" \"basketball\" (literally \"ball of basket\"). This is similar to the compounding process found in many languages such as French \"fin de semaine\" \"weekend\" (literally \"end of week\").\n\nThere are also many compounds which do not use the genitive preposition \"-a\". In these cases, two (or more) nouns are simply placed side by side.\n\nThe word order is the reverse of most compounds in English, with the head always preceding the modifiers in Swahili; in other words, the first noun describes \"what\" it is, and any subsequent noun narrows or specifies that description. For example, the class 9/10 noun \"punda\" \"donkey(s)\" is followed by the class 4 noun \"milia\" \"stripes\" to mean \"zebra\". Whereas in English, a hypothetical equivalent compound would place the noun for the stripes first and also require the singular: \"stripe-donkey\", the word for \"donkey\" appears first in Swahili.\n\nThere is a good deal of variation among different authors as to whether the nouns are written together, hyphenated or separated and thus the word for \"zebra(s)\" may appear as any of \"pundamilia\", \"punda-milia\" or \"punda milia\".\n\nA few common compound words have irregular plural forms because number marking occurs on both elements. The word mwanamke\" \"woman\" becomes wanawake\" \"women\" in plural. Similarly, mwanamume\" \"man\" becomes wanaume\" \"men\" in plural, although the singular form \"mwanaume\" is also common. These two nouns are formed from the word \"mwana\" \"son, daughter\", which is commonly used in compounds to essentially mean \"person\", followed by the words \"mke\" \"wife\" (plural: \"wake\") and \"mume\" \"husband\" (plural: \"waume\") respectively.\n\nPronouns behave in many ways like nouns, having both plural and singular forms, being present in the full range of noun classes but no inflection for case, meaning that, for instance, there is no difference between \"we\" and \"us\", which are both \"sisi\".\n\nPersonal pronouns occur in two forms: an independent form, which is used as a word alone, and a combining stem, which is used when combined with words such as \"na\" \"with, and\" and \"ndi-\" \"it is\". The independent form consists, in all cases except for \"wao\", of a reduplication of a syllable. \"Nyinyi\", however, may alternatively be dissimilated to \"ninyi\". These pronouns also have a separate genitive (possessive) stem, which is the combining stem that is used when a genitive prefix is added.\n\nNote that the sex/gender of referents is not distinguished, with \"yeye\" capable of meaning either \"he\" or \"she\". These pronouns are, however, restricted to use with animate referents, i.e. people or animals, so it does not generally mean \"it\". The genitive form \"-ake\" has no such restriction and may mean \"his\", \"hers\" or \"its\" depending on context.\n\nSwahili is a pro-drop language. As the verb usually already includes prefixes to indicate the subject and object, personal pronouns aren't strictly needed, and are mostly used for emphasis. The exceptions to this include cases when the copula \"ni\" (or its negative counterpart \"si\") is used, as well as with the habitual form of the verb, which lacks subject prefixes.\n\nIn informal speech, when pronouns are unstressed, they may appear in a reduced form, such as \"mi\" or \"mie\" for \"mimi\". This mainly occurs when the pronoun is not added only for emphasis, but is needed (e.g. \"mi ni\" \"I am\", informally), and this also frequently occurs where the first person singular subject prefix \"ni-\" is dropped in casual speech before \"-na-\". For example, standard \"(mimi) ninajua\" \"I know\" often occurs as (\"mi) najua\" in spoken Swahili.\n\nDeterminers in Swahili are capable of being used adjectivally (with a noun) or pronominally (standing in for an absent noun). The inflection of Swahili determiners resembles that of verbs.\n\nThere are no articles in Swahili. A word such as \"kitabu\" \"book\" may be taken to mean either \"the book\" or \"a book\" depending on context. If the distinction must be made demonstratives or adjectives may be used to provide various shades of meaning such as \"kitabu hicho\" \"that (aforementioned) book\", \"kitabu kimoja\" \"one book\", \"kitabu fulani\" \"some (particular) book\", \"kitabu chochote\" \"any book (at all)\".\n\nThe demonstratives in Swahili may be used either as adjectives, with a noun, or as pronouns, standing alone. They occur in three types:\n\nThere is one pronoun of each type for each noun class. There is also a combining form that appears suffixed on certain other words such as \"na\" and \"ndi-\". This combining form is identical to the relative marker for each class.\n\nThe demonstratives may stand alone, as true pronouns, but may also be used in combination with a noun, much like \"this\" and \"that\" in English. The demonstrative generally follows the noun but it can also precede. Before a noun, it often takes on a slightly more article-like role.\n\nThe words \"-ote\" \"all\", \"-o-ote\" \"any\", \"-pi\" \"which\" and \"-enyewe\" \"-self\", \"-selves\"\",\" appear with prefixes following the verbal inflection pattern. In older texts, \"-o-ote\" was frequently written as two words (e.g. \"ye yote\", \"vyo vyote\") however it is now more frequently written together. For the sake of comparison, the following table also includes the genitive and ornative prepositions \"-a\" and \"-enye\" as well as the verbal subject prefixes for each class. Note that class 1 has the most irregularity and diversity of form.\n\n\nThe term \"adjective\", as applied to Swahili and most other Bantu languages, usually applies only to a rather restricted set of words. However, in the wider sense, it can refer to any word that modifies a noun. The wider sense is used here. Adjectives in the stricter Bantu sense are referred to as \"true adjectives\" in this article. True adjectives in Swahili may be divided into two categories: \"inflecting adjectives\", which take a prefix indicating the noun class of their referent, and \"invariable adjectives\", which do not take a prefix.\n\nAll adjectives have one thing in common: they all follow the noun they modify, and, aside from the plain adjectives, require some kind of prefix whose class matches the preceding noun. The different types of adjectives reflect the different prefixes that are used:\n\nInflecting adjectives are words which describe a noun or pronoun and take the following prefixes, which are very similar to the prefixes found on nouns. This distinguishes them from determiners, which take prefixes similar to those on verbs. The most notable departure from the nominal inflection pattern among inflecting adjectives is the replacement of the nominal \"u-\" prefix in class 11 (and generally also 14) with the adjectival \"m-\" prefix. The locative classes also carry prefixes, unlike the locative nouns they refer to.\n\nMost inflecting adjectives have stems beginning with a consonant. Of those that begin with a vowel, almost all of these have stems that begin with either \"e\" (for example, \"-ekundu\" \"red\") or \"i\" (eg. \"-ingi\" \"many, much\"). A very small minority of adjectives begin with other vowels, but these happen to refer only to animate referents and thus only have forms in classes 1 and 2, for example: \"-ovu\" \"evil, wicked\", which is mwovu\" in class 1 and waovu\" in class 2.\nThe adjective \"-ingine\" \"other\", is sometimes given inflections prefixes of the type found with determiners, following a verbal rather than a nominal pattern. Most notably, the forms lingine in class six, ingine or yingine in class 9 and zingine in class 10 may be heard. Some speakers also use an e in these classes:\" jengine, lengine, nyengine, yengine and\" zengine sometimes occurring. These forms are regarded as non-standard, although they may be commonly heard. The standard forms of each are jingine for class 6 and nyingine for classes 9 and 10.\n\nThe numerals \"-moja\" \"one\", \"-wili\" \"two\", \"-tatu\" \"three\", \"-nne\" \"four\", \"-tano\" \"five\" and \"-nane\" \"eight\", as well as all numbers that end with these words, take prefixes as inflecting adjectives do. \n\nInvariable adjectives are mostly loanwords from Arabic, such as \"safi\" \"clean\", \"ghali\" \"expensive\", although loanwords from other languages are also present, such as \"faini\", from English \"fine\". Nouns placed as modifiers after other nouns may also be regarded as invariable adjectives, such as \"msichana kiziwi\" \"Deaf girl\", which has a class 1 prefix \"m-\" and a class 7 prefix \"ki-\". Numbers loaned from Arabic: \"sita\" \"six\", \"saba\" \"seven\" and \"tisa\" \"nine\", \"ishirini\" \"twenty\", etc., as well as the native Bantu number \"kumi\" \"ten\", function as invariable adjectives. The interrogative adjective \"gani\" \"what kind of\" or, colloquially, \"which\" is also invariable.\n\nRelatives are verbs used as adjectives by being relativised using a relative prefix (or suffix) which agrees with the noun's class.\nThese are frequently used in Swahili and make up for the relative paucity of \"true adjectives\". For example, there are no true adjectives equivalent to the English adjectives \"open\" and \"dead\", however the verbs \"kufa\" \"to die\" and \"kufunguliwa\" \"to be opened\", when relativised, convey these meanings. Examples of this in use:\n\nAnother construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the genitive construction using the genitive preposition \"-a\". The prefixes that this preposition takes are outlined here.\n\nIn many cases, the noun introduced in an genitive adjective phrase receives an additional \"ki-\" prefix, such as \"-a kimataifa\" \"international\" (from \"mataifa\" \"nations\") and \"-a kihistoria\" \"historic\" (from \"historia\" \"history\").\n\nYet another construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the ornative construction using \"-enye\". Some examples of adjectival phrases with \"-enye\" include \"-enye nguvu\" \"strong\" (with strength), \"-enye nywele fupi\" \"short-haired\" (having short hair), and \"-enye senta moja\" \"concentric\" (having one centre). The forms of \"-enye\" as well as some more examples of use can be seen here.\n\nLike nouns, verbs are formed by adding prefixes to a basic stem. However, unlike the prefixes of nouns, verbal prefixes are not a fixed part of the verb, but indicate subject, object, tense, aspect, mood and other inflectional categories. Normally, verbs are cited in dictionaries in the stem form, often with a hyphen to indicate that prefixes are added, such as \"-sema\" \"say\", \"-andika\" \"to write\", \"-la\" \"to eat\". It is also possible to use the infinitive/gerund form which begins with \"ku-\" or, for a couple of verbs only, \"kw-\", such as \"kusema\" \"to say\", \"kuandika\" \"to write\", \"kula\" \"to eat\".\n\nPrefixes are always attached in a fixed order; the object prefix always comes last, immediately before the verb stem, while the subject prefix comes before the object prefix. Most of the time, a tense, aspect, mood or polarity prefix may intervene between the subject and object prefix, or be placed before the subject prefix. A common mnemonic used by learners of Swahili for the order of parts of a verb is STROVE.\n\n\nIn learner materials, all types of prefixes other than the subject prefixes are frequently, erroneously referred to as infixes. It should, however, be noted that the term \"infix\", as used by linguists, refers only to a morpheme (≈ part of a word) that is inserted \"within\" another morpheme, not simply in between other morphemes within a word. Under the strict definition of the word, Swahili does not make use of infixes.\n\nHere is an example of a verb with all slots filled:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> This \"(a)\" appears when this is the final element of the word and is otherwise dropped.\n\nMost of the time, verbs will not have all slots filled. Here are some other examples.\n\nThere are a number of derivational suffixes (frequently termed 'extensions') which can be added to the end of verbs to derive new meanings, some of which have been shown above.\n\nThere are three basic inflection groups which differ only very slightly from one another:\nCommon verbs are the largest group of verbs in Swahili. In their infinitive form, they consist of three or more syllables and end with \"-a\". All verbs of native Bantu origin end with \"-a\", including the short verbs mentioned below. Some examples of common verbs are \"kuanguka\" \"to fall\", \"kufanya\" \"to do, to make\", \"kuona\" \"to see\", \"kuwaza\" \"to think\", \"kusaidia\" \"to help\". The final \"-a\" is replaced with another vowel in certain grammatical contexts, becoming \"-i\" in the present negative, and \"-e\" in the subjunctive and imperative forms involving an object prefix. The plural address marker \"-ni\" also triggers this final \"-a\" to become \"-e.\"\n\nShort verbs are those which, in their infinitive form, consist of only two syllables, such as \"kula\" \"to eat\", \"kunywa\" \"to drink\", \"kuja\" \"to come\", \"kupa\" \"to give\". The verbs \"kwenda\" \"to go\" and \"kwisha\" \"to finish\" may belong to this group, although it is also common for these verbs to be conjugated as common verbs (as \"kuenda\" and \"kuisha\"). Because the stems of most of these verbs, once the infinitive prefix \"ku-\" is removed, are monosyllabic, these are frequently termed monosyllabic verbs, however this is problematic as the final \"-a\" of Bantu verbs is often not considered to be part of the root (meaning that roots of many of these verbs consists of only a single consonant or consonant cluster, such as \"-p-\" \"give\"). Furthermore, when the final \"-a\" is considered part of the stem, this excludes \"-enda\" and \"-isha\", which generally conjugate in a similar way to the other short verbs. The short verbs are all native Bantu verbs ending in \"-a\" and undergo the same \"-i\" and \"-e\" alterations as the common verbs. Additionally, they are characterised by the insertion (or retention) of the syllable \"-ku-\" in certain verb forms. This intrusive \"-ku-\" (which may be glossed as for \"extension\") prevents the penultimate stress from falling on certain TAM prefixes (-\"na-\", \"-me-\", \"-li-\", \"-ta-\", \"-sha-\", \"-nge-\", \"-ngeli-\") and relative prefixes, which are inherently unable be stressed. This \"-ku-\" disappears in verb forms where the stress is allowed to fall on a subject or object prefix, or on certain other TAM prefixes (\"-a-\", \"hu-\", \"-ki-\", \"-ka-\", \"-ku-\", \"-si-\"). (The TAM prefix \"-ja-\" can be regarded as belonging to either group, depending on the speaker.) Because the initial stem vowel of \"-enda\" and \"-isha\" takes the stress, this explanation does not sufficiently fit, however it should suffice to say that the distribution of their \"-kw-\" extension, among speakers who use it, is identical to that of the \"-ku-\" extension in other short verbs.\n\nThe Loan verbs, also frequently called \"Arabic\" verbs, are those which do not end in \"-a\" in the infinitive. Not all verbs, from Arabic are in this group, however, such as \"kusaidia\", which is an Arabic loan which happens to end in \"-a\" and is thus declined as a common verb. Likewise, not all Loan verbs come from Arabic, such as \"kukisi\" \"to kiss\" and \"kuripoti\" \"to report\", which are from English. What these verbs share in common is that they are all loan-words and none of them end in \"-a\". The consequence of this is that they do not take the suffixes \"-e\" and \"-i\" that the verbs ending in \"-a\" do, which occasionally results in ambiguity, such as in \"si-ku-sahau-Ø\" which could either mean \"I did not forget\" (NEG.1S-NEG.PST-forget-Ø) or \"I do not forget you\" (NEG.1s-2s-forget-PRES.NEG).\n\nBoth the subject and, when applicable, the object of the verb are indicated by \"prefixes\" or \"concords\" attached to the verb stem. Swahili is a pro-drop language: explicit personal pronouns are only used for emphasis, or with verb forms that do not indicate subject or object. When a noun is used as the subject or object, then the concord must match its class. Animate nouns (referring to a person or animal) are an exception and these occur with concords of the noun classes 1 (singular) or 2 (plural). The subject concord must always be present, except in the infinitive, habitual and imperative forms. The object concord is generally optional; although some sources maintain that it must always be used with animate objects, this appears not to be the case as counter-examples are commonplace. Whether it is used or not appears to have to do with animacy, specificity and definiteness as well as pragmatic considerations of emphasis.\n\nSix different forms of verbal concord exist.\n\nFor the subject, there are both negative and positive forms, while there are only positive forms for objects. The negative subject concords are formed by prefixing the syllable \"ha-\" to the beginning, except for the irregular forms \"si-\" (instead of \"*hani-\"), \"hu-\" (instead of \"*hau-\") and \"ha-\" (instead of \"*haa-\") which are used, respectively, for first, second and third person singular animate subjects.\n\nAdditionally, in (the third person singular of) noun class 1, the prefix \"yu-\" is used instead of \"a-\" as the subject of a locative copula. (This \"yu-\" can also be seen in the demonstratives.) The negative form of \"yu-\" is formed regularly, by appending the prefix \"ha-\".\n\nBefore the present 'indefinite' marker \"-a-\", subject concords are shortened to just a consonant or consonant cluster in a similar manner to the prefix which occur on the genitive preposition \"-a\".\n\nObject concords are generally the same as the positive subject concord, although there are a few exceptions for instances involving animate referents; 2nd person singular and plural, as well as 3rd person singular (class 1) all have different forms for subject and object concord.\n\nExamples:\n\nBecause the 2nd person plural object prefix \"-wa-\" is the same as the object prefix for class 2 (3rd person plural object), a word such as \"ninawaona\" may ambiguously mean \"I see you all\" or \"I see them.\" These two possibilities may be disambiguated by placing the pronoun after the verb: \"ninawaona ninyi / wao. Very frequently, however, the suffix \"-eni\" is appended to the verb to indicate that the second person plural is meant: \"ninawaoneni \"I see you all.\" This suffix causes the final \"a\" of Bantu verbs to shift to \"e\". On loan verbs, this suffix is simply \"-ni\". Some speakers use the prefix \"-ku-\" (otherwise indicating 2nd person singular) with the suffix \"-(e)ni\", as in \"ninakuoneni\" \"I see you all.\"\n\nThe reflexive prefix only occurs as an object, and refers back to the subject of the sentence. It is equivalent to English forms like \"myself\", \"yourself\", \"himself\" and so on.\n\nThe infinitive is a verbal noun, and belongs to class 15, which is reserved specifically for infinitives. It is marked by the prefix ku-. It may occur in the same contexts as other nouns and may, occasionally, even be derived into the locative classes by means of attaching the suffix \"-ni\", as in \"kuangukani\" \"in falling\" (i.e. \"while falling\"). It corresponds to the English infinitive or gerund. Infinitives cannot take subject, relative or TAM prefixes, but they may take object prefixes.\n\nThe negative infinitive is derived from the verb \"kutoa\" \"to subtract\", \"to not do\", although it is rarely encountered in its full form for this use. The additional \"-ku-\" in brackets is the infinitive marker of the original verb, although it may be omitted as long as stress rules allow.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, the following verb forms may be referred to as \"tenses\" as they often are in learner materials, but it should be remembered that many of these are not grammatical tenses in the technical sense but may instead be aspects or moods. All together, Tense, Aspect and Mood may be abbreviated as TAM.\n\nThe following table shows a summary of TAM forms which will be discussed in further depth below. Brackets indicate optional elements and slashes indicate alternative elements of which either (but not both) may fill the same slot in the verb. The column labelled 'final vowel' is only relevant for \"short\" and \"common verbs\", with \"loan verbs\" remaining invariable here with the exception of the \"-ni\" suffix added to indicate 2nd person plural address. In any TAM form, when the object is 2nd person plural, this \"-(e)ni\" prefix may also occur, but this is not shown in this table.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Note that the 'indefinite' present \"-a-\" causes the form of the subject marker to change as outlined above.\n\nThe imperative mood is used to issue direct commands. It can occur either alone or with an object prefix. The presence of an object prefix (including the reflexive \"ji-\") causes the final \"-a\" of Bantu verbs to become \"-e\". Note that the \"ji-\" prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of \"-jifunza\" \"to learn\" is \"jifunze\" \"learn!\" and not \"*jifunza\".\n\nThe plural form, with the suffix \"-ni\", is used when addressing multiple people.\n\nThe following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite:\nThe verb \"-acha\" may informally be given the imperative form wacha (pl. wacheni).\n\nAdditionally, the verb \"kuwa\" \"to be\" has an irregular imperative form: iwe (pl. iweni), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form kuwa (pl. kuweni) or used in the subjunctive (\"polite imperative\") form: uwe (pl. mwe).\n\nThere is no actual negative imperative form. The equivalent is achieved with the negative subjunctive. The formation of this is outlined below, but for the sake of completeness the negative equivalents of the above examples are given here.\n\nThere are two present tenses in Swahili. These are sometimes termed the \"definite present\" (with -na-) and the \"indefinite present\" (with -a-). In modern, standard Swahili, however, there is no great difference in meaning between these two forms as the \"indefinite present\" is more or less obsolete and rarely used other than its frequent appearance in media headlines. A distinction between these two forms is not made in the negative, with both forms being negated the same way.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Although rarely used, the \"indefinite present\" adds a small complication to the presentation of Swahili grammar as the -a- marking the tense causes the subject concords to undergo reduction in the same manner as the prefixes of the genitive preposition \"-a\". This is outlined above.\n\nIn informal Swahili, it is very common for the first person singular concord \"ni-\" to collapse into the -na- of the definite present tense marker and become inaudible (and unwritten). The distinction between the \"definite\" and \"indefinite\" present tense forms appears to vanish in the first person as both begin with a \"na-\", however short verbs retain their \"-ku-\" extension in the \"-na-\" tense and lose it in the \"-a-\" tense, allowing this distinction to still be felt, such as in \"(ni)nakula\" \"I eat\", in the \"-na-\" present tense, versus \"nala\" \"I eat\", in the \"-a-\" present tense.\n\nThe habitual verb form is unusual in that it does not allow subject prefixes to appear on it. The prefix hu- is added to the beginning of the verb and short verbs do not need their \"-ku-\" extension.\nThe habitual indicates repeated, habitual occurrence of an action (habitual aspect) or something occurring as a timeless general rule (gnomic aspect). Because subject prefixes are absent, personal pronouns are very frequently used to indicate the subject.\n\nThe habitual aspect with \"hu-\" is often replaced by the present with \"-na-\" in everyday use, the \"sisi hunywa\" of the above example then being replaced with \"tunakunywa.\" Some speakers instead use the non-standard habitual suffix -ga or -nga which has entered Swahili from other Bantu languages spoken in East Africa, giving \"tunakunywaga\" or \"tunakunywanga\". The habitual aspect with \"hu-\" is, however, very commonly used in proverbs dealing with eternal truisms.\n\nThe past tense is used in Swahili to talk about actions or states in the past, whether in the near or the distant past. It is formed with the prefix \"-li-\". Its negative equivalent is formed with the negative subject prefix plus \"-ku-\". The positive tense marker \"-li-\" cannot take stress and triggers the use of the extension \"-ku-\" (or \"-kw-\") where necessary. The negative tense marker \"-ku-\" can take stress, meaning that an additional \"-ku-\" extension is not needed.\n\nThe perfect indicates an action or situation which occurred in the past, similarly to the past tense, however the focus of the utterance is on the relevance of this past action to the present moment. For example, the word \"nimepika\" \"I have cooked\" describes a past action with present relevance (i.e. the food is ready now) whereas \"nilipika\" \"I cooked\" describes a past action with no implication of any relevance to the present (the food may have been eaten long ago, or not).\n\nThe perfect is formed in the positive with the prefix -me-. The negative is formed with the negative subject prefix plus -ja-. As with the present and past tenses, the positive present marker -me- cannot take the word stress and triggers the appearance of the \"-ku-\" extension in short verbs, but the negative marker -ja- is able to be stressed. Some speakers may use the extension \"-ku-\" with -ja-.\n\nSome sources describe the -ja- form as containing more of an implication of \"not yet\" than a simple negation of the \"-me\"- form, however the word \"bado\" \"still\", \"not yet\" may be used to indicate this explicitly where necessary.\n\nInchoative verbs, such as \"kuchoka\" \"to get tired\", which describe the entering of a state, are used in the perfect to indicate \"being\" in the state in question. Compare for example: \"ninachoka\" \"I am becoming tired\"; \"nimechoka\" \"I have become tired\", i.e. \"I am tired.\" For more information and examples, see the section on inchoative verbs below.\n\nSome speakers may replace the sequence of prefixes a-me- with ka- with more or less the same meaning. This may derive from the consecutive tense marker.\n\nThe anterior marker -sha- (or sometimes -kwisha-) is a relatively new TAM marker that derives diachronically from the verb kwisha \"to finish, to run out\". It is most commonly (and perhaps least controversially) used directly after the perfect marker -me-. It often imparts the meaning of \"already\", emphasising the completeness of the action.\nThe anterior marker -sha- is also used with other TAM markers, simply sitting after them within the TAM slot. It may also on occasion be used on its own, with a function more or less equivalent to the perfect \"-me-\". These uses may not be regarded as standard Swahili. It is frequently used with the situational marker \"-ki-\" where it indicates a situation in which the action has been completed.\n\nThe future tense is formed in Swahili with the prefix -ta-. The negative form is indicated simply by using the negative subject prefix, with -ta- being used here as well. A number of speakers, however, use -to- in the negative future. This may be derived by analogy from the \"-to-\" of the negative infinitive, and may also disambiguate between positive and negative where the only difference otherwise would be an \"h-\" at the beginning of the negative word. For example, \"atakuja\" \"s/he will come\" vs. \"hatakuja\" \"s/he will not come\" (or \"hatokuja\"). Because second language speakers in many areas have trouble with pronouncing and distinguishing /h/, the optional change from -ta- to -to- in the negative can provide a failsafe indication when a negative meaning is intended.\n\n-Ta- (and likewise -to-) cannot take the word stress whether in positive or negative and thus causes the appearance of the \"-ku-\" extension in short verbs.\n\nThe subjunctive (sometimes referred to as an optative) expresses hypothetical situations, wishes and requests. It is also used as a complement to certain auxiliary verbs and conjunctions. The subjunctive is indicated by the lack of any Tense-Aspect-Mood prefix and the change of the final \"-a\", where present, to \"-e\"-. The so-called \"Arabic verbs\" do not undergo this change and the subjunctive form is made simply by omitting any tense marker. The negative subjunctive is indicated by adding the syllable \"-si-\" into the tense slot, with the positive subject prefix being used rather than the negative.\n\nThe subjunctive is frequently used following the equivalents of modal verbs, verbs indicating wishes, suggestions, recommendations and other constructions.\n\nAn equivalent of \"must\" or \"have to\" is formed with \"ni lazima\" \"it is necessary\", or simply \"lazima\" \"necessarily\" followed by the subjunctive. \nThe subjunctive may be used on its own with a second person subject as a more polite alternative to an imperative. As there is no negative imperative, forms beginning with \"usi-\" and \"msi-\" may also be interpreted as such.\nThe situational, simultaneous or conditional tense is formed with the TAM prefix -ki-. This prefix may take stress and thus the extension \"-ku-\" does not appear with short verbs in the situational verb form.\n\nThere is, strictly speaking, no negative form of the situational, however, in conditional sentences, the relative verb form using -sipo- is quite close in meaning to a negative equivalent of -ki- and it will be given here as it may prove helpful. Note that the \"-ku-\" extension \"does\" appear with \"-sipo-\" as the \"-po-\", like all relative syllables, is unable to be stressed.\n\nThe situational verb form is used to indicate a simultaneous action or situation of subordinate importance that provides the temporal or contextual background for the main verb in the sentence. It is somewhat equivalent to the English conjunctions \"if\" and \"when\", but it also forms the equivalent of adverbial participle clauses. If needed for clarity or emphasis, a word meaning if, such as \"kama\", \"ikiwa\" or \"endapo\" may be added to the beginning of the clause (which allows the speaker to choose a different TAM marker). The word \"ikiwa\" is itself the situational form of the verb \"-wa\" \"to be\", with the class 9 subject prefix \"i-\", literally meaning on its own essentially \"if it is\".\n\nThe situational may appear in compound progressive tenses.\nThe consecutive or narrative tense is formed with the TAM prefix -ka-. This prefix may take stress and thus the extension \"-ku-\" does not appear with short verbs in this form.\nThe consecutive tense is mainly used with the past tense -li- in narrating a sequence of events whereby \"-li-\" is used for the first verb and \"-ka-\" for subsequent verbs. It roughly carries the meaning \"and then\" and makes the use of \"na\" \"and\" or \"halafu\" / \"kisha\" \"then\" essentially redundant. Where context is clearly past, a narrative may also be begun with \"-ka-\".\nThere is, strictly speaking, no negative form of the situational, however the negative subjunctive may occasionally be used for this purpose.\nThe consecutive marker -ka- may combine with the final -e of the subjunctive mood to form the expeditous.\n\nThe expeditous verb form is essentially the same as the subjunctive in meaning except with the added meaning of \"and\" or \"then\" introduced by the consecutive marker -ka-.\n\nThe word \"akawe\" in the above sentence could also be replaced with \"ili awe\" \"in order that he be\" or simply the subjunctive \"awe\" \"that he be\" (or \"(for him) to be\" in more natural contemporary English), but the \"-ka-\" added to this word emphasises his becoming an ambassador immediately following his being dispatched.\n\nThe expeditous verb form is frequently used with imperatives (and \"polite imperatives\" in the subjunctive), again indicating roughly \"and then\".\n\nThe subject prefix may be dropped when used with the imperative.\nThere are two irrealis verb forms, one which may be called \"present irrealis\" (marked by -nge-) and one which may be called \"past irrealis\" (marked by -ngali-). The standard means of forming the negative is to use \"-si-\" in the TAM slot, forming \"-singe-\" and \"-singali\"-. Some speakers, however, particularly in speech influenced by southern dialects, negate the irrealis verb forms instead by using the negative subject concords.\n\nBoth the irrealis forms are used to discuss hypothetical situations, generally within conditional sentences. Both the protasis (if-clause) and apodosis (then-clause) may have an identical structure with the protasis appearing first. In order to disambiguate or emphasise, such as if the clauses are in the reverse order, a word for \"if\" (\"kama\", \"ikiwa\", \"endapo\") may precede the protasis.\n\nIn the usage of many speakers, the distinction between the present and past irrealis forms is somewhat blurred so that the final example above may commonly be spoken as \"\"(Kama) ningejua hiyo, nisingekuja hapa\".\" which, speaking strictly, could be interpreted as \"If I knew that I would not come here.\"\n\nThere are five verb templates which can be used to create relative clauses. The three simple tenses PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE may only be relativised in their positive sense. In addition to these, there is a tenseless positive form and a tenseless negative form. For all other verb forms, relative clauses must be formed by a periphrastic relative using \"amba-\".\n\nThe following table shows the structure of the verb templates, notably the positioning of the relative morpheme, here labelled \"REL\". Note in the following table that the marker for the future tense is \"-taka-\" with a following relative morpheme, rather than the simple \"-ta-\" which occurs otherwise.\nThe relative morpheme takes one of many forms to indicate the class of its referent. The relative morpheme for each class is identical to its combining pronominal form which appears with \"na-\" and \"ndi-\". Aside from class 1, the form of each can be achieved by placing \"o\" (the so-called \"o of reference\")\n\nIn most languages with a verbal copula, the equivalent of the verb 'to be', it is this verb that exhibits the most irregularity and the most diversity of form. Swahili is no exception. Outside of the present tense, the Swahili verb -wa (infinitive kuwa) is almost entirely regular, inflecting as other short verbs do. In the present tense, however, there is a distinction made between a copular of \"essence\" versus a copula of \"state or location\". This is similar to the distinction between \"ser\" and \"estar\" in Spanish and Portuguese, however, in Swahili, this distinction largely vanishes outside of the present tense. There are also irregular relativised forms for the present tense as well as an irregular unique continuative form.\n\nThe invariable copula ni is used, in the present tense, to express that two noun phrases (the subject and complement) refer to one and the same referent:\nIt is also used to express membership of a class (a subset relationship):\nIt may also introduce an adjective or equivalent phrase describing a relatively permanent characteristic.\nThe negative form si can be used in all the same situations with a negative meaning:\nBecause ni and si do not provide any information about the subject, personal pronouns, usually only necessary for emphasis, frequently appear. Compare the typical use of irregular present tense with that of the entirely regular past tense where the subject prefixes make personal pronouns redundant and used only for emphasis.\nA sentence begun with ni or si without an overtly marked pronoun is typically translated with the subject \"it\" in English. With plural context, \"they\" may be meant.\nOn occasion, the invariable copula may follow regular forms of \"kuwa\" in other tenses. In the following example, the \"ni\" could also be left out.\n\nThe emphatic or focusing copula ndi- places its subject in focus, emphasising that it is \"that particular referent\" and not another. The emphatic copula takes suffixes matching the person and noun class of the referent. These suffixes are the same as those which combine with \"na\". In the first and second persons, the third person suffixes are frequently used.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The form \"sisi\" \"it is not us\" is not frequently used as it is identical to the pronoun \"sisi\" \"we\", \"us\". Instead it is virtually always replaced with \"sio\".\n\nForms of the emphatic copula are frequently equivalent to a definite phrase in translation and are followed by relative verb forms as in the following example:\nCompare the above with the non-emphatic version of the same sentence:\nLocation is indicated in the present tense by prefixing the subject concord to one of the locative clitics \"-po\", \"-ko\" and \"-mo\". The class 1 subject concord \"a-\" (negative: \"ha-\") is however replaced with \"yu-\" (negative: \"hayu-\").\n\nThe three clitics, \"-po\", \"-ko\" and \"-mo\" correspond to the locative classes 16, 17 and 18 respectively and indicate \"definite\", \"indefinite\" and \"internal\" location respectively. For example, \"wapo\" means essentially \"they are here/there\", \"wako\" means \"they are around here/there\" and \"wamo\" means \"they are in here/there\".\nUnder a very strict prescriptive viewpoint, the classes should not be mixed, for instance \"nipo hapa\" \"I am here\" is regarded as correct but \"niko hapa\" \"I am here\" is regarded as incorrect. There is, however, a broad tendency for many speakers to prefer forms with \"-ko\" over the other forms, such that \"niko hapa\" is very common.\n\nA large number of Swahili verbs indicate the process of entering a state. For example, the verbs \"kulewa\" (\"to get drunk\"), \"kuchoka\" (\"to become tired\") and \"kuchelewa\" (\"to become late\") describe the respective changes to state from \"not drunk\" to \"drunk\", from \"not tired\" to \"tired\" and from \"not late\" to \"late\". These may be regarded as inherently inchoative verbs. There is, however, no equivalent \"stative verb\" for each one that would describe being in the state of having completed that process, i.e. \"to be [state]\". Stative meanings such as \"be drunk\", \"be tired\" and \"be late\" are formed by using these inchoative verbs with the perfect marker -me- (or, in the negative, -ja-). Many words which are present in English as adjectives have no corresponding adjective in Swahili and are expressed by means of inchoative verbs.\nWhen using inchoative verbs, compound tenses must be used to talk about states occurring at times other than the present.\n\nNew verbs are readily created from simple verbs by attaching various suffixes (often called \"extensions\") to the stem to get different shades of meaning by altering grammatical voice. Note that the final \"-a\" of common and short verbs only appears at the very end of the verb and is dropped before any suffixes.\n\nThe reciprocal suffix -ana adds the meaning \"each other\" to the verb.\nThe subject of a reciprocal verb is generally plural, however a singular subject may be used, often followed by \"na\" and an additional referent.\n\nThe applicative suffix, frequently called the 'prepositional extension' in learning resources, adds one of various meanings to a verb usually represented by a preposition in English such as \"to\", \"for\", \"in\", \"with\" or even \"from\". The form of the applicative suffix varies, depending on vowel harmony and the reappearance of the /l/ which disappeared from an older stage of Swahili between the final two vowels. \n\nLoan verbs usually form their applicative forms by removing their final vowel and replacing it with either \"-ia\" or \"-ea\" according to the same rules.\n\nThe causative suffix is added to verbs to indicate a person or thing causing another person or thing to perform the action of the original verb. There are a few ways in which causatives are formed. The most common and productive causative suffix is \"-isha\", which follows the same rules of vowel harmony as the applicative suffix.\n\nShort verbs have no preceding vowel so have to be learnt individually.\n\n\nLoan verbs, except those ending in \"-au\", remove their final vowel before adding these suffixes.\n\n\nThese suffixes may also be added to verbs and nouns to create causative verbs from them.\n\n\nThere is a less common causative suffix \"-iza\" or \"-eza\" which appears with some words. Often there is more than derivation from the same word, sometimes with different meanings.\n\nThere is another means of deriving causative verbs and which results from an earlier \"-y-\" in the language. This \"-y-\" suffix combined with consonants and changed their pronunciation, palatalising or \"softening\" them. The following table outlines the common sound changes.\n\nIn many cases, more than one of these suffixes may be used to derive different verbs from a single verb, formed by various means. In some cases, such as with \"-onyesha\" \"to show\", two causative suffixes may appear together.\n\nVerbs that end with \"-ka\" very frequently exchange this to \"-sha\" to form the causative, however this is much less common when the preceding syllable contains \"e\" or \"i\".\n\n\nBecause most of the word-final sequences of more than one vowel come from the deletion of an \"l\" that was present in an earlier stage of the language (and often preserved in many dialects and related languages), many verbs which today end in a sequence of two vowels are made by (removing the final \"-a\") and adding -za. This \"-z-\" results from the palatalisation (\"softening\") process outlined above. which was applied to the \"-l-\" in these verbs. The \"-l-\" was subsequently lost but the \"-z-\" was not.\n\n\nThe passive suffix is generally -wa. \nVerb stems that end with \"l\" or either of the semivowels \"w\" or \"y\" (but not \"ny\" as that is a single consonant written with two letters, as illustrated by \"-danganywa\" above) take a suffix -iwa; if the preceding syllable contains \"e\" or \"o\", it will be -ewa instead.\nVerbs whose ending in one of the front vowels plus \"a\", (i.e. the sequences \"-ea\" and -\"ia\") usually simply add \"-wa.\" \nA few words of this group, however, add \"-lewa\" (after an \"e\") or \"-liwa\" (after \"i\"), resulting from the earlier .\nAs Swahili does not distinguish between the sequences /ua/ and /uwa/ or /oa/ and /owa/, the passive ending \"-wa\" would be inaudible on verbs, so the \"-liwa\" and \"-lewa\" endings are used instead. \nNote that the verb \"-ua\" \"to kill\" has an irregular passive form: \"-uawa, although the regular \"-uliwa is occasionally used.\n\nThe Kiunguja dialect, specifically the variant of it spoken in Zanzibar City, which has been made the standard dialect, goes a step further than many other dialects, requiring also that all verbs ending in \"-aa\" be passivised with the suffix \"-liwa\" even though the difference between /ɑɑ/ and /ɑwɑ/ is perfectly distinct.\nThe short verbs have passive forms that must be learnt separately. In each case, the passive form is one syllable longer and falls into the category of common verbs and thus does not receive the extension \"-ku-\" anywhere in its conjugation.\nMost loan-verbs simply add \"-wa\".\nIf a loan-verb ends with a consonant followed by -u, this \"u\" becomes an \"i\" \nLoan-verbs which end in \"-au\" add \"-liwa\"\nVerbs ending in \"-uu\" lose one \"u\" and replace it with \"-liwa\".\n\nThe agent in a sentence with a passive verb does not need to be included in the sentence. The passive verb, however, does explicitly allude to the existence of an agent, in contrast to the mediopassive below. When the agent is included in the sentence, it is introduced by the preposition \"na\", which is here the equivalent of the English \"by\", although in other contexts it is more usually equivalent to \"and\" or \"with\".\n\nThe mediopassive suffix is added to a transitive verb in order to promote its object to the role of subject without the implication of an agent. The form of the suffix involves ends in \"-ka\" and generally the harmonic \"i\" or \"e\" before it, although this may be dropped in verbs with a vowel final root; alternatively, the lost \"l\" of final vowel combinations may reappear and act as a buffer for the harmonic \"i\" or \"e\". \n\nAs with the other derivational suffixes (or \"extensions\"), loan verbs generally lose their final vowel before adding -ika or -eka according to vowel harmony rules, The exceptions are those ending in -au which use \"-lika'.\n\n\nIn learner materials, the mediopassive suffix generally erroneously described as the \"stative extension\" despite the fact that the resulting verbs do not generally fulfil the requirements stative: namely that they describe unchanging states. For example, the mediopassive verb \"-vunjika \"to break; go to pieces\" contrasts with its source verb \"-vunja\" \"to break; make go to pieces\", not in the quality of being either stative or dynamic — both are dynamic, describing a process that changes over time — but in that the subject of \"-vunjika\" is equivalent to the object of \"-vunja\", and the subject of \"-vunja\" is completely absent from a clause with \"-vunjika. In this respect, mediopassive verbs are the same as passive verbs, however they are distinguished by their incompatibility with any mention of an agent. Compare the following three examples.\n\nMediopassive verbs often have the appearance of being stative when used in the perfect. However, this is a function of the perfect, which focuses on the present relevance of a past action, rather than a function of the mediopassive itself. For example, the sentence \"Dirisha limevunjika,\" means either \"The window has broken,\" or \"The window is broken.\" What is being said is that the window broke in the past, but that the effects of this action are still relevant in the present. The verb itself, \"-vunjika\", does not describe the state of being broken, but rather the dynamic process of changing from \"whole; in tact\" to \"broken; in pieces\". The perfect \"-me-\" here indicates that we are concerned with the state after the dynamic process.\n\nSuffixes can be stacked upon each other to make quite long verb stems with specific meanings. The passive suffix must always be last in Swahili.\n\n\nHere is another rather more implausible example:\n\nThe genitive preposition \"-a\" (sometimes termed a \"connector\", \"possessive\" or \"associative\" preposition) has a similar role to that of the genitive case of some other languages. It indicates the possessor, or a more general association, and roughly corresponds in meaning to the English preposition \"of\". It receives a prefix that agrees with the preceding noun's class. For example:\n\n\nThe equivalent of English compound nouns are often formed with genitive constructions, such as \"taa ya barabarani\" \"traffic light\", \"street light\", which is literally equivalent to \"light of road-LOC\".\n\nThe personal pronouns each have their own genitive stem, for example:\n\n\nThe genitive preposition is formed from the subject concord of verbs (which you can see here), plus \"-a\". There are some sound changes that happen. \"U-\" and \"i-\" become their equivalent semivowels \"w-\" and \"y-\" respectively. After consonants, this y is generally dropped although \"ki-\" and \"vi-\" become \"ch-\" and \"vy-\". The class 1 verbal concord \"a-\" is an exception, being replaced with \"w-\" in the genitive construction.\n\nThe word \"kwa\" is a very frequently encountered preposition in Swahili. It may be regarded as either the class 15 or class 17 variant of \"-a\". Where there is no 15 or class 17 antecedent, its function is adverbial, relating to the action expressed by the sentence rather than to a particular noun within it. It may be equivalent to a wide variety of prepositions in English, but it possibly frequently equivalent to an instrumental use of \"by (means of)\", \"using\" or \"with\". In standard Swahili, it may indicate a location associated with an animate referent, but is replaced by \"kwenye\" for inanimate referents.\n\n\nThe ornative preposition \"-enye\" essentially means \"having\" or \"with\" and takes the same prefixes as the genitive -a with the exception of class 1, where it receives the prefix \"mw-\" instead of \"w-\". The word \"-enye\" is followed by a noun. \n\n"}

In English-speaking countries, the Botanical Latin places syllable stress for botanical names derived from ancient Greek and Latin broadly according to two systems, either the Reformed academic pronunciation, or the pronunciation developed initially in some large part by British gardeners, horticulturists, naturalists, and botanists of the 19th century. The two systems of pronunciation are sometimes referred to as the \"classical method\" and the \"ecclesiastical method\". The two systems differ significantly in pronunciation, but little in syllable stress.\n\nWhat follow are the rules of stress of reformed academic pronunciation of Latin (intended to approximate the stress rules of ancient spoken Latin). Words of Greek origin are generally pronounced according to the same rules; native ancient Greek rules of stress are not used.\n\nGenerally in Latin each vowel or diphthong belongs to a single syllable. Classical Latin diphthongs are ae, au, and oe. Diphthongs from Greek can include oi, eu, ei, and ou, and ui also occasionally occurs in botanical Latin. Syllables end in vowels, unless there are multiple consonants, in which case the consonants are divided between the two syllables, with certain consonants being treated as pairs. In words of two syllables, the stress is on the first syllable. Words that contain three or more syllables have stresses accorded to their syllables by the quality and location of the different vowels in the words. In words of more than two syllables, the stress is on the penultimate syllable when the syllable contains a long vowel or diphthong, otherwise the stress is on the antepenultimate syllable.\n\nWhether a vowel is long or short in a classical Latin word is a function of the vowel and its relationship to the consonants that precede or follow it. Modern Latin dictionaries and textbooks may contain diacritics called macrons for long vowels or breves for short vowels. Botanical Latin does not traditionally include macrons or breves, and they are prohibited (as diacritics) by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Article 60.6). Some books follow the mediaeval tradition to add an acute accent to mark the stressed syllable.\n\nTo determine the position of the stress of Latin terms:\n\n"}

It is a musical term to indicate that an instrument or voice does not sound, also known as a rest. In vocal polyphony and in orchestral scores, it usually indicates a long period of time, typically an entire movement. In more modern music such as jazz, tacet tends to mark considerably shorter breaks. Multirests, or multiple-measure rests, are rests which last multiple measures (or multiple rests, each of which lasts an entire measure).\n\nIt was common for early symphonies to leave out the brass or percussion in certain movements, especially in slow (second) movements, and this is the instruction given in the parts for the player to wait until the end of the movement.\n\nIt is also commonly used in accompaniment music to indicate that the instrument does not play on a certain run through a portion of the music, i.e., \"Tacet 1st time.\" The phrase \"tacet al fine\" is used to indicate that the performer should remain silent for the remainder of the piece (or portion thereof), and need not, for example, count rests.\n\nTacet may be appropriate when a particular instrument/voice/section, \"is to rest for an entire section, movement, or composition.\" \"Partial rests, of course, in every case must be written in. Even though it means 'silent,' the term \"tacet\"...is not a wise substitution for a lengthy rest within a movement...The term \"tacet\", therefore, should be used \"only\" to indicate that a player rests throughout an \"entire movement\".

It was founded by the archaeologist James Burgess to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India and was notable for the high quality of its epigraphic illustrations which enabled scholars to make accurate translations of texts that in many cases remain the definitive versions to this day. It was also pioneering in its recording of Indian folklore. It was succeeded by \"The New Indian Antiquary\" (1938-47) and the \"Indian Antiquary\" (1964-71).\n\n\"The Indian Antiquary\" was founded in 1872 by the archaeologist James Burgess CIE as a journal of original research relating to India. It was designed to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India. \n\nThe journal was a private venture, although no contributor or editor was ever paid for their work and the editors often had to support the publication out of their own pockets. Burgess was the first editor and he continued in that role until the end of 1884 when failing eyesight forced him to hand over to John Faithfull Fleet and Richard Carnac Temple.\n\nThe late nineteenth century was marked by a great increase in the number of local historical societies in India and a similar increase in the number of Indians who could speak and write English, to the extent that by the 1920s the entire journal could have been filled with work by Indian contributors. Volumes for 1925 to 1932 were published under the authority of the Council of the Royal Anthropological Institute (1933, not). The first incarnation of the \"Antiquary\" ceased publication in 1933 with volume 62, number 783 (Dec. 1933), two years after Richard Temple's death in 1931. Several early volumes of the journal were reprinted by Swati Publications in Delhi, 1984.\n\nThe New Indian Antiquary was published between 1938 and 1947, and the Indian Antiquary (described as the \"third series\") between 1964 and 1971. (Volumes 14 to 62 of the original \"Antiquary\" were described as the \"second series\".)\n\nThe journal had an archaeological and historical focus, and in the late nineteenth century that naturally meant that epigraphy (the study of inscriptions as writing rather than as literature) would be one of the principal subjects covered in its pages. Indeed, the \"Antiquary\" was the premier source of European scholarship on Indian epigraphy until the twentieth century and the official Indian government journal of epigraphy, the \"Epigraphia Indica\", was published as a quarterly supplement to the \"Antiquary\" between 1892 and 1920.\n\nThe \"Antiquary\" was printed at Mazgaon, Bombay, by the Bombay Education Society and later the British India Press, but illustrations were produced in London by the firm of Griggs who were known for the accuracy of their work. A high standard of reproduction was essential so that scholars could work on the epigraphic material without needing to see the originals. Illustrations in the \"Antiquary\" were used by scholars such as Bhandarkar, Bhagvanlal Indraji, Georg Bühler, John Faithfull Fleet, Eggeling and B. Lewis Rice to decipher important inscriptions, and in many cases their translations remain the definitive versions to this day.\n\nOver one thousand plates were included in \"The Indian Antiquary\" and the \"Epigraphia Indica\" over the first fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was not without its disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London three times before they reached Bombay safely.\n\nAnother area where the \"Antiquary\" led was in recording folklore and folktales. Its publication of Punjab folktales was the first attempt to classify the events on which folk tales were based and the pioneering work on north Indian folklore of William Crooke and Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube was printed in its pages.\n\n"}
