{"id": "38404400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38404400", "title": "Akram Aylisli", "text": "Akram Aylisli\n\nAkram Najaf oglu Naibov (, born December 6, 1937), better known by his pen name Akram Aylisli, is an Azerbaijani writer, playwright, novelist and former member of parliament. His works have been translated from his native Azerbaijani into a number of languages in the former Soviet Union and around the world. He was decorated by the President of Azerbaijan with the prestigious \"Istiglal\" (2002) and \"Shokhrat\" orders.\nIn 2013, after the publication of Aylisli's \"Stone Dreams\" novella, which depicted the pogroms carried out by Azerbaijanis against the Armenians in Sumgait and Baku and presented Armenians in sympathetic light, President Aliyev signed a presidential decree that stripped Aylisli of the title of \"People's Writer\" and the presidential pension. His books were burnt by Azerbaijani intelligentsia and compatriots in his hometown, his son and wife were fired from their jobs and a \"bounty\" of some $13,000 was promised for cutting the writer's ear off. In March 2014, a formal request was made by various public figures throughout the world to nominate Aylisli for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAylisli was born in the village of Aylis in 1937 in the Ordubad region of the Nakhchivan, part of Soviet Azerbaijan, near the borders of Armenia and Iran. His mother, Leya Ali Kyzy, was the village storyteller, his father died at WWII when Akram was five. His youth in the Soviet Union coincided with one of its more liberal periods: the years of de-Stalinization and the ‘Thaw’ under the flamboyant leadership of Nikita Khrushchev. Aylisli received his graduate education at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow, the elite school of creative writing for Soviet writers.\n\nHis first work, a poem entitled \"Qeşem ve onun Kürekeni\", was published in the journal \"Azerbaycan\". During Soviet times Aylisli was a poet, translator, and playwright, and he authored a number of novels: \"Trees without Shade\", \"Shining of the six suns\", \"The season of colorful dresses\", \"The white canyon\", \"The dam\", \"Peoples and Trees\" and others. Most of Aylisli’s works are associated with this native village. Aylisli’s stories and novels, so subtle and full of affection for peasant life, are very popular in Azerbaijan and Soviet Union. His novel \"Peoples and Trees\" have been translated into more than thirty languages and published beyond Soviet borders in the countries of Eastern Europe. Сonceptually and personally Aylisli was close to the Russian \"Village Prose\" movement.\n\nAylisli was also the author of a number of dramas and plays, including \"Quşu Uçan Budaqlar\", \"Menim Neğmekar Bibim\", \"Bağdada Putyovka Var\", and \"Vezife\", which were staged and shown in theaters in Baku, Nakhchivan, Ganja, and Yerevan. Moreover, Aylisli worked as a translator. He translated into Azeri the books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Heinrich Böll, Ivan Turgenev, Konstantin Paustovsky, Vladimir Korolenko, Anton Chekhov, Vasily Shukshin, Chinghiz Aitmatov, Salman Rushdie.\n\nFrom 1968–70, he became the editor-in-chief of \"Gençlik\", and later worked as a satirist for the journal \"Mozalan\". From 1974–78, he served on the Azerbaijan SSR's State Committee for Cinematography.\n\nAylisli was awarded the title of “People’s Writer” as well as the highest state awards of Azerbaijan – the medals of “Shokhrat” (“Honor”) and “Istiglal” (“Independence”). In November 2005, he was elected to the National Assembly of Azerbaijan (Milli Majlis) as a member of parliament representing his constituency in Julfa-Ordubad. He served for one term, which ended on November 7, 2010.\n\nAylisli generally is supportive of left wing views. His works published in the Soviet Union did not conform to socialist realism, than some other writers of the Azerbaijan SSR at that time, and he spoke negatively about the Soviet era for a while in 1990s. In one of his recent interviews broadcast on television channel ANS TV he stated that he believes that Karl Marx was a genius, and the world will come to his ideas sooner or later.\n\nIn late 2012 and early 2013, Aylisli found himself embroiled in controversy when his novella, \"Daş yuxular\" (\"Stone Dreams\"), was published in a Russian-language journal called \"Druzhba Narodov\" (Friendship of the Peoples). It covers the pogroms of Armenians in Baku in 1989 and the massacre of Armenians in his native village by Turkish troops in 1919. The scenes of the recent past and the tales of old people about the Armenian massacre intertwined in the novel. The book was written in 2006 but the author did not dare to publish it. The decision to do so only came following the extradition of Ramil Safarov to Azerbaijan. Safarov – an Azerbaijani army lieutenant – had hacked to death an Armenian army officer in Hungary, and was subsequently welcomed home as a hero of the nation.\n\nThe novel tells the story of the Azerbaijani actor Saday Sadykhly and his efforts to protect his Armenian neighbors during the Sumgait and Baku Pogroms in the closing years of the Soviet Union. The novel begins as the severely beaten Sadykhly is being transported to the hospital: while trying to protect his Armenian neighbor he was also assaulted by the yeraz [Azeri refugees from Armenia] on the streets of Baku, who mistook him too for an Armenian. Basically there are four main characters in the novel. Sadai Sadykhly, his friend Nunavrish Karabahly, also an actor, Sadykhly's father in law Professor of psychiatry, Dr. Abbasaliev and a surgeon in the hospital where Sadykhly was taken right after assault Dr. Farid Farzaneh. Although it looks like that Sadykhly was recovering at the beginning, by the end his body couldn't sustain the physical injuries or the nervous pressure, and so he died.\n\nMany in Azerbaijan took offense to Aylisli's sympathetic portrayal of Armenians, with whom they fought and lost a six-year-long conflict over control of the region of Nagorno-Karabakh in the early 1990s. The novella stirred resentment by depicting only the Azerbaijani brutality against Armenians during the conflict, while never mentioning incidents of alleged Armenian violence against Azerbaijanis such as the Khojaly massacre.\n\nThere are some other controversial aspects to the novel. Shortly after the pogroms in Sumgait at the beginning of March 1988 Sadyghly wants “to go to Echmiadzin in order to convert to Christianity with the blessing of the Armenian Catholicos, stay [there] forever as a monk begging God to forgive Muslims for all the evils which they committed against Armenians”. This element to the novel is likely to be deeply frustrating for many Azerbaijani readers, considering the ambiguous role played by the Armenian Catholicos in the events of the late 1980s. Vazgen I did not act to protect the Azerbaijani population of Armenia or to prevent their expulsion, becoming an unpopular figure in Azerbaijan and his name a derogatory one. Another sensitive taboo seemingly questioned by Aylisli is the significance of circumcision—a ritual sacred to every practicing Muslim. Dr. Farzani, who is married to a Russian woman, wants to have their son circumcised. But his wife asks Farzani whether the Prophet is wiser than God. Ultimately, their son comes to see circumcision as an act of violence on his body, and this reaction eventually breaks Farzani’s family apart. Such a controversial portrayal of a concept as sacred as circumcision is likely to prove very irritating for some Azerbaijani readers.\n\nSoon after \"Stone Dreams\" was published, the honored writer became an enemy of the state. Mass media launched a wide-scale bullying campaign.\n\nIn Baku, Ganja, and in the writer’s native village, rallies were organized where people cried out slogans such as “Death to Akram Aylisli!”, “Traitor!”, \"Why have you sold yourself out to the Armenians?\" ,“Akram is Armenian!”, and they set his books and portraits on fire. Youth Organization of Refugees from Nagorno Karabakh announced their and other NGOs dealing with the affairs of veterans, refugees and IDPs' intention to take legal action against Aylisli.\n\nOn February 7, 2013, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed a presidential decree that stripped Aylisli of his title \"People's Writer\" and the personal pension that went with it.\n\nAli Hasanov, Head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration's Social and Political Department, denounced him for purportedly having no national spirit or sense of humanity, for disrespecting the memory of those who died during the war, and for posing as a defender of human values. He added that Aylisli represents Armenian youth who killed thousands of Azerbaijanis, and took control over Azerbaijani lands and committed the massacre in Khojaly, but that he represents Azerbaijanis as murderers and weak personalities. He further added that as Azerbaijanis they \"must express public hatred towards these people.\"\n\nParliamentarians of the National Assembly during the special session required to deprive Aylisli of all state awards, and his Azerbaijani citizenship and insisted that he move to Armenia. Parliamentarians commented that the novella \"insulted not only Azerbaijanis, but the whole Turkish nation,\" on account of references to the Ottoman Empire's historical persecution of Armenians. They suggested that Aylisli have DNA tested to determine if he was genetically ethnic Armenian. The Chairmen of the National Assembly Ogtay Asadov stated \"There is something suspicious in the blood of everybody who supports Aylisli\".\n\nThe Ministry of Education withdrew his works from the school curriculum. Aylisli's plays were banned from theaters. A lot of Azerbaijani writers, artists and academics repudiated him. Union of Azerbaijani Writers convened a meeting and expelled Aylisli from its membership.\n\nAylisili's wife and son were fired from their jobs.\n\nThe chairman of Caucasian Muslim Board, Sheikh Allahshukur Pashazadeh, branded him an apostate.\n\nHafiz Haciyev, leader of the pro-government political party Muasir Musavat (Modern Equality), said his party would pay $13,000 to anyone who would cut Aylisli's ear off. After coming under strong pressure from foreign embassies and U.S. Department of State on the Azerbaijani government, the Ministry of Interior forced Muasir Musavat to rescind the reward.\n\nResponding to the critics accusing him of being partial, the writer has said: “If I had any doubt that I had disgraced my people that would break me. But they think that when I say two good words about some Armenian I must say three good ones about an Azerbaijani. But it’s not my business to keep that foolish balance! In my story I depict a character and his perception of reality. His mind is very fragile; he’s on the brink of insanity.” \nAylisli defended himself in an interview, commenting that \"Armenians are not enemies for me...How can they be? I am a writer living in the 21st century. A solution to Nagorno-Karabakh is being delayed, and hostility is growing between the two nations. I want to contribute to a peaceful solution.\" \nIn answer to accusation of betrayal Aylisli claimed that he is not a patriot: Where have you seen a writer as a patriot? He must write, everything his mind and reason tell him to \".\n\nOn February 3 the group of young independent intellectuals organized the small demonstration near the monument of Mirza Alakbar Sabir to support Akram Aylisli. The number of Azerbaijani writers and intellectuals, including famous writer and screenwriter Rustam Ibragimbekov, also spoke out in defence of Aylisli.\nLeyla Yunus, the leading Azerbaijani human right activist, claimed that \"Only Aylisli defends the honor and the dignity of our nation after the story of Ramil Safarov\". Ragıp Zarakolu, the leading Turkish human right activist and publisher who is well known for long faced legal harassment for publishing books about the Armenian Genocide, also supported Aylisli.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, Helsinki Citizens’ Assembly and Institute for the Protection of Media Rights struсk a blow for Aylisli. Human Rights Watch (HRW) voiced its concern for Aylisli's physical safety and called for Azerbaijan's \"government to end [the] hostile campaign of intimidation.\" \"The government of Azerbaijan is making a mockery of its international obligations on freedom of expression,\" remarked HRW's Europe and Central Asia director Hugh Williamson.\n\nThe chairman of Armenia's Union of Writers, Levon Ananyan, offered a formal response to the controversy on February 8, saying, \"Kudos to our Azerbaijani colleague! He is that brave man who blazes the trail, the trail that leads to repentance through truth.\" Ananyan added that \"Not only Armenians, but also Russians, all people that are concerned about the future of the country...should share this braveness.\"\n\nThe Russian PEN center and a number of Russian famous writers as Boris Akunin, Andrei Bitov, Viktor Erofeev, Sergey Kaledin, Lev Anninsky also declared their support to Ayilisli.\n\nIn February 2014 a formal request was made by various public figures throughout the world to nominate Aylisli for the Nobel Peace Prize - \"For courage shown in his efforts to reconcile Azerbaijani and Armenian people\". Among the nominators were the social science professors and the university presidents as Craig Calhoun, Immanuel Wallerstein, Theodor Shanin. They noted that Akram Aylisli was probably the first Turkic author who wrote a book of penitence for the Armenian Genocide. \"Aylisli was the first to express that pain in a literary work which is very personal, deep and hard-won. <...> Mr Aylisli’s actions are important not only for Armenians and Azerbaijanis, but for others all across the former Soviet Union, who have been blinded by ethnic hatred. His example in fact transcends location, ethnicity or political persuasion. His lone resistance, his defiance, his willingness to sacrifice all for the sake of truth, is an encouragement to each of us to be brave. <...> Mr Aylisli is one of those rare people such as Martin Luther King and Andrey Sakharov, whose personal courage and moral impulse can change a nation’s fate and destroy the walls dividing nations.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12469704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12469704", "title": "Aroj Ali Matubbar", "text": "Aroj Ali Matubbar\n\nAroj Ali Matubbar (; 17 December 190015 March 1985) was a self-taught philosopher and rationalist from Bangladesh. \n\nHe was born in the village of Charbaria Lamchari, about from Barisal town in British India, currently in Bangladesh. His original name was Aroj Ali, and he only acquired the name 'Matubbar' (meaning 'local landlord') later. He was born to a poor farming family. He studied for only a few months at the village maqtab, however this brief dabble in institutional education centered only on the Quran and other Islam studies. He gathered most of his knowledge on varied subjects, including science and philosophy, through his own readings and research.\n\nMatubbar lost his father at an early age. When he was 12 years old, his inherited property of of land was auctioned off because, as a minor, he was unable to pay land tax. The landless boy faced an even more critical crisis when a local usurer called him out of his ancestral homestead. Destitute, Matubbar grew up somehow on the charity of others and by working as a farm laborer. Due to his poverty, he could not attend school and had to rely on the free maqtab religious education provided by a local mosque. However he did not accept the rigid methods of learning there, and left it. A kindhearted man helped him finish the Bengali Primers. Persevering as he was, he kept on reading more and more. To satisfy his thirst for knowledge he studied all the Bengali books in Barisal Public Library like a serious student. Philosophy as a subject interested him most, but there were not enough books in the collection there. A teacher of philosophy at the B M College, Kazi Ghulam Quadir, was impressed by his depth of knowledge and understanding, so he helped him borrow books from the college library. This was how his mind was shaped.\n\nMatubbar developed a very progressive approach and wrote against ignorance, superstition, and religious fundamentalism. He came to be considered an iconoclast for writing against established religious ideologies. For example, he questioned Islamic law of inheritance, as he failed to reconcile the suggested mode of sharing of inherited property.\n\nAroj Ali wrote several books, in spite of his lack of formal schooling. His writings reflect his controversial philosophy about life and the world. He also befriended a number of communist politicians and academics of Barisal town, including Professor Kazi Golam Kadir and Professor Muhammad Shamsul Haque. His books were always in danger of being banned by the government, since they contained certain claims that disagreed with the religious beliefs of the majority. Matubbar was arrested and taken into police custody for his book, \"Sotyer Shondhaney\" (The Quest for Truth). He was, in fact, subjected to harassment and threats throughout his life, due to his writings, as many of them challenged religious statements and claims.\n\nDue to financial constraints, Matubbar could not pursue any academic course or attain a formal institutional degree. He lived mostly on subsistence farming. He learned surveying techniques and began his life as a private land surveyor in his locality. This enabled him to accumulate some capital and he could own some land to start farming.\n\nHe died on 15 March 1985 (1st Chaitra of the Bengali year 1392 ) in Barisal, Bangladesh. He donated his eyes for transplantation after his death. He donated his body which was received by the Anatomy Department of Sher-e-Bangla Medical College and used for dissection by the medical students. After his death in 1985, Aroj Ali Matubbar came to be regarded as one of the most prolific thinkers that rural Bangladesh ever produced, and an iconoclast who was not afraid of speaking out against entrenched beliefs and superstitions.\n\nMatubbar had to take a lot of trouble in order to publish his books. He himself drew the cover of his first book, which was written in 1952 and published twenty one years later in 1973, under the title \"Satyer Sandhane\". This book gained him a reputation in the locality as a \"learned man\". In the preface he wrote:\n\n“I was thinking of many things, my mind was full of questions, but haphazardly. I then started jotting down questions, not for writing a book, but only to remember these questions later. Those questions were driving my mind towards an endless ocean and I was gradually drifting away from the fold of religion.”\n\nHe made six propositions in this book, which reflected the nature of his philosophical questions. These are:\n\nProposition 1 : dealt with the soul, containing 8 questions<br>\nProposition 2 : dealt with God, containing as many as 11 questions<br>\nProposition 3 : dealt with the after-world, containing as many as 7 questions<br>\nProposition 4 : dealt with religious matters, containing as many as 22 questions<br>\nProposition 5 : dealt with Nature, containing as many as 10 questions<br>\nProposition 6 : dealt with remaining matters, containing as many as 9 questions\n\nThe eight questions he posed in the first proposition exemplify his approach. These are (a) Who am I (self)?, (b) Is Life incorporeal or corporal ? (c) Is mind and his/soul one, and the same? (d) What is the relationship of life with the body and the mind? (e) Can we recognize or identify life? (f) Am I free? (g) Will the soul without body continue to have \"knowledge\" even after it leaves the body at death? and finally (h) How does life can come into and go out of the body?\n\nHe was an unusual type of writer. Because of his rural background, it was not possible on his part to remove the darkness covering his society, but with the dim torch he held, he tried to see the truth, wherever he could, without fear or doubt. In Bangladesh, his writings were censored. Following are his writings:\n\nSeveral of his unpublished manuscripts were later published posthumously under the title of \"Aroj Ali Matubbar Rachanabali\". Some of his writings have been translated into English and compiled in a volume published by Pathak Samabesh.\n\nMatubbar was little known to the elite educated society of the country during his lifetime. His first book, published in 1973, was rich with secular thought but caught little attention. It is only in the final years of life that he came to be known to the enlightened society of the country. His writings were collected and published. People in general started to take an interest in his books, which, although reflecting an untrained mind, posed a number of intriguing questions. He soon rose to eminence, albeit after his death in 1985.\n"}
{"id": "170638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170638", "title": "Arrest", "text": "Arrest\n\nAn arrest is the act of apprehending a person and taking them into custody, usually because they have been suspected of committing or planning a crime. After the person is taken into custody, they can be questioned further and/or charged. An arrest is a procedure in a criminal justice system.\n\nPolice and various other officers have powers of arrest. In some places, a citizen's arrest is permitted; for example in England and Wales, any person can arrest \"anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be committing, have committed or be guilty of committing an indictable offence,\" although certain conditions must be met before taking such action.. Similar powers exist in France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland if a person is caught in an act of crime and not willing or able to produce valid ID.\n\nAs a safeguard against the abuse of power, many countries require that an arrest must be made for a thoroughly justified reason, such as the requirement of probable cause in the United States. Furthermore, the time that a person can be detained in custody is relatively short (in most cases 24 hours in the United Kingdom and France and 24 or 48 hours in the United States) before the detained person must be either charged or released.\n\nThe word \"arrest\" is Anglo-Norman in origin, derived from the French word \"arrêt\" meaning 'to stop or stay' and signifies a restraint of a person. Lexicologically, the meaning of the word arrest is given in various dictionaries depending upon the circumstances in which the word is used. There are numerous slang terms for being arrested throughout the world. In British slang terminology, the term \"nicked\" is often synonymous with being arrested, and \"nick\" can also refer to a police station, and the term \"pinched\" is also common. In the United States and France the term \"collared\" is sometimes used. The terms \"lifted\" or \"picked up\" are also heard on occasion.\n\nAccording to Indian law, no formality is needed during the procedure of arrest. The arrest can be made by a citizen, a police officer or a Magistrate. The police officer needs to inform the person being arrested the full particulars of the person's offence and that they are entitled to be released on bail if the offence fits the criteria for being bailable. There is no general rule of eligibility or requirement that a police officer must handcuff a person who is being arrested. When there is a question regarding handcuffing a person then at that time case laws has stated that the choice to handcuff a person is dependent on the surrounding circumstances, and that officers should always take the proper precautions to ensure the safety of themselves, and the public.\n\nWhen there exists probable cause to believe that a person has committed a minor crime, such as petty theft, driving on a suspended license, or disturbing the peace, law enforcement agents typically issue the individual a citation but do not otherwise detain them. The person must then appear in court on the date provided on the citation. Prior to the court date, the prosecution will decide whether to file formal criminal charges against the individual. When the accused appears in court, they will be advised if formal criminal charges have been filed. If charges are filed, they will be asked to plead guilty or not guilty at the initial court hearing, which is referred to as the arraignment.\n\nWhen a person is arrested for a serious crime, the defendant will have their picture taken and be held in pre-trial prison. Under certain circumstances (that is where the public won't be endangered by one's release from custody), the defendant may be entitled to release on bail. If the accused cannot post a monetary bail, they will appear at their arraignment where the judge will determine if the bail set by the schedule should be lowered.\n\nAlso, in certain states, the prosecution has 48 hours to decide whether or not to file formal charges against the accused. For example, in California, if no formal charges are filed within the 48-hour period, the accused must be released from the arresting host's custody. If formal charges are filed, the accused will be asked to appear at their arraignment. At the arraignment, the accused will be asked to plead guilty or not guilty, and the judge will set a bail amount (or refuse to set bail) for the accused.\n\nIn 2010, the FBI estimated that law enforcement agencies made 13,120,947 arrests (excluding traffic violations). Of those persons arrested, 74.5% were male and 69.4 percent of all persons arrested were white, 28.0 percent were black, and the remaining 2.6 percent were of other ethnicities.\n\nArrests under English law fall into two general categories—with and without a warrant—and then into more specific subcategories. Regardless of what power a person is arrested under, they must be informed that they are under arrest and of the grounds for their arrest at the time or as soon after the arrest as is practicable, otherwise the arrest is unlawful.\n\nA justice of the peace can issue warrants to arrest suspects and witnesses.\n\nThere are four subcategories of arrest without warrant:\n\nUnited States law recognizes the common law arrest under various jurisdictions.\n\nThe police may arrest a person according to a warrant issued by a Magistrate under sections 31, 72, 73 or 74 of the Magistrates Ordinance. For example, an arrest warrant may be issued if an accused person does not appear in Court when he is due to answer a charge.\n\nHowever, an arrest warrant is not always necessary. Under section 50(1) of the Police Force Ordinance, a police officer can \"apprehend\" (i.e. arrest) a person if he reasonably suspects the person being arrested is guilty of an offence. Whether there is such a reasonable suspicion in a particular case is to be determined objectively by reference to facts and information which the arresting officer has at the time of the arrest. It is not necessary that the officer knows the exact statutory provision that the suspect has violated, so long as the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect has done something amounting to an offence.\n\nIn the United Kingdom a person must be told that they are under arrest in simple, non-technical language, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest. A person must be 'cautioned' when being arrested or subject to a criminal prosecution procedure, unless this is impractical due to the behaviour of the arrested person.\n\nThe caution required in England and Wales states,\nYou are under arrest on suspicion of (\"offence\"). You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.\n\nMinor deviations from the words of any caution given do not constitute a breach of the Code of Practise, provided the sense of the caution is preserved.\n\nThe caution required in Scotland states:\n\nYou are not obliged to say anything, but anything you do say will be noted and may be used in evidence.\n\nBased on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in \"Miranda v. Arizona\", after making an arrest, the police must inform the detainee of their Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights in order for statements made during questioning to be admissible as evidence against the detainee in court. A Miranda warning is required only when a person has been taken into custody (i.e. is not free to leave) and is being interrogated, and the results of this interrogation are to be used in court. An officer is not required to inform a person of their Miranda rights if they will not be questioning them any further after their arrest. An officer is also not necessarily required to provide a Miranda warning if the person they are questioning has not been arrested or if a person they have arrested speaks spontaneously without being questioned. There is also an exception that permits questioning without providing the warning under circumstances involving urgent matters of public safety.\n\nThe warning must inform the detainee that they have the right to be silent, the right to legal council (and the availability of pro bono legal assistance), and that what they say can be used against them. The failure to provide a detainee with an adequate warning could make information obtained from an interrogation inadmissible in court, but does not prevent other evidence from being used to obtain a conviction. As in the British system, the exact phrasing of the warning is not explicitly mandated under federal law. There are also additional requirements about the warning that vary from state to state and may depend on the circumstances (such as when the arrestee is a non-citizen or juvenile). Since the exact wording used in an arrest is legally important, police officers often carry a printed copy of the rights with them and read from it when providing the warning to ensure accuracy.\n\nImmediately after the arrest, the police must inform you of your right to remain silent. You may choose whether or not to answer any questions posed by the police (except that you may need to provide your name and address to the police). The police officer will caution you by saying,\n\"You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say will be put into writing and may be given in evidence.\" \n\nBreach of a court order can be considered civil contempt of court, and a warrant for the person's arrest may be issued. Some court orders contain authority for a police officer to make an arrest without further order.\n\nIf a legislature lacks a quorum, many jurisdictions allow the members present the power to order a call of the house, which orders the arrest of the members who are not present. A member arrested is brought to the body's chamber to achieve a quorum. The member arrested does not face prosecution, but may be required to pay a fine to the legislative body.\n\nWhile an arrest will not necessarily lead to a criminal conviction, it may nonetheless in some jurisdictions have serious ramifications such as absence from work, social stigma, and in some cases, the legal obligation to disclose a conviction when a person applies for a job, a loan or a professional license. In the United States a person who was not found guilty after an arrest can remove their arrest record through an expungement or (in California) a finding of factual innocence. A cleared person has the choice to file a complaint or a lawsuit if they choose to. Legal action is sometimes filed against the government after a wrongful arrest.\n\nFor convictions, the collateral consequences are more severe in the United States than in the UK, where arrests without conviction do not appear in standard criminal record checks and need not be disclosed, whereas in the United States, people have to expunge or (if the case goes to court) seal arrest without convictions, or if the charges are dropped. However, in the UK, 'Enhanced' CRB disclosures permit a Chief Constable to disclose this data if they believe it relevant to the post for which the CRB disclosure was applied.\n\n\n\n"}

The second son in the family of Shiv Chand, a head clerk in the Irrigation Department, he would go on create history in the world of Indian and Punjabi literature.\n\nGargi studied at Government College Lahore, and completed his M.A.(English) and M.A.(Political Science) from FC College in Lahore. He also studied theatre with Norah Richards at her school in Kangra Valley.\n\nGargi wrote several plays, including \"Loha Kutt\", \"Kesro\", \"Kanak Di Balli\", \"Sohni Mahiwal\", \"Sultan Razia\", \"Soukan\", \"Mirza Sahiba\" and \"Dhooni di Agg\" and short stories \"Mircha Wala Sadh\", \"Pattan di Berhi\" and \"Kuari Disi\". His plays were translated into 12 languages, and have been performed around the world, including Moscow, London, New Delhi and around the United States.\n\nGargi's first play, \"Loha kutt\" (English: \"Blacksmith\") in 1944 became controversial for its stark picture of the Punjab countryside. At that juncture, he focused on poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, and superstition marking rural life, which continued in \"Saelpathar\" (English: \"Petrified Stone\") in 1949, \"Navan mudh\" (English: \"New Beginning\") in 1950, and \"Ghugi\" (English: \"Dove\") in 1950. In the 1950 edition of Loha kutt, he resorted to drawing poetic and dramatic elements from J. M. Synge and Garcia Lorca. In subsequent works like \"Kanak di balli\" (English: \"Stalk of Wheat\") in 1968 and \"Dhuni di agg\" (English: \"Fire in the Furnace\") in 1977, these became his chief vehicles. For all the specificity of native locale, the former deflected as much towards Lorca's \"Blood Wedding\" as the latter reminded one of Yerma. In \"Mirza-Sahiban\" in 1976, customs and conventions came in for bitter censure. Gradually, Gargi's preoccupation with sex, violence, and death became almost an obsession. Antonin Artaud`s theatre of cruelty grew into his categorical imperative. This required his dramaturgy to proceed through mythopoeia, which turns explicit in his last plays.\n\nIn \"Saunkan\" (English: \"Rival Women\") in 1979, the paradigm of Yama-Yami, the Hindu god of death and his twin sister, becomes an occasion to glorify sexual union. Altogether dispensing with socio-political discourse, he turned to his new theme with a vengeance in \"Abhisarka\" (English: \"Lover\") in 1990. Gargi's penchant for the unexpected grew all-powerful.\n\nFor subject matter Gargi moved freely over social milieu, mythology, history, and folklore. For form and technique he relied as much upon Sanskrit classics as on Lorca's poetic drama, Brecht's epic theatre, or Artaud's theatre of cruelty. In the composition and performance of his dozen full-length plays and five collections of one-act drama, he traveled from the realistic to the mythopoeic mode.\n\nIn addition to this dramatic corpus, Gargi's short stories began to be published in English. A book, \"Folk Theatre of India\", published in New York City and two semi-autobiographical novels in English and Punjabi, \"The Naked Triangle\" (\"Nangi Dhup\") and \"The Purple Moonlight (Kashni Vehra)\" brought him to the forefront of cosmopolitan attention.\n\nBalwant Gargi was among the pioneers of playwriting in Punjabi and the production and telecast of his plays like \"Sanjha Chulha\" on Doordarshan received countrywide appreciation\n\nGargi was awarded the Sahitya Akademi award, the highest Indian literary award, in 1962 for his book \"Rang Manch\". This was followed by the Padma Shri (1972), and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in Punjabi Playwriting in 1998. Gargi is one of the few artists to win both the Sahitya Akademi and Sangeet Natak Akademi awards.\n\nBalwant Gargi taught for two years (1966–67) at the University of Washington, where he met Jeanne Henry, who later became his wife. This period was the basis of his autobiography \"The Naked Triangle\".\n\nBalwant Gargi was the founder-director of the Indian Theatre Department, Panjab University, Chandigarh. The open-air theatre at the department is named after him. His students include Anupam Kher, Kiron Kher, Satish Kaushik, Poonam Dhillon, and many other current Bollywood stars.\n\nOver the years, Gargi lectured and taught as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Harvard University, Vassar College, Mount Holyoke College, Trinity College, the University of Hawai'i, Yale University, and many other renowned international institutions.\n\nHis children, Manu Gargi and Jannat Gargi, are settled in the United States. Manu is a producer of films in Hollywood.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24344881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24344881", "title": "Bulgarian phonology", "text": "Bulgarian phonology\n\nThis article discusses the phonological system of Standard Bulgarian. Most scholars agree that contemporary Bulgarian has 45 phonemes but different authors place the real number of Bulgarian phonemes between 42 and 47, depending on whether one includes or excludes phonemes which appear primarily only in borrowed foreign words.\n\nBulgarian vowels may be grouped in three pairs according to their backness: the front vowels е () and и (), the central vowels а (, ) and ъ (, ) and the back vowels о (, ) and у (, ). In stressed syllables, six vowels are phonemic. Unstressed vowels tend to be shorter and weaker compared to their stressed counterparts, and the corresponding pairs of open and closed vowels approach each other with a tendency to merge, above all as low (open and open-mid) vowels are raised and shift towards the high (close and close-mid) ones. However, the coalescence is not always complete. The vowels are often distinguished in emphatic or deliberately distinct pronunciation, and reduction is strongest in colloquial speech. Besides that, some linguists distinguish two degrees of reduction, as they have found that a clearer distinction tends to be maintained in the syllable immediately preceding the stressed one. The complete merger of the pair – is regarded as most common, while the status of vs is less clear. The coalescence of and is not allowed in formal speech and is regarded as a provincial (East Bulgarian) dialectal feature; instead, unstressed is both raised and centralized, approaching . The vowel itself does not exist as a phoneme in other Slavic languages, though a similar reduced vowel transcribed as does occur.\n\nThe Bulgarian language possesses only one semivowel: . Orthographically it is represented by the Cyrillic letter ( with a breve) as in ('most'), ('trolleybus'), except when it precedes or (and their reduced counterparts and ), in which case each of the two phonemes is represented by a single letter, respectively or : e.g. ('flat iron'), but ('Jordan').\n\nBulgarian has a total of 35 consonant phonemes (see table below). Three additional phonemes can also be found (, , and ), but only in foreign proper names such as ('Houston'), ('Dzerzhinsky'), and , ('Jadzia'). They are, however, normally not considered part of the phonetic inventory of the Bulgarian language. The Bulgarian obstruent consonants are divided into 12 pairs of voiced and voiceless consonants. The only obstruent without a counterpart is the voiceless velar fricative . The voicing contrast is neutralized in word-final position, where all obstruents are voiceless, at least with regard to the official orthoepy of the contemporary Bulgarian spoken language (word-final devoicing is a common feature in Slavic languages); this neutralization is, however, not reflected in the spelling.\n\nAn alternative analysis, however, treats the palatalized variants of consonant sounds as sequences of the consonant and (for example, is analyzed as ). This effectively reduces the consonant inventory to merely 22 phonemes. No ambiguity rises from such analysis since the palatalized consonants occur only before vowels, and never before other consonants or in the syllable coda as they do in some other languages with palatalized consonants (for example, in the fellow Slavic language, Russian).\n\nLike a number of Eastern Slavic languages, most consonant phonemes come in \"hard\" and \"soft\" pairs. The latter tend to feature palatalization, or the raising of the tongue toward the hard palate. Thus, for example, contrasts with by the latter being palatalized. The consonants , , , and are considered hard and do not have palatalized variants, though they may have palatalization in some speakers' pronunciation.\n\nThe distinction between hard and soft consonants is clear in Bulgarian orthography, where hard consonants are considered normal and precede either , , , , or . Soft consonants appear before , , or . In certain contexts, the contrast hard/soft contrast is neutralized. For example, in Eastern dialects, only soft consonants appear before and . varies: one of its allophones, involving a raising of the back of the tongue and a lowering of its middle part (thus similar or, according to some scholars, identical to a velarized lateral), occurs in all positions, except before the vowels and , where a more \"clear\" version with a slight raising of the middle part of the tongue occurs. The latter pre-front realization is traditionally called \"soft l\" (though it is not phonetically palatalized). In some Western Bulgarian dialects, this allophonic variation does not exist.\n\nFurthermore, in the speech of many young people the more common and arguably velarized allophone of is often realized as a labiovelar approximant . This phenomenon, sometimes colloquially referred to as ('lazy l') in Bulgaria, was first registered in the 1970s and isn't connected to original dialects. Similar developments, termed L-vocalization, have occurred in many languages, including Polish, Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Brazilian Portuguese and certain dialects of English such as Cockney and AAVE.\n\nDuring the palatalization of most hard consonants (the bilabial, labiodental and alveolar ones), the middle part of the tongue is lifted towards the palate, resulting in the formation of a second articulatory centre whereby the specific palatal \"clang\" of the soft consonants is achieved. The articulation of alveolars , and , however, usually does not follow that rule; the palatal clang is achieved by moving the place of articulation further back towards the palate so that , and are actually alveopalatal (postalvelolar) consonants. Soft and ( and , respectively) are articulated not on the velum but on the palate and are considered palatal consonants.\n\nStress is not usually signified in written text. In cases where the stress must be indicated, a grave accent is placed on the vowel of the stressed syllable. \n\nBulgarian word stress is \"dynamic\". Stressed syllables are louder and longer than unstressed ones. As in Russian and other East Slavic languages, Bulgarian stress is also \"lexical\" rather than \"fixed\" as in French, Latin or the West Slavic languages. It may fall on any syllable of a polysyllabic word, and its position may vary depending on the inflection and derivation, for example:\n\nBulgarian stress is also \"distinctive\": the following examples are not only differentiated by stress (see the different vowels):\n\nStress usually isn't signified in written text, even in the above examples, if the context makes the meaning clear. However, the grave accent may be written if confusion is likely. \n\nThe stress is often written in order to signify a dialectal deviation from the standard pronunciation:\n\n"}

Open-ended questions are sometimes phrased as a statement which requires a response.\n\nA closed-ended question contrasts with an open-ended question, which cannot easily be answered with specific information.\n\nExamples of close-ended questions which may elicit a \"yes\" or \"no\" response include:\n\nSimilarly, variants of the above close-ended questions which possess specific responses are:\n\nAt the same time, there are closed-ended questions which are sometimes impossible to answer correctly with a yes or no without confusion, for example: \"Have you stopped taking heroin?\" (if you never took it) or \"Who told you to take heroin?\"; see \"loaded question\".\n\nA study by the University of Cincinnati found 20 to 40 percent of Americans will provide an opinion when they do not have one because of social pressure, using context clues to select an answer they believe will please the questioner. A classic example of this phenomenon was the 1947 study of the fictional Metallic Metals Act.\n\nSome in the field of education argue that closed-ended questions are broadly speaking \"bad\" questions. They are questions that are often asked to obtain a specific answer and are therefore good for testing knowledge. It is often argued that open-ended questions (i.e. questions that elicit more than a yes/no answers) are preferable because they open up discussion and enquiry.\n\nPeter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are \"grammatically closed, but conceptually open\". For example, in standard parlance, \"is it ever right to lie?\" would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes–no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes–no answer to it can be \"opened up\" by the questioner (\"why do you think that?\", \"Could there be an instance where that's not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry.\n\nThis grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, \"gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question\". Closed questions, simply require \"opening up\" strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential.\n\nWorley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention \"Open Questioning Mindset\" (OQM). OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student's contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls \"guess what's in my head\" teaching, that relies on closed and leading questions.\n\n"}

It is named for Paul Erdős and András Hajnal.\n\nMore precisely, for an arbitrary undirected graph formula_1, let formula_2 be the family of graphs that do not have formula_1 as an induced subgraph. Then, according to the conjecture, there exists a constant formula_4 such that the formula_5-vertex graphs in formula_2 have either a clique or an independent set of size formula_7.\n\nAn equivalent statement to the original conjecture is that, for every graph formula_1, the formula_1-free graphs all contain polynomially large perfect induced subgraphs.\n\nIn contrast, for random graphs in the Erdős–Rényi model with edge probability 1/2, both the maximum clique and the maximum independent set are much smaller: their size is proportional to the logarithm of formula_5, rather than growing polynomially. Ramsey's theorem proves that no graph has both its maximum clique size and maximum independent set size smaller than logarithmic. Ramsey's theorem also implies the special case of the Erdős–Hajnal conjecture when formula_1 itself is a clique or independent set.\n\nThis conjecture is due to Paul Erdős and András Hajnal, who proved it to be true when formula_1 is a cograph. They also showed, for arbitrary formula_1, that the size of the largest clique or independent set grows superlogarithmically. More precisely, for every formula_1 there is a constant formula_15 such that the formula_5-vertex formula_1-free graphs have cliques or independent sets containing at least formula_18 vertices. The graphs formula_1 for which the conjecture is true also include the four-vertex path graph, the five-vertex bull graph, and any graph that can be obtained from these and the cographs by modular decomposition.\nAs of 2014, however, the full conjecture has not been proven, and remains an open problem.\n\nAn earlier formulation of the conjecture, also by Erdős and Hajnal and still unsolved, concerns the special case when formula_1 is a 5-vertex cycle graph. The formula_21-free graphs include the perfect graphs, which necessarily have either a clique or independent set of size proportional to the square root of their number of vertices. Conversely, every clique or independent set is itself perfect. For this reason, a convenient and symmetric reformulation of the Erdős–Hajnal conjecture is that for every graph formula_1, the formula_1-free graphs necessarily contain an induced perfect subgraph of polynomial size.\n\n"}

Laos has the second largest Francophone community in Southeast Asia, the others being found in Vietnam and Cambodia. French is used as a diplomatic and commercial language and is also studied by over a third of students in Laos.\n\nThe French language was introduced to Laos in the 19th century when French explorers arrived in Laos trying to make inroads into China after colonizing Vietnam. The French did not pay much attention to the kingdom of Lan Xang but established a consulate in present-day Luang Prabang. The actual catalysts for the establishment of colonial protectorate over Lao cultural regions were French fears of economic and political competition from Britain. By the 1890s, border disputes with Siam and France led to the Franco-Siamese War and the borders of Laos and Siam were established in favor of France and Laos became a French protectorate. Unlike in Vietnam, the French did not pursue to fully exert their influence in Laos and it was not until the 1900s that French began to be introduced into schools in Laos, but it was mostly limited to Vientiane. However, French rule finally gained firmer ground and French soon became the primary language of government and education and the language spread into southern Laos following the founding of Pakse. The French language peaked between the 1910s and World War II and spread throughout the nation but, like Vietnam, was not widely spoken in most rural areas. French eventually became the language of government officials and the elite. When Japan invaded Laos in World War II, French remained in the educational system, unlike in Vietnam, where Vietnamese became the sole language of education, but the Lao language was briefly used in the government. French returned as the sole political language after France resumed its rule of Laos and was co-official with Lao when Laos was granted self-rule in 1949, but Lao became the sole official language after independence in 1953.\n\nThe French language's decline was slower and occurred later than in Vietnam and Cambodia in Laos as the monarchy of Laos had close political relations with France. At the eve of the Vietnam War, the Secret War was beginning in Laos as political factions between communist Pathet Lao and the government occurred. Pathet Lao held areas used Lao as their sole language and following the end of the Vietnam War, French began its sharp decline in Laos. Additionally, many elite and French-educated Lao immigrated to nations such as the United States and France to escape government persecution. With the end of isolationism in the early 1990s however, the French language rebounded, thanks to the establishment of French, Swiss and Canadian relations and opening of French-language centers in central Laos. Today, French has a healthier status in Laos than the other Francophone nations of Asia and about 35% of all students in Laos receive their education in French, with the language being a required course in many schools. French is also used in public works in central and southern Laos and Luang Prabang and is a language of diplomacy and of the elite classes, higher professions and elders. However, the English language has continued to threaten the French language in Laos as it is seen as the language of international commerce and some schools have also made English a mandatory subject. Laos is also a member of La Francophonie.\n\nThe French spoken in Laos is based on standard Parisian French but has some minor differences in vocabulary as in other French dialects of Asia. Mixtures of Lao are sometimes added into French, giving it a local flavor. Some Lao words that have found their way into the French language are used in Laos as well. There are some notable differences between Lao and standard French such as:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1135529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1135529", "title": "Hardiness (plants)", "text": "Hardiness (plants)\n\nHardiness of plants describes their ability to survive adverse growing conditions. It is usually limited to discussions of climatic adversity. Thus a plant's ability to tolerate cold, heat, drought, flooding, or wind are typically considered measurements of hardiness. Hardiness of plants is defined by their native extent's geographic location: longitude, latitude and elevation. These attributes are often simplified to a hardiness zone. In temperate latitudes, the term most often describes resistance to cold, or \"cold-hardiness\", and is generally measured by the lowest temperature a plant can withstand. Hardiness of a plant is usually divided into two categories: tender, and hardy. Some sources also use the erroneous terms \"Half-hardy\" or \"Fully hardy\". Tender plants are those killed by freezing temperatures, while hardy plants survive freezing—at least down to certain temperatures, depending on the plant. \"Half-hardy\" is a term used sometimes in horticulture to describe bedding plants which are sown in heat in winter or early spring, and planted outside after all danger of frost has passed. \"Fully hardy\" usually refers to plants being classified under the Royal Horticultural Society classifications, and can often cause confusion to those not using this method.\n\nPlants vary a lot in their tolerance of growing conditions. The selective breeding of varieties capable of withstanding particular climates forms an important part of agriculture and horticulture. Plants adapt to changes in climate on their own to some extent. Part of the work of nursery growers of plants consists of cold hardening, or hardening off their plants, to prepare them for likely conditions in later life.\n\nWinter-hardy plants grow during the winter, or at least remain healthy and dormant. Apart from hardy evergreens, these include many cultivated plants, including varieties of cabbage and broccoli, and all kinds of carrot. Some bulbs – such as tulips – need cold winters to bloom, while others – such as freesia – can survive a freezing winter. Many domestic plants are assigned a hardiness zone that specifies the climates in which they can survive. Winter gardens are dependent upon the cultivation of winter-hardy plants.\n\nWoody plants survive freezing temperatures by suppressing the formation of ice in living cells or by allowing water to freeze in plant parts that are not affected by ice formation. The common mechanism for woody plants to survive up to –40 °C (–40 °F) is supercooling. Woody plants that survive lower temperatures are dehydrating their cells, allowing water to freeze between cell walls and the cells to survive. Plants normally considered hardy may not survive freezing if they are not readily acclimated, which renders them unable to use these mechanisms.\n\nVarious hardiness ratings are published. In the USA, the most widely used is the USDA system of hardiness zones based on average minimum yearly temperatures. This system was developed specifically for the extremely diverse range of conditions in the United States (US), from baking desert to frozen tundra. Another commonly used system is the Sunset Climate Zone system . This system is much more specific to climates (i.e. precipitation, temperature, and humidity based) and less dependent on the yearly minimum.\n\nIn contrast the United Kingdom (UK) and Western Europe have an oceanic climate, and experience a narrower range of temperatures that is tempered by the presence of the Gulf Stream. This results in areas like western Scotland experiencing relatively mild winter conditions that enable the growing of subtropical plants, despite being well to the north of subtropical climate areas. The Royal Horticultural Society has published a set of hardiness ratings applicable to the UK. The ratings range from H1a to H7. H1a, higher than , applies to tropical plants permanently under glass in heat; while H7, below , applies to very cold-tolerant plants such as heathers. Most outdoor plants in the UK fall within the range H4, (hardy in the average winter) to H5, (hardy in a cold winter). Also, the average minimum temperature in the UK is much warmer than the average minimums in most of the US (see Hardiness Zone ). This means that the coldest areas in the UK would be considered USDA Zone 7, plants considered 'Fully Hardy' in the UK may not be hardy below Zone 7 in the US.\n\nIn addition to cold tolerance, plant hardiness has been observed to be linked to how much stress specific plants are undergoing into the winter, or even how fast the onset of cold weather is in a specific year. This means that often stressed plants will exhibit less cold tolerance than plants that have been well maintained. Plants may also die if the winter changes from balmy to exceptionally cold in a short period of time.\n\n\n\n"}

He was appointed as associate professor of Bengali at the University of Dhaka on 1 November 1978 and got promoted to the post of professor in 1986.\n\nTowards the end of the 1980s, he started to write newspaper column focusing on contemporary sociopolitical issues. His commentaries continued throughout the 1990s and were later published as books as they grew in numbers. Through his writings of the 1990s, he established himself as a freethinker and appeared to be an agnostic. In his works, he openly criticized Islamic extremism, as well as the conservative society-system of Bangladesh.\n\nIn 1992 Azad published the first comprehensive feminist book in Bengali titled \"Naari\" (\"Woman\"). \"Naari\" received positive reviews as a literary work and earned Azad popularity as an author. In this work Azad painstakingly compiled the feminist ideas of the West that underlie the feminist contributions of the subcontinent's socio-political reformers and drew attention to the anti-women attitude of some acclaimed Bengali writers including Rabindranath Tagore. The work, critical of the patriarchal and male-chauvinistic attitude of religion towards women, attracted negative reaction from the conservatives. The Government of Bangladesh banned the book in 1995. The ban was eventually lifted in 2000, following a legal battle that Azad won in the High Court of the country.\n\nOn 27 February 2004, near the campus of the University of Dhaka during the annual Bangla Academy book fair, two assailants, armed with chopping knives, hacked Azad several times on the jaw, lower part of the neck and hands. Azad was taken to the nearby Dhaka Medical College and Hospital. He was then sent to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) and later to Bumrungrad International Hospital in Thailand where he recovered.\n\nAzad had been fearing for his life ever since excerpts of his new novel, \"Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad\" (Pakistan's national anthem; \"Blessed be the Sacred Land\") were first published in \"The Daily Ittefaq\"s Eid supplement in 2003. In that write-up, he tried to expose the politics and ideology of Islamic fundamentalists of Bangladesh. After that book had been published, he started receiving various threats from the fundamentalists. In an email to Mukto-mona, a website for secularists and liberals, where he was then a member, Azad wrote:\n\nA week prior to Azad's assault, Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, one of the renowned religious leaders of Bangladesh demanded, in the parliament, that Azad's political satire \"Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad\" would be banned and demanded the introduction of the Blasphemy Act on the author. In 2006, the commander of Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) admitted to the RAB interrogators that his operatives carried out the attack on writer Azad, as well as two other murders, bomb blasts, and attacks on cinemas.\n\nOn 12 August 2004, Azad was found dead in his apartment in Munich, Germany, where he had arrived a week earlier to conduct research on the nineteenth century German romantic poet Heinrich Heine, several months after the Islamists' machete attack on him at a book fair, which had left him grievously injured. His family demanded an investigation, alleging that the extremists who had attempted the earlier assassination had a role in this death. While alive, Azad had expressed his wish to donate his body to medical college after his death. But he was buried in Rarhikhal, his village home in Bangladesh as doctors denied to take his body for medical research, as several days had passed to reach his body to Bangladesh from Germany.\n\nAzad married his Dhaka University class-mate Latifa Kohinoor on 12 October 1975. They lived in Scotland for an year before they returned to Dhaka. Together they had two daughters Smita and Mouli and one son, Anannya.\n"}

The importance of tack is that it is not so excessive that it doesn't allow effective transfer from the rollers to the plate and then to the blanket and onto the substrate being printed. Inks can also be tack \"graded\" in descending sequence to allow for better trapping of one color over another. Inks with too much tack can cause the surface of the paper to pick off and interfere with transfer on subsequent printing units and copies.\n\nThe amount of tack can be controlled by changing the amount of solvent or other diluent used in the ink. \n\nThe inkometer is made up of three rollers. The center roller is a temperature controlled brass roller, the bottom roller is an oscillating rubber distribution roller. The top roller is attached to a load cell which measures the tack at a given press speed (i.e. 800 feet per minute for a web press or 15000 sheets per hour for an offset press)\n"}

(born 26 April 1936) is an eminent litterateur from Odisha who has dominated the Odia literary scene for over forty years. His literary oeuvre comprise poetry, plays, short stories, novel, essays, children’s poems and nonsense verse. He has done translations of literary works from different languages into Odia and English. He has done extensive research into Odishan art and has published three works on the pictorial arts of the state. He has also done paintings, acted on stage and in films, and taken an active part in social and cultural movements. His writings have been widely translated into Hindi, English and other Indian languages, bringing him national recognition. He has been honoured with awards for his writings, the important ones being the Central Sahitya Akademi award for his poetry (which he refused), the Nandikar Award for plays, the Sarala Award for short stories and the Saraswati Samman for his poetry. He has been connected with literary, cultural, and charitable organisations and has been member/office holder of these bodies.\n\nStarting his career with a brief teaching assignment as Assistant Professor in the University of Allahabad, he joined the Indian Administrative Service and had held many important positions in the Government of Odisha and the Central Government. He has chosen to settle down in Delhi after taking premature retirement from Government service and is a well-known figure in the cultural and social life of the city where he lives.\n\nIt would come as no surprise that Prof.Sumanyu Satpathy has titled a short biographical piece he has written on him The Artist as Polumetis, the Greek term meaning \"many-mindedness\".\n\nJ.P.Das was born on 26 April 1936 to Shridhar Das and Indu Devi at Banpur in the Puri District of Odisha. His father Shridhar Das, an eminent literatteur, was then teaching at the Banpur High School. Banpur is a village and Das studied in the local ‘vernacular’ school. Shridhar moved to Cuttack as Professor in the Christ College there and the family moved there in 1948. J P enrolled in the Mission School (later called the Christ Collegiate School) and passed the matriculation examination from there (1951). He did his Intermediate in Arts from the Christ College (1953) and Bachelor of Arts (Honours) from Ravenshaw College, Cuttack (1955). He was a good student and secured high ranks in all the examinations. He moved to Allahabad to do his Master of Arts in Political Science which he passed in 1957 topping the list of successful candidates.\n\nJ.P. Das started writing poetry from his school days and one of his earliest poems was published in the reputed Odia literary journal Kumkum in 1949 when he was thirteen years old. He regularly contributed to Odia literary journals and shared space with many literary luminaries of the time. In 1951, he brought out a collection of 39 of his poems titled Stabaka (meaning 'Bouquet', published by Odisha Publishing House, Cuttack, priced four annas. He continued writing poetry and was considered a major young voice in Odia poetry. However, he stopped writing when he moved to Allahabad. His next collection of poems was to appear only in 1971.\n\nJP has not included these early poems in his later anthologies considering them juvenilia. However, many readers of his early poems still remember the words of those poems and feel that they should not be excluded from the corpus of his poems.\n\nJ P Das joined the IAS in 1958 and was allotted the Odisha cadre. His earliest posting was to Rourkella as Subdivisional Officer. He thereafter worked in several Departments of Government of Odisha, and was Secretary of the Departments of Works and Transport, Industries, and Finance at different times. In 1973, he was deputed to the Central Government in Delhi and worked in the Commerce and the Finance Ministries. In 1976, he did his M.Phil in the Indian Institute of Public Administration, and took a Homi Bhabha fellowship to research. After completing the fellowship, he joined as the Resident Commissioner of the Government of Odisha at Delhi from which post he took premature retirement in 1984.\n\nJ P is on record saying that of the years he spent in Government service, he considers the three years he spent in Kalahandi district of Odisha as Collector and District Magistrate as the most rewarding and fulfilling of his career.\n\nJ P Das was posted to Kalahandi in 1963, when the district was one of the most backward ones having a substantial tribal population and lacking in basic facilities. The district faced severe drought in 1965, which necessitated tremendous efforts by the administration to provide relief to ameliorate the condition of the famine-stricken population. He has written about the problems he had faced when he stopped the export of food grains outside the district, though his order was rescinded by the Government. The authorities had to permit import rice at a later date. J P Das has written a poem on Kalahandi, which has gained an almost classic status.\n\nJ.P.Das considers poetry his first love. He is also on record saying: \"All that I want to say, let me say in poetry\". Writing poems from an early age, he published his first collection of poems in 1951, which he later called immatured. His next collection Prathama Purusha came out after a twenty-year hiatus in 1971 and made a great impact on the Odia poetry scene. The poems were hailed as free from the existing trends in poetry and received rave reviews. Translation of the collection soon followed and was equally well-received. Mulk Raj Anand called the translated poems in First Person \"authentic poetic expression in new metaphor\". Of the Urdu translation, a review said: \"Das’s sensibility is easily comparable with that of Faiz in Urdu\".\n\nGiven below are some comments on his poetry at different times.\n\n- \"If contemporary Odia poetry has acquired a new dimension and sophistication in terms of vision, technical integrity and innovative use of the creative medium, it was because of J.P.Das's contribution.\" - Kavya Bharati,1997\n\n- \"An unusual blending of the sense of beauty and the sense of joy in living and loving makes his poetry extremely readable and accessible. His passion for the diverse facets of life and existence makes his poetry vibrant and rejuvenating. The sense of rhythm that he tries to capture in his poetry is very close to the colloquial speech.\"-Kavya Bharati, Madurai, Issue 13, 2001\n\n- \"J.P.Das's collection of poems] is authentic poetic expressions in new metaphors.\" - Mulk Raj Anand\n\n- \"There is no self-indulgent practicing here; form and language suggest a strong, mature personality.\" - Nissim Ezekiel\n\n- \"His poetry is universal as true poetry should be and ranks with some of the best in any language.\" - Vassilis Vitsaxis\n\n- \"The world that J.P.Das creates is both magical and historical, lost and redeemed.\" - Mary O'Connor\n\n- \"J.P.Das's is a poetry of concern, of dread and angst in a world growing darker day by day...its virtues are to be sought in its moral earnestness and its faithfulness to the gruesome reality of our times of torment.\" - K. Satchidanandan\n\nJ.P.Das held the first (and only) exhibition of sixteen of his paintings in 1971 at Bhubaneswar. His formal training in Art was joining the diploma course of fine arts at the Allahabad University, which he could not finish.\n\nThough painted by an amateur Sunday artist, the paintings got some good reviews. Dr. Dinanath Pathy wrote: \"It is not necessary that one should go through a training course in fine arts to make a good artist….All the sixteen canvases on display were marked with a freshness and individuality, which clearly indicated a good artist in the making…..With his vision and sincerity, he will one day establish himself one day as a true artist.\" Prof. Inam Ansari, another reviewer wrote: \"Given time and maturity, Das is sure to succeed and prove a worthy member of the artist fraternity\".\n\nBut this was not to be, for Das stopped this creative activity and thus ended the short period of his career as visual artist.\n\nJ.P.Das wrote his first short-story in 1980, many years after publishing poetry. His very first short-story attracted attention for the novelty of its theme as well as for the use of a new style and language for Odia fiction. Since then, he has alternated between poetry and prose and given both equal attention.\n\nHe is now as much known as a fiction writer as a poet, and his collection of short stories has been awarded the prestigious Sarala Award. Many of his short stories have been produced as television films.\n\nGiven below are some appreciations of his short stories:\n\n- \"His stories draw a map of India whereby seemingly incontestable categories, widely accepted beliefs and traditions associated with the national identity collapse…. The stories gain a deeper, unstated meaning as they provide an acid critique of a country largely transformed under the pressures of globalization…. J.P.Das’s characters re-validate the assertion that the authentic re-appropriation of one’s cultural space remains by and large one of the most critical unfinished agendas of our time.\" - Mauricio D. Aguilera Linde\n\n- \"J.P.Das is the quintessential raconteur with an instinctive mastery of form.\" - The Hindu\n\n- \"J.P.Das’s stories begin with clinical and detached descriptions…but at some point, imperceptively, the mood changes and we find ourselves in an uncharted territory, where shadows of unresolved mysteries darken the surface of quotidian life.\" - Meenakshi Mukherjee\n\n- \"Epiphanies and liquid perceptions are subtly phased into one another, characters and situations multiply and recreate themselves and mature as the whole seems to be spawned by an intelligent camera.\" - The Book Review\n\n- \"A feature of J.P.Das’s stories is the slow, deliberate accretion of detail that seems calculated to make the reader breathless and impatient, driving him on to the inevitable climax, which provides a sense of relief as well as disbelief.\" - Bikram K. Das\n\n- \"He occupies a special place in the history of the Odia short story, having helped to modernise it by expanding its horizon and by his unusual angles of approach….JP is one among the few living contemporary Odia writers who is astute in mapping the relations between writing and social power as they obtain in a provincial milieu.\" - Himansu S. Mohapatra\n\nJ.P.Das wrote two short plays in 1960 and then wrote his first full-length play \"Suryasta Purbaru\" (translated into English as \"Before the Sunset\") in 1971. This play was staged in a Bengali version in Kolkata the next year, even before it was staged in Odia in Odisha. In 1976, the Hindi version was performed in Delhi directed by the eminent theatre personality Ram Gopal Bajaj. Om Puri played the role of the protagonist Deepankar in the play. The play has since been translated into many other languages and staged in different parts of the country giving it the status of a classic. It is included in the volume \"Modern Indian Plays\" published by the National School of Drama.\n\nHis second play \"Saba Shesha Loka\" (translated into English as [\"The Underdogs\"]) was also produced in the Hindi version first, directed by eminent theatre and film personality Ravi Baswani. Thespian Pankaj Kapoor essayed the important role of Ram/Shyam in the play.\n\nA subsequent play of his, \"Sundardas\", was staged by the Department of Art and Aesthetics of the Jawaharlal Nehru University directed by the renowned playwright and theatre-person H.S.Shiva Prakash. It was also staged under the auspices of Indira Gandhi National Centre of Arts.\n\nJP Das has been closely associated with the new theatre movement in Odisha and is a founder trustee of the Utkal Rangamanch Trust, Bhubaneswar. He has been an office-bearer of Bharatiya Natya Sangh, the Indian branch of International Theatre. He was the Vice-chairman of National School of Drama. He has been honoured with Nandikar Theatre Award Nandikar Award, Kolkata as an eminent playwright.\n\nHe has done some acting on stage too; mention may be made of his role as father in his own play \"Made for Each Other\" and as Fateh Muhammad in Manoranjan Das’s play \"Buxi Jagabandhu\".\n\nBelow are given some comments on J.P.Das’s plays:\n\n- \"J.P.Das is a versatile writer and his plays are literary works at their best. It is hoped that these works of an important Indian playwright will delight both readers and theatre-persons. - Nirmal KantiBhattachraje (in his Introduction to \"Complete Plays\" by J.P.Das)\n\n- \"J.P.Das has now secured his place among the leading playwrights of the country.\" -Enact\n\n- \"J.P.Das is a poet turned playwright and his poetic sensitivity, compassion and perspective inform his plays. He leaves many things to the imagination of the audience or gives only suggestions, as a poet would. But he does succeed in saying many things with a minimum of words.\" -J.N.Kaushal\n\n- \"Sundardas is a significant addition to Indian dramatic literature. The play is an insightful treatment of the politics of conversion.\" - H.S.Shivaprakash\n\nJ.P.Das has been closely associated with cinema, having been an active member of the Bhubaneswar and Delhi Film Societies. He has been on the Boards of Orissa Film Development Corporation and the Children’s Film Society, India. CFSI. He was Chairman of the International Jury of Children’s Film Awards of the international organisation CIFEJ in 1985.\n\nHe was a Member of the International Children’s Film Awards Jury, 1989. He was a Member of the Jury of National Film Awards in the years 1985, 1988 and 1990. He was a Member of the Film Review Committee of the Ministry of Health and Family Planning during 2001-2003.\n\nHe was instrumental in organizing the International Children’s Film Festival in Bhubaneswar in 1987. He has edited a volume \"Films for Children\" published by Vikas Publishing House. He has acted in telefilm Sunaina directed by S.N.Dhir and in the tele-serial Panchhi directed by Ravi Baswani. Many of his short stories have been made into telefilms.\n\nJ.P.Das has written one historical novel, a fictional account of Odisha in the second half of the 19th century. In its six hundred pages, it gives a panoramic picture of the political, social, cultural and literary history of the State of Odisha. Published in 1992, it has already got into several editions and has gained the status of a literary classic.\n\nThe book was chosen for translation into all Indian languages by the National Book Trust under their Aadaan Pradaan scheme, and it has been translated into Hindi, Bengali and English. A film project based on the book is under way.\n\nIn his translator’s note to the English translation \"A Time Elsewhere\", published by Penguin Books, Prof. Jatindra K. Nayak has the following to say about the book: \"It tells the story of the transformation of a traditional society under the impact of colonial rule...it seeks to construct an alternate narrative in which the colonised is not content to be only written about; he is seen as shaping his own destiny.\" muse India\n\nBesides translating some of his own work in Odia into English, he has also translated other works in different languages into both Odia and English. He has translated \"Odia Women Poets’ Work\" into English (with Arlene Zide), Catherine Clement’s poems from French into English (with the poet), Gulzar’s poems from Urdu into English, Swedish poet Werner Aspenstrom’s poems into Odia, a medieval Odia text \"Lakshmipurana\" into English and the poetry of Odia Dalit poet Basudev Sunani into English.\n\nHe edited the first ever anthology of Odia Short Stories in English translation. He has edited an anthology of poetry from different Indian languages ( with K.Satchidanandan), and a volume of essays, Films for Children.\n\nJ.P.Das has been awarded the following Fellowships for research and creative writing:\n\n\n\nThough Odisha temple sculpture and architecture has been studied by scholars for a long time, no such study had been done of the rich tradition of pictorial arts of Odisha. This shortcoming was made good with the publication of J.P.Das’s \"Puri Paintings: The Chitrakara and His Work\" (Arnold-Heinemann, New Delhi and Humanities Press, New Jersey, USA) in 1982. It was the first book on the distinctive Pata style of painting of Odisha and received rave reviews on its publication.\n\nDr. Eberhard Fischer had the following to say in his review of the book in Artibus Asiae, 2/3 1983: \"This book is an important contribution to our knowledge of traditional painters’ role and of Orissa’s rich artistic heritage…. The text is well-written, scholarly and clear. The author, a well-known poet and an administrator, deserves high praise for his direct and unpretentious presentation. J.P.Das, also an amateur painter, has been acquainted since his childhood with traditional Orissan paintings and as a young IAS officer was involved in Handicraft Programmes of the Orissan Government. For his thesis, he lived and worked mainly in Raghurajpur near Puri, observed the painters’ way of life and their working techniques, and conducted interviews. Furthermore, he obtained records from the Puri Temple Administration Office, and searched for relevant Civil Court records of Puri and for documents from the American Friends Service Organisation. He finally visited museums, mainly in Calcutta and London, studying their collections of Pata paintings to form his own ideas about historic questions…..What I enjoyed most when reading this important publication is the clear diction and the well-organised layout. J.P.Das is on the whole unprejudiced as a historian and yet critical in all questions concerning general assumptions.\"\n\nMiloslav Krasa, reviewing the book in Archiv Orientalni 54, 1986, wrote: \"This study is a basic and valuable contribution to a long-neglected subject, filling yet another lacuna in our knowledge of the social and cultural history of Orissa.\"\n\n\"Puri Paintings\" has helped in promoting this painting style in India and abroad and has gained respect and recognition of the painters.\n\nJ P Das followed up this book with two other books on the pictorial arts of Orissa: Chitra-Pothi: Illustrated Palm-leaf Manuscripts from Orissa ( Arnold-Heinemann, New Delhi and Lotus Press, London, 1985) and \"Palm-leaf Miniatures: The Art of Raghunath Prusty of Orissa\" (Abhinav Publications, New Delhi,1991). The first of these books is about the art of illuminating kavya texts from medieval Odia literature on palm-leaves. The second book, written in collaboration with Prof. Joanna Williams of the University of Berkeley, California, is about one such palm-leaf artist, Raghunath Prusty who lived in the second half of the nineteenth century. Both books were highly appreciated and well- reviewed. Prof. Pratapaditya Pal wrote in Marg ( Vol.49 No.3 March 1998) : \"The recent research and publications by at least two enthusiasts, among others, will redress the balance [neglect of study of Orissan painting] and Orissan Painting will receive the attention it deserves. The scholars are J.P.Das of India and Joanna Williams of the United States\"\n\nDuring a period of illness in 1991 J.P.Das wrote some nonsense verses as also some poems for children which were published in 1993 in two books under the titles \"Alimalika\" (Publications Division, New Delhi)and \"Alukuchi-Malukuchi\" (Lark Books, Bhubaneswar). Both titles mean ‘odds and ends’ in Odia. Children’s and nonsense writing are rather neglected in Odia and the two books e hence were a pleasant addition to this genre of writing in Odia literature. J P Das himself translated some of the poems from these two books into English and published \"Alimalika: Children’s Nonsense Rhymes\" (Writers Workshop, Calcutta, 2004). In 2008, he published another such collection under the title \"Anabana\" – also meaning ‘odds and ends’ in Odia – (Ink Odisha, Bhubaneswar). Another similar collection by him, written during another period of illness, \"Aanamaana\" was published in 2015.\n\n1.\"Prathama Purusha\" - 1971\n\n2.\"Anya sabu Mrtyu\" - 1976\n\n3.\"Je Jahara Nirjanata - 1979\n\n4.\"Anya Desha Bhinna Samaya\" - 1982\n\n5.\"Jatrara Prathama Pada\" - 1988\n\n6.\"Ahnika\" - 1990\n\n7.\"Sthirachitra\" - 1991\n\n8.\"Sacharachara\" - 1994\n\n9.\"Smrtira Sahara\" - 1995\n\n10.\"Parikrama\" - 1998\n\n11.\"Asamaya\"-2004\n\n12.\"Kabita Samagra\" - Ink Odisha, Bhubaneswar, -2011\n\n1.\"Bhavanatha O Anyamane\" - 1982\n\n2.\"Dinacharya\" - 1983\n\n3.\"Ame Jeunmane\" - 1986\n\n4.\"Sakshatkara\" - 1986\n\n5.\"Priya Bidushaka\" - 1991\n\n6.\"Shesha Paryanta\" -1995\n\n7.\"Icchhapatra\" - 2000\n\n8.\"Indradhanu, Akhi O Kabitara Dirghajibana\" - 2009\n\n1.\"Suryasta Purbaru\" - 1977\n\n2.\"Saba Shesha Loka\" - 1980\n\n3.\"Asangata Nataka\" - 1981\n\n4.\"Purbaraaga\" - 1983\n\n5.\"Sundara Das\" - 1993\n\n1.\"Desha Kala Patra\" - Prachi Prakashan, Bhubaneswar, 1991\n\n1.\"Alimalika\" - Publication Division, Ministry of I and B, Government of India, 1993\n\n2.\"Alukuchi Malukuchi\" - Lark, 1993/Timepass, Bhubaneswar, 1993\n\n3.\"Anabana\" - Ink Odisha, Bhubaneswar, 2008\n\n4.\"Anamana\" - Timepass, Bhubaneswar, 2016\n\n1.\"Svapna-bichara\" - 2000\n\n1.\"Chha'ti Jhia\" - 1987\n\n2.\"Premakabita\" (Poetry) - 1991\n\n3.\"Shreshtha Kabita\" (Poetry) - 1993\n\n4.\"Purbapara-1\"(Samagra Kabita 1970-79) (Poetry) - 1995\n\n5.\"Purbapara-2\"(Samagra Kabita 1980-94) (Poetry) - 1996\n\n6.\"Rangalipi\" - 1997\n\n7.\"Kathajatra\"(Short Stories)- 2000\n\n8.\"Kabita Samagra\"(Poetry) - 2011\n\n9.\"Shreshtha Galpa\" (Short Stories)- 2014\n\n\"Puri Paintings: The Chitrakara and His Work\", Arnold-Heinemann, 1982\n\n\"Chitra-Pothi: Illustrated Palm-leaf Manuscripts\", Arnold-Heinemann, 1985\n\n\"Palm-leaf Miniatures\" (with Joanna Williams), Abhinav Publications, 1991\n\n\"Reflections on Literature and Culture\", Sikshasandhan, 2009\n\n\"Oriya Short Stories\", Vikas Publishing House, 1983\n\n\"Films for Children\", Vikas Publishing House, 1987\n\n\"Kavita 93\" (with K.

{"id": "21184563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21184563", "title": "Kho'ini dialect", "text": "Kho'ini dialect\n\nKho'ini (alternatives: Xoini, Xo'ini, Khoeini, or Di) is a Tatic dialect or language spoken in northwestern Iran, and is one of many Western Iranian languages. It is spoken in the village of Xoin and surrounding areas, about southwest of Zanjan city in northern Iran. The Xoini verbal system follows the general pattern found in other Tati dialects. However, the dialect has its own special characteristics such as continuous present which is formed by the past stem, a preverb shift, and the use of connective sounds. The dialect is in danger of extinction.\n\nKho'in (), also spelled as \"Xo'in\" an \"Khoein\", is located in \"Ejarud\" rural district of Zanjan Province at the end of a long valley. In recent decades the village has lost its centrality because of veering the road of Zanjan to Bijar from Xoin. In 1960, the farmers was growing fruits around on the slopes of the hills, but Xoin's Qanats were neglected; many of the houses deteriorated already and a number of inhabitants had been migrating to Tehran seeking works. The population was 800 to 900 at the time and declining.\n\nThere has been a sense of nostalgia about the better days of Xo'in among the dwellers. Local beliefs hold that in the Qajar period some Xoinis emigrated to Merv, Ashgabat and Baku. There is a cavernous dent called \"Dei-manda\", meaning, \"remnant of a fort\" (known in other parts of Iran as \"Qaleh Gabri/Gowri\"), said to have been made by Zoroastrians. Some villagers legendarily believed that Xoinis had earlier been Gowr. They gave credence to being originally from Sistan. Some said when Bahman invaded Sistan to avenge his father, Esfandiyar, the descendants of Rostam fled and came to Xoin. In spite of dwindling estate, the village has 8 maintained mosques and a Tekyeh.\n\nAzeri Turkic has mostly replaced Xoini, however in the 1960s, the extent of the dialect was as follows:\n\n\nSome sounds are approximate. Some of the vowels like \"e, â, o, u\" and \"i\" show variations.\n\n<br>\nThe consonants are: \"p, b, t, d, č, j, k, g, x, xʷ, q, f, m, n, r, l, s, z, ž, š, h, v, w, y\".\n\n<br>\nIn Xoini, vowel harmony, gemination and lengthening more or less occurs.\n\nNouns have two cases: direct and oblique. Contrary to the often case in Persian, adjective is not Post-positive. The formation of different kinds of nouns and adjectives and their order are as follows:\n\nThe possessive pronouns are also used with both preposition and postposition, e.g.:\n\nThey are acted as possessive adjectives too:\n\nFor example:\n\nThey serve also as adjectives:\n\nPossession is also expressed by adding suffixes to nouns. These are added after inflection for number. See the \"Person Suffixes\" table below.\n\nReflexive pronoun: \"geg\". But it is treated as a noun in terms of declension, e.g.:\n\nThe verbal system follows the general pattern found in other Tati dialects. It employs:\n\nHowever, the main exceptional characteristics of Xoini are:\n\nThe above suffixes serve as:\n\nThe suffixes may be attached to the verb; the agent of the verb in an ergative construction; an adverb; a prepositional or postpositional phrase; and in a compound verb to its nominal Complement.\n\nThe same set of endings is used for the present and the subjunctive. The endings of the preterit and the present perfect are basically the enclitic present forms of the verb 'to be' (\"*ah-\", here called base one). For pluperfect and subjunctive perfect the freestanding auxiliary verb 'to be' (\"*bav-\", here called base two) is utilized. There is no ending for singular imperative and it is \"-ân\" for plural. For the inflections of \"to be\" see \"Auxiliary inflection\" below.\n\nThe past and present stems are irregular and shaped by historical developments, e.g.: \"uj- / ut-\" (to say); xaraš-/xarat- (to sell); \"taj-/tat-\" (to run). However, in many verbs the past stem is built on the present stem by adding \"-(e)st\"; e.g.: \"brem-\" → \"bremest-\" (to weep).\n\nThe imperative is formed by the modal prefix \"be-\" if the verb contains no preverb, plus the present stem and without ending in the singular and with \"-ân\" in the plural. \"be-\" is often changed to \"bi-, bo- or bu-\" according to the situation, and appears as \"b-\" before a vowel of a verbal stem.\n\nThe conjugation of the verb 'to be' uses two different bases; historically one from the root \"*ah-\" and the other from the root \"*bav-\".\n\nThe present from the root \"*bav-\" is the present of \"to become\" which is from the same root with the addition of the preverb \"â-\" and the imperfective prefix \"(e)m-\", thus: \"â-m-bum, â-m-bin, â-m-buk; â-m-biâm, â-m-biân â-m-bend\" (I become, you become, etc.). So it doesn't mean \"to be\".\n\nThere is another form, \"hest-\" which occurs in the sense of \"to be, to exist\": \"hest-im, hest-iš, hest-e; hest-im, hest-iân, hest-end\".\n\nPrepositions, postpositions and the conjunction \"and\" of Xoini are as follows:\n\nXoini has been impacted by Turkic Azeri to some extent. That includes borrowing a number of verbal forms, for example: \"-miš\" which is attached to the past stem of some verbs to form a verbal noun, e.g., \"ut-miš\" (saying). The postposition, \"-da\" (from) seems to be Turkic. There exist also a number words e.g.: \"düz\" (straight, right).\n\nYarshater, E., 2002. The Xo'ini dialect. Persica, Vol. 18, P. 85-102. \n"}
{"id": "17142206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17142206", "title": "La Santa", "text": "La Santa\n\nLa Santa is a secret society within the \"'Ndrangheta\", a criminal organisation in Calabria (Italy). The name probably derives from the shortening of \"mamma santissima\". In mafia slang, the expression is used to refer to mafia chiefs. \"Mamma santissima\" literally means \"most holy mother\" and refers to the Virgin Mary, who is regarded as the protector of the 'Ndrangheta. \n\nThe Santa was an innovation in the traditional stratification of the 'Ndrangheta introduced in the early 1970s to maximize the power and invisibility of the most important bosses. Security concerns led to the creation of a secret society within the secret society. Membership in the \"Santa\" is only known to other members. Contrary to the 'Ndrangheta code, it allowed bosses to establish close connections with state representatives, even to the extent that some were affiliated with the \"Santa\". These connections were often established through the Freemasonry, which the \"santisti\" – breaking another rule of the traditional code – were allowed to join.\n\nThe rank of \"santista\" was established at the end of the 1960s by Girolamo Piromalli, leader of the Piromalli family in Gioia Tauro, and by the chiefs of several other families. They were eager to modify the traditional rules of the 'Ndrangheta in order to enter the public works market and start illegal activities such as drug trafficking, which were prohibited by the 'Ndrangheta’s traditional code but promised to be very profitable. According to Gaetano Costa (the former boss of the Messina 'ndrina), \"it was Mommo Piromalli who – given the enormous interests which the existed in the Reggio Calabria area (the railroad stump, the steelwork centre, and the port in Gioia Tauro, etc.) – entrusted himself with the rank of \"santista\", in order to assert his higher authority and hence directly control the public works. He said that this rank had been given him directly in Toronto, where there was a very important 'ndrina.\" \n\nIt was precisely on account of these innovations that the new institution was opposed by the more traditionalist bosses, such as Antonio Macrì from the Ionic town of Siderno, the 'Ndrangheta’s charismatic leader of the 1960s, and Domenico Tripodo, who was the dominant figure of the Reggio Calabria clans. Only at the end of the so-called First 'Ndrangheta war, which took place in 1974-76 and led to their deaths and the consequent rise of the De Stefano brothers as the new leaders of the Reggio Calabria 'Ndrangheta, was the new institution fully recognized.\n\nThe \"Santa\" was originally set up as an exclusive body restricted to 33 people. Only when a santista died another member was allowed to enter it. As the years went by, an inflation took place in assigning the status of \"santista\". Around 1978, a new higher rank was established: the \"vangelo\". Later this was followed by the institution of the position of \"trequartino\" (three-quarters) or \"quintino\" (fifth). Finally, the current highest rank of \"associazione\" (society) was established – reserved for the supreme bosses of the 'Ndrangheta.\n\n\n"}

If each rule even properly increases the length, the grammar is called a growing context-sensitive grammar.\n\nChomsky (1963) called a noncontracting grammar a type 1 grammar; in the same work, he called a context-sensitive grammar a \"type 2 grammar\", and he proved that these two are weakly equivalent (context-free grammars were designated \"type 4\" in this work). The type numbering scheme in this 1963 work of Chomsky does not coincide with the earlier one known today as the Chomsky hierarchy because he was trying to emphasize the distinction between weak [generative] and strong [structural] equivalence; in his 1959 work he had used \"type 1 grammar\" to denote a context-sensitive grammar and \"type 2\" for context-free.\n\nThis grammar, with the start symbol \"S\", generates the language \nwhich is not context-free due to the pumping lemma.\n\nA context-sensitive grammar for the same language is shown below.\n\nEvery noncontracting grammar (\"N\", Σ, \"P\", \"S\") can be transformed into a context-sensitive grammar (\"N\"’, Σ, \"P\"’, \"S\") as follows:\n\nFor example, the above noncontracting grammar for { \"a\"\"b\"\"c\" | \"n\" ≥ 1 } leads to the following context-sensitive grammar (with start symbol \"S\") for the same language:\n\nSimilarly, there is an easy procedure for bringing any noncontracting grammar into Kuroda normal form.\nVice versa, every context-sensitive grammar and every Kuroda normal form grammar is trivially also a noncontracting grammar.\nTherefore, noncontracting grammars, grammars in Kuroda normal form, and context-sensitive grammars have the same expressive power.\nTo be precise, the noncontracting grammars describe exactly the context-sensitive languages that do not include the empty string, while the essentially noncontracting grammars describe exactly the set of context-sensitive languages.\n\n\n"}

The basic concept behind People's War is to maintain the support of the population and draw the enemy deep into the countryside (stretching their supply lines) where the population will bleed them dry through a mix of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare. It was used by the Communists against Imperial Japanese Army in World War II and by the Chinese Soviet Republic in the Chinese Civil War.\n\nThe term is used by Maoists for their strategy of long-term armed revolutionary struggle. After the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979, Deng Xiaoping abandoned People's War for \"People's War under Modern Conditions,\" which moved away from reliance on troops over technology. With the adoption of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\", economic reforms fueled military and technological investment. Troop numbers were also reduced and professionalisation encouraged.\n\nThe strategy of people's war was used heavily by the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War. However protracted war should not be confused with the \"foco\" theory employed by Che Guevara and Fidel Castro in the Cuban Revolution of 1959.\n\nIn its original formulation by Mao Zedong, people's war exploits the few advantages that a small revolutionary movement has—broad-based popular support can be one of them—against a state's power with a large, professional, well-equipped and well-funded army. People's war strategically avoids decisive battles, since a tiny force of a few dozen soldiers would easily be routed in an all-out confrontation with the state. Instead, it favours a three-stage strategy of protracted warfare, with carefully chosen battles that can realistically be won.\n\nIn stage one, revolutionary force conducting people's war starts in a remote area with mountainous or otherwise difficult terrain in which its enemy is weak. It attempts to establish a local stronghold known as a revolutionary base area. As it grows in power, it enters stage two, establishes other revolutionary base areas and spreads its influence through the surrounding countryside, where it may become the governing power and gain popular support through such programmes as land reform. Eventually in stage three, the movement has enough strength to encircle and capture small cities, then larger ones, until finally it seizes power in the entire country.\n\nWithin the Chinese Red Army, the concept of people's war was the basis of strategy against the Japanese, and against a hypothetical Soviet invasion of China. The concept of people's war became less important with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the increasing possibility of conflict with the United States over Taiwan. In the 1980s and 1990s the concept of people's war was changed to include more high-technology weaponry.\n\nOutside China, the people's war doctrine has been successful in Cuba, Nepal, and Nicaragua, but generally unsuccessful elsewhere in which the government has the will and the means to break up the movement before it can establish base areas.\n\nOutside China, people's war has been basis of wars started in Peru on May 2, 1982, and in the Nepalese Civil War begun on February 9, 1999. A group of Peruvian Maoists known as the Shining Path at times controlled significant parts of the country during the internal conflict in Peru, but they were dealt a blow by the arrest of their leader Abimael Guzmán in 1992. While they claim to consider this event only a \"bend in the road\", most independent sources have claimed them to be in decline since that time.\n\nBy all accounts, at the height of the conflict in Peru, both the Shining Path and the Peruvian government used terror tactics against the civilian population, especially in the countryside. Government tactics included sponsorship of death squads; Shining Path tactics included violent attacks on trade unionists and others they saw as rivals for the leadership of those opposing the government. This has made it very difficult to get any objective measure of support among the peasantry for either the government or the Maoist insurgents, since such tactics on both sides are liable to intimidate people, but unlikely to win hearts and minds.\n\nIn Nepal, the Maoists succeeded in controlling most of the country and formed 100,000 troops into 3 divisions in what they called the \"beginning of the strategic offensive\". The Nepalese rebels also resorted to conscription, a practice that Mao himself opposed. By aligning with the democracy movement, with the subsequent restoration of democracy, and a peace agreement with the government, the Maoist insurgency met sufficient success to allow the formation of a coalition government in 2008.\n\nIn India, the Naxalite Maoist insurgency controls several rural districts in the eastern and southern regions, especially in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. In the Philippines the Communist Party of the Philippines is waging an enduring people's war through its armed wing, the New People's Army, the Turkish TKP/ML and its armed wing TiKKO (Turkish Workers and Peasants Liberation Army) has been waging a People's War in Turkey since 1972.\n\nDuring the 1980s in Ireland, IRA leader Jim Lynagh devised a Maoist urban guerilla military strategy adapted to Irish conditions aimed at escalating the war against British forces. The plan envisaged the destruction of police and army bases in parts of Northern Ireland in order to create liberated areas under IRA control. In 1984 he started cooperating with Pádraig McKearney who shared his views. The strategy began materializing with the destruction of two Royal Ulster Constabulary barracks in Ballygawley in December 1985 (resulting in the death of two RUC officers), and in The Birches in August 1986. Lynagh and his IRA unit were killed in another attack at Loughgall Police station in an SAS ambush.\n\nConflicts in the following list are labelled the People's War by the Maoists\nIn some other countries, maoists tried or still are trying to start and develop the People's War:\n\n\n"}

Within the convention of the show, the company is a sports governing body which sanctions wrestling matches and gives authority to the championships and is responsible for determining the divisions, rankings, etc. of wrestlers. In truth, the company serves as a touring theatre troupe, as well as event promotion body for its own events.\n\nCurrently, the major wrestling organizations in the United States are World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and Ring of Honor. The major promotion in Canada is Impact Wrestling. The major Mexican lucha libre promotions are Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and AAA. The top Japanese puroresu promotions are New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), and Pro Wrestling Noah. There are also small promotions called indies or territories around the world.\n\nMost promotions are self-contained, organized around one or more championships and do not acknowledge or recognize the legitimacy of other promotions' titles unless they share a working agreement. Others, such as the NWA, act as an umbrella organization which governs titles that are shared among multiple promotions.\n\nMajor promotions have a permanent roster of talent under exclusive contract to them.

{"id": "3077259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3077259", "title": "Purlin", "text": "Purlin\n\nIn architecture, structural engineering or building, a purlin (or historically purline, purloyne, purling, perling) is any longitudinal, horizontal, structural member in a roof except a type of framing with what is called a crown plate. In traditional timber framing there are three basic types of purlin: purlin plate, principal purlin and common purlin.\n\nA \"purlin plate\" in wooden construction is also called an \"arcade plate\" in European English, \"under purlin\", and \"principal purlin\". The term plate means a major, horizontal, supporting timber. Purlin plates are beams which support the mid-span of rafters and are supported by posts. By supporting the rafters they allow longer spans than the rafters alone could span thus allowing a wider building. Purlin plates are very commonly found in large, old barns in North America. A crown plate has similarities to a purlin plate but supports collar beams in the middle of a timber framed building.\n\nPrincipal purlins in wood construction, also called \"major purlin\", \"side purlin\". Principal purlins are supported by principal rafters and support common rafters in what is known as a \"double roof\" (a roof framed with a layer of principal rafters and a layer of common rafters). Principal purlins are further classified by how they connect to the principal rafters: \"Through purlins\" pass over the top; \"butt purlins\" tenon into the sides of the principal rafters; \"clasped purlins,\" of which only one historic U.S. example is known,) are captured by a collar beam. Through purlins are further categorized as trenched, back, or clasped; butt purlins are classified as threaded, tenoned, and/or staggered.\n\nCommon purlins in wood construction, also called a \"major-rafter minor-purlin system\". Common purlins are typically \"trenched through\" the top sides (backs) of principal rafters and carry vertical roof sheathing (The key to identifying this type of roof system). Common purlin roofs in North America are found in areas settled by Englishmen and may have been a new invention in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. No examples of framed buildings with common purlin roofs have been reported in England, however some stone barns in England have vertically boarded, common purlin roofs. Historically, these roofs are found in New England, the highest concentration in Maine, and isolated parts of New York and along the St. Lawrence River in Canada. One of the oldest extant (surviving) examples is in the Coffin House in Newbury, Massachusetts from 1678. The purpose of a common purlin roof may be they allow a board roof, that is a roof of nothing but vertically laid boards with seams covered with battens or another layer of boards.\n\nIn steel construction, the term purlin typically refers to roof framing members that span parallel to the building eave, and support the roof decking or sheeting. The purlins are in turn supported by rafters or walls. Purlins are most commonly used in Metal Building Systems, where Z-shapes are utilized in a manner that allows flexural continuity between spans.\n\nIt is the practice in the steel industry that structural shapes are assigned representative designations for convenient shorthand description on drawings and documentation: Channel sections, with or without flange stiffeners, are usually referenced as C shapes; Channel sections without flange stiffeners are also referenced as U shapes; Point symmetric sections that are shaped similar to the letter Z are referenced as Z shapes. Section designations can be regional and even specific to a manufacturer. In steel building construction, secondary members such as purlins (roof) and girts (wall) are frequently cold-formed steel C, Z or U sections, (or mill rolled) C sections.\n\nCold formed members can be efficient on a weight basis relative to mill rolled sections for secondary member applications. Additionally, Z sections can be nested for transportation bundling and, on the building, lapped at the supports to develop a structurally efficient continuous beam across multiple supports.\n\nInformation on the origin of the term \"purlin\" is scant. The Oxford Dictionary suggests a French origin, with the earliest quote using a variation of \"purlin\" in 1447.\n\nNote: The sketches in this section reference terminology commonly used in the UK and Australia. \n\n"}

This is known as a rake or raked stage and improves the view and sound for the audience.\n\nThe slope of the rake is measured by the number of horizontal units it takes for one vertical unit measured in the direction of the slope, or by the equivalent percentage. A rake of one horizontal unit to one vertical unit (1 in 1) would give an angle of 45° from the horizontal. Rakes of 1 in 18 (5.56%) to 1 in 48 (2.08%) were more common. \n\nConverting the rake ratio to an angle requires the application of some basic trigonometry. The angle in degrees = arctan(vertical/horizontal), where \"vertical\" is the vertical rise in distance and \"horizontal\" is the horizontal distance over which this rise occurs. For example, for a rake of 1:18, the corresponding angle is arctan(1/18) = 3.18°.\n\nTheatres constructed after the beginning of the 20th century feature a raked audience section. This change back to the method of construction seen in Greek and Roman theaters (flat stage and terraced audience) was effected due the difficulty encountered when one tries to walk across a sloped surface, which had resulted in unnatural movement patterns to avoid the appearance of limping caused by the non-level surface.\n\nRaked stages can still be seen in many opera and west end productions, where a temporary raked acting surface is built over a theatre's permanent flat stage. Creating a raked stage can also assist set designs requiring forced perspective.\n\nOn a raked stage an actor who is further from the audience is higher than an actor who is closer to the audience. This led to the theatre positions \"upstage\" and \"downstage\", meaning, respectively, further from or closer to the audience.\n\nThe term \"upstaging\" refers to one actor moving to a more elevated position on the rake (stage), causing the upstaged actor (who stays more downstage, closer to the audience) to turn their back from the audience to address the cast member. The term \"upstaging\" has also since taken on the figurative meaning of an actor unscrupulously drawing the audience's attention away from another actor.\n"}

He appears frequently on Fox News and has given seminars to various law enforcement units in the United States.\n\nSpencer, a self-proclaimed expert on radical Islam, has published a number of books on the subject including two \"New York Times\" bestsellers. In 2003 he founded and has since directed Jihad Watch, a blog which he describes as containing \"news of the international jihad, [and] commentary\" which is dedicated to \"bringing public attention to the role that jihad theology and ideology plays in the modern world, and to correcting popular misconceptions about the role of jihad and religion in modern-day conflicts\".\n\nHe has also co-founded the anti-Muslim group Stop Islamization of America (SIOA) and the Freedom Defense Initiative with blogger Pamela Geller, with whom he also co-authored a book, \"The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on America\".\n\nHis viewpoints have been described as anti-Islamic or Islamophobic, Spencer describes himself as \"the “good” kind of Islamophobe.\" In 2013 the UK Home Office barred Spencer and Geller from travel to the UK for 3 to 5 years for \"making statements that may foster hatred that might lead to inter-community violence\".\n\nSpencer is a member of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, the Eastern Catholic Antiochian Greek Catholic counterpart of the ancient Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. In a 2006 interview, Spencer stated that his grandparents were forced to emigrate from an area that is now part of Turkey because they were Christians. According to a 2010 interview in \"New York\" magazine, Spencer's father worked for the Voice of America during the Cold War, and in his younger days, Spencer himself worked at Revolution Books, a Maoist bookstore in New York City founded by Robert Avakian.\n\nSpencer received an M.A. in 1986 in religious studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His masters thesis was on Catholic history. He has said he has been studying Islamic theology, law, and history since 1980. He worked in think tanks for more than 20 years, and in 2002–2003 was an adjunct fellow with the Free Congress Foundation. Spencer named Paul Weyrich, also a Melkite Catholic, as a mentor of his writings on Islam. Spencer writes, \"Paul Weyrich taught me a great deal, by word and by example – about how to deal both personally and professionally with the slanders and smears that are a daily aspect of this work.\"\n\nSpencer left the Catholic Church in 2016 and became a member of the Greek Orthodox Church.\n\nSpencer does not believe that traditional Islam is \"inherently terroristic\" but says he can prove that \"traditional Islam contains violent and supremacist elements\", and that \"its various schools unanimously teach warfare against and the subjugation of unbelievers\". However, he rejects the notion that all Muslims are necessarily violent people. He has said that among moderate Muslims, \"there are some who are genuinely trying to frame a theory and practice of Islam that will allow for peaceful coexistence with unbelievers as equals.\"\n\nSpencer co-founded Stop Islamization of America (SIOA) and the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) with Pamela Geller in 2010. Both organizations are designated as hate groups by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nIn July 2011, Wired reported that two of Spencer’s books were listed in FBI training materials. Both \"The Truth About Muhammad\" and \"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam\" were recommended for agents hoping to better understand Islam.\n\nOn December 20, 2006, the government of Pakistan announced a ban on Spencer's book, \"The Truth About Muhammad\", citing \"objectionable material\" as the cause.\n\n\"Onward Muslim Soldiers\" was banned in Malaysia on July 12, 2007.\n\nIn 2009, Spencer was asked to participate in an information session about Islam and Muslims designed for ethnic and multicultural librarians entitled \"Perspectives on Islam: Beyond the Stereotyping\", at the 2009 annual meeting of the American Library Association, which was sponsored by the ALA's Ethnic & Multicultural Information Exchange Round Table (EMIERT). After objections were raised by ALA members and the general public, the three other panelists withdrew in protest and the session was ultimately canceled.\n\nDuring Operation Protective Edge, Spencer was accused of spreading an anti-Palestinian misinformation video, originally published by Pamela Geller, by inaccurately claiming a video of an Egyptian die-in protest from Egyptian newspaper El Badil was a video of Hamas faking the number of casualties killed by Israel. Robert Spencer wrote “as Muhammad said, ‘War is deceit.’ And so here is more ‘Palestinian’ victimhood propaganda unmasked. Not that the international media and the world ‘human rights community’ will take any notice. Video thanks to Pamela Geller.” After El Badil had the video removed from Geller's YouTube account due to copyright infringement, El Badil wrote that Spencer and Geller's inability to distinguish a die-in protest from an Islamic funeral either makes them \"incompetent to speak on Islam or they are professional liars.\"\n\nIn an October 2010 news article, an investigative report by \"The Tennessean\" described Spencer as one of several individuals who \"... cash in on spreading hate and fear about Islam.\" Tennessean investigation concluded \"IRS filings from 2008 show that Robert Spencer earned $132,537 from the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and Horowitz pocketed over $400,000 for himself in just one year\".\n\nSpencer was first invited to be a speaker at the Catholic Men’s Conference of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Worcester on March 16, 2013. The Bishop Robert Joseph McManus then decided to rescind the invitation.\n\nOn April 13, 2017, Spencer spoke at the Truman State University despite protests and a petition against him. He was invited by the Young America's Foundation.\n\nOn May 1, 2017, Spencer spoke at the University of Buffalo. There he was shouted down and heckled.\n\nOn May 3, 2017, Spencer spoke at Gettysburg College. 375 alumni urged the college president Janet Morgan Riggs to cancel the speech, but the event went on as planned. Spencer said, \"There is one kind of diversity that is not valued generally in an academic setting and that is intellectual diversity.\"\n\nOn November 14, 2017, Spencer spoke at Stanford University. Many students walked out during the event.\n\nOn June 26, 2013, Spencer and Pamela Geller were banned from entering the UK. They were due to speak at an English Defence League march in Woolwich, south London, where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed. Home Secretary Theresa May informed Spencer and Geller that their presence in the UK would \"not be conducive to the public good\".\n\nA letter from the UK Home Office stated that this decision is based on Spencer's statement that:\n\n\"It [Islam] is a religion or a belief system that mandates warfare against unbelievers for the purpose of establishing a societal model that is absolutely incompatible with Western society ... because of media and general government unwillingness to face the sources of Islamic terrorism these things remain largely unknown.\"\n\nThe decision will stand for between three and five years. The ban followed a concerted campaign by the UK anti-extremism and civil rights organization Hope not Hate, which said it had collected 26,000 signatures for a petition to the Home Secretary. Spencer and Geller contested the ban, but in 2015 the British Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, arguing that \"this was a public order case where the police had advised that significant public disorder and serious violence might ensue from the proposed visit.\"\n\nThe ban was criticised by Douglas Murray. He noted that Islamist hate preachers are still allowed to enter the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6397184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6397184", "title": "Saaroa language", "text": "Saaroa language\n\nSaaroa or Hla’alua is a Southern Tsouic language is spoken by the Saaroa (Hla'alua) people, an indigenous people of Taiwan. It is a Formosan language of the Austronesian family.\n\nThe Saaroa live in the two villages of Taoyuan and Kaochung in Taoyuan District (Taoyuan Township), Kaohsiung City, Taiwan (Zeitoun & Teng 2014).\nWith fewer than 10 native speakers and an ethnic population of 400 people, Saaroa is considered critically endangered. Even among native speakers of the language, they use primarily Mandarin or Bunun in their daily lives. There is no longer an active speech community for Saaroa.\n\nWhen grouped according to grammar, Saaroa is most closely related to the other Formosan language (Tsou) and branches very early from Proto-Formosan language that defines the grouping.\n\nOn lexical and phonographical grounds, Tsou, Kanakanbu, and Saaroa also cluster well to form the Tsouic subgroup; it is likely that the Rukai and the \"Lower Three Villages Rukai\" are also Tsouic languages.\n\nThe Tsouic group used to occupy a fairly large area in the southwestern parts of central Taiwan. Due to the invasion of other communities and contagious diseases, it shrank to the relatively small areas as today.\nThe oral tradition say that the Tsouic group originated in Yushan. About 2,000 years ago, the group split into two, the Northern Tsou and Southern Tsou. Northern Tsou moved down along Nantzuhsien River to the west, while Southern Tsou moved down along Laonung River. The latter split into two, Kanakanabu and Saaroa about 800 years ago.\nIn 1990, Saaroa was nearly extinct. Few children speak the language. The Bunun language is becoming the main language of the Saaroa people, and many of the elders in the community speak Taiwanese Hokkien. The shift to the Bunun language occurred when the Bunun migrated into the area inhabited by the Saaroa people.\n\nSaaroa has heavily borrowed from Mantauran Rukai, since the Saaroa and Rukai peoples are geographically adjacent to each other.\n\nLha’alua has 13 consonants: |p, t, k, ʔ, s, v, ts, m, n, ŋ, r, ɾ, ɬ| and four vowels: |i, ɨ, u, a|. The basic syllable pattern in Saaroa is (C)V, where C stands for consonants and V for vowels or long vowels. Vowels can either appear as long vowels or in clusters. Vowels in clusters make two or more syllables. There are also plenty of loan words in Saaroa, many of which were introduced during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan (1895-1945). Apart from Japanese, words were borrowed from Mandarin Chinese, Taiwanese southern Min, and other aboriginal languages in the neighboring area, e.g. Bunun.\nIn the past, Roman script was employed in the previous writing materials of Saaroa.\n\nUnderived roots carry the basic meaning of words typically consist of more than two syllables, in a (C)V.(C)V.(C)V pattern. \nSaaroa distinguishes primary stress (indicated by ˊ ) and secondary stress (indicated by ˋ). Primary stress is not contrastive, nor is secondary stress. A vowel with primary stress is characterised by higher pitch and greater intensity. Though the stressed syllable is realised with a high pitch, the difference between words does not lie in the positioning or quality of this pitch. Therefore, Saaroa should not be considered a pitch-accent language.\nIn Saaroa, reduplication is a very productive morphological process. Exactly the same morphological process may apply to a dynamic verb and an adjectival element within a predicate. For example, when undergoing reduplication, both adjectival elements and dynamic verbs can have 'progressive', 'continuous', intensification (or 'iteration')', 'diminutive' and 'collectivity' meanings.\n\nIn Saaroa, nouns are subsumed under several grammatical subclasses according to their morphological/syntactic possibilities correlating with semantic properties of their referents (i) common nouns, (ii) kinship terms, (iii) human nouns and nonhuman nouns, (iv) person names, (v) locative nouns and (vi) temporal nouns. These classes may overlap; accordingly, a noun can fall in more than one class. \nSimilarly, verbs are subsumed under several grammatical subclasses according to the morphological/syntactic possibilities correlating with semantic properties of the referents: (i) transitivity classes, (ii) stative verbs, and (iii) adverbial verbs. All the classes may overlap; accordingly, a verb can fall into more than one class.\nIn Saaroa, the functional possibilities of adjectival elements typically include being modifiers to a head noun in an NP and heads of an intransitive predicate.\n\nWhen it comes to word order, Saaroa is basically a predicate-initial language. The irrealis Actor Voice verb muacekehle 'will return' appears before the Subject argument kana'ana '(s)he'. Moreover, the basic word order is Verb-Actor-Theme. For example, the nominative Actor argument of an Actor Voice Construction (e.g., mairange 'sweet potato'). Similalrly, the nominative Theme argument of a Patient Voice construction must follow the genitive Actor argument.\n\n\n"}

Suspension bondage is considered to carry a higher risk than other forms of sexual bondage.\n\nIn \"partial suspension\" the person is bound in a way that part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains. The classic partial suspension position is to have the person balancing on one foot with part of their weight supported through a chest harness and the other leg pulled up in some direction. A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.\n\nIn \"full suspension\" the person is completely supported by suspension ropes, cables or chains, and they have no contact with the ground. The position of the person's body in a full suspension is only limited by their endurance and the skill of the binder.\n\nThe main effect of suspension bondage is to create a heightened sense of vulnerability and inescapability, as the subject is made to feel that by attempting to free themselves they may fall and hurt themselves, thus also creating a form of mental bondage in addition to the physical one that holds them. Being suspended, especially in a large open space, also creates a sense of objectification, submissiveness and erotic helplessness for the subject, which can be erotically stimulating for them and for those observing them. Rope suspension is sometimes done as performance art at BDSM conventions and fetish-themed nightclubs.\n\nSuspension can alternatively create a sense of liberation in that one can \"fly\" around the room, and some styles of rigging are optimal for the suspendee to have control over their spin rate, body position, and general activities. Trance-like states are also common, resulting alternatively or simultaneously from the sensations of 'anti-gravity\", the heightened awareness of one's body, and the sacrifice of one's natural physical strengths.\n\nThe three main suspension positions are vertical, horizontal and inverted.\n\nThis primarily involves the person being lifted from the ground by their wrists. This is usually achieved by use of rope or by special suspension cuffs. When using rope, extreme damage can be caused to the soft tissues of the wrists, as well as reducing circulation, so being suspended by ropes can only normally be achieved for a very short period of time. Often in fiction and movies a person may be pictured hanging from metal cuffs or handcuffs. This is possible, although extremely painful and will leave deep marks in the wrists. The safest and \"most comfortable\" method of suspension by the wrists is to use suspension cuffs as they are specifically designed to spread the weight around the wrist as much as possible.\n\nAn alternative method of vertical suspension is to use a bondage rope harness. With the ropes tied around the body and in particular around the upper arms close to the shoulders as well as around the upper leg and through the groin, it is possible to suspend a person with ropes attached to these areas similar to the way a parachute is attached to a person. In this position the arms and legs may be left to hang free, as the person would have great difficulty getting free without assistance.\n\nThis position has the subject bound in a horizontal position, sometimes face up but usually face down. The body is lifted into this position either by attaching bondage equipment to the wrists and ankles, or to other areas of the body, or a mixture of both, with the subject's weight born by these areas. The ankles or wrists may be brought together or kept apart by a spreader bar. In case of the wrists and ankles ropes or suspension cuffs can be used. When the body itself is used to suspend the person, they may first be tied into a conventional bondage position such as a hogtie or ball tie, then by attaching ropes or chains to ropes under areas of the body able to take weight the person is lifted into the air.\n\nA variation on this position is to secure the wrists to either the spreader bar or to a securing point between their ankles forming a hogtie, resulting in what is called a suspension bow. In this position, if the subject is a female and facing down, her breasts would be pointing almost straight down depending on the strictness of the position, and nipple clamps and weights can be added for painful stimulation. The clamps may alternatively be secured to a point on the floor, limiting the subject's ability to struggle or move at all without causing pain.\n\nBeing suspended upside down can be a very hard position to maintain as a result of the position causing the blood to rush to the head. This means that this position probably cannot be maintained for any length of time and can even lead to the person blacking out. To be suspended in this position, ropes or suspension cuffs are used to lift the person into the air by their ankles.\n\nUnlike when a person is suspended by their wrists, rope suspension around the ankles can be maintained for much longer as the ankle region naturally is able to take far more weight and stress than the wrists. This is especially so if boots are used as the ropes can run around the outside surface of the boot thus protecting the skin from damage. The person may be suspended with their legs together, or held apart either by using a spreader bar or by securing the ankles to two separate locations. With the legs held in this position, the subject may have an increased sense of vulnerability as their genital region would be easily accessible.\n\nThe danger most often associated with suspension bondage, over and above the usual risks inherent in bondage, is falling; whether due to a weak suspension point, faulty equipment or poor technique. Inverted positions are especially hazardous in this regard since a head-first fall of only a few inches can kill or paralyze a person. Less obvious dangers include nerve compression and resulting damage, circulation problems and fainting, and the recently recognized harness hang syndrome. Harness hang syndrome appears to relate to suspension with the legs below the heart, as in the case when someone is suspended in a standing position, with no weight on their legs. Extracting a person safely out of suspension bondage can be difficult if they are unconscious, or if a winch or hoist jams. Suspension tops will often work with spotters who can help get the person down in an emergency.\n\nSuspension bondage is a difficult subject to find information on. \nWhile many famous riggers regularly perform suspensions, they have expressed hesitation in committing such knowledge for dissemination, due to the increased risk of injury to amateurs attempting to imitate without enough prior research or practice. \n\nMost suspension bondage educational material is found on the web, however there are a couple of books available.\nDouglas Kent's Complete Shibari Volume 2: Sky (2010) is a bondage suspension guide companion to his Complete Shibari Volume 1: Land (2010) which focuses on the basic knots and ties of rope bondage.\nGo Arisue's Kinbaku Theory And Practices (2008) is written in Japanese, the extensive color photographs and step by step guide provide an incredible pictorial resource.\n"}
{"id": "40700469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40700469", "title": "Thanksgivukkah", "text": "Thanksgivukkah\n\nThanksgivukkah is a holiday name portmanteau neologism given to the convergence of the American holiday of Thanksgiving and the first day (and second night) of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah on Thursday, November 28, 2013. It was the result of a rare coincidence between the lunisolar Hebrew calendar (whose dates reflect both the moon phase and the time of the solar year, and which can have between 353 and 385 days per year) and the Gregorian calendar. Because the calendars are not calculated the same way, Hanukkah appears at a different time each year on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe term \"Thanksgivukkah\" was trademarked by Dana Gitell, a Boston-area resident who, along with her sister-in-law, Deborah Gitell, created a Facebook page and a Twitter account devoted to the phenomenon and bought the URL. \"Boston Magazine\" reported that the idea was popular all over the U.S.\n\nThere has been some disagreement about the name: the Manischewitz company, the country’s top producer of kosher food, has spelled the dual-holiday with one fewer \"k\" towards the end, as “Thanksgivukah”; and Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\" posed the question: \"Why 'Thanksgivukkah'? Why not 'Chanksgiving?'\". \"Haaretz\" points to a clip from \"The O.C.\", the source of the portmanteau \"Chrismukkah\", as the basis of the \"Thanksgivukkah\" portmanteau.\n\nThanksgiving Day fell during Hanukkah at least twice between 1863 (when Thanksgiving was proclaimed a U.S. federal holiday by President Abraham Lincoln) and 2013: in 1888 Thanksgiving was the first day of Hanukkah, and in 1899 it was the fourth day. The 1888 coincidence of Thanksgiving and Hanukkah attracted some media attention at the time, with the \"New York Herald\" reporting on joint Thanksgiving–Hanukkah services held in \"various synagogues\" and a sermon given by Rabbi Frederick de Sola Mendes.\n\nThanksgiving occurred later in 1888 and 1899 than is possible under current U.S. law: as a result of changes between 1939 and 1941, Thanksgiving is always held on the fourth Thursday in November. The last time the fourth Thursday of November fell within Hanukkah before 2013 was in 1861, before Thanksgiving existed. As a result of this confusion, some media reports have mistakenly claimed that Thanksgivukkah had \"never\" occurred prior to 2013.\n\nBecause the Gregorian and Jewish calendars have slightly different average year lengths, over time they drift out of sync with each other. As a result of this, the first day of Hanukkah will not precede or coincide with Thanksgiving Day again in the foreseeable future. (One physicist has calculated that, if the Jewish calendar is not revised, Thursday, November 28 will not fall during Hanukkah again until the year 79811, once it has drifted all the way around the cycle of the Gregorian calendar and back to November. Many media sources have reported this \"tongue-in-cheek\" calculation as a serious estimate of the date of the next Thanksgivukkah.) However, since the Jewish day does not begin at midnight, but on the sunset before it, there will be two more years in which Hanukkah and Thanksgiving \"partially\" overlap, with the first \"night\" of Hanukkah beginning in the evening of Thanksgiving. These will be the evenings of Thursday, November 27, 2070 and Thursday, November 28, 2165. (The most recent such year was 1918.)\n\nMayor Thomas Menino of Boston said he would proclaim November 28, 2013, “Thanksgivukkah,” saying through a spokeswoman: \"This is a big deal, a once-in-a-lifetime event.” Massachusetts State Representative Louis Kafka and local rabbi David Paskin planned to host a gathering close to Thanksgivukkah, that will include a turkey-shaped menorah to give to fellow representatives to put in the Massachusetts State House. U.S. President Barack Obama gave a speech likening the struggles of the Maccabees to those of the Pilgrims.\n\nMacy's included a giant dreidel in its Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. The Dirty Sock Funtime Band wrote a song, \"Hannukah, O Hannukah (Introducing the Menurkey!)\", and included it in a show in New York City. A rabbi in Mineola, Long Island, granted a pardon to a kosher turkey in honor of Thanksgivukkah.\n\nA Los Angeles-based festival co-produced by Deborah Gitell and singer/songwriter Craig Taubman was held on November 29, 2013, at the Pico Union building, featuring the Moshav Band and hip hop rapper Kosha Dillz. The festival was funded by a campaign on crowdfunding platform Jewcer. The Beth Tfiloh Congregation in Pikesville, Maryland, set off fireworks to celebrate Thanksgivukkah.\n\nPresident Obama recognized Thanksgivukkah at the official White House Hanukkah reception on December 5, singling out Menurkey-creator Asher Weintraub as well as Dana and Deborah Gitell for coining the phrase \"Thanksgivukkah\".\n\nOutside the United States, in London, England, the Saatchi Shul hosted a Thanksgivukka Friday night dinner. In Tel Aviv, Israel, Nefesh B'Nefesh co-hosted a Thanksgivukka Friday night dinner and clothing drive.\n\nThere have been parodies of it, by satirist Stephen Colbert and by satire news program \"Dish Nation\". Comedian Yisrael Campbell starred in a fake movie trailer for a horror movie titled \"Happy Thanksgivukkah\", where a gentile family's thanksgiving dinner is invaded by a large Jewish family celebrating Hannukah.\n\nThere has been opposition to the holiday on the ground that the syncretism trivializes both festivals. An Anti-Thanksgivukkah anthem was featured in \"Heeb Magazine\" and subsequently in \"The Jewish Daily Forward\".\n\nNumerous suggestions were publicly made for combinations of traditional dishes of both holidays. Buzzfeed posted \"How to Celebrate Thanksgivukkah, the Best Holiday of All Time,\" with recipes for Manischewitz-brined turkey with challah apple stuffing and latkes with cranberry applesauce. Others focused on sweet potato latkes, latke-crusted turkey cutlets, stuffing a turkey with challah bread, pecan pie rugelach, turkey doughnuts, pumpkin kugel, sufganiyot filled or topped with a sweet cranberry or apple compote or canned pumpkin, and sweet potato, prune and carrot tzimmes.\n\nLower Manhattan restaurant Kutsher’s Tribeca announced that it would serve a three-course Thanksgivukkah dinner, including sweet potato latkes topped with melted marshmallows. The Manischewitz company launched a multimillion-dollar multimedia campaign in support of the holiday.\n\nChicago chef and 2013 Kosherfest honoree Laura Frankel, Executive Chef at Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership, curated a menu of Thanksgivukkah dishes that included culinary hyrbids like pumpkin-spice latkes and turkey schnitzel with thyme and orange zest.\n\nThanksgivukkah was characterized by products promoted on and sold online. Funds of over $48,000 to produce a turkey-shaped menorah, dubbed a \"menurkey,\" were raised by nine-year-old Asher Weintraub in Manhattan, New York, via a Kickstarter campaign. A crafter in Seattle, Washington, created another Thanksgiving-inspired menorah after she saw a camel menorah and decided she needed a \"Turkorah\". Some suggested that the holiday shopping season would be impacted by the convergence, and that retailers might have earlier holiday promotions. A Thanksgivukkah pop-up store opened in Atlanta, and the Manischewitz company produced a line of products for this day.\n\nWhile the imagery and products surrounding the day were light-hearted, advocates contended it had a broader significance resonant with American democracy. “There are amazing similarities between the Pilgrims’ quest for religious freedom and what the Maccabees were fighting for,” one advocate told the \"New York Daily News\", referring to the Hanukkah story of Judah Maccabee, who led the Hebrews’ fight for freedom from and military victory over the Greeks in the 2nd century BC. “This a great opportunity for Jewish Americans to celebrate this country and for everyone to acknowledge the greatness of our shared religious freedoms.” In 1888, the \"New York Herald\" wrote that \"The two festivals merged well together,\" describing Hanukkah as \"a thanksgiving festival for deliverance from… tyranny\". A \"Thanksgivukkah Manifesto\" has been penned, claiming that it is the ideal holiday for increasingly secular American Jews.\n\nAdditionally, some have claimed that both Hanukkah and Thanksgiving have roots in the Jewish harvest festival of Sukkot.\n\n\"Chrismukkah\" is a portmanteau neologism referring to the merging of the holidays of Christianity's Christmas and Judaism's Hanukkah. The term was popularized by the TV drama \"The O.C.\" Chrismukkah is also celebrated as an ironic, alternative holiday. Similar neologisms such as \"Chrismahanukwanzakah\" and \"HanuKwanzMas\" blend Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa.\nIn \"A Kosher Christmas: 'Tis the Season to Be Jewish\" (Rutgers University Press, 2012), author Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut discusses the phenomenon of hybrid Jewish holidays such as Chrismukkah during the December holiday season in the US, and the Americanization of Hanukkah and the holiday season for Jews.\n\n"}
{"id": "20623119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20623119", "title": "Urban open space", "text": "Urban open space\n\nIn land use planning, urban open space is open space areas for \"parks,\" \"green spaces,\" and other open areas. The landscape of urban open spaces can range from playing fields to highly maintained environments to relatively natural landscapes. Generally considered open to the public, urban open spaces are sometimes privately owned, such as higher education campuses, neighborhood/community parks/gardens, and institutional or corporate grounds. Areas outside city boundaries, such as state and national parks as well as open space in the countryside, are not considered urban open space. Streets, piazzas, plazas and urban squares are not always defined as urban open space in land use planning.\n\nThe term \"urban open space\" can describe many types of open areas. One definition holds that, \"As the counterpart of development, urban open space is a natural and cultural resource, synonymous with neither 'unused land' nor 'park and recreation areas.\" Another is \"Open space is land and/or water area with its surface open to the sky, consciously acquired or publicly regulated to serve conservation and urban shaping function in addition to providing recreational opportunities.\" In almost all instances, the space referred to by the term is, in fact, green space. However, there are examples of urban green space which, though not publicly owned/regulated, are still considered urban open space.\n\nFrom another standpoint public space in general is defined as the meeting or gathering places that exist outside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the public, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and proximity. This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places a focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship.\nThe benefits that urban open space provides to citizens can be broken into three basic forms; recreation, ecology, and aesthetic value. Psychological benefits gained by visitors to urban green spaces increased with their biodiversity, indicating that 'green' alone is not sufficient; the quality of that green is important as well.\n\nUrban open space is often appreciated for the recreational opportunities it provides. Recreation in urban open space may include active recreation (such as organized sports and individual exercise) or passive recreation, which may simply entail being in the open space. Research shows that when open spaces are attractive and accessible, people are more likely to engage in physical activity. Time spent in an urban open space for recreation offers a reprieve from the urban environment and a break from over-stimulation. Studies done on physically active adults middle aged and older show there are amplified benefits when the physical activities are coupled with green space environments. Such coupling leads to decreased levels of stress, lowers the risk for depression as well as increase the frequency of participation in exercise. Casual group walks in a green environment (nature walks) increase one's positive attitude and lower stress levels as well as risk of depression. \n\nThe conservation of nature in an urban environment has direct impact on people for another reason as well. A Toronto civic affairs bulletin entitled \"Urban Open Space: Luxury or Necessity\" makes the claim that \"popular awareness of the balance of nature, of natural processes and of man’s place in and effect on nature – i.e., \"ecological awareness\" – is important. As humans live more and more in man-made surroundings – i.e., cities – he risks harming himself by building and acting in ignorance of natural processes.\" Beyond this man-nature benefit, urban open spaces also serve as islands of nature, promoting biodiversity and providing a home for natural species in environments that are otherwise uninhabitable due to city development.\n\nIn a sense, by having the opportunity to be within a natural urban green space people gain a higher appreciation for the nature around them. As Bill McKibben mentions in his book \"The End of Nature\", people will only truly understand nature if they are immersed within it. He follows in Henry David Thoreau's footsteps when he isolated himself in the Adirondack Mountains in order to get away from society and the overwhelming ideals it carries. Even there he writes how society and human impact follows him as he sees airplanes buzzing overhead or hears the roar of motorboats in the distance.\n\nThe aesthetic value of urban open spaces is self-evident. People enjoy viewing nature, especially when it is otherwise extensively deprived, as is the case in urban environments. Therefore, open space offers the value of \"substituting gray infrastructure.\" One researcher states how attractive neighborhoods contribute to positive attitudes and social norms that encourage walking and community values. Properties near urban open space tend to have a higher value. One study was able to demonstrate that, “a pleasant view can lead to a considerable increase in house price, particularly if the house overlooks water (8–10%) or open space (6–12%).” Certain benefits may be derived from exposure to virtual versions of the natural environment, too. For example, people who were shown pictures of scenic, natural environments had increased brain activity in the region associated with recalling happy memories, compared to people that were shown pictures of urban landscapes. \n\nThe term \"rus in urbe\" meaning \"country in the city\" was used in Rome around the first century C.E. Urban planning in Rome valued the natural landscape and took account for environmental factors. It was thought that by building a city with regard to the local countryside, the people living there would be healthier and happier. English landscapes would later take inspiration from Roman urban planning concepts in their own open spaces.\n\nLondon has a long history of urban open space, which has significantly influenced development of modern parks, and is still among the greenest capital cities in the world.\n\nThe basis for many urban open spaces seen today across Europe and the West began its process of development in London in the 17th and 18th centuries. What would eventually become urban open green space began as paved public plazas. Though they were intended to be open to the public, these spaces began to be re-designated as private parks around the late eighteenth century. It was during this period that the areas became pockets of green in the urban environment, commonly modelled after the natural wild of the countryside.\n\nThe first parks to reverse the trend of privatization and again be opened to the public were England’s royal parks in the nineteenth century. This was done in response to the extensive and unexpected population movement from the country into cities. As a result, \"the need for open space was socially and politically pressing… The problems, to which the provision of parks was expected to offer some relief, were easy to describe: overcrowding, poverty, squalor, ill-health, lack of morals and morale, and so on\". Such sentiments again received significant popular support during the \"City Beautiful\" movement in America during the 1890s and 1900s. Both trends focused on providing the public an opportunity to receive all of the perceived health and lifestyle benefits of having access to open space within urban environments.\n\nSegmentation of urban open spaces was particularly prominent in America during the twentieth century. Since the late 1800's romantic park systems, open space designers have been concerned with guiding, containing or separating urban growth, distributing recreation, and/or producing scenic amenity, mostly within the framework of geometric abstractions.\"\nSuch segmentation was especially prominent in the 1990s, when urban open spaces took a path similar to that of parks, following the modernization trend of segmentation and specialization of areas. As modernity stressed \"increased efficiency, quantifiablity, predictability, and control… In concert with the additional social divisions\" (Young 1995), open spaces grew more specific in purpose. Perhaps this increase in division of social classes’ use of open space, demonstrated by the segmentation of the spaces, displays a situation similar to the privatization of London parks in the eighteenth century, which displayed a desire to make classes more distinct.\n\nToday, places like Scandinavia, which do not have a significant history of outdoor recreation and gathering places, are seeing a proliferation of urban open spaces and adopting a lifestyle supported by the extra urban breathing room. An example of this can be seen in Copenhagen where an area closed to car traffic in 1962 developed, in just a few decades, a culture of public political gatherings and outdoor cafes emerged. Not only is appreciation for and use of urban open spaces flourishing in locations that historically lacked such traditions, the number of urban open spaces is increasing rapidly as well.\n\nUrban open space is under strong pressure. Due to increasing urbanization, combined with a spatial planning policy of densification, more people face the prospect of living in less green residential environments, especially people from low economic strata. This may cause environmental inequality with regard to the distribution of (access) to public green space. A large epidemiological study concluded that wealthier individuals were generally healthier than individuals with a lower income, explained by the pattern that wealthier individuals reside in areas more concentrated with green space. Urban open spaces in higher socioeconomic neighborhoods were also more likely to have trees that provided shade, a water feature (e.g. pond, lake and creek), walking and cycling paths, lighting, signage regarding dog access and signage restricting other activities as well.\n\nA study conducted in Australia provided insight into how there is a correlation between community development/community safety and natural open space within the community. Open areas allow community members to engage in highly social activities and facilitate the expansion of social networks and friendship development. As people become more social they decrease the perceptions of fear and mistrust allowing a sense of community bondage.\n"}

He is also known as Vincas Krėvė, the shortened name he used in the United States.\n\nVincas Mickevičius was born to a family of peasant farmers on October 19, 1882, in the village of Subartonys in Dzūkija ethnographic region of Lithuania. His family was called \"Krėvė\" by the local villagers, name that he later used for his pen name. The customs and traditions of his native district were a constant source of the inspiration for his literary work.\n\nIn 1898, he became a student for the Roman Catholic priesthood at the Vilnius Seminary, but in 1900 he was expelled from the seminary. In 1904, he enrolled the University of Kiev. However, a year later, the university was temporarily closed due to the revolutionary conditions in the Russian Empire, and Krėvė-Mickevičius, unwilling to interrupt his studies, entered the University of Lviv, in Galicia, which was at the time part of the Austrian Empire, and in 1908, he received his doctorate in philology. That same year, the University of Kiev awarded him a gold medal for his thesis on the original home of the Indo-Europeans. In 1913, the University of Kiev awarded him the degree of Master of Comparative Linguistics for his dissertation on the origin of the names \"Buddha\" and \"Pratjekabuddha\".\n\nIn 1909, Krėvė-Mickevičius became a high school teacher in the city of Baku, Azerbaijan. Three years later he assisted in founding the People's University of Baku, and delivered lectures there.\n\nLithuania achieved independence in 1918, and a year later, Krėvė-Mickevičius became Lithuanian Consul in Azerbaijan. In 1920, he returned to Lithuania, and settled in Kaunas, which at the time was the temporary capital.\n\nWhen the University of Lithuania was founded in 1922, Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius became professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures, and remained there as part of the faculty for the following two decades.\n\nHis first attempts on writing came at the age fifteen, at first using Russian and Polish languages; however, after 1902, he wrote in Lithuanian. The first volume of his collected works was published in 1921, at which time he was already a well-known and respected figure, serving as editor of several academic and literary periodicals.\n\nOn 24 June 1940, he was appointed as Prime Minister of Lithuania by acting President Justas Paleckis. He headed the \"People's Government of Lithuania\", which was formed essentially as a rubber stamp for the Soviet takeover of Lithuania. On July 1, 1940 he, together with some other communists, visited Vyacheslav Molotov (prime minister of the USSR) and asked for full annexation of Lithuania into the USSR (this visit was later used as the pretext for that de jure annexation, although occupation and the de facto annexation happened before that). On returning, he offered his resignation, which was not accepted at the time.\n\nAfter the start of the Nazi occupation of Lithuania in 1941, and the closing of higher educational institutions in 1943, Krėvė-Mickevičius went into hiding. Soviet forces reoccupied Lithuania in 1944, at which point he fled the country and settled in a displaced persons camp at Glasenbach, near Salzburg, Austria. There, he taught at the local camp's high school. In 1947, the University of Pennsylvania extended an invitation to join its faculty. There, he served as an Assistant Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures until 1953, when he retired. On July 17, 1954, Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius died in Broomall, Pennsylvania, United States.\n\nHe was considered as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nThe literary production of Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius is wide and varied. It included historical dramas, collections of folklore, short stories and sketches of village life, novels on contemporary problems, and tales based on oriental themes. At his death he was engaged on a major work entitled \"Sons of Heaven and Earth\", which defies classification. It is written partly as drama and partly as a narration; its subjects are biblical with the action taking place in Palestine at the beginning of the Christian era. His work filled with a romantic impulse, drawing attention to rural life and oriental themes, is balanced with realistic narration and description. His writing is characterized by an unusually large vocabulary with remarkable purity. Some scholars sustain that Lithuanian language acquired a range of expression through his works only rivaled by that of Ancient Greece.\n\n\nIn 1997, a museum to Krėvė-Mickevičius was opened in his last residence before emigration in Vilnius, Lithuania. A road in the Dainava district of Kaunas, Lithuania () is also named after him.\n\n"}
