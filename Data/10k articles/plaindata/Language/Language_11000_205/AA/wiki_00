He \"reigned\" in Karlin, near Pinsk, in the government of Minsk (currently in Belarus), in succession to his father and his grandfather, Aaron ben Jacob.\n\nA few years before his death he had a quarrel with a family of Karlin and removed from there to Stolin, a town several miles distant. Considering the amount of business that the yearly influx of strangers brought to the city where he resided, his removal was regarded as a misfortune for Karlin. He died, aged seventy years and seventeen days, in Malinov, near Dubno, in Volhynia, while on a journey to the wedding of his granddaughter, and was succeeded by his son, Asher of Stolin. Asher died in Drohobycz about one year after the death of his father, and was succeeded by his five-year-old son, the so-called Yenuḳa (Baby) of Stolin, against whose rabbinate (in the Ḥasidic sense) Schatzkes — or, according to others, Judah Lob Levin (called Yehallel of Kiev) — under the pseudonym \"Ḥad min Ḥabraya\" (One of the students), wrote a satire in \"Ḥa-Shaḥar\" (vi. 25-44).\n\nAaron is the author of \"Bet Aharon\" (\"Aaron's House\"; Brody, 1875), which contains his cabalistic and ethical expositions of the Pentateuch.

{"id": "1268918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1268918", "title": "Cappadocian Greek", "text": "Cappadocian Greek\n\nCappadocian, also known as Cappadocian Greek or Asia Minor Greek, is a mixed language spoken in Cappadocia (Central Turkey). The language originally diverged from the Medieval Greek of the Byzantine Empire following the Seljuq Turk victory at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. As a result of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s, all Cappadocian Greeks were forced to emigrate to Greece where they were resettled in various locations, primarily to Central and Northern Greece. The Cappadocians rapidly shifted to Standard Modern Greek and their language was thought to be extinct since the 1960s. In June 2005, Mark Janse (Ghent University) and Dimitris Papazachariou (University of Patras) discovered Cappadocians in Central and Northern Greece who could still speak their ancestral language fluently. Many are middle-aged, third-generation speakers who take a very positive attitude towards the language, as opposed to their parents and grandparents. The latter are much less inclined to speak Cappadocian and more often than not switch to Standard Modern Greek.\n\nBy the fifth century AD, the last of the Indo-European native languages of Asia Minor ceased to be spoken, replaced by Koine Greek. At the same time, the communities of central Asia Minor were becoming actively involved in the affairs of the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, and some (now Greek-speaking) Cappadocians, such as Maurice Tiberius (r. 582-602) and Heraclius (r. 610 to 641), would even rise to become Emperors.\n\nCappadocian Greek first began to diverge from the Medieval Greek common language of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire six centuries later, following the Byzantine's defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. This defeat allowed Turkish speakers to enter Asia Minor for the first time, severing Cappadocia from the rest of the Byzantine world. Over the next centuries Cappadocian Greek would be heavily influenced by Turkish, but unlike Standard Modern Greek, it would not be influenced by Venetian and French from the Frankokratia period, which followed the Fourth Crusade's sack of Constantinople in 1204.\n\nThe earliest records of the language are in the macaronic Persian poems of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi (1207-1273), who lived in Iconium (Konya), and some ghazals by his son Sultan Walad. Interpretation of the texts is difficult as they are written in Arabic script, and in Rumi's case without vowel points; Dedes' is the most recent edition and rather more successful than others.\n\nMany Cappadocians shifted to Turkish altogether (written with the Greek alphabet, Karamanlidika). Where Greek was maintained (Sille near Konya, numerous villages near Kayseri, including Misthi, Malakopea, and Anakou and Pharasa town), it became heavily influenced by the surrounding Turkish. However, there are next to no written documents in Medieval or early Modern Cappadocian, as the language was, and still essentially is, a spoken language only. Those educated to read and write, such as priests, would do so in the more classicising literary Greek. The earliest outside studies of spoken Cappadocian date from the 19th century, but are generally not very accurate.\n\nOne of the first documented studies was \"Modern Greek in Asia Minor: A study of dialect of Silly, Cappadocia and Pharasa\" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1916), by Richard MacGillivray Dawkins (1871–1955), the first Bywater and Sotheby Professor of Byzantine and Modern Greek Language and Literature at the University of Oxford, based on fieldwork conducted by the author in Cappadocia in 1909–1911.\n\nAfter the population exchange, several Cappadocian dialects have been described by collaborators of the Center for Asia Minor Studies (Κέντρον Μικρασιατικών Σπουδών) in Athens: Uluağaç (I.I. Kesisoglou, 1951), Aravan (D. Phosteris & I.I. Kesisoglou, 1960), Axo (G. Mavrochalyvidis & I.I. Kesisoglou, 1960) and Anaku (A.P. Costakis, 1964), resulting in a series of grammars (although regrettably not all Cappadocian villages were covered). The Pharasiot priest Theodoridis also published some folk texts.\n\nIn recent years, the study of Cappadocian has seen a revival following the pioneering work on \"Language Contact, Creolization, and Genetic Linguistics\" (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988) by Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman, and a series of publications on various aspects of Cappadocian linguistics by Mark Janse, professor at Roosevelt Academy, who has also contributed a grammatical survey of Cappadocian to a forthcoming handbook on Modern Greek dialects edited by Christos Tzitzilis (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki).\n\nThe recent discovery of Cappadocian speakers by Janse and Papazachariou will result in the release of a new dictionary and a compilation of texts.\n\nCappadocian Greek is well known from the linguistic literature as being one of the first well documented cases of language death, and in particular the significant admixture of non-Indo-European linguistic features into an Indo-European language. This process was pronounced in South-Western Cappadocia, and included the introduction of vowel harmony and verb-final word order.\n\nThe Greek element in Cappadocian is to a large extent Byzantine, e.g. \"θír\" or \"tír\" \"door\" from (Ancient and) Byzantine Greek \"θύρα\" (Modern Greek πόρτα, from Italian), \"píka\" or \"épka\" \"I did\" from Byzantine Greek έποικα (Modern Greek έκανα). Other, pre-Byzantine, archaisms are the use of the possessive adjectives \"mó(n)\", \"só(n)\" etc. from Ancient Greek εμός, σός etc. and the formation of the imperfect by means of the suffix \"-išk-\" from the Ancient Greek (Ionic) iterative suffix \"-(e)sk-\". Turkish influence appears at every level. The Cappadocian sound system includes the Turkish vowels ı, ö, ü, and the Turkish consonants b, d, g, š, ž, tš, dž (although some of these are also found in Greek words as a result of palatalization).\n\nTurkish vowel harmony is found in forms such as \"düšündǘzu\" \"I think\", aor. 3sg \"düšǘntsü\" < \"düšǘntsi\" (Malakopi), from Turkish \"düşünmek\", \"patišáxıs\" < \"patišáxis\" \"king\" (Delmeso), from Turkish \"padişah\". Cappadocian noun morphology is characterized by the emergence of a generalized agglutinative declension and the progressive loss of grammatical gender distinctions, e.g. \"to néka\" \"the (neuter) woman (feminine)\", genitive \"néka-ju\", plural \"nékes\", genitive \"nékez-ju\" (Uluağaç). Another Turkish feature is the morphological marking of definiteness in the accusative case, e.g. \"líkos\" \"wolf (nominative / unmarked indefinite accusative)\" vs. \"líko\" \"wolf (marked definite accusative)\".\n\nAgglutinative forms are also found in the verb system such as the pluperfect \"írta ton\" \"I had come\" (lit. \"I came I was\") (Delmeso) on the model of Turkish \"geldi idi\" (\"geldiydi\"). Although Cappadocian word order is essentially governed by discourse considerations such as topic and focus, there is a tendency towards the Turkish subject–object–verb word order with its typological correlates (suffixation and pre-nominal grammatical modifiers).\n\nThe commonality among all Greek Cappadocian dialects is that they evolved from Byzantine Greek under the influence of Turkish. On the other hand, those dialects evolved in isolated villages. This has resulted in a variety of Greek Cappadocian dialects.\n\nAlthough Cappadocian Greek was once believed to be a dead language, the discovery of a population of speakers has led to an increase in awareness, both within and outside of the Cappadocian community in Greece. In the documentary “Last Words,” which follows Mark Janse through Cappadocian-speaking villages on the Greek mainland, community members are seen encouraging each other to use their dialect for ordinary things, such as joke telling. The members of these villages, including such notable figures as the bishop, recount being touched by a presentation given in Cappadocian by Janse on a visit to the region. The bishop went so far as to say that Janse’s speech “has lifted their shame.” The revitalisation process is seen through examples such as this, wherein the speakers have begun to take back their identity and embrace their mother tongue. Additionally, younger generations are embracing the power of technology to spread awareness, utilising social media about the language to inform the larger Greek population.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29484625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29484625", "title": "Colognian grammar", "text": "Colognian grammar\n\nThe Colognian grammar describes the formal systems of the modern Colognian language used in Cologne currently and during at least the past 150 years. It does not cover the Historic Colognian grammar, although similarities exist.\n\nColognian has verbal conjugation and nominal declension.\n\nThe Colognian declension system marks nouns, pronouns, articles, and adjectives to distinguish gender, case, and number.\nThere are the three grammatical genders called feminine, masculine, and neuter, and a special case most often treated as exceptions of neuter. Like the German declension, the Colognian declension system does not mark grammatical gender for its plural forms; plural can thus be treated similar to another gender in it formalism.\nFive grammatical cases are distinguished: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative.\nGenitive has two variants, either of which can also be described as expressions using dative.\nNumber is either singular or plural in declension.\n\nThe Colognian conjugation system has a few hundred individual types of grammatical conjugations, which mark verbs to distinguish person, number, voice, aspect, tense, mood, modality, etc.\nColognian basic verbs are classified as strong, weak, or irregular.\nIndependently, there are composite verbs, which are classified as either separable or inseparable.\nColognian also has modal verbs and auxiliary verbs, each forming grammatical classes of their own.\nThere are three persons, 1st person, 2nd person, and 3rd person.\nNumber is either singular or plural in conjugations.\nGrammatical voice can be active, passive, or reflexive.\nColognian has indicative and conjunctive moods, and there are also imperative and energetic mood, inferential and renarrative, none of which is completely developed.\nThe aspects of Colognian conjugation include unitary-episodic, continuous, habitual-enduring, and gnomic.\nIn Colognian, grammatical tense can be present tense, preterite tense or past tense, simple perfect or present perfect, past perfect tense, completed past perfect tense, simple future tense, or perfect future tense.\n\nColognian distinguishes the four grammatical cases\nnominative, genitive, dative, and accusative.\nThe genitive has two variants, both of which are compounds or expressions.\n\nColognian is a nominative–accusative language, more precisely a nominative–accusative–dative language.\n\nNominative is the basic form of nouns, etc.\nIt is used to mark the subject or agent in a clause, the verb of which is in the active voice.\nIt marks the subject or patient in a clause, the verb of which is in the passive voice.\n\nThe two variants of the genitive are compounds. They both contain declined forms identical to dative, plus additional elements. Genitives can only be used in conjunction with another noun, to which they refer. One genitive form in standard word order requires that noun to precede the genitive compound, while the other genitive form is required to follow the noun it refers to. Genitives express a stronger or weaker kind of possession, ownership, or belonging-to.\n\n\nThe accusative marks the direct object of a transitive verb in a transitive sentence.\n\nThe accusative is also governed by some prepositions, and by some prepositions in conjunction with specific verb classes, which means that independent of other grammatical contexts, these prepositions make the referenced noun use the accusative form.\n\nThere is a class of adverbial expressions most often telling a time of an action or the place of a movement employing the accusative case. They always have an equivalent expression using a preposition + accusative.\n\nAccusative forms in Colognian grammar are in all instances identical to their corresponding nominative forms. Where needed, potential ambiguities are reduced by prosodic elements of speech, but are extremely rare, since Colognian unlike elsewhere follows a strict subject–predicate–object (SPO) word order for transitive sentences in active and reflexive voices and predicate–subject–object (PSO) for questions. This makes it very distinct from German, where word order is more flexible. Because direct objects cannot occur in the passive voice, the accusative does not occur in passive sentences.\n\n\nIt could be argued that Colognian has a vocative, the forms of which is identical to the nominative with the articles stripped off. Most commonly, this case is seen as a part of the nominative. Since wishes can be expressed using vocative + imperative, this case is applicable to almost any noun and noun expression. Also, few specific verbs can require an object to use the vocative case.\n\n\nThere are three grammatical genders in Colognian: masculine, feminine, and neuter gender. Most nouns have fixed gender, but there is a class of nouns that can switch from predominantly neuter to feminine on certain occasions. Colognian shares this phenomenon with a large group of local and vernacular languages almost along the entire river Rhine. Very few nouns have an unclear gender.\n\nNatural gender plays only a small role in Colognian grammar. While male persons or living beings customarily are referred to with the masculine gender, females are generally referred to using the neuter gender, with some exceptions mentioned below. However, if a person or animal is named or nicknamed with a meaningful Colognian noun, which is not uncommon, the noun’s gender is used to determine articles accompanying the name, but otherwise the person’s natural gender is used.\n\nThere are very few Colognian nouns of unclear grammatical gender, which have therefore been used with varying gender. This may apply to neologisms for some time until a certain gender evolves for them.\n\nThe singular is always used when there is exactly one instance of something or occasionally, depending on the ways such figures are expressed, with magnitudes having a \"one\" at their end, such as 1,001. The plural is used in all other cases, except with zero. Depending on the context and the noun, the singular or the plural is used with zero; sometimes either can be used, but most often, Colognian speakers choose their wording to avoid expressions of the type \"zero + noun.\"\n\nSingular is always used, when there is exactly one instance of something, or occasionally, depending on the ways, such figures are expressed, with magnitudes having a \"one\" at their end, such as 1001.\n\nPlural is used for anything else but zero.\n\nDepending on context and the noun, singular or plural is used with zero instances.\nSome nouns allow only one of them, other nouns allow that either can be chosen arbitrarily.\nYet the actual choice then usually depends on aesthetic aspects of the sentence.\nGenerally, this has little impact since most often Colognian speakers prefer wordings avoiding expressions ususing zero as a count.\n\nColognian conjugation has the voices: active and passive. Also, there is the reflexive which combines middle voice and mediopassive.\n\nThe reflexive is used, when agent and patient of an action are identical. It can be seen as a middle voice which is both active and passive at the same time. There are few reflexive verbs that are used reflexively only. Many verbs, when used in their reflexive form, carry a connotation of self-contention, or of emotional profit for the agent/patient, there the aspect of being formally reflexive can also be seen as benefactive. \nReflexive can also be mediopassive. Since this is predominantly used in generalized speech, semantics diverge from middle voice. Prosody may help to disambiguate. Grammatical forms are identical, however.\n\n\n"}

Intermodal containers are also being converted into construction trailers.\n\nMunicipalities can require the use of construction trailers to be subject to permit proceedings.

{"id": "31268247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31268247", "title": "Dori shoes", "text": "Dori shoes\n\nDori shoes are dance shoes that combine the toe box of a pointe shoe with a dance heel approximately 3 inches ( about 7.5 cm ) in length. These allow the dancer to combine steps from multiple dance styles with classical ballet, by switching balance from standing on the heel to standing en pointe, and vice versa. In 2007, Dorimar Bonilla, a Las Vegas choreographer and dancer originally from Puerto Rico, first created the shoes. They were first used for performance at a cabaret show by \"The Coquettes\" at CatHouse, inside the Luxor Hotel and casino in Las Vegas. They have also been seen in shows such as \"Ran Can Can\" in Puerto Rico, \"Sin City Comedy\" in Las Vegas, and \"Broadway Bares- Las Vegas\", produced by American theater choreographer and director, Jerry Mitchell.\n\nBallet technique is essential to many other dance styles, yet dance shoes made for styles other than ballet make performing ballet moves difficult because they do not include the support to enable dancers to perform classical ballet moves. At the same time, a traditional pointe shoe does not provide the look that most of today’s dances require. Dori shoes attempt to solve this problem and feature the toe box of a pointe shoe alongside a dance heel: this is meant to allow for multi-functional dancing and performing. The shoes are also intended to help dancers to develop a higher level of technique in their performance because dancers are not limited to a specific style. As with traditional pointe shoes, they are intended only for to be used by professional dancers onstage or students training in dance schools, not as a fashion accessory.\n\nDori shoes contain a specially designed sole, to allow the combination of a fully functional pointe shoe's toe box with a dance heel. This sole is flexible so that the dancer can flex or point the feet. The heel is approximately . The exterior is covered with satin and it has a similar look to a traditional pointe shoe. As with traditional pointe shoes, elastic bands and ribbons must be attached to secure the shoe to the feet. The placement of elastic bands and ribbons varies depending on the physique of the dancer. For this reason, they can not be attached in the manufacturing process and instead must be attached by the dancer.\n\n"}
{"id": "2664591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2664591", "title": "Double truck", "text": "Double truck\n\nDouble truck refers to a pair of facing pages, usually in a newspaper or magazine, with content that stretches over both pages.\n\nIn most newspapers and magazines, the booklet-like format is accomplished by folding large sheets of paper in half. This allows the pages to be opened like a book. Sometimes, usually only in magazines, the pages are stapled or stitched at the fold to hold the pages together.\n\nUnder this technique, each sheet of paper is actually four separate pages of the finished product. Two pages appear next to each other on the front of the sheet, with the other two likewise on the reverse side. Each time an additional sheet is added, the publication gains four additional pages. Because of this, most newspapers and publications are printed with page multiples of four.\n\nThis creates a rather confusing arrangement of pages. For example, in a 16 page newspaper, which uses 4 sheets of paper, the pages are arranged as follows:\n\nThese press sheets are known as printers pairs. In printers pairs the two pages that are next to each other should always add up to one more than the total number of pages in the finished product, that is if the first page starts with 1.\n\nNotice how, in this example, the two middle pages, 8 and 9, will appear next to each other on the back of sheet D. This creates a double truck.\n\nOn a typical newspaper page, there is a margin on all four sides, say 1 inch all around. Obviously you don't want print running right against the edge of the paper, but you also don't want print to run into the fold or where the publication might be stapled. However, when the two pages meet in the middle like 8 and 9 in our example, this isn't a concern because both pages appear right next to each other and lie relatively flat.\n\nIn a double truck, the text and images on the pages crosses over the fold. This can create some eye-catching visual effects. For example, newspaper often use a double truck to display large illustrations, graphics, maps or photo collages, often in full color. Often double trucks are saved for special reports or in-depth graphical elements.\n\nIn addition, it is also possible to produce double truck advertisements, which are quite eye-catching as well. Typically advertisers pay a premium price for such ads.\n\nAlthough newspapers are most frequently published with page counts in multiples of four, it is possible to achieve page counts in multiples of two. To do this, a sheet of paper with only one page on each side is added often, but not always, in the center. This sheet, sometimes called a \"dink,\" is half the size of a normal sheet because it doesn't have a mate next to it. Dinks are generally not used in magazines or bound publications because they cannot be held in place.\n\nThe name \"double truck\" comes from the days when the heavy forms for newspaper pages (the metal version of each page), largely filled with lead type, were rolled around the composing room floor on heavy carts called trucks. Two pages for one project meant a double truck.\n"}
{"id": "591699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=591699", "title": "Drag (clothing)", "text": "Drag (clothing)\n\nThe slang term \"drag\" refers to the wearing of clothing of the opposite sex, and may be used as a noun as in the expression \"in drag,\" or as an adjective as in \"drag show\".\nThe use of \"drag\" in this sense appeared in print as early as 1870 but its origin is uncertain. One suggested etymological root is 19th-century theatre slang, from the sensation of long skirts trailing on the floor.\n\nThere is a long history of drag in the performing arts, spanning a wide range of cultural as well as artistic traditions.\n\nDrag in the theatre arts manifests two kinds of phenomenon. One is cross-dressing in the performance, which is part of the social history of theatre. The other is cross-dressing \"within\" the theatrical fiction (i.e. the character is a cross-dresser), which is part of literary history.\n\nDrag is often played for comic effect. Examples include the female characters (at times caricatures) played by male members of Monty Python, and Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in \"Some Like It Hot.\" In other cases the comedy may be primarily in the material being performed, and not necessarily in the fact that the women characters are portrayed by men, such as in many Kids in the Hall sketches.\n\nBaden-Powell, founder of the Scout Movement, was keen on amateur theatricals from Charterhouse public school where, among other roles, he played female operatic roles. In the army he made a speciality of female roles and would often make his own dresses. His stage speciality was what he called his skirt dance.\n\nCross-dressing elements of performance traditions are widespread cultural phenomena. In England, actors in Shakespearean plays, and all Elizabethan theatre, were all male; female parts were played by young men in drag. Shakespeare used the conventions to enrich the gender confusions of \"As You Like It,\" and Ben Jonson manipulated the same conventions in \"Epicœne, or The Silent Woman,\" (1609). The plot device of the film \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) turns upon this Elizabethan convention. During the reign of Charles II the rules were relaxed to allow women to play female roles on the London stage, reflecting the French fashion, and the convention of men routinely playing female roles consequently disappeared. However, in current-day British pantomime, the Pantomime dame is a traditional role played by a man in drag, while the Principal boy, such as Prince Charming or Dick Whittington, is played by a girl.\n\nWithin the dramatic fiction, a double standard historically affected the uses of drag. In male-dominated societies where active roles were reserved to men, a woman might dress as a man under the pressures of her dramatic predicament. In these societies a man's position was above a woman's, causing a rising action that suited itself to tragedy, sentimental melodrama and comedies of manners that involved confused identities. A man dressed as a woman was thought to be a falling action only suited to broad low comedy and burlesque. Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo are an all-male ballet troupe where much of the humor is in seeing male dancers \"en travesti;\" performing roles usually reserved to females, wearing tutus and dancing \"en pointe\" with considerable technical skill.\n\nThese conventions of male-dominated societies were largely unbroken before the 20th century, when rigid gender roles were undermined and began to dissolve. This evolution changed drag in the last decades of the 20th century. Among contemporary drag performers, the theatrical drag queen or street queen may at times be seen less as a \"female impersonator\" per se, but simply as a drag queen, and the role of the queen existing as an identity based in neither mainstream male nor mainstream female conventions. Examples include The Cockettes, Danny La Rue or RuPaul.\n\nMen dressed or disguised as women have featured in traditional customs and rituals for centuries. For example, the characters of some regional variants of the traditional mummers play, which were traditionally always performed by men, include Besom Bet(ty); numerous variations on Bessy or Betsy; Bucksome Nell; Mrs Clagdarse; Dame Dolly; Dame Dorothy; Mrs Finney; Mrs Frail and many others. The variant performed around Plough Monday in Eastern England is known as the Plough Play (also Wooing Play or Bridal Play) and usually involves two female characters, the young \"Lady Bright and Gay\" and \"Old Dame Jane\" and a dispute about a bastard child.\n\nA character called Bessy also accompanied the Plough Jags (aka Plough Jacks, Plough Stots, Plough Bullocks, etc.) even in places where no play was performed: \"she\" was a man dressed in women's clothes, who carried a collecting box for money and other largesse.\n\n\"Maid Marian\" of the Abbots Bromley Horn Dance is played by a man, and the Maid Marians referred to in old documents as having taken part in May Games and other festivals with Morris dancers would most probably also have been men. The \"consort\" of the Castleton Garland King was traditionally a man (until 1956, when a woman took over the role) and was originally simply referred to as \"The Woman\".\n\nIn Baroque opera, where soprano roles for men were sung by castrati, Handel's heroine Bradamante, in the opera \"Alcina,\" disguises herself as a man to save her lover, played by a male soprano; contemporary audiences were not the least confused. In Romantic opera, certain roles of young boys were written for alto and soprano voices and acted by women \"en travestie\" (in English, in \"trouser roles\"). The most familiar trouser role in pre-Romantic opera is Cherubino in Mozart's \"Marriage of Figaro\" (1786). Romantic opera continued the convention: there are trouser roles for women in drag in Rossini's \"Semiramide\" (Arsace), Donizetti's \"Rosamonda d'Inghilterra\" and \"Anna Bolena,\" Berlioz's \"Benvenuto Cellini,\" and even a page in Verdi's \"Don Carlo.\" The convention was beginning to die out with Siebel, the ingenuous youth in Charles Gounod's \"Faust\" (1859) and the gypsy boy Beppe in Mascagni's \"L'Amico Fritz,\" so that Offenbach gave the role of Cupid to a real boy in \"Orphée aux Enfers.\" But Sarah Bernhardt played Hamlet in tights, giving French audiences a glimpse of Leg (the other in fact being a prosthesis) and Prince Orlovsky, who gives the ball in \"Die Fledermaus,\" is a mezzo-soprano, to somewhat androgynous effect. The use of \"travesti\" in Richard Strauss's \"Rosenkavalier\" (1912) is a special case, unusually subtle and evocative of its 18th-century setting, and should be discussed in detail at \"Der Rosenkavalier.\"\n\nThe self-consciously risqué bourgeois high jinks of Brandon Thomas' \"Charley's Aunt\" (London, 1892) were still viable theatre material in \"La Cage aux Folles\" 1978, which was remade, as \"The Birdcage,\" as late as 1996. In the 1890s the slapstick drag traditions of undergraduate productions (notably Hasty Pudding Theatricals at Harvard College, annually since 1891 and at other Ivy League schools like Princeton University's Triangle Club or the University of Pennsylvania's Mask and Wig Club) were permissible fare to the same middle-class American audiences that were scandalized to hear that in New York City, rouged young men in skirts were standing on tables to dance the Can-Can in Bowery dives like The Slide. Drag shows were popular night club entertainment in New York in the 20s, then were forced underground, until the \"Jewel Box Revue\" played Harlem's Apollo Theater in the 1950s: \"49 men and a girl.\" The girl received a roar of applause, when she was revealed as the same smart young man in dinner clothes who had been introducing each of the evening's acts. Drag as a last-resort tactic in situational farce (its only permissible format at the time) made a big Hollywood splash in \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959).\n\nFor the San Francisco drag troupe, The Cockettes (1970–72), who performed with glitter eyeshadow and gilded mustaches and beards, the term \"genderfuck\" was coined. Drag broke out from underground theatre in the persona of Divine in John Waters's \"Pink Flamingos\" (1972): see also Charles Pierce. The crowd surrounding Andy Warhol's Factory scene of the 1960s–1980s also included some drag queens who achieved a certain amount of fame, such as Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn, both immortalized in the Lou Reed song \"Walk on the Wild Side.\" The cult hit movie musical \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" has inspired several generations of young people to attend performances in drag, although many of these fans would deny that they are actually transvestites.\n\nOn American network television, only the broadest slapstick drag tradition was generally represented. Few American TV comedians consistently used drag as a comedy device, among them Milton Berle, Flip Wilson and Martin Lawrence, although drag characters have occasionally been popular on sketch TV shows like \"In Living Color\" (with Jim Carrey's grotesque female bodybuilder) and \"Saturday Night Live\" (with the Gap Girls, among others). On the popular 1960s military sitcom, \"McHale's Navy,\" Ensign Parker (Tim Conway) sometimes had to dress in drag (often with hilarious results) whenever McHale and/or his crew had to disguise themselves in order to carry out their elaborate schemes. \"Gilligan's Island\" occasionally features men dressing in women's clothes, though this was not considered drag since it was not for a performance. The popular Canadian comedy group The Kids in the Hall also used drag in many of their skits. Dame Edna, the drag persona of Australian actor Barry Humphries, is the host of several specials, including \"The Dame Edna Experience.\" Dame Edna also tours internationally, playing to sell-out crowds, and has appeared on TV's \"Ally McBeal.\"\n\nDame Edna represents an anomalous example of the drag concept. Her earliest incarnation was unmistakably a man dressed (badly) as a suburban housewife. Edna's manner and appearance became so feminised and glamorised that even some of her TV show guests appear not to see that the Edna character is played by a man. The furor surrounding Dame Edna's \"advice\" column in \"Vanity Fair\" magazine suggests that one of her harshest critics, actress Salma Hayek, was unaware Dame Edna was a female character played by a man.\n\nOn stage and screen, the actor-playwright-screenwriter-producer Tyler Perry has included his drag character of Madea in some of his most noted productions, such as the stage play \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" and the feature film he based upon it.\n\nMaximilliana and RuPaul co-star together in the TV show \"Nash Bridges\" starring Don Johnson and Cheech Marin during the two-part episode \"'Cuda Grace.\" Maximilliana, looking passable, leads one of the investigators to believe she is \"real\" and sexually advances only to learn there is something extra down there, greatly to his dismay.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, drag has been more common in comedy, on both film and television. Alastair Sim plays the headmistress Miss Millicent Fritton in \"The Belles of St Trinian's\" (1954) and \"Blue Murder at St Trinian's\" (1957). He played the role straight; no direct joke about the actor's true gender is made. However, Miss Fritton is quite non-feminine in her pursuits of betting, drinking and smoking. The gag is that whilst her school sends out girls into a merciless world, it is the world that need beware. Despite this, or perhaps because of Sim's portrayal, subsequent films in the series went on to use actresses in the headmistress role (Dora Bryan and Sheila Hancock respectively). The 21st century re-boot of the series however reverted to drag, with Rupert Everett in the role.\n\nOn television, Benny Hill portrayed several female characters, the Monty Python troupe and The League of Gentlemen often played female parts in their skits. The League of Gentlemen are also credited with the first ever portrayal of \"nude drag,\" where a man playing a female character is shown naked but still with the appropriate female anatomy, like fake breasts and a merkin. Within the conceit of the sketch/film, they are actually women: it is the audience who are in on the joke.\n\nMonty Python women, whom the troupe called pepperpots, are random middle-aged working/lower middle class typically wearing long brown coats that were common in the 1960s. Save for a few characters played by Eric Idle, they looked and sounded very little like actual women with their caricatural outfits and shrill falsettos. However, when a sketch called for a \"real\" woman, the Pythons almost always called on Carol Cleveland. The joke is reversed in the Python film \"Life of Brian\" where \"they\" are pretending to be men, including obviously false beards, so that they can go to the stoning. When someone throws the first stone too early the Pharisee asks \"who threw that,\" and they answer \"she did, she did...\" in high voices. \"Are there any women here today?\" he says, \"No no no\" they say in gruff voices.\n\nIn the 1970s the most familiar drag artist on British television was Danny La Rue. La Rue's act was essentially a music hall one, following on from a much older, and less sexualised tradition of drag. His appearances were often in variety shows such as \"The Good Old Days\" (itself a pastiche of music hall) and \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\". Such was his popularity that he made a film, \"Our Miss Fred\" (1972). Unlike the \"St Trinians\" films, the plot involved a man having to dress as a woman.\n\nKenny Everett dragged up in his TV show as an OTT screen star called Cupid Stunt. Kenny was particularly unconvincing as a woman because he had a beard to which a lot of flesh-tone makeup was applied. However she says \"all in the best possible taste\" as she exposed her knickers as she re-crossed her legs. She is in more of the Dame Edna genre. David Walliams and (especially) Matt Lucas often play female roles in the British television comedy \"Little Britain.\" Walliams also notably plays the part of Emily Howard – a \"rubbish transvestite,\" who makes an unconvincing woman.\n\nIn the UK, non-comedic representations of drag acts are less common, and usually a subsidiary feature of another story. A rare exception is the television play (1968) and film (1973), \"The Best Pair of Legs in the Business\". In the film version Reg Varney plays a holiday camp comedian and drag artist whose marriage is failing.\n\nThe world of popular music has a venerable history of drag. Marlene Dietrich was a popular actress and singer who sometimes performed dressed as a man, such as in the films \"Blue Angel\" and \"Morocco.\" In the glam rock era many male performers (such as David Bowie and The New York Dolls) donned partial or full drag. This tradition waned somewhat in the late 1970s but was revived in the new wave era of the 1980s, as pop singers Boy George (of Culture Club), Pete Burns (of Dead or Alive), and Philip Oakey (of The Human League), frequently appeared in a sort of semi-drag, while female musicians of the era dabbled in their own form of androgyny, with performers like Annie Lennox, Phranc and The Bloods sometimes performing as drag kings. The male grunge musicians of the 1990s sometimes performed wearing deliberately ugly drag – that is, wearing dresses but making no attempt to look feminine, not wearing makeup and often not even shaving their beards. (Nirvana did this several times, notably in the In Bloom video.) However, possibly the most famous drag artist in music in the 1990s was RuPaul. In Japan there are several musicians in the visual kei scene, such as Mana (Moi dix Mois and Malice Mizer), Kaya (Schwarz Stein), Hizaki and Jasmine You (both Versailles), who always or usually appear in full or semi-drag. Maximilliana worked with RuPual in the \"Nash Bridges\" episode \"Cuda Grace\" and was a regular at the now defunct Queen Mary Show Lounge in Studio City, California until the very end. Max (short for Maximilliana) is most well known for her performance as Charlie/Claire in \".\" Max has also appeared in other movies including \"Shoot or Be Shot\" and \"10 Attitudes\" as well as on television shows including \"Nash Bridges\" as mentioned above, \"Clueless,\" \"Gilmore Girls,\" \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"Mas Vale Tarde with Alex Cambert,\" \"MadTV,\" \"The Tyra Banks Show,\" \"The Tom Joyner Show,\" \"America's Got Talent,\" and many others. As of November 11, 2011, Maximilliana had released her first album of all original, fun, dance music for the LGBT community and made it available on iTunes, Amazon.com and CdBaby.\n\nIn gay slang, a \"queen\" is an effeminate gay man, or a gay man with a specialized quality. Along with \"drag,\" the term \"drag queen\" has entered the general lexicon.\n\nDrag queens (first use in print, 1941) are stereotypically viewed to be gay men that dress in drag, either as part of a performance or for personal fulfillment. Though a good portion who wear women's clothing are cisgender men, the term drag queen distinguishes them from transvestites, transsexuals or transgender people. Doing drag here often includes wearing dramatically heavy makeup, wigs and prosthetic devices as part of the costume.\nFemales are called drag kings; however, \"drag king\" also has a much wider range of meanings. It is currently most often used to describe entertainment (singing or lip-synching) in which there is no necessarily firm correlation between a performer's deliberately macho onstage persona and offstage gender identity or sexual orientation, just as cis males who do female drag for the stage may or may not identify as being either gay or female in personal identity. A Faux Queen, Biological Queen (Bio Queen), or Female-bodied Queen is usually a person identifying as female performing in the same light as traditional drag, such as exaggerated hair, makeup, and musical performances.\n\n"}

{"id": "604771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=604771", "title": "Ergative–absolutive language", "text": "Ergative–absolutive language\n\nErgative–absolutive languages, or ergative languages are languages that share a certain distinctive pattern relating to the subjects (technically, arguments) of verbs. Examples are Basque, Georgian, Mayan, Tibetan and several Indo-European languages, such as the Kurdish languages including Gorani. \n\nIn an ergative language, the single argument (\"subject\") of an intransitive verb behaves like the object of a transitive verb, and differently from the agent of a transitive verb.\n\nThat is in contrast to nominative–accusative languages, such as English and most other Indo-European languages, where the single argument of an intransitive verb (\"She\" in the sentence \"She walks.\") behaves grammatically like the agent of a transitive verb (\"She\" in the sentence \"She finds it.\") but differently from the object of a transitive verb (\"him\" in the sentence \"She likes him.\").\n\nIn ergative–absolutive languages with grammatical case, the case used for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb is the absolutive, and the case used for the agent of a transitive verb is the ergative. In nominative–accusative languages, the case for the single argument of an intransitive verb and the agent of a transitive verb is the nominative while the case for the direct object of a transitive verb is the accusative. \n\nThere is a variant group, the ergative-accusative languages (such as Dyirbal), which function ergatively with respect to nouns but are nominative-accusative with pronouns.\n\nAn ergative language maintains a syntactic or morphological equivalence (such as the same word order or grammatical case) for the object of a transitive verb and the single core argument of an intransitive verb, while treating the agent of a transitive verb differently.\n\nThis contrasts with nominative–accusative languages such as English, where the single argument of an intransitive verb and the agent of a transitive verb (both called the subject) are treated alike and kept distinct from the object of a transitive verb.\n\nThese different arguments are usually symbolized as follows:\n\nThe relationship between ergative and accusative systems can be schematically represented as the following:\n\n\"See morphosyntactic alignment for a more technical explanation and a comparison with nominative–accusative languages.\"\n\nNote that the word \"subject\", as it is typically defined in grammars of nominative–accusative languages, has a different application when referring to ergative–absolutive languages, or when discussing morphosyntactic alignment in general.\n\nErgative languages tend to be either verb-final or verb-initial; there are few, if any, ergative SVO-languages.\n\nErgativity can be found in both morphological and syntactic behavior.\n\nIf the language has morphological case, then the verb arguments are marked thus:\n\nIf there is no case marking, ergativity can be marked through other means, such as in verbal morphology. For instance, Abkhaz and most Mayan languages have no morphological ergative case, but they have a verbal agreement structure that is ergative. In languages with ergative–absolutive agreement systems, the absolutive form is usually the most unmarked form of a word (exceptions include Nias and Tlapanec).\n\nThe following examples from Basque demonstrate an ergative–absolutive case marking system:\n\nHere \"-Ø\" represents a zero morpheme, as the absolutive case is unmarked in Basque. The forms for the ergative are \"-k\" after a vowel, and \"-ek\" after a consonant. It is a further rule in Basque grammar that in most cases a noun phrase must be closed by a determiner. The default determiner (commonly called the article, which is suffixed to common nouns and usually translatable by \"the\" in English) is \"-a\" in the singular and \"-ak\" in the plural, the plural being marked only on the determiner and never the noun. For common nouns, this default determiner is fused with the ergative case marker. Thus one obtains the following forms for \"gizon\" (\"man\" in English): gizon-a (man-the.sing.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.pl.abs), gizon-ak (man-the.sing.erg), gizon-ek (man-the.pl.erg). Note that when fused with the article, the absolutive plural is homophonous with the ergative singular. See Basque grammar for details.\n\nIn contrast, Japanese is a nominative–accusative language:\n\nIn this language, the argument of the intransitive and agent of the transitive sentence are marked with the same nominative case particle \"ga\", while the object of the transitive sentence is marked with the accusative case o.\n\nIf one sets: A = agent of a transitive verb; S = argument of an intransitive verb; O = object of a transitive verb, then we can contrast normal nominative–accusative English with a hypothetical ergative English:\n\nAccusative English:\n\nHypothetical ergative English:\n\nA number of languages have both ergative and accusative morphology. A typical example is a language that has nominative–accusative marking on verbs and ergative–absolutive case marking on nouns.\n\nGeorgian also has an ergative alignment, but the agent is only marked with the ergative case in the perfective aspect (also known as the \"aorist screeve\"). Compare:\n\n\"K'ac'-\" is the root of the word \"man\". In the first sentence (present continuous tense) the agent is in the nominative case \"(k'ac'i).\" In the second sentence, which shows ergative alignment, the root is marked with the ergative suffix \"-ma\".\n\nHowever, there are some intransitive verbs in Georgian that behave like transitive verbs, and therefore employ the ergative case in the past tense. Consider:\n\nAlthough the verb \"sneeze\" is clearly intransitive, it is conjugated like a transitive verb. In Georgian there are a few verbs like these, and there has not been a clear-cut explanation as to why these verbs have evolved this way. One explanation is that verbs such as \"sneeze\" used to have a direct object (the object being \"nose\" in the case of \"sneeze\") and over time lost these objects, yet kept their transitive behavior.\n\nErgativity may be manifested through syntax, such as saying “Arrived I” for “I arrived”, in addition to morphology. Syntactic ergativity is quite rare, and while all languages that exhibit it also feature morphological ergativity, few morphologically ergative languages have ergative syntax. As with morphology, syntactic ergativity can be placed on a continuum, whereby certain syntactic operations may pattern accusatively and others ergatively. The degree of syntactic ergativity is then dependent on the number of syntactic operations that treat the subject like the object. Syntactic ergativity is also referred to as inter-clausal ergativity, as it typically appears in the relation of two clauses.\n\nSyntactic ergativity may appear in:\n\nExample of syntactic ergativity in the \"conjunction reduction\" construction (coordinated clauses) in Dyirbal in contrast with English conjunction reduction. (The subscript (i) indicates coreference.)\n\nEnglish (SVO word order):\n\nDyirbal (OSV word order):\n\nThe term \"ergative–absolutive\" is considered unsatisfactory by some, since there are very few languages without any patterns that exhibit nominative–accusative alignment. Instead they posit that one should only speak of \"ergative–absolutive systems\", which languages employ to different degrees.\n\nMany languages classified as ergative in fact show split ergativity, whereby syntactic and/or morphological ergative patterns are conditioned by the grammatical context, typically person or the tense/aspect of the verb. Basque is unusual in having an almost fully ergative system in case-marking and verbal agreement, though it shows thoroughly nominative–accusative syntactic alignment.\n\nIn Urdu and Hindi, the ergative case is marked on agents in the preterite and perfect tenses for transitive and ditransitive verbs, while in other situations agents appear in the nominative case.\n\nIn the Northern Kurdish language Kurmanji, the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs of transitive verbs in past tenses, for the events actually occurred in the past. Present, future and \"future in the past\" tenses show no ergative mark neither for agents nor the verbs. For example:\n\nbut:\n\nIn sentences (1) to (4), there is no ergativity (transitive and intransitive verbs alike). In sentences (6) and (8), the ergative case is marked on agents and verbs. \n\nIn Dyirbal, pronouns are morphologically nominative–accusative when the agent is first or second person, but ergative when the agent is a third person.\n\nMany languages with ergative marking display what is known as \"optional ergativity\", where the ergative marking is not always expressed in all situations. McGregor (2010) gives a range of contexts when we often see optional ergativity, and argues that the choice is often not truly \"optional\" but is affected by semantics and pragmatics. Note that unlike split ergativity, which occurs regularly but in limited locations, optional ergativity can occur in a range of environments, but may not be used in a way that appears regular or consistent.\n\nOptional ergativity may be motivated by:\n\nLanguages from Australia, New Guinea and Tibet have been shown to have optional ergativity.\n\nPrototypical ergative languages are, for the most part, restricted to specific regions of world: the Mesopotamia (Kurdish), Caucasus, the Americas, the Tibetan Plateau, and Australia and parts of New Guinea.\n\nSome specific languages are the following:\n\nAmericas\n\nAfrica\n\nAsia\n\nAustralian\nCertain Australian Aboriginal languages (e.g., Wangkumara) possess an intransitive case and an accusative case along with an ergative case, and lack an absolutive case; such languages are called ergative–accusative languages or tripartite languages.\n\nPapua\n\n\nEurope\n\nNear East (Caucasus and Mesopotamia)\n\nSign languages −− (for example, Nepali Sign Language) should also generally be considered ergative in the patterning of actant incorporation in verbs. In sign languages that have been studied, classifier handshapes are incorporated into verbs, indicating the subject of intransitive verbs when incorporated, and the object of transitive verbs. (If we follow the \"Semantic Phonology\" model proposed by William Stokoe (1991) this ergative-absolutive patterning also works at the level of the lexicon: thus in Nepali Sign Language the sign for TEA has the motion for the verb DRINK with a manual alphabet handshape च /ca/ (standing for the first letter of the Nepali word TEA चिया /chiya:/) being incorporated as the object.)\n\nMany other languages have limited ergativity. In both Pashto and Hindi (Indo-Iranian), ergative behavior occurs only in the preterite and perfect tenses, and in the Georgian, ergativity only occurs in the perfective.\n\nThe Philippine languages (e.g., Tagalog) are sometimes considered ergative (Schachter 1976, 1977; Kroeger 1993), however they have also been considered to have their own unique morphosyntactic alignment. See Austronesian alignment.\n\nSeveral scholars have hypothesized that Proto-Indo-European was an ergative language. However, this hypothesis is disputed.\n\nEnglish has derivational morphology that parallels ergativity in that it operates on intransitive verbs and objects of transitive verbs. With certain intransitive verbs, adding the suffix \"-ee\" to the verb produces a label for the person performing the action:\n\nHowever, with a transitive verb, adding \"-ee\" does not produce a label for the person doing the action. Instead, it gives us a label for the person to whom the action is done:\n\nEtymologically, the sense in which \"-ee\" denotes the object of a transitive verb is the original one, arising from French past participles in \"-é\". This is still the prevalent sense in British English: the intransitive uses are all 19th-century American coinages and all except \"escapee\" are still marked as \"chiefly U.S.\" by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\n\nEnglish also has a number of so-called ergative verbs, where the object of the verb when transitive is equivalent to the subject of the verb when intransitive.\n\nWhen English nominalizes a clause, the underlying subject of an intransitive verb and the underlying object of a transitive verb are both marked with the possessive case or with the preposition \"of\" (the choice depends on the type and length of the noun: pronouns and short nouns are typically marked with the possessive, while long and complex NPs are marked with \"of\"). The underlying subject of a transitive is marked differently (typically with \"by\" as in a passive construction):\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13738459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13738459", "title": "Imitation of sounds in shamanism", "text": "Imitation of sounds in shamanism\n\nShamanism in various cultures shows great diversity. In some cultures, shamanic music may intentionally mimic natural sounds, sometimes with onomatopoiea. \nImitation of natural sounds may also serve other functions not necessarily related to shamanism, such as luring in the hunt; and entertainment (katajjaqs of Inuit).\n\nThis holds e. g. for shamanism among Sami groups. Some of their shamanistic beliefs and practice shared important features with those of some Siberian cultures. Some of their yoiks were sung on shamanistic rites, this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story). Recently, yoiks are sung in two different styles, one of these are sung only by young people. But the traditional one may be the other, the “mumbling” style, resembling to magic spells.\n\nSeveral surprising characteristics of yoiks can be explained by comparing the music ideals, as observed in yoiks and contrasted to music ideals of other cultures. Some yoiks intend to mimic natural sounds. This can be contrasted to bel canto, which intends to exploit human speech organs on the highest level to achieve an almost “superhuman” sound.\n\nShamanism in Siberia is far from being homogeneous. In some of the various cultures there, mimicking natural sounds can be present: some instances of overtone singing, and also certain shamanic songs of some cultures can be examples.\n\nThe seance of Nganasan shamans were accompanied by women imitating the sounds of the reindeer calf, (thought to provide fertility for those women). In 1931, A. Popov observed the Nganasan shaman Dyukhade Kosterkin imitating the sound of polar bear: the shaman was believed to have transformed into a polar bear.\n\nA Russian traveler described a Khanty shamanic séance: it took place in the birch bark tent in full darkness. Only the song and the dombra music of the shaman could be heard: he invoked his spirits. It was mimicked as if the direction of the sound were moving: it sounded as if the shaman had flown around in the tent and left. Later, the voices of various animals (cuckoo, owl, hoopoe, duck, squirrel) could be heard. Then it was imitated as if the shaman had flown back into the tent, singing his song.\n\nAmong several peoples near the Altai Mountains, the new drum of a shaman must go through a special ritual. This is regarded as “making the drum alive”: the tree and the deer who gave their wood and skin for the new drum narrate their whole lives and promise to the shaman that they will serve him. The ritual itself is a libation: beer is poured onto the skin and wood of the drum, and these materials “come to life” and speak with the voice of the shaman in the name of the tree and the deer. Among the Tubalar, this means literally the imitation of the behavior and the voice of the animal by the shaman.\n\nIn a Soyot shamanic song, sounds of bird and wolf are imitated to represent helping spirits of the shaman.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "782895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=782895", "title": "Interculturalism", "text": "Interculturalism\n\nInterculturalism refers to support for cross-cultural dialogue and challenging self-segregation tendencies within cultures. Interculturalism involves moving beyond mere passive acceptance of a multicultural fact of multiple cultures effectively existing in a society and instead promotes dialogue and interaction between cultures.\n\nInterculturalism has arisen in response to criticisms of existing policies of multiculturalism, such as criticisms that such policies had failed to create inclusion of different cultures within society, but instead have divided society by legitimizing segregated separate communities that have isolated themselves and accentuated their specificity. It is based on the recognition of both differences and similarities between cultures. It has addressed the risk of the creation of absolute relativism within postmodernity and in multiculturalism.\n\nPhilosopher Martha Nussbaum in her work \"Cultivating Humanity\", describes interculturalism as involving \"the recognition of common human needs across cultures and of dissonance and critical dialogue within cultures\" and that interculturalists \"reject the claim of identity politics that only members of a particular group have the ability to understand the perspective of that group\". Ali Rattansi, in his book \"Multiculturalism: A Very Short Introduction\" (2011) argues that Interculturalism offers a more fruitful way than conventional multiculturalism for different ethnic groups to co-exist in an atmosphere that encourages both better inter-ethnic understanding and civility; he provides useful examples of how interculturalist projects in the UK have shown in practice a constructive way forward for promoting multi-ethnic civility. Based on a considerable body of research, he also sets out the outlines of a new interpretation of global history which shows that concepts of tolerance are not restricted to the West, and that what is usually regarded as a unique Western cultural achievement should more appropriately be regarded as a Eurasian achievement. He thus offers a more interculturalist view of global history which undermines notions of 'a clash of civilisations'.\n\nInterculturalism has both supporters and opponents amongst people who endorse multiculturalism. Gerald Delanty views interculturalism as capable of incorporating multiculturalism within it. In contrast, Nussbaum views interculturalism as distinct from multiculturalism and notes that several humanities professors have preferred interculturalism over multiculturalism because they view multiculturalism as being \"associated with relativism and identity politics\".\n\nThe United Nations' agency UNESCO adopted the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions in 2005 that declares support for interculturality. In Germany, all universities are required to have a section on intercultural competence in their social work programs, that involves students being able to be open to listen and communicate with people of different cultural backgrounds, have knowledge of the backgrounds of cultural groups, knowledge of existing stereotypes and prejudices involving cultural groups, and other criteria. Salman Cheema, the Head of Marketing and Communications of the British Council, in an article titled \"From Multiculturalism to Interculturalism – A British perspective\", spoke of an event co-hosted by the British Council and Canada's Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on April 11, 2013, interculturalist advocate Phil Wood declared that multiculturalism has faced serious problems that need to be resolved through interculturalism, and rejected those opponents of multiculturalism who seek to restore a pre-multiculturalist monoculturalist society. Several days later in Montreal, the New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP) declared support for interculturalism in the preamble of its constitution adopted its federal convention held in Montreal on April 14, 2013.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3331706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3331706", "title": "Logical form", "text": "Logical form\n\nIn philosophy and mathematics, a logical form of a syntactic expression is a precisely-specified semantic version of that expression in a formal system. Informally, the logical form attempts to formalize a possibly ambiguous statement into a statement with a precise, unambiguous logical interpretation with respect to a formal system. In an ideal formal language, the meaning of a logical form can be determined unambiguously from syntax alone. Logical forms are semantic, not syntactic constructs; therefore, there may be more than one string that represents the same logical form in a given language.\n\nThe logical form of an argument is called the argument form or \"test form\" of the argument.\n\nThe importance of the concept of form to logic was already recognized in ancient times. Aristotle, in the Prior Analytics, was probably the first to employ variable letters to represent valid inferences. Therefore, Łukasiewicz claims that the introduction of variables was 'one of Aristotle's greatest inventions'.\n\nAccording to the followers of Aristotle like Ammonius, only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, and not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms \"man\", \"mortal\", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders 'A', 'B', 'C', which were called the 'matter' (Greek \"hyle\", Latin \"materia\") of the argument.\n\nThe term \"logical form\" itself was introduced by Bertrand Russell in 1914, in the context of his program to formalize natural language and reasoning, which he called philosophical logic. Russell wrote: \"Some kind of knowledge of logical forms, though with most people it is not explicit, is involved in all understanding of discourse. It is the business of philosophical logic to extract this knowledge from its concrete integuments, and to render it explicit and pure.\"\nTo demonstrate the important notion of the \"form\" of an argument, substitute letters for similar items throughout the sentences in the original argument.\n\nAll we have done in the \"Argument form\" is to put 'H' for 'human' and 'humans', 'M' for 'mortal', and 'S' for 'Socrates'; what results is the \"form\" of the original argument. Moreover, each individual sentence of the \"Argument form\" is the \"sentence form\" of its respective sentence in the original argument.\n\nAttention is given to argument and sentence form, because \"form is what makes an argument valid or cogent\". All logical form arguments are either inductive or deductive. Inductive logical forms include inductive generalization, statistical arguments, causal argument, and arguments from analogy. Common deductive argument forms are hypothetical syllogism, categorical syllogism, argument by definition, argument based on mathematics, argument from definition. The most reliable forms of logic are modus ponens, modus tollens, and chain arguments because if the premises of the argument are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows. Two invalid argument forms are affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent. \n\n\n\nA logical argument, seen as an ordered set of sentences, has a logical form that derives from the form of its constituent sentences; the logical form of an argument is sometimes called argument form. Some authors only define logical form with respect to whole arguments, as the schemata or inferential structure of the argument. In argumentation theory or informal logic, an argument form is sometimes seen as a broader notion than the logical form.\n\nIt consists of stripping out all spurious grammatical features from the sentence (such as gender, and passive forms), and replacing all the expressions specific to \"the subject matter\" of the argument by schematic variables. Thus, for example, the expression 'all A's are B's' shows the logical form which is common to the sentences 'all men are mortals', 'all cats are carnivores', 'all Greeks are philosophers' and so on.\n\nThe fundamental difference between modern formal logic and traditional, or Aristotelian logic, lies in their differing analysis of the logical form of the sentences they treat: \n\nThe more complex modern view comes with more power. On the modern view, the fundamental form of a simple sentence is given by a recursive schema, like natural language and involving logical connectives, which are joined by juxtaposition to other sentences, which in turn may have logical structure. Medieval logicians recognized the problem of multiple generality, where Aristotelian logic is unable to satisfactorily render such sentences as \"Some guys have all the luck\", because both quantities \"all\" and \"some\" may be relevant in an inference, but the fixed scheme that Aristotle used allows only one to govern the inference. Just as linguists recognize recursive structure in natural languages, it appears that logic needs recursive structure.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1137435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1137435", "title": "Natural kind", "text": "Natural kind\n\nIn analytic philosophy, the term natural kind identifies a grouping of singular objects that always share particular qualities, whether or not humans know either the objects or the qualities. A natural kind labels a \"real\" structure in the natural world, not an artificial result of human reasoning, by which scholars try to explain common sense knowledge with scientific knowledge.\n\nThose who believe in natural kinds debate their structure and how it can be known. The structure of kinds is assumed to be stable despite worldly experience of constant flux. According to tradition, natural kinds can be known in two forms: as knowledge of general ideas about kinds, acquired by deductive reasoning, and as knowledge of observable examples of kinds, known by inductive reasoning.\n\nResults of deductive and inductive reasoning are stated in propositions that express relations among objects and their qualities. For example: \"All water is formula_1.\" \"All men are mortal.\" \"All crows are black.\"\n\nBelievers in natural kinds claim such propositions describe objects and related qualities that exist. But they recognize that inductive propositions about \"all\" of a kind are problematic, because no-one can observe \"all\" of anything. Drawing conclusions about all members of a kind after observing a small sample appears illogical. But this kind of reasoning appears to be necessary, and often \"works,\" meaning proves to be able to identify stable kinds.\n\nScientific disciplines frequently divide the particulars they study into \"kinds\" and theorize about those kinds. To say that a kind is \"natural\" is to say that it corresponds to a grouping that reflects the structure of the natural world rather than the interests and actions of human beings. We tend to assume that science is often successful in revealing these kinds; it is a corollary of scientific realism that when all goes well the classifications and taxonomies employed by science correspond to the real kinds in nature. The existence of these real and independent kinds of things is held to justify our scientific inferences and practices.\n\nThis article identifies some contentious issues surrounding natural kinds. It presents a minority view expressed by John Dewey that natural kinds are a false conclusion of contaminated instrumental reasoning. It presents several majority views expressed by four more recent scholars—W. V. O. Quine, Hilary Kornblith, Hasok Chang, and Rasmus Winther—that natural kinds are real and important scientific facts.\n\nIn 1938, John Dewey published \"Logic: The Theory of Inquiry.\" He there explained how modern scientists practice induction and deduction, and why they have no use for natural kinds.\n\nThe philosophical issue is how humans can infer one kind of thing from another. The traditional answer grew out of Aristotle's assertion that humans describe entities they know in two kinds of propositions. Existential kinds known by observation are stated in \"generic\" propositions. Conceptual kinds known by reasoning are stated in \"universal\" propositions.\n\nDewey argued that modern scientists do not follow Aristotle in treating inductive and deductive propositions as facts already known about nature's stable structure. They treat propositions as intermediate steps in inquiry, hypotheses about processes displaying stable patterns. Aristotle's generic and universal propositions have become tools of inquiry rather than results of inquiry.\n\nModern induction starts with a question to be answered or a problem to be solved. It identifies problematic subject-matter and seeks potentially relevant qualities and conditions. Generic existential data thus identified are reformulated—stated abstractly as if-then universal relations capable of serving as answers or solutions.\n\nDewey described these abstract steps concretely with the example of the kind \"morning dew.\" From antiquity, the common-sense belief had been that \"All dew is a kind of rain,\" meaning dew drops fall. By the early 1800s the curious absence of rain and the growth of understanding led scientists to examine new qualities. Functional qualities of bodies [kinds] as solid-liquid-gas at different temperatures, and operational constants of conduction and radiation, led to new inductive hypotheses \"directly suggested by \"this\" subject-matter, not by any data [kinds] previously observable. ... There were certain [existential] conditions postulated in the content of the new [non-existential] conception about dew, and it had to be determined whether these conditions were satisfied in the \"observable\" facts of the case.\n\nAfter demonstrating that dew could be formed by these generic existential phenomena, and not by other phenomena, the universal hypothesis arose that dew forms following established laws of temperature and pressure. \"The outstanding conclusion is that inductive procedures are those which \"prepare\" existential material so that it has convincing evidential weight with respect to an inferred generalization. Existential data are not pre-known natural kinds, but become conceptual statements of \"natural\" processes.\n\nDewey concluded that nature is not a collection of natural kinds, but rather of reliable processes discoverable by competent induction and deduction. Assuming kinds to be given leads to the error of assuming that conceptual universal propositions can serve as evidence for generic propositions; observed consequences affirm imagined causes. \"For an 'inference' that is not \"grounded\" in the evidential nature of the material from which it is drawn is \"not\" an inference. It is a more or less wild guess.\" Modern induction is not a guess about natural kinds, but a means to create instrumental understanding.\n\nIn 1969, Willard Van Orman Quine brought the term \"natural kind\" into contemporary analytic philosophy with an essay bearing that title. His opening paragraph laid out his approach in three parts. First, it questioned the logical and scientific legitimacy of reasoning inductively from a few samples to all members of a kind. \"What tends to confirm an induction?\" Second, it assumed that colors are inductively-identified natural kinds, despite some logical puzzles that can be solved: non-black ravens and green-blue emeralds. Finally, it suggested that human psychological structure can explain the illogical success of induction: \"an innate flair that we have for natural kinds.\n\nQuine believed the ancient method of induction can identify kinds. It groups experiences into kinds by recognizing qualities shared by observed similar objects: \"... each [observed] black raven tends to confirm the law [universal proposition] that all ravens are black ...\" Observing shared generic traits warrants the inductive universal prediction that future experience will confirm the sharing: \"And every reasonable [universal] expectation depends on resemblance of [generic] circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects.\" \"The notion of a kind and the notion of similarity or resemblance seem to be variants or adaptations of a single [universal] notion. Similarity is immediately definable in terms of kind; for things are similar when they are two of a kind.\"\n\nQuine interpreted humanity's \"innate flair for natural kinds\" as intuitive recognition of criteria for judging degrees of similarity among objects. These criteria work instrumentally when applied inductively: \"... why does our innate subjective spacing [grouping] of [existential] qualities accord so well with the functionally relevant [universal] groupings in nature as to make our inductions tend to come out right?\"\n\nHe admitted that generalizing after observing a few similarities is scientifically and logically unjustified. The number and degrees of similarities and differences humans experience are infinite. But the method is justified by its instrumental success in revealing natural kinds. The \"problem of induction\" is how humans \"should stand better than random or coin-tossing chances of coming out right when we predict by inductions which are based on our innate, scientifically unjustified similarity standards.\"\n\nQuine credited human ability to recognize colors as natural kinds to their evolutionary role in human survival—distinguishing safe from poisonous kinds of food. He recognized that modern science often judges color similarities to be superficial, but denied that replacing obvious similarities by abstract universal similarities makes natural kinds any less permanent and important. The human brain's capacity to recognize abstract kinds joins the brain's capacity to recognize existential similarities.\n\nQuine argued that the success of innate and learned criteria for judging degrees of similarity, applied inductively to small samples of kinds, constitutes evidence of the existence of natural kinds; observed consequences affirm imagined causes. His reasoning continues to provoke philosophical debates.\n\nIn 1993 Hilary Kornblith published a review of debates about natural kinds since Quine had launched that epistemological project a quarter-century earlier. He evaluated Quine's \"picture of natural knowledge\" as natural kinds, along with subsequent refinements.\n\nQuine's original assumption that discovering knowledge of mind-independent reality depends on inductive reasoning, despite its being illogical, continued to be acceptable. His further assumption that success of inductive reasoning confirms both the existence of natural kinds and the legitimacy of the method also continued unquestioned, by Kornblith himself and scholars at large.\n\nQuine's assumption of an innate human psychological process--\"standard of similarity,\" \"subjective spacing of qualities\"—also remained unquestioned. Kornbluth provided new labels for the necessary cognitive qualities: \"native processes of belief acquisition,\" \"the structure of human conceptual representation,\" \"native inferential processes,\" \"reasonably accurate detectors of covariation.\" \"To my mind, the primary case to be made for the view that our [universal] psychological processes dovetail with the [generic] causal structure of the world comes ... from the success of science.\n\nKornblith denied that this logic makes human classifications the same as mind-independent classifications: \"The categories of modern science, of course, are not innate.\" But he offered no explanation of how the two can be distinguished.\n\nKornblith didn't explain how tedious modern induction accurately attributes a generic quality to all of some universal kind. He attributed such success to individual sensitivity that a single case is representative of all of a kind.\n\nAccepting intuition as a legitimate ground for inductive inferences from small samples, Kornblith criticized popular arguments by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman that intuition is irrational. He continued to argue that traditional induction explains the success of modern science.\n\nHasok Chang and Rasmus Winther contributed essays to a collection entitled \"Natural Kinds and Classification in Scientific Practice\", published in 2016. The editor of the collection, Catherine Kendig, envisioned a new sense of natural kinds, different from traditional classifications of objects according to their \"essences, laws, sameness relations, fundamental properties ... and how these map out the ontological space of the world.\" She collected original works examining results of discipline-specific classifications of kinds: \"the empirical use of natural kinds and what I dub 'activities of natural kinding' and 'natural kinding practices'.\" Her natural kinds include scientific disciplines themselves, each with its own methods of inquiry and resulting natural knowledge.\n\nChang's contribution displayed Kendig's \"natural kinding activities\" or \"practice turn\" by reporting classifications in the discipline of chemistry—a field renowned for examples of timeless natural kinds: \"All water is HO;\" \"All gold has atomic number 79.\"\n\nTaking prior classifications of kinds as given, he illustrated how chemists' methods and results are both used and developed: \"how fundamental classificatory concepts become refined and corrected through our practical scientific engagement with nature. Any considerable and lasting success of such engagement generates confidence in the classificatory concepts used in it, and invites us to consider them as 'natural'.\"\n\nChang explicitly rejected Quine's basic assumption that natural kinds are real generic objects. \"When I speak of a (natural) kind in this chapter, I am referring to a [universal] classificatory concept, rather than a collection of objects.\" His kinds result from humanity's continuous knowledge-seeking activities called science and philosophy. \"Putting these notions more unambiguously in terms of concepts rather than objects, I maintain: if we hit upon some stable and effective classificatory concepts in our inquiry, we should cherish them (calling them 'natural kinds' would be one clear way of doing so), but without presuming that we have thereby found some eternal essences.\n\nTreating human classifications as natural kinds means endorsing both the practices and findings of modern scholars, without considering possible flaws in either practices or findings; observed consequences affirm imagined causes. Chang used the example of phlogiston to explain modern practice in chemistry.\n\nPhlogiston was once considered by scientists to be a combustible object capable of explaining fire and its heat. Phlogiston was combustible because it contained heat in latent form. \"All fire is liberated phlogiston.\" But when subjected to newly-understood processes such as oxidization and calcination, the kind phlogiston failed to perform as intellectually required. New properties of combustion led to denial of the existence of phlogiston.\n\nChang did not describe the inductive and deductive methods that led chemists to dismiss phlogiston. But he argued that those methods could just as well have been successfully applied to imaginary phlogiston as to oxidization and calcination that displaced it. \"I think phlogiston should have been regarded as a natural kind as much as anything else.\"\n\nChang claimed his examples of classification practices in chemistry confirmed the fallacy of the traditional assumption that natural kinds exist as mind-independent reality. He attributed this belief more to imagining supernatural intervention in the world, than to illogical induction. He did not consider the popular belief that innate psychological capacities enable traditional induction to work.\n\n"}
{"id": "30991248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30991248", "title": "Nepali Sign Language", "text": "Nepali Sign Language\n\nNepalese Sign Language or Nepali Sign Language is the main deaf sign language of Nepal. It is a somewhat standardized language based informally on the variety of Kathmandu, with some input from varieties of Pokhara and elsewhere. As an indigenous sign language, it is not related to oral Nepali. The newly promulgated constitution on Nepal 2072 (2015) had specifically mentioned the right to have education in Sign Language for the deaf. Likewise the newly passed Disability right act 2072 (2017) in its definition of Language has mentioned \"“Language” means spoken and sign languages and other forms of speechless language. \" in practice it is recognized by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare, and is used (albeit in a somewhat pidginized form) in all schools for the deaf. In addition, there is legislation underway in Nepal which, in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) which Nepal has ratified, should give Nepalese Sign Language equal status with the oral languages of the country.\n\nNepalese Sign Language may have originated in the first school for the deaf in Nepal, established in Kathmandu in 1966 by an ENT doctor. The school was later moved to a children’s home in Naxal. The aim of the school was to teach speech therapy to deaf children to have them learn to speak. Even so, deaf people who went to the school at this time recall using signs with each other during and after school. The oral policy continued until the arrival of the Patricia Ross, who tried to have total communication introduced into the school in 1985.\n\nIn 1980, 13 young Kathmandu deaf established the Deaf Welfare Association. This was the first association of any type established by disabled themselves and run under their own leadership & management. Later the name of the organization was changed to Kathmandu Association of the Deaf (KAD). One of the chief goals of KAD was social reform of deaf people with an effort to promote and further develop sign language. At the time sign language was still banned in the deaf school; however, KAD worked hard to keep it alive at deaf gatherings on weekends. Later KAD developed a one-handed fingerspelling system for devanagari with the support of UNICEF.\n\nAs we will see below in the section on work on the first NSL dictionary was undertaken by an American in conjunction with KAD. Although this American was hearing, she had a basic knowledge of the American Sign Language and had worked with deaf in Jamaica previously as a volunteer. Although the process of collecting signs focused on Nepalese Sign Language itself, it is hard to imagine that the process did not occasionally involve Ross interjecting signs she already knew. Thus, it is hard to imagine that there was no influence from other languages (e.g. ASL) during this process. In addition, Nepalese deaf had already had contact with some Italian and Swedish Deaf who had come Nepal as tourists.\n\nGenerally speaking then, NSL developed as a natural language established by the deaf community of Kathmandu valley, but we cannot deny the influence of the other sign languages, nor of artificial systems of sign such as Total Communication or Simultaneous Communication. This influence from outside due to contact (with, for example Indian Sign Language and with structural principles introduced from artificial sign systems used in the United States) was strong during its initial stage of the formation, but in different ways and to different degrees remains strong to this day (although the contact is more with International Sign, American Sign Language and various European sign languages used by visiting deaf tourists and by deaf from European funding organizations). There are also, not surprisingly, semantic overlaps with spoken Nepali (and perhaps other spoken languages).\n\nAlthough much work remains yet to be done, it is clear that Nepalese Sign Language is not used natively by the overwhelming majority of deaf people in Nepal. There are a number of reasons for this. The main reason, however, is that, as with hearing Nepalese, the majority of deaf in Nepal live in villages, surrounded by non-signing hearing population and not in contact with NSL users. Since the overwhelming majority of deaf children in Nepal as in all countries are born into hearing families without a single signing member, Nepalese Sign Language is primarily learned first at schools for the deaf. However, as these schools are few in number, and not readily accessible to most, it can be concluded that most deaf Nepalese have no opportunity to acquire Nepalese Sign Language under normal circumstances. (To a certain small extent, the National Deaf Federation Nepal, in programs funded by the Swedish Deaf Association (SDR), Deaf Way-UK and other funders, sends trained deaf sign language instructors to remote villages to teach deaf there (and their families and fellow villagers) the basics of Nepalese Sign Language. Unfortunately, such instructors are few in number, and cannot possibly reach all deaf Nepalese.\n\nWhile the vast majority of non-hearing Nepalese do not have the opportunity to acquire NSL, those who are a part of the country’s active Deaf communities are often well connected to wide international network of signers through formal relationships with foreign Deaf organizations and personal relationships with foreign signers initiated and maintained through channels such as tourism, Facebook, and Skype chatting.\n\nBoth of these extremes affect NSL. Researchers have discussed the homesign systems generated by Deaf Nepalese in the absence of or in addition to NSL, which are one source of linguistic variation in the language and the potential impact of late exposure to NSL on signing practice. In addition, scholars have noted that first exposure to signing practice often takes place in schools for the deaf, where classes are taught primarily by hearing teachers who use Signed Nepali or Sign-Supported Nepali (that is, signing that uses lexical items from NSL but grammatical constructions from spoken Nepali); this code can become another source of variation in Deaf Nepalese' signing repertoire.\n\nAs mentioned above, a one-handed fingerspelling system for devanagari, the Nepali manual alphabet, was developed by KAD with the support of UNICEF. Although the idea behind this alphabet may have been motivated by foreign fingerspelling alphabets (especially American manual alphabet and the International manual alphabet), in fact only a few of the forms of the letters can be said to derive directly from those foreign alphabets (i.e. अ from “a”, ब from “b”, म from “m”, and र from “r”).\n\nThe Nepalese Manual Alphabet is used not for NSL per se, but for code switching into Nepali (i.e. when a signer spells out a personal or place name, or a Nepali word). The importance of the forms of this alphabet are, however, not restricted to this function. Indeed, fingerspelling handshapes have been widely used in development of new signs, through a process perhaps borrowed from America's various systems of Signed English, whereby the initial letter of the Nepali word is incorporated into the NSL, thus creating so-called \"initialized signs\". Perhaps more than anything else, it is this system of initialized signs which makes the lexicon of NSL structurally different from the lexicon of Indian Sign Language.\n\nThe classification of Nepalese Sign Language is currently under dispute. Older work has suggested that Nepalese Sign Language is not related to other sign languages. Wittmann (1991) posits that NSL is a language isolate (a 'prototype' sign language), though one developed through stimulus diffusion from an existing sign language, likely Indo-Pakistani Sign Language or the systems that underlay it. Gallaudet University reports that NSL was \"developed by the Peace Corps from local and American signs\".\n\nWoodward (1993) compared sign-language varieties in India, Pakistan and Nepal and found cognate rates of 62–71%. He concluded these are separate languages of the same family. Zeshan concludes that “IPSL may be in use throughout India, Pakistan, and Nepal with varying degrees of dialectal variation”.\n\nAlthough it is indisputable that Nepalese Sign Language shares a significant number of signs with the various varieties of sign languages of the Indian Subcontinent (specifically Delhi and Bombay varieties of Indian Sign Language) and Karachi variety of Pakistani Sign Language), argues that previous work, especially that of Woodward and Zeshan cited above, suffer from numerous flaws, both in theory, method, data and conclusion. Both use lexicostatistical methods which have been widely criticized (and discarded) by historical linguists for decades. In addition, although both modify the word lists on which they perform their statistics, they nevertheless apply cutoff percentages derived from the standard word lists.\n\nAlthough it is unclear how or where Zeshan obtained her data (as she has never been in Nepal), Woodward is clear: his data is obtained from the first \"dictionary\" of Nepalese Sign Language. This dictionary, as many first attempts, has numerous flaws, including the fact that at least one of the sign language informants had received his education in India, and thus his sign language at least is likely to be influenced by Indian Sign Language, thus potentially skewing the data in favor of Woodward's conclusions.\n\nAs Morgan shows, an analysis of the sign languages as currently used in Nepal (i.e. the national sign language) and India (standard Indian Sign Language), argues for two alternative conclusions. One likely alternative is that Nepalese Sign Language was never a member of a proposed Indo-Pakistani Sign Language family, and all supposed cognate signs are either the result of borrowing (NSL has been influenced by ISL signing practices, particularly in the schools for the deaf in the south of the country), a shared South Asian gestural base (which Zeshan herself alludes to as an area which needs further research), or of chance similarity. Another possible alternative is that at one point in time Nepalese Sign Language and Indo-Pakistani Sign Language did in fact share a common source, but subsequent (and rapid) changes in NSL (and likewise in IPSL) over the past 30 years have resulted in a situation where the two languages are no longer related.\n\nWork on documenting the lexicon of Nepalese Sign Language started in the mid-1980s. The first work collecting signs in Nepal that we know of was started in 1985. Patricia Ross, an American Peace Corps volunteer, was a pioneer in sign language research in Nepal. However, her work with Kathmandu Association of the Deaf (KAD) was to collect already existing signs, not creating new signs. As she herself writes: \"The initial stumbling block in initiating total communication in Nepal was the lack of any recorded sign language. Many people did not know that there was a fully developed system of Nepalese signs. Despite the fact that sign was not used in the schools, the deaf people, out of their own need to communicate, had developed an intricate system of signs\". Regarding the process of collecting signs, Ross further stated: \"I would write down words and the students would discuss and argue about what the proper sign was. Slowly and patiently the students taught me their signs, their language.\" Ross's work collecting NSL signs eventually lead to the publication of the first Nepalese Sign Language dictionary.\n\nSubsequently, the National Deaf Federation Nepal (at that time called National Federation of Deaf and Hearing Impaired, or NFDN) published a much more extensive dictionary, and continues to work on both documenting and supplementing the Nepalese Sign language lexicon.\n\nDespite the incongruity of applying the term phonology to a sign language, like other sign languages Nepalese Sign Language also has a sub-morphemic level of structuring which is analogous (to a certain degree at least) to phonology in spoken languages.\n\nAs such, the standard sign language model of phonology (first developed by William Stokoe for American Sign Language and originally called cherology) can be applied to Nepalese Sign Language as well, according to which signs are analyzable according to five parameters:\n\n\nAlthough linguistic research on Nepalese Sign Language is still in its infancy, and we do not have a complete list of for any of these parameters we can safely state that:\n\n\nOne of the problems of phonemic analysis on NSL, which is also manifest in other sign languages, is the absence of extensive lists of minimal pairs such as are typically found for all spoken languages. While such pairs are impossible to find for all possible minimal pairs, a sufficient number of such pairs can be produced to justify the method. Such pairs are especially easy to find in cases of initialized signs; thus, for example, while the index finger with tip indexic the back of the opposite wrist indicates the generic term TIME (Nepali: समय /samaj/), a म /ma/ handshape indicates OPPORTUNITY (Nepali: मौका /mauka:/), a फ /pʰa/ handshape indicates FREETIME (Nepali: फुर्सत /pʰursat/), etc.\n\nNepalese Sign Language shares a number of features with most sign languages studied to date:\n\nMorphology in NSL, as in languages in general, comes in two types: derivational morphology and grammatical or inflectional morphology.\n\nOne feature which is difficult to ignore is incorporation. This feature is a pervasive one, and one which blurs the border between phonology, which is \"supposed\" to be meaningless (i.e. capable of distinguishing meaning without having meaning of its own) and morphology, where all forms have meaning. Thus for example, we have incorporation of handshapes from the Nepali manual alphabet into lexical items as we saw above the sections above on manual alphabet and lexicon.\n\nIncorporation also occurs in NSL verbs, in what are often referred to as \"classifier predicates\". Here, as in many other sign languages studied,) the pattern is ergative-accusative, with subjects of intransitive verbs (e.g. ONE-PERSON in \"One person passed by in front of me\")), and objects of transitive verbs (e.g. \"thick classifier\" in \"I ate a buff burger\").\n\nWilliam Stokoe, the \"founder\" of (American) Sign Linguistics, proposed a theoretical revision called \"Semantic Phonology\". Under such a proposal, the sign for TEA चिया /chiya:/ could be seen as a complete predicate, with the \"classifier\"—in this case the Nepali manual alphabet handshape च /cha/ standing for TEA चिया /chiya:/ -- being incorporated into a \"verb\" DRINK.\n\nFrequently, and especially at the level of the lexicon, instruments are also incorporated.\n\nMany verbs also agree in person (and number) with the subject and object (often the indirect object, as e.g. \"He stared at me\" with the sign LOOK-AT directed from third person to first person). However, there is no grammatical or semantic criteria, other than it being transitive which can determine whether a verb will manifest agreement or not. To a limited extend the phonological feature of being \"body anchored\" (that is, having contact with the body at some point during execution) can limit agreement (e.g. a sign which starts with a body contact will be less free to show subject agreement, and a sign which ends with body contact will be less free to show object agreement).\n\nThus, in sentences of the type \"I gave a book to you\" we may have a single sign GIVE, inflected for agreement (motion of the verb begins from the signer (= I) and moves towards the recipient [= you]), and the handshape of the verb GIVE is modified to incorporate a \"thick classifier\" handling classifier handshape (= object the size and shape of a BOOK).\n\nTypically, in discourse, sentences are short, and verbal arguments (actants) are often left to context (leading to average clause length of less than 2 signs). In addition, NSL (like other sign languages), tends to be topicalizing; that is, the topic is fronted (moved to the front of the clause). Given these two facts, it is hard to a \"Basic Word Order\" for NSL; nevertheless, in those instances where both agent and patient are lexicalized and where there is no topicalization (e.g. in artificially elicited sentences in isolation), the word order tends to be SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) --- just like Nepali and most members of the South Asian Sprachbund.\n\nDiscourse in Nepalese Sign Language shares many features with discourse in other sign language:\n\n\nIn addition to the national sign language, several local indigenous 'village' sign languages have been identified. The following “village sign languages” have been identified: Jhankot Sign Language, Jumla Sign Language, and Ghandruk Sign Language. Although insufficiently studied, they each appear to be mutually unintelligible to native signers of Nepalese Sign language, and thus qualify as separate sign languages.\n\n"}

{"id": "1832038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1832038", "title": "Phi features", "text": "Phi features\n\nIn linguistics, especially within generative grammar, phi features (denoted with the Greek letter φ 'phi') are the semantic features of person, number, gender, and case, as encoded in pronominal agreement with nouns and pronouns (the latter are said to consist only of phi-features, containing no lexical head). Several other features are included in the set of phi-features, such as the categorical features ±N (nominal) and ±V (verbal), which can be used to describe lexical categories and case features.\n\nPhi-features are often thought of as the \"silent\" features that exist on lexical heads (or, according to some theories, within the syntactic structure) that are understood for number, gender, person or reflexivity. Due to their silent nature, phi-features are often only understood if someone is a native speaker of a language, or if the translation includes a gloss of all these features. Many languages exhibit a pro-drop phenomenon which means that they rely on other lexical categories to determine the phi-features of the lexical heads.\n\nChomsky first proposed that the N node in a clause carries with it all the features to include person, number and gender. In English, we rely on nouns to determine the phi-features of a word, but other languages rely on inflections of the different parts of speech to determine person, number and gender of the nominal phrases to which they refer. Mainly verbs and adjectives are responsible for bearing inflections which signal the phi-features of a particular subject or object. Verbs appear to be responsible for carrying the most features and tend to carry person, number and gender agreements cross-linguistically for both subjects and objects. Adjectives also carry phi-features in some languages, they tend to agree in number and gender but rarely for person .\n\nIn English, person agreement is understood in the pronoun or noun overtly, while the verb carries the agreement marker to agree with the person phi-features on the Noun. For English, there is only one verb agreement required for the third person singular in the present tense (usually -s), as seen in the table Person Agreement for WALK: English. \n\nIn a null-subject language such as Italian, however, subjects are not required (in fact, in many null subject languages, producing overt subjects is a sign of non-nativity). Therefore, Italian uses a different inflectional morphology for each pronominal that is based not the person features of the nominal subject it agrees with:\n\n- Camminare (\"to walk\"):\ncammino (\"I walk)\", camminiamo (\"we walk\")\n\ncammini (\"you walk\"), camminate (\"you all walk\")\n\ncammina (\"he/she walks\"), camminano (\"they walk\")\nIn English, number agreement is not inflected on Verbs like they are in other languages. This is partly because English is a language that requires subjects and the subjects in English overtly express number. In English, number is a phi-feature that is understood on the noun. In terms of inflectional morphology, the most common in English is \"-s\" inflected on nouns that are plural:\n\n- Ducks, fridges, baseballs, cups, books, mirrors, cars, buildings, clowns, bridges, creams...\n\nSome cases of plurality in English require conjugation of the entire noun to express the phi-feature of plurality:\n\n- Men, women, mice, teeth...\n\nNeither verbs nor adjectives are used to agree with the phi-features of the noun that they are agreeing with in English.\nEnglish is a language that does not have gendered nominal phrases and pronouns (except in the case of proper names of nouns that are sentient beings who belong to a certain gender category) and does not have phi-feature agreement for gender. Many other languages of the world do have gendered nouns. German, for example, has three genders; feminine, masculine and neuter. Italian has two: feminine and masculine phi-features. For Italian, inflections on the adjectives and determiners are used for gender agreement within the pronominal phrase.\n\nReflexivity is overt in English for every person:\n\nmyself\", yourself\", himself, yourselves, ourselves, themselves\n\nIn many languages, reflexivity is not overt for person. A prime example is apparent in French \"se\". French \"se\" is used to express reflexivity for every expression of the third person. For this reason, some theories suggest that reflexive phi-features for languages such as French posit in a level on the syntactic structure that is silent, between the determiner and the noun.\n\nX'-theory approaches categorical features in this way: when a head X selects its' complement to project to X', the XP that it projects to then is a combination of the head X and all of its' categorical features, those being either nominal, verbal, adjectival or prepositional features.\n"}
{"id": "1223831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1223831", "title": "Phonestheme", "text": "Phonestheme\n\nThe term phonestheme (; phonaestheme in British English) was coined in 1930 by British linguist J. R. Firth (from the Greek φωνή \"phone\", \"sound\", and αἴσθημα \"aisthema\", \"perception\" from αίσθάνομαι \"aisthanomai\", \"I perceive\") to label the systematic pairing of form and meaning in a language. Such pairing would violate the arbitrariness principle of semantics.\n\nA phonestheme is different from a morpheme because it does not meet the normal criterion of compositionality.\n\nWithin Peirce's \"theory of signs\" the phonestheme is considered to be an \"icon\" rather than a \"symbol\" or an \"index\".\n\nPhonesthemes are of critical interest to students of the internal structure of words because they appear to be a case where the internal structure of the word is non-compositional; i.e., a word with a phonestheme in it has other material in it that is not itself a morpheme. Phonesthemes \"fascinate some linguists\", as Ben Zimmer has phrased it, in a process that can become \"mystical\" or \"unscientific\". \n\nFor example, the English phonestheme \"gl-\" occurs in a large number of words relating to light or vision, like \"glitter\", \"glisten\", \"glow\", \"gleam\", \"glare\", \"glint\", \"glimmer\", \"gloss\", and so on; yet, despite this, the remainder of each word is not itself a phonestheme (i.e., a pairing of form and meaning); i.e., \"-isten\", \"-ow\", and \"-eam\" do not make meaningful contributions to \"glisten\", \"glow\", and \"gleam\".\nThere are three main ways in which phonesthemes are empirically identified.\n\nThe first is through corpus studies, where the words of a language are subjected to statistical analysis, and the particular form-meaning pairing, or phonestheme, is shown to constitute a statistically unexpected distribution in the lexicon or not.\n\nCorpus studies can inform a researcher about the current state of the lexicon, a critical first step, but importantly are completely uninformative when it comes to questions of whether and how phonesthemes are represented in the minds of language users.\n\nThe second type of approach makes use of the tendency for phonesthemes to participate in the coinage and interpretation of neologisms (i.e., new words in a language). Various studies have demonstrated that, when asked to invent or interpret new words, subjects tend to follow the patterns that are predicted by the phonesthemes in their language. It is known, for example, that the word \"bangle\" is a loan from Hindi but speakers tend to associate it with English onomatopoeia like \"bang\". While this approach demonstrates the vitality of phonesthemic patterns, it does not provide any evidence about whether (or how) phonesthemes are represented in the minds of speaker-hearers.\n\nThe final type of evidence uses the methods of psycholinguistics to study exactly how phonesthemes participate in language processing. One such method is phonesthemic priming — akin to morphological priming — which demonstrates that people represent phonesthemes much as they do typical morphemes, despite the fact that phonesthemes are non-compositional.\n\nDiscussions of phonesthesia are often grouped with other phenomena under the rubric of sound symbolism.\n\nPhonesthemes have been documented in numerous languages from diverse language families, among them English, Swedish, and other Indo-European languages, Austronesian languages, and Japanese.\n\nWhile phonesthemes have mostly been identified in the onsets of words and syllables, they can have other forms. There has been some argument that sequences like \"-ash\" and \"-ack\" in English also serve as phonesthemes, due to their patterning in words that denote forceful, destructive contact (\"smash\", \"crash\", \"bash\", etc.) and abrupt contact (\"smack\", \"whack\", \"crack\", etc.), respectively.\n\nIn addition to the distribution of phonesthemes, linguists consider their \"motivation\". In some cases, there may appear to be good sound-symbolic reasons why phonesthemes would have the form they have. In the case of \"-ack\", for example, we might imagine that the words sharing this phonestheme do so because they denote events that would produce a similar sound. But critically, there are many phonesthemes for which there can be no sound-symbolic basis, such as \"gl-\", for the simple reason that their meanings (such as 'pertaining to light or vision') entail no sound.\n\nWhile there are numerous studies on living languages, research is lacking about ancient languages, although the first documented example of phonesthemes dates back to at least the fourth century B.C.: Plato's\nCratylus clearly mentioned the gl- and st- phonesthemes and their explanation in terms of phonosemantics.\n\nExamples of phonesthemes in English (aside from \"gl-\"), include \"sn-\", related to the mouth or nose, as in \"snarl\", \"snout\", \"snicker\", \"snack\", and so on; and there is also a set of words starting with \"sl-\", which appears in words denoting frictionless motion, like \"slide\", \"slick\", \"sled\", and so on - which are themselves a subset of a larger set of words beginning with sl- that are pejorative behaviours, traits, or events: slack, slouch, sludge, slime, slosh, slash, sloppy, slug, sluggard, slattern, slut, slang, sly, slither, slow, sloth, sleepy, sleet, slip, slipshod, slope, slit, slay, sleek, slant, slovenly, slab, slap, slough, slum, slump, slobber, slaver, slur, slog, slate.\n\nA further phonesthetic phenomenon, ablaut phonesthesia, mimics the paradigm of a strong verb like \"swim\" : \"swam\" : \"swum\" with internal vowel change or \"apophony\". Take the word \"flip.\" It has an alliterative group, \"fl-\", that evokes the volatility of fly, flow, flee, fleet, flash, flake, and flick. Its rhymes, dip, sip, quip, drip, pip, tip, slip, and so forth, add to a connotation of minor labile action. But it is also part of an ablaut series where vowel alternation has semantic value (as in \"flip-flop\").\n\nThis kind of vowel alternation can be found in reduplicated word pairs like \"pitter-patter,\" \"chit-chat,\" \"tip-top,\" or \"tip-tap.\"\n\nA regularity of phonesthetic relationship is shown by proportional analogies such as clip : clasp :: grip : grasp; or crash : crush :: mash : mush; or crash : crunch :: mash : munch.\n\n\n\n"}

The term is derived from the Sicilian \"pizzu\" ('beak'). To \"let someone wet their beak\" (Sicilian language \"fari vagnari u pizzu\") is to pay protection money. The practice is widespread in Southern Italy, not only by the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, but also by the 'Ndrangheta in Calabria and the Camorra in Campania. \n\nAnother etymological explanation of the term is \"beakerful\", referring to the right of an overseer to scoop from the grain being threshed by peasants. Paying the pizzo might also be in kind, for example by forcing a company to put someone (often a member of a criminal organisation) on the payroll, compulsory provision of services by Mafia controlled businesses as well as subcontracting to Mafia-controlled companies.\n\nBusinesses that refuse to pay the pizzo might be burned down. In return, businesses receive \"protection\" and can enlist neighbourhood Mafiosi to cut through bureaucracy or resolve disputes with other tradesmen. Collecting the pizzo keeps the Mafia in touch with the community and allows it to \"control their territory\".\n\nThe Mafia extorts more than 160 million euro a year from shops and businesses in the Palermo region, with the island as a whole paying 10 times that figure, investigators estimate. Around 80 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay up a pizzo. According to Palermo University, the pizzo averages 457 euros (640 dollars) a month for retail traders and 578 for hotels and restaurants, but construction companies are asked to pay over 2,000 euros per month according to economic daily Il Sole 24 Ore's figures.\n\nOne of the first to refuse to pay protection money was Libero Grassi, a shopkeeper from Palermo. In January 1991, he wrote an open letter to the \"Giornale di Sicilia\", the local newspaper. Published on the front page, it was addressed to an anonymous \"Dear Extortionist\". It caused an uproar and, later that same year, Grassi was murdered.\n\nIn 2004, Addiopizzo – a grassroots social conscious-motivated consumer movement – frustrated with the Mafia's stranglehold on the local economy and political life, peppered Palermo with stickers stating: \"An entire populace who pays pizzo is a mob without dignity.\" They organise demonstrations wearing black T-shirts with the Addiopizzo logo, a broken circle with an X in the middle and the words \"consumo critico\" (critical consumption).\n\n\n"}

He had made the trip to visit relatives, mainly in his native Siberia, and make contacts for the network, which teaches conflict resolution skills under the auspices of the United Nations Association of Australia. Although both Soviet and Australian authorities had assured Patrushev that it was safe for him to travel to the Soviet Union on his Australian passport, he was still detained, \"most of the time in a hot and stuffy airport hotel, without being able to contact the Australian Embassy or his waiting relatives.\" He was freed with no explanation, except that of the hotel manager who commented: \"See, perestroika is working.\"\n\nUntil his death, he lived in Jervis Bay, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, with his wife and son.\n\n\n\n "}

{"id": "11240679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11240679", "title": "Stieg Larsson", "text": "Stieg Larsson\n\nKarl Stig-Erland \"Stieg\" Larsson (; ; 15 August 1954 – 9 November 2004) was a Swedish journalist and writer. He is best known for writing the \"Millennium\" trilogy of crime novels, which were published posthumously and adapted as motion pictures. Larsson lived much of his life in Stockholm and worked there with socialist politics and journalism, including as an independent researcher of right-wing extremism.\n\nHe was the second best-selling author in the world for 2008, behind Khaled Hosseini. The third novel in the \"Millennium\" trilogy, \"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\", became the most sold book in the United States in 2010, according to \"Publishers Weekly\". By March 2015, his series had sold 80 million copies worldwide.\n\nStieg Larsson was born on 15 August 1954, as Karl Stig-Erland Larsson, in Umeå, Västerbottens län, Sweden, where his father and maternal grandfather worked in the Rönnskärsverken smelting plant. Suffering from arsenic poisoning, his father resigned from his job, and the family subsequently moved to Stockholm. But because of their cramped living conditions, they chose to let one-year-old Larsson remain behind. So until the age of nine, Larsson lived with his grandparents in a small wooden house in the countryside, near the village of Bjursele in Norsjö Municipality, Västerbotten County. He attended the village school and used cross-country skis to get to and from school during the long, snowy winters in northern Sweden. He loved the experience of living there.\n\nIn the book \"\"There Are Things I Want You to Know\" About Stieg Larsson and Me\", Eva Gabrielsson describes this as Larsson's motivation for setting part of his first novel \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" in northern Sweden, which Gabrielsson calls \"godforsaken places at the back of beyond.\"\n\nLarsson was not as fond of the urban environment in the city of Umeå, where he moved to live with his parents after his grandfather, Severin Boström, died of a heart attack at age 50. In 1974, Larsson was drafted into the Swedish Army, under the conscription law, and spent 16 months in compulsory military service, training as a mortarman in an infantry unit in Kalmar.\n\nHis mother Vivianne also died early, in 1991, from complications with breast cancer and an aneurysm.\n\nOn his 12th birthday, Larsson's parents gave him a typewriter as a birthday gift.\n\nLarsson's first efforts at writing fiction were not in the genre of crime, but rather science fiction. An avid science fiction reader from an early age, he became active in Swedish science fiction fandom around 1971; co-edited, together with Rune Forsgren, his first fanzine, \"Sfären\", in 1972; and attended his first science fiction convention, SF•72, in Stockholm. Through the 1970s, Larsson published around 30 additional fanzine issues; after his move to Stockholm in 1971, he became active in the Scandinavian SF Society, of which he was a board member in 1978 and 1979, and chairman in 1980.\n\nIn his first fanzines, 1972–74, he published a handful of early short stories, while submitting others to other semi-professional or amateur magazines. He was co-editor or editor of several science fiction fanzines, including \"Sfären\" and \"FIJAGH!\"; in 1978–79, he was president of the largest Swedish science-fiction fan club, Skandinavisk Förening för Science Fiction (SFSF). An account of this period in Larsson's life, along with detailed information on his fanzine writing and short stories, is included in the biographical essays written by Larsson's friend John-Henri Holmberg in \"The Tattooed Girl\", by Holmberg with Dan Burstein and Arne De Keijzer, 2011.\n\nIn early June 2010, manuscripts for two such stories, as well as fanzines with one or two others, were noted in the Swedish National Library (to which this material had been donated a few years earlier, mainly by the Alvar Appeltofft Memorial Foundation, which works to further science fiction fandom in Sweden). This discovery of what was called \"unknown\" works by Larsson generated considerable publicity.\n\nWhile working as a photographer, Larsson became engaged in far-left political activism. He became a member of \"Kommunistiska Arbetareförbundet\" (Communist Workers' League), edited the Swedish Trotskyist journal \"Fjärde internationalen\", journal of the Swedish section of the \"Fourth International\". He also wrote regularly for the weekly \"Internationalen\".\n\nLarsson spent parts of 1977 in Eritrea, training a squad of female Eritrean People's Liberation Front guerrillas in the use of mortars. He was forced to abandon that work, having contracted a kidney disease. Upon his return to Sweden, he worked as a graphic designer at the largest Swedish news agency, Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå (TT), between 1977 and 1999.\n\nLarsson's political convictions, as well as his journalistic experiences, led him to found the Swedish Expo Foundation, similar to the British Searchlight Foundation, established to \"counteract the growth of the extreme right and the white power-culture in schools and among young people.\" He also became the editor of the foundation's magazine, \"Expo\", in 1995.\n\nWhen he was not at his day job, he worked on independent research into right-wing extremism in Sweden. In 1991, his research resulted in his first book, \"Extremhögern\" (\"The Extreme Right\"). Larsson quickly became instrumental in documenting and exposing Swedish extreme right and racist organisations; he was an influential debater and lecturer on the subject, reportedly living for years under death threats from his political enemies. The political party Sweden Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna) was a major subject of his research.\n\nLarsson's first name was originally \"Stig\", which is the standard spelling. In his early twenties, he changed it to avoid confusion with his friend Stig Larsson, who would go on to become a well-known author well before Stieg did. The pronunciation is the same regardless of spelling.\n\nLarsson died of a heart attack after climbing the stairs to work on 9 November 2004. He was 50. It was reported that his lifestyle largely consisted of cigarettes, processed food and copious amounts of coffee. He is interred at the Högalid Church cemetery in the district of Södermalm in Stockholm.\n\nIn May 2008, it was announced that a 1977 will, found soon after Larsson's death, declared his wish to leave his assets to the Umeå branch of the Communist Workers League (now the Socialist Party). As the will was unwitnessed, it was not valid under Swedish law, with the result that all of Larsson's estate, including future royalties from book sales, went to his father and brother. His long-term partner Eva Gabrielsson, who found the will, has no legal right to the inheritance, sparking controversy between her and his father and brother. Reportedly, the couple never married because, under Swedish law, couples entering into marriage were required to make their addresses (at the time) publicly available, so marrying would have created a security risk. Owing to his reporting on extremist groups and the death threats he had received, the couple had sought and been granted masking of their addresses, personal data, and identity numbers from public records, to make it harder for others to trace them; this kind of \"identity cover\" was integral to Larsson's work as a journalist and would have been difficult to bypass if the two had married or become registered partners.\n\nAn article in \"Vanity Fair\" magazine discusses Gabrielsson's dispute with Larsson's relatives, which has also been well covered in the Swedish press. She claims the author had little contact with his father and brother, and requests the rights to control his work so it may be presented in the way he would have wanted. Larsson's story was featured on the 10 October 2010 segment of \"CBS News Sunday Morning\".\n\nLarson had originally planned a series of ten books and had completed two and most of a third when he began looking for publishers. At the time of his death in 2004 only three had been completed, and although accepted for publication, none had yet been printed. These were published posthumously as the \"Millennium\" series.\n\nThe first book in the series was published in Sweden as literally\"Men who hate women\" (2005). It was titled for the English-language market as \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" and published in the United Kingdom in February 2008. It was awarded the Glass Key award as the best Nordic crime novel in 2005.\n\nHis second novel, \"Flickan som lekte med elden\" (2006, \"The Girl Who Played with Fire\"), received the Best Swedish Crime Novel Award in 2006 and was published in the United Kingdom in January 2009.\n\nThe third novel, \"Luftslottet som sprängdes\" (\"The Air Castle That was Blown Up\"), published in English as \"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\", was published in the United Kingdom in October 2009 and the United States in May 2010.\n\nLarsson left about three quarters of a fourth novel on a notebook computer, now possessed by his partner, Eva Gabrielsson: synopses or manuscripts of the fifth and sixth in the series, which he intended to comprise an eventual total of ten books, may also exist. Gabrielsson has stated in her book, \"\"There Are Things I Want You to Know\" About Stieg Larsson and Me\" (2011) that she is capable of finishing the book.\n\nIn 2013, Swedish publisher Norstedts contracted David Lagercrantz, a Swedish author and journalist, to continue the \"Millennium\" series. Lagercrantz did not have access to the material in Gabrielsson's possession, which remains unpublished. The book was published in August 2015 in connection with the 10-year anniversary of the series, under the Swedish title \"Det som inte dödar oss\" (literal English translation: \"That Which Does Not Kill Us\"); the English title is \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\". The 5th book in the \"Millennium\" series was released in September, 2017. The Swedish title is \"Mannen som sökte sin skugga\" (literal English translation: \"The Man Who Hunted his Shadow\") and the English title is \"The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye\".\n\nThe Swedish film production company Yellow Bird has produced film versions of the \"Millennium\" series, co-produced with the Danish film production company Nordisk Film, which were released in Scandinavia in 2009.\n\nThrough his written works, as well as in interviews, Larsson acknowledged that a significant number of his literary influences were American and British crime/detective fiction authors. His heroine has some similarities with Carol O'Connell's \"Mallory,\" who first appeared in \"Mallory's Oracle\" (1994). In his work Larsson made a habit of inserting the names of some of his favourites within the text, sometimes by making his characters read the works of Larsson's favorite authors. Topping the list were Sara Paretsky, Agatha Christie, Val McDermid, Dorothy Sayers, Elizabeth George, and Enid Blyton.\n\nOne of the strongest influences originates from his own country: \"Pippi Longstocking\", by Sweden's much-loved children's author Astrid Lindgren. Larsson explained that one of his main recurring characters in the \"Millennium\" series, Lisbeth Salander, is actually fashioned on a grown-up Pippi Longstocking as he chose to sketch her. There are additional connections to Lindgren's literary work in the Larsson novels; for example, the other main character, Mikael Blomkvist, is frequently referred to mockingly by his detractors as \"Kalle Blomkvist\", the name of a fictional teenage detective created by Lindgren.\nThe name Salander was actually inspired by the strong female character in the Kalle Blomkvist trilogy by Astrid Lindgren, Kalle's girlfriend Eva-Lotte Lisander.\n\nLarsson has said when he was 15 years old, he witnessed three of his friends gang-raping a young girl, which led to his lifelong abhorrence of violence and abuse against women. His longtime partner, Eva Gabrielsson, writes that this incident \"marked him for life\" in a chapter of her book that describes Larsson as a feminist. The author never forgave himself for failing to help the girl, and this inspired the themes of sexual violence against women in his books. According to Gabrielsson, the \"Millennium\" trilogy allowed Larsson to express a worldview he was never able to elucidate as a journalist. She described, in great detail, how the fundamental narratives of his three books were essentially fictionalised portraits of the Sweden few people knew, a place where latent white supremacy found expression in all aspects of contemporary life, and anti-extremists lived in persistent fear of attack. \"Everything of this nature described in the \"Millennium\" trilogy has happened at one time or another to a Swedish citizen, journalist, politician, public prosecutor, unionist or policeman,\" she writes. \"Nothing was made up.\"\n\nThere are also similarities between Larsson's Lisbeth Salander and Peter O'Donnell's Modesty Blaise. Both are women from disastrous childhoods who somehow survive to become adults with notable skills, including fighting, and who accomplish good by operating somewhat outside the law. One of Larsson's villains, Ronald Niedermann (a.k.a. \"blonde hulk\"), has much in common with the invulnerable, sociopathic giant named Simon Delicata in the fourth Modesty Blaise book \"A Taste for Death\".\n\n\nStieg Larsson was the first author to sell more than one million e-books on Amazon.com.\n\nSince 2009 Larsson's family and Norstedts have instituted an annual award of 200,000 Swedish Krona in memory of him. The prize is awarded to a person or organisation working in Stieg Larsson's spirit.\n\nThe recipient in 2015 was Chinese author Yang Jisheng for his notable work \"Tombstone\" which describes the consequences of The Three Years of Great Chinese Famine.\n\n\nThe \"Millennium series\":\n\nScience fiction fanzines:\n\nOther:\n\n\n"}

It follows two linguists, Greg Anderson of the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages and David Harrison of Swarthmore College, as they travel around the world to collect recordings of some of the last speakers of several moribund (dying) languages: Chulym in Siberia; Chemehuevi in Arizona, U.S.; Sora in Orissa, India; and Kallawaya in Bolivia.\n\nSeth Kramer, one of the directors, describes how he first got the idea for \"The Linguists\" when, in Vilnius, Lithuania, he could not read Yiddish inscriptions on a path in spite of his Jewish heritage. He joined with Daniel A. Miller in 2003 to form Ironbound Films, and received a $520,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to support the film. Later in 2003, the directors chose Anderson and Harrison to be the protagonists of the film. In 2004, director Jeremy Newberger joined the project.\n\nIt took three years to film \"The Linguists\", and during this time over 200 hours of film were collected. During this time, the cast and crew travelled to numerous remote areas that one reporter describes as \"godforsaken,\" and coped with physical ailments such as altitude sickness.\n\nThe film was completed in August 2007.\n\nThe film begins with the fact that a large proportion of the world's languages (half, out of a total of 7,000, according to the film) are going extinct. The film's two protagonists, Anderson and Harrison, set out both to gather recordings of several endangered languages in order to document these languages later, and to educate viewers about the current rate of language extinction. In the process, they travel to the Andes mountains in South America, to villages in Siberia, to English-Hindi boarding schools in Orissa, India, and to an American Indian reservation in Arizona.\n\nThe film addresses issues including the spread of major global languages and how they contribute to language extinction; political and social reasons that some languages have been repressed; and reasons that language revitalization and language documentation are important (including both maintaining a scientific record of that language, and preserving unique local knowledge and history that is only carried in the local language).\n\nThe film was screened at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, and later had success on the \"indie film circuit.\" It also received attention among the linguistics community on websites such as Language Log.\n\nThe film has been lauded as \"the talk of the town at Sundance;\" \"a fascinating journey;\" \"funny, enlightening and ultimately uplifting;\" \"a hoot;\" and “shaggy and bittersweet.” While it received some minor criticism for choppy, confusing editing, the subject matter has been called \"fascinating\" and \"compelling,\" and the spirit of the film's protagonists has been compared to Indiana Jones.\n\n"}
{"id": "2703121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2703121", "title": "Three Block War", "text": "Three Block War\n\nThe Three Block War is a concept described by U.S. Marine General Charles Krulak in the late 1990s to illustrate the complex spectrum of challenges likely to be faced by Marines on the modern battlefield. In Krulak's example, Marines may be required to conduct full scale military action, peacekeeping operations and humanitarian aid within the space of three contiguous city blocks. The thrust of the concept is that modern militaries must be trained to operate in all three conditions simultaneously, and that to do so, leadership training at the lowest levels needs to be high. The latter condition caused Krulak to invoke what he called \"strategic corporals\"; low-level unit leaders able to take independent action and make major decisions.\n\nThe term has been referenced by then-CENTCOM commander (now Secretary of Defense) General James Mattis, and has also been adopted by the British and Israeli military, including former Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mike Jackson and former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon, and also by former Canadian Chief of Defence Staff Rick Hillier.\n\nThe \"strategic corporal\" is the notion that leadership in complex, rapidly evolving mission environments devolves lower and lower down the chain of command to better exploit time-critical information into the decision making process, ultimately landing on the corporal, the lowest ranking non-commissioned officer, typically commanding a fire team of 4 individuals or a squad of 12 individuals (three fireteams). In very rapidly evolving mission situations, obtaining mission instructions from remotely located command may result in mission failure, or in casualties to both force personnel and civilians. Conversely, misusing this kind of responsibility may result in personal liability for the team leader: a decision executed to respond to situational needs may result in later prosecution as the team leader's actions are reviewed by higher authorities.\n\nThe term \"strategic corporal\" was coined by General Charles C. Krulak in the title of an article in \"Marines Magazine\" about the \"Three Block War,\" an increasingly important arena of military operations characterized by engagement with hostile, neutral and friendly forces, all at the same time, in a very geographically limited area, e.g., three blocks.\n\nThis concept requires forces to apply an appropriate type of response in a timely manner relative to the immediate context. Complex rules of engagement are needed that will minimize collateral damage to civilians and infrastructure. However, training \"strategic corporals\" requires time and money above and beyond what is considered normal infantry or military police training.\n\nThe U.S. Army has used the Strategic Corporal term for their plan to equip ordinary squad leaders with advanced laser rangefinders to plot artillery fire.\n\nThe need to conduct operations in this situation has significantly emphasised the importance of low level tactical leaders and led to the term \"strategic corporal\" being devised.\n\nOne of the adjustments in the USMC is to move coordination of artillery down from the battalion to the company level.\n\nIn the Battle of Mogadishu, as detailed in the book and film \"Black Hawk Down\", small-unit leaders on the ground continually had to make crucial decisions which had major impacts on not only the forces initially deployed on the mission, but to follow on forces as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "166314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166314", "title": "Ulster Scots dialects", "text": "Ulster Scots dialects\n\nUlster Scots or Ulster-Scots ('), also known as Ulster Scotch, Scots-Irish and Ullans, is the Scots language as spoken in parts of Ulster in Ireland. It is generally considered a dialect or group of dialects of Scots, although groups such as the Ulster-Scots Dialect Society and Ulster-Scots Academy consider it a language in its own right, and the Ulster-Scots Agency and former Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure have used the terminology Ulster-Scots language.\n\nSome definitions of Ulster Scots may also include Standard English spoken with an Ulster Scots accent. This is a situation like that of Lowland Scots and Scottish Standard English with words pronounced using the Ulster Scots phonemes closest to those of Standard English.\nUlster Scots has been influenced by Hiberno-English, particularly Mid-Ulster English, and by Ulster Irish. As a result of the competing influences of English and Scots, varieties of Ulster Scots can be described as \"more English\" or \"more Scots\".\n\nThe Scots language arrived in Ulster during the early 17th century, when large numbers of Scots speakers arrived from Lowland Scotland during the Hamilton and Montgomery Settlements and the Ulster Plantation. The earliest Scots writing in Ulster dates from that time, and until the late 20th century, written Scots from Ulster was almost identical with that of Scotland. However, since the revival of interest in the Ulster dialects of Scots in Ulster in the 1990s, new orthographies have been created, which, according to Irish language activist Aodán Mac Póilin, seek \"to be as different to English (and occasionally Scots) as possible.\"\n\nWhile once referred to as \"Scotch-Irish\" by several researchers, that has now been superseded by the term \"Ulster Scots\". Speakers usually refer to their vernacular as 'Braid Scots', 'Scotch' or 'the hamely tongue'. Since the 1980s \"Ullans\", a portmanteau neologism popularized by the physician, amateur historian and politician Ian Adamson, merging \"Ulster\" and \"Lallans\", the Scots for \"Lowlands\", but also an acronym for “Ulster-Scots language in literature and native speech” and \"Ulstèr-Scotch\", the preferred revivalist parlance, have also been used. Occasionally, the term \"Hiberno-Scots\" is used, but it is usually used for the ethnic group rather than the vernacular.\n\nDuring the middle of the 20th century, the linguist R. J. Gregg established the geographical boundaries of Ulster's Scots-speaking areas based on information gathered from native speakers.\n\nUlster Scots is spoken in mid and east Antrim, north Down, north-east County Londonderry, and in the fishing villages of the Mourne coast. It is also spoken in the Laggan district and parts of the Finn Valley in east Donegal and in the south of Inishowen in north Donegal.\n\nThe 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey found that 2% of Northern Ireland residents claimed to speak Ulster Scots, which would mean a total speech community of approximately 30,000 in the territory. Other estimates range from 35,000 in Northern Ireland, to an \"optimistic\" total of 100,000 including the Republic of Ireland (mainly the east of County Donegal). Speaking at a seminar on 9 September 2004, Ian Sloan of the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) accepted that the 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey \"did not significantly indicate that unionists or nationalists were relatively any more or less likely to speak Ulster Scots, although in absolute terms there were more unionists who spoke Ulster Scots than nationalists\".\n\nIn the 2011 census of Northern Ireland, 16,373 people (0.9% of the population) stated that they can speak, read, write and understand Ulster Scots and 140,204 people (8.1% of the population) reported having some ability in Ulster Scots.\n\nEnthusiasts such as Philip Robinson (author of \"Ulster-Scots: a Grammar of the Traditional Written and Spoken Language\"), the Ulster-Scots Language Society and supporters of an Ulster-Scots Academy are of the opinion that Ulster Scots is a language in its own right. That position has been criticised by the Ulster-Scots Agency, a BBC report stating: \"[The Agency] accused the academy of wrongly promoting Ulster-Scots as a language distinct from Scots.\" This position is reflected in many of the Academic responses to the \"Public Consultation on Proposals for an Ulster-Scots Academy\"\n\nSome linguists, such as Raymond Hickey, treat Ulster Scots (and other forms of Scots) as a dialect of English. Other linguists treat it as a variety of the Scots language; Caroline Macafee, for example, writes that \"Ulster Scots is [...] clearly a dialect of Central Scots.\" The \"Concise Ulster Dictionary\" writes that \"Ulster Scots is one dialect of Lowland Scots, now officially regarded as a language by the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages.\" The Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure considers Ulster Scots to be \"the local variety of the Scots language.\" It has been said that its \"status varies between dialect and language\".\n\nUlster Scots is defined in an \"Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland establishing implementation bodies done at Dublin on the 8th day of March 1999\" in the following terms:\n\nThe North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999, which gave effect to the implementation bodies incorporated the text of the agreement in its Schedule 1.\n\nThe declaration made by the United Kingdom Government regarding the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages reads as follows:\n\nThis recognition differed significantly from the commitments entered into under the Charter in relation to Irish, for which specific provisions under Part III were invoked for the protection and promotion of that language. The definition of Ullans from the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999 above was used in 1 July 2005 Second Periodical Report by the United Kingdom to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe outlining how the UK met its obligations under the Charter.\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement (which does not refer to Ulster Scots as a \"language\") recognises Ulster Scots as \"part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland\", and the Implementation Agreement established the cross-border Ulster-Scots Agency (\"Tha Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch\").\n\nThe legislative remit laid down for the agency by the North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999 is: \"the promotion of greater awareness and the use of Ullans and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island\".\n\nThe agency has adopted a mission statement: \"to promote the study, conservation, development and use of Ulster Scots as a living language; to encourage and develop the full range of its attendant culture; and to promote an understanding of the history of the Ulster-Scots people.\" Despite the Agency's reference to Ulster Scots as \"a language\", this eliding of the distinction between Ulster Scots as a linguistic form, and \"Ulster Scots culture\" broadly referring to cultural forms associated with the Scottish-descended population, continued thereafter.\n\nThe Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006 amended the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to insert a section (28D) entitled \"Strategies relating to Irish language and Ulster Scots language etc.\" which inter alia laid on the Executive Committee a duty to \"adopt a strategy setting out how it proposes to enhance and develop the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture.\" This reflects the wording used in the St Andrews Agreement to refer to the enhancement and development of \"the Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture\". There is still controversy on the status of Ulster Scots.\n\nScots, mainly Gaelic-speaking, had been settling in Ulster since the 15th century, but large numbers of Scots-speaking Lowlanders, some 200,000, arrived during the 17th century following the 1610 Plantation, with the peak reached during the 1690s. In the core areas of Scots settlement, Scots outnumbered English settlers by five or six to one.\n\nLiterature from shortly before the end of the unselfconscious tradition at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries is almost identical with contemporary writing from Scotland. W. G. Lyttle, writing in \"Paddy McQuillan's Trip Tae Glesco\", uses the typically Scots forms \"kent\" and \"begood\", now replaced in Ulster by the more mainstream Anglic forms \"knew\", \"knowed\" or \"knawed\" and \"begun\". Many of the modest contemporary differences between Scots as spoken in Scotland and Ulster may be due to dialect levelling and influence from Mid Ulster English brought about through relatively recent demographic change rather than direct contact with Irish, retention of older features or separate development.\n\nThe earliest identified writing in Scots in Ulster dates from 1571: a letter from Agnes Campbell of County Tyrone to Queen Elizabeth on behalf of Turlough O'Neil, her husband. Although documents dating from the Plantation period show conservative Scots features, English forms started to predominate from the 1620s as Scots declined as a written medium.\n\nIn Ulster Scots-speaking areas there was traditionally a considerable demand for the work of Scottish poets, often in locally printed editions. These include Alexander Montgomerie's \"The Cherrie and the Slae\" in 1700; shortly over a decade later an edition of poems by Sir David Lindsay; nine printings of Allan Ramsay's \"The Gentle shepherd\" between 1743 and 1793; and an edition of Robert Burns' poetry in 1787, the same year as the Edinburgh edition, followed by reprints in 1789, 1793 and 1800. Among other Scottish poets published in Ulster were James Hogg and Robert Tannahill.\nThat was complemented by a poetry revival and nascent prose genre in Ulster, which started around 1720. The most prominent of these was the \"rhyming weaver\" poetry, of which, some 60 to 70 volumes were published between 1750 and 1850, the peak being in the decades 1810 to 1840, although the first printed poetry (in the Habbie stanza form) by an Ulster Scots writer was published in a broadsheet in Strabane in 1735. These weaver poets looked to Scotland for their cultural and literary models and were not simple imitators but clearly inheritors of the same literary tradition following the same poetic and orthographic practices; it is not always immediately possible to distinguish traditional Scots writing from Scotland and Ulster. Among the \"rhyming weavers\" were James Campbell (1758–1818), James Orr (1770–1816), Thomas Beggs (1749–1847), David Herbison (1800–1880), Hugh Porter (1780–1839) and Andrew McKenzie (1780–1839).\n\nScots was also used in the narrative by Ulster novelists such as W. G. Lyttle (1844–1896) and Archibald McIlroy (1860–1915). By the middle of the 19th century the \"Kailyard school\" of prose had become the dominant literary genre, overtaking poetry. This was a tradition shared with Scotland which continued into the early 20th century. Scots also frequently appeared in Ulster newspaper columns, especially in Antrim and Down, in the form of pseudonymous social commentary employing a folksy first-person style. The pseudonymous Bab M'Keen (probably successive members of the Weir family: John Weir, William Weir, and Jack Weir) provided comic commentaries in the \"Ballymena Observer and County Antrim Advertiser\" for over a hundred years from the 1880s.\nA somewhat diminished tradition of vernacular poetry survived into the 20th century in the work of poets such as Adam Lynn, author of the 1911 collection \"Random Rhymes frae Cullybackey\", John Stevenson (died 1932), writing as \"Pat M'Carty\", and John Clifford (1900–1983) from East Antrim. In the late 20th century the poetic tradition was revived, albeit often replacing the traditional Modern Scots orthographic practice with a series of contradictory idiolects. Among the significant writers is James Fenton, mostly using a blank verse form, but also occasionally the Habbie stanza. He employs an orthography that presents the reader with the difficult combination of eye dialect, dense Scots, and a greater variety of verse forms than employed hitherto. The poet Michael Longley (born 1939) has experimented with Ulster Scots for the translation of Classical verse, as in his 1995 collection \"The Ghost Orchid\". The writing of Philip Robinson (born 1946) has been described as verging on \"post-modern kailyard\". He has produced a trilogy of novels \"Wake the Tribe o Dan\" (1998), \"The Back Streets o the Claw\" (2000) and \"The Man frae the Ministry\" (2005), as well as story books for children \"Esther, Quaen o tha Ulidian Pechts\" and \"Fergus an tha Stane o Destinie\", and two volumes of poetry \"Alang the Shore\" (2005) and \"Oul Licht, New Licht\" (2009).\n\nA team in Belfast has begun translating portions of the Bible into Ulster Scots. The Gospel of Luke was published in 2009 by the Ullans Press. It is available in the YouVersion Bible Project.\n\nIn 1992 the Ulster-Scots Language Society was formed for the protection and promotion of Ulster Scots, which some of its members viewed as a language in its own right, encouraging use in speech, writing and in all areas of life.\n\nWithin the terms of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages the British Government is obliged, among other things, to:\n\nThe Ulster-Scots Agency, funded by DCAL in conjunction with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is responsible for promotion of greater awareness and use of Ullans and of Ulster-Scots cultural issues, both within Northern Ireland and throughout the island. The agency was established as a result of the Belfast Agreement of 1998. Its headquarters are on Great Victoria Street in central Belfast, while the agency has a major office in Raphoe, County Donegal.\n\nIn 2001 the Institute of Ulster Scots Studies was established at the University of Ulster.\n\nAn Ulster Scots Academy has been planned with the aim of conserving, developing, and teaching the language of Ulster-Scots in association with native speakers to the highest academic standards.\n\n2010's documentary \"The Hamely Tongue\" by filmmaker Deaglán O Mocháin traces back the origins of this culture and language, and relates its manifestations in today's Ireland.\n\nBy the early 20th century the literary tradition was almost extinct, though some 'dialect' poetry continued to be written. Much revivalist Ulster Scots has appeared, for example as \"official translations\", since the 1990s. However, it has little in common with traditional Scots orthography as described in Grant and Dixon’s \"Manual of Modern Scots\" (1921). Aodán Mac Póilin, an Irish language activist, has described these revivalist orthographies as an attempt to make Ulster Scots an independent written language and to achieve official status. They seek \"to be as different to English (and occasionally Scots) as possible\". He described it as a hotchpotch of obsolete words, neologisms (example: \"stour-sucker\" for \"vacuum cleaner\"), redundant spellings (example: \"qoho\" for \"who\") and \"erratic spelling\". This spelling \"sometimes reflects everyday Ulster Scots speech rather than the conventions of either modern or historic Scots, and sometimes does not\". The result, Mac Póilin writes, is \"often incomprehensible to the native speaker\". In 2000, Dr John Kirk described the \"net effect\" of that \"amalgam of traditional, surviving, revived, changed, and invented features\" as an \"artificial dialect\". He added,It is certainly not a written version of the vestigial spoken dialect of rural County Antrim, as its activists frequently urge, perpetrating the fallacy that it’s \"wor ain leid\". (Besides, the dialect revivalists claim not to be native speakers of the dialect themselves!). The colloquialness of this new dialect is deceptive, for it is neither spoken nor innate. Traditional dialect speakers find it counter-intuitive and false...\n\nIn 2005, Gavin Falconer questioned officialdom's complicity, writing: \"The readiness of Northern Ireland officialdom to consign taxpayers’ money to a black hole of translations incomprehensible to ordinary users is worrying\". Recently produced teaching materials, have, on the other hand, been evaluated more positively.\n\nThe three text excerpts below illustrate how the traditional written form of Ulster Scots from the 18th to early 20th century was virtually indistinguishable from contemporary written Scots from Scotland.\n\n\"The Muse Dismissed\" (Hugh Porter 1780–1839)\n\n\"To M.H.\" (Barney Maglone 1820?–1875)\n\nFrom \"The Lammas Fair\" (Robert Huddleston 1814–1889)\n\nThe examples below illustrate how 21st century Ulster Scots texts seldom adhere to the previous literary tradition, \"Yer guide tae the cheenge-ower\", perhaps being a rare exception. Instead there has been an increase in the use of somewhat creative phonetic spellings based on the perceived sound-to-letter correspondences of Standard English, i.e. dialect writing, as exemplified in \"Alice's Carrànts in Wunnerlan\" or the adoption of a more esoteric \"amalgam of traditional, surviving, revived, changed, and invented features\" as exemplified in \"Hannlin Rede\".\n\nFrom \"Yer guide tae the cheenge-ower\" (digitaluk 2012)\n\nFrom \"Alice's Carrànts in Wunnerlan\" (Anne Morrison-Smyth, 2013)\n\nFrom \"Hannlin Rede\" [annual report] \"2012–2013\" (\"Männystèr o Fairms an Kintra Fordèrin\", 2012)\n\n\n"}

Also known as the Pareto-Zipf law, it is a power-law distribution on ranked data, named after the linguist George Kingsley Zipf who suggested a simpler distribution called Zipf's law, and the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who subsequently generalized it.\n\nThe probability mass function is given by:\n\nwhere formula_6 is given by:\n\nwhich may be thought of as a generalization of a harmonic number. In the formula, formula_8 is the rank of the data, and formula_9 and formula_10 are parameters of the distribution. In the limit as formula_11 approaches infinity, this becomes the Hurwitz zeta function formula_12. For finite formula_11 and formula_14 the Zipf–Mandelbrot law becomes Zipf's law. For infinite formula_11 and formula_14 it becomes a Zeta distribution.\n\nThe distribution of words ranked by their frequency in a random\ntext corpus is approximated by a power-law distribution, known\nas Zipf's law.\n\nIf one plots the frequency rank of words contained in a moderately sized corpus of text data versus the number of occurrences or actual frequencies, one obtains a power-law distribution, with exponent close to one (but see Powers, 1998 and Gelbukh & Sidorov, 2001). Zipf's law implicitly assumes a fixed vocabulary size, but the Harmonic series with \"s\"=1 does not converge, while the Zipf-Mandelbrot generalization with \"s\">1 does. Furthermore, there is evidence that the closed class of functional words that define a language obeys a Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution with different parameters from the open classes of contentive words that vary by topic, field and register.\n\nIn ecological field studies, the relative abundance distribution (i.e. the graph of the number of species observed as a function of their abundance) is often found to conform to a Zipf–Mandelbrot law.\n\nWithin music, many metrics of measuring \"pleasing\" music conform to Zipf–Mandelbrot distributions.\n\n\n"}
