It forms a subgroup with the Tariana, Piapoco, Resígaro and Guarequena languages. There are 10,000 speakers.\n\nAikhenvald (1999) considers the three main varieties to be dialects; Kaufman (1994) considers them to be distinct languages, in a group he calls \"Karu\". They are:\n\nVarious (sub)dialects of all three are called \"Tapuya\". All are spoken by the Baniwa people. Ruhlen lists all as \"Izaneni\"; Greenberg's \"Adzánani\" (= Izaneni) presumably belongs here.\n\nBaniwa has active–stative alignment. This means that the subject of an intransitive clause is sometimes marked in the same way as the agent of a transitive clause, and sometimes marked in the same way as the patient of a transitive clause. In Baniwa alignment is realized through verbal agreement, namely prefixes and enclitics.\n\nPrefixes are used to mark:\nEnclitics are used to mark:\nThe differences between active and stative intransitive clauses can be illustrated below:\n\nBaniwa has an interesting system of noun classification that combines a gender system with a noun classifier system. Baniwa has two genders: feminine and nonfeminine. Feminine gender agreement is used to refer to female referents, whilst nonfeminine gender agreement is used for all other referents. The two genders are only distinguished in third person singular. Aihkenvald (2007) considers the bipartite gender system to be inherited from Proto-Arawak.\n\nIn addition to gender, Baniwa also has 46 classifiers. Classifiers are used in three main contexts:\nAihkenvald (2007) divides Baniwa classifiers into four different classes. One set of classifiers is used for humans, animate beings and body parts. Another set of classifiers specify the shape, consistency, quantification or specificity of the noun. Two more classes can be distinguished. One is only used with numerals and the other is only used with adjectives.\n\nClassifiers for Humans and animate beings:\n\nClassifiers according to shape, consistency, quantification and specificity:\nThere are two main strategies for negation in the Kurripako-Baniwa varieties:\nDifferent varieties have different negative markers. This is so prominent that speakers identify Kurripako dialects according to the words for 'yes' and 'no'. \n\nThe independent negative markers come before the verb. They are used as clausal negators in declarative and interrogative sentences. They are also used to link clauses.\n\nThe privative suffix is attached to nouns to derive a verb which means 'lacking' the noun from which it was derived. The opposite of the privative prefix is the attributive prefix \"ka-\". This derives a verb which means 'having' the noun from which it was derived. The difference can be illustrated below:\nThe prefix is used in combination with the restrictive suffix \"-tsa\" to form negative imperatives, e.g. ma-ihnia-tsa 'don't eat!'. A privative prefix is also reconstructed in Proto-Arawak privative as \"*ma-.\"\n\nGranadillo (2014) considers Kurripako a VOS language.\n\nBaniva del Guainia Language\n"}

He translated 81 books, mostly from English and a few from French literature into Persian. He has also authored more than 10 books. Although he was writing in Persian language, many of his books have been written in the Kurdish context and topics. In 1949 in Tehran he went to military school and become a lieutenant. After Mohammad Mosaddegh was overthrown in a coup d'état in 1955 he was fired from the Iranian army and sentenced to death. However, he was forgiven and eventually spent 8 years in jail under the Pahlavi regime (Shah). After jail he went to a higher school of economy and received a doctorate of philosophy from the Sorbonne in 1978 in Economy.\n\nBrayim wrote an autobiography in 2005, collecting memories from the beginning of his life, and marking challenging issues in his life in a beautifully written novel called \"Winter and no spring after\" (زمستان بي بهار). In his book, he described the way of living for Kurdish people in the 1920s in his hometown in Bane which is a very small town hidden in the beautiful Zagros Mountains. Using memories in the book can also track events in the 20th century in Iran.\n\nHe started his first translation about half a century ago by translating the novel \"Great Expectations\" from Charles Dickens. He introduced many of the most important novels from western literature for the first time into Persian:\n\"Literature and Western man\" by Priestley, John Boynton and \"Aspects of the Novel\" by E. M. Forster.\nHowever his writings are not only limited to literature. He also published books in history and politics. His very important publications on the Kurds and Kurdistan are among the most respected books in Kurdology. For example: \"A Modern History of the Kurds: Third Edition\" by David McDowall and \"KURDS TURKS & ARABS\" by C. J.

In particular, Compressed Sensing can be used to reconstruct a sparse vector from a smaller number of measurements, provided the signal can be represented in sparse domain. By \"sparse domain\" is meant a domain in which only a few measurements have non-zero values. \n\nSuppose a signal formula_1 can be represented in a domain where only formula_2 coefficients out of formula_3 (where formula_4) are non zero, then the signal is said to be sparse in that domain.\nThis reconstructed sparse vector can be used to construct back the original signal if the sparse domain of signal is known. CS can be applied to speech signal only if sparse domain of speech signal is known.\n\nConsider a speech signal formula_5, which can be represented in a domain formula_6 such that formula_7, where speech signal formula_8, dictionary matrix formula_9 and the sparse coefficient vector formula_10. This speech signal is said to be sparse in domain formula_6, if the number of significant (non zero) coefficients in sparse vector formula_12 is formula_13, where formula_14.\n\nThe observed signal formula_15 is of dimension formula_16. To reduce the complexity for solving formula_12 using CS speech signal is observed using a measurement matrix formula_18 such that\nwhere formula_19, and measurement matrix formula_20 such that formula_21.\nSparse decomposition problem for eq. 1 can be solved as standard formula_22 minimization as\n\nIf measurement matrix formula_18 satisfies the restricted isometric property (RIP) and is incoherent with dictionary matrix formula_6. then the reconstructed signal is much closer to the original speech signal.\nDifferent types of measurement matrices like random matrices can be used for speech signals.\nEstimating the sparsity of a speech signal is a problem since the speech signal varies greatly over time and thus sparsity of speech signal also varies highly over time. If sparsity of speech signal can be calculated over time without much complexity that will be best. If this is not possible then worst-case scenario for sparsity can be considered for a given speech signal.\nSparse vector (formula_25) for a given speech signal is reconstructed from as small as possible a number of measurements (formula_26) using formula_22 minimization. Then original speech signal is reconstructed form the calculated sparse vector formula_25 using the fixed dictionary matrix as formula_6 as formula_30 = formula_6formula_25. \nEstimation of both the dictionary matrix and sparse vector from random measurements only has been done iteratively.\nThe speech signal reconstructed from estimated sparse vector and dictionary matrix is much closer to the original signal.\nSome more iterative approaches to calculate both dictionary matrix and speech signal from just random measurements of speech signal have been developed.\n\nThe application of structured sparsity for joint speech localization-separation in reverberant acoustics has been investigated for multiparty speech recognition. Further applications of the concept of sparsity are yet to be studied in the field of speech processing. The idea behind applying CS to speech signals is to formulate algorithms or methods that use only those random measurements (formula_33) to carry out various forms of application-based processing such as speaker recognition and speech enhancement.\n"}

Slobin has made major contributions to the study of children's language acquisition, and his work has demonstrated the importance of cross-linguistic comparison for the study of language acquisition and psycholinguistics in general.\n\nDan (not 'Daniel') Slobin received a B.A. in psychology from the University of Michigan in 1960 and a Ph.D. in social psychology from Harvard University in 1964. In addition to working at the University of California, Berkeley, Slobin has served as a visiting professor at several universities around the world, including Boğaziçi University, Tel-Aviv University, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and Stanford University.\n\nSlobin has extensively studied the organization of information about spatial relations and motion events by speakers of different languages, including both children and adults. He has argued that becoming a competent speaker of a language requires learning certain language-specific modes of thinking, which he dubbed \"thinking for speaking\". Slobin's \"thinking for speaking\" view can be described as a contemporary, moderate version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, which claims that the language we learn shapes the way we perceive reality and think about it. This view is often contrasted with the \"language acquisition device\" view of Noam Chomsky and others, who think of language acquisition as a process largely independent of learning and cognitive development.\n\nDan Slobin did a research study, published in 2007, titled the \"Children use canonical sentence schemas: A crosslinguistic study of word order and inflections.\" The aim of the study was to show that we must not generalize that the acquiring of English language in children is the same as the acquiring of \"x\" languages. Slobin proposed that children \"construct a canonical sentence schema as a preliminary organizing structure for language behaviour. This canonical sentence schemas provide a functional explanation for the order of words and inflectional strategies based on each child's attempt to quickly master basic communication skills in his or her languages.\"\n\nFor the experiment, Dan Slobin modified an existing method—the task-comparison research methods where he provided the \"design for the testing of 48 children (three girls and three boys in each of the eight age groups: 2;0, 2;4, 2;8, 3;0, 3;4, 3;8, 4;0, 4;4). In the task, each child was presented with a pair of toy animals or dolls and was asked to demonstrate an action of one object upon the other. For example: \"Here's a camel. Let's think of a little story about him. How about, 'the camel is sleeping'. Can you show me what that would be like?\" Over the ten-day period, each child received three different kinds of the test. There were 18 verbs and 18 forms of the test allowing for permutations of word order and case inflections. The results is presented in table forms showing percentages of first-choice in all four languages by order of choice, whether it is Subject-Object, Noun-Object, etc. The most significant data gathered from the results was that Turkish children perform extremely accurate on all the grammatical sentences, even from the youngest age. Overall, the Turkish subjects perform better than children learning other languages. \"The English and Italian children in the younger ages perform at an intermediate level and the Serbo-Croatian children had the greatest difficulty.\"\n\nSlobin believes that language is acquired and is a learning as well as cognitive development in a child. His choice of method is the result of his theoretical stance where in task-comparison activity, his subjects get exposed to a consistent variety of tests, administered differently over a period of ten days. In task-comparison, his subjects get to perform or answer questions by displaying the instructions given.\n\nHis research generally showed that \"children seemed prepared to learn both inflectional and word-order languages\". His results contradicted his assumptions of \"earlier expectations based on the alleged naturalness of fixed word order, the acquisition of Turkish is not at all impaired by the fact that word order is not a cue for semantic relations since all languages differ from one another on a range of dimensions\". That is to say, \"one can't make generalizations about the acquisition of English as simply as an example of acquisition of a particular \"type\" of language\". Slobin successfully displayed this with the experiment results. However, his subjects were mainly from different European countries as well as North America and none from any parts of the Asian continent countries. His other work, The frog-story project, gained recognition worldwide.\n\nDan Slobin also designed a project, along with Ruth Berman in the beginning of 1980. He created \"The frog-story project\", a research tool which was a children's storybook that tells a story in 24 pictures with no words. This makes it possible to elicit narratives that are comparable in content but differing in form, across age and languages. There is now data from dozens of languages and most of the world's major language types. The Berman & Slobin study compared English, German, Spanish, Hebrew and Turkish on a range of dimensions.\n\nHis project was also mentioned in Raphael Berthele, a professor in the University of Fribourg, Switzerland on her work in the \"Crosslinguistic approaches to the psychology approach\" by Elena Lieven, Jiansheng Guo.\n\n"}

Cornell is an emerita Professor of Political Science, Comparative Literature and Women’s & Gender Studies at Rutgers University the State University of New Jersey; Professor Extraordinaire at the University of Pretoria, South Africa; and a visiting professor at Birkbeck College, University of London. \n\nShe received her Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Philosophy and Mathematics from Antioch College in 1978, and her Juris Doctor (J.D.) from University of California Los Angeles Law School in 1981.\n\nAll of Cornell’s diverse work is dedicated to thinking the possibility of a more just future through political and legal philosophy, feminism, and critical theory. Cornell is perhaps best known for her numerous interventions into feminist legal philosophy: \"Beyond Accommodation: Ethical Feminism, Deconstruction and the Law\" (1991); \"Transformations: Recollective Imagination and Sexual Difference\" (1993); \"The Imaginary Domain: Abortion, Pornography and Sexual Harassment\" (1995); and \"At The Heart of Freedom: Feminism, Sex, and Equality\" (1998). In these texts, Cornell moves beyond feminist debates over formal equality, sexuate rights, and essentialism to develop the original concepts of “ethical feminism” and “the imaginary domain” which position feminism as a fundamentally ethical project oriented toward the re-imagination of sexual difference through law, politics and aesthetics. Cornell is also widely known for her highly influential work in deconstruction, most notably \"The Philosophy of the Limit\" (1992), in which she famously renames deconstruction “the philosophy of the limit,” and argues for the political and ethical significance of Jacques Derrida’s work. These attempts to rethink law and jurisprudence as the opening of the possibility of justice led Cornell to her later works: \"Just Cause: Freedom, Identity and Rights\" (2000); \"Defending Ideals: War, Democracy, and Political Struggles\" (2004); \"Moral Images of Freedom: A Future for Critical Theory\" (2008); and \"Symbolic Forms for a New Humanity: Cultural and Racial Reconfigurations of Critical Theory\" (co-authored with Kenneth Michael Panfilio, 2010). These texts draw upon feminist, race, and critical theory to argue for the importance of imagination and symbolic forms in the project of freedom, the preservation of dignity, and creating a new future for humanity. Cornell’s interest in the aesthetic is further brought out in \"Between Women and Generations: Legacies of Dignity\" (2004) and \"Clint Eastwood and Issues of American Masculinity\" (2009). In these texts she explores film and women’s personal narrative as crucial sites for the aesthetic reconfiguration of what it means to be human, both individually and collectively. Finally, Cornell’s work in South Africa with the uBuntu Project has led to her most recent works \"uBuntu and the Law: African Ideals and Postapartheid Jurisprudence\" (co-edited with Nyoko Muvangua, 2011) and \"Law and Revolution in South Africa: uBuntu, Dignity and the Struggle for Constitutional Transformation\" (2014). Here, Cornell explores the role of indigenous values, especially uBuntu, in the law, politics and ethics of the new South Africa. This work in South Africa continues to build on Cornell’s career-long project of reimagining law as a force of revolutionary ethical transformation by looking beyond the Euro-American intellectual tradition. The depth and range of Cornell’s visionary work has led to her being called “one of the last grand critical theorists of our time.” \n\nShe played a key role in organizing the conference on deconstruction and justice at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in 1989, 1990, and 1993—a conference at which Jacques Derrida is thought by many to have made his definitive philosophical turn towards ethical thought.\n\nHer first play, produced in 1989, was a dramatic adaptation of \"Finnegans Wake\" which continues to be performed on Bloomsday. Her other plays, 'The Dream Cure', 'Background Interference', and 'Lifeline', have been produced in New York and other cities including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Boca Rotan, Florida, and Cape Town, South Africa. She has also produced a documentary film on the African humanist ethic of uBuntu, entitled \"uBuntu Hokae\".\n\nThe \"Imaginary Domain\" refers to the legal and moral ideal that was named to protect the psychic space necessary to rework individual sexual difference, sexuate being, racialized and ethnic identifications, as well as any other complex fantasies of personhood.\n\nDrucilla Cornell coined the phrase the imaginary domain in the book by the same name in 1995. The phrase was originally intended to intervene in feminist debates that had become acrimonious about whether women or any other identity could appeal to established identities as the basis of right. Cornell argued that it was possible to defend a practical ideal of the imaginary domain without having to resolve these particular debates, since as a moral or legal right, it was the person who was given the imagined space to recreate and re-symbolize all of his or her identifications. Thus, the imaginary domain did not fall into notions of right as necessarily inscribing victim identities or states of injury, since at least at the level of fantasy, the person is protected as the site of her own identifying configurations.\n\nFrom 2008 to the end of 2009, Professor Cornell held the National Research Foundation Chair in Customary Law, Indigenous Values, and the Dignity Jurisprudence at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. She founded the uBuntu project in 2003, and continues to be the co-director of that project with Chuma Himonga. She is also a co-director of the uBuntu Township Project, with Madoda Sigonyela. Professor Cornell is an advocate and researcher for Khulamani, an on the ground organisation of people who suffered under apartheid and are now struggling to find new and creative ways to counter the devastation that remains because of the system of racialized capitalism. The uBuntu Project is publishing several books. The first, \"uBuntu and the Law: Indigenous Ideals and Postapartheid Jurisprudence\", was published by Fordham University Press in 2012. The second, \"The Dignity Jurisprudence of the South African Constitutional Court\", is forthcoming in the fall of 2012, also from Fordham Press.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Effectuation includes a set of decision-making principles expert entrepreneurs are observed to employ in situations of uncertainty.\nSituations of uncertainty are situations in which the future is unpredictable, goals are not clearly known and there is no independent environment that serves as the ultimate selection mechanism.\n\nEffectuation is a principle introduced by Saras Sarasvathy in 2001. Since 1997 Sarasvathy conducted a research among 45 expert entrepreneurs. Sarasvathy interviewed the entrepreneurs and let them solve cases in order to see how they think and where they start. It appeared that 89% of the expert entrepreneurs used effectuation more often than causation. Causation is the opposite of effectuation. Where effectuation is used in situations of uncertainty, causal reasoning is used when the future is predictable. With causal reasoning, entrepreneurs will determine goals to achieve and look for the resources to do so. At the opposite with effectuation, entrepreneurs will determine goals according to the resources in their possession.\n\nThere are five core principles that define Effectual Logic. These are:\n\nThe most simple and clear example Saras Sarasvathy gives to describe effectual reasoning and to distinguish effectual reasoning from causation is about a chef cooking a meal.\nBy using causation, the client chooses a menu in advance and the chef prepares this menu by looking for the right ingredients and following the recipes to make the dishes. In the effectual process, the approach would be rather different. The client would not ask for a specific menu, but he asks the chef to make something with the ingredients available. The chef chooses one of the many different meals he is able to make with the available ingredients.\n\nThe most important difference between causal reasoning and effectuation is therefore that an entrepreneur using causation has a given goal and searches for means to reach his goal. If the entrepreneur uses effectuation instead, he will start with the means he has and from this point he looks at possible goals.\n\n\n"}

Croot's result follows as a corollary of a more general theorem stating the existence of Egyptian fraction representations of unity for sets \"C\" of smooth numbers in intervals of the form [\"X\", \"X\"], where \"C\" contains sufficiently many numbers so that the sum of their reciprocals is at least six. The Erdős–Graham conjecture follows from this result by showing that one can find an interval of this form in which the sum of the reciprocals of all smooth numbers is at least 6\"r\"; therefore, if the integers are \"r\"-colored there must be a monochromatic subset \"C\" satisfying the conditions of Croot's theorem.\n\n\n\n"}

His first novel, \"Village in Uhuru\", was published in 1969. He has written several subsequent novels in Swahili. He has also taught literature at a number of universities, and is currently a professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Georgia in the USA.\n\nRuhumbika was born in 1938 on Ukerewe Island in Lake Victoria. After studying for an undergraduate degree at the Makerere University in Uganda, he completed a PhD in African literature at the University of Paris-Sorbonne in France.\n\nRuhumbika's first novel, \"Village in Uhuru\", was published in 1969; this was the second English-language Tanzanian novel, after Peter Palangyo's \"Dying in the Sun\" (1968). This is a historical novel, based on real events relating to questions of ethnic and national identity in the context of the Tanganyika African National Union's struggles for sovereignty in Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Although \"Village in Uhuru\" was written and first published in English, Ruhumbika decided to write all of his subsequent novels in Swahili, a decision similar to that of Kenyan writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o.\n\nHis Swahili-language novels, which mainly cover the Pan-African Uhuru Movement, include \"Miradi Bubu ya Wazalendo\" (\"Invisible Enterprises of the Patriots\", 1991) and \"Janga Sugu la Wazawa\" (\"Everlasting Doom for the Children of the Land\", 2002). He also wrote a collection of short stories, \"Uwike Usiwike Kutakuche\" (\"Whether the Cock Crows or Not It Dawns\"). Outside of his own writings, he has worked as a translator, mainly from French to Swahili, although he also translated Aniceti Kitereza's novel \"Myombekere and His Wife Bugonoka, Their Son Ntulanalwo, and Daughter Bulihwali\" from Kikerewe into English.\n\nRuhumbika has also taught literature at various universities, in both Africa and the USA. He has lectured at the University of Dar es Salaam (from 1970 to 1985) and Hampton University in Virginia (from 1985 to 1992).

Le Feuvre\n\nGeorge Francis Le Feuvre, who wrote under the pen-names of \"George d'La Forge\" and \"Bouanhomme George\", was a Jèrriais prose author born at La Forge, Millais, Saint Ouen, Jersey, on 29 September 1891 and died in San Antonio, Texas, on 27 October 1984.\n\nHe took his pen-name from the family forge where his father, also called George Le Feuvre, carried on his trade as blacksmith and with his wife, Florence Giffard brought up their family. George attended Mabel Mauger's dame school in Saint Ouen from the age of 6. It was there that he first started learning English and French. He moved on to St Ouen's Wesleyan School. The Le Feuvre family was separated in 1901 when George senior, Florence, and their two younger sons, Sidney and John, emigrated to Jersey's cod-fishing settlements at the Gaspé coast in Canada. George junior was left behind with his brother Frank and their grandparents, so that, should the ship be lost during the ocean crossing at least two boys would be left as survivors. In 1903, his grandfather died and the forge was sold. George went to live with his godparents in Saint Brelade, and attended La Moye School. George left school at age 14 to go to work in the offices of solicitor William Binet in Saint Helier. He continued working in the legal environment and was appointed Commis Vicomte for the Police and Petty Debts Court in 1914.\n\nAs a young man, he took part in amateur dramatic productions, including works by E. J. Luce.\n\nHe served as secretary to the Connétable of Saint Peter, and served in the North-West Battalion of the Royal Militia 1908-1915. In 1916 he enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery and saw action on the Western Front of the First World War. Although he devoted many pieces of writing to his proud memories of peacetime military service in the Militia, in contrast he avoided describing, except in passing, his experiences in the First World War in the battles of the Somme, Vimy Ridge, Messines Ridge and Cambrai.\n\nIn 1916 he married Marguerite Adrienne Jeanne Marie Forgeard, stepdaughter of a French army captain. They had one daughter, Reine, born in 1917. Marguerite died during the influenza pandemic, in March 1919. George never remarried, and remained a single man for the rest of his life.\n\nDemobilised in 1919, and having no family ties remaining in Jersey, he decided to join the rest of his family in Canada. He had met his three brothers during the war, when he, Frank (who had signed up for the British Army) and his two other brothers (who had enlisted in Canada) were briefly reunited. The brothers had sworn to meet up again if they survived the war, and George had heard about their life in Canada and the brothers and sisters he had never seen who had been born there. He later explained to his readers that although he loved Jersey so much, the experience of meeting his brothers on the battlefield had inspired him to rejoin his family. Unable to find a civil service post in Quebec, George joined the civil service in Ottawa.\n\nIn 1922, in search of new opportunities, he moved to Detroit in the United States where he joined the Ford Motor Company, first as a nightwatchman. He worked his way up the administration at the Great Lakes Engineering Works. During the course of his employment he learned to fly.\n\nIn 1933 he was naturalised as a United States citizen. In 1936 he was appointed purchasing director for Ford's sites in Michigan and Ohio. After the end of the war, at the age of 55, he decided to take retirement in 1946 and travel.\n\nRevisiting Jersey in 1946, he was offered the post of editor of the last French language newspaper in Jersey, Les Chroniques de Jersey. Wishing to be free of commitments that would tie him down, he turned down the offer, but agreed to provide a weekly column in Jèrriais from wherever he happened to be.\n\nIn subsequent decades, George established a pattern of spending part of the year in North America and the rest staying with friends in Jersey and indulging his love of travel. He eventually acquired a house in Jersey, Le Ménage ès Feuvres, that used to belong to his family until sold after the death of his great-uncle Charles. He undertook a renovation of the property and moved in in 1965. He continued to divide his time between Jersey and North America - Ottawa and Michigan to visit his brothers, Fort Lauderdale in Florida where he maintained a home, and San Antonio, Texas, home to his granddaughter.\n\nThe occasion of his 90th birthday in 1981 was marked with a dinner given in his honour by Le Don Balleine, and a celebratory mass in the chapel of Saint Ouen's Manor. The Jersey Evening Post celebrated the 900th column published in that newspaper in 1982. On 22 March 1984 he was elected a \"Membre d'Honneur\" of La Société Jersiaise. He died in a nursing home in San Antonio on 27 October 1984.\n\nFor almost forty years he maintained a flow of articles in Jèrriais back to Jersey for publication in newspapers, first in \"Les Chroniques de Jersey\" (1946–1954) and later in the \"Evening Post\" (subsequently \"Jersey Evening Post\" ) (1964–1984). Selections of his articles were published in book form as \"Jèrri Jadis\" (1973) and \"Histouaithes et Gens d'Jèrri\" (1976).\n\nHis first column for Les Chroniques de Jersey was published on 23 November 1946. Articles appeared weekly, or nearly weekly, until the end of 1951. In 1952-1954 articles relating George's travels appeared sporadically. A final article in Les Chroniques de Jersey, an appreciation of the newspaper, appeared in its final issue on 30 December 1959.\n\nIn 1953 George became the first secretary of L'Assembliée d'Jèrriais, founded to promote the Jersey language. Between 1952-1977 he was a regular contributor to its quarterly magazine Lé Bulletîn d'Quart d'An.\n\nOn the death in 1964 of writer Edward Le Brocq, whose weekly column in Jèrriais had transferred from Les Chroniques de Jersey on its closure at the end of 1959 to the Evening Post, George took up the rôle of providing a weekly column.\n\nThe publication of \"Jèrri Jadis\" resulted in the award of the Prix Littéraire du Cotentin to George in 1974.\n\nOn 13 January 1981, the Jersey Evening Post celebrated the 800th article by George published in that newspaper: \"Eight hundred articles, each of about 800 words and delivered regularly from wherever he happens to be (which is usually America, where he has lived for many years) is a remarkable achievement.\" And when the milestone of the 900th article appeared (on 5 August 1983), the Jersey Evening Post described him as \"Jersey heritage's most remarkable guardian\".\n\nFrom 14 April 1982, George's articles in Jèrriais were accompanied in the Jersey Evening Post by a parallel translation into English. His last article was published on 26 October 1984.\n\n"}

The only exception within German-speaking Switzerland is the municipality of Samnaun where an Austro-Bavarian dialect is spoken.\n\nGerman is the sole official language in 17 Swiss cantons (Aargau, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft, Glarus, Lucerne, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Uri, Zug, and Zurich). French and German are co-official in 3 cantons (Bern, Fribourg, and Valais). In the trilingual canton of Graubünden, more than half the population speaks German, while most of the rest speak one of the other official languages, Romansh and Italian.\n\nWhile the French-speaking Swiss prefer to call themselves \"Romands\" and their part of the country \"la Romandie\", the German-speaking Swiss used to refer to (and, colloquially, still do) the French-speaking Swiss as \"Welsche\", and to their area as \"Welschland\", which has the same etymology as the English (see \"Walha\"). In Germany \"Welsch\" and \"Welschland\" refer to Italy; there, the term is antiquated, rarely used, and somewhat disparaging.\n\nBy the Middle Ages, a marked difference had developed between the rural cantons of the German-speaking part of Switzerland and the city cantons, divided by views about trade and commerce. After the Reformation, all cantons were either Catholic or Protestant, and the denominational influences on culture added to the differences. Even today, where all cantons are somewhat denominationally mixed, the different historical denominations can be seen in the mountain villages, where Roman Catholic Central Switzerland abounds with chapels and statues of saints, and the farm houses in the very similar landscape of the Protestant Bernese Oberland show Bible verses carved on the housefronts, instead.\n\n"}

{"id": "42538288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42538288", "title": "Hangul", "text": "Hangul\n\nThe Korean alphabet, known as Hangul ( ; from Korean ) has been used to write the Korean language since its creation in the 15th century by Sejong the Great. It may also be written following the standard Romanization.\n\nIt is the official writing system of North Korea and South Korea. It is a co-official writing system in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County in Jilin Province, China. It is sometimes used to write the Cia-Cia language spoken near the town of Bau-Bau, Indonesia.\n\nThe alphabet consists of 14 consonants and 10 vowels. Its letters are grouped into syllabic blocks, vertically and horizontally. For example, the Korean word for \"honeybee\" (\"kkulbeol\") is written , not . As it combines the features of alphabetic and syllabic writing systems, it has been described as an \"alphabetic syllabary\" by some linguists. As in traditional Chinese writing, Korean texts were traditionally written top to bottom, right to left, and are occasionally still written this way for stylistic purposes. Today, it is typically written from left to right with spaces between words and western-style punctuation.\n\nSome linguists consider it among the most phonologically faithful writing systems in use today. One interesting feature of Hangul is that the shapes of its consonants seemingly mimic the shapes of the speaker's mouth when pronouncing each consonant.\n\nThe Korean alphabet was originally called Hunminjeong'eum (), after the document that introduced the script to the Korean people in 1446.\n\nNorth Koreans call the Korean alphabet Chosŏn'gŭl () after Chosŏn, the North Korean name for Korea. The McCune–Reischauer system is used there.\n\nToday, South Koreans call the Korean alphabet \"hangeul\" (), a name coined by Korean linguist Ju Si-gyeong in 1912. The name combines the ancient Korean word \"han\" (), meaning \"great\", and \"geul\" (), meaning \"script\". The word \"han\" is used to refer to Korea in general, so the name also means \"Korean script\". It has been romanized in multiple ways:\n\nUntil the early 20th century, the Korean elite preferred to write using Chinese characters called Hanja. They referred to Hanja as \"jinseo\" (진서) or \"true letters\". Some accounts say the elite referred to the Korean alphabet derisively as 'amkeul\" (암클) meaning \"women's script\", and 'ahaetgeul\" (아햇글) meaning \"children's script\", though there is no written evidence of this.\n\nSupporters of the Korean alphabet referred to it as \"jeong'eum\" (정음) meaning \"correct pronunciation\", \"gunkmun\" (국문) meaning \"national script\", and \"'eonmun\" (언문) meaning \"vernacular script\".\n\nBefore the creation of the new Korean alphabet, Koreans primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate the modern Korean alphabet by hundreds of years, including Idu script, Hyangchal, Gugyeol and Gakpil. However, due to fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and the large number of characters, many lower class Koreans were illiterate. To promote literacy among the common people, the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty, Sejong the Great, personally created and promulgated a new alphabet.\n\nThe Korean alphabet was designed so that people with little education could learn to read and write. A popular saying about the alphabet is, \"A wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over; even a stupid man can learn them in the space of ten days.\"\nThe project was completed in late December 1443 or January 1444, and described in 1446 in a document titled \"Hunminjeong'eum\" (\"The Proper Sounds for the Education of the People\"), after which the alphabet itself was originally named. The publication date of the \"Hunminjeongeum\", October 9, became Hangul Day in South Korea. Its North Korean equivalent, Chosŏn'gŭl Day, is on January 15.\n\nAnother document published in 1446 and titled \"Hunminjeong'eum Haerye\" (\"\"Hunminjeong'eum\" Explanation and Examples\") was discovered in 1940. This document explains that the design of the consonant letters is based on articulatory phonetics and the design of the vowel letters are based on the principles of \"yin\" and \"yang\" and vowel harmony.\n\nThe Korean alphabet faced opposition in the 1440s by the literary elite, including politician Choe Manri and other Korean Confucian scholars. They believed Hanja was the only legitimate writing system. They also saw the circulation of the Korean alphabet as a threat to their status. However, the Korean alphabet entered popular culture as King Sejong had intended, used especially by women and writers of popular fiction.\n\nKing Yeonsangun banned the study and publication of the Korean alphabet in 1504, after a document criticizing the king entered the public. Similarly, King Jungjong abolished the Ministry of Eonmun, a governmental institution related to Hangul research, in 1506.\n\nThe late 16th century, however, saw a revival of the Korean alphabet as \"gasa\" and \"sijo\" poetry flourished. In the 17th century, the Korean alphabet novels became a major genre. However, the use of the Korean alphabet had gone without standardisation for so long that spelling had become quite irregular.\n\nIn 1796, the Dutch scholar Isaac Titsingh became the first person to bring a book written in Korean to the West. His collection of books included the Japanese book, \"Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu\" (\"An Illustrated Description of Three Countries\") by Hayashi Shihei. This book, which was published in 1785, described the Joseon Kingdom and the Korean alphabet. In 1832, the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland supported the posthumous abridged publication of Titsingh's French translation.\n\nThanks to growing Korean nationalism, the Gabo Reformists' push, and Western missionaries' promotion of the Korean alphabet in schools and literature, the Korean alphabet was adopted in official documents for the first time in 1894. Elementary school texts began using the Korean alphabet in 1895, and \"Tongnip Sinmun\", established in 1896, was the first newspaper printed in both Korean and English.\n\nAfter the Japanese conquest, which occurred in 1910, Japanese was made the official language of Korea. However, the Korean alphabet was still taught in Korean-established schools built after the annexation and Korean was written in a mixed Hanja-Hangul script, where most lexical roots were written in Hanja and grammatical forms in the Korean alphabet. Japan banned earlier Korean literature from public schooling, which became mandatory for children.\n\nOrthography of the Korean alphabet was partially standardized in 1912, when the vowel \"arae'a\" ()–which has now disappeared from Korean–was restricted to Sino-Korean roots: the emphatic consonants were standardized to and final consonants restricted to . Long vowels were marked by a diacritic dot to the left of the syllable, but this was dropped in 1921.\n\nA second colonial reform occurred in 1930. The \"arae-a\" was abolished: the emphatic consonants were changed to and more final consonants were allowed, making the orthography more morphophonemic. The double-consonant was written alone (without a vowel) when it occurred between nouns, and the nominative particle was introduced after vowels, replacing .\n\nJu Si-gyeong, the linguist who had coined the term Hangul to replace \"Eonmun\" or \"Vulgar Script\" in 1912, established the Korean Language Research Society (later renamed the Hangul Society), which further reformed orthography with \"Standardized System of Hangul\" in 1933. The principal change was to make the Korean alphabet as morphophonemically practical given the existing letters. A system for transliterating foreign orthographies was published in 1940.\n\nHowever, Japan banned the Korean language from schools in 1938 as part of a policy of cultural assimilation, and all Korean-language publications were outlawed in 1941.\n\nThe definitive modern Korean alphabet orthography was published in 1946, just after Korean independence from Japanese rule. In 1948, North Korea attempted to make the script perfectly morphophonemic through the addition of new letters, and in 1953, Syngman Rhee in South Korea attempted to simplify the orthography by returning to the colonial orthography of 1921, but both reforms were abandoned after only a few years.\n\nBoth North Korea and South Korea have used the Korean alphabet or mixed script as their official writing system, with ever-decreasing use of Hanja. Beginning in the 1970s, Hanja began to experience a gradual decline in commercial or unofficial writing in the South due to government intervention, with some South Korean newspapers now only using Hanja as abbreviations or disambiguation of homonyms. There has been widespread debate as to the future of Hanja in South Korea. North Korea instated the Korean alphabet as its exclusive writing system in 1949, and banned the use of Hanja completely.\n\nWhile both North Korea and South Korea claim 99 percent literacy, a 2003 study found that 25 percent of those in the older generation in the South were not completely literate in the Korean alphabet.\n\nThe Hunminjeong'eum Society in Seoul attempts to spread the use of the Korean alphabet to unwritten languages of Asia. In 2009, the Korean alphabet was unofficially adopted by the town of Bau-Bau, in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, to write the Cia-Cia language. A number of Indonesian Cia-Cia speakers who visited Seoul generated large media attention in South Korea, and they were greeted on their arrival by Oh Se-hoon, the mayor of Seoul. It was confirmed in October 2012 that the attempts to disseminate the use of the Korean alphabet in Indonesia failed. Some people continue to use the Korean alphabet at home or co-officially.\n\n Letters in the Korean alphabet are called \"jamo\" (자모). There are 19 consonants and 21 vowels used in the modern alphabet. They are firstly named in Hunmongjahoe, a hanja textbook written by Choe Sejin.\n\nThe chart below shows all 19 consonants in South Korean alphabetic order with Revised Romanization equivalents for each letter and pronunciation in IPA (see Korean phonology for more).\n\nㅇ is silent syllable-initially and is used as a placeholder when the syllable starts with a vowel. ㄸ, ㅃ, and ㅉ are never used syllable-finally.\n\nConsonants in the Korean alphabet can be combined into 11 consonant clusters, which always appear in the final position in a syllable. They are: ㄳ, ㄵ, ㄶ, ㄺ, ㄻ, ㄼ, ㄽ, ㄾ, ㄿ, ㅀ, and ㅄ.\n\nThe chart below shows the 21 vowels used in the modern Korean alphabet in South Korean alphabetic order with Revised Romanization equivalents for each letter and pronunciation in IPA (see Korean phonology for more).\nAlphabetic order in the Korean alphabet is called the \"ganada\" order, () after the first three letters of the alphabet. The alphabetical order of the Korean alphabet does not mix consonants and vowels. Rather, first are velar consonants, then coronals, labials, sibilants, etc. The vowels come after the consonants.\n\nThe order from the \"Hunminjeong'eum\" in 1446 was:\n\nIn 1527, Choe Sejin reorganized the alphabet in Hunmongjahoe:\n\nThis is the basis of the modern alphabetic orders. It was before the development of the Korean tense consonants and the double letters that represent them, and before the conflation of the letters (') and (ng). Thus, when the North Korean and South Korean governments implemented full use of the Korean alphabet, they ordered these letters differently, with North Korea, placing new letters at the end of the alphabet and South Korea grouping similar letters together.\n\nThe new, double, letters are placed at the end of the consonants, just before the ' , so as not to alter the traditional order of the rest of the alphabet.\n\nAll digraphs and trigraphs, including the old diphthongs and , are placed after the simple vowels, again maintaining Choe's alphabetic order.\n\nThe order of the final letters is:\n\nUnlike when it is initial, this is pronounced, as the nasal \"ng,\" which occurs only as a final in the modern language. The double letters are placed to the very end, as in the initial order, but the combined consonants are ordered immediately after their first element.\n\nIn the Southern order, double letters are placed immediately after their single counterparts:\n\nThe modern monophthongal vowels come first, with the derived forms interspersed according to their form: \"i\" is added first, then iotized, then iotized with added \"i\". Diphthongs beginning with \"w\" are ordered according to their spelling, as or plus a second vowel, not as separate digraphs.\n\nThe order of the final letters () is:\n\nEvery syllable begins with a consonant (or the silent ㅇ) that is followed by a vowel (e.g. + = ). Some syllables such as \" and \" have a final consonant or final consonant cluster (). Then, 399 combinations are possible for \"two-letter syllables\" and 10,773 possible combinations for syllables with more than two \"letters\" (27 possible final endings), for a total of 11,172 possible combinations of Korean alphabet \"letters\" to form syllables.\n\nLetters in the Korean alphabet were named by Korean linguist Choe Sejin in 1527. South Korea uses Choe's traditional names, most of which follow the format of \"letter\" + \"i\" + \"eu\" + \"letter\". However, as the syllables \"euk\", \"eut\", and \"eut\" did not occur in the language, Choe gave those letters the modified names \"giyeok, \"digeut, and \"sieut\", using native syllables.\n\nOriginally, Choe gave , , , , , and the irregular one-syllable names of \"ji\", \"chi\", \"ḳi\", \"ṭi\", \"p̣i\", and \"hi\", because they should not be used as final consonants, as specified in \"Hunminjeong'eum\". However, after establishment of the new orthography in 1933, which let all consonants be used as finals, the names changed to the present forms.\n\nNorth Korea regularised Choe's original names when it made the Korean alphabet its official orthography.\n\nThe chart below shows names used in North Korea for consonants in the Korean alphabet. The letters are arranged in North Korean alphabetic order, and the letter names are romanised with the McCune-Reischauer system, which is widely used in North Korea. The tense consonants are described with the word \"toen\" meaning \"hard\".\n\nIn North Korea, an alternative way to refer to a consonant is \"letter\" + \"ŭ\" (), for example, gŭ () for the letter , and \"ssŭ\" () for the letter .\n\nAs in South Korea, the names of vowels in the Korean alphabet are the same as the sound of each vowel.\n\nThe chart below shows names used in South Korea for consonants of the Korean alphabet. The letters are arranged in the South Korean alphabetic order, and the letter names are romanised in the Revised Romanisation system, which is the official romanisation system of South Korea. The tense consonants are described with the word \"ssang\" meaning \"double\".\nLetters in the Korean alphabet have adopted certain rules of Chinese calligraphy, although and use a circle, which is not used in printed Chinese characters.\nFor the iotized vowels, which are not shown, the short stroke is simply doubled.\n\nScripts typically transcribe languages at the level of morphemes (logographic scripts like Hanja), of syllables (syllabaries like \"kana\"), of segments (alphabetic scripts like the Latin script used to write English and many other languages), or, on occasion, of distinctive features. The Korean alphabet incorporates aspects of the latter three, grouping sounds into syllables, using distinct symbols for segments, and in some cases using distinct strokes to indicate distinctive features such as place of articulation (labial, coronal, velar, or glottal) and manner of articulation (plosive, nasal, sibilant, aspiration) for consonants, and iotization (a preceding \"i-\"sound), harmonic class and i-mutation for vowels.\n\nFor instance, the consonant ṭ is composed of three strokes, each one meaningful: the top stroke indicates is a plosive, like \"ʔ\", \"g\", \"d\", \"j\", which have the same stroke (the last is an affricate, a plosive–fricative sequence); the middle stroke indicates that is aspirated, like \"h\", \"ḳ\", \"ch\", which also have this stroke; and the bottom stroke indicates that is alveolar, like \"n\", \"d\", and \"l\". (This element is said to represent the shape of the tongue when pronouncing coronal consonants, though this is not certain.) Two consonants, and , have dual pronunciations, and appear to be composed of two elements corresponding to these two pronunciations: ~silence for and ~ for obsolete .\n\nWith vowel letters, a short stroke connected to the main line of the letter indicates that this is one of the vowels that \"can\" be iotized; this stroke is then doubled when the vowel \"is\" iotized. The position of the stroke indicates which harmonic class the vowel belongs to, \"light\" (top or right) or \"dark\" (bottom or left). In the modern alphabet, an additional vertical stroke indicates i-mutation, deriving , , and from , , and . However, this is not part of the intentional design of the script, but rather a natural development from what were originally diphthongs ending in the vowel . Indeed, in many Korean dialects, including the standard dialect of Seoul, some of these may still be diphthongs. Note: as a morpheme is ㅓ combined with ㅣ as a vertical stroke. As a phoneme, its sound is not by i-mutation of .\n\nSome linguists have praised the Korean alphabet for its featural design; beyond the fact that the shapes of the letters are related to the features of the sounds they represent, the Korean alphabet also attracts approval for the fact that vowels are made from vertical or horizontal lines so that they are easily distinguishable from consonants.\n\nAlthough the design of the script may be featural, for all practical purposes it behaves as an alphabet. The letter is not read as three letters \"alveolar aspirated plosive\", for instance, but as a single consonant \"t\". Likewise, the former diphthong is read as a single vowel \"e\".\n\nBeside the letters, the Korean alphabet originally employed diacritic marks to indicate pitch accent. A syllable with a high pitch () was marked with a dot (ᅟᅠ〮) to the left of it (when writing vertically); a syllable with a rising pitch () was marked with a double dot, like a colon (ᅟᅠ〯). These are no longer used, as modern Seoul Korean has lost tonality. Vowel length has also been neutralized in Modern Korean, and is no longer written.\n\nThe consonant letters fall into five homorganic groups, each with a basic shape, and one or more letters derived from this shape by means of additional strokes. In the \"Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye\" account, the basic shapes iconically represent the articulations the tongue, palate, teeth, and throat take when making these sounds.\nThe Korean names for the groups are taken from Chinese phonetics:\n\nVowel letters are based on three elements:\n\n\nShort strokes (dots in the earliest documents) were added to these three basic elements to derive the vowel letter:\n\n\nThe Korean alphabet does not have a letter for \"w\" sound. Since an \"o\" or \"u\" before an \"a\" or \"eo\" became a sound, and occurred nowhere else, could always be analyzed as a phonemic \"o\" or \"u\", and no letter for was needed. However, vowel harmony is observed: \"dark\"  \"u\" with \"dark\"  \"eo\" for \"wo;\" \"bright\"  \"o\" with \"bright\"  \"a\" for \"wa\":\n\nThe compound vowels ending in \"i\" were originally diphthongs. However, several have since evolved into pure vowels:\n\n\nThere is no letter for \"y\". Instead, this sound is indicated by doubling the stroke attached to the baseline of the vowel letter. Of the seven basic vowels, four could be preceded by a \"y\" sound, and these four were written as a dot next to a line. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line: .) A preceding \"y\" sound, called \"iotization\", was indicated by doubling this dot: . The three vowels that could not be iotized were written with a single stroke: .\n\nThe simple iotized vowels are:\n\n\nThere are also two iotized diphthongs:\n\n\nThe Korean language of the 15th century had vowel harmony to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels in grammatical morphemes changed according to their environment, falling into groups that \"harmonized\" with each other. This affected the morphology of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of \"yin\" and \"yang\": If a root word had \"yang\" ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes attached to it also had to have \"yang\" vowels; conversely, if the root had \"yin\" ('dark') vowels, the suffixes had to be \"yin\" as well. There was a third harmonic group called \"mediating\" ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either \"yin\" or \"yang\" vowels.\n\nThe Korean neutral vowel was \"i\". The \"yin\" vowels were \"eu, u, eo\"; the dots are in the \"yin\" directions of 'down' and 'left'. The \"yang\" vowels were \"ə, o, a,\" with the dots in the \"yang\" directions of 'up' and 'right'. The \"Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye\" states that the shapes of the non-dotted letters were chosen to represent the concepts of \"yin\", \"yang\", and mediation: Earth, Heaven, and Human. (The letter \"ə\" is now obsolete except in the Jeju language.)\n\nThe third parameter in designing the vowel letters was choosing as the graphic base of and , and as the graphic base of and . A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15th century.\n\nThe uncertainty is primarily with the three letters . Some linguists reconstruct these as , respectively; others as . A third reconstruction is to make them all middle vowels as . With the third reconstruction, Middle Korean vowels actually line up in a vowel harmony pattern, albeit with only one front vowel and four middle vowels:\n\nHowever, the horizontal letters do all appear to have been mid to high back vowels, , and thus to have formed a coherent group phonetically in every reconstruction.\n\nThe generally accepted account on the design of the letters is that the vowels are derived from various combinations of the following three components: . Here, symbolically stands for the (sun in) heaven, stands for the (flat) earth, and stands for an (upright) human. The original sequence of the Korean vowels, as stated in Hunminjeongeum, listed these three vowels first, followed by various combinations. Thus, the original order of the vowels was: . Note that two positive vowels () including one are followed by two negative vowels including one , then by two positive vowels each including two of , and then by two negative vowels each including two of .\n\nThe same theory provides the most simple explanation of the shapes of the consonants as an approximation of the shapes of the most representative organ needed to form that sound. The original order of the consonants in Hunminjeong'eum was: .\n\nAlthough the \"Hunminjeong'eum Haerye\" explains the design of the consonantal letters in terms of articulatory phonetics, as a purely innovative creation, several theories suggest which external sources may have inspired or influenced King Sejong's creation. Professor Gari Ledyard of Columbia University studied possible connections between Hangul and the Mongol 'Phags-pa script of the Yuan dynasty. He believed that the role of 'Phags-pa script in the creation of the Korean alphabet was quite limited:\n\nLedyard posits that five of the Korean letters have shapes inspired by 'Phags-pa; a sixth basic letter, the null initial , was invented by Sejong. The rest of the letters were derived internally from these six, essentially as described in the \"Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye\". However, the five borrowed consonants were not the graphically simplest letters considered basic by the \"Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye\", but instead the consonants basic to Chinese phonology: , , , , and .\n\nThe \"Hunmin Jeong-eum\" states that King Sejong adapted the (\"gojeon\", \"\"Gǔ\" Seal Script\") in creating the Korean alphabet. The has never been identified. The primary meaning of \"gǔ\" is \"old\" (\"Old Seal Script\"), frustrating philologists because the Korean alphabet bears no functional similarity to Chinese \"zhuànzì\" seal scripts. However, Ledyard believes \"gǔ\" may be a pun on \"Měnggǔ\" \"Mongol\", and that is an abbreviation of \"Mongol Seal Script\", that is, the formal variant of the 'Phags-pa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script. There were 'Phags-pa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, including some in the seal-script form, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well.\n\nIf this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with Ming China after the fall of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as \"barbarians\".\n\nAccording to Ledyard, the five borrowed letters were graphically simplified, which allowed for consonant clusters and left room to add a stroke to derive the aspirate plosives, . But in contrast to the traditional account, the non-plosives () were derived by \"removing\" the top of the basic letters. He points out that while it is easy to derive from by removing the top, it is not clear how to derive from in the traditional account, since the shape of is not analogous to those of the other plosives.\n\nThe explanation of the letter \"ng\" also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with \"ng\", but by King Sejong's day, initial \"ng\" was either silent or pronounced in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of \"ng\" (the short vertical line left by removing the top stroke of ) would have looked almost identical to the vowel . Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from was added to the null symbol to create (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both the pronunciation in the middle or end of a word, and the usual silence at the beginning. (The graphic distinction between null and \"ng\" was eventually lost.)\n\nAnother letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations was , which transcribed the Chinese initial . This represented either \"m\" or \"w\" in various Chinese dialects, and was composed of [m] plus (from 'Phags-pa [w]). In 'Phags-pa, a loop under a letter represented \"w\" after vowels, and Ledyard hypothesized that this became the loop at the bottom of . In 'Phags-pa the Chinese initial is also transcribed as a compound with \"w\", but in its case the \"w\" is placed under an \"h\". Actually, the Chinese consonant series \"w\", \"v\", \"f\" is transcribed in 'Phags-pa by the addition of a \"w\" under three graphic variants of the letter for \"h\", and the Korean alphabet parallels this convention by adding the \"w\" loop to the labial series \"m\", \"b\", \"p\", producing now-obsolete \"w\", \"v\", \"f.\" (Phonetic values in Korean are uncertain, as these consonants were only used to transcribe Chinese.)\n\nAs a final piece of evidence, Ledyard notes that most of the borrowed Korean letters were simple geometric shapes, at least originally, but that \"d\" [t] always had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as the 'Phags-pa \"d\" [t] did. This lip can be traced back to the Tibetan letter \"d\".\n\nNumerous obsolete Korean letters and sequences are no longer used in Korean. Some of these letters were only ever used to represent the sounds of Chinese rime tables. Some of the Korean sounds represented by these obsolete letters still exist in some dialects.\nIn the original Korean alphabet system, double letters were used to represent Chinese voiced () consonants, which survive in the Shanghainese slack consonants and were not used for Korean words. It was only later that a similar convention was used to represent the modern \"tense\" (faucalized) consonants of Korean.\n\nThe sibilant (\"dental\") consonants were modified to represent the two series of Chinese sibilants, alveolar and retroflex, a \"round\" vs. \"sharp\" distinction (analogous to \"s\" vs \"sh\") which was never made in Korean, and was even being lost from southern Chinese. The alveolar letters had longer left stems, while retroflexes had longer right stems:\n\n\nTo make the Korean alphabet a perfect morphophonological fit to the Korean language, North Korea introduced six new letters, which were published in the \"New Orthography for the Korean Language\" and used officially from 1948 to 1954.\n\nTwo obsolete letters were restored: (), which was used to indicate an alternation in pronunciation between initial and final ; and (), which was only pronounced between vowels. Two modifications of the letter were introduced, one for a , which is silent finally, and one for a , which doubled between vowels. A hybrid letter was introduced for words that alternated between those two sounds (that is, a , which became before a vowel). Finally, a vowel was introduced for variable iotation.\n\nHangul Jamo (U+1100–U+11FF) and Hangul Compatibility Jamo (U+3130–U+318F) blocks were added to the Unicode Standard in June 1993 with the release of version 1.1. The characters were relocated to their present locations in July, 1996 with the release of version 2.0.\n\nHangul Jamo Extended-A (U+A960–U+A97F) and Hangul Jamo Extended-B (U+D7B0–U+D7FF) blocks were added to the Unicode Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2.\n\nParenthesised (U+3200–U+321E) and circled (U+3260–U+327E) Hangul compatibility characters are in the Enclosed CJK Letters and Months block:\nHalf-width Hangul compatibility characters (U+FFA0–U+FFDC) are in the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block:\nThe Korean alphabet in other Unicode blocks:\n\nExcept for a few grammatical morphemes prior to the twentieth century, no letter stands alone to represent elements of the Korean language. Instead, letters are grouped into syllabic or morphemic blocks of at least two and often three: a consonant or a doubled consonant called the \"initial\" (초성, 初聲 \"choseong\" syllable onset), a vowel or diphthong called the \"medial\" (중성, 中聲 \"jungseong\" syllable nucleus), and, optionally, a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of the syllable, called the \"final\" (종성, 終聲 \"jongseong\" syllable coda). When a syllable has no actual initial consonant, the null initial \"ieung\" is used as a placeholder. (In the modern Korean alphabet, placeholders are not used for the final position.) Thus, a block contains a minimum of two letters, an initial and a medial. Although the Korean alphabet had historically been organized into syllables, in the modern orthography it is first organized into morphemes, and only secondarily into syllables within those morphemes, with the exception that single-consonant morphemes may not be written alone.\n\nThe sets of initial and final consonants are not the same. For instance, \"ng\" only occurs in final position, while the doubled letters that can occur in final position are limited to \"ss\" and \"kk\".\n\nNot including obsolete letters, 11,172 blocks are possible in the Korean alphabet.\n\nThe placement or \"stacking\" of letters in the block follows set patterns based on the shape of the medial.\n\nConsonant and vowel sequences such as \"bs,\" \"wo,\" or obsolete \"bsd,\" \"üye\" are written left to right.\n\nVowels (medials) are written under the initial consonant, to the right, or wrap around the initial from bottom to right, depending on their shape: If the vowel has a horizontal axis like \"eu,\" then it is written under the initial; if it has a vertical axis like \"i,\" then it is written to the right of the initial; and if it combines both orientations, like \"ui,\" then it wraps around the initial from the bottom to the right:\n\nA final consonant, if present, is always written at the bottom, under the vowel. This is called \"batchim\" \"supporting floor\":\n\nA complex final is written left to right:\n\nBlocks are always written in phonetic order, initial-medial-final. Therefore:\n\nNormally the resulting block is written within a square of the same size and shape as a Hanja (Chinese character) by compressing or stretching the letters to fill the bounds of the block; therefore someone not familiar with the scripts may mistake the Korean alphabet for Hanja or Chinese.\n\nHowever, some recent fonts (for example Eun, , UnJamo]) move towards the European practice of letters whose relative size is fixed, and use whitespace to fill letter positions not used in a particular block, and away from the East Asian tradition of square block characters (). They break one or more of the traditional rules:\n\nThese fonts have been used as design accents on signs or headings, rather than for typesetting large volumes of body text.\n\nThere was a minor and unsuccessful movement in the early twentieth century to abolish syllabic blocks and write the letters individually and in a row, in the fashion of writing Latin alphabet as in English and other European languages. e.g. for \"Hangeul.\" It is called 풀어쓰기 (\"pul-eo-sseu-gi\" 'unassembled writing').\n\nAvant-garde typographer Ahn Sangsu made a font for the \"Hangul Dada\" exposition that exploded the syllable blocks; but while it strings out the letters horizontally, it retains the distinctive vertical position each letter would normally have within a block, unlike the century-old linear writing proposals.\n\nSuch an idea of writing Korean with Hangul jamo without being assembled into syllabic characters is of a historical interest only as it foregoes the most distinctive feature of the Hangul writing system, that is, the standard convention of 모아쓰기 (\"mo-a-sseu-gi\" 'assembled writing').\n\nUntil the 20th century, no official orthography of the Korean alphabet had been established. Due to liaison, heavy consonant assimilation, dialectal variants and other reasons, a Korean word can potentially be spelled in multiple ways. Sejong seemed to prefer morphophonemic spelling (representing the underlying root forms) rather than a phonemic one (representing the actual sounds). However, early in its history the Korean alphabet was dominated by phonemic spelling. Over the centuries the orthography became partially morphophonemic, first in nouns and later in verbs. The modern Korean alphabet is as morphophonemic as is practical. The difference between phonetic Romanization, phonemic orthography and morpho-phonemic orthography can be illustrated with the phrase \"motaneun sarami\":\n\nAfter the Gabo Reform in 1894, the Joseon Dynasty and later the Korean Empire started to write all official documents in the Korean alphabet. Under the government's management, proper usage of the Korean alphabet and Hanja, including orthography, was discussed, until the Korean Empire was annexed by Japan in 1910.\n\nThe Government-General of Korea popularised a writing style that mixed Hanja and the Korean alphabet, and was used in the later Joseon dynasty. The government revised the spelling rules in 1912, 1921 and 1930, to be relatively phonemic.\n\nThe Hangul Society, founded by Ju Si-gyeong, announced a proposal for a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for orthography of the Korean alphabet is called \"Hangeul Matchumbeop\", whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.\n\nSince the Late Joseon dynasty period, various Hanja-Hangul mixed systems were used. In these systems, Hanja were used for lexical roots, and the Korean alphabet for grammatical words and inflections, much as \"kanji\" and \"kana\" are used in Japanese. Hanja have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating homonyms.\n\nIndo-Arabic numerals are mixed in with the Korean alphabet, e.g. (22 March 2007).\n\nLatin script and occasionally other scripts may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated loanwords. Very occasionally non-Hangul letters may be mixed into Korean syllabic blocks, as \"Ga\" at right.\n\nBecause of syllable clustering, words are shorter on the page than their linear counterparts would be, and the boundaries between syllables are easily visible (which may aid reading, if segmenting words into syllables is more natural for the reader than dividing them into phonemes). Because the component parts of the syllable are relatively simple phonemic characters, the number of strokes per character on average is lower than in Chinese characters. Unlike syllabaries, such as Japanese kana, or Chinese logographs, none of which encode the constituent phonemes within a syllable, the graphic complexity of Korean syllabic blocks varies in direct proportion with the phonemic complexity of the syllable. Unlike linear alphabets such as those derived from Latin, Korean orthography allows the reader to \"utilize both the horizontal and vertical visual fields\". Finally, since Korean syllables are represented both as collections of phonemes and as unique-looking graphs, they may allow for both visual and aural retrieval of words from the lexicon.\n\nThe Korean alphabet may be written either vertically or horizontally. The traditional direction is from top to bottom, right to left. Horizontal writing in the style of the Latin script was promoted by Ju Si-gyeong, and has become overwhelmingly prevalent.\n\nIn \"Hunmin Jeongeum\", the Korean alphabet was printed in sans-serif angular lines of even thickness. This style is found in books published before about 1900, and can be found in stone carvings (on statues, for example).\n\nOver the centuries, an ink-brush style of calligraphy developed, employing the same style of lines and angles as traditional Korean calligraphy. This brush style is called \"gungche\" (), which means \"Palace Style\" because the style was mostly developed and used by the maidservants (\"gungnyeo,\" ) of the court in Joseon dynasty.\n\nModern styles that are more suited for printed media were developed in the 20th century. In 1993, new names for both Myeongjo () and Gothic styles were introduced when Ministry of Culture initiated an effort to standardize typographic terms, and the names \"Batang\" (, meaning \"background\") and \"Dotum\" (, meaning \"stand out\") replaced Myeongjo and Gothic respectively. These names are also used in Microsoft Windows.\n\nA sans-serif style with lines of equal width is popular with pencil and pen writing and is often the default typeface of Web browsers. A minor advantage of this style is that it makes it easier to distinguish \"-eung\" from \"-ung\" even in small or untidy print, as the \"jongseong ieung\" () of such fonts usually lacks a serif that could be mistaken for the short vertical line of the letter \"(u)\".\n\n\n\n"}

It can also be called \"seamless\" broadcasting and is frequently used during television marathons and back-to-back airings of episodes of the same series. The technique is also used by many local network affiliates in the United States to seamlessly transition from a local newscast to a network newscast.\n\nIn December 1992, for the premiere of \"The Jackie Thomas Show\", a hot switch was used where the end of an episode of \"Roseanne\" had the Connor family watching the new show on television, and then the new show then began.

{"id": "64304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64304", "title": "Jesus Prayer", "text": "Jesus Prayer\n\nThe Jesus Prayer (or The Prayer) is a short formulaic prayer esteemed and advocated especially within the Eastern churches: \"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\" The prayer has been widely taught and discussed throughout the history of the Orthodox Church. The ancient and original form did not include the words, \"a sinner\", which were added later. It is often repeated continually as a part of personal ascetic practice, its use being an integral part of the eremitic tradition of prayer known as Hesychasm. The prayer is particularly esteemed by the spiritual fathers of this tradition (see \"Philokalia\") as a method of opening up the heart (\"kardia\") and bringing about the Prayer of the Heart (). The Prayer of The Heart is considered to be the Unceasing Prayer that the apostle Paul advocates in the New Testament. Theophan the Recluse regarded the \"Jesus Prayer\" stronger than all other prayers by virtue of the power of the Holy Name of Jesus.\n\nWhile its tradition, on historical grounds, also belongs to the Eastern Catholics, and there have been a number of Latin Catholic texts on the Jesus Prayer, its practice has never achieved the same popularity in the Latin Church as in the Eastern Orthodox Church, although it can be said on the Anglican rosary. As distinct from the prayer itself, the Eastern Orthodox theology of the Jesus Prayer enunciated in the 14th century by Gregory Palamas was generally rejected by Latin Catholic theologians until the 20th century, but Pope John Paul II called Gregory Palamas a saint, cited him as a great writer, and an authority on theology and spoke with appreciation of Palamas's intent \"to emphasize the concrete possibility that man is given to unite himself with the Triune God in the intimacy of his heart\". In the Jesus Prayer can be seen the Eastern counterpart of the rosary, which has developed to hold a similar place in the Christian West.\n\nThe prayer's origin is most likely the Egyptian desert, which was settled by the monastic Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers in the 5th century.\n\nA formula similar to the standard form of the Jesus Prayer is found in a letter attributed to John Chrysostom, who died in AD 407. This \"Letter to an Abbot\" speaks of \"Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy\" and \"Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us\" being used as ceaseless prayer. However, some consider this letter dubious or spurious and attribute it to an unknown writer of unknown date.\n\nWhat may be the earliest explicit reference to the Jesus Prayer in a form that is similar to that used today is in \"Discourse on Abba Philimon\" from the \"Philokalia\". Philimon lived around AD 600. The version cited by Philimon is, \"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me,\" which is apparently the earliest source to cite this standard version. While the prayer itself was in use by that time, John S. Romanides writes that \"We are still searching the Fathers for the term 'Jesus prayer.\n\nA similar idea is recommended in the \"Ladder of Divine Ascent\" of John Climacus (circa 523–606), who recommends the regular practice of a \"monologistos\", or one-worded \"Jesus Prayer\". The use of the Jesus Prayer according to the tradition of the \"Philokalia\" is the subject of the 19th century anonymous Russian spiritual classic \"The Way of a Pilgrim\", also in the original form, without the addition of the words \"a sinner\".\n\nThough the Jesus Prayer has been practiced through the centuries as part of the Eastern tradition, in the 20th century, it also began to be used in some Western churches, including some Latin Catholic and Anglican churches.\n\nThe hesychastic practice of the Jesus Prayer is founded on the biblical view by which God's name is conceived as the place of his presence. Orthodox mysticism has no images or representations. The mystical practice (the prayer and the meditation) doesn't lead to perceiving representations of God (see below Palamism). Thus, the most important means of a life consecrated to praying is the invoked \"name of God\", as it is emphasized since the 5th century by the Thebaid anchorites, or by the later Athonite hesychasts. For the Orthodox the power of the Jesus Prayer comes not only from its content, but from the very invocation of Jesus name.\n\nTheologically, the Jesus Prayer is considered to be the response of the Holy Tradition to the lesson taught by the parable of the Publican and the Pharisee, in which the Pharisee demonstrates the improper way to pray by exclaiming: \"Thank you Lord that I am not like the Publican\", whereas the Publican prays correctly in humility, saying \"Lord have mercy on me, a sinner\" ().\n\nThe essence–energies distinction, a central principle in Orthodox theology, was first formulated by Gregory of Nyssa and developed by Gregory Palamas in the 14th century in support of the mystical practices of Hesychasm and against Barlaam of Seminara. It stands that God's \"essence\" (, \"ousia\") is distinct from God's \"energies\", or manifestations in the world, by which men can experience the Divine. The energies are \"unbegotten\" or \"uncreated\". They were revealed in various episodes of the Bible: the burning bush seen by Moses, the Light on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration.\n\nApophatism (negative theology) is the main characteristic of the Eastern theological tradition. Incognoscibility is not conceived as agnosticism or refusal to know God, because the Eastern theology is not concerned with abstract concepts; it is contemplative, with a discourse on things above rational understanding. Therefore, dogmas are often expressed antinomically. This form of contemplation, is experience of God, illumination called the Vision of God or in Greek theoria.\n\nFor the Eastern Orthodox the knowledge or of the uncreated energies is usually linked to apophatism.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church holds a non-juridical view of sin, by contrast to the satisfaction view of atonement for sin as articulated in the West, firstly by Anselm of Canterbury (as debt of honor)) and Thomas Aquinas (as a moral debt). The terms used in the East are less legalistic (\"grace\", \"punishment\"), and more medical (\"sickness\", \"healing\") with less exacting precision. Sin, therefore, does not carry with it the guilt for breaking a rule, but rather the impetus to become something more than what men usually are. One repents not because one is or isn't virtuous, but because human nature can change. Repentance (, \"metanoia\", \"changing one's mind\") isn't remorse, justification, or punishment, but a continual enactment of one's freedom, deriving from renewed choice and leading to restoration (the return to man's original state). This is reflected in the Mystery of Confession for which, not being limited to a mere confession of sins and presupposing recommendations or penalties, it is primarily that the priest acts in his capacity of spiritual father. The Mystery of Confession is linked to the spiritual development of the individual, and relates to the practice of choosing an elder to trust as his or her spiritual guide, turning to him for advice on the personal spiritual development, confessing sins, and asking advice.\n\nAs stated at the local Council of Constantinople in 1157, Christ brought his redemptive sacrifice not to the Father alone, but to the Trinity as a whole. In the Eastern Orthodox theology redemption isn't seen as \"ransom\". It is the \"reconciliation\" of God with man, the manifestation of God’s love for humanity. Thus, it is not the anger of God the Father but His love that lies behind the sacrificial death of his son on the cross.\n\nThe redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through theosis. The initiative belongs to God, but presupposes man's active acceptance (not an action only, but an attitude), which is a way of perpetually receiving God.\n\nThe practice of contemplative or meditative chanting is known in several religions including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam (e.g. japa, zikr). The form of internal contemplation involving profound inner transformations affecting all the levels of the self is common to the traditions that posit the ontological value of personhood. The history of these practices, including their possible spread from one religion to another, is not well understood. Such parallels (like between unusual psycho-spiritual experiences, breathing practices, postures, spiritual guidances of elders, peril warnings) might easily have arisen independently of one another, and in any case must be considered within their particular religious frameworks.\n\nAlthough some aspects of the Jesus Prayer may resemble some aspects of other traditions, its Christian character is central rather than mere \"local color\". The aim of the Christian practicing it is not limited to attaining humility, love, or purification of sinful thoughts, but rather it is becoming holy and seeking union with God (\"theosis\"), which subsumes all the aforementioned virtues. Thus, for the Eastern Orthodox:\n\nA magistral way of meeting God for the Orthodox, the Jesus Prayer does not harbor any secrets in itself, nor does its practice reveal any esoteric truths. Instead, as a hesychastic practice, it demands setting the mind apart from rational activities and ignoring the physical senses for the experiential knowledge of God. It stands along with the regular expected actions of the believer (prayer, almsgiving, repentance, fasting etc.) as the response of the Orthodox Tradition to Paul the Apostle's challenge to \"pray without ceasing\" (). It is also linked to the Song of Solomon's passage from the Old Testament: \"I sleep, but my heart is awake\" (Song of Solomon 5:2). The analogy being that as a lover is always conscious to his or her beloved, people can also achieve a state of \"constant prayer\" where they are always conscious of God's presence in their lives.\n\nThe practice of the Jesus Prayer is integrated into the mental ascesis undertaken by the Orthodox monastic in the practice of hesychasm. Yet the Jesus Prayer is not limited only to monastic life or to clergy. Anyone may practice this prayer, laypeople and clergy, men, women and children.\n\nIn the Eastern tradition the prayer is said or prayed repeatedly, often with the aid of a prayer rope (; ), which is a cord, usually woolen, tied with many knots. The person saying the prayer says one repetition for each knot. It may be accompanied by prostrations and the sign of the cross, signaled by beads strung along the prayer rope at intervals.\nThe prayer rope is \"a tool of prayer\" and an aid to beginners or those who face difficulties practicing the Prayer.\n\nThe Jesus Prayer may be practiced under the guidance and supervision of a spiritual guide (pneumatikos, ), and or Starets, especially when psychosomatic techniques (like rhythmical breath) are incorporated. A person that acts as a spiritual \"father\" and advisor may be an official certified by the Church Confessor (Pneumatikos Exolmologitis) or sometimes a spiritually experienced monk (called in Greek Gerontas (Elder) or in Russian Starets). It is possible for that person to be a layperson, usually a \"practical theologician\" (i.e. a person well versed in Orthodox theology but without official credentials, certificates, diplomas etc.).\n\nThere are no fixed rules for those who pray, \"the way there is no mechanical, physical or mental technique which can force God to show his presence\" (Metropolitan Kallistos Ware).\n\nIn \"The Way of a Pilgrim\", the pilgrim advises, \"as you draw your breath in, say, or imagine yourself saying, 'Lord Jesus Christ,' and as you breathe again, 'have mercy on me.'\" Another option is to say (orally or mentally) the whole prayer while breathing in and again the whole prayer while breathing out and yet another, to breathe in recite the whole prayer, breathe out while reciting the whole prayer again. One can also hold the breath for a few seconds between breathing in and out.\n\nMonks may pray this prayer many hundreds of times each night as part of their private cell vigil (\"cell rule\"). Under the guidance of an Elder (Russian \"Starets\"; Greek \"Gerondas\"), the monk aims to internalize the prayer, so that he is praying unceasingly. Diadochos of Photiki refers in \"On Spiritual Knowledge and Discrimination\" to the automatic repetition of the Jesus Prayer, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, even in sleep. This state is regarded as the accomplishment of Paul the Apostle's exhortation to the Thessalonians to \"pray without ceasing\" ().\n\nThe Jesus Prayer can be used for a kind of \"psychological\" self-analysis. According to the \"Way of the Pilgrim\" account and Mount Athos practitioners of the Jesus Prayer, \"one can have some insight on his or her current psychological situation by observing the intonation of the words of the prayer, as they are recited. Which word is stressed most. This self-analysis could reveal to the praying person things about their inner state and feelings, maybe not yet realised, of their unconsciousness.\"\n\n\"While praying the Jesus Prayer, one might notice that sometimes the word 'Lord' is pronounced louder, more stressed, than the others, like: \"Lord\" Jesus Christ, (Son of God), have mercy on me, (a/the sinner). In this case, they say, it means that our inner self is currently more aware of the fact that Jesus is the Lord, maybe because we need reassurance that he is in control of everything (and our lives too). Other times, the stressed word is 'Jesus': Lord \"Jesus\" Christ, (Son of God), have mercy on me, (a/the sinner). In that case, they say, we feel the need to personally appeal more to his human nature, the one that is more likely to understands our human problems and shortcomings, maybe because we are going through tough personal situations. Likewise if the word 'Christ' is stressed it could be that we need to appeal to Jesus as Messiah and Mediator, between humans and God the Father, and so on. When the word 'Son' is stressed maybe we recognise more Jesus' relationship with the Father. If 'of God' is stressed then we could realise more Jesus' unity with the Father. A stressed 'have mercy on me' shows a specific, or urgent, need for mercy. A stressed 'a sinner' (or 'the sinner') could mean that there is a particular current realisation of the sinful human nature or a particular need for forgiveness.\n\n\"In order to do this kind of self-analysis one should better start reciting the prayer relaxed and naturally for a few minutes so the observation won't be consciously 'forced', and then to start paying attention to the intonation as described above.\n\nAlso, a person might want to consciously stress one of the words of the prayer in particular when one wants to express a conscious feeling of situation. So in times of need stressing the 'have mercy' part can be more comforting or more appropriate. In times of failures, the 'a sinner' part, etc...).\"\n\nPaul Evdokimov, a 20th-century Russian philosopher and theologian, writes about beginner's way of praying: initially, the prayer is excited because the man is emotive and a flow of psychic contents is expressed. In his view this condition comes, for the modern men, from the separation of the mind from the heart: \"The prattle spreads the soul, while the silence is drawing it together.\" Old fathers condemned elaborate phraseologies, for one word was enough for the publican, and one word saved the thief on the cross. They only uttered Jesus' name by which they were contemplating God. For Evdokimov the acting faith denies any formalism which quickly installs in the external prayer or in the life duties; he quotes Seraphim of Sarov: \"The prayer is not thorough if the man is self-conscious and he is aware he's praying.\"\n\n\"Because the prayer is a living reality, a deeply personal encounter with the living God, it is not to be confined to any given classification or rigid analysis\" an on-line catechism reads. As general guidelines for the practitioner, different number of levels (3, 7 or 9) in the practice of the prayer are distinguished by Orthodox fathers. They are to be seen as being purely informative, because the practice of the Prayer of the Heart is learned under personal spiritual guidance in Eastern Orthodoxy which emphasizes the perils of temptations when it's done by one's own. Thus, Theophan the Recluse, a 19th-century Russian spiritual writer, talks about three stages:\nOnce this is achieved the Jesus Prayer is said to become \"self-active\" (). It is repeated automatically and unconsciously by the mind, becoming an internal habit like a (beneficial) Earworm. Body, through the uttering of the prayer, mind, through the mental repetition of the prayer, are thus unified with \"the heart\" (spirit) and the prayer becomes constant, ceaselessly \"playing\" in the background of the mind, like a background music, without hindering the normal everyday activities of the person.\n\nOthers, like Father Archimandrite Ilie Cleopa, one of the most representative spiritual fathers of contemporary Romanian Orthodox monastic spirituality, talk about nine levels (see External links). They are the same path to theosis, more slenderly differentiated:\n\nIn its more advanced use, the monk aims to attain to a sober practice of the Jesus Prayer in the heart free of images. It is from this condition, called by John Climacus and Hesychios the \"guard of the mind\", that the monk is raised by the divine grace to contemplation.\n\nA number of different repetitive prayer formulas have been attested in the history of Eastern Orthodox monasticism: the Prayer of St. Ioannikios the Great (754–846): \"My hope is the Father, my refuge is the Son, my shelter is the Holy Ghost, O Holy Trinity, Glory unto You,\" the repetitive use of which is described in his \"Life\"; or the more recent practice of Nikolaj Velimirović.\n\nSimilarly to the flexibility of the practice of the Jesus Prayer, there is no imposed standardization of its form. The prayer can be from as short as \"Lord, have mercy\" (Kyrie eleison), \"Have mercy on me\" (\"Have mercy upon us\"), or even \"Jesus\", to its longer most common form. It can also contain a call to the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), or to the saints. The single essential and invariable element is Jesus' name.\n\nThe Jesus Prayer is a core part of the plot in J. D. Salinger's pair of stories \"Franny and Zooey\". Its use in that book is itself referenced in Jeffrey Eugenides's novel, The Marriage Plot.\nThe prayer is also a central theme of the 2006 Russian film \"Ostrov\".\n\nPart four of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is dedicated to Christian prayer, devotes paragraphs 2665 to 2669 to prayer to Jesus.\n\nIn his poem \"The Book of the Twelve Béguines\", John of Ruysbroeck, a 14th-century Flemish mystic beatified by Pope Pius X in 1908, wrote of \"the uncreated Light, which is not God, but is the intermediary between Him and the 'seeing thought'\" as illuminating the contemplative not in the highest mode of contemplation, but in the second of the four ascending modes.\n\nSimilar methods of prayer in use in the Catholic Church are recitation, as recommended by John Cassian, of \"O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me\" or other verses of Scripture; repetition of a single monosyllabic word, as suggested by the Cloud of Unknowing; the method used in Centering Prayer; the method used by The World Community for Christian Meditation, based on the Aramaic invocation \"Maranatha\"; the use of Lectio Divina; etc. \n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church says:\nIn addition to Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, many Christians of other traditions also use the Jesus Prayer, primarily as a centering prayer or for contemplative prayer. The prayer is sometimes used with the Anglican rosary. The structure and content of the Jesus Prayer also bears a resemblance to the \"Sinner's Prayer\" used by many evangelical Protestants.\n\n\n"}

It is divided into two dialects, Northeastern Karakalpak and Southeastern Karakalpak. It developed alongside neighboring Kazakh and Uzbek languages, being markedly influenced by both. Typologically, Karakalpak belongs to the Kipchak branch of the Turkic languages, thus being closely related to and partially mutually intelligible to Kazakh.\n\nKarakalpak is a member of the Kipchak branch of Turkic languages, which includes Tatar, Kumyk, Nogai, and Kazakh. Due to its proximity to Uzbek, much of Karakalpak's vocabulary and grammar has been influenced by Uzbek. Like Turkish, Karakalpak has vowel harmony, is agglutinative and has no grammatical gender. Word order is usually subject–object–verb.\n\nKarakalpak is spoken mainly in the Karakalpakstan Autonomous Republic of Uzbekistan. Approximately 2,000 people in Afghanistan and smaller diaspora in parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, and other parts of the world speak Karakalpak.\n\nKarakalpak has official status in the Karakalpakstan Autonomous Republic.\n\nThe Ethnologue identifies two dialects of Karakalpak: Northeastern and Southwestern. Menges mentions a third possible dialect spoken in the Fergana Valley. The Southwestern dialect has /tʃ/ for the Northeastern /ʃ/.\n\nKarakalpak has 21 native consonant phonemes and regularly uses four non-native phonemes in loan words. Non-native sounds are shown in parentheses.\n\nVowel harmony functions in Karakalpak much as it does in other Turkic languages. Words borrowed from Russian or other languages may not observe rules of vowel harmony, but the following rules usually apply:\n\n\"men\" I, \"sen\" you (singular), \"ol\" he, she, it, that, \"biz\" we, \"siz\" you (plural), \"olar\" they\n\n\"bir\" 1, \"eki\" 2, \"úsh\" 3, \"tórt\" 4, \"bes\" 5, \"altı\" 6, \"jeti\" 7, \"segiz\" 8, \"toǵıs\" 9, \"on\" 10, \"júz\" 100, \"mıń\" 1000\n\nKarakalpak was written in the Arabic and Persian script until 1928, in the Latin script (with additional characters) from 1928 to 1940, after which Cyrillic was introduced. Following Uzbekistan's independence in 1991, the decision was made to drop Cyrillic and revert to the Latin alphabet. Whilst the use of Latin script is now widespread in Tashkent, its introduction into Karakalpakstan remains gradual. The Cyrillic and Latin alphabets are shown below with their equivalent representations in the IPA. Cyrillic letters with no representation in the Latin alphabet are marked with asterisks. The last changes to the new Karakalpak alphabet were made in 2016: instead of letters with apostrophes, letters with acutes were introduced.\n\nBefore 2009, C was written as TS; I and I' were written as dotted and dotless I.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "155430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155430", "title": "Kleene algebra", "text": "Kleene algebra\n\nIn mathematics, a Kleene algebra ( ; named after Stephen Cole Kleene) is an idempotent (and thus partially ordered) semiring endowed with a closure operator. It generalizes the operations known from regular expressions.\n\nVarious inequivalent definitions of Kleene algebras and related structures have been given in the literature. Here we will give the definition that seems to be the most common nowadays.\n\nA Kleene algebra is a set \"A\" together with two binary operations + : \"A\" × \"A\" → \"A\" and · : \"A\" × \"A\" → \"A\" and one function : \"A\" → \"A\", written as \"a\" + \"b\", \"ab\" and \"a\" respectively, so that the following axioms are satisfied.\nThe above axioms define a semiring. We further require:\nIt is now possible to define a partial order ≤ on \"A\" by setting \"a\" ≤ \"b\" if and only if \"a\" + \"b\" = \"b\" (or equivalently: \"a\" ≤ \"b\" if and only if there exists an \"x\" in \"A\" such that \"a\" + \"x\" = \"b\"; with any definition, \"a\" ≤ \"b\" ≤ \"a\" implies \"a\" = \"b\"). With this order we can formulate the last four axioms about the operation :\n\nIntuitively, one should think of \"a\" + \"b\" as the \"union\" or the \"least upper bound\" of \"a\" and \"b\" and of \"ab\" as some multiplication which is monotonic, in the sense that \"a\" ≤ \"b\" implies \"ax\" ≤ \"bx\". The idea behind the star operator is \"a\" = 1 + \"a\" + \"aa\" + \"aaa\" + ... From the standpoint of programming language theory, one may also interpret + as \"choice\", · as \"sequencing\" and as \"iteration\".\n\nLet Σ be a finite set (an \"alphabet\") and let \"A\" be the set of all regular expressions over Σ. We consider two such regular expressions equal if they describe the same language. Then \"A\" forms a Kleene algebra. In fact, this is a free Kleene algebra in the sense that any equation among regular expressions follows from the Kleene algebra axioms and is therefore valid in every Kleene algebra.\n\nAgain let Σ be an alphabet. Let \"A\" be the set of all regular languages over Σ (or the set of all context-free languages over Σ; or the set of all recursive languages over Σ; or the set of \"all\" languages over Σ). Then the union (written as +) and the concatenation (written as ·) of two elements of \"A\" again belong to \"A\", and so does the Kleene star operation applied to any element of \"A\". We obtain a Kleene algebra \"A\" with 0 being the empty set and 1 being the set that only contains the empty string.\n\nLet \"M\" be a monoid with identity element \"e\" and let \"A\" be the set of all subsets of \"M\". For two such subsets \"S\" and \"T\", let \"S\" + \"T\" be the union of \"S\" and \"T\" and set \"ST\" = {\"st\" : \"s\" in \"S\" and \"t\" in \"T\"}. \"S\" is defined as the submonoid of \"M\" generated by \"S\", which can be described as {\"e\"} ∪ \"S\" ∪ \"SS\" ∪ \"SSS\" ∪ ... Then \"A\" forms a Kleene algebra with 0 being the empty set and 1 being {\"e\"}. An analogous construction can be performed for any small category.\n\nThe linear subspaces of a unital algebra over a field form a Kleene algebra. Given linear subspaces \"V\" and \"W\", define \"V\" + \"W\" to be the sum of the two subspaces, and 0 to be the trivial subspace {0}. Define \"V\" · \"W\" = span {v · w | v ∈ V, w ∈ W}, the linear span of the product of vectors from \"V\" and \"W\" respectively. Define 1 = span {I}, the span of the unit of the algebra. The closure of \"V\" is the direct sum of all powers of \"V\".\n\nSuppose \"M\" is a set and \"A\" is the set of all binary relations on \"M\". Taking + to be the union, · to be the composition and to be the reflexive transitive closure, we obtain a Kleene algebra.\n\nEvery Boolean algebra with operations formula_2 and formula_3 turns into a Kleene algebra if we use formula_2 for +, formula_3 for · and set \"a\" = 1 for all \"a\".\n\nA quite different Kleene algebra can be used to implement the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, computing the shortest path's length for every two vertices of a weighted directed graph, by Kleene's algorithm, computing a regular expression for every two states of a deterministic finite automaton.\nUsing the extended real number line, take \"a\" + \"b\" to be the minimum of \"a\" and \"b\" and \"ab\" to be the ordinary sum of \"a\" and \"b\" (with the sum of +∞ and −∞ being defined as +∞). \"a\" is defined to be the real number zero for nonnegative \"a\" and −∞ for negative \"a\". This is a Kleene algebra with zero element +∞ and one element the real number zero. \nA weighted directed graph can then be considered as a deterministic finite automaton, with each transition labelled by its weight.\nFor any two graph nodes (automaton states), the regular expressions computed from Kleene's algorithm evaluates, in this particular Kleene algebra, to the shortest path length between the nodes.\n\nZero is the smallest element: 0 ≤ \"a\" for all \"a\" in \"A\".\n\nThe sum \"a\" + \"b\" is the least upper bound of \"a\" and \"b\": we have \"a\" ≤ \"a\" + \"b\" and \"b\" ≤ \"a\" + \"b\" and if \"x\" is an element of \"A\" with \"a\" ≤ \"x\" and \"b\" ≤ \"x\", then \"a\" + \"b\" ≤ \"x\". Similarly, \"a\" + ... + \"a\" is the least upper bound of the elements \"a\", ..., \"a\".\n\nMultiplication and addition are monotonic: if \"a\" ≤ \"b\", then \nfor all \"x\" in \"A\".\n\nRegarding the star operation, we have \n\nIf \"A\" is a Kleene algebra and \"n\" is a natural number, then one can consider the set M(\"A\") consisting of all \"n\"-by-\"n\" matrices with entries in \"A\".\nUsing the ordinary notions of matrix addition and multiplication, one can define a unique -operation so that M(\"A\") becomes a Kleene algebra.\n\nKleene introduced regular expressions and gave some of their algebraic laws.\nAlthough he didn't define Kleene algebras, he asked for a decision procedure for equivalence of regular expressions.\nRedko proved that no finite set of \"equational\" axioms can characterize the algebra of regular languages.\nSalomaa gave complete axiomatizations of this algebra, however depending on problematic inference rules.\nThe problem of providing a complete set of axioms, which would allow derivation of all equations among regular expressions, was intensively studied by John Horton Conway under the name of \"regular algebras\", however, the bulk of his treatment was infinitary.\nIn 1981, Kozen gave a complete infinitary equational deductive system for the algebra of regular languages.\nIn 1994, he gave the above finite axiom system, which uses unconditional and conditional equalities, and is equationally complete for the algebra of regular languages, that is, two regular expressions \"a\" and \"b\" denote the same language only if \"a\"=\"b\" follows from the above axioms.\n\nKleene algebras are a particular case of closed semirings, also called quasi-regular semirings or Lehmann semirings, which are semirings in which every element has at least one quasi-inverse satisfying the equation: a* = aa* + 1 = a*a + 1. This quasi-inverse is not necessarily unique. In a Kleene algebra, a* is the least solution to the fixpoint equations: X = aX + 1 and X = Xa + 1.\n\nClosed semirings and Kleene algebras appear in algebraic path problems, a generalization of the shortest path problem.\n\n\n\n"}

Her novels include \"Dekada '70\", \"Bata, Bata, Pa'no Ka Ginawa?\", and \"‘GAPÔ\".\n\nBautista was born in Tondo, Manila, Philippines on December 2, 1945, to Esteban Bautista and Gloria Torres. She graduated from Emilio Jacinto Elementary School in 1958, and from Torres High School in 1962. She was a journalism student at the Lyceum of the Philippines, but dropped out because she had always wanted to be a writer and schoolwork was taking too much time. Her first short story, \"Katugon ng Damdamin,\" was published in Liwayway Magazine and thus started her writing career.\n\nDespite a lack of formal training, Bautista as a writer became known for her honest realism, courageous exploration of Philippine women's issues, and compelling female protagonists who confront difficult situations at home and in the workplace with uncommon grit and strength.\n\nBautista garnered several Palanca Awards (1980, 1983 and 1984) for her novels \"‘GAPÔ\", \"Dekada '70\" and \"Bata, Bata… Pa’no Ka Ginawa?\", which exposed injustices and chronicled women's activism during the Marcos era.\n\n\"‘GAPÔ\", the Palanca Awards 1980 grand prize winner, published in 1992, is the story of a man coming to grips with life as an Amerasian. It is a multi-layered scrutiny of the politics behind US bases in the Philippines, seen from the point of view of ordinary citizens living in Olongapo City.\n\n\"Dekada '70\" is the story of a family caught in the middle of the tumultuous decade of the 1970s. It details how a middle-class family struggled and faced the changes that empowered Filipinos to rise against the Marcos government. These events happened after the bombing of Plaza Miranda, the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, the proclamation of martial law and the random arrests of political prisoners. The oppressive nature of the Marcos regime, which made the people become more radical, and the shaping of the decade were all witnessed by the female protagonist, Amanda Bartolome, the mother of five boys.\n\n\"Bata, Bata… Pa'no Ka Ginawa?\", literally, \"Child, Child… How Were You Made?\", narrates the life of Lea, a working mother and a social activist, who has two children. In the end, all three, and especially Lea, have to confront Philippine society’s view of single motherhood. The novel deals with the questions of how it is to be a mother, and how a mother executes this role through modern-day concepts of parenthood.\n\nBautista's 2013 book \"In Sisterhood\" received the Filipino Readers' Choice Award Nominee for Fiction in Filipino/Taglish in 2014, organized by the Filipino Book Bloggers Group.\n\nIn 2015, Bautista launched the book \"Sixty in the City\", about the life of friends Guia, Roda and Menang, who are in their mid-60s and realize that there's a good life in being just a wife, mother and homemaker.\n\nTwo of Bautista's short stories won the Palanca Awards, namely \"Tatlong Kwento ng Buhay ni Juan Candelabra\" (Three Stories in the Life of Juan Candelabra), first prize, 1982; and \"Buwan, Buwan, Hulugan mo Ako ng Sundang\" (Moon, Moon, Drop Me a dagger), third prize, 1983.\n\nIn 1991 Bautista with Cacho Publishing House, published a compilation of short stories entitled \"Buwan, Buwan, Hulugan Mo Ako ng Sundang: Dalawang Dekada ng Maiikling Kuwento\".\n\nBautista's venture as a screenwriter produced several critically acclaimed works. Her first screenplay was \"Sakada\" (Seasonal Sugarcane Workers), 1976, which exposed the plight of Filipino peasants. Her second film was \"Kung Mahawi Man ang Ulap\" in 1984, which was nominated for awards in the Film Academy of the Philippines. Also written during the same year was \"Bulaklak ng City Jail\", based on her novel about imprisoned women, which won almost all awards for that year from various awards guilds including Star Awards and Metro Manila Film Festival. In 1998 her work was used for Chito Rono's film adaptation of \"Bata Bata Paano Ka Ginawa\", starring Vilma Santos. In 2000 she wrote \"Gusto Ko Nang Lumigaya\", the screenplay for Maryo J Delos Reyes' political drama thriller.\n\nBautista became a national fellow for fiction of the University of the Philippines Creative Writing Center in 1986. She also served as vice-president of the Screenwriters Guild of the Philippines and as chair of the Kapisanan ng mga Manunulat ng Nobelang Popular.\n\nShe was the only Filipino included in a book on foremost international women writers published in Japan in 1991.\n\nBautista was honored by the Ateneo Library of Women's Writings on March 10, 2004 during the 8th Annual Lecture on Vernacular Literature by Women. In 2005, the Feminist Centennial Film Festival presented her with a recognition award for her outstanding achievement in screenplay writing. In 2006, she was given the Diwata Award for best writer by the 16th International Women's Film Festival of the UP Film Center.\n\nExcerpts of Bautista's novels have been anthologized in \"Tulikärpänen\", a book of short stories written by Filipino women published in Finland by The Finnish-Philippine Society (FPS), a non-governmental organization founded in 1988. \"Tulikärpänen\" was edited and translated by Riitta Vartti, et al. In \"Firefly: Writings by Various Authors\", the English version of the Finnish collection, the excerpt from the Filipino novel \"Gapô\" was given the title \"The Night in Olongapo\", while the excerpt from \"Bata, Bata, Pa'no Ka Ginawa?\" was titled \"Children's Party\".\n\nA full translation of Bautista's best works could better represent the characteristics of Filipino writing in international publishing. \"Dekada '70\" has been translated to the Japanese language and was published by Mekong Publishing House in the early 1990s. \"Tatlong Kuwento ng Buhay ni Julian Candelabra\" (1st prize, Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature, 1983) was translated in English and published by The Lifted Brow in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1298450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1298450", "title": "Mechanical pencil", "text": "Mechanical pencil\n\nA mechanical pencil (US English) or propelling pencil (UK English), also clutch pencil, is a pencil with a replaceable and mechanically extendable solid pigment core called a \"lead\" . The lead, often made of graphite, is not bonded to the outer casing, and can be mechanically extended as its point is worn away. Other names include microtip pencil, automatic pencil, drafting pencil, technical pencil, click pencil, pump pen, pump pencil, leadholder, pen pencil (Indian English), and lead pencil (Bangladeshi and American English).\n\nMechanical pencils are used to provide lines of constant width without sharpening in technical drawing and in quick, neat writing. They have also been used for fine-art drawing. Since they do not have to be sharpened, they are also very popular with students. Mechanical pencils were first used in the 18th century, with many designs patented in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nConrad Gesner described a leadholder pencil in 1565, but the lead had to be manually adjusted to sharpen it. The earliest extant example of a mechanical pencil was found aboard the wreckage of HMS \"Pandora\", which sank in 1791.\n\nThe first patent for a refillable pencil with lead-propelling mechanism was issued to Sampson Mordan and John Isaac Hawkins in Britain in 1822. After buying out Hawkins' patent rights, Mordan entered into a business partnership with Gabriel Riddle from 1823 to 1837. The earliest Mordan pencils are thus hallmarked SMGR. After 1837, Sampson Mordan ended the partnership with Riddle and continued to manufacture pencils as \"S. Mordan & Co\". His company continued to manufacture pencils and a wide range of silver objects until World War II, when the factory was bombed.\n\nBetween 1822 and 1874, more than 160 patents were registered pertaining to a variety of improvements to mechanical pencils. The first spring-loaded mechanical pencil was patented in 1877 and a twist-feed mechanism was developed in 1895. The 0.9 mm lead was introduced in 1938, and later it was followed by 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 sizes. Eventually, 1.3 and 1.4 mm mechanisms were available, and 0.4 and 0.2 versions are now produced.\n\nThe mechanical pencil became successful in Japan with some improvements in 1915 by Tokuji Hayakawa, a metal worker who had just finished his apprenticeship. It was introduced as the \"Ever-Ready Sharp Pencil\". Success was not immediate, since the metal shaft—essential for the pencil's long life—was unfamiliar to users. However, the Ever-Ready Sharp began selling in huge numbers after a company from Tokyo and Osaka made large orders. Later, Tokuji Hayakawa's company got its name from that pencil: Sharp.\n\nAt nearly the same time in the US, Charles R. Keeran was developing a similar pencil that would be the precursor of most of today's pencils. Keeran's design was ratchet-based, whereas Hayakawa's was screw-based. These two development histories – Hayakawa and Keeran – are often mistakenly combined into one. Keeran patented his lead pencil in 1915 and soon afterwards arranged production. After some improvements, his design was marketed as the \"Eversharp\" pencil by the Wahl Adding Machine Company; by the early 1920s, Wahl had sold more than 12,000,000 Eversharps.\n\nSome of the manufacturers are: Pentel, Pilot, Tombow, Uni-ball and Zebra of Japan; Faber-Castell, Lamy, Rotring and Staedtler of Germany; Bic of France; PaperMate of USA; Caran d'Ache of Switzerland; Parker of UK and numerous Chinese, other Asian and European manufacurers.\n\nMechanical pencils can be divided into two basic types: those that both hold the lead and can actively propel it forward, and those that only hold the lead in position.\n\nScrew-based pencils advance the lead by twisting a screw, which moves a slider down the barrel of the pencil. This was the most common type in the earlier part of the twentieth century. Many of these have a locking mechanism one way to allow the lead to be pushed back into the pencil.\n\nA clutch pencil (or leadholder) tends to use thicker leads (2–5.6 mm) and generally holds only one piece of lead at a time. A typical clutch pencil is activated by pressing the eraser cap on the top, to open the jaws inside the tip and allow the lead to freely drop through from the barrel (or back into it when retracting). Because the lead falls out freely when the jaws are opened, its forward movement cannot be controlled except by external means. This can be easily done by keeping the tip of the pencil a few millimeters above a work surface or the palm of one's hand. Some clutch pencils do have mechanisms which incrementally advance the lead, such as the Alvin Tech-Matic leadholder, but these are not normally considered to be in the same category as most pencils with propelling mechanisms.\n\nRatchet-based pencils are a variant of the clutch pencil, in which the lead is held in place by two or three small jaws inside a ring at the tip. The jaws are controlled by a button on the end or the side of the pencil. When the button is pushed, the jaws move forward and separate, allowing the lead to advance. When the button is released and the jaws retract, the \"lead retainer\" (a small rubber device inside the tip) keeps the lead in place, preventing the lead from either falling freely outward or riding back up into the barrel until the jaws recover their grip. Other designs use a precisely-fitted metal sleeve to guide and support the lead, and do not need a rubber retainer.\n\nIn one type of ratchet-based pencil (developed by Tombow Pencil Co.), shaking the pencil back and forth causes a weight inside the pencil to operate a mechanism in the cap. A button may be present on the top or side of the pencil, to allow the user to advance the lead manually when necessary. Another variation advances the lead automatically. In this design, the lead is advanced by a ratchet but only prevented from going back into the pencil, just held from falling by a small amount of friction. The nib is a spring-loaded collar that, when depressed as the lead is worn away, extends out again when pressure is released.\n\nAn advanced ratchet type has a mechanism that rotates the pencil lead 9° counter-clockwise every time the lead is pressed on to the paper (which counts as one stroke), to distribute wear evenly. This \"auto-rotation\" mechanism keeps the lead 50% narrower than in the common propelling mechanical pencils, resulting in uniform thickness of the lines written onto the paper. The design was first developed by Mitsubishi Pencil Company, and named \"Kuru Toga\" under the Uni brand. This type of pencil is most suited for Asian languages that have multiple strokes per letter or word, where the pencil is frequently lifted off the paper. The mechanism is not suitable for cursive writing used in western scripts. Another recent auto-rotation movement by Uni rotates the lead 18 degrees per stroke (or 20 strokes per complete revolution), which is better suited for western scripts.\n\nThere exist protection mechanisms that prevent the lead from breaking (within certain limits) when excessive pressure is exerted while writing. A mechanism employed in the \"DelGuard\" system by Zebra of Japan, causes the lead sleeve to extend outward when excessive pressure is applied at an angle. When excess vertical pressure is applied on the lead, the lead is automatically retracted inwards.\n\nHigher-end mechanical pencils sometimes feature a retractable lead guide pipe. This allows the lead guide pipe to retract back into the pencil body, which will keep it protected in storage and during transit and makes it 'pocket-safe'.\n\nIn spite of the name, pencil leads do not contain the toxic chemical element lead, but are typically made with graphite and clay, or plastic polymers. Compared to standard pencils, mechanical pencils have a smaller range of marking types, though numerous variations exist. Most mechanical pencils can be refilled, but some inexpensive models are meant to be disposable and are discarded when empty.\n\nMechanical pencil mechanisms use only a single lead diameter. Some pencils, such as the Pentel Function 357, place several mechanisms within the same housing, so as to offer a range of thicknesses (in this case three: 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 mm). 1.00 mm leads also exist, but they are very rare. (See table below.)\n\nDifferent sizes of lead diameters are available to accommodate various preferences and pencil builds, as shown in the table below. The more common lead sizes are 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm, whose line widths provide a favourable balance between precision and strength. Less common lead sizes can range from 0.2 mm up to 5.6 mm. Pentel has also previously demonstrated a prototype 0.1 mm pencil.\nPencils with sub-millimeter leads can usually hold multiple leads at the same time, reducing the frequency of refills. One exception was the Pentel 350 E, possibly Pentel's first mechanical pencil, which could only hold a single stick of 0.5 mm lead. Refill leads can be bought in small tubes and inserted into the barrel as needed.\n\nAs with non-mechanical pencils, the leads of mechanical pencils are available in a range of hardness ratings, depending on the user's desired balance between darkness and durability. A commonly-used mechanical pencil lead is identical in density, but not in thickness to a traditional HB (US #2) pencil lead.\n\nMechanical pencils with colored leads are less common, but do exist. Crayola's \"Twistable\" product line includes two different types of colored pencils (erasable and non-erasable) with mechanical feed mechanisms, but does not offer refill leads. Several companies such as Pentel, Pilot, and Uni-ball (Mitsubishi Pencil Co.) currently manufacture colored refill leads in a limited range of diameters (0.5 mm, 0.7 mm, or 2 mm) for their own products. Koh-i-Noor makes mechanical colored pencils with replaceable leads in 2.0, 3.15 and 5.6 mm sizes.\n\n\n\n"}

From colonial times, the sole official language was English, but the 1997 Constitution gave equal status, for the first time, to Fijian and Hindustani, alongside English.\n\nThere is considerable debate as to whether Fijian, and possibly also Hindi, should be compulsory school subjects. In May and June 2005, a number of prominent Fiji Islanders called for the status of Fijian to be upgraded; the present Education Minister, Ro Teimumu Kepa endorsed calls for it to be made compulsory, as did Great Council of Chiefs Chairman Ratu Ovini Bokini. Similar calls came from Misiwini Qereqeretabua, the Director of the Institute of Fijian Language and Culture, and from Apolonia Tamata, a linguistics lecturer at Suva's University of the South Pacific, who both said that recognition of the Fijian language is essential to the nation's basic identity, as a unifying factor in Fiji's multicultural society.\n\nFiji Labour Party (FLP) leader Mahendra Chaudhry also endorsed the call for Fijian to be made a national language and a compulsory school subject, provided that the same status be given to Hindi - a position echoed by Krishna Vilas of the National Reconciliation Committee.\n\nAcademic and former Education Minister Taufa Vakatale said that she supported making Hindi available in all schools, but considered that Fijian should get priority. \"If the Indians in the country lost their language, there is a whole continent of people in India who would still have the language,\" she said. \"In the whole world only 330,000 people know how to speak in Fijian and if it is lost, there is nowhere it can be revived from, that is why the Fijian language is very important to preserve.\"\n\nA investigation by the Rewa Provincial Council, made public on 23 November 2005, revealed that 26 percent of indigenous children in the first and second grades of nine Rewa schools could not speak their own language. The council was exploring ways to redress this area of concern.\n\nVice-President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi added his own voice on 9 January 2006 to the campaign to make Fijian a compulsory subject. Addressing the 72nd annual meeting of the Fijian Teachers Association in Suva, Madraiwiwi said that it was dangerous to assume that Fijian children would automatically learn their own language. His parents' generation had emphasized prioritizing English on the assumption that Fijian could be learned later, but this had resulted in a generation knowing little Fijian, and unless the language was made compulsory at all levels of primary education, it would be lost to the next generation, he said.\n\nKamlesh Arya, President of the Arya Pratindhi Sabha organization, said on 29 June 2005 that language was the window by which people could appreciate and absorb tradition, and that making both Fijian and Hindustani compulsory school subjects would promote social and cultural understanding between the two races. His organization taught Fijian to Indo-Fijian students in primary schools at its own expense, he said. Given the geographical and numerical limitations of the Fijian language, it needed to be given special attention on its own merit.\n\nParliamentarian Gaffar Ahmed of the FLP spoke out on 4 August 2005 in favour of establishing Fijian as the national language. \"To achieve national unity, multi-cultural and multi-racial harmony, we should have one common language which must be taught at all schools,\" he told the House of Representatives. He said that his own inability to speak Fijian was his greatest handicap as a Fijian citizen.\n\n"}

Though the rules for the category change from organization to organization, generally, an Oratory must be written and memorized by the performer and should be no more than ten minutes in length. No more than 150 words can be quoted. The finished speech must be approved by the National Speech and Debate Association. This speech is frequently highly persuasive and is normally about a slightly controversial topic. An orator is given free choice of subject and judged solely on the effectiveness of development and presentation.\n\nOratory topics are usually related to current problems in the world, and are delivered in a persuasive way as to motivate the audience to make a choice. However, this may not always be the case. Some orations may alert the audience of an imminent threat or inspire them to act now to initiate change. According to the National Speech and Debate Association, the competitor is judged on:\n\nThese are the questions the competitor and the judge should ask themselves before performing an Oration, to either an audience, or especially yourself. The key to gain the audience's attention isn't through your topic, it's through your passion. For instance, your topic could be that people today are lazy, but instead of changing it, they are accepting it. Now the topic itself interests the audience or judge.\n\nJudges are usually Original Oratory competitors, coaches, sponsors, parents, or friends of the host tournament. Coaches are prohibited from judging their own schools, and alumni competitors must wait two years before they are allowed to judge the school from which they graduated. In some states and leagues, alumni are not allowed to judge the school from which they graduated for up to four years; this is to ensure that one may not judge one's former teammates.\n\nBecause the oratory is the speaker's original work, Oratory does require some preparation, which sets Oratory apart from Impromptu. The following are recommended parts of a good Oration:\n\n1. Introduction: The best way to deliver an Oratory is to grab the audience's attention and make them want to listen to the speaker's message, and not just \"hear\" another figure trying to persuade. Intro hooks include \"story\", \"startling fact\", \"question\", and \"joke\".\n\n2. Body: To keep an audience's attention the subject should be shown to be relevant to the audience; facts and startling figures can do this, although humorous examples and jokes also can help in explaining a topic. There is suggested to be two sources per paragraph supporting your points. There may be more or less depending on the specific needs of the paragraph. Award-winning oration often include both facts and humor.\n\n3. Conclusion: If one did not make a good impression on the audience before, chances are slim that one will not recover with a smashing conclusion. Reiterate, go over the main points of the speech and make it memorable for the audience.\n\nWhile having a factual baseline is still one of the most important parts of the speech, the inclusion of humor and personal anecdotes may boost performance. An oratory may follow a pattern:\n\nIntroduction: The introduction may begin with a joke, a story, or an interesting fact, often called the \"Attention Getting Device\". A successful oratory will either make the audience and judge laugh or grab their attention. Apart from grabbing the attention of those listening, the main purpose of the introduction is to explain in an interesting and creative manner what your speech is about. It is often important to explicitly state from the very beginning what you are talking about so the judge and audience don't have to guess. This also makes it easier for the judge, because they know what sort of things to look for when listening to the speech. This is often done in a creative way, for example, if you were doing an oratory about school you might say, \"First we'll stop at our lockers as we discuss the problem of school, then we'll head to pre-calc as we talk about the causes and effects that school has on our society, and finally, we'll go to lunch as I present a solution to this problem.\"\n\nProblem: After the introduction, an oratory will usually explain in a little more detail than what was given in the introduction what the topic is about. When doing this, the orator should explain why this topic is important. For example, if the topic is about individuality or being your own person, an Orator might explain that a decrease in individuality is bad because it lowers your ability to stand up for what you believe in or it makes you conform to standards instead of forming your own beliefs and values.\n\nCauses/Effects: Next, the orator could explain what is causing the problem. Since Oratory is generally a speech used to encourage people to take action against a problem, it is important to explain what specifically is causing the problem. This allows the audience to know specifically what they need to look out for. An orator will possibly explain that by attacking the problem by the \"roots\" (what causes it), it will be easiest to solve it. Similarly, it is important to explain the negative effects of the causes. Discussing the causes is important to the oratory because it validates the fact that the topic is, in fact, a significant problem.\n\nSolution: The most important part of an oratory is often considered the \"solution.\" This should be creative, innovative, and should be presented in such a way that will encourage both the judge and the audience to take proactive measures to act against the problem. In an oratory about individuality, the solutions might be to 1) Relax and decide what you yourself want to do, 2) Resist temptations to simply follow others even though it might be the easiest way 3) Even if others don't follow you, if you think its right, then it is the best path for you personally to take. This part of the oratory will also explain the positive benefits of following these solutions which will make the judge and the audience want to listen to them (i.e. it gives the speech merit). It is imperative that the solution is not forgotten, otherwise an oratory is simply a wasted ten minutes. No one wants to hear about a problem without being told what they can do to fix it.\n\nConclusion: Judges look at the conclusion and judge based on whether or not it ties in with the introduction. If you told a story about a problem you got yourself in for your introduction, use the conclusion to finish the story and tell how you fixed the problem. If it was a fact, elaborate on the fact. By tying the introduction to the conclusion, it gives the speech a feeling of fluidity.\n\nSome other common patterns are Introduction – Cause – Effect – Solution – Conclusion and Introduction – Problem – Cause – Solution – Conclusion.\n\n"}

The name of the bay originates from the Greek word \"γράμμα\" meaning ’letter’.\n\nThe little bay with difficult overland access but with abundant springs had always been a favorite stopping place and shelter for the ones sailing along the coast: mariners, soldiers, merchants and pirates. The city of Oricum, located 12 km to the north, was founded in the 7th century BC, and the inhabitants started to use the Grama Bay as a quarry in the 3rd century BC from where they could extract limestone of good quality. The first inscriptions carved into the eastern rock face of the bay were made by the quarry workers themselves. During the following 2,000 years further mariners made their signs on the rock which ended up in the former quarry covered by 1,500 inscriptions. Majority is written in Ancient Greek and Latin, but inscriptions in Messapian language as well as ones made by Byzantine Greeks or Ottoman Turks are also included. These typically give the name of the people and that of their vessels and often invoke the Dioscuri. Historical figures also showed up in the Grama Bay and put their marks on the rock, such as Pompey in 48 BC or John V Palaiologos in around 1369. The Roman statesman Sulla was actually never visiting the bay, but in 86 BC after defeating Mithridates VI of Pontus during the First Mithridatic War he ordered to commemorate his triumph with a new inscription made on the Grama Bay’s rocks.

{"id": "605869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=605869", "title": "Spell checker", "text": "Spell checker\n\nIn software, a spell checker (or spell check) is a software feature that checks for misspellings in a text. Features are often in software, such as a word processor, email client, electronic dictionary, or search engine.\n\nA basic spell checker carries out the following processes:\n\nIt is unclear whether morphological analysis—allowing for many different forms of a word depending on its grammatical role—provides a significant benefit for English, though its benefits for highly synthetic languages such as German, Hungarian or Turkish are clear.\n\nAs an adjunct to these components, the program's user interface will allow users to approve or reject replacements and modify the program's operation.\n\nAn alternative type of spell checker uses solely statistical information, such as n-grams, to recognize errors instead of correctly-spelled words. This approach usually requires a lot of effort to obtain sufficient statistical information. Key advantages include needing less runtime storage and the ability to correct errors in words that are not included in a dictionary. \n\nIn some cases spell checkers use a fixed list of misspellings and suggestions for those misspellings; this less flexible approach is often used in paper-based correction methods, such as the \"see also\" entries of encyclopedias.\n\nClustering algorithms have also been used for spell checking combined with phonetic information.\n\nIn 1961, Les Earnest, who headed the research on this budding technology, saw it necessary to include the first spell checker that accessed a list of 10,000 acceptable words. Ralph Gorin, a graduate student under Earnest at the time, created the first true spelling checker program written as an applications program (rather than research) for general English text: Spell for the DEC PDP-10 at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, in February 1971. Gorin wrote SPELL in assembly language, for faster action; he made the first spelling corrector by searching the word list for plausible correct spellings that differ by a single letter or adjacent letter transpositions and presenting them to the user. Gorin made SPELL publicly accessible, as was done with most SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) programs, and it soon spread around the world via the new ARPAnet, about ten years before personal computers came into general use. Spell, its algorithms and data structures inspired the Unix ispell program.\nThe first spell checkers were widely available on mainframe computers in the late 1970s. A group of six linguists from Georgetown University developed the first spell-check system for the IBM corporation.\n\nThe first spell checkers for personal computers appeared for CP/M and TRS-80 computers in 1980, followed by packages for the IBM PC after it was introduced in 1981. Developers such as Maria Mariani, Random House, Soft-Art, Microlytics, Proximity, Circle Noetics, and Reference Software rushed OEM packages or end-user products into the rapidly expanding software market, primarily for the PC but also for Apple Macintosh, VAX, and Unix. On the PCs, these spell checkers were standalone programs, many of which could be run in TSR mode from within word-processing packages on PCs with sufficient memory.\n\nHowever, the market for standalone packages was short-lived, as by the mid-1980s developers of popular word-processing packages like WordStar and WordPerfect had incorporated spell checkers in their packages, mostly licensed from the above companies, who quickly expanded support from just English to European and eventually even Asian languages. However, this required increasing sophistication in the morphology routines of the software, particularly with regard to heavily-agglutinative languages like Hungarian and Finnish. Although the size of the word-processing market in a country like Iceland might not have justified the investment of implementing a spell checker, companies like WordPerfect nonetheless strove to localize their software for as many national markets as possible as part of their global marketing strategy.\n\nFirefox 2.0, a web browser, has spell check support for user-written content, such as when editing Wikitext, writing on many webmail sites, blogs, and social networking websites. The web browsers Google Chrome, Konqueror, and Opera, the email client Kmail and the instant messaging client Pidgin also offer spell checking support, transparently using previously GNU Aspell and currently Hunspell as their engine. Mac OS X now has spell check system-wide, extending the service to virtually all bundled and third party applications.\n\nSome spell checkers have separate support for medical dictionaries to help prevent medical errors.\n\nThe first spell checkers were \"verifiers\" instead of \"correctors.\" They offered no suggestions for incorrectly spelled words. This was helpful for typos but it was not so helpful for logical or phonetic errors. The challenge the developers faced was the difficulty in offering useful suggestions for misspelled words. This requires reducing words to a skeletal form and applying pattern-matching algorithms.\n\nIt might seem logical that where spell-checking dictionaries are concerned, \"the bigger, the better,\" so that correct words are not marked as incorrect. In practice, however, an optimal size for English appears to be around 90,000 entries. If there are more than this, incorrectly spelled words may be skipped because they are mistaken for others. For example, a linguist might determine on the basis of corpus linguistics that the word \"baht\" is more frequently a misspelling of \"bath\" or \"bat\" than a reference to the Thai currency. Hence, it would typically be more useful if a few people who write about Thai currency were slightly inconvenienced than if the spelling errors of the many more people who discuss baths were overlooked.\n\nThe first MS-DOS spell checkers were mostly used in proofing mode from within word processing packages. After preparing a document, a user scanned the text looking for misspellings. Later, however, batch processing was offered in such packages as Oracle's short-lived CoAuthor and allowed a user to view the results after a document was processed and correct only the words that were known to be wrong. When memory and processing power became abundant, spell checking was performed in the background in an interactive way, such as has been the case with the Sector Software produced Spellbound program released in 1987 and Microsoft Word since Word 95.\n\nIn recent years, spell checkers have become increasingly sophisticated; some are now capable of recognizing simple grammatical errors. However, even at their best, they rarely catch all the errors in a text (such as homophone errors) and will flag neologisms and foreign words as misspellings. Nonetheless, spell checkers can be considered as a type of foreign language writing aid that non-native language learners can rely on to detect and correct their misspellings in the target language.\n\nEnglish is unusual in that most words used in formal writing have a single spelling that can be found in a typical dictionary, with the exception of some jargon and modified words. In many languages, words are often concatenated into new combinations of words. In German, compound nouns are frequently coined from other existing nouns. Some scripts do not clearly separate one word from another, requiring word-splitting algorithms. Each of these presents unique challenges to non-English language spell checkers.\n\n\nThe most successful algorithm to date is Andrew Golding and Dan Roth's \"Winnow-based spelling correction algorithm\", published in 1999, which is able to recognize about 96% of context-sensitive spelling errors, in addition to ordinary non-word spelling errors. A context-sensitive spell checker appears in Microsoft Office 2007, Google Wave, and in Ghotit Dyslexia Software context spell checker tuned for people with dyslexia.\n\nSome critics of technology and computers have attempted to link spell checkers to a trend of skill losses in writing, reading, and speaking. They claim that computers have made people lazy, often not proofreading written work except for a simple pass through a spell checker. Supporters claim that these changes may actually be beneficial to society, by making writing and learning new languages more accessible to ordinary people. They claim that the skills lost by the use of automated spell checkers are replaced by better skills, such as faster and more efficient research skills. Other supporters of technology point out that these skills are not being lost by people who use written language frequently in their work, such as authors and journalists.\n\nAn example of the folly of relying completely on spell checkers is shown in the Spell-checker Poem above. It was originally composed by Dr Jerrold H. Zar in 1991, assisted by Mark Eckman, with an original length of 225 words, and containing 123 incorrectly used words. According to most unsophisticated spell checkers, the poem is valid, but most people can tell at a simple glance that most words are used incorrectly. As a result, spell checkers are sometimes derided as spilling chuckers or similar, slightly misspelled names.\n\nNot all critics are opponents of technological progress, however. An article based on research by Galletta et al. reports that higher verbal skills are needed for highest performance when using a spell checker. The theory suggested that only writers with higher verbal skills could recognize and ignore false positives or incorrect suggestions. However, it was found that those with the higher skills lost their unaided performance advantage in multiple categories of errors, performing as poorly as the low verbals with the spell-checkers turned on. The conclusion points to some evidence of a loss of skill.\n\n\n"}

It employs a keyboard whose keys contain \"lexigrams\", symbols corresponding to objects or ideas.\n\nA lexigram represents a word but is not necessarily indicative of the object to which it refers. Lexigrams were notably used by the Georgia State University Language Research Center to communicate with bonobos and chimpanzees. Researchers and primates were able to communicate using lexigram boards made in up to three panels with a total of 384 keys.\n\nThe language was developed by Ernst von Glasersfeld and used by Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh of Georgia State University while working with primates at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Primates were taught to communicate by means of a lexigram board, a computerized array of keys labeled with lexigrams. Von Glasersfeld coined the term \"lexigram\" in 1971, created the first 120 of them, and designed the grammar that regulated their combination. This artificial language was called Yerkish in honor of Robert M. Yerkes, the founder of the laboratory within which the lexigrams were first used.\n\nThe first ape trained to communicate in Yerkish was the chimpanzee Lana, beginning in 1973 within the context of the LANA project. Von Glaserfeld created approximately 150 of the first words in the Yerkish language, and went on to use 25 of them in his initial experiment with Lana - a chimpanzee whom researchers were hoping would not only interpret the Yerkish language, but would also participate in communication with others through this newfound language. A keyboard was created for Lana with each key representing various nouns or verbs such as food, eat, apple, drink, etc. After pressing a certain key, the corresponding item would emerge from a food dispenser placed next to the keyboard, and through a series of experiments, researchers hoped that Lana would learn to interpret what each key would correlate to and learn to meaningfully communicate her requests.\n\n\n"}

Zaner was able to streamline the Spencerian script method—which was widely used in the 19th century—by adapting a handwriting approach that was more practicable for modern business documents and personal communication. Zaner’s enthusiasm about this utilitarian art inspired him to open a school that would prepare students for successful careers in the penmanship industry.\n\nIn 1891, Zaner sold shares of the Zanerian College of Penmanship to another skilled penman, Elmer Ward Bloser (forming the partnership that later created the Zaner-Bloser Company). While most penmanship schools at the time focused on training students for careers in ornamental writing, the Zanerian College emphasized the importance of an eclectic education by teaching psychology, physiology, and English composition.\n\nIn 1895, the Zanerian College of Penmanship became known as the Zaner-Bloser Company, which continued to offer penmanship courses and began publishing professional materials about handwriting and illustration and selling handwriting supplies. The Zaner & Bloser Company published \"The Zaner Method of Arm Movement Writing\" in 1904, making the simplified Zanerian writing style more readily accessible to children in elementary schools all over the United States.\n\nIn 1972, Zaner-Bloser, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Highlights for Children.\n\nCharles Paxton Zaner, born near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 1864, began showing a fondness for handwriting early in his youth. In 1882, he enrolled in G. W. Michael's Pen Art Hall in Oberlin, Ohio. After graduation, Zaner worked as a penman at two different business colleges before deciding to open his own school in 1888—the Zanerian College of Penmanship.\n\nIn 1889, fellow Master Penman Lloyd Kelchner became a partner with Zaner and two years later, Elmer Ward Bloser—another skilled penman—joined the partnership. That same year, Kelchner left the business arrangement, leading Zaner and Bloser to become equal partners in what had then become the Zaner-Bloser Company.\n\nZaner built a reputation for himself as a Master Penman. He maximized his exposure and recognition in the industry with monthly magazines that included countless lessons in penmanship and pen art, for which he enlisted the help of other industry experts. This, as well as numerous other endeavors, established Zaner as a pivotal figure in what is called the \"Golden Age of Ornamental Penmanship\".\n\nElmer Ward Bloser was born in 1865 and raised on his parents’ farm in Pennsylvania. His interest in writing was apparent even as a child, when he sold writing inks and supplies to neighborhood children. In 1883, Bloser began attending G.W. Michael’s Pen Art Hall, where his writing acumen eventually earned him a position as penmanship instructor.\n\nBloser’s penmanship career advanced with such success that he was considered one of the finest in the industry. In 1891, he purchased shares of the Zanerian College of Penmanship, which later became the Zaner-Bloser Company. After Charles Paxton Zaner's untimely death in 1918, Bloser purchased the company’s remaining shares and continued to manage Zaner-Bloser’s successful operation until his own death in 1929.\n"}
