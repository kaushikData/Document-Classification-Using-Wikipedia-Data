By 1994 the population had been reduced to two women aged over 50 living with the other few surviving Great Andamanese on Strait Island.\n\nThe Cari population at the time of first European contacts (in the 1790s) has been estimated at 100 individuals, out of perhaps 3500 Great Andamanese.\nLike other Andamanese peoples, the Cari were decimated during colonial and post-colonial times, by diseases, alcohol, colonial warfare and loss of territory. The population was down to 39 individuals in the 1901 census, falling to 36 in 1911, 17 in 1921, and 9 in 1931.\n\nIn 1949 any remaining Cari were relocated, together with all other surviving Great Andamanese, to a reservation on Bluff island; and then again in 1969 to a reservation on Strait Island.\n\nBy 1994, the tribe was reduced to only two women, aged 57 and 59, and therefore was on its way to extinction. They are a designated Scheduled Tribe.\n\nThe Great Andamanese languages are agglutinative languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system. They have a distinctive noun class system based largely on body parts, in which every noun and adjective may take a prefix according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the tongue. An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of \"yop\", \"pliable, soft\", in Aka-Bea: \nSimilarly, \"beri-nga\" \"good\" yields:\n\nThe prefixes are,\n\nBody parts are inalienably possessed, requiring a possessive adjective prefix to complete them, so one cannot say \"head\" alone, but only \"my, or his, or your, etc. head\".\n\nThe basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):\n'This' and 'that' are distinguished as \"k-\" and \"t-\".\n\nJudging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two cardinal numbers — one and two — and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.\n\n"}

A person who holds such positions is sometimes referred to as a \"Kurdophobe\".\n\nThe term, \"Anti-Kurdism\", appears to have been first coined by Gérard Chaliand who used it to describe the anti-Kurdish sentiment in Iraq and Turkey during the mid to late twentieth century.\n\nAnti-Kurdish sentiment appears to have first emerged as a result of fears surrounding Kurdish aspirations for an independent state called Kurdistan and in response to ultra-nationalist ideology promoted by the states in which Kurds live. The Turkish government institutionalized the racism and paid academics to teach false theories that would deny the existence of Kurds, such as the \"kurt-kart theory\". The theory claimed that Kurds were merely Turks whose name came from the \"kurt-kart\" sound the people made when they walked through the snow of the mountainous southeast of Turkey.\n\nVarious ultra-nationalist political parties and groups in Turkey have successfully campaigned using the general anti-Kurdish sentiment of the Turkish public.\n\nAnti-Kurdish sentiment increased in the Arab world during the formation of the United Arab Republic. At that time, Gamal Abdel Nasser implemented a policy of Arabizing the new republic by cracking down on Kurdish political dissent. Following the collapse of the United Arab Republic, Syria would be officially declared the Syrian Arab Republic based on these same policies.\n\nAnti-Kurdish sentiment has also been present in Iraq and Iran where there are large Kurdish populations. In Iraq, anti-Kurdism manifested itself in the form of genocide and Saddam Hussein's Anfal campaign. In modern Iran, anti-Kurdism culminated with the declaration by Ayatollah Khomeini that Kurds are the \"children of the jinn\", despite Kurds being an Iranic ethnic group.\n\nIn 2014-2015, Kurds were personally targeted in various instances due to Kurdish political groups and the Kurdistan Regional Government's alliance with Western countries. Kurds in Iraq and Syria have been embroiled in a war against the rebel group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. As a result of the increasing awareness of the Kurdish people due to this conflict, anti-Kurdism has also been on the rise. In the United Kingdom, a Kurdish shop owner was attacked by a kurdophobe who said he wished genocide against all Kurdish people.\n\nIn November 2014, a Kurdish footballer Deniz Naki was the victim of an attack in Turkey. Naki, who played for the Turkish club, Gençlerbirliği S.K., was attacked by Turks while he was out buying food in Turkey's capital, Ankara. The incident occurred shortly after Naki had declared that he was Kurdish and expressed support on social media for the Kurdish groups fighting against ISIS militants. A number of assailants allegedly cursed him and called him a \"dirty Kurd\" before beating him and injuring his hand and giving him a black eye. Naki has since left Turkey and returned to Europe where he intends to continue his football career.\n\n"}

For example:\n\nThe comma splice is sometimes used in literary writing to convey a particular mood of informality. Otherwise, it is usually considered an error in English writing style. Some authorities on English usage consider comma splices appropriate in limited situations, such as informal writing or with short similar phrases.\n\nComma splices are rare in most published writing but are common among inexperienced writers of English.\n\nThe original 1918 edition of \"The Elements of Style\" by William Strunk Jr. advises using a semicolon, not a comma, to join two grammatically complete clauses, except when the clauses are \"very short\" and \"similar in form\", for example:\n\nComma splices are similar to run-on sentences, which join two independent clauses without any punctuation and without a conjunction such as \"and\", \"but\" \"for\", etc. Sometimes the two types of sentences are treated differently based on the presence or absence of a comma, but most writers consider the comma splice as a special type of run-on sentence. According to \"Garner's Modern English Usage\": \n\nComma splices often arise when writers use conjunctive adverbs (such as \"furthermore\", \"however\", or \"moreover\") to separate two independent clauses instead of using a coordinating conjunction.\n\nComma splices are also occasionally used in fiction, poetry, and other forms of literature to convey a particular mood or informal style. Some authors use commas to separate short clauses only. The comma splice is more commonly found in works from the 18th and 19th century, when written prose mimicked speech more closely.\n\nFowler's Modern English Usage describes the use of the comma splice by the authors Elizabeth Jolley and Iris Murdoch:\n\nJournalist Oliver Kamm writes of novelist Jane Austen's use of the comma splice, \"Tastes in punctuation are not constant. It makes no sense to accuse Jane Austen of incorrect use of the comma, as no one would have levelled this charge against her at the time. Her conventions of usage were not ours\".\n\nThe author and journalist Lynne Truss writes in \"Eats Shoots & Leaves\" that \"so many highly respected writers observe the splice comma that a rather unfair rule emerges on this one: only do it if you're famous\". Citing Samuel Beckett, E. M. Forster, and Somerset Maugham, she says: \"Done knowingly by an established writer, the comma splice is effective, poetic, dashing. Done equally knowingly by people who are not published writers, it can look weak or presumptuous. Done ignorantly by ignorant people, it is awful\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22514129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22514129", "title": "Fuzzy matching (computer-assisted translation)", "text": "Fuzzy matching (computer-assisted translation)\n\nFuzzy matching is a technique used in computer-assisted translation as a special case of record linkage. It works with matches that may be less than 100% perfect when finding correspondences between segments of a text and entries in a database of previous translations. It usually operates at sentence-level segments, but some translation technology allows matching at a phrasal level. It is used when the translator is working with translation memory (TM). \n\nWhen an exact match cannot be found in the TM database for the text being translated, there is an option to search for a match that is less than exact; the translator sets the threshold of the fuzzy match to a percentage value less than 100%, and the database will then return any matches in its memory corresponding to that percentage. Its primary function is to assist the translator by speeding up the translation process; fuzzy matching is not designed to replace the human translator.\n\nBecause of the polymorphous and dynamic nature of language, particularly English (which accounts for 90% of all source texts undergoing translation in the localisation industry), methods are always being sought to make the translation process easier and faster. Since the late 1980s, translation memory tools have been developed to increase productivity and make the whole translation process faster for the translator. \n\nIn the 1990s, fuzzy matching began to take off as a prominent feature of TM tools, and despite some issues concerning the extra work involved in editing a fuzzy match \"proposal\", it is still a popular subset of TM. It is currently a feature of most popular TM tools.\n\nThe TM tool searches the database to locate segments that are an approximate match for a segment in a new source text to be translated. The TM, in effect, \"proposes\" the match to the translator; it is then up to the translator to accept this proposal or to edit this proposal to more fully equate with the new source text that is undergoing translation. In this way, fuzzy matching can speed up the translation process and lead to increased productivity. \n\nThis raises questions about the quality of the resulting translations. On occasions a translator is under pressure to deliver on time and is thus led to accept a fuzzy match proposal without checking its suitability and context. TM databases are built up by input from numerous different translators working on a variety of different texts, with a danger that sentences extracted from this word \"tapestry\" will be a stitched-together hodgepodge of styles, and the antithesis of the striven-after consistency – what some critics have dubbed \"sentence salad\". The question of faith in the TM's proposals can be a problem when trying to strike a balance between a faster translation process and the quality of that translation. Nevertheless, fuzzy matching is still an important part of the translator's tool-kit.\n\n"}
{"id": "440006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=440006", "title": "Führerprinzip", "text": "Führerprinzip\n\nThe Führerprinzip (German for \"leader principle\") prescribed the fundamental basis of political authority in the governmental structures of the Third Reich. This principle can be most succinctly understood to mean that \"the \"Führer\"s word is above all written law\" and that governmental policies, decisions, and offices ought to work toward the realization of this end. In actual political usage, it refers mainly to the practice of dictatorship within the ranks of a political party itself, and as such, it has become an earmark of political fascism.\n\nThe \"Führerprinzip\" was not invented by the Nazis. Hermann von Keyserling, an ethnically German philosopher from Estonia, was the first to use the term. One of Keyserling's central claims was that certain \"gifted individuals\" were \"born to rule\" on the basis of Social Darwinism.\n\nThe ideology of the \"Führerprinzip\" sees each organization as a hierarchy of leaders, where every leader (\"Führer\", in German) has absolute responsibility in his own area, demands absolute obedience from those below him and answers only to his superiors. This required obedience and loyalty even over concerns of right and wrong. The supreme leader, Adolf Hitler, answered to God and the German people. Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has argued that Hitler saw himself as an incarnation of \"auctoritas\", and as the living law or highest law itself, effectively combining in his persona executive power, judicial power and legislative power. After the campaign against the alleged Röhm Putsch, Hitler declared: \"in this hour, I was responsible for the fate of the German nation and was therefore the supreme judge of the German people!\"\n\nThe \"Führerprinzip\" paralleled the functionality of military organizations, which continue to use a similar authority structure today, although in democratic countries members are supposed to be restrained by codes of conduct. The \"Freikorps\" – German paramilitary organizations made up of men who had fought in World War I and been mustered out after Germany's defeat, but who found it impossible to return to civilian life – were run on the Fuehrer Principle. Many of the same men had, earlier in life, been part of various German youth groups in the period from 1904-1913. These groups had also accepted the idea of blind obedience to a leader. The justification for the civil use of the \"Führerprinzip\" was that unquestioning obedience to superiors supposedly produced order and prosperity in which those deemed 'worthy' would share.\n\nIn the case of the Nazis, the \"Führerprinzip\" became integral to the Nazi Party in July 1921, when Adolf Hitler forced a showdown with the original leaders of the party after he learned that they were attempting to merge it with the somewhat larger German Socialist Party. Learning of this, and knowing that any merger would dilute his influence over the group, Hitler quit the Nazis. Realizing that the party would be completely ineffective without Hitler as their front man, the founder of the party, Anton Drexler, opened negotiations with Hitler, who delivered an ultimatum: he must be recognized as the sole leader (\"Führer\") of the party, with dictatorial powers. The executive committee gave in to his demands, and Hitler rejoined the party a few days later to become its permanent ruler, with Drexler kicked upstairs to be honorary chairman for life.\n\nIn time, as the party expanded, it fragmented somewhat, with the northern faction led by the Strasser brothers, Otto and Gregor, and including Joseph Goebbels, holding more socialist views then the southern faction controlled by Hitler in Munich. They differed in other ways as well, including on the party's acceptance of the Fuehrer Principle. In another confrontation engineered by Hitler, a party conference was called on February 14, 1926 in Bamberg. At this conference, Hitler won over the leaders of the northern faction with his oratorical skills, and the question of whether the NSDAP would follow the \"Führerprinzip\" was put to rest for good. \n\nWhen Hitler finally came to absolute power, after being appointed Chancellor and assuming the powers of the President when Paul von Hindenburg died, he changed his title to \"Fuehrer and Reich Chancellor\", and the \"Führerprinzip\" became an integral part of German society. Appointed mayors replaced elected local governments. Schools lost elected parents' councils and faculty advisory boards, with all authority being put in the headmaster's hands. The Nazis suppressed associations and unions with elected leaders, putting in their place mandatory associations with appointed leaders. The authorities allowed private corporations to keep their internal organization, but with a simple renaming from hierarchy to \"Führerprinzip\". Conflicting associations, e.g. sports associations responsible for the same sport, were \"coordinated\" into a single one under the leadership of a single \"Führer\", who appointed the \"Führer\" of a regional association, who appointed the sports club Führer, often appointing the person whom the club had previously elected. Shop stewards had their authority carefully circumscribed to prevent their infringing on that of the plant leader. Eventually, virtually no activity or organization in Germany could exist that was completely independent of party and/or state leadership.\n\nHermann Göring told Nevile Henderson that \"When a decision has to be taken, none of us counts more than the stones on which we are standing. It is the Führer alone who decides\". In practice, the selection of unsuitable candidates often led to micromanagement and commonly to an inability to formulate coherent policy. Albert Speer noted that many Nazi officials dreaded making decisions in Hitler's absence. Rules tended to become oral rather than written; leaders with initiative who flouted regulations and carved out their own spheres of influence might receive praise and promotion rather than censure.\n\nMany propaganda films developed the importance of the \"Führerprinzip\". \"Flüchtlinge\" depicted Volga German refugees saved from Communist persecution by a leader demanding unquestioning obedience. \"Der Herrscher\" altered its source material to depict its hero, Clausen, as the unwavering leader of his munitions firm, who, faced with his children's machinations, disowns them and bestows the firm on the state, confident that a worker will arise capable of continuing his work and, as a true leader, needing no instruction. \"Carl Peters\" shows the title character in firm, decisive action to hold and win African colonies, but brought down by a parliament that does not realize the necessity of \"Führerprinzip\".\n\nIn the schools, adolescent boys were presented with Nordic sagas as the illustration of \"Führerprinzip\", which was developed with such heroes as Frederick the Great and Otto von Bismarck.\n\nThis combined with the glorification of the one, central \"Führer\". During the Night of Long Knives, it was claimed that his decisive action saved Germany, though it meant (in Goebbels's description) suffering \"tragic loneliness\" from being a Siegfried forced to shed blood to preserve Germany. In one speech Robert Ley explicitly proclaimed \"The Führer is always right.\" Booklets given out for the Winter Relief donations included \"The Führer Makes History\", a collection of Hitler photographs, and \"The Führer’s Battle in the East\" Films such as \"Der Marsch zum Führer\" and \"Triumph of the Will\" glorified him.\n\nCarl Schmitt – drawn to the Nazi party by his admiration for a decisive leader praised him in his pamphlet \"State, Volk and Movement\" because only the ruthless will of such a leader could save Germany and its people from the \"asphalt culture\" of modernity, to bring about unity and authenticity.\n\nDuring the post-war Nuremberg Trials, Nazi war criminals—and, later, Adolf Eichmann during the trial in Israel—used the \"Führerprinzip\" concept to argue that they were not guilty of war crimes by claiming that they were only following orders. Eichmann may have declared his conscience was inconvenienced by war events in order to \"do his job\" as best he could. \n\nIn \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\", Hannah Arendt concluded that, aside from a desire for improving his career, Eichmann showed no trace of anti-Semitism or psychological abnormalities whatsoever. She called him the embodiment of the \"banality of evil\", as he appeared at his trial to have an ordinary and common personality, displaying neither guilt nor hatred, denying any form of responsibility. Eichmann argued he was simply \"doing his job\" and maintained he had always tried to act in accordance with Kant's categorical imperative. Arendt suggested that these statements most strikingly discredit the idea that Nazi criminals were manifestly psychopathic and different from common people, that even the most ordinary of people can commit horrendous crimes if placed in the catalyzing situation, and given the correct incentives. However, Arendt disagreed with this interpretation, as Eichmann justified himself with the \"Führerprinzip\". Arendt argued that children obey, whereas adults adhere to an ideology.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

The SP0256 includes 2 KB of mask ROM. The various versions of SP0256 differ primarily in the voice data programmed into their mask ROMs.\n\nThe SP0256 (and its predecessor, the SP0250) implement a 12-pole, Linear Predictive Coding (aka LPC-12) all-pole Vocal Tract Model (VTM). The SP0256 generates speech with a 10 kHz sample rate. The SP0256 realizes its 12-pole filter with a series of cascaded 2-pole IIR filter sections. This is in contrast to its contemporaries, such as Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips, which used an 8 kHz sample rate with a 10-pole model, and realized their VTM with a lattice filter.\n\nThe SP0256 combines the VTM with a simple controller that loads compressed coefficient data into the VTM, either from the on-chip ROM, external speech ROMs such as the SPR-128, or in the case of the Intellivoice, an SPB640 speech data FIFO.\n\nGeneral Instrument made several variants of the SP0256. These variants differed primarily in their mask ROM content. Listed below are some known variants. Others likely exist that aren't listed on this page.\n\nThe SP0256-AL2 is perhaps the most commonly encountered variant. It contains 59 allophones primarily intended for use with English language phrases and five pauses in its internal 16 KB ROM. The SP0256-AL2 needs the control of an external microprocessor to concatenate allophones into words.\n\nThe SP0256-AL2 was available in home brew kits for speech synthesis published in specialized magazines for microcomputers such as the VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family. Other companies produced add-ons for various 8-bit microcomputers, like Currah MicroSpeech and the Tandy Speech/Sound Program Pak for the TRS-80. The chip was also sold under the Archer brand by RadioShack stores as the \"Narrator Speech Processor\" (part number 276-1784), where earlier documentation incorrectly identified it as the SPO256 (with the letter \"O\" instead of the numeral \"0\").\n\nMattel's Intellivoice attachment for its Intellivision video game system uses the SP0256-012. This variant contains only Mattel-specific game phrases, including the energetic phrase \"Mattel Electronics Presents,\" phrases for digits, and a couple additional game phrases. It does not contain the allophones found in the SP0256-AL2 or SP0256-019. Mattel only released five games with support for this device.\n\nThe SP0256-017 comes from a talking clock, and contains phrases specific to the talking clock. The SP0256-017 was sold by Radio Shack under the Archer brand as part number 276-1783. The part set also contained the SPR016-117, an external serial speech ROM. The vocabulary included the numbers (in combination) through 59, appropriate for a spoken clock. The onboard memory also provided for synthesizing the following phrases: A.M., P.M., It is, Hour, Minute, Hundred Hour, Good Morning, Attention Please, Please Hurry, and three Melodies named A, B and C.\n\nThe Magnavox Odyssey²'s The Voice attachment uses the SP0256-019. This variant included the same allophones as the SP0256-AL2 (but an external ROM IC is required for the allophones), along with some Odyssey²-specific game phrases.\n\nAn FPGA implementation of a classic eighties speech synthesizer SP0256, done for the Retro Challenge October 2017 by Niels Moseley, is available on his github.\n\n"}

The term is sometimes incorrectly used to describe a word that occurs in just one of an author's works, but more than once in that particular work. \"Hapax legomenon\" is a transliteration of Greek , meaning \"(something) being said (only) once\".\n\nThe related terms dis legomenon, tris legomenon, and tetrakis legomenon respectively (, , ) refer to double, triple, or quadruple occurrences, but are far less commonly used.\n\n\"Hapax legomena\" are quite common, as predicted by Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of any word in a corpus is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. For large corpora, about 40% to 60% of the words are \"hapax legomena\", and another 10% to 15% are \"dis legomena\". Thus, in the Brown Corpus of American English, about half of the 50,000 distinct words are \"hapax legomena\" within that corpus.\n\n\"Hapax legomenon\" refers to a word's appearance in a body of text, not to either its origin or its prevalence in speech. It thus differs from a nonce word, which may never be recorded, may find currency and may be widely recorded, or may appear several times in the work which coins it, and so on.\n\n\"Hapax legomena\" in ancient texts are usually difficult to decipher, since it is easier to infer meaning from multiple contexts than from just one. For example, many of the remaining undeciphered Mayan glyphs are \"hapax legomena\", and Biblical (particularly Hebrew; see § Hebrew examples) \"hapax legomena\" sometimes pose problems in translation. \"Hapax legomena\" also pose challenges in natural language processing.\n\nSome scholars consider \"Hapax legomena\" useful in determining the authorship of written works. P. N. Harrison, in \"The Problem of the Pastoral Epistles\" (1921) made \"hapax legomena\" popular among Bible scholars, when he argued that there are considerably more of them in the three Pastoral Epistles than in other Pauline Epistles. He argued that the number of \"hapax legomena\" in a putative author's corpus indicates his or her vocabulary and is characteristic of the author as an individual.\n\nHarrison's theory has faded in significance due to a number of problems raised by other scholars. For example, in 1896, W. P. Workman found the following numbers of \"hapax legomena\" in each Pauline Epistle: Rom. 113, I Cor. 110, II Cor. 99, Gal. 34, Eph. 43 Phil. 41, Col. 38, I Thess. 23, II Thess. 11, Philem. 5, I Tim. 82, II Tim. 53, Titus 33. At first glance, the last three totals (for the Pastoral Epistles) are not out of line with the others. To take account of the varying length of the epistles, Workman also calculated the average number of \"hapax legomena\" per page of the Greek text, which ranged from 3.6 to 13, as summarized in the diagram on the right. Although the Pastoral Epistles have more \"hapax legomena\" per page, Workman found the differences to be moderate in comparison to the variation among other Epistles. This was reinforced when Workman looked at several plays by Shakespeare, which showed similar variations (from 3.4 to 10.4 per page of Irving's one-volume edition), as summarized in the second diagram on the right.\n\nApart from author identity, there are several other factors that can explain the number of \"hapax legomena\" in a work:\n\nIn the particular case of the Pastoral Epistles, all of these variables are quite different from those in the rest of the Pauline corpus, and \"hapax legomena\" are no longer widely accepted as strong indicators of authorship (although the authorship of the Pastorals is subject to debate on other grounds).\n\nThere are also subjective questions over whether two forms amount to \"the same word\": dog vs. dogs, clue vs. clueless, sign vs. signature; many other gray cases also arise. The \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" points out that, although there are 1,500 \"hapaxes\" in the Hebrew Bible, only about 400 are not obviously related to other attested word forms.\n\nIt would not be especially difficult for a forger to construct a work with any percentage of \"hapax legomena\" desired. However, it seems unlikely that forgers much before the 20th century would have conceived such a ploy, much less thought it worth the effort.\n\nA final difficulty with the use of \"hapax legomena\" for authorship determination is that there is considerable variation among works known to be by a single author, and disparate authors often show similar values. In other words, \"hapax legomena\" are not a reliable indicator. Authorship studies now usually use a wide range of measures to look for patterns rather than rely upon single measurements.\n\nIn the fields of computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP), esp. corpus linguistics and machine-learned NLP, it is common to disregard \"hapax legomena\" (and sometimes other infrequent words), as they are likely to have little value for computational techniques. This disregard has the added benefit of significantly reducing the memory use of an application, since, by Zipf's law, many words are hapax legomena.\n\nThe following are some examples of \"hapax legomena\" in languages or corpora.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are about 1,500 Hapax legomena in the Hebrew Bible; however, due to Hebrew roots, suffixes and prefixes, only 400 are \"true\" hapax legomena. A full list can be seen at the Jewish Encyclopedia entry for \"Hapax Legomena.\"\n\nSome examples include:\n\n\nThe strength of word building in the structure of the Irish language makes it relatively easy to create words ad hoc. A common wordplay game, played at poetry festivals such as the Galway Arts Festival, is to give short orations or recite short poems using as many hapax legomena as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A kiss was then placed upon the cross, by the signer as a display of their sworn oath. It was also used in early Christian history as much of a display of the same. \n\nSince most of the common people could not read or write, the 'X' was placed on documents, and a kiss was placed over it as a show of their sincerity. The Chi Rho, often represented with the letter 'X', was also used as a holy symbol throughout Christian history as it represented the Greek word for Christ \"ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ\"; this gave rise to the practice of using the letter 'X', which was then kissed in this tradition of displaying a sacred oath.\n\nThere is speculation on the Internet from at least one original source that the 'O' is of North American descent: when arriving in the United States, Jewish immigrants, most of whose first language was Yiddish, would use an 'O' to sign documents, thus not using the sign of the cross, and shop keepers would often use an 'O' when signing documents, in place of an 'X'.\n\n"}

Instead of signing the official script, Dmytruk instead signed to viewers \"Our president is Viktor Yushchenko. Do not trust the results of the central election committee. They are all lies.\" Dmytruk's act of defiance has been regarded as one of several catalysts for many Ukrainian journalists who subsequently rejected doctored news reports in favour of a more balanced reporting.\n\nDmytruk is the daughter of deaf parents and is the mother of two children, a son and daughter. Dmytruk both speaks and signs.\n\nShe was a barely known sign language interpreter at the Ukrainian state-run channel UT1 but became instantly famous during the live news broadcast on November 24, 2004, when she refused to translate the official script that announced Viktor Yanukovych as the winner of the presidential election.

Hundreds of her colleagues at UT-1 who were inspired by Dmytruk's action confronted the network's owners, chanting, \"No more lies!\" Within days UT1 had changed to a balanced reporting style. Following her act, many other news reporters in the broadcast media run or controlled by the state or the oligarchs who supported Yanukovych refused to participate in the production of the doctored news reports.

Such a playoff is either a single game or a short series of games (such as best-2-of-3).\n\nThis is distinguished from the more general usage of the term \"playoff\", which refers to the post-season tournament itself.\n\nOne-game playoffs are currently used in Major League Baseball (MLB). When two or more MLB teams are tied for a division championship or the wild card playoff berth (1995–2011, or starting in 2012, the second only) at the end of the regular season, a one-game playoff is used to determine the winner.\n\nIf a tie were (from 1995-2011) a two-way tie for a division championship and both tied teams' have records higher than those records of the second-place teams in the other divisions, or (from 2012) between the two division non-champions with the untied best record, there is no one-game playoff. In this scenario, the winner of the season series between the two teams is deemed to win the tie for purposes of playoff seeding. Through the 2008 season, home-field advantage for one-game playoffs was determined by a coin flip, but effective in , home advantage is based on a set of performance criteria, with the first tiebreaker being head-to-head record.\n\nFor statistical purposes, one-game playoffs are considered part of the regular season. The result of the playoff is included in the regular season standings and individual player statistics are included along with the statistics for the rest of the season. One significant playoff-like deviation from normal regular season games in force is that six-man umpire crews are used (as opposed to the four-man crews of the regular season). Also, television broadcasting rights for all are negotiated by MLB - since 2012, the network owning the rights to the Wild Card Game for a particular league has also had the rights to any tiebreaker(s) that might occur in that league.\n\nCurrent MLB scheduling practices stipulate a break of at least one day between the scheduled end of the regular season and the start of the postseason. The schedule is designed to maximize the probability that tiebreakers can take place on the day after the scheduled end of the regular season with no alterations to the postseason schedule needing to be made as a result. Nevertheless, the schedule can be disrupted if rain-outs or other such events disrupt the schedule near the end of the season or on the day set aside for tiebreakers, and the tie-breaking procedure and scheduling would become more complicated if three or more teams tie. This would require a series of one-game playoffs, taking more than one day. A series of one-game playoffs would also be necessary if teams tied for their division title also tied for the second wild card - in such a case, the division title would be settled first, with the loser of that game then contesting a tiebreaker for the wild card berth. There have been several occasions where such scenarios were possible as late as the last game of the season, but it has not yet happened. To provide some additional flexibility in case of make-up games and/or complicated playoff scenarios, an additional break of one day is always scheduled between the wild card game and the start of the Division Series in each league. \n\nStarting in 2012, with the Wild Card game between the top two teams who did not win their division, if two teams tie for a division title and would both be in the playoffs, a one-game playoff would be held because it would determine which team receives the bye in the playoff, and if the winning percentage of the losing team is still enough to be a #1 or #2 wild card, the loser would be play in the wild card game. When two teams tie for the top two wild card positions, an extra game is not held - performance-based criteria is used in that case to determine the home team for the Wild Card Game.\n\nFinally, although tiebreaker games count in the regular season standings, they do \"not\" count for the purposes of determining subsequent postseason qualification, seeding and home field advantage. For example, should two teams tie for their division title and also tie with the runner-up of another division for the wild card, the loser of the division tiebreaker can still host the team tied for the wild card (whether in another tiebreaker for the second wild card or in the Wild Card Game itself) based on performance-based criteria, even though in that scenario though they will have technically lost one more regular season game and therefore be a half game behind in the standings. However, if a team in such a scenario were to lose a divisional tiebreaker and then win a tiebreaker for the second wild card, it would actually finish a half game behind the division winner and a half game ahead of third place in the wild card standings. \n\nAvoiding any confusion with the term \"Playoffs\" as the oft-used but unofficial name of MLB's post-season tournament, the term \"Tiebreaker\" is MLB's preferred term for a one-game playoff.\n\nThrough the 2013 MLB season, there have been 14 occasions where a playoff was needed to break a tie in a league, division, or wild card race. Of these playoffs, ten have been one-game playoffs and the other four were three-game playoffs. Prior to the advent of divisional play in 1969, the National League broke ties for its league championship with a best-of-three-games playoff - incidentally, all four of these series were ultimately won by the team that won the first game. The American League has always used one-game playoffs.\n\nPrior to the wild card playoff system, all five pennant playoffs in the National League had involved the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers (who won the coin toss for home field advantage all five times, yet lost every year except 1959), and both American League playoffs had involved the Boston Red Sox (who hosted both and lost both).\n\nThe 2018 season was the first to see two one-game playoffs, both for division titles - the first time divisional one-game playoffs were needed at all since the MLB postseason expanded to ten teams. Both were in the National League and meant that the Game 163 winners won the division and advanced to the LDS, while the losers met each other in the Wild Card Game. It was the first time that the loser of a tie-breaker game still qualified for the playoffs.\n\nSince the advent of the wild card in 1995, there have been three occasions on which a tiebreaker was not necessary as the two teams that were tied for a division lead were also atop the wild card standings. In 2001, the Houston Astros and St. Louis Cardinals tied for first in the National League Central with records of 93–69. In 2005, the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox each finished 95–67 in the American League East. In 2006, the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers finished tied with records of 88–74 in the National League West. In all three situations, the team with the better head-to-head record (the 2001 Astros, 2005 Yankees, and 2006 Padres) were declared winners of the division, thus receiving a better seed in the postseason. The other team (the 2001 Cardinals, 2005 Red Sox, and 2006 Dodgers) entered the postseason as the wild card.\n\nSince 2012, when the Wild Card Game was introduced, if two teams are tied atop the Wild Card standings, both would qualify for the Wild Card Game and no tiebreaker game would be necessary. The team who won the regular season series would host the Wild Card game. This has occurred in 2012 (Baltimore Orioles and Texas Rangers were both 93–69, Texas was awarded home field advantage due to winning the season series) and 2016 (Baltimore Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays were both 89–73, Toronto was awarded home field advantage due to winning the season series). Under the pre-2012 series, these match-ups would have been played as tiebreaker games at the same venues.\n\nOn some occasions a previously postponed game may be made up at the end of the season in order to settle entry into the playoffs. Although such a game is technically a mere regular-season game, it can have the effect and feel of a playoff.\n\nOn September 23, 1908, Johnny Evers of the Chicago Cubs capitalized on a base-running mistake by young Fred Merkle of the New York Giants to invalidate a game-ending winning run. As thousands of fans were on the field and darkness was approaching, the game did not immediately resume. As it turned out, the Cubs and Giants ended the season in a tie for the pennant, and the postponed game was replaced by a new game played on October 8, 1908, at the Polo Grounds. The Cubs prevailed 4–2, and advanced to the 1908 World Series.\n\nIn 2008, the Chicago White Sox ended the season 1/2 game behind the Minnesota Twins for the American League Central division title. The fractional difference was due to the September 13 game between the White Sox and the Detroit Tigers, which had been rained out and not yet rescheduled. To determine whether, if the game had not been rained out, there would have been a tie between the Twins and White Sox, the White Sox and Tigers played the make-up game at the end of the season on September 29. The White Sox won, resulting in a Twins–White Sox tie that necessitated playing a one-game playoff in Chicago, which the White Sox won 1-0. Make-up games were also played after the season's end in 1973 and 1981.\n\nBetween 1901 and 1938, during a time when games were more often delayed by darkness and not always made up, there have been at least nine occasions on which making up postponed games might have resulted in a different pennant outcome, but the games were not made up. Even today, make-up games that cannot be re-scheduled before the end of the season are only played if there is a possibility their results could affect postseason qualification.\n\nThe National Football League now has an elaborate formula for breaking ties in the qualification for its playoffs. One game playoffs are no longer possible – in the highly unlikely event that two teams tied in all relevant statistical criteria, the rules stipulate that a coin toss settle the tie. However, before the merger of the National Football League and the American Football League in 1970, it was possible to have a playoff game if 2 teams tied for a division title. The NFL had 9 of these playoffs occur between 1941 and 1965. The AFL, whose records were fully integrated with the NFL's upon merger, had 2 playoffs in 1963 and 1968. The All-America Football Conference, which merged with the NFL after the 1949 season (with the NFL absorbing three of the AAFC's franchises – the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and the original Baltimore Colts) also held a playoff tiebreaker game in 1948. Unlike the AFL's playoff games, the AAFC's are not recognized as NFL records by the older league.\n\nThe Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans of the National Football League tied at the end of the 1932 season. They held an extra game to determine the champion. Unlike subsequent post-season playoffs, this game was considered part of the regular season, as are the baseball tie-breaking playoff games described above.\n\nThe great interest generated by the 1932 playoff game led the NFL to split into two divisions in 1933, and began playing a single post-season NFL Championship game. If two teams in a single division tied for first place, the rules also provided for a one-game tie-breaking playoff to determine which team would advance to the league championship game. (The NFL did have at least one tiebreaker prior to this, one that came into play for determining the 1921 title; if two teams tied each other in the standings and played twice, each winning one, the winner of the second game wins the title. This could not be used for 1932 because the Bears and Spartans had tied each other in their two matchups that year, and it is unknown when the NFL abandoned it.) This was the practice from 1933 to 1966. Unlike the 1932 contest, these tiebreakers were not part of the regular season's standings. The league's last one game playoff occurred in 1965. Since 1967, when it split into 4 divisions, the NFL has used a set of tiebreaking rules to break ties. The AFL did not adopt tiebreakers before the merger.\n\nTo this day in the NFL, division winners and playoff qualifiers are technically determined by winning percentage and not by number of wins. Prior to the merger, ties did not count for the purposes of this calculation. So, for example, one team finished 11-3 and another 10-2-2, there would have been no tiebreaker - the team with two ties would have been deemed the outright division winner. This made tie games (a fairly common occurrence in football before overtime was introduced) somewhat more valuable to teams compared to the half-win they are considered today. Even today, two ties are of exactly equal strength to a win for the purpose of breaking ties since, unlike many other North American leagues, the current NFL tiebreaking criteria do not prioritize one win over two ties (or vice versa) in any way. \n\nBoth the NFL and AFL had provisions prior to their merger to allow for two weeks of one-game playoffs if three or four teams tied for a division title. Despite the relatively high probability of such a tie happening in a 12 or 14 game schedule compared to in a longer season, this scenario never took place prior to the abolition of one-game playoffs. The closest a three way tie for a division came to happening was in 1957 when the Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts all entered the final week of the season with identical 7-4 records. With none of those three teams playing each other in the last week, a three-way tie seemed likely, however, the Colts lost their final game leaving the Lions and 49ers to contest the playoff between themselves.\n\nWhile there are no one game playoffs in the NFL today, current scheduling practices (which include exclusively intradivisional matchups at the end of the season) combined with the NFL's short schedule make it possible that the last week of the regular season will include a winner-take-all game between two teams, which will have the effect and feel of a playoff. Typically, such games will be scheduled for prime time under the NFL's flixible scheduling policy. For example, the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys entered the final week of the 2011 NFL season tied at 8-7 for first place in the NFC East. The teams, scheduled to play in Dallas, were not contention for a wild card berth, meaning the winner of the game would win the division while the losing team would miss the playoffs altogether. The Giants defeated the Coyboys in the game, and went on to win Super Bowl XLVI. \n\nHome teams in bold.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>\"During the time that tie-breaker games were in use, NFL teams were grouped into both \"Divisions\" (from 1933–1949), and \"Conferences\" (1950 and later).\"\n\nHome team in bold.\n\nHome team in bold.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>\"Not to be confused with the modern day Buffalo Bills or Indianapolis Colts, the latter of whom were originally based in Baltimore and joined the NFL three years after the AAFC Colts folded, while the current Buffalo Bills joined the NFL 20 years after the AAFC team folded.\"\n\nLike in the NFL, one game tiebreaking playoffs were a regular feature in the early years of the provincial competitions that were eventually consolidated into the Canadian Football League. They were abandoned in the mid-1930s as Canadian football evolved from consisting of provincial leagues to two regional conferences (the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and Western Interprovincial Football Union). Previously, the regional Eastern and Western champions that played in the Grey Cup were determined by playoffs between the winners of each region's leagues. These regional playoffs were sufficiently popular (and the teams were so dependent on gate receipts in the then-short season available to play football in Canada) that the regional conferences implemented a format that ensured playoffs were contested every season as opposed to only those where ties needed to be broken.\n\nThe current tiebreaking criteria are substantially different in the CFL compared to the NFL, although like the NFL it culminates in a coin toss in the highly unlikely event all specified performance-based criteria cannot break a tie at the end of the regular season. Also unlike the NFL, the CFL and its antecedent competitions have always awarded \"points\" the standings in the same manner as is done in ice hockey (which is by far Canada's most popular sport) as well as other codes of football especially rugby from which the gridiron codes evolved. Teams receive two points for a win and one for a tie. Starting in 2000, the CFL also experimented with awarding a point for an overtime loss as is typically done in hockey today, but dropped the \"OTL\" point after only three seasons. A tie has therefore always effectively counted as a \"half-win\" in the standings in Canadian football, with the caveat that in all tie-breakers in force since the end of tiebreaking playoffs, the first tiebreaker (other than for determining a crossover team) has always been number of wins (same as in hockey) whereas, as mentioned earlier, number of wins compared to ties has never been a tiebreaking criterium in the NFL.\n\nIn its early years, the National Basketball Association held tie-breaker games at the end of the season, if necessary. The first two games (a three team playoff) were played during the 1947–48 season, the leagues second year in existence, when it was still known as the Basketball Association of America. The second of these, however, was only used to determine the playoff seeding for the Chicago Stags and Baltimore Bullets. In fact, five of the seven one-game playoffs in NBA history were used for seeding purposes, and both teams advanced to the playoffs despite the outcome.\n\nThe American Basketball Association, which formed in 1967, did not hold a tie-breaker game in its first season, when the Kentucky Colonels and New Jersey Americans (later known as the New York Nets, New Jersey Nets, and currently as the Brooklyn Nets) tied for fourth place in the Eastern Division with a record of 36–42. A game was scheduled between the two teams in New Jersey, but the Americans' facility was booked and the replacement site picked by the team was in such poor condition that they were forced to forfeit the game by the league office. The Colonels were given the playoff spot despite going just 4–7 against the Americans during the regular season. The next time two teams finished tied for the final playoff spot in a division, the ABA did hold a tie-breaker game. The ABA would later merge with the NBA, with four teams from the ABA joining the NBA: the Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, New York Nets and San Antonio Spurs.\n\nHome team in bold.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>\"Not to be confused with the modern day Washington Wizards, who were known as the Baltimore Bullets from 1965 to 1973.\"\n\nHome team in bold.\n\nThe New Jersey Americans (now the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA) forfeited the 1968 playoff game to the Kentucky Colonels when the Commack Arena on Long Island, where the game was scheduled to be played, was deemed unsuitable due to a wet floor from a leaky ice hockey surface.\n\nThough the National Hockey League, currently the only major professional ice hockey league in North America, has never actually held a one-game playoff in its century long existence, its current playoff qualification rules explicitly allow for the possibility. Under current rules, a tie between two teams for a conference's final playoff berth (this being the second wild card seed of a conference under the current format) can only be broken by the first three tie-breakers - regulation and overtime wins (ROW), head-to-head results , and overall goal differential. Prior to the 2005 introduction of the shootout in the NHL, ROW was simply referred to as \"wins\" for tiebreaker purposes. The right to host such a game would be determined by a random draw.\n\nLike in MLB, such a game in the NHL would be considered a regular season game for statistical purposes with the caveat that the points earned would not count for playoff seeding purposes - in other words, the winner would enter the playoffs as the second wild card even if the two points they earned nominally caused them to otherwise tie or overtake other qualifying teams in total points and the loser would be eliminated even if they lost in overtime and the single point they earned nominally allowed them tie or overtake other qualifying teams in a similar manner. The other main difference from an ordinary regular season game is that playoff overtime rules (that is, unlimited periods of five-on-five play with no possibility of a shootout) would be used if necessary.\n\nA one game playoff would not be held simply to determine playoff seeding and/or draft lottery position for non-playoff teams - League rules in these cases mandate a more exhaustive set of tiebreakers culminating in a random drawing to determine playoff seeding and/or final regular season standing. The more exhaustive set of tiebreakers would also be used in the extremely unlikely event three or more teams in a conference tied in points, ROW, head-to-head results and overall goal differential for one or two playoff berths. In this case the more exhaustive criteria would be used to determine the club(s) which would qualify (in case of two available berths) or not qualify (in case of one available berth) without playing a one-game playoff, which would then be held between the two remaining teams if and only if they were also tied between each other in ROW, head-to-head results and overall goal differential. It is therefore not even remotely possible for there to be two or more one-game playoffs in a conference in a particular season.\n\nIn its modern era, the NHL has provisionally scheduled a one-game playoff near the end of the regular season on two occasions. Neither such playoff proved to be necessary.\n\nIn 2000, the Buffalo Sabres and Montreal Canadiens entered the final weekend of the regular season with the possibility of being tied for the final playoff spot and deadlocked on all relevant tiebreakers (wins, head-to-head results, and overall goal differential). The league announced that, if necessary, a tiebreaker game would be played the day after the regular season, but the Canadiens' loss in their final game rendered the point moot.\n\nLikewise, in 2018, if the Florida Panthers had won their last two games via shootout and the Philadelphia Flyers lost their last game by exactly two goals, the teams would have been equal in all tiebreaker criteria, and would have contested a play-in game for the second wild card in the Eastern Conference. This was avoided when the Flyers won their final game of the regular season and clinched the last playoff berth in the conference, eliminating Florida from playoff contention.\n\nThe NHL's most significant rival in its modern era, the World Hockey Association, actually held a one game playoff. The playoff was hastily added at the end of the inaugural regular season after two teams, the Alberta Oilers (now Edmonton Oilers) and the Minnesota Fighting Saints tied for points, wins and head-to-head record, these being the only tie-breakers stipulated in WHA rules. The Fighting Saints defeated the Oilers in the game, which was played in Calgary. The ad hoc nature of the game was controversial. Had the NHL tiebreakers been in effect, the Oilers would have qualified for the playoffs since they had superior goal differential — critics argued that the real reason the league ordered the playoff was that they wanted to give the Fighting Saints an extra chance to qualify on account of the fact that they were playing in a large, brand new arena whereas the Oilers were playing in a small and antiquated facility.\n\nAs a footnote, the Fighting Saints went on to play the Winnipeg Jets, who defeated them four games to one. This would turn out to be the only hockey playoff series between any two professional teams representing these two relatively nearby geographical cross-border locales until the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs. The 1972–73 season remains the only time a tiebreaking game has been played in a major North American hockey league. The WHA would later merge with the NHL, with four WHA franchises switching leagues: the Oilers, the Hartford Whalers (now the Carolina Hurricanes), the Quebec Nordiques (now the Colorado Avalanche), and the Jets (now the Arizona Coyotes and unrelated except in name and league affiliation to the current Winnipeg franchise).\n\nIn recent decades in U.S. college basketball, both men's and women's, most conferences have held tournaments to determine a winner who is awarded an automatic berth in the NCAA's postseason tournament. The Ivy League, however, was the last holdout in NCAA Division I—through the 2015–16 season, it continued to award its automatic NCAA tournament berth to the team with the best regular-season record in conference play. In case of a tie at the top of the standings, rules called for a one-game playoff, with the winner claiming the conference's automatic bid. If more than two teams were tied, a series of one-game playoffs was held. The Ivy League held its first postseason tournaments for both men and women at the end of the 2016–17 season, with the top four teams in the conference standings participating at a predetermined site.\n\nIn men's basketball, nine seasons ended in such a playoff, with the last being the 2014–15 season in which Harvard and Yale finished tied. The only time more than two teams finished tied atop the regular season standings was in the 2001–02 season, when Yale beat Princeton in the first one-game playoff, before losing to Penn. The last three-way playoff in women's basketball was in the 2007–08 season, in which Cornell, Dartmouth, and Harvard all finished at 11–3 in league play. It was determined that Dartmouth would play Harvard in the first playoff game, with the winner facing Cornell. Dartmouth won the first playoff game, with Cornell winning the playoff final.\n\nWhen the 2011 Premier Development League qualifiers in a region could not be settled by the four-stage qualifier of points, then wins, then goal difference, and goals scored, for the final position, the two teams, Kitsap Pumas and Portland Timbers U23's, agreed to discard the traditional lottery draw for the final slot and replace it with the result of their next scheduled game in the league also a one-game playoff to determine the final slot in the U. S. Open Cup. If the game ended in a tie, penalty kicks would be used to determine the U. S. Open Cup qualifier, but not for PDL standings.\n\nIn the Philippines, the one-game playoff is called a \"knockout game\". In all instances, all games are held in neutral venues, since the home-and-away system is not used.\n\nAs opposed to the usage in North American, in which one-game playoffs are held to determine a champion, in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), one-game playoffs are held when teams are tied in a last qualifying seed in the team standings. An extra game will be played in order to determine which team would be eliminated and which team will advance.\n\nWith the restructuring of the playoffs starting at the 2005–06 season, one game playoffs are also held which do not merit automatic elimination. When two teams are tied on the last qualifying seed for a stage (such as the #2 seed for the last semifinal berth), a classification game will be played in order to determine which team will clinch the higher seed. If the two teams are not tied on the last qualifying seed (such as the #1 seed where both teams are in the semifinals already), the points difference between the tied teams will be used to determine which team clinches the higher seed. Consequently, one-game playoffs that don't eliminate the loser are called \"knockdown games.\"\n\nPlayoffs such as those after the 2004 restructuring are common due to the low number of games played in the elimination round (14–18). In fact, each conference was able to feature at least one playoff game, until the 2007–08 PBA Philippine Cup where even though there were tied teams, the team's positions are not critical so they were resolved on the point differential among the tied teams' games.\n\nCuriously, no elimination playoff game has been held right after the elimination round; therefore all games mentioned were for seeding purposes and no teams were eliminated, although losing teams had a tougher road to qualify to the succeeding stages.\n\nStarting at the reformation of the playoff structure of the UAAP basketball tournament on 1993 (actually first used on 1994 since UST swept the playoffs and were named automatic champions on 1993), where the top 4 teams qualify for the semifinals, with the top 2 teams clinching the twice to beat advantage, a playoff will be held if two teams were tied for the fourth and last semifinal berth.\n\nLately, when three or more teams are tied, all three teams undergo a series of one-game playoffs to determine the top seed and which team is eliminated.\n\nMen's playoff results include:\n\nIn 2017, there were three teams tied for #4 in the NCAA, leading to two rounds of playoffs for #4. In 2015, three teams were tied for #3, and two rounds of playoffs were held: the first round for the #4 seed (loser is eliminated), and the second round for the #3 seed (loser is #4 seed).\n\nTies may also broken when two teams are tied for third, second and first seeds, although the competing teams still qualify for the playoffs when they lose; a playoff game for the #2 seed serves as a \"de facto\" game 1 of a best-of-three series. The UAAP had depreciated for playoffs for the #1 and #3 seeds.\n\nThe UAAP has also used this format for the volleyball tournaments.\n\nA one-game playoff is at least theoretically possible in association football league competitions, where two teams competing for a significant prize are tied in all tie-breaking criteria. Most association football leagues only consider points, then goal difference and then goals scored when determining final standing. A few leagues also consider such criteria as head-to-head records, but this is not the norm.\n\nFor example, the Premier League announced that there would be a one-game playoff for third place between Arsenal and Chelsea if the two teams had finished exactly level at the end of the 2012–13 season. This would have been necessary because third place conferred automatic qualification for the group stage of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League, whereas fourth place only led to a place in the final qualifying round of that competition. Before tiebreak rules such as goal difference were utilised, the Scottish league championships in 1891 and 1905 were determined by one game playoffs.\n\nUntil the 2004–05 season, the Italian Serie A had a one-game playoff called \"Spareggio\", to determine the league champion if teams were tied in points at the end of the season.\n\nAnother example of a one-game playoff in association football would be a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying football match between Algeria and Egypt.\n\n"}

Writing in Hiligaynon, he is a Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature Hall of Fame Awardee, the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Literary Grant, and the All-Western Visayas Literary Contest (National Commission for Culture and the Arts) winner. In 2015, he became the first Filipino author to be invited to the Sharjah International Book Fair in the United Arab Emirates. Writing in English, Filipino, and Hiligaynon, he has authored at least 20 books, and has written screenplays. He wrote and edited newspapers in Iloilo City before becoming a nurse in the United States.\n\nAs an actor, Nery briefly appeared in Tikoy Aguiluz's film on cybersex, \"www.XXX.com\", of which he was also the assistant director. He has also written, produced, and directed a full-length feature film in Hiligaynon, \"Gugma sa Panahon sang Bakunawa\" (Love in the Time of the Bakunawa), which was a finalist at the 1st Sineng Pambansa National Film Competition of the Film Development Council of the Philippines. Nery resides in Reisterstown, Maryland, and continues to write in at least three languages.\n\nPeter Solis Nery was born on January 6, 1969 and raised in the coastal town of Dumangas, Iloilo, Philippines. He is the eldest among five siblings and his parents were both public school teachers. Peter attended primary school at the Dumangas Central Elementary School, completed his secondary education at the Dumangas Polytechnic College (now Iloilo State College of Fisheries), where he was consistently a first honor student from grade school to high school. He finished his bachelor of science degree in Biology from the University of the Philippines in the Visayas, where he was named \"Most Outstanding Student\" (1989) and \"Most Outstanding Graduate of 1990\". He also received the \"President’s Award of Merit as Outstanding Student\" in his graduation year.\n\nWhile at school, Peter honed his talent for writing. Under his editorship, he led the UPV College of Arts and Sciences' official publication, \"Pagbutlak\" (Sunrise) to become the region’s best at the 1989 College Press Awards. Peter also had attended the SVD Christ the King Mission Seminary in Quezon City where he took an Associate in Philosophy degree in 1992-1993. In 2004, he earned his Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from the West Negros College (now West Negros University) in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental.\n\nAfter the EDSA Revolution of 1986, Peter found himself in a new wave of Philippine literature. There was a resurgence of interest in nationalistic writing. At U.P., Peter was lucky to meet Leoncio Deriada (2001 Palanca Hall of Fame awardee) who encouraged him to write in Hiligaynon. Peter won his first national award in writing for his poetry in Hiligaynon, \"Mga Ambahanon kag Pangamuyo sang Bata nga Nalimtan sa Wayang\" (Songs and Prayers of a Child Forgotten in the Fields)in 1992. For his performance poetry \"Si Eva, si Delilah, si Ruth, kag ang Alput\" (Eva, Delilah, Ruth, and the Prostitute) at the Premio Operiano Italia, he was named \"Hari sang Binalaybay\" (King of Hiligaynon Poetry) in 1993, a title he held until 1998. During his student activism days at the university, he wrote his first book, \"I Flew a Kite for Pepe\", in 1993. He admits, “I cringe now at my boldness to call it poetry then but I always thought that the book had a big heart. I still cry when I read it.” It was followed by his earth song and hymn to the planet, \"First Few Notes of a Green Symphony\".\n\nWhile working as a religious missionary in Macau, Peter became more introspective and started his memoirs. \"The Essential Thoughts of a Purple Cat\" was published by Giraffe Books in 1996; \"Moon River, Butterflies and Me\" in 1997; and \"My Life as a Hermit\" again by Giraffe in 1998. In 1995, he won the NCCA Western Visayas Poetry Competition for his collection \"Umanhon nga Gugma\" (Love of the Rural Folks). Some of the poems were translated, reworked, and included in his provocative collection, \"Rated R\" (Giraffe Books, 1997).\n\nPeter published four titles in 1997: the playful poetry collection \"Shy Evocations of Childhood and Other Poems that Came under Hypnosis\", and \"Rated R\" for Giraffe; \"Shorts\", a collection of haiku-like poems, and the memoir \"Moon River, Butterflies and Me\" for New Day.\n\nHe won his first Palanca gold medal for his magical realist Hiligaynon Short Story \"Lirio\" about a deaf-mute who is a victim of marital rape. Furthermore, his first screenplay, \"Buyong\", about a Katipunero revolutionary from Aklan won third prize in the screenplay category of the Centennial Literary Prize. Later that year, his second screenplay, \"Tayo na sa Buwan\" (Let’s Go to the Moon), won an honorable mention at the Film Development Foundation of the Philippines.\n\nEventually, he started his own publishing company and produced \"A Loneliness Greater than Love\" (2000), an exploration of homoerotic themes; and \"Fantasia\" (2000), a collection of his Palanca-winning fiction. In 2001, he published \"Rain as Gentle as Tears\", a sequel to his 1997 Shorts collection, and \"The Prince of Ngoyngoy\" (The Prince of Sob), a collection of lyric poems in Hiligaynon that established Peter as the Ilonggo epitome of emotional poetry.\n\nIn 2003, he launched \"Pierre: The Magazine of Peter Solis Nery\". It delivered three monthly issues.\n\nWhen opportunity came in 2006, he went to the United States to work as a nurse. For 100 days in 2005, Peter endeavored to write 100 erotic sonnets in Hiligaynon. He called it \"Kakunyag\" (Thrill). It was launched during the National Arts Month 2006 in Iloilo, and was serialized in a newspaper. He won a Palanca in 2006 for his Hiligaynon psycho-thriller short story, \"Ang Kapid\" (The Twins). The win provided him another encouragement to persevere in writing in the Hiligaynon. In 2007, Peter won his second Palanca gold for his historical Hiligaynon Short Story \"Candido\", about the \"anting-anting\" (amulet) of the revolutionary Candido Iban. The following year, he won his third Palanca gold for his play in English, \"The Passion of Jovita Fuentes\", about the tragic love of the first Filipino international opera diva and first female National Artist in Music. Peter also completed translation of his 100 Erotic Sonnets in the Hiligaynon into English in 2008.\n\nNery enrolled in Nursing as he continued to write for the newspaper. He graduated his Bachelor of Science in Nursing in October 2004. He went to the United States in February 2006 and became a Registered Nurse in California in May of the same year and started working as an orthopedic nurse in Los Angeles in 2007. In October 2008, he was given various awards for his commitment to his nursing profession including the Daisy Award for Extraordinary Nurses.\n\nThe Peter Solis Nery Foundation, or The Peter Solis Nery Foundation for Hiligaynon Literature and the Arts, Inc. was established in September 2012 by Nery, right after his induction into the Palanca Awards Hall of Fame. The foundation, which aims to promote, preserve, and propagate Hiligaynon literature, and Filipino art and culture, through research, publications, productions, education, and cultural dissemination, was incorporated by the \"Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission\" on November 5, 2012.\nFollowing immediately, the foundation created the Peter’s Prize for Excellence in Hiligaynon Writing that first gave out awards in September 2013.\nIn May 2014, the foundation sponsored a month-long online Hiligaynon poetry workshop called \"Poem-a-thon with Peter Solis Nery\".\nIn August 2014, the foundation published five anthology books of \"new Hiligaynon writings\" culled from the Peter’s Prize competitions and the Poem-a-thon workshop.\n\nNery is gay, and was married to an American man from 2008 until the latter's death when Nery was 46.\n\nNery is a Roman Catholic despite the church’s stand on homosexuality.\n\n\n\n"}

However, precomposed letters are required for proper display in most IPA fonts. They are available only for labial consonants and coronal consonants .\n\nThe Unicode characters (U+02E4) and (U+02C1) look graphically similar. The IPA Handbook lists U+02E4 (IPA Number 423) as the only unambiguous pharyngealization marker. The superimposed tilde (U+0334, IPA Number 428) denotes either velarization or pharyngealization, and the IPA Handbook does not mention U+02C1 at all.\n\nUbykh, an extinct Northwest Caucasian language spoken in Russia and Turkey, used pharyngealization in 14 pharyngealized consonants. Chilcotin has pharyngealized consonants that trigger pharyngealization of vowels. Many languages (such as Salishan, Sahaptian) in the Plateau culture area of North America also have pharyngealization processes that are triggered by pharyngeal or pharyngealized consonants, which affect vowels.\n\nThe Khoisan language Taa (or !Xóõ) has pharyngealized vowels that contrast phonemically with voiced, breathy and epiglottalized vowels. That feature is represented in the orthography by a tilde under the respective pharyngealized vowel. In Tuu languages, epiglottalized vowels are phonemic.\n\nFor many languages, pharyngealization is generally associated with more dental articulations of coronal consonants. Dark l tends to be dental or denti-alveolar, but clear l tends to be retracted to an alveolar position.\n\nArabic and Syriac use secondary uvularization, which is generally not distinguished from pharyngealization, for the \"emphatic\" coronal consonants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15466916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15466916", "title": "Piquette", "text": "Piquette\n\nPiquette is a French wine term which commonly refers to a vinous beverage produced by adding water to grape pomace but sometimes refers to a very simple wine or a wine substitute.\n\nIf water is added to the pomace remaining after grapes intended for wine production have been pressed, it is possible to produce a thin, somewhat wine-like beverage.\n\nThe Ancient Greeks and Romans used pomace in this way under the name \"lora\", and the product was used for slaves and common workers. After the wine grapes were pressed twice, the pomace was soaked in water for a day and pressed for a third time. The resulting liquid was mixed with more water to produce a thin, tepid \"wine\" that was not very appealing.\n\nThe production of piquette by poor farmers, or for consumption by farmhands and workers continued during the centuries, and is known to have been in practice as late as the mid-20th century. However, piquette seems to have been primarily associated with poor conditions, where real wine could not be afforded.\n\nThe European Union wine regulations define piquette as the product obtained by the fermentation of untreated grape pomace macerated in water, or by leaching fermented grape pomace with water. In cases where an EU member state allows the production of piquette, it may only be used for distillation or for consumption in the families of individual wine-growers. It may not be sold.\n\nDuring the Great French Wine Blight in the late 19th century, the production of wine fell so dramatically in France that several types of \"Ersatz wine\" were frequently produced in France under the designation piquette, and not just consumed locally, but also sold. Some of it was coloured and flavoured to appear as real wine, or was blended into actual wine to increase the amount available.\n\nA common way to produce such piquettes was to mix raisins with water. The raisins used were imported to France from Mediterranean countries, and were produced from grape varieties not directly suitable for wine production.\n\nThe term \"piquette\" has also been used as a nickname for French wine of low quality. Piquette came to be used in this fashion because it is derived from the word \"piquer\", which means to prick or prickle. These wines often had a slight fizz which would prickle the mouth.\n\nPiquette was produced in what was then Paris's outskirts, in Belleville and Montmartre, in an era when the simpler wines for Paris were sourced as close to the capital as possible in order to lower transportation costs.\n\nVery simple wines are still sometimes referred to as \"piquette\" in French.\n\n"}
{"id": "189561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189561", "title": "Postage stamp gum", "text": "Postage stamp gum\n\nIn philately, gum is the substance applied to the back of a stamp to enable it to adhere to a letter or other mailed item. The term is generic, and applies both to traditional types such as gum arabic and to synthetic modern formulations. Gum is a matter of high importance in philately.\n\nBefore postage stamps existed, people receiving letters would have to pay for them. The payment was based on how many papers were in the envelope and how far the letter had traveled. Rowland Hill came up with a solution of prepayment. This led to his invention of stamp gum in 1837. The world's first adhesive postage stamp was called the Penny Black. Many early stamps were not gummed, however, and some have been unable to be gummed due to shortage (for instance, the typewritten Uganda Cowry stamps of 1895). Extreme tropical climates were also a problem for Curaçao and Suriname. Some stamps, intended only for sale to stamp collectors, have been issued without gum, for instance the United States Farley's Follies souvenir sheets of 1933. On the first stamps of Great Britain the gum was called \"cement\" and was made from a mixture of potato starch, wheat starch and acacia gum.\n\nOriginally, gumming took place after printing and before perforation, usually because the paper had to be damp for printing to work well, but in modern times most stamp printing is done dry on pre-gummed paper. There have been a couple of historical instances where stamps were regummed after being perforated, but these were unusual situations.\n\nOn early issues, gum was applied by hand, using a brush or roller, but in 1880 De La Rue came up with a machine gumming process using a printing press, and gum is now always applied by machine. The gum is universally spread as uniformly as possible.\n\nThe greatest manufacturing problem of the gumming process is its tendency to make the stamps curl, due to the different reaction of paper and gum to varying moisture levels. In the most extreme cases, the stamp will spontaneously roll up into a small tube. Various schemes have been tried, but the problem persists to this day. On Swiss stamps of the 1930s, Courvoisier used a gum-breaking machine that pressed a pattern of small squares into the gum, resulting in so-called \"grilled gum\". Another scheme has been to slice the gum with knives after it has been applied. In some cases the gum solves the problem itself by becoming \"crackly\" when it dries.\n\nThe appearance of the gum varies with the type and method of application, and may range from nearly invisible to dark brown globs. Types of gum used on stamps include:\n\nSome stamps have had gum applied in a pattern resembling a watermark, presumably as an additional security device. German stamps from 1921 had a pattern of wavy lines while Czech stamps from 1923 had gum showing the initials of the Czech Republic, \"CSP\". These patterns have been called \"gum devices\" or \"gum watermarks\".\n\nDue to shortages of material, such as in the situation following World War II in Germany, stamps may be gummed in an economy fashion. This so-called \"economy gum\" (German: \"Spargummi\") is only applied in patches.\n\nIn recent years, the use of self-adhesive stamps, otherwise known as pressure-sensitive stamps, has become widespread. This relatively new form of stamps has a smooth waxed or polymer-coated release carrier backing to which the pressure-adhesive adhesive of the stamp does not adhere as strongly as on paper. Therefore, the stamps can be released easily from the backing and placed onto a postal envelope. The first use was by Sierra Leone in 1964, and the United States tried it later on a 1974 Christmas stamp; this was judged a failure and was not reintroduced until 1989 when it gradually became widespread. In the 1990s, the U.S. Post Office began transitioning from water-based stamps into the use of self-adhesive stamps. By 1995, only 20 percent of the thirty-five billion stamps the Post Office produced every year were self-adhesive, yet by 2013 almost all U. S. stamps issued had become self-adhesive.\n\nA 1965 British study of the transmission of bacteria and viruses on gummed paper found that \"Although pathogenic bacteria and viruses were not isolated from sample envelopes obtained from various sources, the gums used in manufacture were found to exert a protective effect against death from desiccation on the bacteria and viruses which had been introduced into them\" and it was possible to demonstrate bacterial multiplication in the gum used for the manufacture of postage stamps.\" The authors added the warning that \"postage stamps are often handled very carelessly when issued over the counter, and yet the purchaser will usually lick them without hesitation. The present work shows how readily bacteria can adhere to the surface of gummed paper which has been slightly moistened; and the finger is a suitable source both of moisture and of bacterial contamination.\"\n\nA 1996 episode of the popular sitcom \"Seinfeld\" featured a character (Susan Ross) who was poisoned after licking the flap of too many gummed envelopes. The episode has been linked anecdotally to an increase in worries about the health risks of licking gummed paper and it has been speculated that it may have contributed to the growing popularity of self-adhesive stamps, at least in the United States.\n\nStamp gum is an item of importance for collectors, although its presence is rarely of use in differentiating between common and rare stamps, and being on the back of the stamp it is not usually visible. Nevertheless, its condition is reflected in the valuation of unused stamps. Generally, the following conditions are distinguished:\nIn stamp catalogues, these conditions are abbreviated with the signs **, *, and (*), respectively.\n\nSome stamps have been issued without any gum at all, either due to a lack of materials, or (in particular in tropical countries) to avoid the risk of stamp sheets sticking together. Such stamps cannot be found other than in (*) condition. Traditionally, in particular before World War II, stamps were mounted in albums with stamp hinges no matter whether they were used or unused. Hence some experts claim that very few unused stamps from the 19th century have not been hinged at some point in their existence. This means that old unused stamps in supposedly mint condition often come under suspicion of having been regummed, and the detection of regummed stamps is an important part of philatelic expertisation. Regummed stamps cannot be valued any higher than unused stamps without gum.\n\nDedicated philatelists strive to maintain the integrity of the backing gum, because such stamps are considered more desirable than stamps without their backing gum. The removal of any paper residue that has collected on the gum without removing the gum itself.\n\nIn 1906, trouble had constantly arisen due to the gum on the under face of the stamps. There was an official notice that stated that stamps were going to be prepared with 'hard' gum, and were intended for use in the summer or humid season to prevent the premature sticking together of the stamps, or the sticking to the paraffin paper when in book form.\n\nStamps that have text, numbers, or symbols imprinted on the adhesive are of special interest. e.g. to thematic collectors if the imprint is related to the occasion of the stamp issue, such as on the 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration stamps of the United States.\n\nStamps printed on the gummed side by mistake are sought after by collectors with an interest in uncommon varieties.\n\nThe gum of older stamp issues often causes the unused stamps to roll. To avoid this, some postal authorities, e.g. in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, had the gum broken by rollers, leading to its serration. The orientation of this serration is used to distinguish between different production runs.\n\nCare must be taken during production that stamp gum, in particular if prepared from natural materials, does not contain an excess of acid. The latter can destroy the stamp paper over time. Notable cases are the Ostropa commemorative sheet issued in Germany in 1935, and the German Zeppelin airmail stamps of 1936.\n\nThe thick gum on some older stamps, namely on issues of Austria-Hungary, tends to break due to changes in air humidity and temperature. Such breaks can also affect the stamp paper and cause the stamps to disintegrate.\n\nIn such cases, stamp catalogs recommend to remove the gum to avoid further damage to the stamps.\n\n\n"}

Although detractors of the time tried to belittle the word \"normalcy\" as a neologism as well as a malapropism, saying that it was poorly coined by Harding (as opposed to the more accepted term \"normality\"), there was contemporaneous discussion and evidence that \"normalcy\" had been listed in dictionaries as far back as 1857. Harding's promise was to return the United States' prewar mentality, without the thought of war tainting the minds of the American people. To sum up his points, he stated:\n\"America's present need is not heroics, but healing; not nostrums, but normalcy; not revolution, but restoration; not agitation, but adjustment; not surgery, but serenity; not the dramatic, but the dispassionate; not experiment, but equipoise; not submergence in internationality, but sustainment in triumphant nationality.\"\n\nHarding's position attracted support and was important during the United States presidential election, 1920, which he won with 60.3% of the popular vote. \n\nDuring the campaign, Harding addressed the issue of the word's origin, claiming that \"normalcy\" but not \"normality\" appeared in his dictionary:\nI have noticed that word caused considerable news editors to change it to \"normality\".

{"id": "28397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28397", "title": "Scottish Gaelic", "text": "Scottish Gaelic\n\nScottish Gaelic ( ) or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to simply as Gaelic, is a Celtic language native to the Gaels of Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish. Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking, as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language placenames.\n\nIn the 2011 census of Scotland, 57,375 people (1.1% of the Scottish population aged over three years old) reported as able to speak Gaelic, 1,275 fewer than in 2001. The highest percentages of Gaelic speakers were in the Outer Hebrides. Only about half of speakers were fully fluent in the language. Nevertheless, there are revival efforts, and the number of speakers of the language under age 20 did not decrease between the 2001 and 2011 censuses. Outside Scotland, Canadian Gaelic is spoken mainly in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. \n\nScottish Gaelic is not an official language of either the European Union or the United Kingdom. However, it is classed as an indigenous language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which the British government has ratified, and the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 established a language development body, \"\".\n\nAside from \"Scottish Gaelic\", the language may also be referred to simply as \"Gaelic\", pronounced or in English. \"Gaelic\" may also refer to the Irish language.\n\nScottish Gaelic is distinct from Scots, the Middle English-derived language varieties which had come to be spoken in most of the Lowlands of Scotland by the early modern era. Prior to the 15th century, these dialects were known as \"Inglis\" (\"English\") by its own speakers, with Gaelic being called \"Scottis\" (\"Scottish\"). From the late 15th century, however, it became increasingly common for such speakers to refer to Scottish Gaelic as \"Erse\" (\"Irish\") and the Lowland vernacular as \"Scottis\". Today, Scottish Gaelic is recognised as a separate language from Irish, so the word \"Erse\" in reference to Scottish Gaelic is no longer used.\n\nGaelic was commonly believed to have been brought to Scotland, in the 4th–5th centuries CE, by settlers from Ireland who founded the Gaelic kingdom of on Scotland's west coast in present-day Argyll. However, this theory is no longer universally accepted. In his academic paper Were the Scots Irish?, archaeologist Dr Ewan Campbell says that there is no archaeological or placename evidence of a migration or takeover. This lack of archaeological evidence was previously noted by Professor Leslie Alcock. Archaeological evidence shows that Argyll was different from Ireland, before and after the supposed migration, but that it also formed part of the Irish Sea province with Ireland, being easily distinguished from the rest of Scotland. Gaelic in Scotland was mostly confined to until the eighth century, when it began expanding into Pictish areas north of the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. By 900, Pictish appears to have become extinct, completely replaced by Gaelic. An exception might be made for the Northern Isles, however, where Pictish was more likely supplanted by Norse rather than by Gaelic.\n\nIn 1018, after the conquest of the Lothians by the Kingdom of Scotland, Gaelic reached its social, cultural, political, and geographic zenith. Colloquial speech in Scotland had been developing independently of that in Ireland since the eighth century. For the first time, the entire region of modern-day Scotland was called ' in Latin, and Gaelic was the '. In southern Scotland, Gaelic was strong in Galloway, adjoining areas to the north and west, West Lothian, and parts of western Midlothian. It was spoken to a lesser degree in north Ayrshire, Renfrewshire, the Clyde Valley and eastern Dumfriesshire. In south-eastern Scotland, there is no evidence that Gaelic was ever widely spoken.\n\nMany historians mark the reign of King Malcom Canmore (Malcolm III) as the beginning of Gaelic's eclipse in Scotland. His wife Margaret spoke no Gaelic, gave her children Anglo-Saxon rather than Gaelic names, and brought many English bishops, priests, and monastics to Scotland. When Malcolm and Margaret died in 1093, the Gaelic aristocracy rejected their anglicised sons and instead backed Malcolm's brother Donald Bàn. Donald had spent 17 years in Gaelic Ireland and his power base was in the thoroughly Gaelic west of Scotland. He was the last Scottish monarch to be buried on Iona, the traditional burial place of the Gaelic Kings of and the Kingdom of Alba. However, during the reigns of Malcolm Canmore's sons, Edgar, Alexander I and David I (their successive reigns lasting 1097–1153), Anglo-Norman names and practices spread throughout Scotland south of the Forth–Clyde line and along the northeastern coastal plain as far north as Moray. Norman French completely displaced Gaelic at court. The establishment of royal burghs throughout the same area, particularly under David I, attracted large numbers of foreigners speaking Old English. This was the beginning of Gaelic's status as a predominantly rural language in Scotland.\n\nClan chiefs in the northern and western parts of Scotland continued to support Gaelic bards who remained a central feature of court life there. The semi-independent Lordship of the Isles in the Hebrides and western coastal mainland remained thoroughly Gaelic since the language's recovery there in the 12th century, providing a political foundation for cultural prestige down to the end of the 15th century.\n\nBy the mid-14th century what eventually came to be called Scots (at that time termed Inglis) emerged as the official language of government and law. Scotland's emergent nationalism in the era following the conclusion of the Wars of Scottish Independence was organized using Scots as well. For example, the nation's great patriotic literature including John Barbour's \"The Brus\" (1375) and Blind Harry's \"The Wallace\" (before 1488) was written in Scots, not Gaelic. By the end of the 15th century, English/Scots speakers referred to Gaelic instead as 'Yrisch' or 'Erse', i.e. Irish and their own language as 'Scottis'.\n\nScottish Gaelic has a rich oral (\"\") and written tradition, having been the language of the bardic culture of the Highland clans for many years. However, the language was suppressed by the Scottish and later British states, especially after the Battle of Culloden in 1746, during the Highland Clearances, and by the exclusion of Scottish Gaelic from the educational system. Even before then, charitable schools operated by the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) used instructional methods designed to suppress the language in favour of English and corporal punishment against students using Gaelic. This was counterbalanced by the activities of the Gaelic Schools Society, founded in 1811. Their primary purpose was to teach Gaels literacy in their own language, with emphasis on being able to read the Bible.\n\nThe first well-known translation of the Bible into Scottish Gaelic was made in 1767 when Dr James Stuart of Killin and Dugald Buchanan of Rannoch produced a translation of the New Testament. The translation of the entire Bible was completed in 1801. In the first quarter of the 19th century, the SSPCK and the British and Foreign Bible Society distributed 60,000 Gaelic Bibles and 80,000 New Testaments. Very few European languages have made the transition to a modern literary language without an early modern translation of the Bible; the lack of a well-known translation may have contributed to the decline of Scottish Gaelic.\n\nDialects of Lowland Gaelic have been defunct since the 18th century. Gaelic in the Eastern and Southern Scottish Highlands, although alive in the mid-twentieth century, is now largely defunct. Although modern Scottish Gaelic is dominated by the dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye, there remain some speakers of the Inner Hebridean dialects of Tiree and Islay, and even a few elderly native speakers from Highland areas including Wester Ross, northwest Sutherland, Lochaber, and Argyll. Dialects on both sides of the Straits of Moyle (the North Channel) linking Scottish Gaelic with Irish are now extinct, though native speakers were still to be found on the Mull of Kintyre, in Rathlin and in North East Ireland as late as the mid-20th century. Records of their speech show that Irish and Scottish Gaelic existed in a dialect chain with no clear language boundary. Some features of moribund dialects have been preserved in Nova Scotia, including the pronunciation of the broad or velarised l () as , as in the Lochaber dialect.\n\nThe Endangered Languages Project lists Gaelic's status as \"threatened\", with \"20,000 to 30,000 active users\". UNESCO classifies Gaelic as \"definitely endangered\".\n\nThe 1755–2001 figures are census data quoted by MacAulay. The 2011 Gaelic speakers figures come from table KS206SC of the 2011 Census. The 2011 total population figure comes from table KS101SC. Note that the numbers of Gaelic speakers relate to the numbers aged 3 and over, and the percentages are calculated using those and the number of the total population aged 3 and over.\n\nThe 2011 UK Census showed a total of 57,375 Gaelic speakers in Scotland (1.1% of population over three years old), of whom only 32,400 could also read and write, due to the lack of Gaelic medium education in Scotland. Compared to the 2001 Census, there has been a diminution of approximately 1,300 people. This is the smallest drop between censuses since the Gaelic language question was first asked in 1881. The Scottish Government's language minister and \"Bord na Gaidhlig\" took this as evidence that Gaelic's long decline has slowed.\n\nThe main stronghold of the language continues to be the Outer Hebrides (\"\"), where the overall proportion of speakers is 52.2%. Important pockets of the language also exist in the Highlands (5.4%) and in Argyll and Bute (4.0%), and Inverness, where 4.9% speak the language. The locality with the largest absolute number is Glasgow with 5,878 such persons, who make up over 10% of all of Scotland's Gaelic speakers.\n\nGaelic continues to decline in its traditional heartland. Between 2001 and 2011, the absolute number of Gaelic speakers fell sharply in the Western Isles (−1,745), Argyll & Bute (−694), and Highland (−634). The drop in Stornoway, the largest parish in the Western Isles by population, was especially acute, from 57.5% of the population in 1991 to 43.4% in 2011. The only parish outside the Western Isles over 40% Gaelic-speaking is Kilmuir in Northern Skye at 46%. The islands in the Inner Hebrides with significant percentages of Gaelic speakers are Tiree (38.3%), Raasay (30.4%), Skye (29.4%), Lismore (26.9%), Colonsay (20.2%), and Islay (19.0%).\n\nAs a result of continued decline in the traditional Gaelic heartlands, today no civil parish in Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 65% (the highest value is in Barvas, Lewis, with 64.1%). In addition, no civil parish on mainland Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 20% (the highest value is in Ardnamurchan, Highland, with 19.3%). Out of a total of 871 civil parishes in Scotland, the proportion of Gaelic speakers exceeds 50% in 7 parishes, exceeds 25% in 14 parishes, and exceeds 10% in 35 parishes. Decline in traditional areas has recently been balanced by growth in the Scottish Lowlands. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, the number of Gaelic speakers rose in nineteen of the country's 32 council areas. The largest absolute gains were in Aberdeenshire (+526), North Lanarkshire (+305), Aberdeen City (+216), and East Ayrshire (+208). The largest relative gains were in Aberdeenshire (+0.19%), East Ayrshire (+0.18%), Moray (+0.16%), and Orkney (+0.13%).\n\nAs with other Celtic languages, monolingualism is non-existent except among native-speaking children under school age in traditional areas. In 2014, the census of pupils in Scotland showed 497 pupils in publicly funded schools had Gaelic as the main language at home, a drop of 18% from 606 students in 2010. During the same period, Gaelic medium education in Scotland has grown, with 3,583 pupils being educated in a Gaelic-immersion environment in 2014, up from 2,638 pupils in 2009. However, even among pupils enrolled in Gaelic medium schools, 81% of primary students and 74% of secondary students report using English more often than Gaelic when speaking with their mothers at home.\n\nGaelic has long suffered from its lack of use in educational and administrative contexts and was long suppressed.\n\nThe UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of Gaelic. Along with Irish and Welsh, Gaelic is designated under Part III of the Charter, which requires the UK Government to take a range of concrete measures in the fields of education, justice, public administration, broadcasting and culture. It has not received the same degree of official recognition from the UK Government as Welsh. With the advent of devolution, however, Scottish matters have begun to receive greater attention, and it achieved a degree of official recognition when the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament on 21 April 2005.\n\nThe key provisions of the Act are:\n\nFollowing a consultation period, in which the government received many submissions, the majority of which asked that the bill be strengthened, a revised bill was published; the main alteration was that the guidance of the is now statutory (rather than advisory). In the committee stages in the Scottish Parliament, there was much debate over whether Gaelic should be given 'equal validity' with English. Due to executive concerns about resourcing implications if this wording was used, the Education Committee settled on the concept of 'equal respect'. It is not clear what the legal force of this wording is.\n\nThe Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament unanimously, with support from all sectors of the Scottish political spectrum, on 21 April 2005. Under the provisions of the Act, it will ultimately fall to BnG to secure the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland.\n\nSome commentators, such as (2006) argue that the Gaelic Act falls so far short of the status accorded to Welsh that one would be foolish or naïve to believe that any substantial change will occur in the fortunes of the language as a result of 's efforts.\n\nOn 10 December 2008, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Scottish Human Rights Commission had the UDHR translated into Gaelic for the first time.\n\nHowever, given there are no longer any monolingual Gaelic speakers, following an appeal in the court case of \"Taylor v Haughney\" (1982), involving the status of Gaelic in judicial proceedings, the High Court ruled against a general right to use Gaelic in court proceedings.\n\nThe Scottish Qualifications Authority offer two streams of Gaelic examination across all levels of the syllabus: Gaelic for learners (equivalent to the modern foreign languages syllabus) and Gaelic for native speakers (equivalent to the English syllabus).\n\nIn October 2009, a new agreement was made which allows Scottish Gaelic to be used formally between Scottish Government ministers and European Union officials. The deal was signed by Britain's representative to the EU, Sir Kim Darroch, and the Scottish government. This does not give Scottish Gaelic official status in the EU, but gives it the right to be a means of formal communications in the EU's institutions. The Scottish government will have to pay for the translation from Gaelic to other European languages. The deal was received positively in Scotland; Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy said the move was a strong sign of the UK government's support for Gaelic. He said that \"Allowing Gaelic speakers to communicate with European institutions in their mother tongue is a progressive step forward and one which should be welcomed\". Culture Minister Mike Russell said that \"this is a significant step forward for the recognition of Gaelic both at home and abroad and I look forward to addressing the council in Gaelic very soon. Seeing Gaelic spoken in such a forum raises the profile of the language as we drive forward our commitment to creating a new generation of Gaelic speakers in Scotland.\"\n\nThe Scottish Gaelic used in Machine-readable British passports differs from Irish passports in places. \"Passport\" is rendered ' (in Irish, '); \"The European Union\", ' (in Irish, '), while \"Northern Ireland\" is ' in Gaelic (the Irish equivalent is ').\n\nBilingual road signs, street names, business and advertisement signage (in both Gaelic and English) are gradually being introduced throughout Gaelic-speaking regions in the Highlands and Islands, including Argyll. In many cases, this has simply meant re-adopting the traditional spelling of a name (such as ' or ' rather than the anglicised forms \"Ratagan\" or \"Lochailort\" respectively).\n\nBilingual railway station signs are now more frequent than they used to be. Practically all the stations in the Highland area use both English and Gaelic, and the spread of bilingual station signs is becoming ever more frequent in the Lowlands of Scotland, including areas where Gaelic has not been spoken for a long time.\n\nThis has been welcomed by many supporters of the language as a means of raising its profile as well as securing its future as a 'living language' (i.e. allowing people to use it to navigate from A to B in place of English) and creating a sense of place. However, in some places, such as Caithness, the Highland Council's intention to introduce bilingual signage has incited controversy.\n\nThe Ordnance Survey has acted in recent years to correct many of the mistakes that appear on maps. They announced in 2004 that they intended to correct them and set up a committee to determine the correct forms of Gaelic place names for their maps. Ainmean-Àite na h-Alba (\"Place names in Scotland\") is the national advisory partnership for Gaelic place names in Scotland.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, Canadian Gaelic was the third-most widely spoken language in Canada and Gaelic-speaking immigrant communities could be found throughout the country. Gaelic poets in Canada produced a significant literary tradition. The number of Gaelic-speaking individuals and communities declined sharply, however, after the First World War.\n\nNova Scotia is home to 1,275 Gaelic speakers as of 2011, of whom 300 claim to have Gaelic as their \"mother tongue.\" The Nova Scotia government maintains an Office of Gaelic Affairs which works to promote the Gaelic language, culture, and tourism. As in Scotland, areas of North-Eastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton have bilingual street signs. Nova Scotia also has \" (The Gaelic Council of Nova Scotia), a non-profit society dedicated to the maintenance and promotion of the Gaelic language and culture in Maritime Canada.\n\nMaxville Public School in Maxville, Glengarry, Ontario, Canada offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly. In Prince Edward Island, the Colonel Gray High School now offers both an introductory and an advanced course in Gaelic; both language and history are taught in these classes. This is the first recorded time that Gaelic has ever been taught as an official course on Prince Edward Island.\n\nThe province of British Columbia is host to the \" (The Gaelic Society of Vancouver), the Vancouver Gaelic Choir, the Victoria Gaelic Choir, as well as the annual Gaelic festival \" Vancouver\". The city of Vancouver's Scottish Cultural Centre also holds seasonal Scottish Gaelic evening classes.\n\nThe BBC operates a Gaelic-language radio station \"\" as well as a television channel, . Launched on 19 September 2008, BBC Alba is widely available in the UK (on Freeview, Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media). It also broadcasts across Europe on the Astra 2 satellites. The channel is being operated in partnership between BBC Scotland and – an organisation funded by the Scottish Government, which works to promote the Gaelic language in broadcasting. The ITV franchise in central Scotland, STV Central, produces a number of Scottish Gaelic programmes for both BBC Alba and its own main channel.\n\nUntil BBC Alba was broadcast on Freeview, viewers were able to receive the channel , which broadcast for an hour every evening. Upon BBC Alba's launch on Freeview, it took the channel number that was previously assigned to TeleG.\n\nThere are also television programmes in the language on other BBC channels and on the independent commercial channels, usually subtitled in English. The ITV franchise in the north of Scotland, STV North (formerly \"Grampian Television\") produces some non-news programming in Scottish Gaelic.\n\nThe Education (Scotland) Act 1872, which completely ignored Gaelic, and led to generations of Gaels being forbidden to speak their native language in the classroom, is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living can recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school. Even later, when these attitudes had changed, little provision was made for Gaelic medium education in Scottish schools. As late as 1958, even in Highland schools, only 20% of primary students were taught Gaelic as a subject, and only 5% were taught other subjects through the Gaelic language.\n\nGaelic-medium playgroups for young children began to appear in Scotland during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Parent enthusiasm may have been a factor in the \"establishment of the first Gaelic medium primary school units in Glasgow and Inverness in 1985\".\n\nThe first modern solely Gaelic-medium secondary school, (\"Glasgow Gaelic School\"), was opened at Woodside in Glasgow in 2006 (61 partially Gaelic-medium primary schools and approximately a dozen Gaelic-medium secondary schools also exist). According to , a total of 2,092 primary pupils were enrolled in Gaelic-medium primary education in 2008–09, as opposed to 24 in 1985.\n\nThe Columba Initiative, also known as \" (formerly ), is a body that seeks to promote links between speakers of Scottish Gaelic and Irish.\n\nIn May 2004, the Nova Scotia government announced the funding of an initiative to support the language and its culture within the province. Several public schools in Northeastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton offer Gaelic classes as part of the high-school curriculum. The government's Gaelic Affairs offers lunch-time lessons to public servants in Halifax.\n\nMaxville Public School in Maxville, Glengarry, Ontario, Canada offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly, and Prince Edward Island, Canada, the Colonel Gray High School offer an introductory and an advanced course in Scottish Gaelic.\n\nA number of Scottish and some Irish universities offer full-time degrees including a Gaelic language element, usually graduating as Celtic Studies.\n\nSt. Francis Xavier University, the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts and Cape Breton University (formerly University College Of Cape Breton) in Nova Scotia, Canada also offer a Celtic Studies degrees and/or Gaelic language programs.\n\nIn Russia the Moscow State University offers Gaelic language, history and culture courses.\n\nThe University of the Highlands and Islands offers a range of Gaelic language, history and culture courses at NC, HND, BA (ordinary), BA (Hons) and Msc, and offers opportunities for postgraduate research through the medium of Gaelic. Residential courses at on the Isle of Skye offer adults the chance to become fluent in Gaelic in one year. Many continue to complete degrees, or to follow up as distance learners. A number of other colleges offer a one-year certificate course, which is also available online (pending accreditation).\n\nLews Castle College's Benbecula campus offers an independent 1-year course in Gaelic and Traditional Music (FE, SQF level 5/6).\n\nIn the Western Isles, the isles of Lewis, Harris and North Uist have a Presbyterian majority (largely Church of Scotland – ' in Gaelic, Free Church of Scotland and Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland.) The isles of South Uist and Barra have a Catholic majority. All these churches have Gaelic-speaking congregations throughout the Western Isles. Notable city congregations with regular services in Gaelic are St Columba's Church, Glasgow and Greyfriars Tolbooth & Highland Kirk, Edinburgh. ' – a shorter Gaelic version of the English-language Book of Common Order – was published in 1996 by the Church of Scotland.\n\nThe widespread use of English in worship has often been suggested as one of the historic reasons for the decline of Gaelic. The Church of Scotland is supportive today, but has a shortage of Gaelic-speaking ministers. The Free Church also recently announced plans to abolish Gaelic-language communion services, citing both a lack of ministers and a desire to have their congregations united at communion time.\n\nFrom the sixth century to the present day, Scottish Gaelic has been used as the language of literature. Two prominent writers of the twentieth century are Anne Frater and Sorley Maclean.\n\nGaelic has its own version of European-wide names which also have English forms, for example: ' (John), ' (Alexander), ' (William), ' (Catherine), ' (Robert), ' (Christina), ' (Ann), ' (Mary), ' (James), ' (Patrick) and \" (Thomas).\nNot all traditional Gaelic names have direct equivalents in English: ', which is normally rendered as \"Euphemia\" (Effie) or \"Henrietta\" (Etta) (formerly also as Henny or even as Harriet), or, ', which is \"matched\" with \"Dorothy\", simply on the basis of a certain similarity in spelling. Many of these traditional Gaelic-only names are now regarded as old-fashioned, and hence are rarely or never used.\n\nSome names have come into Gaelic from Old Norse; for example, ' ( < '), ' (< '), ' or ' (< '), ' (< '), ' (\"\"). These are conventionally rendered in English as \"Sorley\" (or, historically, \"Somerled\"), \"Norman\", \"Ronald\" or \"Ranald\", \"Torquil\" and \"Iver\" (or \"Evander\").\n\nSome Scottish names are Anglicized forms of Gaelic names: ' → (Angus), '→ (Donald), for instance. ', and the recently established ' (pronounced ) come from the Gaelic for, respectively, James, and Mary, but derive from the form of the names as they appear in the vocative case: ' (James) (nom.) → ' (voc.), and, ' (Mary) (nom.) → ' (voc.).\n\nThe most common class of Gaelic surnames are those beginning with ' (Gaelic for \"son\"), such as \"/\" (MacLean). The female form is ' (Gaelic for \"daughter\"), so Catherine MacPhee is properly called in Gaelic, ' (strictly, \"nic\" is a contraction of the Gaelic phrase ', meaning \"daughter of the son\", thus ' really means \"daughter of MacDonald\" rather than \"daughter of Donald\"). The \"of\" part actually comes from the genitive form of the patronymic that follows the prefix; in the case of ', ' (\"of Donald\") is the genitive form of ' (\"Donald\").\n\nSeveral colours give rise to common Scottish surnames: ' (Bain – white), ' (Roy – red), ' (Dow, Duff – black), ' (Dunn – brown), \"\" (Bowie – yellow).\n\nMost varieties of Gaelic have either 8 or 9 vowel phonemes (), which can be either long or short. There are also two reduced vowels () which only occur short. Although some vowels are strongly nasal, instances of distinctive nasality are rare. There are about nine diphthongs and a few triphthongs.\n\nMost consonants have both palatal and non-palatal counterparts, including a very rich system of liquids, nasals and trills (i.e. 3 contrasting l sounds, 3 contrasting n sounds and 3 contrasting r sounds). The historically voiced stops have lost their voicing, so the phonemic contrast today is between unaspirated and aspirated . In many dialects, these stops may however gain voicing through secondary articulation through a preceding nasal, for examples ' \"door\" but ' \"the door\" as or .\n\nIn some fixed phrases, these changes are shown permanently, as the link with the base words has been lost, as in ' \"now\", from ' \"this time/period\".\n\nIn medial and final position, the aspirated stops are preaspirated rather than aspirated.\n\nScottish Gaelic is an Indo-European language with an inflecting morphology, verb–subject–object word order and two grammatical genders.\n\nGaelic nouns inflect for four cases (nominative/accusative, vocative, genitive and dative) and three numbers (singular, dual and plural).\n\nThey are also normally classed as either masculine or feminine. A small number of words that used to belong to the neuter class show some degree of gender confusion. For example, in some dialects ' \"the sea\" behaves as a masculine noun in the nominative case, but as a feminine noun in the genitive (').\n\nNouns are marked for case in a number of ways, most commonly involving various combinations of lenition, palatalisation and suffixation.\n\nThere are 12 irregular verbs. Most other verbs follow a fully predictable paradigm, although polysyllabic verbs ending in laterals can deviate from this paradigm as they show syncopation.\n\nThere are:\n\nWord order is strictly verb–subject–object, including questions, negative questions and negatives. Only a restricted set of preverb particles may occur before the verb.\n\nThe majority of the vocabulary of Scottish Gaelic is native Celtic. There are a large number of borrowings from Latin, (', ' from '), Norse (' from ', ' from '), French (' from ') and Scots (', \").\n\nThere are also many Brythonic influences on Scottish Gaelic. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but it is not always possible to disentangle P and Q Celtic words. However some common words such as = Welsh , Cumbric are clearly of P-Celtic origin.\n\nIn common with other Indo-European languages, the neologisms which are coined for modern concepts are typically based on Greek or Latin, although often coming through English; \"television\", for instance, becomes ' and \"computer\" becomes '. Some speakers use an English word even if there is a Gaelic equivalent, applying the rules of Gaelic grammar. With verbs, for instance, they will simply add the verbal suffix (', or, in Lewis, ', as in, \"\" \"watch' (Lewis, \"watch'\") ' telly\" (I am watching the television), instead of \"'\". This phenomenon was described over 170 years ago, by the minister who compiled the account covering the parish of Stornoway in the \"New Statistical Account of Scotland\", and examples can be found dating to the eighteenth century. However, as Gaelic medium education grows in popularity, a newer generation of literate Gaels is becoming more familiar with modern Gaelic vocabulary.\n\nScottish Gaelic has also influenced the Scots language and English, particularly Scottish Standard English. Loanwords include: whisky, slogan, brogue, jilt, clan, trousers, gob, as well as familiar elements of Scottish geography like ben ('), glen (') and . Irish has also influenced Lowland Scots and English in Scotland, but it is not always easy to distinguish its influence from that of Scottish Gaelic.\n\nThe modern Scottish Gaelic alphabet has 18 letters:\n\nThe letter \"\", now mostly used to indicate lenition (historically sometimes inaccurately called \"aspiration\") of a consonant, was in general not used in the oldest orthography, as lenition was instead indicated with a dot over the lenited consonant. The letters of the alphabet were traditionally named after trees, but this custom has fallen out of use.\n\nLong vowels are marked with a grave accent ('), indicated through digraphs (e.g. ' is ) or conditioned by certain consonant environments (e.g. a ' preceding a non-intervocalic ' is ). Traditional spelling systems also use the acute accent on the letters ', ' and \"\" to denote a change in vowel quality rather than length, but the reformed spellings have replaced these with the grave.\n\nCertain 18th century sources used only an acute accent along the lines of Irish, such as in the writings of Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (1741–51) and the earliest editions (1768–90) of Duncan Ban MacIntyre.\n\nThe 1767 New Testament set the standard for Scottish Gaelic. The 1981 Scottish Examination Board recommendations for Scottish Gaelic, the Gaelic Orthographic Conventions, were adopted by most publishers and agencies, although they remain controversial among some academics, most notably Ronald Black.\n\nThe quality of consonants (palatalised or non-palatalised) is indicated in writing by the vowels surrounding them. So-called \"slender\" consonants are palatalised while \"broad\" consonants are neutral or velarised. The vowels ' and ' are classified as slender, and ', ', and ' as broad. The spelling rule known as ' (\"slender to slender and broad to broad\") requires that a word-medial consonant or consonant group followed by a written ' or ' be also preceded by an ' or '; and similarly if followed by ', ' or ' be also preceded by an ', ', or '.\n\nThis rule sometimes leads to the insertion of an orthographic vowel that does not influence the pronunciation of the vowel. For example, plurals in Gaelic are often formed with the suffix ' , for example, ' (shoe) / ' (shoes). But because of the spelling rule, the suffix is spelled ' (but pronounced the same, ) after a slender consonant, as in ' ((a) people) / ' (peoples) where the written ' is purely a graphic vowel inserted to conform with the spelling rule because an ' precedes the \"\".\n\nUnstressed vowels omitted in speech can be omitted in informal writing. For example:\n\nGaelic orthographic rules are mostly regular; however, English sound-to-letter correspondences cannot be applied to written Gaelic.\n\nScots English orthographic rules have also been used at various times in Gaelic writing. Notable examples of Gaelic verse composed in this manner are the Book of the Dean of Lismore and the manuscript.\n\nNote: Items in brackets denote archaic or dialectal forms\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Tando Jam town, Hyderabad District to school-teacher and poet \"Mohammad Yaqub Niaz\" on October 24, 1933, in a house of ten siblings.\n\nAfter completion of his early education, his family shifted from his native town to Hyderabad where he completed his matriculation in 1950, after which he moved to Karachi. Studying at DJ National College, he also started working as a part-time sub-editor at the weekly Sindh Observer to meet the expenses of education and boarding at the Jinnah Courts. Later he shifted back to Hyderabad, where he worked with Mohammad Usman Diplai at his printing press and later as an assistant in the Sindhi Adabi Board, where he along with Mohammad Ibrahim Joyo and Ghulam Rabbani Agro translated classical works from English to Sindhi.\n\nIn 1957 he passed civil services examination and was appointed in the income tax department. During his government job he continued to write and meet politicians at will, which angered the government. In 1969 after Yahya Khan’s takeover as chief martial law administrator, he became one of the 303 officials summarily dismissed from service. After his forced retirement, he picked up the profession of legal consultancy and worked as an income tax lawyer.\n\nHe knew Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Bhutto personally before he joined the government. He recalled the first meeting with him in 1957 when Bhutto had written a book titled ‘Pakistan: a military state or a federal state’. He translated the book. When Bhutto formed the Pakistan People’s Party, he bought Hilal-i-Pakistan, a Sindhi daily, but shifted its place of publication from Hyderabad to Karachi. In a retired Siraj, he found an editor who could frame its policy and run the newspaper on healthy grounds. As its editor, Siraj laid some very bold lines for a newspaper by objective reporting and healthy criticism. He also set the gossip column in Sindhi journalism on modern lines. As a newspaper editor, Memon introduced new trends into Sindhi-language journalism and his time there was widely regarded the golden period of the paper as well as the start of modern Sindhi journalism.\n\nHe worked for the newspaper for six years until his resignation in 1977 when military-dictator General Zia ul-Haq imposed martial law in Pakistan.\n\nA keen student of history, he made an unprecedented attempt to write a novel on the political developments and social conditions of Sindh in the post-Samma period. His first novel, \"Parrado Soyie Sadd\", depicts the tyrannical rule of Tarkhans and Arghuns on Sindh. ‘\"Parado soyee sadd\"’ earned him laurels from literary critics. He also wrote a book on the origin and evolution of the Sindhi language, \"Sindhi Boli\" (1964). His other works are: \"Dakhan maan tho sij ubhre\" (tr 1953), \"Sindh ji iqtasadi tarikh\" (tr 1958), \"Choond Amerki afsana\" (tr in association of Agro 1958), \"Ai dard hali aoo\" (short stories 1962), \"Muhinji duniya haikal viyakul\" (1988), \"Tuhinji duniya sabh rang sanwal\" (1989), \"Muhinji duniya mirgh trishna\" (1990).\n\nSiraj Memon wrote a total of five novels, but three of his novels – \"Parrado Soyoi Sadd\" (The Echo and the Call are the Same), \"Maran Moun Se Aa\" (Come die with me) and \"Tunhji Dunya Sabh Rang Sanwal\" (Your Life has all the Colours) – are considered to be some of the most widely acclaimed novels in Sindhi literature.\n\nHe also translated T. S. Eliot in Urdu. \nHe authored a book on the Memon community of the Subcontinent, which he himself belonged to.\nHe was also the chief editor of the Oxford Sindhi dictionary, which was compiled in 2010.\n\nIn 2011 Sirajul Haq Memon was awarded the \"Sitara-i-Imtiaz\" for his meritorious services to Sindhi language and society.\n\nIn the last days he was rewriting his earlier book on the origin and evolution of Sindhi and trying to accommodate new findings during the past three decades.\n\nSiraj died in Karachi in the early hours of Saturday, February 2, 2013 at the age of 79.

{"id": "372988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=372988", "title": "Tamil literature", "text": "Tamil literature\n\nTamil literature () refers to the literature in the Tamil language. Tamil literature has a rich and long literary tradition spanning more than two thousand years. The oldest extant works show signs of maturity indicating an even longer period of evolution. Contributors to the Tamil literature are mainly from Tamil people from South India, including the land now comprising Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Sri Lankan Tamils from Sri Lanka, and from Tamil diaspora. The history of Tamil literature follows the history of Tamil Nadu, closely following the social, political and cultural trends of various periods. The early Sangam literature, starting from the period of 2nd century BCE (Akananuru (1, 15, 31, 55, 61, 65, 91, 97, 101, 115, 127, 187, 197, 201, 211, 233, 251, 265, 281, 311, 325, 331, 347, 349, 359, 393, 281, 295), Kurunthogai (11), Natrinai (14, 75) are dated before 300 BCE), contain anthologies of various poets dealing with many aspects of life, including love, war, social values and religion. This was followed by the early epics and moral literature, authored by Hindu, Jain and Buddhist authors, lasting up to the 5th century CE. From the 6th to 12th century CE, the Tamil devotional poems written by Nayanmars (sages of Shaivism) and Alvars (sages of Vaishnavism), heralded the great Bhakti movement which later engulfed the entire Indian subcontinent. It is during this era that some of the grandest of Tamil literary classics like Kambaramayanam and Periya Puranam were authored and many poets were patronized by the imperial Chola and Pandya empires. The later medieval period saw many assorted minor literary works and also contributions by a few Muslim and European authors.\n\nA revival of Tamil literature took place from the late 19th century when works of religious and philosophical nature were written in a style that made it easier for the common people to enjoy. The modern Tamil literary movement started with Subramania Bharathi, the multifaceted Indian Nationalist poet and author, and was quickly followed up by many who began to utilize the power of literature in influencing the masses. With growth of literacy, Tamil prose began to blossom and mature. Short stories and novels began to appear. Modern Tamil literary criticism also evolved. The popularity of Tamil cinema has also interacted with Tamil literature in some mutually enriching ways.\n\nSangam literature comprises some of the oldest extant Tamil literature, and deals with love, traditions, war, governance, trade and bereavement. Unfortunately much of the Tamil literature belonging to the Sangam period has been lost. The literature currently available from this period is perhaps just a fraction of the wealth of material produced during this golden age of Tamil civilization. The available literature from this period has been broadly divided in antiquity into three categories based roughly on chronology. These are: the Eighteen Greater Text Series (\"Pathinenmaelkanakku\") comprising the Eight Anthologies (\"Ettuthokai\") and the Ten Idylls (\"Pattupattu\") and the Five Great Epics. \"Tolkaappiyam\", a commentary on grammar, phonetics, rhetoric and poetics is dated from this period.\n\nTamil legends hold that these were composed in three successive poetic assemblies (\"Sangam\") that were held in ancient times on a now vanished continent far to the south of India. A significant amount of literature could have preceded \"Tolkappiyam\" as grammar books are usually written after the existence of literature over long periods. Tamil tradition holds the earliest \"Sangam\" poetry to be over twelve millennia old. Modern linguistic scholarship places the poems between the 1st century BC and the 3rd century AD.\n\nSangam age is considered by the Tamil people as the golden era of Tamil language. This was the period when the Tamil country was ruled by the three 'crowned kings' the Cheras, Pandyas and the Cholas. The land was at peace with no major external threats. Asoka's conquests did not impact on the Tamil land and the people were able to indulge in literary pursuits. The poets had a much more casual relationship with their rulers than can be imagined in later times. They could chide them when they are perceived to wander from the straight and narrow. The greatness of the Sangam age poetry may be ascribed not so much to its antiquity, but due to the fact that their ancestors were indulging in literary pursuits and logical classification of the habitats and society in a systematic manner with little to draw from precedents domestically or elsewhere. The fact that these classifications were documented at a very early date in the grammatical treatise \"Tolkappiyam\", demonstrates the organized manner in which the Tamil language has evolved. \"Tolkappiyam\" is not merely a textbook on Tamil grammar giving the inflection and syntax of words and sentences but also includes classification of habitats, animals, plants and human beings. The discussion on human emotions and interactions is particularly significant. Tolkappiyam divided into three chapters: orthography, etymology and subject matter (\"Porul\"). While the first two chapters of Tolkappiyam help codify the language, the last part, \"Porul\" refers to the people and their behavior. The grammar helps to convey the literary message on human behavior and conduct, and uniquely merges the language with its people.\n\nThe literature was classified into the broad categories of 'subjective' (\"akam\") and 'objective' (\"puram\") topics to enable the poetic minds to discuss any topic under the sun, from grammar to love, within the framework of well prescribed, socially accepted conventions. Subjective topics refer to the personal or human aspect of emotions that cannot be verbalized adequately or explained fully. It can only be experienced by the individuals and includes love and sexual relationship.\n\nRecognizing that human activities cannot take place in vacuum and are constantly influenced by environmental factors, human experiences, in general, and subjective topics in particular, are assigned to specific habitats. Accordingly, land was classified into five genres (\"thinai\"): \"kurinji\" (mountainous regions), \"mullai\" (forests), \"marutham\" (agricultural lands), \"neithal\" (seashore), \"paalai\" (wasteland). The images associated with these landscapes – birds, beasts, flowers, gods, music, people, weather, seasons – were used to subtly convey a mood, associated with an aspect of life. \"Kuruntokai\", a collection of poems belonging to the \"Ettuthokai\" anthology demonstrates an early treatment of the Sangam landscape. Such treatments are found to be much refined in the later works of \"Akananuru\" and \"Paripaatal\". \"Paripaatal\" takes its name from the musical \"Paripaatal meter\" utilised in these poems. This is the first instance of a work set to music. \"Akaval\" and \"kalippa\" were the other popular meters used by poets during the Sangam age.\n\nThe three centuries after the Sangam age . The invaders replaced number of words and concepts relating to ethics, philosophy and religion of Tamil. As a result, Tamil has around 30% of Sanskrit in today's use. However, today, the Indo-Aryan Migration theory has been debunked as baseless and without concrete evidence. Around 300 CE, the Tamil land was under the influence of a group of people known as the Kalabhras. The Kalabhras were Buddhist and a number of Buddhist authors flourished during this period. Jainism and Buddhism saw rapid growth. These authors, perhaps reflecting the austere nature of their faiths, created works mainly on morality and ethics. A number of Jain and Buddhist poets contributed to the creation of these didactic works as well as grammar and lexicography. The collection the Eighteen Lesser Text series (\"Pathinenkilkanakku\") was of this period.\n\nThe best known of these works on ethics is the \"Tirukkural\" by Thiruvalluvar. The book is a comprehensive manual of ethics, polity and love, containing 1,330 distichs or \"kural\" divided into chapters of ten distichs each: the first thirty-eight on ethics, the next seventy on polity and the remainder on love.\n\nOther famous works of this period are \"Kaḷavaḻi Nāṟpatu\", \"Nalatiyar\", \"Inna Narpathu\" and \"Iniyavai Narpathu\". The Jain texts \"Nalatiyar\" and \"Pazhamozhi Nanuru\" each consist of four hundred poems, each of which cites a proverb and then illustrates it with a story.\n\nThe fall of the Kalabhras around 500 CE saw a reaction from the thus far suppressed Hindus. The Kalabhras were replaced by the Pandyas in the south and by the Pallavas in the north. Even with the exit of the Kalabhras, the Jain and Buddhist influence still remained in Tamil Nadu. The early Pandya and the Pallava kings were followers of these faiths. The Hindu reaction to this apparent decline of their religion was growing and reached its peak during the later part of the 7th century. There was a widespread Hindu revival during which a huge body of Saiva and Vaishnava literature was created. Many Saiva Nayanmars and Vaishnava Alvars provided a great stimulus to the growth of popular devotional literature. Karaikkal Ammaiyar who lived in the 6th century CE was the earliest of these Nayanmars. The celebrated Saiva hymnists Sundaramoorthy, Thirugnana Sambanthar and Thirunavukkarasar (also known as \"Appar\") were of this period. Of Appar's verses 3066 have survived. Sambandar sang 4,169 verses. Together these form the first six books of the Saiva canon, collected by Nambi Andar Nambi in the 10th century. Sundarar wrote \"Tiruttondartokai\" which gives the list of sixty-two Nayanmars. This was later elaborated by Sekkilar in his \"Periyapuranam\"(4,272 verses). Manikkavasagar, who lived around the 8th century CE was a minister in the Pandya court. His \"Tiruvasakam\" consisting of over 600 verses is noted for its passionate devotion.. These Saivite Hymns collectively called Thirumurai (திருமுறை) is described as SIXTH VEDA next to Bhagavath Geetha in Hindu Tradition.\n\nAlong with the Saiva Nayanmars, Vaishnava Alvars were also producing devotional hymns and their songs were collected later into the Four Thousand Sacred Hymns (\"Naalayira Divyap Prabhandham\"). The three earliest Alvars were Poygai, Pudam and Pey. Each of these wrote one hundred \"Venpas\". Tirumalisai Alwar who was a contemporary of the Pallava Mahendravarman I wrote such works as \"Naanmugantiruvadiandadi\". Tirumangai Alvar who lived in the 8th century CE was a more prolific writer and his works constitute about a third of the Diyaprabhandam. Periyalvar and his adopted daughter Andal contributed nearly 650 hymns to the Vaishnava canon. Andal symbolised purity and love for the God and wrote her hymns addressing Vishnu as a lover. The hymn of Andal which starts with \"Vaaranam Aayiram\" (One Thousand Elephants) tells of her dream wedding to Vishnu and is sung even today at Tamil Vaishnava weddings. Nammalvar, who lived in the 9th century, wrote \"Tiruvaimoli\". It comprises 1,101 stanzas and is held in great esteem for its elucidation of the Upanishads. This corpus was collected by Nathamuni, around 950 CE and formed the classical and vernacular basis for Sri Vaishnavism. These Hymns 'Naalayira Divya-p-Prabhandham' is respected at par with Vedas by Sri Vaishnavites in sanctity and holiness and hence referred to as 'Dravida Vedam' (திராவிட வேதம்).\n\n\"Cilappatikaram\" is one of the outstanding works of general literature of this period. The authorship and exact date of the classic \"Cilappatikaram\" are not definitely known. Ilango Adigal, who is credited with this work was reputed to be the brother of the Sangam age Chera king Senguttuvan. However we have no information of such a brother in the numerous poems sung on the Chera king. The \"Cilappatikaram\" is unique in its vivid portrayal of the ancient Tamil land. This is unknown in other works of this period. \"Cilappatikaram\" and its companion epic \"Manimekalai\" are Jain in philosophy. \"Manimekalai\" was written by Sattanar who was a contemporary of Ilango Adigal. Manimekalai contains a long exposition of fallacies of logic which is considered to be based on the 5th century Sanskrit work \"Nyayapravesa\" by Dinnag. Kongu Velir, a Jain author wrote \"Perunkathai\" based on the Sanskrit \"Brihat-katha\". \"Valayapathi\" and \"Kundalakesi\" are the names of two other narrative poems of this period written by a Jain and a Buddhist author respectively. These works have been lost and only a few poems of \"Valayapathi\" have been found so far.\n\nThe medieval period was the period of the Imperial Cholas when the entire south India was under a single administration. The period between the 11th and the 13th centuries, during which the Chola power was at its peak, there were relatively few foreign incursions and the life for the Tamil people was one of peace and prosperity. It also provided the opportunity for the people to interact with cultures beyond their own, as the Cholas ruled over most of the South India, Sri Lanka and traded with the kingdoms in southeast Asia. The Cholas built numerous temples, mainly for their favourite god Siva, and these were celebrated in numerous hymns. The \"Prabhanda\" became the dominant form of poetry. The religious canons of Saiva and Vaishnava sects were beginning to be systematically collected and categorised. Nambi Andar Nambi, who was a contemporary of Rajaraja Chola I, collected and arranged the books on Saivism into eleven books called \"Tirumurais\". The hagiology of Saivism was standardised in \"Periyapuranam\" (also known as \"Tiruttondar Puranam\") by Sekkilar, who lived during the reign of Kulothunga Chola II (1133–1150 CE). Religious books on the Vaishnava sect were mostly composed in Sanskrit during this period. The great Vaishnava leader Ramanuja lived during the reigns of Athirajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola I, and had to face religious persecution from the Cholas who belonged to the Saiva sect. One of the best known Tamil works of this period is the \"Ramavatharam\" by Kamban who flourished during the reign of Kulottunga III. \"Ramavatharam\" is the greatest epic in Tamil Literature, and although the author states that he followed Valmiki, his work is not a mere translation or even an adaptation of the Sanskrit epic. Kamban imports into his narration the colour and landscape of his own time. A contemporary of Kamban was the famous poet Auvaiyar who found great happiness in writing for young children. Her works, \"Athichoodi\" and \"Konraiventhan\" are even now generally read and taught in schools in Tamil Nadu. Her two other works, \"Mooturai\" and \"Nalvali\" were written for slightly older children. All the four works are didactic in character. They explain the basic wisdom that should govern mundane life.\n\nOf the books on the Buddhist and the Jain faiths, the most noteworthy is the \"Jivaka-chintamani\" by the Jain ascetic Thirutakkadevar composed in the 10th century. \"Viruttam\" style of poetry was used for the first time for the verses in this book. The five Tamil epics \"Jivaka-chintamani\", \"Cilappatikaram\", \"Manimekalai\", \"Kundalakesi\" and \"Valayapathi\" are collectively known as The Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature. There were a number of books written on Tamil grammar. \"Yapperungalam\" and \"Yapperungalakkarigai\" were two works on prosody by the Jain ascetic Amirtasagara. Buddamitra wrote \"Virasoliyam\", another work on Tamil grammar, during the reign of Virarajendra Chola. \"Virasoliyam\" attempts to find synthesis between Sanskrit and Tamil grammar. Other grammatical works of this period are \"Nannul\" by Pavanandi, \"Vaccanandi Malai\" by Neminatha, and the annotations on the puram theme, \"Purapporul Venpamalai\" by Aiyanaridanar.\n\nThere were biographical and political works such as Jayamkondar's Kalingattuparani, a semi-historical account on the two invasion of Kalinga by Kulothunga Chola I. Jayamkondar was a poet-laureate in the Chola court and his work is a fine example of the balance between fact and fiction the poets had to tread. Ottakuttan, a close contemporary of Kambar, wrote three \"Ulas\" on Vikrama Chola, Kulothunga Chola II and Rajaraja Chola II\n\nTamil Muslim literature is eight centuries old. The earliest literary works of this coterie could be traced to the 14th century in the form of \"Palsanthmalai\", a small work of eight stanzas. In 1572, Seyku Issaku, better known as Vanna Parimala Pulavar, published \"Aayira Masala Venru Vazhankum Adisaya Puranam\" detailing the Islamic principles and beliefs in a FAQ format. In 1592, Aali Pulavar wrote the \"Mikurasu Malai\".\n\nThe period from 1300 CE to 1650 was a period of constant change in the political situation of Tamil Nadu. The Tamil country was invaded by the armies of the Delhi Sultanate and defeated the Pandya kingdom. The collapse of the Delhi Sultanate triggered the rise of the Bahmani Sultans in the Deccan. Vijayanagar empire rose from the ashes of the kingdoms of Hoysalas and Chalukyas and eventually conquered the entire south India. The Vijayanagar kings appointed regional governors to rule various territories of their kingdom and Tamil Nadu was ruled by the Madurai Nayaks, Thanjavur Nayaks and Gingee Nayaks. This period saw a large output of philosophical works, commentaries, epics and devotional poems. A number of monasteries (\"Mathas\") were established by the various Hindu sects and these began to play a prominent role in educating the people. Numerous authors were of either the Saiva or the Vaishnava sects. The Vijayanagar kings and their Nayak governors were ardent Hindus and they patronised these \"mathas\". Although the kings and the governors of the Vijayanagar empire spoke Kannada and Telugu they encouraged the growth of Tamil literature as we find no slowing down in the literary output during this period.\n\nThere was a large output of works of philosophical and religious in nature, such as the \"Sivananabodam\" by Meykandar. At the end of the 14th century Svarupananda Desikar wrote two anthologies on the philosophy os \"Advaita\", the \"Sivaprakasapperundirattu\". Arunagirinathar who lived in Tiruvannamalai in the 14th century wrote \"Tiruppugal\". Around 1360 verses of unique lilt and set to unique metres these poems are on the god Muruga. Madai Tiruvengadunathar, an official in the court of the Madurai Nayak, wrote \"Meynanavilakkam\" on the Advaita Vedanta. Siva prakasar, in the early 17th century wrote a number of works on the Saiva philosophy. Notable among these is the \"Nanneri\" which deals with moral instructions. A considerable par to the religious and philosophical literature of the age took the form of \"Puranas\" or narrative epics. A number of these were written on the various deities of the temples in Tamil Nadu and are known as Sthala Puranas, based on legend and folklore. One of the most important of the epics was the Mahabharatam by Villiputturar. He translated Vyasa's epic into Tamil and named it \"Villibharatam\". \"Kanthapuranam\" on the god Murugan was written by Kacchiappa Sivachariyar who lived in the 15th century. This work was based broadly on the Sanskrit \"Skandapurana\". Varatungarama Pandya, a Pandya king of the period was a littérateur of merit and wrote \"Paditrruppattanthathi\". He also translated into Tamil the erotic book known as \"Kokkoha\" from Sanskrit.\n\nThis period also an age of many commentaries of ancient Tamil works. Adiyarkunallar wrote an annotation on Cilappatikaram. Senavaraiyar wrote a commentary on the Tolkappiyam. Then came the famous Parimelalagar whose commentary on the Tirukkural is still considered one of the best available. Other famous annotators such as Perasiriyar and Naccinarikiniyar wrote commentaries on the various work of Sangam literature. The first Tamil dictionary was attempted by Mandalapurusha who compiled the lexicon \"Nigandu Cudamani\". Thayumanavar, who lived in the early 18th century, is famous for a number of short poems of philosophical nature.\n\nThe 17th century altruist Syed Khader, known colloquially as Seethakaathi, was a great patron of all Tamil poets. He commissioned Umaruppulavar to pen the first biography of Nabi. The collection of poems was called \"Seerapuranam\". The 17th century also saw for the first time literary works by Christian authors. Costanzo Giuseppe Beschi (1680–1746), better known as Veeramamunivar, compiled the first dictionary in Tamil. His \"Chathurakarathi\" was the first to list the Tamil words in alphabetical order. Veeramamunivar is also remembered for his Christian theological epic \"Thembavani\" on the life and teaching of Jesus Christ.\n\nDuring the 18th and the 19th century Tamil Nadu witnessed some of the most profound changes in the political scene. The traditional Tamil ruling clans were superseded by European colonists and their sympathisers. The Tamil society underwent a deep cultural shock with the imposition of western cultural influences. The Hindu religious establishments attempted to stem the tide of change and to safeguard the Tamil cultural values. Notable among these were the Saiva monasteries at Tiruvavaduthurai, Dharmapuram, Thiruppananthal and Kundrakudi. Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai(1815–1876) was a Tamil scholar who taught Tamil at one of these monasteries. He wrote more than eighty books consisting of over 200,000 poems. He is more famous however for encouraging U.V.Swaminatha Iyer to go search for Tamil books that have been lost for centuries. Gopalakrishna Bharathi lived during the early 19th century. He wrote numerous poems and lyrics set to tune in Carnatic music. His most famous work is the \"Nandan Charitam\" on the life of Nandanar who having been born in a sociologically lower caste, faces and overcomes the social obstacles in achieving his dream of visiting the Chidambaram temple. This work is a revolutionary social commentary considering the period in which it was written, although Gopalakrishna Bharati expanded on the story in \"Periyapuranam\". Ramalinga Adigal (Vallalar) (1823–1874) wrote the devotional poem \"Tiruvarutpa\" is considered to be a work of great beauty and simplicity. Maraimalai Adigal (1876–1950) advocated for the purity of Tamil and wanted to clean it of words with Sanskrit influences. One of the great Tamil poets of this period was Subramanya Bharathi. His works are stimulating in their progressive themes like freedom and feminism. Bharathy introduced a new poetic style into the somewhat rigid style of Tamil poetry writing, which had followed the rules set down in the \"Tolkaappiyam\". His \"puthukkavithai\" (Lit.:new poetry) broke the rules and gave poets the freedom to express themselves. He also wrote Tamil prose in the form of commentaries, editorials, short stories and novels. Some of these were published in the Tamil daily \"Swadesamitran\" and in his Tamil weekly \"India\". Inspired by Bharathi, many poets resorted to poetry as a means of reform. Bharathidasan was one such poet. U.V.Swaminatha Iyer, was instrumental in the revival of interest in the Sangam age literature in Tamil Nadu. He travelled all over the Tamil country, collecting, deciphering and publishing ancient books such as \"Cilappatikaram\", \"Kuruntokai\", etc. He published over 90 books and wrote \"En caritham\", an autobiography.\n\nThe novel as a genre of literature arrived in Tamil in the third quarter of the 19th century, more than a century after it became popular with English writers. Its emergence was perhaps facilitated by the growing population of Tamils with a western education and exposure to popular English fiction. Mayavaram Vedanayagam Pillai wrote the first Tamil novel \"Prathapa Mudaliar Charithram\" in 1879. This was a romance with an assortment of fables, folk tales and even Greek and Roman stories, written with the entertainment of the reader as the principal motive. It was followed by \"Kamalambal Charitram\" by B. R. Rajam Iyer in 1893 and \"Padmavathi Charitram\" by A. Madhaviah in 1898. These two portray the life of Brahmins in 19th century rural Tamil Nadu, capturing their customs and habits, beliefs and rituals. Although it was primarily a powerful narration of the common man's life in a realistic style spiced with natural humour, Rajam Iyer's novel has a spiritual and philosophical undertone. Madhaviah tells the story in a more realistic way with a searching criticism of the upper caste society, particularly the sexual exploitation of girls by older men. D.Jayakanthan has enriched the high traditions of literary traditions of Tamil language and contributed towards the shaping of Indian literature. His literature presents a deep and sensitive understanding of complex human nature and is an authentic and vivid index of Indian reality. One famous novel of his is Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal.\nSince the 1990s the post modernist writers emerged as a major figures, including Jeyamohan, S.Ramakrishnan, Charu Nivedita. The critically acclaimed works include Vishnupuram by Jeymohan, Ubapandavam by S.Ramakrishnan, Zero degree by Charu Niveditha, Konangi ( Paazhi), yumaa vasuki – Ratha vurvu (Blood Relation), Lakshmi Manivannan (appavin Thottathil neer payum idangal ellam ...), nakulan – ninivu-p-padhai., and Konangi, who mixes classical Tamil inflections with experimental sound poets.\n\nThere are other less appreciated works involving those translated from other languages, which are often unrecognized by Tamil pundits. The works include \"Urumaatram\" (translation of Franz Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\"), \"Siluvayil Thongum Saathaan\" (translation of \"Devil on the Cross\" by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o), \"Thoongum azhagigalin Illam\" (translation of \"House of Sleeping Beauties\" by Yasunari Kawabata). Writers like Amarantha, Latha Ramakrishnan are responsible for these works.\n\nThe increasing demand of the literate public caused a number of journals and periodicals to be published and these in turn provided a platform for authors to publish their work. \"Rajavritti Bodhini\" and \"Dina Varthamani\" in 1855 and Salem Pagadala Narasimhalu Naidu's fortnightlies, Salem \"Desabhimini\" in 1878 and \"Coimbatore Kalanidhi\" in 1880, were the earliest Tamil journals. In 1882, G. Subramaniya Iyer started the newspaper \"Swadesamitran\". It became the first Tamil daily in 1889. This was the start of many journals to follow and many novelists began to serialise their stories in these journal. The humour magazine \"Ananda Vikatan\" started by S.S. Vasan in 1929 was to help create some of the greatest Tamil novelists. Kalki Krishnamurthy (1899–1954) serialised his short stories and novels in \"Ananda Vikatan\" and eventually started his own weekly \"Kalki\" for which he wrote the enduringly popular novels \"Parthiban Kanavu\", \"Sivagamiyin Sabadham\" and \"Ponniyin Selvan\". Pudhumaipithan (1906–1948) was a great writer of short stories and provided the inspiration for a number of authors who followed him. The 'new poetry or \"pudukkavithai\" pioneered by Bharathi in his prose-poetry was further developed by the literary periodicals \"manikkodi\" and \"ezhuttu\" (edited by Si Su Chellappa). Poets such as Mu Metha contributed to these periodicals. Tamil Muslim poets like Kavikko Abdul Rahman, Pavalar Inqulab, Manushyaputhiran and Rajathi Salma too have made significant contributions to social reforms. The pioneering fortnightly journal \"Samarasam\" was established in 1981 to highlight and cater to the ethnic Tamil Muslim community's issues.\nAnother remarkable work was done in Tamil novel field by Mu.Varatharasanar.[Agal vilakku] [Karithundu]. And last but not least Akilan the unique Tamil novelist, short story writer and a social activist is famous for his works like 'Chithirapavai' 'Vengayinmaindan' 'Pavaivilaku'.\n\nThe first Tamil periodical was published by the Christian Religious Tract Society in 1831 – \"The Tamil Magazine\".\n\nThe increasing demand of the literate public caused a number of journals and periodicals to be published and these in turn provided a platform for authors to publish their work. Rajavritti Bodhini and Dina Varthamani in 1855 and Salem Pagadala Narasimhalu Naidu's fortnightlies, Salem Desabhimini in 1878 and Coimbatore Kalanidhi in 1880, were the earliest Tamil journals.\n\nThe first regular newspaper in Tamil was Swadesamitran in 1882, started by G.Subramaniya Iyer, editor and sponsor of The Hindu and founding member of the Indian National Congress. He created a whole new Tamil political vocabulary. He) was conscious that those with a knowledge of English are a small number and those with a knowledge of Indian languages the vast majority. He felt that unless our people were told about the objectives of British rule and its merits and defects in the Indian languages, our political knowledge would never develop. When Subramania Aiyer quit The Hindu 1898, he made the Swadesamitran his full-time business. In 1899, the first Tamil daily. It was to enjoy this status for 17 years.\n\nSubramania Aiyer's \"pugnacious style, never qualifying words to soften the sharp tenor of a sentence,\" his use of words \"dipped in a paste of extra pungent green chillies,\" made the Swadesamitran sought by Tamils wherever they lived in the world. And the daily became even more popular when Subramania Bharati joined it in 1904. The next year, when Lala Lajpat Rai was arrested and agitation followed in the Punjab, Subramania Aiyer's attitude to the British changed and he became a trenchant political critic of the Raj. His whole political mantra can be summed up in these words: `Peaceful but tireless and unceasing effort.' Let us sweat ourselves into Swaraj, he would seem to say.\" Swadesamitran is credited for coining new Tamil words to deal with science, politics and administration. It had the most comprehensive budget of news among all the regional language papers of that time.\n\nIn 1917, \"Desabhaktan\", another Tamil daily began with T.V. Kalyansundara Menon as editor. He was succeeded by V.V.S. Iyer, a colleague of the Savarkar brothers. These two editors were scholars with a natural, highly readable but polished style of writing.\n\nThe freedom movement and the advent of Gandhi also impacted Tamil journalism. Navasakthi, a Tamil periodical edited by Tamil scholar and freedom fighter V. Kalyanasundaram. C.Rajagopalachari began Vimochanam, a Tamil journal devoted to propagating prohibition at the Gandhi Ashram in Tiruchengode in Salem district.\n\nIn 1926, P. Varadarajulu Naidu, who was conducting a Tamil news-cum-views weekly 'Tamil Nadu' started a daily with the same name. Its forceful and colloquial style gained it a wide readership but after the paper failed to take sides with the 1930 Civil Disobedience Movement, the Congress Party decided to bring out a new Tamil daily – India, edited by renowned poet Subramania Bharati. India showed great promise but could not establish itself financially, and folded up soon after Bharati was exiled to Pondicherry. All these papers were published from Madras.\n\nIn 1933, the first Tamil tabloid – the 8 page Jayabharati began at a price of anna. It closed in 1940 as the price could not sustain even its postage.\n\nIn September 1934, S. Sadanand (who was running The Free Press Journal) started the Tamil daily Dinamani with T.S. Chockalingam as editor. It was priced at 6 pies, contained bright features and was fearlessly critical. It was highly successful and its circulation eclipsed the total circulation of all other Tamil dailies. Soon 'India' was incorporated into Dinamani. Dinamani made a studied and conscious effort to make the contents of a newspaper intelligible even to the newly literate. \nIn 1935, Viduthalai was begun, but it was more of a views-paper than a newspaper. \nThe Non-Brahman Movement also gave an impetus to Tamil journalism. Newspapers like the \"Bharat Devi\" were strong supporters of this movement.\n\nMany magazines began in Tamil Nadu during the 1920s and '30s. The humour magazine Ananda Vikatan started by S.S. Vasan in 1929 was to help create some of the greatest Tamil novelists. It is still running successfully after 80 years and the Vikatan group today also publishes Chutti Vikatan, Junior Vikatan, Motor Vikatan and other special interest magazines. R. Krishnamurthy serialised his short stories and novels in Ananda Vikatan and eventually started his own weekly Kalki. The name Kalki denotes the impending tenth Avatar of Lord Vishnu in the Hindu religion, who it is said, will bring to an end the Kali Yuga and reinstate Dharma or righteousness among the worldly beings. He used the name because he wanted to bring about liberation of India.\n\nIn 1942, Dina Thanthi (\"Daily Telegraph\") was started in Madurai with simultaneous editions in Madras, Salem and Tiruchirappalli. It was founded by S.P. Adithanar, a lawyer trained in Britain. He modeled Thanthi on the style of an English tabloid- The Daily Mirror. He aimed to bring out a newspaper that ordinary people would read, and which would encourage a reading habit even among the newly literate. In the past, the daily newspaper which was printed in Madras reached the southern Tamil region after at least one day. Thanthi used the public bus system to distribute the paper throughout the south Tamil region and capitalized on the hunger for war news that arose after Singapore fell to the Japanese. Due to financial constraints, its Salem and Tiruchirappalli editions had to be closed down for a while. Thanthi emphasized local news, especially crime and the courts. It used photographs extensively and brought banner headlines to Tamil journalism. It could fit one story on an entire broadsheet page, mainly filled with large easy-to-read headlines. One of its biggest scoops was the murder of the editor of a scandalous film magazine by two actors. Thanthi covered the trial in Madras in detail, and its reporters phoned the daily account to the printing centre in Madurai. Thanthi was the first Tamil paper to understand the people’s fascination with crime and film stars. The paper was popular and it was said that Tamils learned to read in order to read the newspaper.\n\nDina Thanthi became one of the largest Tamil language dailies by circulation within a few years; it has been a leading Tamil daily since the 1960s. It has today 14 editions. It is the highest circulated Tamil daily in Bangalore and Pondicherry. It issues a book called 10th, +2 Vina Vidai Book, on every Wednesday during the second part of the year. The model question papers of all the subjects of Standard 10 and 12 are provided with answers along with the question papers of board exams that are conducted previous year.\n\nCrime and detective fiction has enjoyed wide popularity in Tamil Nadu since the 1930s. Popular authors in the years before independence included Kurumbur Kuppusami and Vaduvur Duraisami Iyengar. In the 1950s and '60s, Tamilvanan's detective hero Shankarlal carried readers to a variety of foreign locales, while using a pure Tamil with very few Hindi or English loan words. These writers are often extremely prolific, with hundreds or even thousands of short novels to their credit, and one or more short novel published in a monthly periodical. Indra Soundar Rajan, another popular modern author, writes supernatural crime thrillers usually based around Hindu mythology.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s Kalki Krishnamurthy was notable for his historical and social fiction.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s, Chandilyan wrote a number of very popular historical romance novels set in medieval India or on medieval trade routes with Malaysia, Indonesia and Europe.\n\nFrom the 1950s, spanning six decades, Jayakanthan authored around 40 novels, 200 short stories, apart from two autobiographies. Outside literature, he made two films. In addition, four of his other novels were adapted into films by others. His works revolve around the lives of underclass people like rickshaw-pullers, prostitutes and rag-pickers.\n\nArunaa Nandhini is one of recent Tamil novelists who has entered the hearts of many Tamil readers, and her story covers family subject, romance, reality, with some humor added for the readers to enjoy their leisure.\n\nModern romance novels are represented by the current bestselling author in the Tamil language, Ramanichandran.\n\nThough sales of Tamil pulp fiction have declined since the hey-day of the mid-1990s, and many writers have turned to the more lucrative television serial market, there remains a thriving scene.\n\nThe rise of the Internet has triggered a dramatic growth in the number of Tamil blogs and specialist portals catering to political and social issues. Tamil literature is even available in the form of e-books.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "179870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179870", "title": "Texas German", "text": "Texas German\n\nTexas German () is a German language dialect spoken by descendants of German immigrants who settled in Texas in the mid-19th century. These \"German Texans\" founded the towns of Bulverde, New Braunfels, Fredericksburg, Boerne, Walburg, and Comfort in Texas Hill Country, Muenster in North Central Texas, and Schulenburg and Weimar to the east.\n\nWhile most heritage languages in the United States die out by the third generation, Texas German is unusual in that most German Texans continued to speak German in their homes and communities for several generations after settling in the state, the State of Texas recognized German as having equal status to Spanish from 1846 up until World War I, when Texas education rules were established mandating English-only instruction, requiring children to learn English in school regardless of what was spoken outside it. Due to the assimilation of these communities and public hostility towards the German language during both World War I and World War II, Texas German speakers drifted towards English and few passed the language to their descendants. By 1950, the number of new speakers of the language was virtually zero.\n\nThe dialect is near extinction, as it is now spoken almost exclusively by a few elderly German Texans. Currently, Dr. Hans Boas at the University of Texas is recording and studying the dialect, building on research originally performed by Dr. Glenn Gilbert of Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1960s.\n\nBoas' book on the language, \"The Life and Death of Texas German\", describes the German dialects which may have been the source of the language spoken in Texas.\n\nA feature-length documentary project named \"All Güt Things\" is currently being developed about the language and will be completed by April 2017.\n\nSome 1,035 people report speaking German at home in Fredericksburg, the town with the largest community of Texas German speakers, representing 12.48% of the total population, 840 in New Braunfels, 150 in Schulenburg, 85 in Stonewall, 70 in Boerne, 65 in Harper, 45 in Comfort and 19 in Weimar, all of which except for Schulenburg and Weimar, lie in the traditional Texas German heartland of the Hill Country. Gillespie County, with the communities of Fredericksburg, Harper, Stonewall, and Luckenbach, has a German-speaking population of 2,270, 11.51% of the county's total. In all, 82,100 German-speakers reside in the state of Texas, including European German speakers.\n\nTexas German is adapted to U.S. measurement and legal terminologies. German words were invented or English was \"Germanicized\" for words not present in 19th-century German. In some cases, these new words also exist in modern Standard German, but with a different meaning. For instance, the word \"Luftschiff\" (used for \"airplane\") means airship in Standard German.\n\nThe table below illustrates some examples of differences:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8054500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8054500", "title": "Total loss", "text": "Total loss\n\nIn insurance claims, a total loss or write-off is a situation where the lost value, repair cost or salvage cost of a damaged property exceeds its insured value. \n\nSuch a loss may be an \"actual total loss\" or a \"constructive total loss\". Constructive total loss considers further incidental expenses beyond repair, such as \"force majeure\". \n\nIn a total loss, the insurer must indemnify the assured in full, and ownership of the insured item thereby passes to the insurer under the legal process of \"subrogation\". Although the policy determines the level at which the loss becomes total rather than partial, nevertheless the assured (and NOT the insurer) has the final say as to whether he wishes to make a partial or total claim. \n\nIf the insured item is, say, a car or a house, the policy will normally give it a \"market value\" which may be less than the assured had in mind; any disagreement would need to be challenged, perhaps using arbitration. In marine insurance, policies may be valued (where the value of the ship or cargo is agreed) or unvalued (where a market value at the time of the claim would need to be ascertained). In the absence of fraud, the Marine Insurance Act 1906 states the agreed value in a valued policy is conclusive, except in cases of constructive total loss, as in \"The Costa Concordia\" and \"The Bamburi\".\n\nWritten off properties are usually demolished or torn down, scrapped, or recycled for parts after their policies are settled; so the insurer may be relieved not to have the insured item surrogated to him, as in \"Asfar v Blundell\" [1896].\n\nPolicies covering homes, vehicles, and other non-investment assets subject to depreciation may indemnify the insured to much less than the full replacement cost, so that the insured items may become \"total losses\" despite some residual value. \n\nAbout one in seven car accident claims results in a \"total\". Except in extreme circumstances, a vehicle that has been written off will not be completely worthless. This is because such a vehicle will usually still contain salvageable used parts, or at a bare minimum will still have value as scrap metal. All that is required for a vehicle to be a write-off is that it would cost more to return to marketable condition than the market value it would then have. So a vehicle of low value may even be written off when fully roadworthy, for example due to damage to paintwork or upholstery.\nIn many jurisdictions a vehicle designated as a total loss is sold by insurance companies to general public, auto dealers, auto brokers, or auto wreckers. The metrics insurance companies use to make the decision include the cost of the repairs needed plus the value of the remaining parts, added to the cost of reimbursing the driver for a rental while the car in question is repaired. If this figure exceeds the value of the car after it is repaired, the vehicle is deemed a total loss. In most jurisdictions, a decision by an insurer to write off a vehicle results in vehicle title branding, marking the car as \"salvage\" or (if repaired and reinspected under subsequent ownership) \"rebuilt\". If the vehicle is not severely damaged, however, it can be restored to its original condition. After a government approved inspection, the vehicle can be put back on the road. The inspection process may not attempt to assess the quality of the repairs. This function will be relegated to a professional mechanic or inspector. However, if the vehicle is severely damaged as per standards set by state or provincial governments, the vehicle is dismantled by an auto wrecker and is sold as parts or scrapped.\n\nOnce a vehicle has been written off and repaired the vehicle may still lose value. Diminished value is the reduction in a vehicle's market value occurring after a vehicle is wrecked and repaired, otherwise called accelerated depreciation. To collect diminished value after a car accident, insurance companies usually ask for a diminished value report.\n\nIn Canada, this is more commonly called \"accelerated depreciation\"; how a person goes about reclaiming those losses in either country is a different process. In some US states, insurance companies acknowledge diminished value and provide this coverage direct to their consumers. In Canada, in order to recuperate the lost value after an accident, a person needs to retain legal counsel and order an acceleration depreciation report on their car for the court's use.\n\nIn marine insurance, conventional marine insurers such as Lloyds will issue policies covering hull & machinery, or cargo, whereas P&I clubs cover third-party risks (such as a carrier's damage to cargo), pollution risks, and war risks. The term \"total loss\" can refer to any of these risks, but commonly involves a loss of the hull or cargo. Total losses may be actual total loss or constructive. \n\nAn actual total loss of a vessel occurs when repair is physically or legally impossible. A total loss may be presumed when a ship disappears and no news is received within a reasonable time. Some legal authorities do not consider it an actual total loss if repair costs are merely prohibitive, while others include cases where the cost of repair would exceed the cost of the vessel. In any case, the term \"legally impossible\" covers instances where reconstruction would be so extensive that the resulting craft would be legally considered a new vessel.\n\nA constructive total loss is a situation where the cost of repairs plus the cost of salvage equal or exceed the value of the vessel. It also covers cases where the vessel has been abandoned in the reasonable belief that a total loss is inevitable. The calculation can be affected by environmental cleanup costs.\n\nIf the policy is a \"valued\" policy (so that the ship or cargo has an \"agreed value\" rather than a \"market value\"), then, in the absence of fraud, the agreed value is conclusive, but only for an actual total loss. In a constructive total loss, the agreed value is NOT conclusive.\n\nIn aviation, the term \"hull loss\" is used in aviation accidents that damage the aircraft beyond economical repair, resulting in a total loss. The term also applies to situations when the aircraft is missing, the search for its wreckage is terminated, or when the wreckage is completely inaccessible.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32665", "title": "Voice-over", "text": "Voice-over\n\nVoiceover (also known as off-camera or off-stage commentary) is a production technique where a voice—that is not part of the narrative (non-diegetic)—is used in a radio, television production, filmmaking, theatre, or other presentations. The voiceover is read from a script and may be spoken by someone who appears elsewhere in the production or by a specialist voice talent. Synchronous dialogue, where the voiceover is narrating the action that is taking place at the same time, remains the most common technique in voiceovers. Asynchronous, however, is also used in cinema. It is usually prerecorded and placed over the top of a film or video and commonly used in documentaries or news reports to explain information. Voiceovers are used in video games and on-hold messages, as well as for announcements and information at events and tourist destinations. It may also be read live for events such as award presentations.\n\nVoiceover is added in addition to any existing dialogue, and it is not to be confused with the process of \"replacing\" dialogue with a translated version, which is called \"dubbing\" or \"revoicing\".\n\nIn Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" (1956), Ishmael (Richard Basehart) narrates the story, and he sometimes comments on the action in voiceover, as does Joe Gillis (William Holden) in \"Sunset Boulevard (1950)\" and Eric Erickson (William Holden) in \"The Counterfeit Traitor (1962)\"; adult Pip (John Mills) in \"Great Expectations (1946 film)\" and Michael York in a television remake (1974).\n\nVoiceover technique is likewise used to give voices and personalities to animated characters. Noteworthy and versatile voice actors include Mel Blanc, Daws Butler, Don Messick, Paul Frees, and June Foray.\n\nCharactering techniques in voiceovers are used to give personalities and voice to fictional characters. There has been some controversy with charactering techniques in voiceovers, particularly with white radio entertainers who would mimic black speech patterns. Radio made this racial mockery easier to get away with because it was a non-confrontational platform to freely express anything the broadcasters found fit. It also became the ideal medium for voice impersonations. Characterization has always been popular in culture and all forms of media. In the late 1920s radio started to stray away from reporting exclusively on musicals and sporting events, instead, radio began to create serial talk shows as well as shows with fictional storylines. The technique of characterization can be a creative outlet to expand on film and radio, but it must be done carefully.\n\nIn film, the filmmaker places the sound of a human voice (or voices) over images shown on the screen that may or may not be related to the words that are being spoken. Consequently, voiceovers are sometimes used to create ironic counterpoint. Also, sometimes they can be random voices not directly connected to the people seen on the screen. In works of fiction, the voiceover is often by a character reflecting on his or her past, or by a person external to the story who usually has a more complete knowledge of the events in the film than the other characters.\n\nvoiceovers are often used to create the effect of storytelling by a character/omniscient narrator. For example, in \"The Usual Suspects\", the character of Roger \"Verbal\" Kint has voiceover segments as he is recounting details of a crime. Classic voiceovers in cinema history can be heard in \"Citizen Kane\" and \"The Naked City\".\n\nSometimes, voiceover can be used to aid continuity in edited versions of films, in order for the audience to gain a better understanding of what has gone on between scenes. This was done when the film \"Joan of Arc (1948),\" starring Ingrid Bergman, turned out to be far from the box-office and critical hit that was expected, and it was edited down from 145 minutes to 100 minutes for its second run in theaters. The edited version, which circulated for years, used narration to conceal the fact that large chunks of the film had been cut out. In the full-length version, restored in 1998 and released on DVD in 2004, the voiceover narration is heard only at the beginning of the film.\n\nFilm noir is especially associated with the voiceover technique. The golden age of first-person narration was during the 1940s. Film noir typically used male voiceover narration but there are a few rare female voiceovers.\n\nIn radio, voiceovers are an integral part of the creation of the radio program. The voiceover artist might be used to remind listeners of the station name or as characters to enhance or develop show content. During the 1980s, the British broadcasters Steve Wright and Kenny Everett used voiceover artists to create a virtual \"posse\" or studio crew who contributed to the programmes. It is believed that this principle was in play long before that time. The American radio broadcaster Howard Stern has also used voiceovers in this way.\n\nThe voiceover has many applications in non-fiction as well. Television news is often presented as a series of video clips of newsworthy events, with voiceover by the reporters describing the significance of the scenes being presented; these are interspersed with straight video of the news anchors describing stories for which video is not shown.\n\nTelevision networks such as The History Channel and the Discovery Channel make extensive use of voiceovers. On NBC, the television show \"Starting Over\" used Sylvia Villagran as the voiceover narrator to tell a story.\n\nLive sports broadcasts are usually shown as extensive voiceovers by sports commentators over video of the sporting event.\n\nGame shows formerly made extensive use of voiceovers to introduce contestants and describe available or awarded prizes, but this technique has diminished as shows have moved toward predominantly cash prizes. The most prolific have included Don Pardo, Johnny Olson, John Harlan, Jay Stewart, Gene Wood and Johnny Gilbert.\n\nVoiceover commentary by a leading critic, historian, or by the production personnel themselves is often a prominent feature of the release of feature films or documentaries on DVDs.\n\nThe commercial use of voiceover in television advertising has been popular since the beginning of radio broadcasting.\n\nIn the early years, before effective sound recording and mixing, announcements were produced \"live\" and at-once in a studio with the entire cast, crew and, usually, orchestra. A corporate sponsor hired a producer, who hired writers and voice actors to perform comedy or drama.\n\nManufacturers will often use a distinctive voice to help them with brand messaging, often retaining talent to a long-term exclusive contract.\n\nThe industry expanded very rapidly with the advent of television in the 1950s, and the age of highly produced serial radio shows ended. The ability to record high-quality sound on magnetic tape also created opportunities. Digital recording—thanks to the proliferation of PCs, smartphones (iOS and Android 5.0+), dedicated recording devices, free or inexpensive recording and editing software, and USB microphones of reasonable quality, increasing use of home studios — has revolutionized the industry.\n\nThe sound recording industry uses the term \"presence\" as the standard of a good quality voiceover and is used for commercial purposes in particular. This term \"presence\" measures the legitimacy of how it sounds, specifically one of a voiceover. Advances in technology for sound recording have helped voiceovers reach this standard. These technological advances have worked continuously on diminishing \"the noise of the system...and thus reducing the distance perceived between the object and its representation.\" \n\nThe voice over industry works in tandem with the advertising industry to help deliver high quality branding and as a whole is worth millions. Commercial advertising that uses voiceovers reaches about 89 percent of all adults in Britain alone. \n\nIn some countries, such as Russia and Poland, voiceover provided by an artist is commonly used on television programs as a language localization technique, as an alternative to full dub localization.\n\nIn Bulgaria, multiple voiceover is also common, but each film (or episode) is normally voiced by three to six actors. The voice artists try to match the original voice and preserve the intonation. The main reason for the use of this type of translation is that unlike synchronized voice translation, it takes a relatively short time to produce, since there is no need to synchronize the voices with the character's lip movements, which is compensated by the quieted original audio. When there is no speaking in the film for some time, the original sound is turned up. Recently, as more films are distributed with separate voice and noises-and-music tracks, some voiceover translations in Bulgaria are produced by only turning down the voice track, in this way not affecting the other sounds. One actor always reads the translation crew's names over the show's ending credits (except for when there is dialogue over the credits).\n\n"}
{"id": "339817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339817", "title": "Wichita language", "text": "Wichita language\n\nWichita is an extinct Caddoan language once spoken in Oklahoma by the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. The last fluent heritage speaker, Doris Lamar-McLemore, died in 2016, although in 2007 there were three first-language speakers alive. This has rendered Wichita functionally extinct; however, the tribe offers classes to revitalize the language and works in partnership with the Wichita Documentation Project of the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nWhen the Europeans began to settle North America, Wichita separated into three dialects; Waco, Tawakoni, and Kirikiri:s (aka, Wichita Proper). However, when the language was threatened and the number of speakers decreased, dialect differences largely disappeared.\n\nAs late as 2007 there were three living native speakers, but the last known fluent native speaker, Doris Lamar-McLemore, died on 30 August 2016. This is a sharp decline from the 500 speakers estimated by Paul L. Garvin in 1950.\n\nWichita is a member of the Caddoan language family, along with modern Caddo, Pawnee, Arikara, and Kitsai.\n\nThe phonology of Wichita is unusual, with no pure labial consonants (though there are two labiovelars /kʷ/ and /w/. There is only one nasal (depending on conflicting theory one or more nasal sounds may appear, but all theories seem to agree that they are allophones of the same phoneme, at best), and possibly a three vowel system using only height for contrast.\n\nWichita has 10 consonants. In the Americanist orthography generally used when describing Wichita, is spelled , and is .\n\nThough neither Rood nor Garvin include nasals in their respective consonant charts for Wichita, Rood's later inclusion of nasals in phonetic transcription for his 2008 paper (\"Some Wichita Recollections: Aspects of Culture Reflected in Language\") support the appearance of at least .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWichita has either three or four vowels, depending on analysis:\n\nThese are transcribed as .\n\nWord-final vowels are devoiced.\n\nThough Rood employs the letter in his transcriptions, Garvin instead uses , and asserts that is a separate phoneme. However, considering the imprecision in vowel sound articulation, what is likely important about these transcriptions is that they attest to a back vowel that is not low.\n\nTaylor uses Garvin's transcription in his analysis, but theorizes a shift of *u to medially in Wichita, but does not have enough examples to fully analyze all the possible environments. He also discusses a potential shift from *a to , but again, does not have enough examples to develop a definitive hypothesis. Taylor finds only occurs with intervocalic glottal stops.\n\nRood argues that is not phonemic, as it is often equivalent to any vowel + + any vowel. For example, is frequently contracted to (the high tone is an effect of the elided consonant). There are \"relatively\" few cases where speakers will not accept a substitution of vowel + + vowel for ; one of them is 'eagle'.\n\nRood also proposes that, with three vowels that are arguably high, mid, and low, the front-back distinction is not phonemic, and that one may therefore speak of a 'vertical' vowel inventory (see below). This also has been claimed for relatively few languages, such as the Northwest Caucasian languages and the Ndu languages of Papua New Guinea.\n\nThere is clearly at least a two-way contrast in vowel length. Rood proposes that there is a three-way contrast, which is quite rare among the world's languages, although well attested for Mixe, and probably present in Estonian. However, in Wichita, for each of the three to four vowels qualities, one of the three lengths is rare, and in addition the extra-long vowels frequently involve either an extra morpheme, or suggest that prosody may be at work. For example,\n\nThis contrasts with Mixe, where it is easy to find a three-way length contrast without the addition of morphemes.\n\nUnder Rood's analysis, then, Wichita has 9 phonemic vowels:\n\nThere is also a contrastive high tone, indicated here by an acute accent.\n\nWhile vowel clusters are uncommon (unless the extra-long vowels are clusters), consonant clusters are ubiquitous in Wichita. Words may begin with clusters such as () and (). The longest cluster noted in Wichita is five consonants long, counting as a single consonant : 'while sleeping'. However, Wichita syllables are more commonly CV or CVC.\n\nWichita is an agglutinative, polysynthetic language, meaning words have a root verb basis to which information is added; that is, morphemes (affixes) are added to verb roots. These words may contain subjects, objects, indirect objects, and possibly indicate possession. Thus, surprisingly complex ideas can be communicated with as little as one word. For example, means \"one makes himself a fire\".\n\nNouns do not distinguish between singular and plural, as this information is specified as part of the verb. Wichita also does not distinguish between genders, which can be problematic for English language translation.\n\nSentence structure is much more fluid than in English, with words being organized according to importance or novelty. Often the subject of the sentence is placed initially. Linguist David S. Rood, who has written many papers concerning the Wichita language, recorded this example, as spoken by Bertha Provost (a native speaker, now deceased) in the late 1960s.\n\nThe subject of the sentence is ancestors, and thus the sentence begins with it, instead of God, or creation (when.he.made.us.dwell). This leads one to conclude Wichita has a largely free word-order, where parts of the sentence do not need to be located next to each other to be related.\n\nThe perfective tense demonstrates that an act has been completed; on the other hand, the intentive tense indicates that a subject plans or planned to carry out a certain act. The habitual aspect indicates a habitual activity, for example: \"he smokes\" but not \"he is smoking.\" Durative tense describes an activity, which is coextensive with something else.\n\nWichita has no indirect speech or passive voice. When using past tense, speakers must indicate if this knowledge of the past is based in hearsay or personal knowledge. Wichita speakers also use a morpheme which amounts to two versions of \"we\"; one that includes the listener, and one that does not. Wichita also differentiates between singular, dual and plural number, instead of the simpler singular or plural designations commonly found.\n\nSome Wichita affixes are:\n\nThe suffix is Rá:hir, added to the base. Another means of expressing instrument, used only for body parts, is a characteristic position of incorporation in the verb complex.\n\nOne of these tense-aspect prefixes must occur in any complete verb form.\n\nNote: kara (ought), alone, always means 'subject should', but in complex constructions it is used for hypothetical action, as in 'what would you do if…')\n\nThe aspect-marking suffixes are:\nOther prefixes and suffixes are as follows:\n\nExamples:\nɁarasi 'cook'\n\nIn the Wichita language, there are only case markings for obliques. Here are some examples:\n\n\nMost nouns take a locative suffix kiyah:\n\nBut a few take the verbal -hirih:\n\nAny verbal participle (i.e. any sentence) can be converted to a locative clause by the suffix -hirih\n\nWichita is a typical example of a polysynthetic language. Almost all the information in any simple sentence is expressed by means of bound morphemes in the verb complex. The only exception to this are (1) noun stems, specifically those functioning as agents of transitive verbs but sometimes those in other functions as well, and (2) specific modifying particles. A typical sentence from a story is the following:\n\nwá:cɁarɁa kiya:kíriwa:cɁárasarikìtàɁahí:rikss niya:hkʷírih\n\n\"wa:cɁarɁa\" 'squirrel'\n\n\"kiya\" 'quotative' + \"a...ki\" 'aorist' + \"a\" 'preverb' + \"Riwa:c\" 'big (quantity) + \"Ɂaras\" 'meat' + \"Ra\" 'collective' + \"ri\" 'portative' + \"kita\" 'top' + \"Ɂa\" 'come' + \"hi:riks\" 'repetitive' + \"s\" 'imperfective'\n\nna 'participle' + ya:k 'wood' + r 'collective' + wi 'be upright' + hrih 'locative'\n\n'The squirrel, by making many trips, carried the large quantity of meat up into the top of the tree, they say.'\n\nNote that 'squirrel' is the agent and occurs by itself with no morphemes indicating number or anything else. The verb, in addition to the verbal units of quotative, aorist, repetitive, and imperfective, also contain morphemes that indicate the agent is singular, the patient is collective, the direction of the action is to the top, and all the lexical information about the whole patient noun phrase, 'big quantity of meat'.\n\nIn the Wichita language, there is no gender distinction (WALS).\n\nThe verb 'have, possess' in Wichita is /uR ... Ɂi/, a combination of the preverb 'possessive' and the root 'be'. Possession of a noun can be expressed by incorporating that noun in this verb and indicating the person of the possessor by the subject pronoun:\n\nNouns can be divided into those that are countable and those that are not. In general, this correlates with the possibility for plural marking: Countable nouns can be marked for dual or plural; if not so marked, they are assumed to be singular. Uncountable nouns cannot be pluralized.\n\nThose incountable nouns that are also liquids are marked as such by a special morpheme, \"kir\".\n\nThose incountable nouns that are not liquid are not otherwise marked in Wichita. This feature is labeled dry mass. Forms such as \"ye:c\" 'fire', \"kirɁi:c\" 'bread', and \"ka:hi:c\" 'salt' are included in this category.\n\nWichita countable nouns are divided into those that are collective and those that are not. The collective category includes most materials, such as wood; anything that normally comes in pieces, such as meat, corn, or flour; and any containers such as pots, bowls, or sacks when they are filled with pieces of something.\n\nSome of the noncollective nominals are also marked for other selectional restrictions. In particular, with some verbs, animate nouns (including first and second person pronouns) require special treatment when they are patients in the sentence. Whenever there is an animate patient or object of certain verbs such as \"u...raɁa\" 'bring' or \"irasi\" 'find', the morpheme |hiɁri|(/hirɁ/, /hiɁr/, /hirɁi/) also occurs with the verb. The use of this morpheme is not predictable by rule and must be specified for each verb in the language that requires it.\n\nLike \"hiɁri\" 'patient is animate', the morpheme \"wakhahr\", means 'patient is an activity'.\n\nCountable nouns that are neither animate nor activities, such as chairs, apples, rocks, or body parts, do not require any semantic class agreement morphemes in the surface grammar of Wichita.\n\nThe morpheme |ra:k| marks any or all non-third persons in the sentence as plural.\n\nThe morpheme for 'collective' or 'patient is not singular'. The shape of this varies from verb to verb, but the collective is usually |ru|, |ra|, or |r|.\n\nThe noncollective plural is usually |Ɂak|. Instead of a morpheme here, some roots change form to mark plural. Examples include:\nA surface structure object in the non-third-person category can be clearly marked as singular, dual, or plural. The morpheme \"ra:k\" marks plurality; a combination oh \"hi\" and \"Ɂak\" marks dual. Singular is marked by zero.\n\nIf both agent and patient are third person, a few intransitive verbs permit the same distinctions for patients as are possible for non-third objects: singular, dual, and plural. These verbs (such as 'come' and 'sit') allow the morpheme \"wa\" to mark 'dual patient'. In all other cases the morphemes \"ru\", \"ra\", \"r\", or \"Ɂak\" means 'patient is plural'.\n\nAccording to the Ethnologue Languages of the World website, the status of the Wichita language is an 8b, meaning the language is nearly extinct. As of 2008, there was only one individual who is a native speaker of the Wichita language, Doris Jean Lamar McLemore. The reason for this is because the speakers of the Wichita language switched to speaking English. Thus, children were not being taught Wichita and only the elders knew the language. \"Extensive efforts to document and preserve the language\" are in effect through the Wichita Documentation Project.\n\nThe Wichita and Affiliated Tribes offers language classes, taught by Doris McLemore and Shirley Davilla. The tribe has created an immersion class for children and a class for adults. Linguist David Rood has collaborated with Wichita speakers to create a dictionary and language CDs. The tribe is collaborating with Rood of the University of Colorado, Boulder to document and teach the language through the Wichita Documentation Project.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33391080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33391080", "title": "Ye'kuana language", "text": "Ye'kuana language\n\nYe'kuana (), also known as Maquiritari, Dekwana, Ye'kwana, Ye'cuana, Yekuana, Cunuana, Kunuhana, De'cuana, De’kwana Carib, Pawana, Maquiritai, Maquiritare, Maiongong, or Soto is the language of the Ye'kuana people of Venezuela and Brazil. It is a Cariban language. It is spoken by approximately 5,900 people (c. 2001) around the border of northwestern Brazilian state of Roraima and Venezuela – the majority (about 5,500) in Venezuela. At the time of the 2001 Venezuelan census, there were at 6,523 Ye’kuana living in Venezuela. Given the unequal distribution of the Ye’kuana across two South American countries, \"Ethnologue\" lists two different vitality ratings for Ye’kuana: in Venezuela it is listed as Vigorous (6a), while in Brazil it is classified Moribund (8a) on the Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (GIDS).\n\nIn Brazil, the Ye’kuana are believed to have settled on the lands they now occupy more than a century ago, coming from the larger population centres in Venezuela. Traditional mythology and oral history, however, tells that the lands around the Auari and Uraricoera rivers have long been travelled by the Ye’kuana.\n\nDuring the 18th century, there was a lot of missionary activity in Ye'kuana territory, during which they were forced into constructing forts for the Spanish, and coerced into converting to Catholicism. A rebellion was organised against the Spanish in 1776. The 20th century brought a new wave of exploitation in the form of the colonists looking to capitalise on the discovery of rubber. Whole villages were forced into labour, driven in chain gangs to the rubber camps. Later, another wave of missionaries arrived around the early 1960s. The Brazilian Ye'kuana decided not to live in the missions established on that side of the border, because the missionaries’ attention in Brazil was focused on the Sanumá and not on them. They were also more reluctant to convert, having seen their Venezuelan cousins convert and become (from the Brazilian Ye'kuana perspective) culturally weaker as a result, giving up key elements of their traditional ways of life. On the Venezuelan side of the border, this wave of missionaries brought the establishment of health services, schools, and access to local markets, also creating several relatively large communities centred around the missions.\n\nIn 1980, a married Canadian missionary couple came to live among the Ye’kuana for a while, but they did not like their way of life, and there were disagreements between them and the Ye’kuana, and they left. After this, the Brazilian Ye’kuana decided that they did not want religion, but they did want a school, seeing the benefits that that infrastructure had provided indigenous communities in Venezuela. They got one, after negotiating with the leader of the Evangelical Mission of Amazônas. So began a process of becoming sedentary, wherein the Ye’kuana all moved closer together, and established semi-regular schedules (including that certain times of day for children were set aside for school). This establishment of solid permanent contact also led to more far-reaching mobilisation and contact with other indigenous communities and the state of Roraima. The Ye’kuana became known as skilled canoe makers and manioc scrapers, all while remaining fairly removed from the intense river traffic and influx of outsiders that had harmed many other indigenous communities.\n\nThe Ye’kuana language is situated typologically in the Cariban family, which is subdivided into seven subfamilies and one uncategorised language. Ye’kuana is a member of the Guianan Carib subfamily, along with ten other languages. The Guianan languages are located, for the most part, around the Guiana Shield. Ye’kuana and Wayumara form a smaller category within the Guianan subfamily, the Maquiritari-Wayumara subfamily.\n\nThe first documentations of Ye’kuana in the nineteenth century consist of several wordlists by Schomburgk, followed by several comparative and ethnographic works. The early twentieth century saw more wordlists, moving away from works more generally about the Cariban languages to more specifically focusing on Ye’kuana. Escoriaza (1959 and 1960) provided a grammatical sketch. The 1960s and 70s mostly saw work on the ethnography of the Ye’kuana, including their mythology, political structure, and village formation. Schuster 1976 published a wordlist within his ethnography, but otherwise there was not much linguistic study in that time period. Heinen (1983–1984) published a grammar sketch couched in his mostly ethnographic study; Guss (1986) includes some texts in the language in his publication on oral tradition; and Hall (1988) published two volumes on morphosyntax and discourse analysis. Later, Hall (1991) looked at transitivity in verbs, amid many more ethnographic studies, and Chavier (1999) studied some further aspects of the morphology. A dictionary was published on CD-ROM, and most recently, Natália Cáceres’ MA thesis is a brief overview of the sociolinguistic profile of the Ye'kuana, while her doctoral dissertation presents a more complete descriptive grammar. Coutinho (2013) has also explored the number system of Ye'kuana, from a typological perspective.\n\nAdapted from Cáceres (2011)\n\nAdapted from Cáceres (2011)\n\n/ɨ/ is written <ü> in orthography, and /ə/ is written <ö>, long vowels are indicated by doubling the letter.\n\nYe’kuana’s morphology is comparable to that of other Cariban languages. Ye'kuana makes use of the following major grammatical aspects: past and non-past. The 'past' aspect is subdivided into recent and distant (the much more used of the two) as well as perfective and imperfective. The 'non-past' is used for present, near future, and general truths. As well, probable and definite future aspects are morphologically distinct, there is a distinct imperfective suffix, and the iterative, durative (past), inchoative, terminative aspects are all marked, the latter three being marked periphrastically, rather than with a suffix like the others.\n\nThe first person plural is represented by three forms in Ye'kuana: a dual inclusive form küwü, a dual exclusive form nña, and a plural inclusive form künwanno. There is no plural exclusive form.\n\nThere is an extensive and productive derivation system, including nominalising, verbalising, and adverbialising suffixes. The system of nominalisation allows for adverbs to be converted, for instance \"judume\" ‘black’ becomes \"judum-ato\" ‘that which is black’, \"eetö\" ‘here’ becomes \"eeto-no\" ‘that which is here’, etc; it also has many varieties of verbal nominalisation: intransitivisation, participlisation, agentivisation (\"önöö\" ‘eat (meat)’ becomes \"t-önöö-nei\" ‘eater of meat’), deverbal nominalisation of action, instrumental (\"a’deuwü\" ‘talk’ gives \"w-a’deuwü-tojo\" ‘telephone’), and nominalisation of a participle. In terms of verbalisation, there is the benefactive ‘give N to someone, bring N to something’, such as \"a’deu\" ‘language, word’ becoming \"a’deu-tö\" ‘read, repeat’; its reverse, the privative (\"womü\" ‘clothes’ -> \"i-womü-ka\" ‘undress someone); a general verbalisation suffix \"-ma\"; \"-nö\" which can be used to make transitive verbs; -ta which can be used to make intransitive verbs such as vomit and speak; and the occasional suffixes \"-dö\", \"-wü\", and \"-’ñö\". Finally, the adverbialising suffixes include: nominal possessive, participial, abilitive, a form that indicates the destination of a movement, one indicating aptitude, indicating newness of action, potential, and deverbal negative.\n\nThe probable future aspect is indicated with the suffix \"-tai\", composed of the future marker \"-ta\" and the irrealis marker \"-i\". It does not occur frequently in the elicited data in Cáceres (2011), and it indicates an event for which a probability of its taking place exists, without certainty. The certain future is likewise rarely marked in spontaneous speech. Examples of the probable future given in the grammar include phrases that translate to “you will learn the Ye'kuana language” and “tomorrow it will become red”, contrasted with the certain future examples: “another day I will come and I will see you” (where the second verb is the one marked).\n\nThe language presents several strategies for changing the valency of a verb, primarily a detransitiviser prefix and several causativiser suffixes.\n\nThe base form detransitiviser is postulated to have the form \"öt-\", and has eight allomorphs: \"öt-, ö-, ö’-, ot-, o’-, o-, at-\", and \"a\"-.\nTransitive roots beginning with \"o\", or with \"e\" where the second vowel is [+round] take \"ot-\":\nTransitive roots beginning with \"a\" take \"at-\":\nFor the most part, the patterning of the allomorphs is phonologically-based, however, some roots have slight differences in meaning depending on the allomorph they receive:\n\nAll classes of verb in Ye’kuana can receive a causative suffix, but each of the two types of intransitive verbs (termed U and U) has their own suffix that they take. Intransitive verbs of type U can take the suffixes \"-nüjü\" (with allomorphs \"-mjü\" and \"-nü’\") and \"-nöjü\" (with allomorphs \"-mjü\" and \"-nö’\"), and the result is a transitive verb:\n\nTransitive verbs and intransitive verbs of type U can take the causative suffix \"-jo\". In the case of transitive verbs, another argument is added to the valency of the verb, while intransitives maintain their initial valency. This suffix is used relatively rarely with intransitive verbs, and of all the examples given below begin with /e/, so it is theorised that these verbs take this suffix because they are derived from transitives, however this theory has not been proven.\n\nAll unmarked nouns in Ye’kuana can be understood semantically as singular or “general” in number, while some nouns can receive explicit plural marking that distinguishes them from the singular/general-numbered nouns. Ye’kuana generally uses the suffix \"=komo\" to mark the nominal plural. Cáceres (2011) treats this suffix as a generic plural, while other authors such as Coutinho (2013) subscribe to the analysis given to other Cariban languages that they distinguish in number between the ‘all’ (ie collective) and ‘less-than-the-total’ (ie non-collective), and therefore treats this morpheme as a collective morpheme. After high-front vowel [i] and approximant [j], the palatalised variant \"=chomo\" is also seen. This suffix is used likewise for animate nouns and inanimate nouns:\n\nHowever, there are some restrictions on the distribution of this morpheme, for instance that names of animals cannot take it:\n\nIn the Caura dialect studied by Cáceres (2011), a few other nouns exist that some speakers consider ungrammatical with the plural suffix, but others do not:\n\nHowever, in the Auaris dialect, as examined by Coutinho (2013), the plural forms of these nouns and others were all accepted:\n\nEven in the Auaris dialect, certain nouns denoting fruit do not accept the plural marker:\n\n"}
