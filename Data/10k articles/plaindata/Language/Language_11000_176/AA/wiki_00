Scholars have taken different views of this. Some, such as Heinrich Keil, the 19th century editor of Marius Victorinus, believed that Victorinus published the work of an earlier writer Aphthonius, to which he added an introduction and an appendix on the metres of Horace. The philologist P. Monceaux, however, writing in 1905, suggested that Aphthonius was later than Victorinus, and replaced part of Victorinus's work with his own. A third view is expressed by Bruce (1949), who writes: \"In the present state of uncertainty, the uniformity of style and language seems to justify us in treating the whole of the \"Ars Grammatica\" as the work of Victorinus.\"\n\n\n"}

Arizona\n\nArizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court decision that held that Article III required standing for each stage of litigation, rather than just when a complaint is filed.\n\nIn 1988, ballot initiative Proposition 106, mandating that state employees speak only English on the job passed with 50.5% of the vote. Arizona insurance claims manager Maria-Kelly Yniguez sued to overturn this law because she was concerned that she would be fired for speaking Spanish to claimants. However, on February 6, 1990, judge Paul Rosenblatt of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona ruled that the law violated the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The group Arizonans for Official English appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and on December 7, 1994, that court upheld the Arizona federal court ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted an appeal of the Ninth Circuit ruling on March 26, 1996.\n\nAssociate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for a unanimous court:\n\nFederal courts lack competence to rule definitively on the meaning of state legislation, see, e.g., Reetz v. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82, 86-87, 25 L. Ed. 2d 68, 90 S. Ct. 788 (1970), nor may they adjudicate challenges to state measures absent a showing of actual impact on the challenger, see, e.g., Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 110, 22 L. Ed. 2d 113, 89 S. Ct. 956 (1969). The Ninth Circuit, in the case at hand, lost sight of these limitations. The initiating plaintiff, Maria-Kelly F. Yniguez, sought federal-court resolution of a novel question: the compatibility with the Federal Constitution of a 1988 amendment to Arizona's Constitution declaring English \"the official language of the State of Arizona\"-- \"the language of . . . all government functions and actions.\" Ariz. Const., Art. XXVIII, §§ 1(1), 1(2). Participants in the federal litigation, proceeding without benefit of the views of the Arizona Supreme Court, expressed diverse opinions on the meaning of the amendment. ...\n<br>\nThe Ninth Circuit had no warrant to proceed as it did. The case had lost the essential elements of a justiciable controversy and should not have been retained for adjudication on the merits by the Court of Appeals. We therefore vacate the Ninth Circuit's judgment, and remand the case to that court with directions that the action be dismissed by the District Court. We express no view on the correct interpretation of Article XXVIII or on the measure's constitutionality.\n\nFurthermore, the court ruled Yniguez's complaint moot given that she resigned seven years before this decision.\n\nIn 1999, the Supreme Court declined to hear another appeal by Arizonans for Official English in a case in which the Arizona Supreme Court overturned Proposition 106.\n\nIn 2006, Arizona voters passed Proposition 103 with 74% of the vote, requiring \"all official actions of the government be conducted in English\" with exceptions for certain duties.\n\n"}

{"id": "296116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296116", "title": "Blooper", "text": "Blooper\n\nA blooper is a short clip from a film or video production, usually a deleted scene, containing a mistake made by a member of the cast or crew. It also refers to an error made during a live radio or TV broadcast or news report, usually in terms of misspoken words or technical errors. The term blooper was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s in a series of record albums produced by Kermit Schafer entitled \"Pardon My Blooper\", in which the definition of a blooper is thus given by the record series' narrator: \"Unintended indiscretions before microphone and camera.\"\n\nBloopers are often the subject of television programs and may be shown during the closing credits of comedic films or TV episodes. (Jackie Chan and Burt Reynolds are both famous for including such reels with the closing credits of their movies.) Humorous mistakes made by athletes are often referred to as bloopers as well, particularly in baseball. Prominent examples of films with bloopers include \"Cheaper by the Dozen\" and \"Rush Hour\".\n\nIn recent years, many CGI-animated films have also incorporated bloopers, including a mix of faked bloopers, genuine voice-actor mistakes set to animation, and technical errors. Examples can be found in \"A Bug's Life,\" \"Toy Story 2,\" \"Monsters, Inc.,\" \"Valiant\", some \"Barbie\" films, and the Indian film \"Roadside Romeo\".\n\nThe term \"blooper\" was popularized in America by television producer Kermit Schaefer in the 1950s; the terms \"boner\" (meaning a boneheaded mistake) and \"breakdown\" had been in common usage previously. Schaefer produced a long-running series of \"Pardon My Blooper!\" record albums in the 1950s and 1960s which featured a mixture of actual recordings of errors from television and radio broadcasts and re-creations. Schaefer also transcribed many reported bloopers into a series of books that he published up until his death in 1979.\n\nSchaefer was by no means the first to undertake serious study and collection of broadcast errata; NBC's short-lived \"behind-the-scenes\" series \"Behind The Mike\" (1940–41) occasionally featured reconstructions of announcers' gaffes and flubs as part of the \"Oddities in Radio\" segment, and movie studios had been producing so-called \"gag reels\" of outtakes (usually for employee-only viewing) since the 1930s.\n\nJonathan Hewat was the first person in the UK to broadcast radio bloopers, on a Bank Holiday Show on BBC Radio Bristol at the end of the 1980s.\n\nHe subsequently produced and presented a half-hour show on that station called \"So You Want to Run a Radio Station?\". This was nominated for a Sony Award. The transmission of humorous mistakes, previously considered private material only for the ears of industry insiders, came to the attention of BBC Radio 2. They commissioned a series of six fifteen-minute programmes called \"Can I Take That Again?\", with Jonathan James Moore (then Head of BBC Light Entertainment, Radio) somewhat nervously producing the series. The success of this series led to a further five series on Radio 2, as well as a small number of programmes (called \"Bloopers\") on BBC Radio 4.\n\nCurrently, Jonathan Hewat, who has a personal collection of 3,000 clips from over four decades of worldwide English-speaking broadcasting, feels that with clanger slots, especially on TV, being taken over by Denis Norden and then by Terry Wogan and several others, they are no longer sufficiently unusual to warrant transmitting as complete programmes. As often happens, radio bloopers – involving the subtleties of language – are usually considerably funnier than the visual (TV) ones which so often involve endless clips of people falling over.\n\nSome of the earliest clips in the Hewat collection go back to Rudy Vallee \"corpsing\" (giggling uncontrollably) during a recording of \"There Is a Tavern in the Town\" in one of the very earliest OBs (Outside Broadcasts) of the Illumination of the Fleet.\n\nComedian Dick Emery showcased his own out-takes as an epilogue entitled \"A Comedy of Errors\" to his BBC shows in the mid-1970s. The later ITV show \"It'll Be Alright on the Night\" (originally hosted by Denis Norden) showed out-takes from film and TV. The BBC's answer to the show, \"Auntie's Bloomers\" and its spin-off, \"Auntie's Sporting Bloomers\", ran until 2001. It was replaced by \"Outtake TV\", which began as a series of one-off specials in 2002, hosted by Paul O'Grady, before a series was commissioned for BBC One in 2004, hosted by Anne Robinson. Special \"Weakest Link\" themed editions were common during Robinson's tenure, which lasted until 2009. Rufus Hound took over in 2010. \"Outtake TV\" now appears as occasional one-off specials, much in the same way as \"It'll Be Alright on the Night\".\n\nITV has produced two other shows, \"TV Nightmares\", and \"TV's Naughtiest Blunders\". Both were presented by Steve Penk, before the latter was changed to show continuous clips with voice-over by Neil Morrissey. \"Nightmares\" presented TV personalities relating some of their most hair-raising moments, and \"Naughtiest Blunders\" presented more risqué mistakes. The latter has also been criticised for being used as a simple schedule filler, often with ridiculously titled editions (e.g. \"All New TV's Naughtiest Blunders 18\").\n\nDuring the 1982-83 season, TV producer Dick Clark revived the bloopers concept in America for a series of specials on NBC called \"TV's Censored Bloopers\". This led to a weekly series which ran from 1984 through 1992 (co-hosted by Clark and Ed McMahon) and was followed by more specials that appeared on ABC irregularly until 2004, still hosted by Clark. These specials and a record album of radio bloopers produced by Clark in the mid-1980s were dedicated to the memory of Kermit Schaefer.\n\nAfter Clark suffered a stroke, the blooper shows went on hiatus until 2007, when John O'Hurley hosted a special for ABC that was packaged by Dick Clark Productions.\n\nThe success of both Clark's and Norden's efforts led to imitators on virtually all American and Australian TV networks, as well as scores of home video releases; many American productions are aired to fill gaps in prime time schedules. The ABC Network aired \"Foul-Ups, Bleeps & Blunders\" hosted by Steve Lawrence and Don Rickles in direct competition with the Clark TV series. With the coming of DVD in the 1990s, it became common for major film releases to include a \"blooper reel\" (also known as a \"gag reel\" or simply \"outtakes\") as bonus material on the disc.\n\nIn 1985, Steve Rotfeld began compiling stock footage of various sports-related errors and mistakes and compiled them into a program known as \"Bob Uecker's Wacky World of Sports\". In the early 1990s, that series eventually evolved into \"The Lighter Side of Sports\" and continued in limited production through the early 2000s.\n\nNFL Films, the official production arm of the National Football League, has produced a line of blooper reels known as the Football Follies for both television and direct-to-video consumption since 1968.\n\nBloopers are usually accidental and humorous. Where actors need to memorize large numbers of lines or perform a series of actions in quick succession, mistakes can be expected. Similarly, newsreaders have only a short time to deliver a large amount of information and are prone to mispronounce place names and people's names, or switch a name or word without realizing it, as in a slip-of-the-tongue or Freudian slip.\n\nSome common examples include:\n\nThe famous old chestnut of show business \"Never work with children or animals\" demonstrates two other causes of out-takes: Children, especially those who have no acting experience, often miss cues, deliver the wrong lines or make comments which are particularly embarrassing. Similarly, animals are very likely to do things not in the script, generally involving bodily functions.\n\nA third type of blooper is caused by failure of inanimate objects. This can be as simple as a sound effect being mistimed or a microphone not working properly, but frequently involves doorknobs (and doors) not working or breaking, props and sets being improperly prepared, as well as props working in ways they should not work.\n\nIn recent years, mobile phones have been a new source of bloopers with them frequently going off. Many of them belong to actors, presenters, and contestants who may have forgotten to turn them off or put them in silent mode. The effect is especially pronounced when the film setting is before the modern era (e.g., ancient Greece or Rome). However, this blooper is rarely seen in recent films (most productions enforce 'no cellphone' rules while on-set) but commonly used in fake bloopers for animations.\n\nThe reaction to bloopers is often intensified in the stressful environment of a movie or television set, with some actors expressing extreme annoyance while others enjoy the stress relief brought on by the unexpected event.\n\nOne of the earliest known bloopers is attributed to 1930s radio broadcaster Harry Von Zell, who accidentally referred to then-US President Herbert Hoover as \"Hoobert Heever\" during an introduction. Reportedly it was upon hearing of this mistake that Kermit Schafer was inspired to begin collecting bloopers, although the exact circumstances of the event have been debated. A similar situation occurred decades later when then-new president Gerald Ford was introduced as \"Gerald Smith\", the same name as an American Fascist leader from the 1930s.\n\nOn an episode of \"The Red Skelton Show\" in the 1950s, a skit involving Red's \"country bumpkin\" character \"Clem Kadiddlehopper\", had him leading a cow onto the stage. Several seconds into the skit, the cow defecated on-stage during the live broadcast. Whereupon the audience laughed uncontrollably, and Skelton resorted to the use of the ad-lib, saying \"Boy, she's a great cow! Not only does she give milk, {pause} she gives Pet-Ritz Pies!\" He followed up with, \"Why didn't you think of that earlier?\", \"You have bad breath too!\" and finally, \"Well, it's like in psychiatry... {long pause} Get it out of your system!\" Red then finally broke into laughter, and the network cut to a commercial.\n\nA much-bootlegged recording of Bing Crosby has him singing to a recording of a band playing \"Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams\", when he realizes that the master tape had not been fully rewound, and ad-libbed vocals to the truncated music. He begins, \"Castles may tumble, that's fate after all/ Life's really funny that way.\" Realizing the shortened music, he ad-libs, \"Sang the wrong melody, we'll play it back/ See what it sounds like, hey hey/ They cut out eight bars, the dirty bastards/ And I didn't know which eight bars he was gonna cut/ Why don't somebody tell me these things around here/ Holy Christ, I'm going off my nut\". This recording was first made available to the public by Kermit Schaefer in Volume 1 of his \"Pardon My Blooper\" album series for Jubilee Records in the late 1950s.\n\nOn the \"Wild Bill Hickok\" radio series in the early 1950s, a newsflash caused an unexpected blooper when it broke into the show. With sound effects providing the sound of horses' hoofs galloping and guns firing, Guy Madison spoke the line \"Cut him off at the pass, Jingles!\" Whereupon an announcer interrupted with, \"We interrupt this program to bring you a bulletin from the Mutual newsroom in New York! According to an announcement from Moscow radio, Lavrenti Beria, former head of the Soviet secret police, has just been executed! We now return you to \"Wild Bill Hickok.\"\" At this point, Andy Devine (as Jingles) was delivering the line \"Well, that oughta hold him for a little while, Bill!\"\n\nIn a similar vein, New York children's radio show host \"Uncle Don\" Carney supposedly delivered the ad-libbed line \"Are we off? Good...well, that oughta hold the little bastards\" after signing off on his show one night, thinking his studio microphone was switched off. As a discredited urban legend has it, the remarks went to air, eventually leading to the show's cancellation and \"Uncle Don\"'s disgrace; apparently, Carney himself would tell the story of his blooper, especially once it became popular after the release of Schaefer's records. However, according to the debunking website Snopes.com, not only did the alleged incident never happen, the much distributed recording of the incident was a fabrication. (The alleged incident was even parodied in the 1993 \"Simpsons\" episode \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\".)\n\nAn episode of the radio drama \"Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons\" was presumably introduced as \"Mr. Keen, Loser of Traced Persons.\" (Bob and Ray once did their own parody of this program under the title \"Mr. Trace, Keener Than Most Persons\".)\n\nA popular story among Texas broadcasting circles has it that a station manager's late change in programming from Les Brown's orchestra to a religious programme marking the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur led to the staff announcer's billboard urging his listeners to \"Stay tuned for the dance music of Yom Kippur's Orchestra.\" (Many gentile DJ's have urged their Jewish listeners to \"Have a happy Yom Kippur!\")\n\nA radio commercial for A&P food stores ended with the announcer excitedly blurting out \"...and be sure to visit your nearby A & Food P Store!\" In much the same vein was an ad for instant tea as came out in the end \"Instant White Rose, hot or cold – Orange Tekoe Pee\" and a bakery advertising itself as having \"the breast bed and rolls you ever tasted; I knew that would happen one night, friends,\" all the while breaking out in fits of uncontrollable laughter trying to get the line right.\n\nDuring the Davy Crockett mania of the mid-1950s, a radio ad for children's bedding cashing in on same had the line \". . . with scenes of Davy Crockett in action on the mattress,\" a clear example of how unintentional \"double-entendre\" can translate into blooper material.\n\nAfrikaans news anchor Riaan Cruywagen made several live-bloopers during his long career, most notably: where the normally very composed and highly professional Cruywagen burst into uncontrollable laughter while covering story about a record-breaking frog; as well as when co-anchor Marïetta Kruger asked what the word \"dysentery\" meant while covering a story related to the topic, to which he responded with \"spuitpoep\" (lit translated as \"spray poo\"), which resulted in Kruger going into a fit of uncontrollable laughter.\n\nA public service announcement urging young women to volunteer as nurses during a critical shortage thereof ended with the appeal \"Volunteer to be one of America's white-clapped angels of mercy,\" confusing a slang term for infection with gonorrhea with \"white-clad.\"\n\nThe announcer of a radio ad for the 1948 Bob Hope film \"The Paleface\", which costarred buxom actress Jane Russell, enthusiastically promised: \"Bob Hope, America's favorite comedian, and Jane Russell...what a pair!\"\n\nA Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio announcer's station-identification message once allegedly came out \"This is the Dominion Network of the Canadian Broadcorping Castration,\" in turn coining an oft-used sarcastic term for the public broadcaster. Like other blooper recordings distributed by Schaefer, a recreation was created as the original recording was not preserved, leading to debate over whether the event actually happened.\n\nA radio adaptation of \"Don Quixote\" over the BBC had one episode ending with the announcer explaining where \"I'm afraid we've run out of time, so here we leave Don Quixote, sitting on his ass until tomorrow at the same time.\" In US English, \"ass\" could refer either to the buttocks or to a jackass. However, this would not have been seen as a blooper in the UK in the period when it was transmitted, since the British slang word for buttocks is \"arse\", pronounced quite differently. It is only since it has become permissible for \"ass\" in the sense of \"buttocks\" to be used in US films and on television, and syndicated to the UK, that most Brits have become aware of the \"buttocks\" usage. Indeed, since the King James Bible translation is now rarely used, and since the word \"jackass\" is very rare in the UK, much of British youth is now unaware that \"ass\" can mean \"donkey\". As with the word \"gay\", its usage has completely changed within a few years. The announcer was merely making a joke of the character being frozen in place for 24 hours waiting for us, rather like Elwood in the opening minutes of \"Blues Brothers 2000\", or like toys put back in the cupboard in several children's films.\n\nThe American sitcom \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" had a tradition of airing outtakes over the closing credits, though blooper reels were not shown during the closing credits of the show during the first, fifth (except for one episode) and sixth seasons. Many of these involved malapropisms on the part of the cast, often lampooned by Will Smith, who would chime in on the mistakes made by the rest of the cast. An example of this is when Uncle Phil (James L. Avery, Sr.) comments, \"Well, the silverware's obviously not in the house. It must been stolen\", before realizing the line was \"It must \"have\" been stolen\" and correcting himself. Smith appears in the shot and, in an exaggerated accent, responds, \"It must been stolen. Feet, don't fail me now!\"\n\nAnother sitcom, \"Home Improvement\", also showcased outtakes over its closing credits; however, some episodes featured a tag scene over the credits in lieu of a blooper reel.\n\n\"\" produced many famous out-takes, which were shown to the delight of fans at gatherings over the years and have been extensively bootlegged. One famous example shows actor Leonard Nimoy, who plays the supposedly emotionless Mr. Spock, breaking into laughter when, in the first-season episode \"\", instead of saying the line \"The plants act as a \"repository\"\", says \"The plants act as a \"suppository\"\". In another out-take, series star William Shatner breaks character during a scene and starts complaining about the food served in the studio commissary. A third example begins with the third-season episode \"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\", in which guest actress Diana Muldaur recited the line, \"We've come to the end of an eventful... trip\", to which Shatner replies, \"I don't know what you've been taking...\" – a reference to the then-topical issue of drug-induced hallucinations or \"trips\". People bumping into supposedly automatic doors when the backstage personnel mistimed opening them was a common accident depicted. Similarly there were also mishaps while filming in exterior, with aircraft flying over supposedly alien planets.\n\n\"Hee Haw\" often showed bloopers in the show itself, usually with the actor or actors requiring several tries to get a line right, ending in most cases with the correctly delivered line.\n\nMany theatrical motion pictures feature bloopers during the end credits. For example, many Jackie Chan movies end with footage of failed stunts, blown dialogue, and other mishaps; Chan was inspired to do this by Burt Reynolds' films of the early 1980s (in particular \"Smokey and the Bandit II\" and \"The Cannonball Run\") that also featured end-credits bloopers. As an homage to its inspiration, the closing-credits blooper reel for \"\" actually featured one outtake from \"Smokey and the Bandit II\".\n\nPixar also has a tradition of including blooper-like material during the end credits of such films as \"Toy Story 2\" and \"A Bug's Life\"; the latter was at one point reissued to theatres with a major selling feature being the addition of extra \"bloopers\". Since Pixar's films are painstakingly computer-animated, making actual blunders of this sort is impossible, these scenes are in fact staged to provide additional audience enjoyment. The makers of another computer-animated film, \"\", likewise also created a faux blooper reel showing the characters playing practical jokes and, in one case, bursting into laughter when one \"sneezes\" during a dramatic sequence. However, the movie \"Shrek\" has actual bloopers that were released on DVD. These bloopers are technical errors within the system, causing blurred characters or the characters bodies going through objects, such as a bush or the crown Lord Farquaad wears. Going back decades earlier, in 1939 Warner Bros. cartoon director Bob Clampett produced a short \"blooper\" film (for the studio's annual in-house gag reel) of \"Looney Tunes\" character Porky Pig smashing his thumb with a hammer and cursing.\n\nThe television show, \"Full House\", had various bloopers in television specials but unreleased bloopers were leaked containing cast members using profanity to express their mistakes in a family-friendly program.\n\nThe fishing television series \"Bill Dance Outdoors\" has produced four videos (two VHS and two DVD) focusing entirely on bloopers occurring during production of the show and associated commercials, often showing various mishaps such as missed lines (which sometimes take several takes to finally deliver correctly), accidents during filming (including falling into the water, being impaled with a fish hook, or equipment malfunctions), as well as practical jokes played on the host by his guests and film crew (and vice versa). Some of the outtakes shown on these videos would sometimes be shown over the end credits.\n\nThe Discovery Channel series \"MythBusters\" will often keep some bloopers included in the actual episodes, usually various mishaps that occur on the show, such as minor injuries suffered by the cast, or various other accidents and malfunctions, which are usually quite spectacular and/or embarrassing when they do occur.\n\nIn Asia, variety shows, which is broadcast in a live-like format, would sometimes air bloopers titled \"NG's\", which stands for \"no good\"/\"not good\". These \"NG's\" would usually feature hosts forgetting their words by mistake and admit they make mistakes on occasion.\n\nThe Disney Channel Original Series Sonny with a Chance season 1 episode \"Sonny So Far\" included bloopers where actress Demi Lovato had uncontrollable laughter while suffering from Hiccups during a supposedly \"serious\" scene, and several other scenes where the cast-members either humorously messed-up their lines, or props where forgotten.\n\nA recent example of a well-publicized live blooper occurred during the March 2, 2014 telecast of the 86th Academy Awards. In introducing the singer Idina Menzel's performance of one of the Best Song nominees, actor John Travolta accidentally announced her as \"Adele Dazeem\".\n\nThe proliferation of out-takes/gag reels/blooper reels, especially on recent DVD releases, has received mixed response by actors and directors. While many do not mind the extra publicity offered by such material being shown to the public and others simply enjoy seeing the mistakes, other actors complain that out-takes are demeaning to themselves and/or the craft and refuse to allow them to be made public.\n\nDirector Hal Ashby's decision to include a blooper reel of star Peter Sellers in his 1979 film \"Being There\", for example, is sometimes blamed for Sellers' failure to win that year's Academy Award for Best Actor (for which he was nominated). Sellers had reportedly urged Ashby not to include the outtakes in the final edit of the film, to no avail.\n\nAmong his other issues with \"Star Trek\"'s producer Gene Roddenberry, Leonard Nimoy was not happy that Roddenberry showed the show's blooper reels to fans at conventions in the early 1970s. He felt actors needed to be free to make mistakes without expecting that they would be shown to the public, and wrote a letter to Roddenberry asking him to stop. Roddenberry's answer was to send Nimoy a blooper reel of his own should he have wished to show it at conventions.\n\nThe term \"blooper\" is often applied to describe continuity errors and other mistakes that have escaped the notice of film editors and directors and have made it into a final, televised or released product, where these errors are subsequently identified by viewers. For example, in a film taking place in the Old West, a viewer might spot a twentieth century vehicle driving in the distance of one shot, or in a film taking place in ancient Greece, an actor may have forgotten to remove his wristwatch and it was caught on film. Or it might be a piece of clothing, such as shoes, that change for one shot then change back with no explanation. Strictly speaking, however, these are film errors, and not \"bloopers\" since they did not occur in outtake footage or a live broadcast. The Internet Movie Database website uses the term goofs instead. In the mid-1990s, author Phil Farrand published a series of \"Nit-Picker's Guides\" books in which he collected continuity errors and other on-screen \"bloopers\" from various \"Star Trek\" series that had been identified by either himself or fans.\n\nThe Vietnam-era M79 grenade launcher also has the nickname \"Blooper\" due to its distinctive firing noise. Gustav Hasford refers to this in his novel, \"The Phantom Blooper: A Novel of Vietnam\" (1990).\n\n\n"}

Thus \"Socrates is a philosopher\" consists of \"Socrates\", which signifies the Object \"Socrates\", and \"is a philosopher\", which signifies the Concept of \"being a philosopher\".\n\nThis was a considerable departure from the traditional term logic, in which every proposition (i.e. sentence) consisted of two general terms joined by the copula \"is\".\n\nThe distinction was of fundamental importance to the development of logic and mathematics. Frege's distinction helped to clarify the notions of a set, of the membership relation between element and set, and of empty and infinite sets. However, Frege's conception of a class (in his terminology an extension of a concept) differs from the current iterative conception of a set.\n\nFrege's distinction leads to the famous difficulty or \"awkwardness of language\" that some expressions which purport to signify a concept — Frege's example is \"the concept \"horse\"\" — are grammatically expressions that by his criterion signify an Object. Thus \"the concept \"horse\" is not a concept, whereas the city of Berlin is a city\".\n\nAnthony Kenny sought to justify the distinction, other philosophers such as Hartley Slater and Crispin Wright have argued that the distinguished category of \"entity\" cannot be associated with predication in the way that individual objects are associated with the use of singular terms.\n"}

{"id": "251024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251024", "title": "Downtown", "text": "Downtown\n\nDowntown is a term primarily used in North America by English-speakers to refer to a city's core or central business district (CBD), often in a geographical or commercial sense. The term is not generally used in British English, whose speakers instead use the term city centre.\n\nThe term \"downtown\" is thought to have been coined in New York City, where it was in use by the 1830s to refer to the original town at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan. As the town of New York grew into a city, the only direction it could grow on the island was toward the north, proceeding upriver from the original settlement, the \"up\" and \"down\" terminology coming from the customary map design in which up was north and down was south. Thus, anything north of the original town became known as \"uptown\" (Upper Manhattan), and was generally a residential area, while the original town – which was also New York's only major center of business at the time – became known as \"downtown\" (Lower Manhattan).\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the term was gradually adopted by cities across the United States and Canada to refer to the historical core of the city, which was most often the same as the commercial heart of the city. \"Uptown\" also spread, but to a much lesser extent. In both cases, though, the directionality of both words was lost, so that a Bostonian might refer to going \"downtown\", even though it was north of where they were. Downtown lay to the south in Detroit, but to the north in Cleveland, to the east in St. Louis, and to the west in Pittsburgh. In Boston, a resident pointed out in 1880, downtown was in the center of the city. Uptown was north of downtown in Cincinnati, but south of downtown in New Orleans and San Francisco.\n\nNotably, \"downtown\" was not included in dictionaries as late as the 1880s. But by the early 1900s, \"downtown\" was clearly established as the proper term in American English for a city's central business district, although the word was virtually unknown in Britain and Western Europe, where expressions such as \"city centre\", \"le centre-ville\" (French), \"el centro\" (Spanish), \"o centro\" (Portuguese) and \"das Zentrum\" (German) are used. Even as late as early part of the 20th century, English travel writers felt it necessary to explain to their readers what \"downtown\" meant.\n\nAlthough American downtowns lacked legally-defined boundaries, and were often parts of several of the wards that most cities used as their basic functional district, locating the downtown was not difficult, as it was the place where all the street railways and elevated railways converged, and – at least in most places – where the railroad terminals were. It was the location of the great department stores and hotels, as well as the theatres, clubs, cabarets, and dance halls, and where skyscrapers were built once that technology was perfected. It was also frequently, at first, the only part of a city that was electrified. It was also the place where street congestion was the worst, a problem for which a solution was never really found.\n\nBut most of all, downtown was the place where the city did its business. Inside its small precincts, sometimes as small as several hundred acres, the majority of the trading, selling, and purchasing – retail and wholesale – in the entire area would take place. There were hubs of business in other places around the city and its environs, but the downtown area was the chief one, truly the central business district. And as more and more business was done downtown, those who had their homes there were gradually pushed out, selling their property and moving to quieter residential areas uptown.\n\nThe skyscraper would become the hallmark of the downtown area. Prior to the invention of the elevator – and later the high-speed elevator – buildings were limited in height to about six stories, which was a \"de facto\" limit set by the amount of stairs it was assumed that people would climb, but with the elevator, that limit was shattered, and buildings began to be constructed up to about sixteen stories. What limited them then was the thickness of the masonry needed at the base to hold the weight of the building above it. As the buildings got taller, the thickness of the masonry and the space needed for elevators did not allow for sufficient rentable space to make the building profitable. What shattered that restriction was the invention of first the iron- and then the steel frame building, in which the building's load was carried by an internal metal frame skeleton, which the masonry – and later glass – simply hung off of without carrying any weight.\n\nAlthough first used in Chicago, the steel-framed skyscraper caught on most quickly in New York City in the 1880s, and from there spread to most other American cities in the 1890s and 1900s. The apparent lack of a height limitation of this type of building set off a fervent debate over whether their height should be restricted by law, with proponents and opponents of height limits bringing out numerous arguments in favor of their position. The question of height limits also had a profound implication for the nature of downtown itself: would it continue to be a concentrated core, or as it grew, would height limits force it to spread out into a larger area. In the short run, the proponents of height limits were successful in their efforts. By the 1910s, most of the largest and medium-sized cities had height limits in effect, with New York – despite several concerted efforts to enact them, Philadelphia, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis being notable holdouts.\n\nUltimately, though, it would not be height limits \"per se\" that restricted skyscrapers, but comprehensive zoning laws which would set up separate requirements for different parts of a city, and would regulate not only height, but also a building's volume, the percentage of the lot used, and the amount of light the building blocked, and would also encourage setbacks to reduce a building's bulk by allowing additional height per foot of setback – the exact amount depending on what zone the building was in. New York City was the first to do this, with the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which was prompted in good part by the construction of the Equitable Building in 1915, a 40-story building with straight sides and no setbacks, which raised fears of the downtown area become a maze of dark streets which never saw the sun. What was worse, at least to real estate interests, the building dumped 1.2 million square feet (111,000 m) of office space on what was a sluggish real estate market. To many in the real estate industry, the zoning law was an example of a \"reasonable restriction.\" Once New York had passed its law, other cities followed, although proposed zoning measures did meet stiff resistance in some places, often because of the inclusion of overly restrictive height limits, and sometimes because the entire concept of zoning was seen as undemocratic and bordering on socialism. Eventually, a model law, the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act of 1922 was drawn up for the guidance of cities wishing to enact zoning regulations, which are now part of virtually every American city.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the downtown area was \"the\" business district of the American city, but beginning around the 1920s and 1930s, as cities continued to grow in size and population, rival business districts began to appear outside of downtown in outlying districts. This was the time when the term \"central business district\" began to appear as more-or-less synonymous with the downtown area. The phrase acknowledged the existence of other business districts in the city, but allocated to downtown the primacy of being \"central\", not only geographically, in many cities, but also in importance. And in many cases, the downtown area or central business district, itself began to grow, such as in Manhattan where the business district lower Manhattan and the newer one in midtown began to grow towards each other, or in Chicago, where downtown expanded from the Loop across the Chicago River to Michigan Avenue. In fact, the instability of downtown was a cause for concern for business and real estate interests, as the business district refused to stay where it had been, and shifted its location in response to numerous factors, although it generally stayed fairly compact – in the early 1930s even the largest took up less than 2% of the city's space, and most were significantly smaller – and remained the primary business district of the city.\n\nReal estate interests were particularly concerned about the tendency of downtown to move because the downtown area had by far the highest land values in each city. One commentator said that if Chicago's land values were shown as height on a relief map, the Loop would be equivalent to the peaks of the Himalayas compared to the rest of the city. In 1926, Chicago's central business district, which took up less than 1% of the city, had 20% of the city's land value. The same relationship was true in St. Louis in the mid-20s (20%) and Los Angeles in the early 1930s (17%). So when a downtown area started to shift its location, some property owners were bound to lose a great deal of money, while others would stand to gain.\n\nOne way in which downtown changed from the late 19th century to the early part of the 20th century was that industrial concerns began to leave downtown and move to the periphery of the city, which meant that downtown's businesses were chiefly part of the burgeoning service sector. Brand new firms followed the older ones, and never came to downtown, settling at the edges of the city or the urban area. Industrial districts developed in these areas, which were sometimes specifically zoned for manufacturing. There, land was considerably cheaper than downtown, property taxes were lower, transportation of supplies and finished products was much easier without the constant congestion emblematic of downtown, and with the improvement of the telephone system, the industrial firms could still keep in touch with the companies they did business with elsewhere. As a result of this migration, manufacturing was no longer a significant part of the downtown mix of businesses.\n\nAnother sector which began to move away from downtown even before the turn of the 20th century were the great cultural institutions: museums, symphony halls, main libraries and so on. Not only was the high cost of land downtown a factor, but these institutions wanted larger plots of land than were available there, so that their buildings could themselves be easily perceived as works of art. Organizations such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New-York Historical Society, the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of the City of New York, all in Manhattan, moved out of downtown, as did the Museum of Fine Arts, the Boston Public Library, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Detroit Public Library and the Detroit Institute of Art, and most of the cultural institutions in Pittsburgh. Public reaction to these moves was mixed, with some bemoaning the loss of a counterbalance to the overall materialism of downtown, while others, particularly those involved in real estate, looked positively on the availability of the land which the cultural institutions left behind.\n\nThe loss of the major cultural institutions left downtown as a place primarily dedicated to business, but the loss of another sector, retail shopping, defined the \"type\" of business that was done there. The great retail outlets like the department stores had always had the tendency to move closer to the residential districts, to make it easier for their customers to get to them, but after 1920 they started to congregate in secondary business districts on the periphery of the city. The growth of chain stores such as J. C. Penney, F. W. Woolworth, Kresge and W. T. Grant, contributed to the increased importance of the outlying shopping districts, which began outselling those retail stores which had remained in the central business district, and provoked those stores to open branches in the secondary districts in attempt to go to where there customers were instead of having them come downtown to them.\n\nEntertainment venues also contributed to the decentralization of commerce which affected the importance and influence of downtown and the central business district. Theaters, vaudeville houses, dance halls and night clubs had been primarily located in downtown, with nickelodeons spread throughout the city. When film became the dominant medium, and exhibitors started to build movie theaters to show them in, they at first built those venues downtown as well, but, as in retail shopping, chain exhibitors such as Loews began to construct them in locations convenient to the mass audience they were seeking; again, it was a matter of bringing their product to where the people were. By the late 1920s, movie houses outside of downtown far outnumbered those in the central district. Not all the movie theaters in the periphery were palaces, but some were, and the net effect was that downtown was no longer the entertainment center of the city.\n\nWith the loss of manufacturing, the major cultural institutions, much of the retail shopping in the city, and its loss of status as the entertainment center, the nature of downtown had changed considerably. It was still the location of banks, stocks and commodity exchanges, law and accounting firms, the headquarters of the major industrial concerns and public utilities, insurance companies, and advertising agencies, and in its confines continued to be built new and taller skyscrapers housing offices, hotels and even department stores, but it was still steadily losing ground as decentralization took its toll. Its daytime population was not keeping pace with the population growth of the city around it, and property values, while continuing to rise, were not rising as fast as those in the secondary business districts. Downtown was still the central business district, and was still the most important area for doing business and commerce, but it was no longer as dominant as it once was.\n\nThe causes of decentralization, which decreased the importance of downtown in the life of American cities, has been ascribed to many factors, including each city's normal growth patterns; advances in technology like the telephone, which made it easier for business-to-business intercourse to take place over a distance, thus lessening the need for a centralized commercial core; the rise of the private automobile, which allowed shoppers to go to peripheral business districts more easily; a strong increase in streetcar fares; and the continuing problem of congestion in the narrow streets of the downtown area.\n\nAs much as people disagreed about what caused decentralization, they were even less in agreement about how decentralization would affect the central business district, with opinions varying all the way from the belief that it would diminish downtown sufficiently that it would eventually consist of only offices and the headquarters of corporate giants, to the belief that decentralization would lead to the (perhaps deserved) death of downtown entirely as unnecessary, a victim on its untameable traffic congestion. In between were those who saw a diminishment of the area's influence, but not sufficiently enough to prevent it from remaining the \"Sun\" that the outlying business districts revolved around. Others doubted whether decentralization had as strong an impact as it was credited with. Positions were taken that downtown was a natural part of the evolution of a city, or the unnatural result of a \"de facto\" conspiracy by merchants and property owners, so the question of what decentralization would do to downtown became bound up with the question about the area's legitimacy.\n\nDecentralization also increased the incidences of rivalry between downtown and burgeoning business districts. In Los Angeles, for instance, downtown and Wilshire Boulevard battled for dominance, and in Cincinnati the rivalry was between the old downtown centered around Fountain Square and the one on Canal Street. The diminishment of downtown by decentralization caused these battles to be between areas that were now more relatively equal.\n\nLike almost every other aspect of American life, the Great Depression had a major effect on the country's downtown area. Downtown was just coming off a major building boom, in which significant amounts of new commercial and office space, hotels, and department stores had been built. By 1931 there were 89 buildings of 30 stories or more in Manhattan, and between 1925 and 1931, office space nearly doubled; in Chicago, it increased by almost 75%, in Philadelphia by almost two-thirds, and by more than 50% in New Orleans and Denver. In the 1920s, 500,000 additional hotel rooms were built in New York, and from 1927 to 1931 there were 84 large hotels built there, an increase of hotel space by two-thirds.\n\nWhen the boom was over, and the Depression had begun to have its effect, much of this new space became unneeded excess. Owners of smaller buildings who could not keep a sufficient number of tenants to pay their overhead, tore down their buildings, but wheras in the recent past they would have been replaced with taller buildings, now they became one- and two-story parking garages or ground-level parking lots. These were widely known as \"taxpayers\", as they generated enough revenue for the owner of the lot to pay the taxes on it. Rents fell, sometimes as much as 30%, and non-payment of rent increased. Even with the \"taxpayers\" taking away commercial space, vacancy rates rose precipitously. Owners went into default, and downtown real estate lost considerable value: 25–30% in the Chicago Loop – although values in other parts of the city, including the outlying business districts, fared even worse.\n\nDepartment stores were hit hard; most managed to keep their doors open, but few made money. Hotels which needed to have large staffs, and required high occupancy rates to make a profit were also deeply affected; in Manhattan the hotel occupancy rate fell from 1929's 70% to around 50% in 1933. Room rates were slashed, revenue dropped, and many hotels closed or defaulted. By 1934, 80% of hotels in Manhattan were owned by their creditors.\n\nThe slow recovery from the effects of the Great Depression began in the mid-1930s, decelerated at the end of the 1930s, and picked up speed with the start of World War II, so that by the early 1940s the country was for the most part out of the Depression. Excess commercial space began to be used, vacancy rates dropped, department store sales rose, hotel occupancy rates went up, and revenues increased.\n\nDespite this recovery, the daytime population of the country's downtowns did not rebound. For instance, in Chicago between 1929 and 1949, the population of the city grew 7%, and that of the entire metropolitan area by about 14%, but the daytime population of The Loop only rose 1/3 of 1%. With a few exceptions, such as New York City, this pattern was typical across American cities, and was tied to the slowing down of the rate of growth of the cities themselves. Cities in the US grew much more slowly than during any other period in the history of the country, and some even lost population. Metropolitan regions grew faster than the cities inside them, indicating the start of the decades of urban sprawl, but they too grew at a slower pace than usual. Downtowns also had less daytime population because people now went to the outlying business districts, which were closer to their homes by car, for their shopping and entertainment, to do business, and to work. The increased use of automobiles over mass transit also damaged downtown, since the streetcar lines converged on downtown, while the roads went everywhere. All of these factors contributed to the lesser recovery of downtown relative to the city as a whole and the metropolitan area.\n\nAnother sign that downtowns were no longer as central to city life as they once were include the decreased portion of retail trade that took place there as compared to the peripheral business areas, which profited by the growth of the chain stores, to the detriment of the big downtown department stores Furthermore, the \"taxpayers\", which many people had expected to disappear once the economy improved, remained in place, and even increased in number. In the Loop in Chicago, by the early 1940s, 18% of the land was vacant or was used for parking; in Los Angeles at the same timethe figure was 25%. Demand for commercial space was so light that it did not make financial sense to construct expensive new buildings, and banks began to refuse to make loans for that purpose, redlining whole neighborhoods in the central business bistrict.\n\nThe typical American downtown has certain unique characteristics. During the postwar economic boom in the 1950s, the residential population of most downtowns crashed. This has been attributed to reasons such as slum clearance, construction of the Interstate Highway System, and white flight from urban cores to rapidly expanding suburbs. Due to well-intended but ineptly executed urban revitalization projects, downtowns eventually came to be dominated by high-rise office buildings in which commuters from the suburbs filled white-collar jobs, while the remaining residential populations sank further into unemployment, poverty, and homelessness. By the 1990s, many office-oriented businesses began to abandon the tired old downtowns for the suburbs, resulting in what are now known as \"edge cities\". One textbook, in explaining why edge cities are so popular, stated:\n\nSince then, between 2000 and 2010, downtown areas grew rapidly in population. In U.S. metro areas with at least five million people, the population within two miles of the city hall grew twice as fast as the overall population in the metro area.\n\nThe terms \"downtown\" and \"uptown\" can refer to cardinal directions, for example, in Manhattan, where \"downtown\" is also a relative geographical term. Anything south of where the speaker is currently standing, in most places, is said to be \"downtown\". Anything north of the speaker is \"uptown\". In the common New York City phrase \"We're going to take the subway downtown\", \"downtown\" refers to traveling in the geographic direction of south. A person standing on 121st Street and walking ten blocks south could also be said to have walked ten blocks downtown. The term \"uptown\" is used to refer to the cardinal direction north. Such concepts derive from Manhattan's elongated shape, running roughly north/south and nowhere more than wide. As such, transportation on the island travels in the uptown/downtown directions. The other boroughs are wider, and \"downtown\" there refers to Lower Manhattan, Downtown Brooklyn, or some more local business district. Mercantile efforts to promote the South Bronx as \"Downtown Bronx\" have met with little success.\n\nIn some North American cities, \"downtown\" is the formal name of the neighborhood in which the city's central business district is located. Most major North American cities are located on major bodies of water, like oceans, lakes, and rivers. As cities expanded, people built further away from the water and their historical cores, often uphill. Thus the central business district of a North American city, or the historical core of the city, is often located \"down\", in altitude, relative to the remainder of the city. Many cities use the Manhattan model and continue to use \"downtown\", \"midtown\", and \"uptown\" both as informal relative geographical terms and as formal names for distinct districts. However, the city of Philadelphia uses the designation Center City, not downtown, due to the business district's central location, as well as Philadelphia's age and circumstances; \"Center City\" corresponds to the City of Philadelphia prior to its amalgamation with Philadelphia County in 1854, leaving it without a unique name, unlike the former boroughs surrounding it; the center of the city is also where Philadelphia City Hall is located within the city's original plat. New Orleans uses the term Central Business District (or CBD) for their downtown due to the historical French Quarter district taking up what would usually be considered the city's historical downtown district, and another area of the city south of the CBD being referred to as \"downtown\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

The language is moribund. Around 10 fluent speakers are left; the overall number of potential speakers is less than 40 individuals. All speakers are found in the generation of 50 years and older. Recent local statistics indicate that there are around 260 individuals of ethnic Enets origin. Enets belongs to the Northern branch of the Samoyedic languages, in turn a branch of the Uralic language family.\n\nThere are two distinct dialects, Forest (Bai) Enets and Tundra (Madu or Somatu) Enets, which may be considered separate languages.\n\nForest Enets is the smaller of the two Enets dialects. In the winter of 2006/2007, approximately 35 people spoke it (6 in Dudinka, 20 in Potapova and 10 in Tukhard, the youngest of whom was born in 1962 and the oldest in 1945). Many of these speakers are trilingual, with competence in Forest Enets, Tundra Nenets and Russian, preferring to speak Tundra Nenets.\n\nThe two dialects differ both in phonology and in lexicon. Additional variation was found in early Enets records from the 17th to 19th centuries, though all these varieties can be assigned as either Tundra Enets or Forest Enets.\n\nPhonological differences:\n\nLexical differences:\n\nEnets is written using the Cyrillic alphabet, though it includes the letters \"ԑ\", \"ӈ\", and \"ҫ\" which are not used in the Russian alphabet.\nThe written form of the Enets language was created during the 1980s and has been used to produce a number of books. During the 1990s there was an Enets newspaper, Советский Таймыр (Soviet Taimyr) published and brief Enets broadcasts on local radio, which shut down in 2003, served as supplements for speakers.\n\nThe syntax of Enets is typical for the family and the area. The Enets language follows SOV, head marking in the noun phrase, both head and dependent marking within the clause, non-finite verbal forms used for clause combining.\n\nEnets nouns vary for number, case, and person-number of the possessor. There is also an intriguing nominal case in which ‘destinativity’ determines the entity is destined for someone. Possessor markers are also used for discourse related purposes, where they are completely devoid of the literal possessive meaning. Enets postpositions are marked for person-number; many postpositions are formed from a small set of relational nouns and case morphology.\n\nThe following phonemes are combined from all of the different dialects of the Enets languages; Enets (Künnap 1999), Forest Enets (Siegl 2013), Tundra Enets (Nikolaeva 2014).\n\n\n\n"}

Family friendly restaurants are ones that provide service to families that have young children.\n\nIn censorship debates, the term means cultural works (including art, literature, films, television and music) that are considered by most people to be generally appropriate for children while at the same time palatable to adults. Frequently, the term \"Think of the children\" is used during a moral panic to censor new forms of media. Often, depiction of nudity, sex, horror, profanity, racial slurs, innuendo, drug use, blasphemy, and racism are declared to be worthy of censorship. Many parents disagree over the ages at which children should be exposed to certain forms of media. The precise definition of \"family friendly\" can vary depending upon the perceived acceptability of content for children — one of the most challenged books in United States libraries is \"Captain Underpants\", a book that contains toilet humor that parents read out to children. Frequently parents that complain about media that contains profanity attempt to deny other families the ability to choose what is appropriate for their children. The values of the individual family, such as their belief in religion, can also affect whether the family perceives a product as family-friendly.\n\nBoth the MPAA film rating system and most television content rating systems have ratings for family-friendliness: a G rating in either is universally acceptable for all audiences, while a PG rating suggests that, while generally safe for children to watch, that there should be a parent or guardian present for guidance, since some mild adult-oriented material may be present. The MPAA's film rating system has not been without controversy (itself established after the Hays Code, which required all films to be at least somewhat family-friendly, was abolished), as theater chain interest groups have noted that films rated as high as R (adult-oriented films that persons under 17 cannot watch without an adult) could be interpreted as being family-friendly if the viewer is tolerant of profanity, while others may have far too much graphic violence or borderline-pornographic sexual images to be suitable for children. The North American Entertainment Software Rating Board, which rates video games, classifies family-friendly content with an E rating.\n\nFrequently, family friendly products avoid marketing solely to children and attempt to make the product palatable to adults as well. Some examples of companies who promote products intended to be family-friendly include INSP, Hallmark, Discovery Family, Me-TV Network, Antenna TV, Light TV, Cozi TV, The Walt Disney Company, Mojang, Nickelodeon, Boomerang, Three Angels Broadcasting Network, Hope Channel, Trinity Broadcasting Network, Nintendo, Litton Entertainment, Pixar, Sullivan Bluth Studios, Golden Films, Activision Blizzard Studios, and Sierra Entertainment.\n\nIn politics, new workplace legislation may be introduced to strengthen the family unit through giving parents more flexible family-friendly working hours or educational reforms to helping children with special needs and to give parents more choice in how they are schooled.\n\nThe concept of family-friendliness within the tourism sector is constantly evolving. Hotels concentrate new services towards family-friendliness in a narrower concept such as child- (kids stay and eat free) and pet-friendliness (pet friendly hotel chains) within the overall family-friendliness customer oriented concept.\n\nThe American Library Association maintains a list of the most challenged books, which are frequently claimed to be inappropriate for children. They stated in a release by the National Coalition Against Censorship that \"This year's #1 banned book, Captain Underpants... is the gift that keeps on giving. Why? Because these popular, silly books are read by parents, with their children, all over the country. The potty humor makes parents roll their eyes and kids giggle. The absurdity of banning books in order to attack perceived moral problems is exemplified by this year's winner.\n\nAn overwhelming theme of television in the 1990s was the trend of the family sitcom. This trend became enormously popular in the 90’s with shows such as \"Full House\", \"Boy Meets World\", \"Family Matters\", \"Home Improvement\", \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", and \"Step by Step\". During their prime, these shows were some of the hottest sitcoms on TV.\n\nA family-friendly (or all-ages) show, event or venue refers to one with no age restrictions for entry. In the United States, as applied to the world of concerts, this can refer to a show or venue where minors are permitted to attend a live performance, since those who are not of legal drinking age are generally not permitted in bars, but are permitted in restaurants which serve alcoholic beverages. In some cases the pop-up retail model is applied, as with the pop-up venues at the Treefort Music Fest.\n\nMore ideologically, following the trends of punk rock and embracing to an extent the opposition to drugs and alcohol inherent in the Straight-edge movement, All Ages shows have either no alcohol sales whatsoever, or sales are restricted through a system of wristbands or for patrons legally prohibited from consuming alcohol, generally as a large, black, \"X\" on the back of each hand. This symbol has been featured on many punk album covers, and the attendant term, \"All Ages,\" was used as the title of a compilation album by North American punk icons Bad Religion. The term in this context does not denote a restriction on the thematic or lyrical content of the music.\n\n"}

{"id": "251277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251277", "title": "Grelling–Nelson paradox", "text": "Grelling–Nelson paradox\n\nThe Grelling–Nelson paradox is an antinomy, or a semantic self-referential paradox, concerning the applicability to itself of the word \"heterological\", meaning \"inapplicable to itself\". It was formulated in 1908 by Kurt Grelling and Leonard Nelson, and is sometimes mistakenly attributed to the German philosopher and mathematician Hermann Weyl.\nIt is thus occasionally called Weyl's paradox and Grelling's paradox. It is closely related to several other well-known paradoxes, in particular, the barber paradox and Russell's paradox.\n\nSuppose one interprets the adjectives \"autological\" and \"heterological\" as follows:\n\nAll adjectives, it would seem, must be either autological or heterological, for each adjective either describes itself, or it doesn't. Problems arise in a number of instances, however.\n\nThe Grelling–Nelson paradox arises when we consider the adjective \"heterological\". One can ask: Is \"heterological\" a heterological word?\nIf the answer is \"no\", then \"heterological\" is autological. This leads to a contradiction, for in this case \"heterological\" does not describe itself: it must be a heterological word.\nBut if the answer is \"yes\", then \"heterological\" is heterological. This again leads to a contradiction, because if the word \"heterological\" describes itself, it is autological.\n\n\nThe paradox can be eliminated, without changing the meaning of \"heterological\" where it was previously well-defined, by modifying the definition of \"heterological\" slightly to hold all nonautological words except \"heterological\". But \"nonautological\" is subject to the same paradox, for which this evasion is not applicable because the rules of English uniquely determine its meaning from that of \"autological\". A similar slight modification to the definition of \"autological\" (such as declaring it false of \"nonautological\" and its synonyms) might seem to correct that, but the paradox still obtains for synonyms of \"autological\" and \"heterological\" such as \"selfdescriptive\" and \"nonselfdescriptive\", whose meanings also would need adjusting, and the consequences of those adjustments would then need to be pursued, and so on. Freeing English of the Grelling–Nelson paradox entails considerably more modification to the language than mere refinements of the definitions of \"autological\" and \"heterological\", which need not even be in the language for the paradox to arise. The scope of these obstacles for English is comparable to that of Russell's paradox for mathematics founded on sets.\n\nOne may also ask whether \"autological\" is autological.\nIt can be chosen consistently to be either:\n\nThis is the opposite of the situation for heterological: while \"heterological\" logically cannot be autological or heterological, \"autological\" can be either. (It cannot be both, as the category of autological and heterological cannot overlap.)\n\nIn logical terms, the situation for \"autological\" is:\nwhile the situation for \"heterological\" is:\n\nOne may also ask whether \"loud\" is autological or heterological. If said loudly, \"loud\" is autological; otherwise, it is heterological. This shows that some adjectives cannot be unambiguously classified as autological or heterological. Newhard sought to eliminate this problem by taking Grelling's Paradox to deal specifically with word types as opposed to word tokens.\n\nThe Grelling–Nelson paradox can be translated into Bertrand Russell's famous paradox in the following way. First, one must identify each adjective with the set of objects to which that adjective applies. So, for example, the adjective \"red\" is equated with the set of all red objects. In this way, the adjective \"pronounceable\" is equated with the set of all pronounceable things, one of which is the word \"pronounceable\" itself. Thus, an autological word is understood as a set, \"one of whose elements is the set itself\". The question of whether the word \"heterological\" is heterological becomes the question of whether the set of all sets not containing themselves contains itself as an element.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14067", "title": "Hendrick Avercamp", "text": "Hendrick Avercamp\n\nHendrick Avercamp (January 27, 1585 (bapt.) – May 15, 1634 (buried)) was a Dutch painter. Avercamp was born in Amsterdam, where he studied with the Danish-born portrait painter Pieter Isaacks (1569–1625), and perhaps also with David Vinckboons. In 1608 he moved from Amsterdam to Kampen in the province of Overijssel. Avercamp was deaf and mute and was known as \"de Stomme van Kampen\" (the mute of Kampen).\n\nAs one of the first landscape painters of the 17th-century Dutch school, he specialized in painting the Netherlands in winter. Avercamp's paintings are colorful and lively, with carefully crafted images of the people in the landscape. Many of Avercamp's paintings feature people ice skating on frozen lakes.\n\nAvercamp's work enjoyed great popularity and he sold his drawings, many of which were tinted with water-color, as finished pictures to be pasted into the albums of collectors. The Royal Collection has an outstanding collection of his works.\n\nAvercamp died in Kampen and was interred there in the Sint Nicolaaskerk.\n\nAvercamp probably painted in his studio on the basis of sketches he had made in the winter.\nAvercamp is famous even abroad for his winter landscapes. The passion for painting skating characters probably came from his childhood: he was practicing this hobby with his parents. The last quarter of the 16th century, during which Avercamp was born, was one of the coldest periods of the Little Ice Age.\n\nThe Flemish painting tradition is mainly expressed in Avercamp's early work. This is consistent with the landscapes of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Avercamp painted landscapes with a high horizon and many figures who are working on something. The paintings are narrative, with many anecdotes. For instance, naughty details are included in the painting \"Winter landscape with skaters\": a couple making love, buttocks and a peeing male. \n\nLater in his life drawing the atmosphere was also important in his work. The horizon also gradually dropped down under more and more air.\n\nAvercamp used the painting technique of aerial perspective. The depth is suggested by change of color in the distance. To the front objects are painted, such as trees or a boat. This technique strengthens the impression of depth in the painting.\n\nAvercamp has also painted cattle and seascapes.\n\nSometimes Avercamp used paper frames, which were a cheap alternative to oil paintings. He first drew with pen and ink. This work was then covered with finishing paint. The contours of the drawing remained. Even with this technique Avercamp could show the pale wintry colors and nuances of the ice .\n\nAvercamp produced about a hundred paintings. The bulk of his artwork can be seen in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Mauritshuis in The Hague and abroad. \nFrom November 20, 2009 to February 15, 2010 the Rijksmuseum presented an exhibition of his work entitled \"Little Ice Age\".\n\n"}

Shane is director of the Autism Language Program and Communication Enhancement Program at Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, former director of the Institute on Applied Technology, and associate professor at Harvard Medical School. He is internationally known for his research and development of augmented and alternative communication systems to support the communication needs of people with neuromuscular disorders, autism and other disabilities.\n\nShane graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1969 with a B.A. in sociology. He went on to earn an M.A. in speech pathology and audiology in 1972 (also from the University of Massachusetts) and a PhD in speech pathology in 1975 from Syracuse University. He completed a doctoral fellowship in 1975 at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nShane began his career as an assistant professor of communication sciences at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont (1975–1977). He served as associate professor at Emerson College, Department of Communication Studies, (1977–1995), and visiting associate professor for the University of Massachusetts (1985–1990). Shane was an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School's Department of Otology and Laryngology (1986–1995) before becoming an associate professor (1996–present). Shane is also a professor of communication science and disorders at MGH Institute of Health Professions (1997–present). In 1977, Shane was appointed associate scientist of otolaryngology at Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nAlso in 1977, Shane was appointed the director of speech pathology and audiology at the Developmental Evaluation Clinic at Children's Hospital Boston. and held that position until 1991. In 1985, he was appointed director of the Communication Enhancement Center (CED), the augmentative communication program, at Boston Children's Hospital. In 2005, he assumed leadership of the Center for Communication Enhancement (which encompassed the old CEC and five other programs), a role he continues to hold .\n\nFor his lifetime achievements at Boston Children's Hospital, Shane was awarded the Center for Communication Enhancement's inaugural Directorship Chair in 2015. The endowed Chair, which will be named for him in future, is funded by the Boston Children's Hospital Otolaryngologic Foundation.\n\nShane has spent much of his career researching and developing assistive technologies that support children and adults, including Stephen Hawking, whose ability to communicate in spoken or written language forms is \"limited by autism, cerebral palsy, language disorders, spinal cord injuries, or neuromuscular diseases.\" The systems have become so refined that a person does not need dexterity to activate a computer on their own and select letters, words or pre-programmed phrases from a screen. Small muscle movements suffice. Finger twitches, head nods and eye blinks, as well as the spoken voice for those with that ability, are all that is required for individuals to communicate independently.\n\nIn 1983, Shane directed a program through his Institute on Technology to create technology solutions for students at Boston College. Other team members included Allen Field from Boston Children's Hospital , Katharyn Dawson, a speech and language pathologist, and Don Ricciato, principal of the school. The team was dedicated to designing and implementing teaching tools to assist people who were unable to speak in their efforts to communicate. The school worked with students whose ages ranged from 10 to 25 and who exhibited a wide range of neurological, physical and intellectual challenges.\n\nThis collaboration led to the creation of Touch 'N Speak, a software program that allowed students to use movement (i.e., of an elbow or head), to activate touch-sensitivity keyboards to access pre-programmed messages and activate a vocal mechanism. This also marked the first time that a computer (an Apple IIe) was successfully mounted on a wheelchair. Ground-breaking at the time, this was one of the first innovations in the field of \"augmentative communication,\" recognized as a valid form of communication by the American Speech–Language–Hearing Association in 1981.\n\nIn 1989, Shane consulted with the programmers of Microsystems Software Inc., a company owned by Richard and Deborah Gorgens to develop software packages to assist people with disabilities in their efforts to participate in the workplace. The result was HandiWare, a collection of computer programs that ran on IBM-compatible PCs and sought to assist people with \"physical impairments, visual impairments and those individuals requiring computer-aided speech.\" HandiChat, targeted for people with speech impairments, allowed individuals to type on a keyboard and have their words spoken through a DECtalk speech synthesizer. HandiWord, a \"word prediction program\", was responsive to individuals' most frequently used words and finished spelling out words based on the first few letters. At the time these programs were being introduced, the Americans with Disabilities Act was newly enacted. Communication technologies like HandiWare enabled individuals who had not worked in 10–15 years because of their communication difficulties return to and become productive members of the work place.\n\nIn 1995, a computer-generated play world called \"Starbright World\" was made available to the children's hospital, as well as other hospitals in New York, Pittsburgh and California, that allowed patients to connect through cyberspace. \"Starbright World\", an interactive network financed by Steven Spielberg, was intended to help patients with serious and chronic illnesses escape in the world of play and, if desired, connect with others facing the same kind of diagnosis and treatment. Initially, access to \"Starbright World\" relied on a child's ability to use a mouse or type on a keyboard. Shane and his team worked to find alternate navigation techniques for children whose motor skills were impaired or for those who did not yet have the required computer skills.\n\nIn 2002, the Monarch School for Autism, in Shaker Heights, Ohio, began a collaboration with Boston Children's Hospital, and MGH Institute of Health Professionals to support children with autism in their use of communication and development of life skills. The Monarch School for Autism, an intensive one-one-one, language-enrichment program, was the first of its kind in Ohio, serving only children with autism whose needs are often under-served in the public school system. At the time, Shane had more than 30 years experience assisting people with autism and, as a result, had developed computer software specifically designed to \"boost verbal communication skills\" using visual information. The focus of the collaboration, headed by Shane, was to develop a curriculum using the software and other complimentary technologies reliant on visual cuing that could serve as a model for educational programs throughout the U.S.\n\nShane led a team to develop the Visual Immersion System (VIS), a visual curriculum to support the communication needs of people with disabilities. The curriculum makes use of communication technology, including the iPad, which allows people with autism to engage in visual activities that aid in the development of language skills. The effectiveness of the program is currently under study, with clinical evidence \"still emerging,\" but, as Shane states, \"the excitement and interest in these technologies exist because they are working.\"\n\nFacilitated Communication (FC), popularized in the early 1990s in the United States by Douglas Biklen, is an alleged communication technique in which the facilitator (usually a parent, educator, or caregiver) holds the hand, shoulder or arm of a person with disabilities in order to type on a paper letter board or mechanical keyboard.\n\nShane first learned of FC in Sweden, when he attended an International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ISAAC) conference where Rosemary Crossley gave a speech.. He questioned claims from promoters that individuals with severe disabilities, some as young as 5 or 6 years old, without formal training in reading or written language could produce messages that included \"perfectly spelled sentences\" and whether or not the communications were originating from the children or the adult facilitators. On the 1993 \"Frontline\" show, \"Prisoners of Silence,\" produced by Jon Palfreman, Shane questioned the sophistication of the sentences being typed using FC. Students, with the help of facilitators, were typing out grammatically correct and accurately spelled sentences that, according to Shane, held \"insights that go far beyond their years.\" Proponents maintained that these children learned language and written language skills by being \"immersed in language-rich environments.\"\n\nAlready versed in communications technology that allowed people with autism and a wide range of physical disabilities to communicate independently and without someone else's touch, Shane criticized FC as \"bogus nonsense\" and \"a complete waste of time.\"\n\nShane became involved with FC further when he was called as an expert witness in a court case. The parents were accused of sexual abuse through a facilitator using FC with their autistic child. Shane established simple double-blind protocols to test the validity of the message and determine authorship of the messages. The results indicated that not only was the child incapable of typing out the messages, the content produced was based on facilitator's knowledge of the materials presented. In his book, \"Facilitated Communication: The Clinical and Social Phenomenon\", Shane outlines a \"wide range of tasks and procedures,\" that practitioners can use to establish the source of the facilitated messages. Since that first court case, Shane has continued to serve as an expert witness with the results, to date, always the same. Rather than support people with autism in their efforts to communication, FC, according to Shane is \"hurtful and harmful\" and deprives \"children of their right to independently communicate.\"\n\nShane believes that FC messages originate from facilitators who \"subconsciously guide the hands and fingers of people they are assigned to help.\" via the ideomotor phenomenon. With regard to the ideomotor phenomenon and FC, the facilitators become so absorbed in the typing process, they are unaware of their own movements while holding onto their disabled communication partner. Shane stated on \"Prisoners of Silence\": You can't be a one-finger typist and not look at the keyboard. You just can't get oriented. You don't have a home position. And when you watch children who are F/C – facilitated communication – users, they may not be looking at the language board, but the facilitators are not taking their eyes off it. They're fixed on it.\n\nCritics of Shane's stance on FC claim that testing is unfair to the person with disabilities who, they claim, might exhibit test anxiety or \"freeze in their ability to respond.\"\n\nDonald P. Oswald, who reviewed \"The Facilitated Communication: Clinical and Social Phemenon\", praised the book for its \"valuable perspectives on the FC story,\" citing chapters written by Jon Palfreman, Gina Green, Wolf Wolfensberger, Barry Prizant, and Shane that provide a \"preliminary retrospective of the FC fad in the United States,\" but criticized the book for its sometimes \"dispassionate discourse.\" He wrote: The authors in this work occasionally reveal the personal distress they have experienced and as a result, at times the tone of their writing is defensive or aggressive. Nonetheless, this book offers valuable perspectives on the FC story and, depending on the reader's personal position, will stimulate, enlighten and, at times, enrage.\n\nSupporters of FC state that often people start out using a facilitator and eventually learn to type without physical support. Shane responded by saying '\"If someone’s going to be a typist, they don’t need somebody to facilitate them.\"'\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is NETtalk's task to learn proper associations between the correct pronunciation with a given sequence of letters based on the context in which the letters appear. In other words, NETtalk learns to use the letters around the currently pronounced phoneme that provide cues as to its intended phonemic mapping.\n\n"}

{"id": "1155876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1155876", "title": "Old Nubian language", "text": "Old Nubian language\n\nOld Nubian (also called Middle Nubian or Old Nobiin) is an extinct Nubian language, attested in writing from the 8th to the 15th century AD. It is ancestral to modern-day Nobiin and closely related to Dongolawi and Kenzi. It was used throughout the kingdom of Makuria, including the eparchy of Nobatia. The language is preserved in more than hundred pages of documents and inscriptions, both of a religious (homilies, prayers, hagiographies, psalms, lectionaries), and related to the state and private life (legal documents, letters), written using an adaptation of the Coptic alphabet.\n\nOld Nubian had its source in the languages of the Noba nomads who occupied the Nile between the first and third cataracts of the Nile and the Makorae nomads who occupied the land between the third and fourth cataracts following the collapse of Meroë sometime in the 4th century. The Makorae were a separate tribe who eventually conquered or inherited the lands of the Noba: they established a Byzantine-influenced state called Makuria which administered the Noba lands separately as the eparchy of Nobatia. Nobatia was converted to the Miaphysite Christianity by Julian of Halicarnassus and Longinus, and thereafter received its bishops from the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.\n\nOld Nubian is one of the oldest written African languages and appears to have been adopted from the 10th-11th century as the main language for the civil and religious administration of Makuria. Besides Old Nubian, Koine Greek was widely used, especially in religious contexts, while Coptic mainly predominates in funerary inscriptions. Over time, more and more Old Nubian began to appear in both secular and religious documents, while several grammatical aspects of Greek, including the case, agreement, gender, and tense morphology underwent significant erosion. The consecration documents found with the remains of archbishop Timotheos suggest, however, that Greek and Coptic continued to be used into the late 14th century, by which time Arabic was also in widespread use.\n\nThe script in which nearly all Old Nubian texts have been written is a slanted uncial variant of the Coptic alphabet, originating from the White Monastery in Sohag.. The alphabet included three additional letters and , and , the first two deriving from the Meroitic alphabet. The presence of these characters suggest that although the first written evidence of Old Nubian dates to the 8th century, the script must have already been developed in the 6th century, following the collapse of the Meroitic state. Additionally, Old Nubian used the variant for the Coptic letter .\nThe characters only appear in Greek loanwords. Gemination was indicated by writing double consonants; long vowels were usually not distinguished from short ones. Old Nubian featured two digraphs: and . A diaeresis over () was used to indicate the semivowel . In addition, Old Nubian featured a supralinear stroke, which could indicate:\n\nModern Nobiin is a tonal language; if Old Nubian was tonal as well, the tones were not marked.\n\nPunctuation marks included a high dot •, sometimes substituted by a double backslash \\\\ (), which was used roughly like an English period or colon; a slash / (), which was used like a question mark; and a double slash // (), which was sometimes used to separate verses.\n\nOld Nubian has no gender or any articles. The noun consists of a stem to which derivational suffixes, plural markers, case markers, postpositions, and the determiner are added.\n\nOld Nubian has one definite determiner . The precise function of this morpheme has been a matter of controversy, with other scholars adopting the proposing nominative case or subjective marker. Both the distribution of the morpheme and comparative evidence from Meroitic, however, point to a use as determiner.\n\nOld Nubian has a nominative-accusative case system with four grammatical cases determining the key functions in the sentence, as well as a number of lexical cases for adverbial phrases.\n\n\nThe most common plural is in \"-gu-\"; e.g. \"uru-gu-na\" \"of kings\", or \"gindette-gu-ka\" \"thorns (object)\", becoming \"-agui-\" in the predicative. Rarer plurals include \"-rigu-\" (e.g. \"mug-rigu-ka\" \"dogs (obj.)\" (predicative \"-regui-\") and \"-pigu-\".\n\nThe basic pronouns are the following:\n\nDemonstratives include \"in-\" \"this\", \"man-\" \"that\"; interrogatives include \"ngai-\" \"who?\", \"min-\" \"what?\", \"islo\" \"where?\", \"iskal\" \"how?\".\n\nThe verb has five main forms: present, two different preterites, future, and imperative. For each of them, there are subjunctive and indicative forms. It conjugates according to person, e.g. for \"doll-\" \"wish\" in the present tense:\n\n\n\n\"Literally\": \"Rock and-when-they-rolled-away Jesus eye pair high raising he-said father I-thank you.\"\n\n\"Translated\": \"And when they rolled away the rock, Jesus, raising his eyes high, said: Father, I thank you.\"\n\n\n\n"}

PEP is normally considered the occasional or continuously repeating crest of the modulation envelope under normal operating conditions. The United States Federal Communications Commission uses PEP to set maximum power standards for amateur radio transmitters. \n\nAssuming linear, perfectly symmetrical, 100% modulation of a carrier, PEP output of an AM transmitter is four times its carrier PEP; in other words, a typical modern 100-watt amateur transceiver is usually rated for no more than, and often less than, 25 watts carrier output when operating in AM. \n\nPEP is equal to steady carrier power, or radiotelegraph dot or dash average power, in a properly-formed CW transmission. PEP is also equal to average power in a steady FM, FSK, or RTTY transmission. \n\nAlthough average power is the same as PEP for complex modulation forms, such as FSK, the peak envelope power bears no particular ratio or mathematical relationship to longer-term average power in distorted envelopes, such as a CW waveform with power overshoot, or with amplitude modulated waveforms, such as SSB or AM voice transmissions. Typical average power of a SSB voice transmission, for example, is 10-20% of PEP. The percentage of longer term average power to PEP increases with processing, and commonly reaches ~50% with extreme speech processing.\n\nMost modern amateur transceivers sample PEP to adjust power, using an ALC (automatic level control) system. Time delay in the ALC system and finite time of RF signals passing through multiple stages, in particular narrow filters, often gives rise to unusual envelope distortion. This distortion commonly appears as envelope power overshoot on leading edges, and sometimes causes negative carrier shift on AM. Some more poorly designed transceivers have a short term envelope power overshoot several times the steady-state PEP setting. This envelope overshoot further complicates definitions of PEP and average power. \n\nPEP was often used in non-broadcast AM applications because it most accurately described the potential of mobile transmitters to interfere with each other. Its use is now somewhat deprecated, with the \"average\" transmitter power output (or sometimes effective radiated power) now typically being preferred.\n\n"}

{"id": "23674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23674", "title": "Philosophical Investigations", "text": "Philosophical Investigations\n\nPhilosophical Investigations () is a work by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, first published, posthumously, in 1953, in which Wittgenstein discusses numerous problems and puzzles in the fields of semantics, logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of psychology, philosophy of action, and philosophy of mind. He puts forth the view that conceptual confusions surrounding language use are at the root of most philosophical problems, contradicting or discarding much of what he argued in his earlier work, the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" (1921).\n\nHe alleges that the problems are traceable to a set of related assumptions about the nature of language, which themselves presuppose a particular conception of the essence of language. This conception is considered and ultimately rejected for being too general; that is, as an essentialist account of the nature of language it is simply too narrow to be able to account for the variety of things we do with language. Wittgenstein begins the book with a quotation from Augustine of Hippo, whom he cites as a proponent of the generalized and limited conception that he then summarizes:\nThe individual words in language name objects—sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.\nHe then sets out throughout the rest of the book to demonstrate the limitations of this conception, including, he argues, with many traditional philosophical puzzles and confusions that arise as a result of this limited picture. \"Philosophical Investigations\" is highly influential. Within the analytic tradition, the book is considered by many as being one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century, and it continues to influence contemporary philosophers, especially those studying mind and language.\n\n\"Philosophical Investigations\" was not ready for publication when Wittgenstein died in 1951. G. E. M. Anscombe translated Wittgenstein's manuscript into English, and it was first published in 1953. There are multiple editions of \"Philosophical Investigations\" with the popular third edition and 50th anniversary edition having been edited by Anscombe: \n\nThe text is divided into two parts, consisting of what Wittgenstein calls, in the preface, \"Bemerkungen\", translated by Anscombe as \"remarks\". In the first part, these remarks are rarely more than a paragraph long and are numbered sequentially. In the second part, the remarks are longer and numbered using Roman numerals. In the index, remarks from the first part are referenced by their number rather than page; however, references from the second part are cited by page number. The comparatively unusual nature of the second part is due to the fact that it comprises notes that Wittgenstein may have intended to re-incorporate into the first part. Subsequent to his death it was published as a \"Part II\" in the first, second and third editions. However, in light of continuing uncertainty about Wittgenstein's intentions regarding this material, the fourth edition (2009) re-titles \"Part I\" as \"Philosophical Investigations\" proper, and \"Part II\" as \"Philosophy of Psychology – A Fragment.\"\n\nIn standard references, a small letter following a page, section, or proposition number indicates a paragraph.\n\n\"Philosophical Investigations\" is unique in its approach to philosophy. A typical philosophical text presents a philosophical problem, summarizes and critiques various alternative approaches to solving it, presents its approach, and then argues in favour of that approach. In contrast, Wittgenstein's book treats philosophy as an activity, rather along the lines of Socrates's famous method of maieutics; he has the reader work through various problems, participating actively in the investigation. Rather than presenting a philosophical problem and its solution, Wittgenstein engages in a dialogue, where he provides a language-game (a more or less ordinary use of the words in question), that describes how one might be inclined to think about it, and then shows why that inclination suffers from conceptual confusion. The following is an excerpt from the first entry in the book that exemplifies this method:\n\n...think of the following use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—\"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is to do with the word 'five'?\" Well, I assume that he \"acts\" as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is the meaning of the word 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.\n\nThis example is typical of the book's style. We can see each of the steps in Wittgenstein's method:\n\n\nThrough such language-games, Wittgenstein attempts to get the reader to come to certain difficult philosophical conclusions independently; he does not merely argue in favor of theories. \n\nThe \"Investigations\" deals largely with the difficulties of language and meaning. Wittgenstein viewed the tools of language as being fundamentally simple, and he believed that philosophers had obscured this simplicity by misusing language and by asking meaningless questions. He attempted in the \"Investigations\" to make things clear: \"Der Fliege den Ausweg aus dem Fliegenglas zeigen\"—to show the fly the way out of the fly bottle.\n\nA common summary of his argument is that meaning is use. According to the use theory of meaning, the words are not defined by reference to the objects they designate, nor by the mental representations one might associate with them, but by how they are used. For example, this means there is no need to postulate that there is something called \"good\" that exists independently of any good deed. If this is an anthropological perspective, then it can be said that it contrasts with Platonic realism and with Gottlob Frege's notions of sense and reference. This argument has been labeled by some authors as \"anthropological holism\".\n\nSection 43 in Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\" reads: \"For a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\" This suggests that in quite an early section of the book, Wittgenstein may think that meaning cannot be so easily glossed as how the word is used.\n\nWittgenstein rejects a variety of ways of thinking about what the meaning of a word is, or how meanings can be identified. He shows how, in each case, the \"meaning\" of the word presupposes our ability to use it. He first asks the reader to perform a thought experiment: to come up with a definition of the word \"game\". While this may at first seem a simple task, he then goes on to lead us through the problems with each of the possible definitions of the word \"game\". Any definition that focuses on amusement leaves us unsatisfied since the feelings experienced by a world class chess player are very different from those of a circle of children playing Duck Duck Goose. Any definition that focuses on competition will fail to explain the game of catch, or the game of solitaire. And a definition of the word \"game\" that focuses on rules will fall on similar difficulties.\n\nThe essential point of this exercise is often missed. Wittgenstein's point is not that it is impossible to define \"game\", but that \"we don't have a definition, and we don't need one\", because even without the definition, we \"use\" the word successfully. Everybody understands what we mean when we talk about playing a game, and we can even clearly identify and correct inaccurate uses of the word, all without reference to any definition that consists of necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept of a game. The German word for \"game\", \"Spiele/Spiel\", has a different sense than in English; the meaning of \"Spiele\" also extends to the concept of \"play\" and \"playing.\" This German sense of the word may help readers better understand Wittgenstein's context in the remarks regarding games.\n\nWittgenstein argues that definitions emerge from what he termed \"forms of life\", roughly the culture and society in which they are used. Wittgenstein stresses the social aspects of cognition; to see how language works for most cases, we have to see how it functions in a specific social situation. It is this emphasis on becoming attentive to the social backdrop against which language is rendered intelligible that explains Wittgenstein's elliptical comment that \"If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.\" However, in proposing the thought experiment involving the fictional character, Robinson Crusoe, a captain shipwrecked on a desolate island with no other inhabitant, Wittgenstein shows that language is not in all cases a social phenomenon (although, they are for most cases); instead the criterion for a language is grounded in a set of interrelated normative activities: teaching, explanations, techniques and criteria of correctness. In short, it is essential that a language is shareable, but this does not imply that for a language to function that it is in fact already shared.\n\nWittgenstein rejects the idea that ostensive definitions can provide us with the meaning of a word. For Wittgenstein, the thing that the word stands for does \"not\" give the meaning of the word. Wittgenstein argues for this making a series of moves to show that to understand an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the way the word being defined is used. So, for instance, there is no difference between pointing to a piece of paper, to its colour, or to its shape; but understanding the difference is crucial to using the paper in an ostensive definition of a shape or of a colour.\n\nWhy is it that we are sure a particular activity—e.g. Olympic target shooting—is a game while a similar activity—e.g. military sharp shooting—is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process—generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively \"see\" the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that the same is true of language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which \"are games\" and enough things which \"are not games\" that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.\n\nThis brings us back to Wittgenstein's reliance on indirect communication, and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't able to \"see\" family resemblances. We've made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to \"see\" the family resemblances.\n\nWittgenstein develops this discussion of games into the key notion of a \"language-game\". Wittgenstein introduces the term using simple examples, but intends it to be used for the many ways in which we use language. The central component of language games is that they are uses of language, and language is used in multifarious ways. For example, in one language-game, a word might be used to stand for (or refer to) an object, but in another the same word might be used for giving orders, or for asking questions, and so on. The famous example is the meaning of the word \"game\". We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, \"war games\". These are all different uses of the word \"games\". Wittgenstein also gives the example of \"Water!\", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or as an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game within which it is being used. Another way Wittgenstein puts the point is that the word \"water\" has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as code by members of a secret society.\n\nWittgenstein does not limit the application of his concept of language games to word-meaning. He also applies it to sentence-meaning. For example, the sentence \"Moses did not exist\" (§79) can mean various things. Wittgenstein argues that independently of use the sentence does not yet 'say' anything. It is 'meaningless' in the sense of not being significant for a particular purpose. It only acquires significance if we fix it within some context of use. Thus, it fails to say anything because the sentence as such does not yet determine some particular use. The sentence is only meaningful when it is used to say something. For instance, it can be used so as to say that no person or historical figure fits the set of descriptions attributed to the person that goes by the name of \"Moses\". But it can also mean that the leader of the Israelites was not called Moses. Or that there cannot have been anyone who accomplished all that the Bible relates of Moses, etc. What the sentence means thus depends on its context of use.\n\nOne general characteristic of games that Wittgenstein considers in detail is the way in which they consist in following rules. Rules constitute a family, rather than a class that can be explicitly defined. As a consequence, it is not possible to provide a definitive account of what it is to follow a rule. Indeed, he argues that \"any\" course of action can be made out to accord with some particular rule, and that therefore a rule cannot be used to explain an action. Rather, that one is following a rule or not is to be decided by looking to see if the actions conform to the expectations in the particular \"form of life\" in which one is involved. Following a rule is a social activity.\n\nWittgenstein also ponders the possibility of a language that talks about those things that are known only to the user, whose content is inherently private. The usual example is that of a language in which one names one's sensations and other subjective experiences, such that the meaning of the term is decided by the individual alone. For example, the individual names a particular sensation, on some occasion, 'S', and intends to use that word to refer to that sensation. Such a language Wittgenstein calls a \"private language\".\n\nWittgenstein presents several perspectives on the topic. One point he makes is that it is incoherent to talk of \"knowing\" that one is in some particular mental state. Whereas others can learn of my pain, for example, I simply \"have\" my own pain; it follows that one does not \"know\" of one's own pain, one simply \"has\" a pain. For Wittgenstein, this is a grammatical point, part of the way in which the language-game involving the word \"pain\" is played.\n\nAlthough Wittgenstein certainly argues that the notion of private language is incoherent, because of the way in which the text is presented the exact nature of the argument is disputed. First, he argues that a private language is not really a language at all. This point is intimately connected with a variety of other themes in his later works, especially his investigations of \"meaning\". For Wittgenstein, there is no single, coherent \"sample\" or \"object\" that we can call \"meaning\". Rather, the supposition that there are such things is the source of many philosophical confusions. Meaning is a complicated phenomenon that is woven into the fabric of our lives. A good first approximation of Wittgenstein's point is that meaning is a \"social\" event; meaning happens \"between\" language users. As a consequence, it makes no sense to talk about a private language, with words that \"mean\" something in the absence of other users of the language.\n\nWittgenstein also argues that one couldn't possibly \"use\" the words of a private language. He invites the reader to consider a case in which someone decides that each time she has a particular sensation she will place a sign S in a diary. Wittgenstein points out that in such a case one could have no criteria for the correctness of one's use of S. Again, several examples are considered. One is that perhaps using S involves mentally consulting a table of sensations, to check that one has associated S correctly; but in this case, how could the mental table be checked for its correctness? It is \"[a]s if someone were to buy several copies of the morning paper to assure himself that what it said was true\", as Wittgenstein puts it. One common interpretation of the argument is that while one may have direct or privileged access to one's \"current\" mental states, there is no such infallible access to identifying previous mental states that one had in the past. That is, the only way to check to see if one has applied the symbol S correctly to a certain mental state is to introspect and determine whether the current sensation is identical to the sensation previously associated with S. And while identifying one's current mental state of remembering may be infallible, whether one remembered correctly is not infallible. Thus, for a language to be used at all it must have some public criterion of identity.\n\nOften, what is widely regarded as a deep philosophical problem will vanish, argues Wittgenstein, and eventually be seen as a confusion about the significance of the words that philosophers use to frame such problems and questions. It is only in this way that it is interesting to talk about something like a \"private language\" — i.e., it is helpful to see how the \"problem\" results from a misunderstanding.\n\nTo sum up: Wittgenstein asserts that, if something is a language, it \"cannot\" be (logically) private; and if something \"is\" private, it is not (and cannot be) a language.\n\nAnother point that Wittgenstein makes against the possibility of a private language involves the beetle-in-a-box thought experiment. He asks the reader to imagine that each person has a box, inside of which is something that everyone intends to refer to with the word \"beetle\". Further, suppose that no one can look inside another's box, and each claims to know what a \"beetle\" is only by examining their own box. Wittgenstein suggests that, in such a situation, the word \"beetle\" could not be the name of a thing, because supposing that each person has something completely different in their boxes (or nothing at all) does not change the meaning of the word; the beetle as a private object \"drops out of consideration as irrelevant\". Thus, Wittgenstein argues, if we can talk about something, then it is not \"private\", in the sense considered. And, contrapositively, if we consider something to be indeed private, it follows that we \"cannot talk about it\".\n\nThe discussion of private languages was revitalized in 1982 with the publication of Saul Kripke's book \"Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language\". In this work, Kripke uses Wittgenstein's text to develop a particular type of skepticism about rules that stresses the \"communal\" nature of language-use as grounding meaning. Critics of Kripke's version of Wittgenstein have facetiously referred to it as \"Kripkenstein,\" scholars such as Gordon Baker, Peter Hacker, Colin McGinn, and John McDowell seeing it as a radical misinterpretation of Wittgenstein's text. Other philosophers – such as Martin Kusch – have defended Kripke's views.\n\nWittgenstein's investigations of language lead to several issues concerning the mind. His key target of criticism is any form of extreme mentalism that posits mental states that are entirely unconnected to the subject's environment. For Wittgenstein, thought is inevitably tied to language, which is inherently social; therefore, there is no 'inner' space in which thoughts can occur. Part of Wittgenstein's credo is captured in the following proclamation: \"An 'inner process' stands in need of outward criteria.\" This follows primarily from his conclusions about private languages: similarly, a private mental state (a sensation of pain, for example) cannot be adequately discussed without public criteria for identifying it.\n\nAccording to Wittgenstein, those who insist that consciousness (or any other apparently subjective mental state) is conceptually unconnected to the external world are mistaken. Wittgenstein explicitly criticizes so-called conceivability arguments: \"Could one imagine a stone's having consciousness? And if anyone can do so—why should that not merely prove that such image-mongery is of no interest to us?\" He considers and rejects the following reply as well:\n\n\"But if I suppose that someone is in pain, then I am simply supposing that he has just the same as I have so often had.\" — That gets us no further. It is as if I were to say: \"You surely know what 'It is 5 o'clock here' means; so you also know what 'It's 5 o'clock on the sun' means. It means simply that it is just the same there as it is here when it is 5 o'clock.\" — The explanation by means of \"identity\" does not work here.\n\nThus, according to Wittgenstein, mental states are intimately connected to a subject's environment, especially their linguistic environment, and conceivability or imaginability. Arguments that claim otherwise are misguided. Wittgenstein has also said that \"language is inherent and transcendental\", which is also not difficult to understand, since we can only comprehend and explain transcendental affairs through language.\n\nFrom his remarks on the importance of public, observable behavior (as opposed to private experiences), it may seem that Wittgenstein is simply a behaviorist—one who thinks that mental states are nothing over and above certain behavior. However, Wittgenstein resists such a characterization; he writes (considering what an objector might say):\n\n\"Are you not really a behaviourist in disguise? Aren't you at bottom really saying that everything except human behaviour is a fiction?\" — If I do speak of a fiction, then it is of a \"grammatical\" fiction.\n\nClearly, Wittgenstein did not want to be a behaviorist, nor did he want to be a cognitivist or a phenomenologist. He is, of course, primarily concerned with facts of linguistic usage. However, some argue that Wittgenstein is basically a behaviorist because he considers facts about language use as all there is. Such a claim is controversial, since it is not explicitly endorsed in the \"Investigations\".\n\nIn addition to ambiguous sentences, Wittgenstein discussed figures that can be seen and understood in two different ways. Often one can see something in a straightforward way — seeing \"that\" it is a rabbit, perhaps. But, at other times, one notices a particular aspect — seeing it \"as\" something.\n\nAn example Wittgenstein uses is the \"duckrabbit\", an ambiguous image that can be \"seen as\" either a duck or a rabbit. When one looks at the duck-rabbit and sees a rabbit, one is not \"interpreting\" the picture as a rabbit, but rather \"reporting\" what one sees. One just sees the picture as a rabbit. But what occurs when one sees it first as a duck, then as a rabbit? As the gnomic remarks in the \"Investigations\" indicate, Wittgenstein isn't sure. However, he is sure that it could not be the case that the external world stays the same while an 'internal' cognitive change takes place.\n\nAccording to the standard reading, in the \"Philosophical Investigations\" Wittgenstein repudiates many of his own earlier views, expressed in the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\". The \"Tractatus\", as Bertrand Russell saw it (though Wittgenstein took strong exception to Russell's reading), had been an attempt to set out a logically perfect language, building on Russell's own work. In the years between the two works Wittgenstein came to reject the idea that underpinned logical atomism, that there were ultimate \"simples\" from which a language should, or even could, be constructed.\n\nIn remark #23 of \"Philosophical Investigations\" he points out that the practice of human language is more complex than the simplified views of language that have been held by those who seek to explain or simulate human language by means of a formal system. It would be a disastrous mistake, according to Wittgenstein, to see language as being in any way analogous to formal logic.\n\nBesides stressing the \"Investigations\"' opposition to the \"Tractatus\", there are critical approaches which have argued that there is much more continuity and similarity between the two works than supposed. One of these is the New Wittgenstein approach.\n\nNorman Malcolm credits Piero Sraffa with providing Wittgenstein with the conceptual break that founded the \"Philosophical Investigations\", by means of a rude gesture on Sraffa's part:\n\n\"Wittgenstein was insisting that a proposition and that which it describes must have the same 'logical form', the same 'logical multiplicity', Sraffa made a gesture, familiar to Neapolitans as meaning something like disgust or contempt, of brushing the underneath of his chin with an outward sweep of the finger-tips of one hand. And he asked: 'What is the logical form of that?'\"\n\nThe preface itself, dated January 1945, credits Sraffa for the \"most consequential ideas\" of the book.\n\nBertrand Russell made the following comment on the \"Philosophical Investigations\" in his book \"My Philosophical Development\":I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.Ernest Gellner wrote the book \"Words and Things\", in which he was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal \"Mind\" (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to \"The Times\". A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1260116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1260116", "title": "Reading readiness in the United States", "text": "Reading readiness in the United States\n\nReading readiness has been defined as the point at which a person is ready to learn to read and the time during which a person transitions from being a non-reader into a reader. Other terms for reading readiness include early literacy and emergent reading.\n\nChildren begin to learn pre-reading skills at birth while they listen to the speech around them. In order to learn to read, a child must first have knowledge of the oral language. According to the Ontario Government (2003), the acquisition of language is natural, but the process of learning to read is not - reading must be taught. This belief contradicts basic language philosophy, which states that children learn to read while they learn to speak. The Ontario Government (2003) also believes that reading is the foundation for success, and that those children who struggle with reading in grades 1-3 are at a disadvantage in terms of academic success, compared to those children who are not struggling.\n\nBecause a child's early experience with literacy-related activities is highly correlated to the child's success with reading, it is important to consider a child's developmental level when choosing appropriate activities and goals. Early and enjoyable pre-reading experiences set the stage for a child's desire to learn. By participating in developmentally-appropriate activities (activities that are fun and challenging, but not frustrating), the child gains knowledge that will serve as the foundation for further learning as he or she enters the school system.\n\nReading readiness is highly individualistic. There is no \"one size fits all\" solution to teaching a child to read. A parent or educator may need to employ several techniques before finding the most appropriate method for an individual child. According to Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development a child can, through the help of an adult or more capable child, perform at a higher level than he or she can independently. The process of learning to read should thus be supported by a caring and supportive individual.\n\nSkills that indicate whether a child is ready to learn to read include:\n\n\nWhole Language: With this model, language is kept whole rather than segmented into fragments or skills. Within this philosophy, children are expected to learn to read and write in the same manner that they learn to talk. Reading, writing and oral language are considered to be intertwined. Some strategies according to the whole language model include encouraging the child to learn to read by \"reading,\" and making up stories that they think go along with the pictures in the book. This model also believes that adults should allow the child to witness reading behaviors, such as holding a book properly. It is also important for adults to model these behaviors in an environment that is free from criticism (Matthews, Klassen and Walter, 1999). An early proponent of whole language reading instruction called reading a \"psycholinguistic guessing game,\" and thus children are taught to guess words that they don't know by using context clues. Skipping unknown words is encouraged, and \"inventive\" spelling is also acceptable.\n\nPhonics: This popular method focuses on the relationship between what is SEEN and HEARD. Students learn rules for using alphabet letters (graphemes). \"Sounding-out letters\" can often be confusing because many words do not follow the rules—the rules are inconsistent and unreliable. However, the phonics approach is measurably MORE effective than having made NO attempt to teach language structure.\n\nIt is suggested that by providing the children with the knowledge of spelling patterns (that is, the combination of letters that are likely to occur within the English language) that spelling and reading will become much easier for the child. It is thought that once we (as adults) really look at the rules to the English language we use everyday and have internalized within ourselves, that it will become clear that there is some order and regular patterns that we follow. Once we are aware of these patterns, we can help children begin to understand these rules that we follow on a daily basis.\n\n\nThe two most influential perspectives are the \"growth-readiness\" view and the \"environmentalist\" view. The growth-readiness view focuses on the internal workings of the child in order to determine readiness, while environmentalists focus on the external environment. Both internal factors such as genetics and environmental aspects such as school atmosphere can influence a child’s readiness for reading.\n\nThe following is a list of books that are great for young readers. They contain vital elements such as repetition and bright colors. Many of these books also encourage the child to use their imagination by filling in the blank and taking an active role in the story.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "341857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341857", "title": "Tajik language", "text": "Tajik language\n\nTajik or Tajiki (Tajik: , ), also called Tajiki Persian (Tajik: , , ), is the variety of Persian spoken in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. It is closely related to Dari Persian. Since the beginning of the twentieth century and collapse of the Soviet Union, Tajik has been considered by a number of writers and researchers to be a variety of Persian (Halimov 1974: 30–31, Oafforov 1979: 33). The popularity of this conception of Tajik as a variety of Persian was such that, during the period in which Tajik intellectuals were trying to establish Tajik as a language separate from Persian, Sadriddin Ayni, who was a prominent intellectual and educator, had to make a statement that Tajik was not a bastardized dialect of Persian. The issue of whether Tajik and Persian are to be considered two dialects of a single language or two discrete languages has political sides to it (see Perry 1996). Today Tajik is recognized as a dialect of the Persian language.\n\nTajik is the official language of Tajikistan. In Afghanistan (where Tajik people make up a large part of the population), this language is less influenced by Turkic languages, is called Dari, and has co-official language status. Tajik has diverged from Persian as spoken in Afghanistan and Iran due to political borders, geographical isolation, the standardization process, and the influence of Russian and neighboring Turkic languages. The standard language is based on the northwestern dialects of Tajik (region of old major city of Samarqand), which have been somewhat influenced by the neighboring Uzbek language as a result of geographical proximity. Tajik also retains numerous archaic elements in its vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar that have been lost elsewhere in the Persophone world, in part due to its relative isolation in the mountains of Central Asia.\n\nThe most important cities of Central Asia—Samarkand and Bukhara—are in present-day Uzbekistan, where ethnic Tajiks comprise a majority. Today, virtually all Tajik speakers in Bukhara are bilingual in Tajik and Uzbek. This Tajik–Uzbek bilingualism has had a strong influence on the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Bukharan Tajik. Tajiks are also found in large numbers in the Surxondaryo Region in the south and along Uzbekistan's eastern border with Tajikistan. Tajik is still widely spoken in Samarqand and Buxoro today, as Tajiks account for perhaps 70% of the total population of Samarqand and have been estimated to make up as much as 90% of Buxoro.\n\nOfficial statistics in Uzbekistan state that the Tajik community comprises 5% of the nation's total population. However, these numbers do not include ethnic Tajiks who, for a variety of reasons, choose to identify themselves as Uzbeks in population census forms. During the Soviet \"Uzbekisation\" supervised by Sharof Rashidov, the head of the Uzbek Communist Party, Tajiks had to choose either to stay in Uzbekistan and get registered as Uzbek in their passports or leave the republic for the less-developed agricultural and mountainous Tajikistan. The \"Uzbekization\" movement ended in 1924.\nNative Tajiks living in the nation of Uzbekistan have reportedly estimated that Tajiks make up 25–30% of the nation's population.\n\nTajiks constitute 80% of Tajikistan's population, and the language dominates in most parts of the country. Some Tajiks in Badakhshan in southeastern Tajikistan, where the Pamir languages are the native languages of most residents, are bilingual. Tajiks are the dominant ethnic group in Northern Afghanistan as well, and are also the majority group in scattered pockets elsewhere in the country, particularly urban areas such as Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kunduz, Ghazni and Herat. Tajiks constitute between 25% and 30% of the total population of the country. In Afghanistan, the dialects spoken by ethnic Tajiks are written using the Persian alphabet and referred to as the Dari, along with the dialects of other groups in Afghanistan such as the Hazaragi and Aimaq dialects. Approximately 15-30% of Afghan citizens are native speakers of Dari. A large Tajik-speaking diaspora exists due to the instability that has plagued Central Asia in recent years, with significant numbers of Tajiks found in Russia, Kazakhstan, and beyond. This Tajik diaspora is also the result of the poor state of the economy of Tajikistan, and each year approximately one million men leave Tajikistan in order to gain employment in Russia.\n\nTajik dialects can be approximately split into the following groups:\n\n\nThe dialect used by the Bukharan Jews of Central Asia are known as the Bukhori dialect and belong to the northern dialect grouping. They are chiefly distinguished by the inclusion of Hebrew terms, principally religious vocabulary, and a historical use of the Hebrew alphabet. Despite these differences, Bukhori is readily intelligible to other Tajik-speakers, particularly speakers of northern dialects.\n\nA very important moment in the development of the contemporary Tajik, especially of the spoken language, is the tendency in changing its dialectal orientation. The dialects of Northern Tajikistan were the foundation of the prevalent standard Tajik, while the Southern dialects did not enjoy either popularity or prestige. Now all politicians and public officials make their speeches in the Kulob dialect, which is also used in broadcasting.\n\nThe table below lists the six vowel phonemes in standard, literary Tajik. Letters from the Tajik Cyrillic alphabet are given first, followed by IPA transcription. Local dialects frequently have more than the six seen below.\nIn central and southern dialects, merges with .\n\nThe open back vowel has varyingly been described as mid-back, , , and . It is analogous to standard Persian \"â\" (long \"a\").\n\nThe Tajik language contains 24 consonants,16 of which form contrastive pairs by voicing: [б/п] [в/ф] [д/т] [з/с] [ж/ш] [ҷ/ч] [г/к] [ғ/х]. The table below lists the consonant phonemes in standard, literary Tajik. Letters from the Tajik Cyrillic alphabet are given first, followed by IPA transcription.\n\nWord stress generally falls on the first syllable in finite verb forms and on the last syllable in nouns and noun-like words. Examples of where stress does not fall on the last syllable are adverbs like: бале (\"bale\", meaning \"yes\") and зеро (\"zero\", meaning \"because\"). Stress also does not fall on enclitics, nor on the marker of the direct object.\n\nThe word order of Tajiki Persian is subject–object–verb. Tajik Persian grammar is almost identical to the classical Persian grammar (and the grammar of modern varieties such as Iranian Persian), although there are notable differences. The most notable difference between classical Persian grammar and Tajik Persian grammar is the construction of the present progressive tense in each language. In Tajik, the present progressive form consists of a present progressive participle, from the verb истодан \"istodan\" 'to stand', and a cliticized form of the verb -acт \"-ast\" 'to be'.\n\nIn Classical Persian, the present progressive form consists of the verb دار \"dār\" 'to have' followed by a conjugated verb in either the simple present tense, the habitual past tense, or the habitual past perfect tense.\n\nNouns are not marked for grammatical gender, although they are marked for number.\n\nTwo forms of number exist in Tajik, singular and plural. The plural is marked by either the suffix -ҳо \"-ho\" or -он \"-on\" (with contextual variants -ён \"-yon\" and -гон \"-gon\"), although Arabic loan words may use Arabic forms. There is no definite article, but the indefinite article exists in the form of the number \"one\" як \"yak\", and -е \"-e\", the first positioned before the noun and the second joining the noun as a suffix. When a noun is used as a direct object, it is marked by the suffix -ро \"-ro\", e.g. Рустамро задам (\"Rustam-ro zadam\"), \"I hit Rustam\". This direct object suffix is added to the word after any plural suffixes. The form -ро can be literary or formal. In older forms of the Persian language, -ро could indicate both direct and indirect objects and some phrases used in modern Persian and Tajik have maintained this suffix on indirect objects, as seen in the following example: (Худоро шукр \"Xudo-ro šukr\" - \"Thank God\"). Modern Persian does not use the direct object marker as a suffix on the noun, but rather, as a stand-alone morpheme.\n\nTajik is conservative in its vocabulary, retaining numerous terms that have long since fallen into disuse in Iran and Afghanistan, such as арзиз (\"arziz\"), meaning \"tin\", and фарбеҳ (\"farbeh\"), meaning \"fat\". Most modern loan words in Tajik come from Russian as a result of the position of Tajikistan within the Soviet Union. The vast majority of these Russian loanwords which have entered the Tajik language through the fields of socioeconomics, technology, and government, where most of the concepts and vocabulary of these fields have been borrowed from the Russian language. The introduction of Russian loanwords into the Tajik language was largely justified under the Soviet policy of modernization and the necessary subordination of all languages to Russian for the achievement of a Communist state. Vocabulary also comes from the geographically close Uzbek language and, as is usual in Islamic countries, from Arabic. Since the late 1980s, an effort has been made to replace loanwords with native equivalents, using either old terms that had fallen out of use, or coined terminology. Many of the coined terms for modern items such as гармкунак (\"garmkunak\"), meaning 'heater' and чангкашак (\"čangkašak\"), meaning 'vacuum cleaner' differ from their Afghan and Iranian equivalents, adding to the difficulty in intelligibility between Tajik and other forms of Persian.\n\nIn the table below, Persian refers to the standard language of Iran, which differs somewhat from the Dari Persian of Afghanistan. Another Iranian language, Pashto, has also been included for comparative purposes.\n\nIn Tajikistan and other countries of the former Soviet Union, Tajik Persian is currently written in Cyrillic script, although it was written in the Latin script beginning in 1928, and the Arabic alphabet prior to 1928. In the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, the use of the Latin script was later replaced in 1939 by the Cyrillic script. The Tajik alphabet added six additional letters to the Cyrillic script inventory and these additional letters are distinguished in the Tajik orthography by the use of diacritics. In an interview to Iranian news media in 2008, Tajikistan's deputy culture minister said Tajikistan would study the issue of switching its Tajik alphabet from Cyrillic to Perso-Arabic script used in Iran and Afghanistan when the government feels that \"the Tajik people become familiar with the Persian alphabet\".\n\nAccording to many scholars, the New Persian language (which subsequently evolved into the Persian forms spoken in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan) developed in Transoxiana and Khorasan, in what are today parts of Afghanistan, Iran, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. While the New Persian language was descended primarily from Middle Persian, it also incorporated substantial elements of other Iranian languages of ancient Central Asia, such as Sogdian.\n\nFollowing the Arab conquest of Iran and most of Central Asia in the 8th century AD, Arabic for a time became the court language, and Persian and other Iranian languages were relegated to the private sphere. In the 9th century AD, following the rise of the Samanids, whose state was centered around the cities of Bukhoro (Buxoro), Samarqand and Herat, and covered much of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and northeastern Iran, New Persian emerged as the court language and swiftly displaced Arabic. Arabic influence continued to show itself in the form of the Perso-Arabic script used to write the language (replaced in Tajik by Latin and then Cyrillic in the 20th century) and a large number of Arabic loanwords.\n\nNew Persian became the lingua franca of Central Asia for centuries, although it eventually lost ground to the Chaghatai language in much of its former domains as a growing number of Turkic tribes moved into the region from the east. Since the 16th century AD, Tajik has come under increasing pressure from neighboring Turkic languages. Once spoken in areas of Turkmenistan, such as Merv, Tajik is today virtually non-existent in that country. Uzbek has also largely replaced Tajik in most areas of modern Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, Tajik persisted in pockets, notably in Samarqand, Bukhoro and Surxondaryo Province, as well as in much of what is today Tajikistan.\n\nThe Russian Empire in Russian Turkestan implemented Turkification upon the Ferghana and Sarmakand Tajiks replacing the Tajik language with Uzbek resulting in an Uzbek dominant speaking Samarkand whereas decades before Tajik was the dominant language in Samarkand.\n\nThe creation of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union in 1929 helped to safeguard the future of Tajik, as it became an official language of the republic alongside Russian. Still, substantial numbers of Tajik-speakers remained outside the borders of the republic, mostly in the neighboring Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, which created a source of tension between Tajiks and Uzbeks. Neither Samarqand nor Bukhoro was included in the nascent Tajik S.S.R., despite their immense historical importance in Tajik history. After the creation of the Tajik S.S.R., a large number of ethnic Tajiks from the Uzbek S.S.R. migrated there, particularly to the region of the capital, Dushanbe, exercising a substantial influence in the republic's political, cultural and economic life. The influence of this influx of ethnic Tajik immigrants from the Uzbek S.S.R. is most prominently manifested in the fact that literary Tajik is based on their northwestern dialects of the language, rather than the central dialects that are spoken by the natives in the Dushanbe region and adjacent areas.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union and Tajikistan's independence in 1991, the government of Tajikistan has made substantial efforts to promote the use of Tajik in all spheres of public and private life. Tajik is gaining ground among the once-Russified upper classes, and continues its role as the vernacular of the majority of the country's population. There has been a rise in the number of Tajik publications. Increasing contact with media from Iran and Afghanistan, after decades of isolation under the Soviets, is also having an effect on the development of the language.\n\n\n"}

Some scholars claim that Tifinagh-Tamazight is \"one of the oldest scripts in the world,\" being close both linguistically and in alphabet to Old Phoenician; that the Phoenician alphabet was progenitor of the Greek, and thereby Western alphabets.\n\nThe Tuareg languages are generally acknowledged as being the most conservative forms of Berber speech.\n\n\nBlench (ms, 2006) lists the following as separate languages, with dialects in parentheses:\n\nSpeakers of Tin Sert (Tetserret) identify as Tuareg, but the language is Western Berber.\n\nThe Tuareg languages may be written using the ancient Tifinagh (Libyco-Berber) script, the Latin script or the Arabic script. The Malian national literacy program DNAFLA has established a standard for the Latin alphabet, which is used with modifications in Prasse's \"Lexique\" and the government literacy program in Burkina, while in Niger a different system was used. There is also some variation in Tifinagh and in the Arabic script.\n\nEarly uses of the Tifinagh script have been found on rock art and in various sepulchres. Among these are the 1,500 year old monumental tomb of the Tuareg matriarch Tin Hinan, where vestiges of a Tifinagh inscription have been found on one of its walls.\n\nTifinagh usage is now restricted mainly to writing magical formulae, writing on palms when silence is required, and in letter-writing. The Arabic script is mostly in use by tribes more involved in Islamic learning, and little is known about its conventions.\n\nThe DNAFLA system is a somewhat morphophonemic orthography, not indicating initial vowel shortening, always writing the directional particle as < dd⟩, and not indicating all assimilations (e.g. for [tămašăq]).\n\nIn Burkina Faso the emphatics are denoted by \"hooked\" letters, as in Fula, e.g. .\n\nThe vowel system includes 5 long vowels, /a, e, i, o, u/, \"emphatic\" versions of /e, o/, and two short vowels, /ə, ă/. Karl Prasse argued that /e/ goes back to Proto-Berber, while /o/ is derived from /u/. Comparative evidence shows that /ə/ derives from a merger of Proto-Berber */ĭ/ and */ŭ/.\n\nSudlow classes the \"semivowels\" /w, j/ with the vowels, and notes the following possible diphthongs: /əw/ (> [u]), /ăw/, /aw/, /ew/, /iw/, /ow/, /uw/, /əj/ (> [i]), /ăj/, /aj/, /ej/, /ij/, /oj/, /uj/.\n\nBefore emphatics, vowels lower, turning /ə/ into [ă], /e, i/ into \"emphatic\" [e], and /u, o/ into \"emphatic\" [o], with some dialectal variation (with the realizations of /i, u/ \"less open\" than /e, o/).\n\nThe consonant inventory largely resembles Arabic: differentiated voicing; uvulars, pharyngeals (traditionally referred to as emphatics) ; requiring the pharynx muscles to contract and influencing the pronunciation of the following vowel (although only occur in Arabic loans and only in the name of Allah).\n\nThe glottal stop is non-phonemic. It occurs at the beginning of vowel-initial words to fill the place of the initial consonant in the syllable structure (see below), although if the words is preceded by a word ending in a consonant, it makes a liaison instead. Phrase-final /a/ is also followed by a phonetic glottal stop.\n\nGemination is contrastive. Normally becomes , becomes , and becomes . and are predominantly geminate. In addition, in Tadraq is usually geminate, but in Tudalt singleton may occur.\n\nVoicing assimilation occurs, with the first consonant taking the voicing of the second (e.g. > ).\n\nCluster reduction turns word/morpheme-final into and into (e.g. > 'Tamasheq').\n\nSyllable structure is CV(C)(C), including glottal stops (see above).\n\nContrastive stress may occur in the stative aspect of verbs.\n\nDifferent dialects have slightly different consonant inventories. Some of these differences can be diachronically accounted for. For example, Proto-Berber \"*h\" is mostly lost in Ayer Tuareg, while it is maintained in almost every position in Mali Tuareg. The Iwellemmeden and Ahaggar Tuareg dialects are midway between these positions. The Proto-Berber consonant \"*z\" comes out differently in different dialects, a development that is to some degree reflected in the dialect names. It is realized as \"h\" in Tamahaq (Tahaggart), as \"š\" in Tamasheq and as simple \"z\" in the Tamajaq dialects Tawallammat and Tayart. In the latter two, \"*z\" is realised as \"ž\" before palatal vowels, explaining the form \"Tamajaq\". In Tawallammat and especially Tayart, this kind of palatalization actually does not confine itself to \"z\". In these dialects, dentals in general are palatalized before and . For example, \"tidət\" is pronounced in Tayart.\n\nOther differences can easily be traced back to borrowing. For example, the Arabic pharyngeals \"ħ\" and \"ʻ\" have been borrowed along with Arabic loanwords by dialects specialized in Islamic (Maraboutic) learning. Other dialects substitute \"ħ\" and \"ʻ\" respectively with \"x\" and \"ɣ\".\n\nThe basic word order in Tuareg is verb–subject–object. Verbs can be grouped into 19 morphological classes; some of these classes can be defined semantically. Verbs carry information on the subject of the sentence in the form of pronominal marking. No simple adjectives exist in the Tuareg languages; adjectival concepts are expressed using a relative verb form traditionally called 'participle'. The Tuareg languages have very heavily influenced Northern Songhay languages such as Sawaq, whose speakers are culturally Tuareg but speak Songhay; this influence includes points of phonology and sometimes grammar as well as extensive loanwords.\n\nTamasheq prefers VSO order; however it contains topic–comment structure (like in American Sign Language, Modern Hebrew, Japanese and Russian), allowing the emphasized concept to be placed first, be it the subject or object, the latter giving an effect somewhat like the English passive. Sudlow uses the following examples, all expressing the concept “Men don’t cook porridge” (e denotes Sudlow’s schwa):\n\nAgain like Japanese, the “pronoun/particle ‘a’ is used with a following relative clause to bring a noun in a phrase to the beginning for emphasis,” a structure which can be used to emphasize even objects of prepositions. Sudlow’s example (s denotes voiceless palato-alveolar fricative):\n\nThe indirect object marker takes the form i/y in Tudalt and e/y in Tadraq.\n\nAs a root-and-pattern, or templatic language, triliteral roots (three-consonant bases) are the most common in Tamasheq. Niels and Regula Christiansen use the root k-t-b (to write) to demonstrate past completed aspect conjugation:\n\nThe verbal correspondence with the use of aspect; Tamasheq uses four, as delineated by Sudlow:\n\n\nCommands are expressed in the imperative mood, which tends to be a form of the imperfective aspect, unless the action is to be repeated or continued, in which case the cursive aspect is preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
