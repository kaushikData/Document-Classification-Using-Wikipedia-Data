{"id": "316889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316889", "title": "Anthology", "text": "Anthology\n\nIn book publishing, an anthology is a collection of literary works chosen by the compiler. It may be a collection of poems, short stories, plays, songs, or excerpts by different authors. In genre fiction, \"anthology\" is used to categorize collections of shorter works such as short stories and short novels, by different authors, each featuring unrelated casts of characters and settings, and usually collected into a single volume for publication.\n\nThe complete collections of works are often called complete works or Opera Omnia (Latin language equivalent).\n\nThe word entered the English language in the 17th century, from the Greek word, ἀνθολογία (\"anthologia\" \"a collection of flowers\"), a reference to one of the earliest known anthologies, the \"Garland\" (), the introduction to which compares each of its anthologized poets to a flower. That \"Garland\" by Meleager of Gléagros of Gadara formed the kernel for what has become known as the Greek Anthology.\n\n\"Florilegium\", a Latin derivative for a collection of flowers, was used in medieval Europe for an anthology of Latin proverbs and textual excerpts. Shortly before anthology had entered the language, English had begun using as a word for such a collection.\n\nIn East Asian tradition, an anthology was a recognised form of compilation of a given poetic form. It was assumed that there was a cyclic development: any particular form, say the \"tanka\" in Japan, would be introduced at one point in history, be explored by masters during a subsequent time, and finally be subject to popularisation (and a certain dilution) when it achieved widespread recognition. In this model, which derives from Chinese tradition, the object of compiling an anthology was to preserve the best of a form, and cull the rest.\n\nIn Malaysia, an anthology (or \"antologi\" in Malay) is a collection of \"syair\", \"sajak\" (or modern prose), proses, drama scripts, and pantuns. Notable anthologies that are used in secondary schools include \"Sehijau Warna Daun\", \"Seuntai Kata Untuk Dirasa\", \"Anak Bumi Tercinta\", \"Anak Laut\" and \"Kerusi\".\n\nIn the twentieth century, anthologies became an important part of poetry publishing for a number of reasons. For English poetry, the Georgian poetry series was trend-setting; it showed the potential success of publishing an identifiable group of younger poets marked out as a 'generation'. It was followed by numerous collections from the 'stable' of some literary editor, or collated from a given publication, or labelled in some fashion as 'poems of the year'. Academic publishing also followed suit, with the success of the Quiller-Couch Oxford Book of English Verse encouraging other collections not limited to modern poetry. The concept of 'modern verse' was fostered by the appearance of the phrase in titles such as the Faber & Faber anthology by Michael Roberts, and the very different William Butler Yeats Oxford Book of Modern Verse.\n\nSince publishers generally found anthology publication a more flexible medium than the collection of a single poet's work, and indeed rang innumerable changes on the idea as a way of marketing poetry, publication in an anthology (in the right company) became at times a sought-after form of recognition for poets. The self-definition of movements, dating back at least to Ezra Pound's efforts on behalf of Imagism, could be linked on one front to the production of an anthology of the like-minded. Also, whilst not connected with poetry, publishers have produced collective works of fiction from a number of authors and used the term anthology to describe the collective nature of the text. These have been in a number of subjects, including \"Erotica\", edited by Mitzi Szereto and \"American Gothic Tales\" edited by Joyce Carol Oates.\n\n"}

Since 2000, Azhagi has provided support to Tamil transliteration; later this was expanded to nearly 13 Indian Languages.\n\nIn 2006 Azhagi was the recipient of the Manthan Award of India's Digital Empowerment Foundation and the World Summit Award project, in the category Localization. In the same year Azhagi was identified as a \"success story\" by Microsoft's Bhashaindia.com Indic language computing site.\n\nAzhagi is the first successful Tamil transliteration tool which has lots of users throughout the world. Azhagi helps the user to create and edit contents in several Indian languages including Tamil, Hindi, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Konkani, Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi, Oriya and Assamese without having to know typing in these languages. Text of these languages can be produced only typing the phonetic equivalent of English. Azhagi can be embedded for direct typing text of these languages in applications apart from Notepad, including Microsoft products like MS Office, OpenOffice.org and also other applications all the web browsers.\n\nAzhagi initially developed as a Tamil word processor having its own screen for typing contents in Tamil. The user can optionally select a dual screen or a single screen for transliteration. The Tamil text corresponding to the English text forming the phonetic equivalent of Tamil typed in the upper half of the screen is displayed in the lower half. This feature enables the user to ascertain the correctness of contents being typed. The single screen option can be chosen by users who have become familiar with the key mappings to be able to see larger portion of text than that seen in dual screen mode.\n\nThe mapping summary that lists the English alphabets to be typed to get every Tamil alphabet is presented in the form of a concise table in the Azhagi Screen. This guides the new user who is yet to become familiar with the key mappings in finding the correct for every alphabet. The text displayed in Azhagi screen is with TSCII encoding. A Unicode editor for typing Tamil text in UTF-8 encoding with a separate display screen comes together with Azhagi.\n\nAzhagi has another novel application known as Azhagi+ that enables wider range of settings and options to the user.\n\n\nIn 2016, Azhagi has launched the Mobile App for Android users with the custom transliteration feature. Though this app is created based on Indic Keyboard, it supports both the transliteration and transcription.\n\nB. Vishwanathan, a software professional, developed Azhagi after he quit from Tata Consultancy Services due to illness. During 1999, the transliteration tools in Tamil had a lot of rough edges. Most importantly, it was not user-friendly. It was then, Viswanathan resolved to develop a user-friendly English-to-Tamil transliteration software. Later in 2000, Azhagi was released and he named the software Azhagi, to symbolise his wife's 'beautiful' heart.\n\nLot of websites, software, documents which uses the Tamil font make use of the Azhagi and it has support from the user and they are displaying their thanks giving note on their blogs and web pages. In addition to the transliteration tool, Azhagi also provides links to hundreds of free Tamil fonts in Unicode, TSCII, TAB and TAM format.\nIt is recommended by lot of users and its popularity is also increased gradually.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the second son of his parents Lalitram Kakati and Lahobala. Kakati showed sign of his genius from his early childhood. In his school days he obtained 105 marks out of 100 in his Sanskrit answer book. It is also said that he could memorize the whole of Pāṇini in his school days.\n\nTo know more about the Kakatis as a caste in North-east India, Go to the following link\n\nKakati secured the highest position in English in Assam in his matriculation under the Calcutta University. 1913, he stood first amongst all the candidates in the intermediate from Cotton College, Guwahati under the Calcutta University. He took first M.A. degree in English Literature from Presidency College, Calcutta in 1918. Later on he secured the first class first position in M.A. in English Language group in 1923 from Calcutta University.\n\nKakati joined Cotton College in 1918 as a professor of English until he became the principal of the College in 1947. He joined in Gauhati University in 1948 as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Head of the Department of Assamese.\n\nKakati's health broke after the demise of his beloved wife Kanaklata in 1952 and died in the same year, on 15 November, the date of his birth.\n\nSoon after joining Cotton College as a lecturer in 1918, Banikanta Kakati took up the study of Srimanta Sankardeva and old Assamese literature. Soon, he was drawn into a controversy between two rival schools of Assam Vaishnavism. His erudite exposition of scriptural lore in the various issues of the Banhi under the pseudonym of Babananda Pathak, in defence of the values represented by the teachings of Sankardeva still makes fruitful reading.\n\nWhile studying MA examination in English, he obtained his doctorate for his thesis – Assamese : Its Formation and Development in 1935. The publication of the thesis in 1941 was a god-send for the Assamese people who had been frantically struggling to establish the identity and provenance of their mother tongue. Kakati had to work far from the great centres of learning, in a place where even Leonard Bloomfields’ Language (1833) could not be made available. Yet the work was acclaimed by no lesser an authority than Dr Emeneau who found it ‘ground-breaking in many ways.’\n\nHis interest in language proliferated over the years, but meanwhile, his mind started straying into other fields and pastures new. He made an intensive study of the Kalita caste and incorporated his findings in \"Kalita Jatir Itibritta (1941)\", \"Mother Goddess Kamakhya (1948)\" deals with socio-religious issues prevalent in Ancient Kamarupa. Finally he turned his attention to Indian mythology and his Vaishnavite Myths and Legends has been acclaimed as 'one of the very few studies of the religious scene in India, produced by our scholars, that deserve reading and pondering over.'\n\nDr Kakati was one of the greatest critics that the country has produced. His \"Purani Asomiya Sahitya\" provides the axes for the appreciation of Vaishnavite literature of medieval Assam. He was certainly the most capable interpreter of religious mysticism in the poetry of the Nam Ghosha. He also raised the perennial issue of a possible tension between poetry and belief.\n\nHimself a scion of the Romantic age, Kakati sketched the critical background for the twentieth century Assamese romantics. The post-war decade in Assam is a decade of disenchantment. In this decade he also wrote on the contemporary situation which seemed to show that a great age was over and another was yet to be born. He died too early to see the achievements of the ensuing age.\n\nBanikanta Kakati's writings both in English and Assamese mark a distinct achievement in the history of Assamese scholarship. As a critic of old and new literature in Assamese and as a writer on sociology and religious trends in medieval India-particularly Assam, he set new standards.\n\nIn English:\n\nIn Assamese:\n\n"}

{"id": "59338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59338", "title": "Bracket", "text": "Bracket\n\nA bracket is a tall punctuation mark commonly used in matched pairs within text, to set apart or interject other text. The matched pair is best described as \"opening\" and \"closing\". Less formally, in a left-to-right context, it may be described as \"left\" and \"right\", and in a right-to-left context, as \"right\" and \"left\".\n\nForms include round (also called \"parentheses\"), square, curly (also called \"braces\"), and angle brackets (also called \"chevrons\"), as well as various other pairs of symbols.\n\nIn addition to referring to the class of all types of brackets, the unqualified word \"bracket\" is most commonly used to refer to a specific type of bracket: in modern American usage, this is usually the square bracket and in modern British usage, this is usually the round bracket.\n\nChevrons (⟨ ⟩) were the earliest type of bracket to appear in written English. Desiderius Erasmus coined the term \"lunula\" to refer to the rounded parentheses (), recalling the shape of the crescent moon.\n\nSome of the following names are regional or contextual.\n\n\nThe characters ‹ › and « », known as s or angular quote brackets, are actually quotation mark glyphs used in several European languages. Which one of each pair is the opening quote mark and which is the closing quote varies between languages.\n\nSimilarly, the corner-brackets ｢ ｣ are quotation marks used in East Asian languages (see Quotation mark § Chinese, Japanese and Korean quotation marks).\n\nIn English, typographers mostly prefer to not set brackets in italics, even when the enclosed text is italic. However, in other languages like German, if brackets enclose text in italics, they are usually set in italics too.\n\nParentheses (singular, parenthesis ) (also called simply brackets, or round brackets, curves, curved brackets, oval brackets, stalls or, colloquially, parens ) contain material that serves to clarify (in the manner of a gloss) or is aside from the main point. A milder effect may be obtained by using a pair of commas as the delimiter, though if the sentence contains commas for other purposes, visual confusion may result.\n\nIn American usage, parentheses are usually considered separate from other brackets, and calling them \"brackets\" is unusual.\n\nParentheses may be used in formal writing to add supplementary information, such as \"Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) spoke at length\". They can also indicate shorthand for \"either singular or plural\" for nouns, e.g. \"the claim(s)\". It can also be used for gender neutral language, especially in languages with grammatical gender, e.g. \"(s)he agreed with his (her) physician\".\n\nParenthetical phrases have been used extensively in informal writing and stream of consciousness literature. Examples include the southern American author William Faulkner (see \"Absalom, Absalom!\" and ) as well as poet E. E. Cummings.\n\nParentheses have historically been used where the dash is currently used in alternatives, such as \"parenthesis)(parentheses\". Examples of this usage can be seen in editions of \"Fowler's\".\n\nParentheses may be nested (generally with one set (such as this) inside another set). This is not commonly used in formal writing (though sometimes other brackets [especially square brackets] will be used for one or more inner set of parentheses [in other words, secondary {or even tertiary} phrases can be found within the main parenthetical sentence]).\n\nAny punctuation inside parentheses or other brackets is independent of the rest of the text: \"Mrs. Pennyfarthing (What? Yes, that was her name!) was my landlady.\" In this usage, the explanatory text in the parentheses is a parenthesis. (Parenthesized text is usually short and within a single sentence. Where several sentences of supplemental material are used in parentheses the final full stop would be within the parentheses, or simply omitted. Again, the parenthesis implies that the meaning and flow of the text is supplemental to the rest of the text and the whole would be unchanged were the parenthesized sentences removed.)\n\nIn more formal usage, \"parenthesis\" may refer to the entire bracketed text, not just to the punctuation marks used (so all the text in this set of round brackets may be said to be \"a parenthesis\", \"a parenthetical\", or \"a parenthetical phrase\").\n\nLower-case Latin letters used as indexes, rather than bullets or numbers, followed by an unpaired parenthesis, are used in ordered lists especially in:\n\nSince 2014, antisemites have used triple parentheses around the names of people to denote them as Jewish.\n\nParentheses are used in mathematical notation to indicate grouping, often inducing a different order of operations. For example: in the usual order of algebraic operations, equals 14, since the multiplication is done before the addition. However, equals 20, because the parentheses override normal precedence, causing the addition to be done first. Some authors follow the convention in mathematical equations that, when parentheses have one level of nesting, the inner pair are parentheses and the outer pair are square brackets. Example:\n\nA related convention is that when parentheses have two levels of nesting, curly brackets (braces) are the outermost pair. Following this convention, when more than three levels of nesting are needed, often a cycle of parentheses, square brackets, and curly brackets will continue. This helps to distinguish between one such level and the next.\n\nParentheses are also used to set apart the arguments in mathematical functions. For example, is the function ' applied to the variable '. In coordinate systems parentheses are used to denote a set of coordinates; so in the Cartesian coordinate system may represent the point located at 4 on the \"x\"-axis and 7 on the \"y\"-axis. \n\nParentheses may also be used to represent a binomial coefficient.\n\nParentheses are included in the syntaxes of many programming languages. Typically needed to denote an argument; to tell the compiler what data type the Method/Function needs to look for first in order to initialise. In some cases, such as in LISP, parentheses are a fundamental construct of the language.\n\nParentheses are used in chemistry to denote a polyatomic ion. They can be used in various fields as notation to indicate the amount of uncertainty. For example:\nis equivalent to:\n\nMany online Roleplayers use double parentheses to connotate out-of-character (OOC) messages that one may send another.\n\nSquare brackets—also called crotchets or simply brackets (US)—are mainly used to insert explanatory material or to mark where a passage was omitted from an original material by someone other than the original author, or to mark modifications in quotations.\n\nA bracketed ellipsis, […], is often used to indicate omitted material: \"I'd like to thank [several unimportant people] for their tolerance [...]\"\nBracketed comments inserted into a quote indicate when the original has been modified for clarity: \"I appreciate it [the honor], but I must refuse\", and \"the future of psionics [see definition] is in doubt\". Or one can quote the original statement \"I hate to do laundry\" with a (sometimes grammatical) modification inserted: He \"hate[s] to do laundry\".\n\nAdditionally, a small letter can be replaced by a capital one, when the beginning of the original text is omitted for succinctness, for example, when referring to a verbose original: \"To the extent that policymakers and elite opinion in general have made use of economic analysis at all, they have, as the saying goes, done so the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination\", it can be quoted succinctly as: \"[P]olicymakers […] made use of economic analysis […] the way a drunkard uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination.\" When nested parentheses are needed, brackets are used as a substitute for the inner pair of parentheses within the outer pair. When deeper levels of nesting are needed, convention is to alternate between parentheses and brackets at each level.\n\nAlternatively, empty square brackets can also indicate omitted material, usually single letter only. The original \"Reading is also a process and it also changes you.\" can be rewritten in a quote as: It has been suggested that reading can \"also change[] you\".\n\nThe bracketed expression \"[\"sic\"]\" is used after a quote or reprinted text to indicate the passage appears exactly as in the original source, where it may otherwise appear that a mistake has been made in reproduction.\n\nIn translated works, brackets are used to signify the same word or phrase in the original language to avoid ambiguity.\nFor example: \"He is trained in the way of the open hand [karate].\"\n\nBrackets (called \"move-left symbols\" or \"move right symbols\") are added to the sides of text in proofreading to indicate changes in indentation:\n\nBrackets are used in mathematics in a variety of notations, including standard notations for commutators, the floor function, the Lie bracket, equivalence classes, the Iverson bracket, and matrices. Square brackets may also represent closed intervals; formula_2 for example, represents the set of real numbers from 0 to 5 inclusive.\n\nBrackets can also be used in chemistry to represent the concentration of a chemical substance or to denote distributed charge in a complex ion.\n\nBrackets are used in many computer programming languages, primarily to force the order of evaluation and for parameter lists and array indexing. But they are also used to denote general tuples, sets and other structures, just as in mathematics. There may be several other uses as well, depending on the language at hand.\n\nIn linguistics, phonetic transcriptions are generally enclosed within brackets, often using the International Phonetic Alphabet, whereas phonemic transcriptions typically use paired slashes. Pipes (| |) are often used to indicate a morphophonemic rather than phonemic representation. Other conventions are double slashes (// //), double pipes (|| ||) and curly brackets ({ }). In lexicography, square brackets usually surround the section of a dictionary entry which contains the etymology of the word the entry defines.\n\nBrackets are used to denote parts of the text that need to be checked when preparing drafts prior to finalizing a document. They often denote points that have not yet been agreed to in legal drafts and the year in which a report was made for certain case law decisions.\n\nCurly brackets { and } are also called braces in the United States (or, colloquially, squiggly brackets). They are rarely used in prose and have no widely accepted use in formal writing, but may be used to mark words or sentences that should be taken as a group, to avoid confusion when other types of brackets are already in use, or for a special purpose specific to the publication (such as in a dictionary). More commonly, they are used to indicate a group of lines that should be taken together, as in when referring to several lines of poetry that should be repeated.\n\nIn music, they are known as accolades or \"braces\", and connect two or more lines (staves) of music that are played simultaneously.\n\nIn mathematics they delimit sets, and in writing, they may be used similarly, \"Select your animal {goat, sheep, cow, horse} and follow me\". In many programming languages, they enclose groups of statements and create a local scope. Such languages (C being one of the best-known examples) are therefore called curly bracket languages. In classical mechanics, curly brackets are often also used to denote the Poisson bracket between two quantities.\n\n , similar to the commonly used less-than (<) and greater-than sign (>), are often used to enclose highlighted material.\n\nIn physical sciences, chevrons are used to denote an average over time or over another continuous parameter. For example,\n\nThe inner product of two vectors is commonly written as , but the notation is also used.\n\nIn mathematical physics, especially quantum mechanics, it is common to write the inner product between elements as , as a short version of , or , where is an operator. This is known as Dirac notation or bra–ket notation.\n\nIn set theory, chevrons or parentheses are used to denote ordered pairs and other tuples, whereas curly brackets are used for unordered sets.\n\nIn linguistics, chevrons indicate graphemes (i.e., written letters) or orthography, as in \"The English word is spelled .\"\n\nIn epigraphy, they may be used for mechanical transliterations of a text into the Latin script.\n\nIn textual criticism, and hence in many editions of pre-modern works, chevrons denote sections of the text which are illegible or otherwise lost; the editor will often insert their own reconstruction where possible within them.\n\nChevrons are infrequently used to denote words that are thought instead of spoken, such as:\n\nThe mathematical or logical symbols for \"greater-than\" (>) and \"less-than\" (<) are inequality symbols; when either symbol is bisected by a vertical line, it represents \"not greater than\" or \"not less than,\" respectively. These symbols are not punctuation marks when used, as intended, to represent an inequality. However, as true chevrons are not present on computer keyboards, the available less-than and greater-than symbols are often used instead. They are loosely referred to as \"angle[d] brackets\" or \"chevrons\" in this case, but more properly — and less confusingly — as \"pointy brackets\" (see the Names section above).\n\nSingle and double pairs of comparison operators («, ») (meaning \"much smaller than\" and \"much greater than\") are sometimes used as a fallback instead of guillemets («, ») (used as quotation marks in many languages) when the proper characters are not available on the keyboard nor in the input editor. Similarly, early Internet messaging conventions developed to use the \"greater-than\" sign (>), available in the ASCII character set, to mark quoted lines. This format, known as Usenet quoting, is used by email clients when operating in plain text mode.\n\nIn comic books, chevrons are often used to mark dialogue that has been translated notionally from another language; in other words, if a character is speaking another language, instead of writing in the other language and providing a translation, one writes the translated text within chevrons. Of course, since no foreign language is actually written, this is only \"notionally\" translated.\n\nIn continuum mechanics, chevrons may be used as Macaulay brackets.\n\nIn East Asian punctuation, angle brackets are used as quotation marks. Chevron-like symbols are part of standard Chinese, and Korean punctuation, where they generally enclose the titles of books: ︿ and ﹀ or ︽ and ︾ for traditional vertical printing, and 〈 and 〉 or 《 and 》 for horizontal printing.\n\nSome East Asian languages use lenticular brackets 【 】, a combination of square brackets and round brackets called (\"fāngtóu kuòhào\") in Chinese and (\"sumitsuki\") in Japanese. and used in titles and headings in Japanese.\n\nThe floor corner brackets ⌊ and ⌋, the ceiling corner brackets ⌈ and ⌉ are used to denote the integer floor and ceiling functions.\n\nThe Quine corners ⌜ and ⌝ have at least two uses in mathematical logic: either as quasi-quotation, a generalization of quotation marks, or to denote the Gödel number of the enclosed expression.\n\nHalf brackets are used in English to mark added text, such as in translations: \"Bill saw ⸤her⸥\".\n\nIn editions of papyrological texts, half brackets, ⸤ and ⸥ or ⸢ and ⸣, enclose text which is lacking in the papyrus due to damage, but can be restored by virtue of another source, such as an ancient quotation of the text transmitted by the papyrus. For example, Callimachus \"Iambus\" 1.2 reads: ἐκ τῶν ὅκου βοῦν κολλύ⸤βου π⸥ιπρήσκουσιν. A hole in the papyrus has obliterated βου π, but these letters are supplied by an ancient commentary on the poem. Second intermittent sources can be between ⸢ and ⸣. Quine corners are sometimes used instead of half brackets.\n\nDouble brackets (or white square brackets), ⟦ ⟧, are used to indicate the \"semantic evaluation function\" in formal semantics for natural language and denotational semantics for programming languages. The brackets stand for a function that maps a linguistic expression to its “denotation” or semantic value. Double brackets may also refer to the mathematical floor function.\n\nKnown as \"spike parentheses\" () ⁅ and ⁆ are used in Swedish dictionaries.\n\nThe various bracket characters are frequently used in many programming languages as operators or for other syntax markup. For instance, in C-like languages, codice_1 and codice_2 are often used to delimit a code block, and the parameters of method calls are generally enclosed by codice_3 and codice_4.\n\nIn C, C++, Java and other C-derived languages—as well as in Scheme-influenced languages that have adopted C/Java syntax, such as JavaScript—the \"codice_5\" symbols are referred to as \"braces\" or \"curly braces\" and never as brackets. Since the term \"brace\" is documented in the definitive programming specifications for these languages, it is preferable to use the correct term brace so there is no confusion between the brace (used to denote compound statements) and the bracket, used to denote other concepts, such as array indices.\n\nIn addition to the use of parentheses to specify the order of operations, both parentheses and brackets are used to denote an interval, also referred to as a half-open range. The notation is used to indicate an interval from to that is inclusive of but exclusive of . That is, would be the set of all real numbers between 5 and 12, including 5 but not 12. The numbers may come as close as they like to 12, including 11.999 and so forth (with any finite number of 9s), but 12.0 is not included. In some European countries, the notation is also used for this. The endpoint adjoining the bracket is known as \"closed\", whereas the endpoint adjoining the parenthesis is known as \"open\". If both types of brackets are the same, the entire interval may be referred to as \"closed\" or \"open\" as appropriate. Whenever +∞ or −∞ is used as an endpoint, it is normally considered \"open\" and adjoined to a parenthesis. See Interval (mathematics) for a more complete treatment.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, chevrons are also used as part of Dirac's formalism, bra–ket notation, to note vectors from the dual spaces of the Bra . Mathematicians will also commonly write for the inner product of two vectors. In statistical mechanics, chevrons denote ensemble or time average. Chevrons are used in group theory to write group presentations, and to denote the subgroup generated by a collection of elements. Note that obtuse angled chevrons are not always (and even not by all users) distinguished from a pair of less-than and greater-than signs <>, which are sometimes used as a typographic approximation of chevrons.\n\nIn group theory and ring theory, brackets denote the commutator. In group theory, the commutator is commonly defined as . In ring theory, the commutator is defined as . Furthermore, in ring theory, braces denote the anticommutator where is defined as . The bracket is also used to denote the Lie derivative, or more generally the Lie bracket in any Lie algebra.\n\nVarious notations, like the vinculum have a similar effect to brackets in specifying order of operations, or otherwise grouping several characters together for a common purpose.\n\nIn the Z formal specification language, braces define a set and chevrons define a sequence.\n\nTraditionally in accounting, contra amounts are placed in parentheses. A debit balance account in a series of credit balances will have brackets and vice versa.\n\nBrackets are used in some countries in the citation of law reports to identify parallel citations to non-official reporters. For example: Chronicle Pub. Co. v. Superior Court, (1998) 54 Cal.2d 548, [7 Cal.Rptr. 109]. In some other countries (such as England and Wales), square brackets are used to indicate that the year is part of the citation and parentheses are used to indicate the year the judgment was given.

{"id": "4426607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4426607", "title": "Brick (electronics)", "text": "Brick (electronics)\n\nThe word \"brick\", when used in reference to consumer electronics, describes an electronic device such as a mobile device, game console, or router that, due to severe physical damage, a serious misconfiguration, corrupted firmware, or a hardware problem, can no longer function, hence, is as technologically useful as a brick.\n\nThe term derives from the vaguely rectangular shape of many electronic devices (and their detachable power supplies) and the suggestion that the device can function only as a lifeless, square object, paperweight or doorstop.\n\nThis term is commonly used as a verb. For example, \"I bricked my MP3 player when I tried to modify its firmware.\" It can also be used as a noun, for example, \"If it's corrupted and you apply using fastboot, your device is a brick.\"\n\nIn the common usage of the term, \"bricking\" suggests that the damage is so serious as to have rendered the device dead.\n\nBricking a device is usually a result of interrupting an attempt to update the device. Many devices have an update procedure which must not be interrupted before completion; if interrupted by a power failure, user intervention, or any other reason, the existing firmware may be partially overwritten and unusable. The risk of corruption can be minimized by taking all possible precautions against interruption.\n\nInstalling firmware with errors, or for a different revision of the hardware, or installing firmware incompetently patched such as DVD firmware which only plays DVDs sold in a particular region, can also cause bricking.\n\nDevices can also be bricked by malware (malicious software) and sometimes by running software not intentionally harmful but with errors that cause damage.\n\nSome devices include two copies of firmware, one active and the other stored in fixed ROM or writable non-volatile memory and not normally accessible to processes that could corrupt it, as well as a way to copy the stored firmware over the active version, even if corrupt, so that if the active firmware is damaged, it can be replaced by the copy and the device will not be bricked. Other devices have minimal \"bootloader\" firmware, enabled usually by operating a switch or jumper, which does not enable the device to work normally but can reload the main firmware.\n\nBricking is classified into two types, namely hard and soft, depending on the device's ability to function.\n\nHard bricked devices generally show little to no signs of life. A hard bricked device does not power on or show any vendor logo; in essence, the screen remains turned off. Some of the major reasons for hard bricking are installing firmware not made for the device, interrupted flashing procedure or following a flashing procedure incorrectly.\n\nSome other reasons include flashing a root file for a different file or using wrong commands. Some kernel bugs have been known that affect the \"/data\" partition in the eMMC chip, which gets corrupted during certain operations such as wiping and flashing.\n\nRecovering from a hard brick is generally considered difficult and requires the use of a more direct programming interface to the controller; such an interface exists as there must be a way to program the initial firmware on an unprogrammed device. However, additional tools or connections may be needed.\n\nApart from that, there are different stages of a bricked device. There are different steps to resolve this issue and this includes: Analyzing the problem, also needs some changes on the PC, analyzing the process, and at which stage the hard brick device is. \n\nA \"soft bricked\" device may show signs of life, but boots unsuccessfully or may display an error screen. Soft bricked devices can usually be fixed; for example, a soft bricked iOS device may display a screen instructing the user to plug it into a computer to perform an operating system recovery using iTunes software. In some cases, Soft bricked devices are unable to be repaired without physical repairs being carried out; an example of this would be an iOS device locked with iCloud Activation Lock, of which the only solution is to contact the owner of the iCloud account the device is locked to, or to replace the entire motherboard with a non-locked board.\n\nSome devices that become \"bricked\" because the contents of their nonvolatile memory are incorrect can be \"unbricked\" using separate hardware (a debug board) that accesses this memory directly. This is similar to the procedure for loading firmware into a new device when the memory is still empty. This kind of \"bricking\" and \"unbricking\" occasionally happens during firmware testing and development. In other cases software and hardware procedures, often complex, have been developed that have a good chance of unbricking the device. There is no general method; each device is different. There are also user-created modifier programs to use on bricked or partially bricked devices to make them functional. Examples include the Wiibrew program BootMii used to fix semi-bricked Nintendo Wiis, the Odin program used to flash firmware on Samsung android devices, or the fastboot Android protocol which is capable of reflashing a device with no software installed.\n\nA soft bricked rooted Kindle Fire can be unbricked by using unrooting tools.\n\nA personal computer may be unbricked by using System Restore or backup.\n\nIn principle any device with rewritable firmware, or certain crucial settings stored into flash or EEPROM memory, can be bricked. Many, but not all, devices with user-updatable firmware have protection against bricking; devices intended to be updated only by official service personnel generally do not.\n\nAmongst devices known to have bricking issues are: older PCs (more recent models often have dual BIOSes or some other form of protection), many mobile phones, handheld game consoles like the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS, video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, many SCSI devices and some lines of hard disk drives and routers.\n\nAt least some older consumer market router models can become unresponsive when the user tries to define a subnet mask that does not contain one contiguous run of 1s and then 0s. If even a single bit is set so that it breaks one of the runs, the router may become bricked, unresponsive to any standard troubleshooting or resolving procedures listed in the manual. Unbricking the router may require opening the case, shorting some jumper pins on the board, then connecting the router by the USB cable to an old PC with USB 1.1 hardware, running a special DOS level program supplied by the manufacturer, and powering the router up. This procedure will flash the router to factory settings and original firmware.\n\nElectric cars such as the Tesla Roadster (2008) can brick if the battery is completely discharged.\n\nSometimes an interrupted flash upgrade of a PC motherboard will brick the board, for example, due to a power outage (or user impatience) during the upgrade process. It is sometimes possible to unbrick such a motherboard, by scavenging a similar but otherwise broken board for a BIOS chip in the hopes that the BIOS will work even halfway, far enough to boot from floppy. Then it will be possible to retry the flash process. Sometimes it is possible to boot from a floppy, then swap the old presumably dead BIOS chip in and reflash it. On some Gigabyte boards, it can also be possible to reflash the bricked main BIOS using a backup BIOS. Some vendors put the BIOS chip in sockets, allowing the corrupted BIOS chip to be removed and reprogrammed using an external tool, like a universal programmer or an Arduino.\n\nMany newer systems capable of accessing online services (such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and iPhone) have internal hardware-based unique identifiers, allowing individual systems to be tracked over a network and banned from accessing certain online services. Banned systems usually continue to operate for purposes unrelated to the online service, but they are often considered \"bricked\" by users of the online service.\n\nMobile telephones have a fixed identification code, the IMEI; a telephone reported stolen can have its IMEI blocked by networks—effectively bricked—although anyone with the necessary expertise and equipment can usually change the IMEI.\n\nIn 2011, US Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) proposed that phones be \"bricked\" when reported stolen. Some local police chiefs agreed. However, in 2013, this was rejected by mobile carriers because \"If created, this capability would be in every handset and the 'kill' message would be known to every operator and therefore could not be kept secret,\" which could be an issue if it fell into the hands of someone with malicious intent.\n"}
{"id": "1458751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1458751", "title": "Celtiberian script", "text": "Celtiberian script\n\nThe Celtiberian script is a Paleohispanic script that was the main writing system of the Celtiberian language, an extinct Continental Celtic language, which was also occasionally written using the Latin alphabet. This script is a direct adaptation of the northeastern Iberian script, the most frequently used of the Iberian scripts.\n\nAll the Paleohispanic scripts, with the exception of the Greco-Iberian alphabet, share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic values for the stop consonants, and monophonemic values for the rest of consonants and vowels. They are thus to be classed as neither alphabets nor syllabaries; rather, they are mixed scripts normally identified as semi-syllabaries. There is no agreement about how the Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries originated; some researchers conclude that they derive only from the Phoenician alphabet, while others believe the Greek alphabet was also involved.\n\nThe basic Celtiberian signary contains 26 signs rather than the 28 signs of the original model, the northeastern Iberian script, since the Celtiberians omitted one of the two rhotic and one of the three nasals. The remaining 26 signs comprised 5 vowels, 15 syllabic signs and 6 consonants (one lateral, two sibilants, one rhotic and two nasals). The sign equivalent to Iberian \"s\" is transcribed as \"z\" in Celtiberian, because it is assumed that it sometimes expresses the fricative result of an ancient dental stop (\"d\"), while the Iberian sign \"ś\" is transcribed as \"s\". As for the use of the nasal signs, there are two variants of the Celtiberian script: In the eastern variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign \"ḿ\", while in the western variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign \"m\". This is interpreted as evidence of a double origin of the Celtiberian script. Like one variant of the northeastern Iberian script, the western variant of Celtiberian shows evidence of having allowed the voiced stops \"g\" and \"d\" to be differentiated from their respective voiceless counterparts, \"k\" and \"t\", by adding a stroke to the voiceless signs. This is known as the ‘dual system’ in Paleohispanic scripts, which otherwise do not distinguish between pairs of voiceless and voiced stops (\"p:b, t:d\" and \"k:g\").\n\nThe Celtiberian inscriptions have been found mainly in the Ebro valley and near the sources of the Tagus and Douro rivers, where Roman and Greek sources place the Celtiberian people. The Celtiberian inscriptions were made on different types of objects (silver and bronze coins, ceramic receptacles, bronze plaques and tesseras, amphores, stones, spindle-whorls, etc.). There are just under two hundred surviving inscriptions, one of which is exceptionally long: the third Botorrita bronze plaque (Zaragoza) with more than three thousand signs containing a census of nearly 250 people. Almost always the direction of the writing is left to right. The fact that nearly all the Celtiberian inscriptions were found out of archaeological context does not allow a precise chronology to be established, but it seems that the earliest inscriptions in the Celtiberian script date from the 2nd century BCE while the latest ones date from the 1st century BCE.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2211169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211169", "title": "Cratylus (dialogue)", "text": "Cratylus (dialogue)\n\nCratylus (; , \"Kratylos\") is the name of a dialogue by Plato. Most modern scholars agree that it was written mostly during Plato's so-called middle period. In the dialogue, Socrates is asked by two men, Cratylus and Hermogenes, to tell them whether names are \"conventional\" or \"natural\", that is, whether language is a system of arbitrary signs or whether words have an intrinsic relation to the things they signify.\n\nThe individual Cratylus was the first intellectual influence on Plato (Sedley). Aristotle states that Cratylus influenced Plato by introducing to him the teachings of Heraclitus, according to MW. Riley.\n\nThe subject of Cratylus is \"the correctness of names\" (περὶ ὀνομάτων ὀρθότητος), in other words, it is a critique on the subject of naming (Baxter).\n\nWhen discussing a ὄνομα (\"\" ) and how it would relate to its subject, Socrates compares the original creation of a word to the work of an artist. An artist uses color to express the essence of his subject in a painting. In much the same way, the creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word's subject. There is a letter that is best for soft things, one for liquid things, and so on. He comments;\n\nOne countering position, held by Hermogenes, is that names have come about due to custom and convention. They do not express the essence of their subject, so they can be swapped with something unrelated by the individuals or communities who use them.\n\nThe line between the two perspectives is often blurred. During more than half of the dialogue, Socrates makes guesses at Hermogenes' request as to where names and words have come from. These include the names of the Olympian gods, personified deities, and many words that describe abstract concepts. He examines whether, for example, giving names of \"streams\" to Cronus and Rhea (\"Ροή\" – flow or space) are purely accidental.\n\nThe Greek term \"ῥεῦμα\" may refer to the flow of any medium and is not restricted to the flow of water or liquids. Many of the words which Socrates uses as examples may have come from an idea originally linked to the name, but have changed over time. Those of which he cannot find a link, he often assumes have come from foreign origins or have changed so much as to lose all resemblance to the original word. He states, \"names have been so twisted in all manner of ways, that I should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue.\"\n\nThe final theory of relations between name and object named is posited by Cratylus, a disciple of Heraclitus, who believes that names arrive from divine origins, making them necessarily correct. Socrates rebukes this theory by reminding Cratylus of the imperfection of certain names in capturing the objects they seek to signify. From this point, Socrates ultimately rejects the study of language, believing it to be philosophically inferior to a study of things themselves.\n\nAn extensive section of Plato's dialogue \"Cratylus\" is devoted to the etymology of the god's name, in which Socrates is arguing for a folk etymology not from \"unseen\" but from \"his knowledge (\"eidenai\") of all noble things\". The origin of Hades' name is uncertain, but has generally been seen as meaning \"The Unseen One\" since antiquity. Modern linguists have proposed the Proto-Greek form *\"Awides\" (\"unseen\"). The earliest attested form is \"Aḯdēs\" (), which lacks the proposed digamma. West argues instead for an original meaning of \"the one who presides over meeting up\" from the universality of death.\n\nThe sound was lost at various times in various dialects, mostly before the classical period.\n\nIn Ionic, had probably disappeared before Homer's epics were written down (7th century BC), but its former presence can be detected in many cases because its omission left the meter defective. For example, the words ἄναξ \"(tribal) king, lord, (military) leader\". found in the Iliad, would have originally been (and is attested in this form in Mycenaean Greek), and \"wine\" are sometimes used in the meter where a word starting with a consonant would be expected. Further evidence coupled with cognate-analysis shows that was earlier (cf. Cretan Doric \"ibêna\", cf. Latin \"vīnum\" and English \"wine\").\n\n\nAlthough these are clear examples of onomatopoeia, Socrates's statement that words are not musical imitations of the nature suggests that Plato didn't believe that language itself generates from sound words.\n\nPlato's theory of forms also makes an appearance. For example, no matter what a hammer is made out of, it is still called a \"hammer\", and thus is the \"form\" of a hammer:\nSocrates: So mustn't a rule-setter also know how to embody in sounds and syllables the name naturally suited to each thing? And if he is to be an authentic giver of names, mustn't he, in making and giving each name, look to what a name itself is? And if different rule-setters do not make each name out of the same syllables, we mustn't forget that different blacksmiths, who are making the same tool for the same type of work, don't all make it out of the same iron. But as long as they give it the same form--even if that form is embodied in different iron--the tool will be correct, whether it is made in Greece or abroad. Isn't that so?\n\nPlato's theory of forms again appears at 439c, when Cratylus concedes the existence of \"a beautiful itself, and a good itself, and the same for each one of the things that are\".\n\nAn early translation was made by *Thomas Taylor in 1804.\n\nThe I.Bekker edition was published 1826 (London) under the heading \"Platonis Scripta Graece Omnia\".\n\nA translation was made by H. N. Fowler and published during 1926 under Loeb Classical Library by Harvard University Press.\n\n\n"}

Its speech area is off the coast of Massawa, on three islands in the Dahlak Archipelago: Dahlak Kebir, Nora, and Dehil.\n\nDahalik belongs to the Afro-Asiatic family's Semitic branch, a member of the Northern branch of the Ethiopic group, and is closely related to Tigre and Tigrinya. It is said to be not mutually intelligible with Tigre and, according to Simeone-Senelle, is sufficiently different to be considered a separate language. However, there are those who disagree.\n\nDahalik is spoken on the Dahlak Archipelago, an island group belonging to Eritrea in the Red Sea. On the archipelago, most people are speakers of Dahalik with smaller populations of Arabic and Afar native speakers. The situation is different for every village: Durrubishet and Dasquo have almost universal use of Dahalik, while other villages have a greater mix of languages. Most islanders are multilingual in Dahalik, Arabic, and Afar, while the language of education is Arabic. Most Dahalik men have regular contact with Arabic, Tigre, and Afar, and any mixed marriages usually result in the children learning two mother tongues. Dahalik speakers also consider their language to be a mix of Arabic, Tigre, and a small amount of Tigrinya. Overall, there are only a few elderly monolingual speakers of Dahalik.

{"id": "20734871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20734871", "title": "Dalpatram", "text": "Dalpatram\n\nDalpatram Dahyabhai Travadi () (1820-1898) was a Gujarati language poet during 19th century in India. He was the father of Nanalal Dalpatram Kavi, a poet.\n\nDalpatram was born on 21 January 1820 at Wadhwan city of Surendranagar district in a Brahmin family. Dalpatram grew up to the resonant chanting of 'mantras' and recitations of religious scriptures. He was a child prodigy and displayed his extraordinary literary skills by composing 'hondulas' at the age of 12. He mastered the structures of rhyme, poesis and 'Vrajbhasha' as a Swaminarayan devotee under Brahmanand Swami, and later moved to Ahmedabad at the age of 24.\n\nDalpatram died on 25 March 1898 at Ahmedabad.\n\nDalpatram was a Sanskrit scholar and poet.\nDalpatram taught Gujarati language to Alexander Kinloch Forbes, a British colonial administrator to Ahmedabad. Gujarati was considered at the bottom of language hierarchy during those times, so he preferred to write his poems in Brijbhasha instead of Gujarati, his mother tongue. Forbes encouraged him to write in Gujarati. Forbes and Dalpatram became close friends, and he inspired Dalpatram to write \"Laxmi Natak\" published in 1849, the first play in Gujarati, based on Greek drama Plutus. \n\nForbes, who wanted Gujarati literature to develop, had helped start the Gujarat Vernacular Society. He served as its first assistant secretary and started the \"Buddhiprakash\" periodical in 1850, editing it until 1878. When Forbes died in 1865, Dalpatram composed \"Farbesvirah\", a Gujarati elegy, and \"Farbesvilas\", his account of the gathering of bards, both dedicated to him. At the end of the 19th Century He was entitled \"Mahakavi\" (Great Poet) by Shahjanand Swami, the founder of Swaminarayan Sampraday.\n\nUnlike Narmad, another prominent Gujarati poet of the same period, Dalpatram supported British rule for the benefits it gave India. Dalpatram also supported social reforms such as opposition to child marriage and allowing widows to remarry. Both Dalpatram and Narmad were the first Gujarati poets to address subjects connected to common life in their verses. Dalpatram's poems had subjects like English law, how to write an essay, and even \"trees in a college compound\". His verse often reflected his sense of humour.\n\nDalpatram was an authority on meters and wrote a treatise, \"Pingal\" (\"Prosody\"), which was used by scholars as a source book for many decades.\n\nIn tribute to Dalpatram's work, AMC and citizens of Ahmedabad proposed a memorial at the site of his house, which was destroyed in 1985. With very few references or photographs available, it was very difficult to recreate the house. References were taken from the memories of residents and the architectural design of surrounding houses to create a memorial in the form of facade of the house and statue of Kavi Dalpatram in the year 2001.\n\nIn the year 2001, the memorial became a part of Heritage walk of Ahmedabad.\nThe design of statue was debated before they came up with the idea of Kavi in sitting posture with a book in his lap.\n\nThe statue is made of bronze and weighs 120 kg. Another key feature of the statue is the empty shoe of Kavi which is very dear to the children. The children call him 'Dada' or grandfather with love and have deep emotions attached to the statue.\n\nThe platform behind the statue displays the plan of the original house.The yellow stone on the floor indicates the walls, grey stone indicates the rooms and the black stone represents the open courtyard. The staircase is also marked with yellow stone.\n\nThe memorial also serves as a platform for community gatherings. His plays and recitations are also enthusiastically performed on various occasions including his birthday. The Heritage department has taken the responsibility of maintenance of the Dalpatram Memorial.\n\nHe was a progressive thinker and advocated the upliftment of oppressed classes and women's empowerment. He used his literary skills to bring about changes in society. At the end of the 19th century, he was entitled Mahakavi or the great poet by Shahjanand Swami, the founder of the Swaminarayan Sampraday.\n\nYears have passed but the poems of Mahakavi still resonate in the hearts of people, inspiring them to move ahead in life, bringing peace to disturbed minds and questioning the social structure and system. Dada's poems also aim to teach moral values to the children through rich imagery and simple language.\n\nThe Kavishwar Dalpatram Award is named after him.\n\nHis career spanned 6 books and 25 awards including drama, poems, songs, essays and articles. 'Hari Lila Amrut', 'Ven Charitra', 'Mithyabhiman' and 'Laxmi' are his major contributions.\n\n\n"}

A family deviating from this model is considered a nontraditional family. However, in most cultures at most times, the extended family model has been most common, not the nuclear family, and the nuclear family became the most common form in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nSeveral well-known online dictionaries define \"family values\" as the following:\n\nFamilialism or \"familism\" is the ideology that puts priority on family and family values. Familialism prioritizes the needs of the family over the needs of individuals, and advocates for a welfare system where families, rather than the government, take responsibility for the care of their members.\n\nIn the United States, the banner of \"family values\" has been used by conservatives to fight abortion, gay rights, and major feminist objectives in politics.\n\nInterpretations of Islamic learnings and Arab culture are common for the majority of Saudis. Islam is a driving cultural force that dictates a submission to the will of God. The academic literature suggests that the family is regarded as the main foundation of Muslim society and culture; the family structure and nature of the relationship between family members are influenced by the Islamic religion. Marriage in Saudi culture means the union of two families, not just two individuals. In Muslim society, marriage involves a social contract that occurs with the consent of parents or guardians. Furthermore, marriage is considered the only legitimate outlet for sexual desires, and sex outside marriage (fornication) is a crime that is punished under Islamic law. This view of marriage is similar to the Western Christian view of marriage, created in 12th century France, which promised salvation, sex without sin, and much more.\n\nThe Saudi family includes extended families, as the extended family provides the individual with a sense of identity. The father is often the breadwinner and protector of the family, whereas the mother is often the homemaker and the primary caretaker of the children. Parents are regarded with high respect, and children are strongly encouraged to respect and obey their parents. Often, families provide care for elders. Until recently, because families and friends are expected to provide elderly care, nursing homes were considered culturally unacceptable.\n\nIn sociological terms, nontraditional families make up the majority of American households. As of 2014, only 46% of children in the U.S. live in a traditional family, down from 61% in 1980. This number includes only families with parents who are in their first marriage, whereas the percentage of children simply living with two married parents is 65% as of 2016. However, there are many who hold that the nuclear family is the fabric that holds society together and work to promote stronger family values. The Chemin Neuf community, the Bruderhof, and the Evangelical Alliance all work to promote the nuclear family.\n\n\n\n"}

Differences of opinion on matters of sexuality deeply polarized the feminist movement, particularly leading feminist thinkers, in the late 1970s and early 1980s and continue to influence debate amongst feminists to this day. \n\nThe sides were characterized by anti-porn feminist and sex-positive feminist groups with disagreements regarding sexuality, including pornography, erotica, prostitution, lesbian sexual practices, the role of trans women in the lesbian community, sadomasochism and other sexual issues. The feminist movement was deeply divided as a result of these debates. Many historians view the feminist sex wars as having been the end of the second-wave feminist era (which began 1963) as well as the herald of the third wave (which began in the early 1990s).\n\nThe two sides became labelled anti-pornography feminists and sex-positive feminists.\n\nIn 1976 Andrea Dworkin organized demonstrations against the film \"Snuff \"in New York, but attempts to start an organization to continue the feminist anti-pornography campaign failed. Efforts were more successful in Los Angeles, where Women Against Violence Against Women was founded in response to \"Snuff \"in 1976; they campaigned against the Rolling Stones' 1976 album \"Black and Blue\". The U.S. anti-pornography movement gained ground with the founding of Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media (WAVPM) in 1977 in San Francisco, following a 1976 conference on violence against women held by local women's centers. Early members included Susan Griffin, Kathleen Barry, and Laura Lederer. \n\nWAVPM organised the first national conference on pornography in San Francisco in 1978 which included the first Take Back the Night march. The conference led to anti-pornography feminists organizing in New York in 1979 under the banner of Women Against Pornography (WAP), and to similar organizations and efforts being created across the United States. In 1983, Page Mellish, a one-time member of WAVPM and of WAP, founded Feminists Fighting Pornography to focus on political activism seeking legal changes to limit the porn industry. Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon wanted civil laws restricting pornography and to this end drafted the Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance, also known as the \"Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance\".\n\nFrom 1979 feminist journalist Ellen Willis was one of the early voices criticizing anti-pornography feminists for what she saw as sexual puritanism, moral authoritarianism and a threat to free speech. Her 1981 essay, \"Lust Horizons: Is the Women's Movement Pro-Sex?\" is the origin of the term, \"pro-sex feminism\". The response to the anti-pornography strand of feminism by the sex-positive feminists was one that promoted sex as an avenue of pleasure for women, seeing anti-pornography positions as aligned to the political right-wing's war on recreational sex and pornography. Early sex positive groups included Samois, founded in San Francisco in 1978, whose early members included Gayle Rubin and Pat Califia, and the Lesbian Sex Mafia, founded by Dorothy Allison and Jo Arnone in New York in 1981. The Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce (FACT) was set up in 1984 by Ellen Willis in response to the Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance, in 1989 Feminists Against Censorship formed in the UK, its members including Avedon Carol and Feminists for Free Expression formed in the USA in 1992 with founding members including Veronica Vera and Candida Royalle.\n\nIn October 1980 the National Organization for Women identified what became known as the \"Big Four\" through declaring that \"Pederasty, pornography, sadomasochism and public sex\" were about \"exploitation, violence or invasion of privacy\" and not \"sexual preference or orientation\". One of the more memorable clashes between the pro-sex and anti-porn feminists occurred at the 1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality. Anti-pornography feminists were excluded from the events’ planning committee, so they staged rallies outside the conference to show their disdain.\n\nThe two sides of the feminist sex wars clashed over a number of issues, resulting in intense debates held both in person and in various media.\n\nToward the end of the 1970s, much of the discourse in the feminist movement shifted from the discussion of lesbian feminism to focus on the new topic of sexuality. One of the primary concerns with sexuality was the issue of pornography, which caused a great divide among feminists. The two recognized sides of the debate were anti-pornography feminism and \"pro-sex\" feminism. One of the major influences of anti-pornography feminism was its predecessor, lesbian feminism. Anti-pornography movements developed from fundamental arguments displayed by lesbianism, such as the notion of patriarchal sexual relations. Ellen Willis described these relations as being \"based on male power backed by force.\" From this perspective, pornography is created exclusively for men by men and is a direct reflection of the man-dominant paradigm surrounding sexual relations. Another idea taken from lesbian feminism by anti-pornography groups was that sexuality is about creating a compassionate bond and a lasting relation with another person, contrary to the belief of the purely physical nature of sex.\n\nIn her book, \"Pornography: Men Possessing Women\", Andrea Dworkin argued that the theme of pornography is male dominance and as a result it is intrinsically harmful to women and their well-being. Dworkin believed that pornography is not only damaging in its production but also in its consumption, since the viewer will mentally internalize pornography's misogynistic portrayal of women. Robin Morgan summarized the view of anti-pornography feminists that pornography and violence against women are linked in her statement, \"pornography is the theory, rape is the practice\".\n\nThe anti-pornography movement has been criticised by sex-positive feminists as a repression of sexuality and a move towards censorship. In her article, \"Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality\", Gayle Rubin characterizes sex liberation as a feminist goal and denounces the idea that anti-pornography feminists speak collectively for all of feminism. She offers the notion that what is needed is a theory of sexuality separate from feminism. In \"XXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography\", Wendy McElroy summarizes the sex-positive perspective as \"the benefits pornography provides to women far outweigh any of its disadvantages\".\n\nThe pornography debate among radical and libertarian feminists has focused on the depictions of female sexuality in relation to male sexuality in this type of media. Radical feminists emphasize that pornography illustrates objectification and normalization of sexual violence through presentation of specific acts. In contrast, libertarian feminists are concerned with the stigmatization of sexual minorities and the limited right to practice sexual choice that would be hindered without pornography.\n\nThe main locus of the sex wars' debate on sadomasochism and other BDSM practices was San Francisco. Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media was founded there in 1977. Its first political action was to picket a live show at a strip club featuring women performing sadomasochistic acts on each other, in line with its stated aim to end all portrayals of women being \"bound, raped, tortured, killed or degraded for sexual stimulation or pleasure\". As well as campaigning against pornography, WAVPM were also strongly opposed to BDSM, seeing it as ritualized violence against women and opposed its practice within the lesbian community. In 1978 SAMOIS was formed, an organization for women in the BDSM community who saw their sexual practices as consistent with feminist principles. Several black lesbian feminists have written on this topic, including Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, Darlene Pagano, Karen Sims, and Rose Mason, condemning sadomasochism as an often racist practice, insensitive to the black female experience. \n\nAnother debate of the feminist sex wars centered on prostitution. The women in the anti-pornography camp argued against prostitution, claiming it is forced on women who have no other alternatives. Meanwhile, sex-positive feminists argued that this position ignored the self-agency of women who chose sex work, viewing prostitution as not inherently based on the exploitation of women. Carol Leigh notes that \"The Prostitutes rights movement of the early 1970s evolved directly from the women's movement\", but adds: \"The women's movement in the U.S. has always been ambivalent about prostitutes\". The polarized views of feminists on prostitution have affected their positions on the related issue of human trafficking, which is frequently for the purpose of sexual exploitation, with anti-prostitution feminists taking up the position of abolitionists and sex-positive feminists that of regulationists.\n\nThe polarization of feminist ideology during the sex wars has had wide-ranging effects. Examples include, according to Liu (2011), \"The confusion in the interpretation of the definition of human trafficking is a consequence of opposing feminist views on prostitution.\"\n\nThird-wave feminist writings promote personal, individualized views on the gender-related issues focused on during the feminist sex wars, such as prostitution, pornography and sadomasochism. In particular, the third-wave view of pornography is that there is no greater meaning other than which the actor or consumer gives it. Items such as sex objects and porn, identified by some second-wave feminists as instruments of oppression are now no longer being exclusively used by men but also by women. Feminist critic Teresa de Lauretis sees the sex wars not in terms of polarized sides but as reflecting a third wave feminism inherently embodying difference, which may include conflicting and competing drives. Meanwhile, critic Jana Sawicki rejects both the polarized positions, seeking a third way that is neither morally dogmatic or uncritically libertarian.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14223847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14223847", "title": "Gestures in language acquisition", "text": "Gestures in language acquisition\n\nGestures are a form of non-verbal communication that include movements of the hands, arms, and/or other parts of the body. Children can use gesture to communicate before they have the ability to use spoken words and phrases. In this way gestures can prepare children to learn a spoken language, creating a bridge from pre-verbal communication to speech. The onset of gesture has also been shown to predict and facilitate children's spoken language acquisition. Once children begin to use spoken words their gestures can be used in conjunction with these words to form phrases and eventually to express thoughts and complement vocalized ideas.\n\nGestures not only complement language development but also enhance the child’s ability to communicate. Gestures allow the child to convey a message or thought that they would not be able to easily express using their limited vocabulary. Children's gestures are classified into different categories occurring in different stages of development. The categories of children's gesture include deictic and representational gestures.\n\nGestures are distinct from manual signs in that they do not belong to a complete language system. For example, pointing through the extension of a body part, especially the index finger to indicate interest in an object is a widely used gesture that is understood by many cultures On the other hand, manual signs are conventionalized—they are gestures that have become a lexical element in a language. A good example of manual signing is American Sign Language (ASL)–when individuals communicate via ASL, their signs have meanings that are equivalent to words (e.g., two people communicating using ASL both understand that forming a fist with your right hand and rotating this fist using clockwise motions on the chest carries the lexical meaning of the word \"sorry\").\n\nTypically, the first gestures children show around 10 to 12 months of age are deictic gestures. These gestures are also known as pointing where children extend their index finger, although any other body part could also be used, to single out an object of interest. Deictic gestures occur across cultures and indicate that infants are aware of what other people pay attention to. Pre-verbal children use pointing for many different reasons, such as responding to or answering questions and/or sharing their interests and knowledge with others.\n\nThere are three main functions to infant's pointing:\n\nThe existence of deictic gestures that are declarative and epistemic in nature reflects another important part of children's development, the development of joint visual attention. Joint visual attention occurs when a child and an adult are both paying attention to the same object. Joint attention through the use of pointing is considered a precursor to speech development because it reveals that children want to communicate with another person. Furthermore, the amount of pointing at 12 months old predicts speech production and comprehension rates at 24 months old.\n\nOnce children can produce spoken words they often use deictic gestures to create sentence-like phrases. These phrases occur when a child, for example, says the word \"eat\" and then points to a cookie. The incidence of these gesture-word combinations predicts the transition from one-word to two-word speech. This shows that gesture can maximize the communicative opportunities that children can have before their speech is fully developed facilitating their entrance into lexical and syntactic development.\n\nRepresentational gesture refers to an object, person, location, or event with hand movement, body movement, or facial expression. Representational gestures can be divided into iconic and conventional gestures. Unlike deictic gestures, representational gestures communicate a specific meaning. Children start to produce representational gestures at 10 to 24 months of age. Young American children will produce more deictic gestures than representational gestures, but Italian children will produce almost equal amounts of representational and deictic gestures.\n\nIconic gestures have visually similar relationship to the action, object, or attribute they portray. There is an increase in iconic gesturing after the two-word utterance stage at 26 months. Children are able to create novel iconic gestures when they were attempting to inform the listener of information they think the listener does not know. Iconic gestures aided language development after the two-word utterance stage, whereas deictic gestures did not. Iconic gestures are the most common form of representational gesture in Italian children. Children will copy the iconic gestures they see their parents using, therefore including iconic gestures when measuring representational vocabularies increases Italian children's vocabularies. Even though the Italian children produced more iconic gestures, the two-word utterance stage did not arrive earlier than American children who produce fewer iconic gestures.\n\nConventional gestures are culture-bound emblems that do not translate across different cultures. Culture-specific gestures such as shaking your head \"no\" or waving \"goodbye\" are considered conventional gestures. Although American children do not typically produce many representational gestures in general, conventional gestures are the most frequently used in the representational gesture category.\n\nLike most developmental timelines it is important to consider that no two children develop at the same pace. Infant gesture is thought to be an important part of the prelinguistic period and prepares a child for the emergence of language. It has been suggested that language and gesture develop in interaction with one another. It is believed that gestures are easier to produce for both infants and adults; this is supported by the fact that infants begin to communicate with gestures before they can produce words. The first type of gestures that appear in infants are deictic gestures. Deictic gestures include pointing, which is often the most common gesture produced at ten months of age. At eleven months of age children can produce a sequence of 2 gestures, usually a deictic gesture with a conventional or representational gesture. and by twelve months of age children can begin to produce 3-gestures in sequence usually a representational or conventional gesture that is preceded and followed by a deictic gesture. Around twelve months of age, infants begin to use representational gestures. In relation to language acquisition, representational gestures appear around the same time as first words. At age 18 months children produce more deictic gestures than representational gestures. Between the first and second year of life, children begin to learn more words and use gestures less. At 26 months of age, there is an increase in iconic gesture use and comprehension. Gestures become more complex as children get older. Between age 4-6 children can use whole body gestures when describing a route. A whole body gesture occurs in three-dimensional space and is used when the speaker is describing a route as if they are on it. At ages 5–6, children also describe a route from a bird's eye view and use representational gestures from this point of view. The ways in which gestures are used are an indication of the developmental or conceptual ability of children.\n\nNot only do gestures play an important role in the natural development of spoken language, but they also are a major factor in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). AAC refers to the methods, tools, and theories to use non-standard linguistic forms of communication by and with individuals without or with limited functional speech. Means used to communicate in AAC can span from high-tech computer-based communication devices, to low-tech means such as one-message switches, to non-tech means such as picture cards, manual signs, and gestures. It is only within the last two decades that the importance of gestures in the cognitive and linguistic development processes has been examined, and in particular the gesture's functionality for individuals with communication disorders, especially AAC users.\n\n"}

In the United States, after accumulating enough sea time in a qualified rating, taking required training courses, and completing on-board assessments, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a license as a Third Mate or Third Assistant Engineer. If approved the applicant must then pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license.\n\nA ship’s hawsepipe is the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the anchor chain passes through. Hawsepiper refers to climbing up the hawsepipe, a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. This is in turn derived from the traditional British Naval usage of \"came up through the hawsehole\", referring to sailors who first entered the ship as foremast jacks before becoming officers, metaphorically by climbing up the hawser without great honor or respect, rather than being received directly onto the quarterdeck.\nThere is also the phrase, \"going down the hawse pipe\" which is an officer who cannot find a ship's billet and signs on as an ordinary seaman or wiper.\nSeveral offer their membership the required training to help them advance. Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training.\n\nSince the requirements of STCW '95 have been enacted there have been complaints that the hawsepiper progression path has been made too difficult because of the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements. These critics assert that the newer requirements will eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States.\n\nThe U.S. military rough equivalent to this term is mustang.\n\n"}
{"id": "16200722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16200722", "title": "Hobyót language", "text": "Hobyót language\n\nHobyot (Arabic: لغة هوبيوت , also known as Hewbyót, Habyot, or Hobi) is one of the six Modern South Arabian languages (MSAL), a group of South Semitic languages spoken in the southern Arabian Peninsula. A severely-endangered Semitic language on the verge of extinction, it is spoken in a small area between Yemen and neighboring Oman. The speaking population is estimated to be about 1000 in Oman and 40 in Yemen, though the true number may be less.\n\nIts usage is less associated with a specific community or tribe of people, and more related to the geographical area in which it is spoken (the mountainous Dhufar/Yemen border). Much of the information regarding Hobyot's existence originated through the study of the more dominant, neighboring Modern South Arabian languages like Mehri and Jibbali. A clear linguistic description of Hobyot is difficult, as many speakers mix Mehri into their speech around outsiders.\n\nIn recent years, individual studies of Hobyot have provided sufficient evidence to prove its linguistic independence, and have given insight into the history and culture of its speakers. Documentation of its complete structure, however, has yet to be completed.\n\nLinguists first mentioned Hobyot in 1981 with a publication done by Thomas Muir Johnstone, though he initially discovered it in the 1970s. Johnstone hypothesized that it was actually a fusion of the more popular Mehri and Jibbali dialects of the MSAL rather than a definitive language in its own right. It would not be distinguished as its own language until 1985, when Marie-Claude Simeone-Sinelle published enough evidence to reveal distinction from its MSAL counterparts. It is now widely understood that a sufficient number of individual linguistic features has proved Hobyot's independence as its own language.\n\nSome believe that Hobyot speakers consider their language to be a mixture of Shahri and Mehri. More documentation of the language is anticipated to arrive in the near future, as two modern research groups from the UK and France have been conducting field work in the hopes of shedding greater light on its nature.\n\nA preliminary detailing of some phonological and grammatical differences between Hobyot can be found in works done by Simeone-Senelle; specifically, in her work on its usage in Yemen and Oman.\n\nGiven its location at the border of two countries, Hobyot is the shared language of people of differing origins. While speakers are mostly found on both sides of the mountainous border between Yemen and Oman, some can be found in desert areas to the north and west, as well as fishing communities on the coast. The misinterpretation of Hobyot as a part of either Mehri or Jibbali may stem from the fact that most Hobyot speakers came into contact with Jibbali speakers in the mountains, and Mahra speakers in the deserts and coastal areas.\n\nHobyot speakers identify with the Mahra (Mehri) tribe, according to Hetzron's book on the Semitic languages. They are located within the Mehri area. In the mountains, they breed camels, cows, and goats, while escaping in caves and settlements of roundhouses during the monsoons.\n\nMost Hobyot speakers along the coasts are multilingual, and often have some understanding of Mehri or Mehriyot, even if they are not fluent. Influence by either Jibbali, Mehri, or Mehriyot depends upon linguistic proximity. For example, Hobyot spoken in Yemen is closer to Mehriyot on the coast and Jibbali in the mountains.\n\nHobyot is considered a critically endangered language. The actual number of speakers is unknown, but it is estimated to be only a few hundred. Most of those who maintain the language are elderly, which adds to the likelihood that language extinction is near.\n\nEthnologue categorizes it as a moribund language (EGIDS 8a). The only fluent speakers that are left are older than the child-bearing age, which ultimately makes integration of the language into subsequent generations highly improbable. Mechanisms of transmission would have to be created from outside the community in order to preserve it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "256135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256135", "title": "Indian English", "text": "Indian English\n\nIndian English refers to dialects of the English language characteristic of the Republic of India. The Constitution of India designates the co-official language of the Government of India as English, along with Hindi. Today many regional varieties of English, or Englishes, exist around the globe and are slowly but steadily gaining recognition.\n\nHindi is the official language of the Union Government of India. However, even after 70 years of Indian Independence from Britain, English is still retained with a status of the \"subsidiary\" official language. Only a few hundred thousand Indians, or less than 0.1% of the total population, have English as their first language.\n\nAccording to the 2001 Census, 12.6% of Indians know English. An analysis of the 2001 Census of India concluded that approximately 86 million Indians reported English as their second language, and another 39 million reported it as their third language. No data were available whether these individuals were English speakers or users.\n\nAccording to the 2005 India Human Development Survey, of the 41,554 surveyed, households reported that 72% of men (29,918) did not speak any English, 28% (11,635) spoke at least some English, and 5% (2,077, roughly 17.9% of those who spoke at least some English) spoke fluent English. Among women, the corresponding percentages were 83% (34,489) speaking no English, 17% (7,064) speaking at least some English, and 3% (1,246, roughly 17.6% of those who spoke at least some English) speaking English fluently. According to statistics of District Information System for Education (DISE) of National University of Educational Planning and Administration under Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, enrollment in English-medium schools increased by 50% between 2008–09 and 2013–14. The number of English-medium school students in India increased from over 15 million in 2008–09 to 29 million by 2013–14.\n\nIndia ranks 22 out of 72 countries in the 2016 EF English Proficiency Index published by the EF Education First. The index gives the country a score of 57.30 indicating \"moderate proficiency\". India ranks 4th out of 19 Asian countries included in the index. Among Asian countries, Singapore (63.52), Malaysia (60.70) and the Philippines (60.33) received higher scores than India.\n\nEnglish, according to the Indian Constitution, is the language of the Supreme Court and all the High Courts of India. The legal system in India is based on British Common Law. The Indian parliament has the power to change this law, but it has yet to do so. However, in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan there is use of Hindi in courts because of Presidential approval. In 2018, the Punjab and Haryana High Court also await Presidential approval for Hindi use as well.\n\nIndian English generally uses the Indian numbering system. Idiomatic forms derived from Indian literary languages and vernaculars have been absorbed into Indian English. Nevertheless, there remains general homogeneity in phonetics, vocabulary, and phraseology between various dialects of Indian English.\n\nEnglish language public instruction began in India in the 1830s during the rule of the East India Company (India was then, and is today, one of the most linguistically diverse regions of the world). In 1835, English replaced Persian as the official language of the Company. Lord Macaulay played a major role in introducing English and western concepts to education in India. He supported the replacement of Persian by English as the official language, the use of English as the medium of instruction in all schools, and the training of English-speaking Indians as teachers. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s, primary-, middle-, and high-schools were opened in many districts of British India, with most high schools offering English language instruction in some subjects. In 1857, just before the end of Company rule, universities modelled on the University of London and using English as the medium of instruction were established in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. During subsequent Crown Rule in India, or the British Raj, lasting from 1858 to 1947, English language penetration increased throughout India. This was driven in part by the gradually increasing hiring of Indians in the civil services. At the time of India's independence in 1947, English was the only functional lingua franca in the country.\n\nAfter Indian Independence in 1947, Hindi was declared the first official language, and attempts were made to declare Hindi the sole national language of India. Due to protests from Tamil Nadu and other non-Hindi-speaking states, it was decided to temporarily retain English for official purposes until at least 1965. By the end of this period, however, opposition from non-Hindi states was still too strong to have Hindi declared the sole language. With this in mind, the English Language Amendment Bill declared English to be an associate language \"until such time as all non-Hindi States had agreed to its being dropped.\" This has not yet occurred, and it is still widely used. For instance, it is the only reliable means of day-to-day communication between the central government and the non-Hindi states.\n\nThe view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.\n\nWhile there is an assumption that English is readily available in India, available studies show that its usage is actually restricted to the elite, because of inadequate education to large parts of the Indian population. The use of outdated teaching methods and the poor grasp of English exhibited by the authors of many guidebooks, disadvantage students who rely on these books.\n\nThe term, \"Hinglish\", is a portmanteau of the languages English and Hindi. This typically refers to the macaronic hybrid use of Hindi, or any South Asian language and English. It is often the growing preferred language of the urban and semi-urban educated Indian youth, as well as the Indian diaspora abroad. The Hindi film industry, more popularly known as Bollywood, incorporates considerable amounts of Hinglish as well. Many internet platforms and voice commands on Google also recognize Hinglish.\n\nMost Indians speak with a native tinted accent for their English speech, whereas the modern generation tends to speak with an accent similar to the Received Pronunciation.\n\nIndian English phonology is ultimately based on Received Pronunciation.\n\nIn general, Indian English has fewer peculiarities in its vowel sounds than the consonants, especially as spoken by native speakers of languages like Hindi, the vowel phoneme system having some similarities with that of English. Among the distinctive features of the vowel-sounds employed by some Indian English speakers:\n\nThe following are the variations in Indian English resulting from inability to articulate few vowels\n\nThe following are the characteristics of dialect of Indian English most similar to RP:\n\nThe following are the variations in Indian English\nThe following are the variations in Indian English that are often discouraged\n\nA number of distinctive features of Indian English are due to \"the vagaries of English spelling\". Most Indian languages, unlike English, have a nearly phonetic spelling, so the spelling of a word is a highly reliable guide to its modern pronunciation. Indians' tendency to pronounce English phonetically as well can cause divergence from Western English.\n\nEnglish is a stress-timed language, and both syllable stress and word stress, where only certain words in a sentence or phrase are stressed, are important features of received pronunciation. Indian native languages are actually syllable-timed languages, like French. Indian-English speakers usually speak with a syllabic rhythm. Further, in some Indian languages, stress is associated with a low pitch, whereas in most English dialects, stressed syllables are generally pronounced with a higher pitch. Thus, when some Indian speakers speak, they appear to put the stress accents at the wrong syllables, or accentuate all the syllables of a long English word. Certain Indian accents are of a \"sing-song\" nature, a feature seen in a few English dialects in Britain, such as Scouse and Welsh English.\n\nThe Indian numbering system is preferred for digit grouping. When written in words, or when spoken,\nnumbers less than 100,000/100 000 are expressed just as they are in Standard English. Numbers including and beyond 100,000 /\n100 000 are expressed in a subset of the Indian numbering system. Thus, the following scale is used:\nLarger numbers are generally expressed as multiples of the above (for example, one lakh crores for one trillion).\n\nIndian English has political, sociological, and administrative terms of modern India: dharna, hartal, eve-teasing, vote bank, swaraj, swadeshi, scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, NRI; it has words of Anglo-India such as tiffin, hill station, gymkhana; and it has slang.\n\nSome examples unique to, or chiefly used in, standard written Indian English include:\n\nIndian English generally uses the same British English spelling as Commonwealth such as Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and South Africa, occasionally with minor differences.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kachari is closely related to surrounding languages, including Tiwa, Rābhā, Hajong, Kochi and Mechi.\n\nWhile there are still living adult speakers, many of children are not learning Kachari as their primary language, instead being assimilated into the wider Assamese and Bengali speaking communities.\n\nKachari consists of the 13 consonants shown below and three Non-syllabics,(Frictional: h, frictionless palatal: y, frictionless rounded velar: w) :\n\nAs can be seen from the chart above, the future tense is indicated with -gan, while -si- indicates that the future event will occur soon or in the near future.

Other common masculine and feminine suffix forms that may be used include -zǎlá/-zǔ, -bundā/-bundi, -bóndá/-bóndi, -phántá/-phánti and -pherá/-pheri.\n\nKachari has a decimal system and counts to 10 with unique words, after which the number words combine to add to the larger number as shown in the chart below.\n"}

Other scholars with work relevant to medium theory include Marshall McLuhan (1963, 1966, 1988) and Neil Postman (1985). Currently, medium theory occupies a marginal position within U.S. communication and media studies (Croteau & Hoynes, 2003:305). The majority of U.S. communication and media studies place their emphasis on the content of communication (e.g., sex and violence) not the medium of communications. In Canada and elsewhere, the theory continues to inform studies that assess large-scale social changes that follow the adoption of a new medium. German media theory operates along similar lines and is influenced by McLuhan, though it occupies a more central location in German academia.\n\nJoshua Meyrowitz (1985) uses the term 'medium theory' to refer to the body of literature that focuses on the technological aspects of media beyond their content. It aims to look beyond the content to the medium which reveals the key to its social impact (Croteau & Hoynes, 2003:305).\n\nMarshall McLuhan is best known for his phrase \"the medium is the message\". McLuhan believed that we should observe not only the media itself but 'the ways in which each new medium disrupts tradition and reshapes social life' (Croteau & Hoynes 2003,307). He believed that the social impact of the media was that they became 'an extension of our senses, and alter our social world' (Croteau & Hoynes, 2003:307). In his book \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\" (1962) McLuhan argued that when new media technologies were introduced into society, the balance of our senses were reworked, highlighting some at the expense of others. For example, print intensified the visual and separated it from our other senses; in particular sound. \"McLuhan even argued that print media helped create a sensory environment that produced Western capitalist societies - an environment that was bureaucratic and organized around mass production, an ideology of individualism, and a commitment to the nation-state as the fundamental social unit.\"\n\nMedium theory has always been criticized by its technological determinism. Raymond Williams is one of the most ardent critics of this concept. He believed that technological determinism 'emerges' from Technical study and experiments and then changes the sector or society in which it emerged from. Which means that we adapt towards the new technologies that arise because it is the new modern way of doing it.\nThe deterministic approach says that technology in itself has the power to change societies and the power to condition humans even though humans are the ones that's using said technology. Although McLuhan strongly believes that the introduction to any new media will change the way we live, Williams argue that the new technology in itself has no real significance to social value unless it has been adapted to existing social and economic conditions.\n\n\n\n"}

(NCI) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that provides real-time and off-line closed captioning, subtitling and translation, described video, web captioning, and Spanish captioning for television and films. Created in 1979 and headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, the organization was the first to caption live TV and home video, and holds the trademark on the display icon featuring a simple geometric rendering of a television set merged with a speech balloon to indicate that a program is captioned by National Captioning Institute. National Captioning Institute also has an office in Santa Clarita, California.\n\nThe National Association of Broadcasters formed a task force in 1972 to create the technology to provide captions of television broadcasts without an unreasonably large financial burden on television networks or local television stations. Federal funding paid for the technology. Viewers would buy an adapter for their televisions that would decode and display the text while watching closed-captioned television programs. Up to that point, captioning of television shows was rare, with Boston television station WGBH being one of the few with open captioning of news and public affairs shows since the early 1970s.\n\nNational Captioning Institute was incorporated on January 30, 1979, with millions of dollars of start-up funding from the federal government. On March 23, 1979, United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare announced plans for closed-captioning of twenty hours per week of television shows. National Captioning Institute established its original headquarters in Bailey's Crossroads, Virginia, and later that year it established a second office in Los Angeles.\n\nNational Captioning Institute's work first became publicly well known on March 16, 1980, when ABC, NBC, and PBS collectively introduced closed-captioning of their television shows. At the time, CBS decided not the join the group at first because CBS preferred a different captioning system that was being used in Europe. John E.D. Ball was the founding president of the National Captioning Institute. Mark Okrand was National Captioning Institute's first supervisor of captioning, overseeing the transcription of audio. At the time, employees of National Captioning Institute used court-reporter steno machines to caption shows.\n\nRosalynn Carter hosted a reception at the White House honoring the work of National Captioning Institute on March 19, 1980. In 1981, Hollywood Radio and Television Society gave an award to the National Captioning Institute for developing the closed captioning system for television shows.\n\nIn 1981, RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video became the first video company to release movies on videotape that had closed captions.\n\nIn 1993, a federal law went into effect that required built-in capacity to display captions on all televisions 13 inches or larger, which would make purchasing separate decoders no longer necessary. Virtually all television shows were being broadcast with closed-captions at that point.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Holli Miller provided live captioning about the September 11 attacks on New York City station WNYW. Miller's shift had been scheduled to end around the time of the attacks, but Miller decided she needed to continue working in order to inform people of the critical information. Miller's hands shook as she typed while the television station showed the second airplane crash into the World Trade Center. Miller worked six hours more than her usual two and a half hour shift, taking only one two-minute break all that time, despite usually taking breaks when commercials are ordinarily broadcast.\n\nIn 2006, National Captioning Institute terminated the employment of 14 employees who had joined the National Association of Employees and Transmission Technicians in an effort to have reasonable workloads, receive annual cost-of-living raises, and prevent cuts in employee benefit plans.\n"}
{"id": "23247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23247", "title": "Phonology", "text": "Phonology\n\nPhonology is a branch of linguistics concerned with the systematic organization of sounds in languages. It has traditionally focused largely on the study of the systems of phonemes in particular languages (and therefore used to be also called \"phonemics\", or \"phonematics\"), but it may also cover any linguistic analysis either at a level beneath the word (including syllable, onset and rime, articulatory gestures, articulatory features, mora, etc.) or at all levels of language where sound is considered to be structured for conveying linguistic meaning. \n\nSign languages have a phonological system equivalent to the system of sounds in spoken languages. The building blocks of signs are specifications for movement, location and handshape.\n\nThe word 'phonology' (as in \"the phonology of English\") can also refer to the phonological system (sound system) of a given language. This is one of the fundamental systems which a language is considered to comprise, like its syntax and its vocabulary.\n\nPhonology is often distinguished from \"phonetics\". While phonetics concerns the physical production, acoustic transmission and perception of the sounds of speech, phonology describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages to encode meaning. For many linguists, phonetics belongs to descriptive linguistics, and phonology to theoretical linguistics, although establishing the phonological system of a language is necessarily an application of theoretical principles to analysis of phonetic evidence. Note that this distinction was not always made, particularly before the development of the modern concept of the phoneme in the mid 20th century. Some subfields of modern phonology have a crossover with phonetics in descriptive disciplines such as psycholinguistics and speech perception, resulting in specific areas like articulatory phonology or laboratory phonology.\n\nThe word \"phonology\" comes from Ancient Greek , \"phōnḗ\", \"voice, sound,\" and the suffix \"-logy\" (which is from Greek , \"lógos\", \"word, speech, subject of discussion\"). Definitions of the term vary. Nikolai Trubetzkoy in \"Grundzüge der Phonologie\" (1939) defines phonology as \"the study of sound pertaining to the system of language,\" as opposed to phonetics, which is \"the study of sound pertaining to the act of speech\" (the distinction between \"language\" and \"speech\" being basically Saussure's distinction between \"langue\" and \"parole\"). More recently, Lass (1998) writes that phonology refers broadly to the subdiscipline of linguistics concerned with the sounds of language, while in more narrow terms, \"phonology proper is concerned with the function, behavior and organization of sounds as linguistic items.\" According to Clark \"et al.\" (2007), it means the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken human language, or the field of linguistics studying this use.\n\nEarly evidence for a systematic study of the sounds in a language appears in the 4th century BCE \"Ashtadhyayi\", a Sanskrit grammar composed by Pāṇini. In particular the \"Shiva Sutras\", an auxiliary text to the \"Ashtadhyayi\", introduces what may be considered a list of the phonemes of the Sanskrit language, with a notational system for them that is used throughout the main text, which deals with matters of morphology, syntax and semantics.\n\nThe study of phonology as it exists today is defined by the formative studies of the 19th-century Polish scholar Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, who (together with his students Mikołaj Kruszewski and Lev Shcherba) shaped the modern usage of the term \"phoneme\" in a series of lectures in 1876-1877. The word \"phoneme\" had been coined a few years earlier in 1873 by the French linguist A. Dufriche-Desgenettes. In a paper read at the 24th of May meeting of the Société de Linguistique de Paris, Dufriche-Desgenettes proposed that \"phoneme\" serve as a one-word equivalent for the German \"Sprachlaut\". Baudouin de Courtenay's subsequent work, though often unacknowledged, is considered to be the starting point of modern phonology. He also worked on the theory of phonetic alternations (what is now called allophony and morphophonology), and may have had an influence on the work of Saussure according to E. F. K. Koerner.\n\nAn influential school of phonology in the interwar period was the Prague school. One of its leading members was Prince Nikolai Trubetzkoy, whose \"Grundzüge der Phonologie\" (\"Principles of Phonology\"), published posthumously in 1939, is among the most important works in the field from this period. Directly influenced by Baudouin de Courtenay, Trubetzkoy is considered the founder of morphophonology, although this concept had also been recognized by de Courtenay. Trubetzkoy also developed the concept of the \"archiphoneme\". Another important figure in the Prague school was Roman Jakobson, who was one of the most prominent linguists of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1968 Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle published \"The Sound Pattern of English\" (SPE), the basis for generative phonology. In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.\n\nNatural phonology is a theory based on the publications of its proponent David Stampe in 1969 and (more explicitly) in 1979. In this view, phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another; which ones are active and which are suppressed is language-specific. Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance. Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously (though the output of one process may be the input to another). The second most prominent natural phonologist is Patricia Donegan (Stampe's wife); there are many natural phonologists in Europe, and a few in the U.S., such as Geoffrey Nathan. The principles of natural phonology were extended to morphology by Wolfgang U. Dressler, who founded natural morphology.\n\nIn 1976, John Goldsmith introduced autosegmental phonology. Phonological phenomena are no longer seen as operating on \"one\" linear sequence of segments, called phonemes or feature combinations, but rather as involving \"some parallel sequences\" of features which reside on multiple tiers. Autosegmental phonology later evolved into feature geometry, which became the standard theory of representation for theories of the organization of phonology as different as lexical phonology and optimality theory.\n\nGovernment phonology, which originated in the early 1980s as an attempt to unify theoretical notions of syntactic and phonological structures, is based on the notion that all languages necessarily follow a small set of principles and vary according to their selection of certain binary parameters. That is, all languages' phonological structures are essentially the same, but there is restricted variation that accounts for differences in surface realizations. Principles are held to be inviolable, though parameters may sometimes come into conflict. Prominent figures in this field include Jonathan Kaye, Jean Lowenstamm, Jean-Roger Vergnaud, Monik Charette, and John Harris.\n\nIn a course at the LSA summer institute in 1991, Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky developed optimality theory—an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints ordered by importance; a lower-ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint. The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology. The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements (e.g. features) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology', especially by Mark Hale and Charles Reiss.\n\nAn integrated approach to phonological theory that combines synchronic and diachronic accounts to sound patterns was initiated with Evolutionary Phonology in recent years.\n\nAn important part of traditional, pre-generative schools of phonology is studying which sounds can be grouped into distinctive units within a language; these units are known as phonemes. For example, in English, the \"p\" sound in \"pot\" is aspirated (pronounced ) while that in \"spot\" is not aspirated (pronounced ). However, English speakers intuitively treat both sounds as variations (allophones) of the same phonological category, that is of the phoneme . (Traditionally, it would be argued that if an aspirated were interchanged with the unaspirated in \"spot\", native speakers of English would still hear the same words; that is, the two sounds are perceived as \"the same\" .) In some other languages, however, these two sounds are perceived as different, and they are consequently assigned to different phonemes. For example, in Thai, Hindi, and Quechua, there are minimal pairs of words for which aspiration is the only contrasting feature (two words can have different meanings but with the only difference in pronunciation being that one has an aspirated sound where the other has an unaspirated one).\n\nPart of the phonological study of a language therefore involves looking at data (phonetic transcriptions of the speech of native speakers) and trying to deduce what the underlying phonemes are and what the sound inventory of the language is. The presence or absence of minimal pairs, as mentioned above, is a frequently used criterion for deciding whether two sounds should be assigned to the same phoneme. However, other considerations often need to be taken into account as well.\n\nThe particular contrasts which are phonemic in a language can change over time. At one time, and , two sounds that have the same place and manner of articulation and differ in voicing only, were allophones of the same phoneme in English, but later came to belong to separate phonemes. This is one of the main factors of historical change of languages as described in historical linguistics.\n\nThe findings and insights of speech perception and articulation research complicate the traditional and somewhat intuitive idea of interchangeable allophones being perceived as the same phoneme. First, interchanged allophones of the same phoneme can result in unrecognizable words. Second, actual speech, even at a word level, is highly co-articulated, so it is problematic to expect to be able to splice words into simple segments without affecting speech perception.\n\nDifferent linguists therefore take different approaches to the problem of assigning sounds to phonemes. For example, they differ in the extent to which they require allophones to be phonetically similar. There are also differing ideas as to whether this grouping of sounds is purely a tool for linguistic analysis, or reflects an actual process in the way the human brain processes a language.\n\nSince the early 1960s, theoretical linguists have moved away from the traditional concept of a phoneme, preferring to consider basic units at a more abstract level, as a component of morphemes; these units can be called \"morphophonemes\", and analysis using this approach is called morphophonology.\n\nIn addition to the minimal units that can serve the purpose of differentiating meaning (the phonemes), phonology studies how sounds alternate, i.e. replace one another in different forms of the same morpheme (allomorphs), as well as, for example, syllable structure, stress, feature geometry, accent, and intonation.\n\nPhonology also includes topics such as phonotactics (the phonological constraints on what sounds can appear in what positions in a given language) and phonological alternation (how the pronunciation of a sound changes through the application of phonological rules, sometimes in a given order which can be feeding or bleeding,) as well as prosody, the study of suprasegmentals and topics such as stress and intonation.\n\nThe principles of phonological analysis can be applied independently of modality because they are designed to serve as general analytical tools, not language-specific ones. The same principles have been applied to the analysis of sign languages (see Phonemes in sign languages), even though the sub-lexical units are not instantiated as speech sounds.\n\n"}

This phenomenon is also observed in the Hanunuo traditions of Urukay, perhaps closely related to the Erekay of the Cuyonons, both being a form of \"Balagtasan\". Ratagnon also have terms specific to their lowland river surroundings which are not present in modern Cuyonon, most of which are borrowings from Hanunuo and Buhid, whereas a few are either archaic Cuyonon terms or innovations made within the Ratagnon language. Aside from the aforementioned differences from the Cuyonon language, the two languages are still very much mutually intelligible.\nDifferences from Cuyonon would include:\n\nThe usage of the \"t\" sound over the \"d\" sound, present in:\nUsage of the \"k\" sound over the \"g\" sound:\n\nThe aforementioned dropping off the schwa for the \"u\" sound present in:\n\nThe preference to the \"l\" over the \"r\" sound\n\nThere are some words that have differed in meaning from Cuyonon to Ratagnon, this is most observed at the terms specific to their respective surroundings, these have created false friends that have almost the same meaning but still differ.\n\nAccording to the \"Ethnologue\", Ratagnon is spoken in the southernmost extreme tip of Mindoro islands, including the municipalities of Magsaysay and Bulalacao.\n\nBarbian (1977) lists the following locations.\n\nRatagnon may be closely related to the Cuyonon language, a Visayan language spoken in the Cuyo Archipelago just to the south of Mindoro. This may be brought about by migrations of Cuyonons to the southern tip of Mindoro, akin to their migrations to mainland Palawan, a very much gradual process. It could be inferred that these migrations happened at an earlier date before the migrations to mainland Palawan started (around the mid to late 19th century) due to its diversion from the Cuyonon language (Given that Ratagnon descended from an older language spoken in the general area West of Panay, Ratagnon and Cuyonon are classified under Kuyan), whereas the Cuyonon of mainland Palawan, Calamian and that of the Cuyo itself remain the same language with relatively little dialectal differences.\n\n"}

The classical example of a source separation problem is the cocktail party problem, where a number of people are talking simultaneously in a room (for example, at a cocktail party), and a listener is trying to follow one of the discussions. The human brain can handle this sort of auditory source separation problem, but it is a difficult problem in digital signal processing. This was first analyzed by Colin Cherry.\n\nSeveral approaches have been proposed for the solution of this problem but development is currently still very much in progress. Some of the more successful approaches are principal components analysis and independent component analysis, which work well when there are no delays or echoes present; that is, the problem is simplified a great deal. The field of computational auditory scene analysis attempts to achieve auditory source separation using an approach that is based on human hearing.\n\nThe human brain must also solve this problem in real time. In human perception this ability is commonly referred to as auditory scene analysis or the cocktail party effect.\n\nOne of the practical applications being researched in this area is medical imaging of the brain with magnetoencephalography (MEG). This kind of imaging involves careful measurements of magnetic fields outside the head which yield an accurate 3D-picture of the interior of the head. However, external sources of electromagnetic fields, such as a wristwatch on the subject's arm, will significantly degrade the accuracy of the measurement. Applying source separation techniques on the measured signals can help remove undesired artifacts from the signal.\n\nAnother application is the separation of musical signals. For a stereo mix of relatively simple signals it is now possible to make a fairly accurate separation, although some artifacts remain.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "588290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588290", "title": "The Emergency (Ireland)", "text": "The Emergency (Ireland)\n\nThe Emergency () was the state of emergency which existed in the state of Ireland during the Second World War. The state of Ireland remained neutral throughout the war. \"The Emergency\" has been used metonymically in historical and cultural commentary to refer to the state during the war. The state of emergency was proclaimed by Dáil Éireann on 2 September 1939, allowing the passage of the Emergency Powers Act 1939 by the Oireachtas the following day. This gave sweeping new powers to the government for the duration of the Emergency, including internment, censorship of the press and correspondence, and government control of the economy. The Emergency Powers Act lapsed on 2 September 1946. Although the state of emergency itself was not rescinded until 1 September 1976, no emergency legislation was ever in force after 1946 to exploit this anomaly.\n\nOn 6 December 1922, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty that ended the War of Independence, the island of Ireland became an autonomous dominion, known as the Irish Free State. On 8 December 1922, the parliament of the six north-eastern counties, already known as Northern Ireland, voted to opt out of the Irish Free State and rejoin the United Kingdom. This Treaty settlement was immediately followed by the bitter Irish Civil War between the pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty factions of the Irish Republican Army.\n\nAfter 1932, the governing party of the new state was the republican \"Fianna Fáil\", led by Éamon de Valera (a veteran of both Irish wars and Easter Rising). In 1937, de Valera introduced a new constitution, which had distanced the state further from the United Kingdom, and which changed its name to \"Ireland\". In 1932–38 he had also conducted the Anglo-Irish Trade War.\n\nDe Valera had good relations with the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain. He resolved the two countries' economic differences, and negotiated the return of the Treaty Ports—Berehaven, Cobh and Lough Swilly—which had remained under British jurisdiction under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. The major remaining disagreement between the countries was the status of Northern Ireland. The Irish saw it as rightfully Irish territory while the UK saw it as rightfully British territory. Within Ireland itself, armed opposition to the treaty settlement took the name of the anti-treaty IRA, seeing itself as the \"true\" government of Ireland. This IRA mounted armed attacks both in Great Britain (most notably the S-Plan in 1939) and Ireland.\n\nOn September 1, 1939, German troops invaded Poland, precipitating war with the UK and France, and their allies. On 2 September, de Valera told the Dáil Éireann (the lower house of parliament) that neutrality was the best policy for the country. In this he was almost universally supported by the Dáil and the country at large (although many joined the British military). The 1937 constitution was amended to allow the Government to take emergency powers, and then the Emergency Powers Act 1939 was passed that included censorship of the press and mail correspondence. The government was able to take control of the economic life of the country under the new Minister of Supply Seán Lemass. Liberal use was made of all of these powers. Internment of those who had committed a crime or were about to commit one would be used extensively against the IRA. Censorship was under the charge of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, Frank Aiken. It was necessary to prevent publication of matter that might undermine the neutrality of the State and to prevent it becoming a clearing house for foreign intelligence, though over the period of the Emergency, the Act started to be used for more party political purposes such as preventing the publication of the numbers of Irish soldiers serving in the United Kingdom armed forces or industrial disputes within the state. In addition, the information made available to Irish people was also carefully controlled. De Valera performed the duties of Minister of External Affairs, though the secretary for the Department of External Affairs, Joseph Walshe, was very influential.\n\nOn the declaration of the emergency, Walshe asked for assurances from the German minister in Dublin, Eduard Hempel that Germany would not use its legation for espionage nor attack Irish trade with Great Britain. He then travelled to London on 6 September where he met the Dominions Secretary, Anthony Eden, who was conciliatory and defended Irish neutrality in subsequent Cabinet meetings. In addition, the appointment of Sir John Maffey as a British representative in Dublin was agreed.\n\nFor the Irish government, neutrality meant not displaying alignment with either side. On one hand, that meant the open announcement of military activity such as the sighting of submarines or the arrival of parachutists, and the suppression of any foreign intelligence activity. Ireland's geographic position meant that this policy (which was, in the view of most historians, applied fully and consistently) tended to benefit the Allies more than Germany. For example, British airmen who crash-landed in the State were allowed to go free if they could claim not to have been on a combat mission, otherwise they were released \"on licence\" (promise to remain). Many chose to escape to Great Britain via Northern Ireland. Also, Allied mechanics were allowed to retrieve crash-landed Allied aircraft. There was extensive co-operation between British and Irish intelligence and the exchange of information such as detailed weather reports of the Atlantic Ocean; the decision to go ahead with the D-day landings was influenced by a weather report from Blacksod Bay, County Mayo.\n\nOn the other hand, in the first few years of the war, the government did not show any overt preference for either side. This is partly because de Valera had to keep national unity, which meant accommodating the large swathe of Irish society that rejected anything to do with the British, some of whom admired Germany (which had failed in an attempt to supply a small cache of arms to the rebels of 1916) to some extent. These attitudes were shared by Aiken and by Walshe. The Fianna Fáil government, headed by Éamon de Valera, ruled alone and did not accommodate any other party in decision-making.\n\nIn the early months of the emergency, the greatest threat to the State came from the IRA. In the Christmas Raid in 1939, one million rounds of ammunition were stolen from the Irish Army by the IRA (though it was mostly recovered in the following weeks) and there were a number of killings, mostly of policemen. In addition, the existing emergency legislation was undermined by the obtaining of a writ of \"habeas corpus\" by Seán MacBride which resulted in the release of all those who had been interned. The government responded with the 1939 and 1940 Offences Against the State Acts, which established the Special Criminal Court, and rearrested and interned IRA activists. A hunger strike was started in Mountjoy Prison in an attempt to gain political status, which collapsed after the death of two prisoners. In retaliation Dublin Castle was bombed and there were a number of serious incidents throughout the country.\n\nThe IRA fostered links with German intelligence (the Abwehr) and Foreign Ministry, with men such as Francis Stuart travelling to Germany to talk, though these attempts were largely ineffectual due to a combination of Abwehr and Foreign Ministry incompetence and IRA weakness. Germans also came to Ireland, the most notable of whom was Hermann Görtz, who was captured in possession of \"Plan Kathleen\"- an IRA plan that detailed a German-supported invasion of Northern Ireland. (See also: Irish Republican Army – Abwehr collaboration in World War II).\n\nTwo IRA men were executed for the murder of two policemen in September 1940, and the IRA became increasingly ineffective in the face of the resolute use of internment, the breaking of hunger strikes, and the application of hanging for capital offences. During 1941, the hope of a German invasion had faded and funding from the United States had been cut off. The IRA leadership were mostly interned within the Curragh Camp, where they were treated increasingly harshly, or on the run. Most internees accepted release on parole. The IRA remained barely active in Northern Ireland, but they were not a threat to the stability of Ireland.\n\nThere was a reluctance on the part of the British to accept the policy of Irish neutrality. Anthony Eden, Dominions\nSecretary in the new British war cabinet, said \"we do not want formally to recognise Eire as\nneutral while Eire remains a member of the British Commonwealth\" as this he said would be in conflict with the \"constitutional theory of the indivisibility of the crown.\" A prevalent view in the UK was that Ireland was obliged to support the UK in the war. Churchill said at the time that \"Southern Ireland is at war, but skulking\".\n\nAfter the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, Winston Churchill became the British Prime Minister. The fall of France in June 1940 brought the war close to Ireland, as German troops occupied the French coastline across the Celtic Sea.\n\nThe United Kingdom was now the only major impediment to Germany. A major British concern was now whether Germany would invade Ireland. The British view was that the Irish Army was not powerful enough to resist an invasion for long enough for reinforcement from the UK, particularly with the IRA as a potential fifth column, and wished to be able to forestall this by stationing troops and ships within the Irish state. In addition, this view made the UK reluctant to provide military supplies because of the risk of their falling into German hands after an invasion. The Irish government's view was that they would be more successful against the Germans than the states already occupied, and there could be no agreement for joint military measures while partition continued, and would not commit themselves beyond neutrality for the whole island should it end.\n\nBy June 1940, the British representative in Ireland, Maffey, was urging that \"the strategic unity of our island group\" should take precedence over Ulster Unionism, and Churchill was making clear that there should be no military action taken against Ireland. The British Minister for Health, Malcolm MacDonald, who had negotiated the 1938 trade agreement with Ireland whilst Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, was sent to Dublin to explore possibilities with De Valera. From these Chamberlain produced a six-point proposal that committed the UK government to a united Ireland and proposed the setting-up of a joint body to effect this. A Joint Defence Council would be set up immediately and the State provided with military equipment. In return the State would join the Allies and intern all German and Italian aliens. Rejected by the Irish government, the proposal was then amended to strengthen the steps towards a united Ireland, and no longer requiring Ireland to join the war, but only to invite British forces to use Irish bases and ports. De Valera rejected the revised proposal on 4 July and made no counter proposal. One reason for this would have been the difficult calculation of how damaging the inevitable split in Ireland would be if such a proposal was accepted. One of the main reasons was that the Irish Government thought that the UK would lose the war and did not want to be on the losing side: during the negotiations Walshe had produced two memoranda for De Valera (one entitled \"Britain's Inevitable Defeat\") predicting the isolation of Great Britain, the dismemberment of its empire, and finally its inevitable crushing by Germany. Walshe also wrote approvingly of the character of the Pétain government. Walshe's memoranda affected de Valera, with him telling MacDonald that Great Britain \"could not destroy this [German] colossal machine\".\nNevertheless, from May 1940, Walshe and Col Liam Archer of Irish Military Intelligence discussed the defence of Ireland in the event of a German invasion with counterparts in Northern Ireland and a general strategic plan for UK military action \"Plan W\" across the border \"if invited\" was developed.\n\nThe great majority of Ireland's trade was with the United Kingdom, and most of its supplies came from there. This created great difficulties for the Irish government as Germany tried to blockade the UK. Additionally the UK required Irish ships to operate under their 'navicert' system. In September 1940, a joint agreement on trade, shipping and exports fell through, \"the main sticking point between the two sides was the prices on offer from Britain\" owing to the refusal to allow transshipment and repair facilities following German pressure, including the threat to blockade Ireland and the bombing of Ambrosetown and Campile in County Wexford. In the autumn of 1940, the threat of German invasion had receded, but relations between the UK and Ireland deteriorated, largely as a result of the increased losses of Allied shipping to U-boat attack. To try to prevent some of these losses, the UK wanted sea and air bases in western Ireland. On 5 November, in the House of Commons, Churchill complained:\nThe fact that we cannot use the South and West coasts of Ireland to refuel our flotillas and aircraft and thus protect the trade by which Ireland as well as Great Britain lives, is a most heavy and grievous burden and one which should never have been placed on our shoulders, broad though they may be.\n\nThe Irish Government chose to interpret this sentence as a threat of invasion. Some sort of armed occupation was a real possibility, but the balance of evidence is that there was never a serious threat. Large elements of the British cabinet and government and those of its allies were opposed to any armed intervention in Ireland; however, in late 1940 and early 1941, relations between the two countries did worsen. The British stopped informing Ireland of its order of battle in Northern Ireland, while the Irish Army drew up plans for defence against the British. The United Kingdom also started to restrict trade to Ireland, reasoning that if Ireland would not do anything to protect the lives of those bringing in supplies, it should at least share in the deprivations being felt in the UK. Relations between the UK and Ireland only really eased in the middle of 1941 with the invasion of the Soviet Union by Germany and an agreement to allow Irish immigration to Britain to work in the war industries, resulting in up to 200,000 Irish people doing so by 1945.\n\nOnly since 2000 has the wartime Irish economy been studied, away from the grander issues of diplomacy and warfare. Being still largely dependent on Britain for coal, manufactured goods and fuel oils, supplies of these were reduced after the fall of France in mid-1940, causing price inflation and a busy black market. It was said that \"the poor are like hunted rats looking for bread\", as wheat supplies fell, and that the introduction of full rationing was \"seriously belated\". Typhus reappeared and the government started planning for famine relief in late 1941. John Betjeman, the British press attaché in Dublin, reported \"No coal. No petrol. No gas. No electric. No paraffin. Guinness good.\" In March 1942 the government banned the export of beers, and decided that more wheat should be grown, and less barley. The prospect of a shortage of beer led on to barter deals whereby Britain supplied wheat suitable for making bread flour, and coal, and in return Ireland allowed the export of beers. \"These supplies were to keep neutral Ireland afloat during World War II and enable the continuance of Irish neutrality\".\n\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, the United States President was Franklin Roosevelt. The United States was neutral, and Roosevelt's actions were circumscribed by neutrality legislation; however, Roosevelt was a vehement anti-Nazi, an unequivocal supporter of the UK in the war, and personally close to Churchill. The US minister to Ireland was David Gray, a personal friend of Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor. De Valera saw the US as a bulwark against invasion from any party, while the US saw the support of Britain in the war as the priority, and so while supportive of Irish neutrality was sceptical of it extending over the whole island and wanted an arrangement to be made with the UK over ports, possibly through the leasing of them.\n\nThe sale of arms was a major issue. The declaration of war legally impeded the US from selling any arms to belligerents under the laws in force at the time; this led to Ireland being briefly considered as a possible conduit for arms sales to circumvent the law. However, in November 1939 Congress agreed to change the law to allow the sale of arms to all belligerents on a \"cash and carry\" basis. Nevertheless, the Irish government wanted the US to sell them arms. This was supported by Gray, and by the British government, but only if not at the expense of their own allocation. As a result, in 1940 all surplus US arms were sold to the UK and Canada.\n\nThe strong support of the UK by the Roosevelt administration led the Irish government to try to bolster anti-Roosevelt isolationist opinion in the November 1940 presidential election and a Christmas radio broadcast by de Valera to the US supporting isolationism. An attempt to influence Roosevelt's special emissary, Wendell Willkie, on a visit to Great Britain and Ireland January 1941, failed. In a further attempt to obtain arms from the US de Valera decided that Aiken should visit Washington. Gray supported the idea of a visit, but had doubts over whether Aiken was the right person to make it, and stressed that the Irish were only likely to obtain arms if they co-operated with the British Purchasing Commission. Aiken left Ireland in March 1941. For his St Patrick's day address, de Valera claimed that Ireland was under blockade from both sides and that neutrality protected Ireland from \"the hazards of imperial adventure\". Aiken's visit was disastrous. His anti-British views and, in American eyes, overestimation of Ireland's military capabilities went across all the administration's policies towards the war. As well as alienating Roosevelt and other members of the administration, he failed to use the letters of introduction to senior Democrats, including Eleanor Roosevelt, provided to him by Gray. Aiken spent the last seven weeks of his visit on what was seen as an anti-administration speaking tour, associating closely with isolationist opinion. The result was that the US would not sell any armaments to the State, and relations between the two countries significantly worsened, the US becoming even more unequivocal in its support of the UK. In October 1941 on receiving a note from the Irish government asking for its intentions with regard to Northern Ireland on the stationing of personnel associated with lend-lease, the US State Department referred them to the British government as Northern Ireland was, they insisted, part of the UK.\n\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland (as part of the United Kingdom) was at war and the Harland and Wolff shipyards in Belfast were among the strategic targets for German attack. The Luftwaffe carried out a bombing raid on Belfast on 7 April 1941; eight people died. On 15 April 1941, 180 Luftwaffe bombers attacked Belfast. There was only one RAF squadron and seven anti-aircraft batteries to defend Belfast. Over 200 tons of explosives, 80 landmines attached to parachutes and 800 firebomb canisters were dropped. Over 1,000 died and 56,000 houses (more than half of the city's housing stock) were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. At 4.30 Basil Brooke asked de Valera for assistance. Within two hours, 13 fire tenders from Dublin, Drogheda, Dundalk and Dún Laoghaire were on their way to cross the Irish border to assist their Belfast colleagues. De Valera followed up with his \"they are our people\" speech. Although there was a later raid on 4 May, it was confined to the docks and shipyards.\n\nIn early January 1941, there had been several minor German bombings of Irish territory. There were three deaths in Borris, County Carlow and other incidents in Wexford, Dublin and at the Curragh. The public mood was already agitated, fearing a German invasion and the implications of the bombings added to the concern. So as not to antagonise the Germans further, the Irish authorities initially declined to confirm that the bombs were German. Public speculation, and IRA claims, that the bombs were British, or German but released by British aircraft, later prompted Irish Government denials.\n\nOn the night of 30/31 May 1941, Dublin's Northside was the target of a Luftwaffe air raid. Thirty-eight were killed and seventy houses were destroyed on Summerhill Parade, North Strand and the North Circular Road. Unlike the earlier bombing incidents, there was no public speculation that the perpetrators were anyone other than the Luftwaffe. The Irish government promptly protested and Germany apologised claiming that high winds were to blame or there had been British interference with navigation signals. Winston Churchill later conceded that the raids might have been the result of a British invention which distorted Luftwaffe radio guidance beams so as to throw their planes off course. Dublin had limited blackout regulations at the time, so the city was clearly visible, unlike British cities.\n\nOn 3 October, the German news agency announced that the German government would pay compensation, but only West Germany paid this after the war, using Marshall Aid money.\n\n\n\nIn pursuit of its policy of neutrality, the Irish Government refused to close the German and Japanese embassies. In 1939, the German Government had very little intelligence on Ireland and Britain. This is because Hitler had hoped for a détente or alliance with Britain, whom he considered the \"natural allies\" of Nazi Germany. When concerted efforts to build a reliable picture of British military strength did begin around 1939–1940, efforts were first made to infiltrate spies to Britain via Ireland, but these attempts consistently failed (see Operation Lobster and Operation Seagull). The Abwehr also made attempts to foster intelligence gathering links with the IRA, but found that the IRA was in no condition to be of serious use — these attempts were to occur during the period 1939–1943. The German military also drew up plans detailing how an invasion of Ireland might take place. These plans were titled Plan Green and any invasion was to act as a diversionary attack in support of a main attack to conquer Britain titled Operation Sea Lion. Both of these plans were shelved by 1942. When US Army troops began to be stationed in Northern Ireland in 1942, Plan Green was reprinted because there was a fear amongst the German High Command (and the Irish Government) that the US Army might attempt an invasion of Ireland, following its occupation of Iceland (after the British invasion) and Greenland in 1941. These fears led to another German intelligence plan – Operation Osprey – but it was abandoned when the feared American invasion failed to take place.\n\nThe British also had a plan to occupy the entire Island as a response to any attempted German invasion. They had always sought to privately reassure de Valera that any invasion by their troops would be by invitation only. This scheme was titled Plan W and intricate details were worked out with the Irish government and military over how to react to a German invasion. The Irish military shared details of their defences and military capabilities with the British and troops stationed in Northern Ireland. The reassurances from the British did not altogether console de Valera however, and he was frequently suspicious, while German forces still threatened Britain, that the British might invade the territory of the State. He did not know that the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Craigavon, was urging London to seize the port at Cobh, or that attempts had been made to split the consensus over the Neutrality policy. Concessions such as relaxing of the claim on Lough Swilly to allow British navy and airforce patrols did go some way to easing the tension. As the war turned against Nazi Germany in their eastern campaign, and as the Abwehr became less and less effective, around 1943–1944, operations in the island of Ireland ceased to be of interest to the German Government and military and therefore the British. Overall, during the period the focus of de Valera was maintaining Irish neutrality. The Irish authorities' pursuit of an aggressive campaign of internment against the IRA, including raising the Local Security Force (LSF), executions, and aggressive action by Irish Military Intelligence (G2) meant that the activities of the German Legation in Dublin were supervised closely and attempts to infiltrate spies into the country were quickly discovered.\n\nOn the occasion of the death of Adolf Hitler, de Valera paid a controversial visit to Hempel to express sympathy with the German people over the death of the Führer. This action has been defended as proper given the state's neutrality. Sir John Maffey, the British Representative, commented that de Valera's actions were \"unwise but mathematically consistent\". Douglas Hyde, Ireland's president, also sent condolences, an action which enraged the United States minister as no similar action had taken place on the death of the United States President, Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nElements of Irish public opinion were markedly different in their treatment of the Axis powers. A \"Limerick Leader\" editorial in 1945 noted that, \"The campaign against war criminals is strangely confined to those who happen to fight on the wrong side.\" However it continued to say that Allied atrocities cannot excuse the monstrous barbarism of the Reich.\n\nAccording to some sources, it appears that there was official indifference from the political establishment to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust during and after the war. This was despite De Valera having knowledge of the crimes committed against Jewish victims of the Holocaust as early as 1943. Other sources report that De Valera was so aware in 1942 and the government sought to secure the release of Jews from then. After the war had ended, Jewish groups had difficulty in getting refugee status for Jewish children – whilst at the same time, a plan to bring over four hundred Catholic children from the Rhineland encountered no difficulties. The Department of Justice explained in 1948 that:\nIt has always been the policy of the Minister for Justice to restrict the admission of Jewish aliens, for the reason that any substantial increase in our Jewish population might give rise to an anti-Semitic problem.\n\nHowever, De Valera over-ruled the Department of Justice and the 150 refugee Jewish children were brought to Ireland in 1948. Earlier, in 1946, 100 Jewish children from Poland were brought to Clonyn Castle in County Meath by a London Jewish charity.\n\nEsther Steinberg and her Paris-born, Belgian-fathered son Leon were the only Irish victims of the Holocaust, dying in Auschwitz having been transported there from Paris in 1942.\n\nDe Valera's reluctance to recognise a difference between World War II and previous European wars was illustrated by his reply to a radio broadcast by the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill on V-E Day. Churchill praised Britain's restraint in not occupying Ireland to secure the Western Approaches during the Battle of the Atlantic:\nthe approaches which the southern Irish ports and airfields could so easily have guarded were closed by the hostile aircraft and U-boats. This indeed was a deadly moment in our life, and if it had not been for the loyalty and friendship of Northern Ireland, we should have been forced to come to close quarters with Mr. de Valera, or perish from the earth. However, with a restraint and poise to which, I venture to say, history will find few parallels, His Majesty’s Government never laid a violent hand upon them, though at times it would have been quite easy and quite natural, and we left the de Valera Government to frolic with the German and later with the Japanese representatives to their heart’s content.\n\nDe Valera replied to Churchill in another radio broadcast, which was popular when broadcast in Ireland:\nAllowances can be made for Mr. Churchill’s statement, however unworthy, in the first flush of victory. No such excuse could be found for me in this quieter atmosphere. There are, however, some things it is essential to say. I shall try to say them as dispassionately as I can. Mr. Churchill makes it clear that, in certain circumstances, he would have violated our neutrality and that he would justify his actions by Britain’s necessity. It seems strange to me that Mr. Churchill does not see that this, if accepted, would mean that Britain's necessity would become a moral code and that when this necessity became sufficiently great, other people’s rights were not to count... that is precisely why we had this disastrous succession of wars — World War No.1 and World War No.2 — and shall it be World War No.3? Surely Mr. Churchill must see that if his contention be admitted in our regard, a like justification can be framed for similar acts of aggression elsewhere and no small nation adjoining a great Power could ever hope to be permitted to go its own way in peace. It is indeed fortunate that Britain's necessity did not reach the point where Mr. Churchill would have acted. All credit to him that he successfully resisted the temptation which I have no doubt many times assailed him in his difficulties, and to which, I freely admit, many leaders might have easily succumbed. It is indeed hard for the strong to be just to the weak, but acting justly always has its rewards. By resisting his temptation in this instance, Mr. Churchill, instead of adding another horrid chapter to the already bloodstained record of the relations between England and this country, has advanced the cause of international morality — an important step, one of the most important indeed that can be taken on the road to the establishment of any sure basis for peace...\n\nMr. Churchill is proud of Britain’s stand alone, after France had fallen and before America entered the war. Could he not find in his heart the generosity to acknowledge that there is a small nation that stood alone not for one year or two, but for several hundred years against aggression; that endured spoliations, famine, massacres, in endless succession; that was clubbed many times into insensibility, but each time on returning to consciousness took up the fight anew; a small nation that could never be got to accept defeat and has never surrendered her soul?\n\nUnlike other neutral states, Ireland did not introduce a general prohibition on its citizens opting for foreign enlistment during the war. However, one serious concern of government in this regard was the relatively high number of Irish soldiers deserting and leaving the jurisdiction. Estimates of between 4,000 and 7,000 members of the Irish armed forces deserted to join the armed forces of belligerent nations, the majority serving in the British Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.\n\nOn 17 May 1945, Minister for Defence Oscar Traynor stated that he proposed introducing legislation which would deprive deserters of any right \"for a long time to come\" to employment paid for from public funds. The legislation in question was the Emergency Powers (No. 362) order which was passed on 8 August 1945. This punished those who had deserted during the Emergency in four ways:\n\n\nThe Order only applied to personnel who had been called to active duty during the Emergency or who had enlisted \"for the duration\" of the Emergency and affected 4,000 men.\n\nThe government's reasons for passing the order have been given as follows:\n\n\nOn 18 October 1945 Thomas F. O'Higgins moved to annul the order. He did not condone desertion, but felt that the order was specifically awarding harsh punishment to those deserters who had served in the Allied forces. General Richard Mulcahy also spoke against the Order, disagreeing with the way in which it applied to enlisted men and not to officers. However, despite the arguments put forward by O'Higgins and Mulcahy, the Dáil voted in favour of the order.\n\nAn amnesty was enacted in the Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Act 2013, which admitted that the penalties were 'now considered to have been unduly harsh' and offered an apology to those affected. The Minister of Defence, Alan Shatter, commented that it 'was a tribute to how far we had come as a society that such a sensitive issue could get practically unanimous support from all sides in the Dáil'.\n\nIn April 1995 Taoiseach John Bruton paid tribute to those who \"volunteered to fight against Nazi tyranny in Europe, at least 10,000 of whom were killed while serving in British uniforms. In recalling their bravery, we are recalling a shared experience of Irish and British people. We remember a British part of the inheritance of all who live in Ireland.\"\n\n\nEvans, Bryce. ‘Ireland during the Second World War:Farewell to Plato's Cave (Manchester University Press, 2014).\n\n"}

Mellon Foundation's 'Scholarly Communications' programme, and the project consortium has been expanded to include the British Library.\n\n\"Transcribe Bentham\" was launched in September 2010. The project makes available, via a transcription interface based on a customised MediaWiki, high-quality digital images of UCL's vast collection of unpublished manuscripts written and composed by the philosopher and reformer, Jeremy Bentham, which runs to some 60,000 manuscript folios (an estimated 30,000,000 words). Under the Mellon Foundation grant, almost all of the UCL Bentham Papers will be digitised, along with all of the British Library's own collection of Bentham manuscripts, some 12,500 manuscript folios (or an estimated 6,000,000 words).\n\nThe project recruits volunteers to assist in transcribing the material, and thereby contribute to the Bentham Project's production of the new edition of \"The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham\". Volunteer-produced transcripts are also uploaded to UCL's digital Bentham Papers repository, in order to widen access to the collection, and ensure its long-term preservation.\n\nVolunteers can sign-up for a user account at the Transcription Desk. Once registered, they are given transcriber privileges. The volunteer then selects a manuscript, and is presented with a manuscript image alongside a free-text box, into which he or she enters their transcript (which can be saved at any time). Volunteers are also asked to add some basic formatting to their transcripts, and encode their work in Text-Encoding Initiative-compliant XML using a specially designed transcription toolbar. Using this, the volunteer can highlight a piece of text, or a position in the text, and click a button on the toolbar to identify a particular characteristic of that chosen portion. These include line breaks, paragraphs, unusual spellings, and frequent additions, deletions and marginalia present in the manuscripts.\n\nWhen a volunteer is happy with his or her transcript, it is submitted to \"Transcribe Bentham\" project staff for checking. Changes are made to the text and code, if necessary, and staff decide whether or not the transcript has been completed to a satisfactory degree for uploading to the digital repository. If it is decided that no further appreciable improvements can be made, the transcript is locked for further editing and converted to an XML file. However, if staff decide that a submitted transcript is incomplete - i.e. if it is partially transcribed, or there are a number of missing or unclear words - then it will remain unlocked for further crowdsourcing.\n\nWork is currently ongoing to make improvements and modifications to the transcription interface.\n\nAs of 18 March 2016, volunteers had transcribed or partially transcribed 15,634 manuscripts - around 7 million words - of which 94% were of the required standard to form a basis for editorial work, and to be uploaded to the digital repository. Weekly progress updates are issued via the \"Transcribe Bentham\" blog.\n\nThe work of \"Transcribe Bentham\" has been reported upon by the international media. This coverage includes a feature article in \"The New York Times\", \"The Sunday Times\", \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", Deutsche Welle World radio, and Austria's ORF1 radio.\n\nIn September 2011, \"Transcribe Bentham\" was honoured with an Award of Distinction in the Digital Communities category of the Prix Ars Electronica, the world's foremost digital arts competition. In its report, the Digital Communities jury noted that the \"Transcribe Bentham\" transcription interface has 'the potential to become a standard tool for scholarly crowdsourcing projects', and that \"Transcribe Bentham\" as a whole has the 'potential to create the legacy of participatory education and the preservation of heritage or an endangered culture'.\n\n\"Transcribe Bentham\" was also nominated for the 2011 Digital Heritage Award, along with:\n\n\nIn November 2012, \"Transcribe Bentham\" came second in the Knetworks 'Platforms for Networked Innovation Competition', which sought to identify the 'most innovative web-based platform enabling regional innovation for public, private or research organizations'.\n\n\"Transcribe Bentham\" was featured on BBC Radio 4's \"PM \"programme and the BBC News website on 27 August 2013. The report discussed how volunteers transcribed a series of recipes which were collated for Bentham's proposed panopticon prison, and how one - a 'Devonshire Pie' consisting of potatoes, tripe, onions, spleen, lungs, and gooseberries - was made by the Michelin-starred St John Smithfield restaurant.\n\nThe code for \"Transcribe Bentham's\" MediaWiki-based transcription interface is available for reuse and customisation, on an open source basis. It has been implemented by the Public Record Office Victoria for their pilot transcription project.\n\n"}

At its peak the population of foreign soldiers was equal to that of Icelandic men. Many of the foreign soldiers would court Icelandic women and estimates of the number of local women who married foreign soldiers goes into the hundreds. Such interaction between Icelandic women and foreign troops was not always well received and the women involved were often accused of prostitution and betraying their home country. Children born from such unions are known in Icelandic as \"ástandsbörn\" (\"children of the condition/situation\").\n\nWhen the British Army invaded Iceland in 1940 people gathered on the streets to see the troops and the fact that many young Icelandic girls were captivated by them did not go unnoticed. Immediately discussions began over what effect this would have and minimal interaction with the troops was encouraged, but this proved to be difficult as many Icelanders had jobs in some way connected to the troops. A committee was formed which produced a damning report on the soldiers, which shed light on widespread prostitution amongst the troops. Some sources suggested that girls as young as twelve years old were involved in prostitution. The Icelandic authorities tried unsuccessfully to reduce the soldiers' encounters with Icelandic girls but with time the issue lapsed and was no longer part of the current affairs. The soldiers went home with the conclusion of the war in 1945.\n\nUS troops returned to Iceland in 1951 as part of the Iceland Defense Force during the Cold War. In order to reassure Icelandic authorities, the troops were quarantined in the Keflavík Air Base, which remained in operation until 2006.\n\n"}
