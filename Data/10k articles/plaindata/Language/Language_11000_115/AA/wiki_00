He is perhaps best known for writing the lyrics to \"Amar Bhaier Rôkte Rangano\" which is the most widely celebrated song commemorating the Bengali Language Movement.\n\nChoudhury was born Ulania, Mehendiganj, Barisal Division, Bengal Presidency (now Bangladesh), British India. He graduated from Dhaka University in 1959 and came to England on 5 October 1974.\n\nChoudhury's father, Hazi Wahed Reza Choudhury, was a landlord and freedom fighter of British India. He was the president of Barisal District Congress and a member of the All India Congress Working Committee. His father was imprisoned in 1942 August Movement. He served as secretary to Motilal Nehru. Zohra Khatun was Choudhury's mother.\n\nThey are three brothers and five sisters, Ali Reza Choudhury (Mehdi) his younger brother, Hossain reja Choudhury his elder brother. His sisters name is; Manik bibi choudhury, Laili Khatun choudhury, Saleha Khatun choudhury, Masuma Begum choudhury and his younger sister name Fazilatun Nesa Choudhury.\n\nBefore moving to the United Kingdom, Choudhury worked as a journalist in different national newspapers in Dhaka. During the 1971 Bangladeshi Liberation War, he worked for \"Joy Bangla\", \"Jugantar\" and \"Anandabazar Patrika\".\n\nHe is perhaps best known for writing the lyrics to \"Amar Bhaier Rokte Rangano\" which is recognised as the most influential song of Bengali Language Movement and was initially set to music by him. Later, however, Altaf Mahmud's composed music and adapted the song. It has been regarded by listeners of BBC Bengali Service as the third best song in Bengali.\n\nIn the UK, Choudhury founded the newspaper \"Notun Din\". He has written 35 five books.

Their son, Anupam, works for \"Reuters\", and their four daughters are Tanima, Chinmoyee, Binita and Indira.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2335", "title": "Adamic language", "text": "Adamic language\n\nThe Adamic language is, according to Jewish tradition (as recorded in the \"midrashim\") and some Christians, the language spoken by Adam (and possibly Eve) in the Garden of Eden. It is variously interpreted as either the language used by God to address Adam (the divine language), or the language invented by Adam with which he named all things (including Eve), as in the Genesis creation narrative ().\n\nTraditional Jewish exegesis such as Midrash (Genesis Rabbah 38) says that Adam spoke the Hebrew language because the names he gives Eve – \"Isha\" (Book of Genesis 2:23) and \"Chava\" (Genesis 3:20) – only make sense in Hebrew. By contrast, Kabbalism assumed an \"eternal Torah\" which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew. Thus, Abulafia in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in Paradise had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then-current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.\n\nUmberto Eco (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of Adam was preserved by Adam's descendants until the confusion of tongues (Genesis 11:1–9), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).\n\nDante Alighieri addresses the topic in his \"De vulgari eloquentia\" (1302-1305). He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable. He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to Eve, addressing the serpent, and not to Adam.\n\nIn his \"Divine Comedy\" (c. 1308-1320), however, Dante changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of Adam. This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes (\"Paradiso\" XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, \"El\", must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as \"I\".\n\nElizabethan scholar John Dee makes references to an occult or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of spirit medium Edward Kelley. Dee's journals did not describe the language as \"Enochian\", instead preferring \"Angelical\", the \"Celestial Speech\", the \"Language of Angels\", the \"First Language of God-Christ\", the \"Holy Language\", or \"Adamical\" because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to Dee's assertion that the Biblical Patriarch Enoch had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.\n\nDutch physician, linguist, and humanist Johannes Goropius Becanus (1519–1572) theorized in \"Origines Antwerpianae\" (1569) that Antwerpian Brabantic, spoken in the region between the Scheldt and Meuse Rivers, was the original language spoken in Paradise. Goropius believed that the most ancient language on Earth would be the simplest language, and that the simplest language would contain mostly short words. Since Brabantic has a higher number of short words than do Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, Goropius reasoned that it was the older language. His work influenced that of Simon Stevin (1548–1620), who espoused similar ideas in \"Uytspraeck van de weerdicheyt der Duytse tael\", a chapter in \"De Beghinselen Der Weeghconst\" (1586).\n\nBy the 17th century, the existence and nature of the alleged Adamic language was commonly discussed amongst European Jewish and Christian mystics and primitive linguists. Robert Boyle (1627–1691) was skeptical that Hebrew was the language best capable of describing the nature of things, stating:\nI could never find, that the Hebrew names of animals, mentioned in the beginning of Genesis, argued a (much) clearer insight into their natures, than did the names of the same or some other animals in Greek, or other languages (1665:45).\n\nJohn Locke (1632–1704) expressed similar skepticism in his \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690).\n\nJoseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, in his revision of the Bible, declared the Adamic language to have been \"pure and undefiled\". Some Latter Day Saints believe it to be the language of God. Glossolalia, or speaking in tongues, was commonplace in the early years of the movement, and it was commonly believed that the incomprehensible language spoken during these incidents was the language of Adam. However, this belief seems to have never been formally or officially adopted.\n\nSome other early Latter Day Saint leaders, including Brigham Young, Orson Pratt, and Elizabeth Ann Whitney, claimed to have received several words in the Adamic language by revelation. Some Latter Day Saints believe that the Adamic language is the \"pure language\" spoken of by Zephaniah and that it will be restored as the universal language of humankind at the end of the world.\n\nApostle Orson Pratt declared that \"Ahman\", part of the name of the settlement \"Adam-ondi-Ahman\" in Daviess County, Missouri, was the name of God in the Adamic language. An 1832 handwritten page from the Joseph Smith Papers, titled \"A Sample of the Pure Language\", and reportedly dictated by Smith to \"Br. Johnson\", asserts that the name of God is \"Awmen\".\n\nThe Latter Day Saint endowment prayer circle once included use of the words \"Pay Lay Ale\". These untranslated words are no longer used in temple ordinances and have been replaced by an English version, \"O God, hear the words of my mouth\". Some believe that the \"Pay Lay Ale\" sentence is derived from the Hebrew phrase \"pe le-El\" (), \"mouth to God\".\n\nOther words thought by some Latter Day Saints to derive from the Adamic language include \"deseret\" (\"honey bee\"), see Ether 2:3 and \"Ahman\" (\"God\") see Doctrine and Covenants 78:20 \n\nThe Book of Moses refers to \"a book of remembrance\" written in the language of Adam.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27124732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27124732", "title": "Anti-Hindi agitation of 1937–40", "text": "Anti-Hindi agitation of 1937–40\n\nThe Anti-Hindi imposition agitation of 1937–40 is a series of protests that happened in Madras Presidency of the British Raj during 1937-40. It was launched in 1937 in opposition to the introduction of compulsory teaching of Hindi in the schools of the presidency by the Indian National Congress government led by C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji). This move was immediately opposed by E. V. Ramasamy (Periyar) and the opposition Justice Party (later Dravidar Kazhagam). The agitation, which lasted three years, was multifaceted and involved fasts, conferences, marches, picketing and protests. The government responded with a crackdown resulting in the death of two protesters and the arrest of 1,198 persons including women and children. The mandatory Hindi education was later withdrawn by the British Governor of Madras Lord Erskine in February 1940 after the resignation of the Congress government in 1939.\n\nThe Republic of India has hundreds of languages. According to the Census of 2001, there are 1,635 rationalized mother tongues and 122 languages with more than 10,000 speakers. During the British Raj, English was the official language. When the Indian Independence Movement gained momentum in the early part of the 20th century, efforts were undertaken to make Hindustani as a common language to unite various linguistic groups against the British Government. As early as 1918, Mahatma Gandhi established the \"Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha\" (Institution for the Propagation of Hindi in South India). In 1925, the Indian National Congress switched to Hindustani from English for conducting its proceedings. Both Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were supporters of Hindustani and Congress wanted to propagate the learning of Hindustani in non-Hindi speaking Provinces of India. The idea of making Hindustani or Hindi the common language was not acceptable to Periyar, who viewed it as an attempt to make Tamils subordinate to North Indians.\n\nThe Indian National Congress won the 1937 elections in Madras Presidency. Rajaji became the Chief Minister on 14 July 1937. He was a supporter of propagating Hindi in South India. Even before the elections, he had expressed support for Hindi in a newspaper article (\"Sudesamithran\", 6 May 1937): \"Government employment is limited. All cannot get it. Therefore one has to search for other jobs. For that and for business, knowledge of Hindi is necessary. Only if we learn Hindi, the south Indian can gain respect among the others.\" On 11 August 1937, within a month of coming to power, he announced his intention to introduce Hindi language teaching in secondary schools by issuing a policy statement. This move followed lobbying by pro-Hindi organisations like \"Hindustani Seva Dal\" and \"Hindustani Hitashi Sabha\". These organisations had earlier convinced many Justice Party led local governments to introduce compulsory Hindi in schools in the early 1930s. Periyar and the opposition Justice Party led by A. T. Panneerselvam immediately opposed the move. An Anti-Hindi conference was organised on 4 October 1937 to protest the announcement. On 21 April 1938, Rajaji went ahead and passed a government order (G.O) making the teaching of Hindi compulsory in 125 Secondary schools in the Presidency. Rajaji's persistence was viewed by Hindi's opponents as an attempt to destroy Tamil and promote Hindi. They started statewide protests against Rajaji and Hindi. The agitation was marked by protest marches, anti-Hindi conferences, observing an anti-Hindi day (1 July and 3 December 1938), fasts against government policies, black flag demonstrations and picketing of government offices and institutions. It was active in Tamil speaking districts of the Presidency - Ramnad, Tirunelveli, Salem, Tanjore and North Arcot. The agitation lasted till the order was withdrawn in February 1940. Two persons -Thalamuthu and Natarajan - lost their lives. Around 1,200 people including Periyar were imprisoned.\n\nThe anti-Hindi agitation was backed by Periyar's Self-Respect Movement and Justice Party. The Justice party was led by older, established leaders like Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu and Pannirselvam, who did not have reputations as agitators and derived their power from patronage. Their representatives in the Madras Legislature demanded that the Hindi teaching be made optional. The more militant agitators led by Periyar did not have any patronage, but derived their influence from activism and politics of agitation. Periyar eventually became the president of the Justice Party during the course of the agitation. The agitation was also supported by Tamil scholars like Maraimalai Adigal, Somasundara Bharathi, K. Appadurai, Mudiyarasan, K. A. P. Viswanatham and Ilakkuvanar. In December 1937, Tamil Saivite scholars were among the first to announce their opposition to the Hindi teaching in the \"Saiva Sidhandha Maha Samaja\" conference at Velur. Women also participated in the agitation in large numbers. Moovalur Ramamirtham, Narayani, Va. Ba. Thamaraikani, Munnagar Azhagiyar, Dr. Dharmambal, Malar Mugathammaiyar, Pattammal and Seethammal were some of the women who were arrested for participating in the agitation. On 13 November 1938, the Tamil Nadu Women's Conference was convened to demonstrate women's support for the movement. Despite the anti-Brahmin sentiments of the backers of the agitation, a few Brahmins like Kanchi Rajagopalachari also participated in the movement.\nThe Tamil speaking Muslims in the Madras presidency supported the agitation (in contrast to the Urdu speaking Muslims, who supported the propagation of Hindi). P. Kalifulla, a Muslim League member representing Trichy in the Legislative Assembly, declared \"I may at once say that I am a Rowther myself; my mother tongue is Tamil and not Urdu. I am not ashamed of it; I am proud of it.. We have not been told why Hindi after all has been chosen as the common language of India\". Financial support for the agitation was provided by industrialists and landlords like W. P. A. Soundarapandian Nadar and G. D. Naidu. Acknowledging the agitation's popular support, Lord Erskine, the then Governor of Madras wrote to Viceroy Linlithgow in July 1938 that \"Compulsory Hindi has been the cause of great trouble in this province and is certainly contrary to the wishes of the bulk of the population...\"\n\nOn 1 May 1938, a young man named Stalin Jagadeesan went on a fast demanding the withdrawal of compulsory Hindi teaching. He became a symbol for the anti-Hindi agitators. In an interview published in Periyar's magazine \"Viduthalai\" he declared that his fast was to prove that \"Tamil Thai\" (lit. Mother Tamil) still had loyal sons. On 1 June, another man named Ponnusamy began a fast in front of Rajaji's house. Periyar did not approve of fasting as a form of protest. But other leaders of the agitation like C. N. Annadurai used Jagadeesan as an example. Annadurai declared in an anti-Hindi meeting that \"If Jagadeesan dies, I am ready to take his place, and die along with ten others. As soon as Jagadeesan dies, you should also be prepared to die\". Jagadeesan's fast was called off after ten weeks and it was reported that he had been eating regularly during the nights.\n\nA major feature of the agitation was the picketing of government offices and the schools where Hindi was being taught compulsorily. A boycott committee was formed on 1 June 1938 to coordinate the picketing. Rajaji's house in Mambalam, the Board High School at Tiruvarur and the Hindu Theosophical School at Triplicane, Madras became popular targets for the picketers. Most of the picketers in Madras city were not residents of the city and were bought from the outlying areas. Some of them were paid \"spending money\" to take part in the protests. Until October 1938, the picketing was relatively ineffective and contained. In that month Periyar started playing an active role in the agitation and the movement heated up. In November an anti-Hindi procession in Madras city turned violent and developed into a riot with protesters stoning the offices of \"Indian Express\", \"Ananda Vikatan\", \"Dina Mani\" and \"Tamil Mani\". With Periyar's fiery speeches motivating them, the agitators succeeded in provoking disproportionate response from the Police. The agitation which started relatively small, began to gain momentum.\n\nIn August–September 1938, a protest march was jointly organised by the Self-Respect movement and the Muslim league. It was flagged of by Periyar and Khaliffullah. The marchers who called themselves \"Tamilar Padai\" (lit. Tamil brigade), started from Trichy on 1 August 1938. They were led by Kumarasamy Pillai and Moovalur Ramamirtham. In the next 42 days, the marchers covered 234 villages and 60 towns. They addressed 87 public meetings and received widespread coverage in the press. They reached Madras on 11 September 1938 and were arrested for picketing government offices. The march succeeded in raising anti-Hindi and pro-Tamil support in smaller towns and villages they covered.\n\nTwo persons died during the agitation and were claimed as martyrs by the agitators. Their deaths fueled the protests further. Natarajan (a Paraiyar) was arrested On 5 December 1938. He was admitted to the hospital on the 30 December and died on 15 January 1939. On 13 February 1939, Thalamuthu Nadar was arrested with others for picketing the Hindu Theological High School in Madras. While imprisoned, he fell ill on 6 March and died on 11 March. The government claimed that his death was due to Cellulitis and Amoebic dysentery and he was already in poor health when he died. It dismissed their deaths and claimed they were illiterates. When the issue was raised in the Assembly, Rajaji dismissed it casually. The agitators were incensed by the government attitude and turned the dead men into martyrs. Their funeral processions in Madras were attended by hundreds of mourners and witnessed fiery speeches denouncing the government. Annadurai proclaimed that Natarajan’s name and deeds should be inscribed in gold in the history of the world. The agitators praised their sacrifices and claimed that the dead men had refused early release in exchange for ending their activities. In an interview given to the \"Sunday Observer\" on 27 January 1939, Natarajan's father K. Lakshmanan said when his son was hospitalized he refused to apologize to get an early release.\n\nThe anti-Hindi movement viewed the Hindi legislation as an attempt by Brahmins to impose Hindi and Sanskrit over Tamil. Rajaji's earlier attempt to translate an English Language Physics book into Tamil using Sanskrit words was viewed as proof of his preference of Sanskrit over Tamil. The anti-Hindi movement portrayed the Brahmin-dominated Tamil Nadu Congress party as a stooge of \"Hindi Imperialists\" from the North. The resistance of the Brahmin Tamil scholars for removing Sanskrit words from Tamil was viewed by some in the agitation as proof of Brahmin complicity in the attempt to destroy Tamil. Rajaji was identified as an enemy of Tamil. Dravidian movement newspapers carried cartoons depicting Rajaji hurling a dagger at \"Tamil Thai\" and disrobing her. Similar banners were displayed in the processions taken out by anti-Hindi agitators. In an anti-Hindi meeting organised in August 1938, Pavalar Balasundaram accused the Brahmin community of \"killing Tamil Thai\". Rajaji's dismissal of Natarasan's death in the Assembly was denounced as \"Aryans laughing while Tamils shed tears for their hero\". Rajaji complained that the agitators were describing their opponents \"by caste, by their sacred thread, by the tuft of the hair on their head\". In a riot that happened in Madras city in November 1938, acts of violence were committed against Brahmins by the agitators.\n\nThe ruling Congress Party was divided on the Hindi issue. While Rajaji and his supporters stuck to their position, Sathyamurti and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan were against it. They wanted Rajaji to make Hindi optional or to provide a conscience clause for allowing parents to withhold their children from Hindi Classes. Satyamurti also disagreed with the use of Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1932 against the anti-Hindi agitators. In a letter written to Mahatma Gandhi on 7 July 1938, he wrote:\nI personally believe that where a parent or guardian swears an affidavit before a magistrate stating his reasons that it is against his conscience that his boy or girl should learn Hindustani compulsorily, the child may be exempted. I personally believe very few parents or guardians will claim this exemption. This will expose the hollowness of the agitation and kill it. I wish you to write to Sri. C. Rajagopalachari suggesting this to him. Moreover, I am not very happy over the use by the Madras Government of the Criminal Law Amendment Act against these picketers.\n\nRajaji defended his action in another G.O. issued on 14 June 1938:\n\nHe refused to give in to the demands of the agitators. He claimed they were motivated by their \"prejudices of anti-aryanism\" and \"hatred of the Congress\". The police response to the agitation grew progressively brutal in 1939. Rajaji used the Criminal Law Amendment Act against the agitators, so that they could be charged of \"non-bailable\" criminal offenses. Displeased by his high handedness, Governor Erskine complained: \"..[Rajaji] was too much of a Tory for me, for though I may want to go back twenty years, he wishes to go back two thousand and to run India as it was run in the time of King Ashoka\". During the agitation, a total of 1,198 protesters were arrested and out of them 1,179 were convicted (73 of those jailed were women and some of them went to jail with their children; 32 children accompanied their mothers to prison). Periyar was fined 1,000 Rupees and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment for inciting \"women to disobey the law\" (he was released within six months on 22 May 1939 citing medical grounds) and Annadurai was jailed for four months. On 7 June 1939, all those arrested for participating in the agitations were released without explanation. Rajaji also organised pro-Hindustani meetings to counter the agitators.\n\nOn 29 October 1939, Rajaji's Congress Government resigned protesting the involvement of India in the Second World War. Madras provincial government was placed under Governor's rule. On 31 October, Periyar suspended the agitation and asked the Governor to withdraw the compulsory Hindi order. On 21 February 1940, Governor Erskine, issued a press communique withdrawing compulsory Hindi teaching and making it optional.\n\nThe anti-Hindi agitations of 1937-40 led to a change of guard in the Madras Presidency. The main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state, the Justice Party, came under Periyar's leadership on 29 December 1938. In 1944, the Justice Party was renamed as Dravidar Kazhagam. The political careers of many later leaders of the Dravidian Movement, such as C. N. Annadurai, started with their participation in these agitations. The agitations stopped the compulsory teaching of Hindi in the state. The agitations also reshaped the Dravidian Movement and broadened its political base, when it shifted from its earlier pro-Tamil (and anti-Brahmin) stance to a more inclusive one, which was both anti-Hindi and pro-English. \nIn the words of Sumathi Ramaswamy (Professor of History at Duke University),\n\n[The anti-Hindi agitations knit] together diverse, even incompatible, social and political interests... Their common cause against Hindi had thrown together religious revivalists like Maraimalai Atikal (1876-1950) with avowed atheists like Ramasami and Bharathidasan (1891-1964); men who supported the Indian cause like T.V. Kalyanasundaram (1883-1953) and M. P. Sivagnanam with dravidian movement supporters like Annadurai; university professors like Somasundara Bharati (1879-1959) and M.S. Purnalingam Pillai (1866 -1947) with uneducated street poets, populist pamphleteers and college students.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4741500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4741500", "title": "Capo dei capi", "text": "Capo dei capi\n\nCapo di tutti i capi or capo dei capi is Italian for \"boss of all bosses\" or \"boss of [the] bosses\". It is a phrase used mainly by the media, public and the law enforcement community to indicate a supremely powerful crime boss in the Sicilian or American Mafia who holds great influence over the whole organization. The term was introduced to the U.S. public by the Kefauver Commission (1950).\n\nThe word was applied by mobsters to Giuseppe Morello around 1900, according to Nick Gentile. Bosses Joe Masseria (1928–1931) and Salvatore Maranzano (1931) used the title as part of their efforts to centralize control of the Mafia under themselves. When Maranzano won the Castellammarese War, he set himself up as boss of all bosses and ordered every Mafia family to pay him tribute. This provoked a rebellious reaction which led to him being murdered. Lucky Luciano then created The Commission in 1931 as an alternative.\n\nThe Commission consisted of the bosses of the Five Families in New York and some non New York families. These men had equal say in Mafia matters. Since then, the title of boss of all bosses has been given by the media to the most powerful boss, although the Mafia never recognized the position itself. Genovese crime family bosses Lucky Luciano (1931–1946), Frank Costello (1946–1957) and Vito Genovese (1957–1959) were given the title. Following Genovese, Joseph Bonanno, boss of the Bonanno crime family, chaired the commission in 1959–1962.\n\nWith the rise of Carlo Gambino, the Gambino crime family became the most powerful crime family and he was given the title from 1962–1976, as were his successors Paul Castellano (1976–1985), and John Gotti (1985–1992). With the fall of Gotti, Genovese Boss Vincent Gigante held the title from 1992–1997. The term has since fallen out of use. Bonanno family boss Joseph Massino was recognized by four of the five families as chairman of the Commission from 2000 to 2004; during this time he was the only full-fledged boss in New York not in prison.\n\nIn the Sicilian Mafia the position does not exist. For instance, the old-style Mafia boss Calogero Vizzini was often portrayed in the media as the \"boss of bosses\" – although such a position does not exist according to later Mafia \"pentiti\", such as Tommaso Buscetta. They also denied Vizzini ever was the ruling boss of the Mafia in Sicily. According to Mafia historian Salvatore Lupo \"the emphasis of the media on the definition of 'capo dei capi' is without any foundation\".\n\nNevertheless, the title has frequently been given to powerful Mafia bosses to this day. During the 1980s and 1990s the bosses of the Corleonesi clan Salvatore Riina and Bernardo Provenzano were bestowed with the title by the media.\n\nIn April 2006, the Italian government arrested Bernardo Provenzano in a small farmhouse near the town of Corleone. His successor is reported to be either Matteo Messina Denaro or Salvatore Lo Piccolo. This presupposes that Provenzano has the power to nominate a successor, which is not unanimously accepted among Mafia observers. \"The Mafia today is more of a federation and less of an authoritarian state\", according to anti-Mafia prosecutor Antonio Ingroia of the Direzione distrettuale antimafia (DDA) of Palermo, referring to the previous period of authoritarian rule under Salvatore Riina.\n\nProvenzano \"established a kind of directorate of about four to seven people who met very infrequently, only when necessary, when there were strategic decisions to make\".

{"id": "31049226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31049226", "title": "Full spectrum diplomacy", "text": "Full spectrum diplomacy\n\nFull spectrum diplomacy is a combination of traditional, government-to-government diplomacy with the many components of public diplomacy as well as the integration of these two functions with other instruments of statecraft. The term was coined by Dr. John Lenczowski, the Founder and President of the Institute of World Politics in Washington, D.C. in his book \"Full Spectrum Diplomacy and Grand Strategy: Reforming the Structure and Culture of U.S. Foreign Policy\" which was released in May, 2011.\n\nLenczowski's book appears to be the first attempt to isolate and define the term. In it, he references the military concept of \"full spectrum operations\" (or \"full spectrum dominance\") indicating that it inspired his derivation for diplomatic use. He writes that the diplomatic community does not have a comparable term to full spectrum operations, \"but there should be, in order to end the systematic neglect of some dimensions of the larger art of diplomacy.\"\n\nIn a chapter of the \"Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy\", Matthew Armstrong provides a historical perspective on the use of full spectrum diplomatic action:\n\nFull spectrum diplomacy is an integrated strategy that encompasses all instruments of engagement including traditional diplomacy and public diplomacy. Of particular note is advocacy for the use of cultural diplomacy to enhance contact with people at the grassroots level.\n\nTo increase the role of public diplomacy, Lenczowski advocates the foundation of a U.S. Public Diplomacy Agency. This would not only take the place of the former United States Information Agency (USIA), but would expand to coordinate all aspects of the public diplomacy instrument. Dr. Juliana Pilon advocates a similar organization in her book \"Why America is Such a Hard Sell\" in which she promotes an \"American Global Outreach and Research Agency.\" Her idea culminates in a system that links the instruments of public diplomacy throughout the whole of government. Yet another proposal is that of Professor Carnes Lord of the Naval War College writing for the creation of a \"Policy Coordinating Committee on Foreign Information, Assistance, and Democracy Promotion\" that would serve to integrate the leadership of the many organizations involved in public diplomacy to other agencies of strategic influence.\n\nLenczowski provides further explanation of the construct here:\n\nIn support of the concept of full spectrum diplomacy, Lenczowski writes that \"the achievement of foreign policy goals requires a multiplicity of means that can be likened to instruments in an orchestra.\" Additionally, he states that \"the conduct of full spectrum diplomacy thus involves the proper orchestration of both traditional and public diplomacy in such a fashion that the policies governing each function do not jeopardize the effectiveness of the other.\"\n\nThis collected orchestration becomes a part of what Lenczowski calls an “integrated strategy” defined by \"a concept that requires the coordination of all the instruments of statecraft, including military policy, intelligence, counterintelligence, economic policy, etc.\"\n\nA previous use of this musical ensemble analogy for an instrument of statecraft is found in a World War II Soviet anti-Nazi espionage element commonly known as the Red Orchestra.\n\nThe purpose of full spectrum diplomacy is to promote what Lenczowski calls an \"influence culture.\" This environment includes a more versatile diplomatic corps to accompany an increased focus on public diplomacy. It is a comprehensive approach that will employ many of the elements of what Harvard professor Joseph Nye calls soft power and what a number of scholars and government officials refer to as smart power. The influence culture and resulting integrated strategy of the \"orchestra\" allow for a broader international approach. In lieu of too quickly resorting to hard power such as military action, the engagement of full spectrum diplomacy provides for a variety of possible non-military actions that could pre-empt the need for armed conflict.\n\nScholars have been calling for this approach to American grand strategy for years. Paul Kennedy writes that the U.S. \"needs to integrate its political, economic, and military aims in a coherent fashion, for years of peace as well as the possibility of war.\" In his book \"Soft Power\", Joseph Nye asserts that \"America's success will depend upon our developing a deeper understanding of the role of soft power and developing a better balance of hard and soft power in our foreign policy.\". The resulting \"smart power\" provides a distinct tie-in to the idea of full spectrum diplomacy. Finally, Professor Colin S. Gray calls for a \"fully functioning 'strategy bridge' that binds together, adaptably, the realms of policy and military behavior.\".\n\nThough a relatively new term in the lexicon of statecraft, full spectrum diplomacy is already found in reference to contemporary events. In a February 28, 2011 commentary piece from the \"U.N. Dispatch\", Mark Leon Goldberg references the term in the title: \"The Obama Administration’s Full Spectrum Diplomacy on Libya.\" In defense of the Obama Administration's strategy in the North African nation, he writes that: \"After the unanimous passage of a strong Security Council resolution on Libya on Saturday, there appears to be a full spectrum diplomatic push led by the Obama administration to make sure that the provisions called for in the resolution are swiftly and effectively imposed.\"\n\nOther references, which occur prior to Lenczowski's initial use of the term, utilize similar terminology or imply the same conceptual framework.\n\nIn March 2009 Congressional testimony, George Moose, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, urged the development of a larger and more versatile diplomatic corps:\n\nIn a July 2006 article promoting 'full spectrum analysis' at the strategic level, Adrian Wolfberg, the director of the Knowledge Laboratory at the Defense Intelligence Agency, wrote that \"the warfighter now operates along many lines at once and across a full spectrum of possible actions, either diplomatic, intelligence-driven, military, or economic in nature.\n\n\n"}

The stance is usually far from the centrist view. People, policies, and laws can be considered hard-line. Other words used to describe policy positions or people's views can imply a hard-line position.\n\nThe French government has taken a hard-line stance against terrorism. France removed restrictions on raiding houses of suspected terrorists, although only five cases have been brought to court while over four thousand searches were conducted. Critics say the approach unfairly blames the Muslim community for radical extremists.\n\nEbrahim Raisi, a Shi'ite cleric and prominent politician, ran as a hard-line challenger to President Rouhani in 2017 and was Rouhani's main challenger. He ran primarily on economic reforms and increasing distance with the West.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu will not make concessions on either holding Jerusalem to be the true capital of Israel or rejecting a two-state solution on Palestine in negotiations.\n\nAfter increased sanctions by Western countries, a poll from 2016 recorded that fifty-nine percent of Russians did not want their government to change its behavior. The respondents felt that either Westerns wanted to harm Russia, hold it to standards they did not live up to, or were simply ignorant of Russian reasoning for actions.\n\nBrexit is a hard-line position on relations with the European Union. The United Kingdoms voted to leave the European Union to preserve its sovereignty, which was dubbed Brexit. After the vote, the two top searches on Google about the European Union were the implications of leaving the European Union and what \"EU\" (short for European Union) meant.\n\nOne of the more common issues that uses hard-line or hardliner as a description is illegal immigration. For example, the United States House of Representatives had two bills in June 2018 about immigration to consider: the hard-line and centrist options. The House failed to pass the centrist bill. The House did not vote on the more extreme bill.\n\nA hawk is someone who prefers an extreme or aggressive stance, typically on war. When referring to war, a hawk is always in favor of war. The opposite is a dove, who prefers peace. However, the term hawk can also be used for other issues, like the deficit. John McCain, the American senator and 2008 presidential nominee was a [war] hawk because of his policies on the Middle East. A current example of a hawk is John R. Bolton, who is the national security advisor for President Trump as of 10/12/18.\n"}

A dance-pop and tropical house recording, the single was generally acclaimed by music critics, who praised it as an earworm with Middle Eastern influences. While reviews noted lyrics in English, French, and Spanish, the singer explained that the refrain was written in a language she invented with her label. At the 2017 Radio România Actualități Awards, \"Heaven\" was nominated in three categories.\n\nAn accompanying music video was posted onto YouTube on 7 June 2016 after a teaser premiered on 3 June 2016; it was shot by John Perez in Shangri-La, Mauritius, in April 2016. The clip portrays Inna at a seaside resort community with a love interest, played by Mauritian actor Olivier Phineas Boissard.

The upcoming premiere of a second version of the song, featuring a \"well-known\" artist, was announced, but never materialized. Several remixes of the track were also made available for consumption as stand-alone releases or on a remix extended play. About the track, Inna said that she was \"very happy to release 'Heaven'. It is one of the songs which [she] fell in love with after the first hear and one which [her] fans waited for impatiently. It's the ideal sound for the summer and [she hopes] you will enjoy it.\"\n\nWhile El Broide of \"People Magazine\" wrote that the single is performed in English and French, website Aficia's Valentin Malfroy noted that Spanish is also incorporated, also pointing out a male voice providing vocals for the refrain sung with a strong African accent.

So we thought to create an own language. If the ones from \"Game of Thrones\" can do it, then why can't we do it as well?\" \"People Magazine\" called the track a \"catchy\" tropical house song that \"effortlessly blends together\" tropical sounds with a Middle Eastern flair, along with \"simple and cheesy\" lyrics. Jonathan Currinn from \"Outlet Magazine\" labelled \"Heaven\" an \"exotic anthem\", while Urban.ro called it a dance-pop song with exotic elements. Radio 21 noted that the track seemed to be influenced by Arabic rhythms.\n\nUpon its release, the recording was met with mostly positive reviews. \"People Magazine\" praised the song's production, calling it \"the perfect track to play at the pool or a beach holiday\" and \"something different from anything on radio at the moment\". Though the review criticized Inna's pronunciation of the lyrics and wished the text was stronger, it concluded: \"this is definitely a song that we need on our summer playlist\". \"Outlet Magazine\" applauded \"Heaven\" for \"bringing the summer heat\" and for being \"the ideal song to sit outside and listen to all day long as the sun's rays caress your skin\". Urban.ro foresaw it as being successful on radios, and an editor of Pro FM listed the recording in their list of \"16 hits with which Inna made history\".

{"id": "557664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=557664", "title": "Heel (professional wrestling)", "text": "Heel (professional wrestling)\n\nIn professional wrestling, a heel (also known as a \"rudo\" in \"lucha libre\") is a wrestler who portrays a villain or a \"bad guy\" and acts as an antagonist to the faces, who are the heroic protagonist or \"good guy\" characters. \n\nTo gain heat (with boos and jeers from the audience), heels are often portrayed as behaving in an immoral manner by breaking rules or otherwise taking advantage of their opponents outside the bounds of the standards of the match. Others do not (or rarely) break rules, but instead exhibit unlikeable, appalling and deliberately offensive and demoralizing personality traits such as arrogance, cowardice or contempt for the audience. Many heels do both, cheating as well as behaving nastily. No matter the type of heel, the most important job is that of the antagonist role, as heels exist to provide a foil to the face wrestlers. If a given heel is cheered over the face, a promoter may opt to turn that heel to face or the other way around, or to make the wrestler do something even more despicable to encourage heel heat.\n\nIn American wrestling it was common for the faces to be American (e.g. Hulk Hogan) and the heels to be portrayed as foreign (e.g. Alberto El Patrón, Ivan Koloff, The Iron Sheik, Rusev, Jinder Mahal and Muhammad Hassan).\n\nIn the world of \"lucha libre\" wrestling, heels are generally known for being brawlers and for using physical moves that emphasize brute strength or size, often having outfits akin to demons, devils, or other tricksters. This is contrasted with the heroic \"técnicos\" that are generally known for using moves requiring technical skill, particularly aerial maneuvers.\n\nCommon heel behavior includes cheating to win (e.g. using the ropes for leverage while pinning or attacking with foreign objects while the referee is looking away), employing dirty tactics such as blatant chokes or raking the eyes, attacking other wrestlers backstage, interfering with other wrestlers' matches, insulting the fans or city they are in (referred to as \"cheap heat\") and acting in a haughty or superior manner.\nMore theatrical heels would feature dramatic outfits giving off a nasty or otherwise dangerous look, such as wearing corpse paint over their faces, putting on demonic masks, covering themselves in dark leather and the like. Gorgeous George is regarded as the father of the wrestling gimmick and by extension the heel gimmick. Starting in the 1940s, he invented an extravagant, flamboyant \"pretty boy\" gimmick who wore wavy blonde hair, colorful robes and ritzy outfits and was accompanied by beautiful valets to the ring for his matches. The crowd widely jeered his persona and came out to his matches in hopes of seeing him defeated. He in turn relished in it and exploded in to the one of the most famous (and hated) heels not only of his era, but of all time. Another example of a dramatic looking heel is the wrestler The Undertaker (in his heel roles). During his period in The Ministry of Darkness, he undertook performances where he would appear as a priest of the occult in a hooded black robe and sit on a devilish throne.\n\nOccasionally, faces who have recently turned from being heels still exhibit characteristics from their heel persona. This occurs due to fans being entertained by a wrestler despite (or because of) their heel persona, often due to the performer's charisma or charm in playing the role. Certain wrestlers such as Eddie Guerrero and Ric Flair gained popularity as faces by using tactics that would typically be associated with heels, while others like Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Scott Hall displayed heelish behavior through most of their careers yet got big face reactions, leading them to be marketed as Antiheroes.\n\nOn other occasions, wrestlers who are positioned as faces receive a negative audience reaction despite their portrayal as heroes. An example is Roman Reigns, who in 2018 is a top face in WWE, but gets booed in his matches while his opponents gets cheered regardless of them being face or heel, due to perceived favoritism from WWE bookers and executive and a lack of character development. Such characters often (but not always) become nudged into becoming villains over time or retooled to present a different public image, such as The Rock's heel turn from a clean-cut face to self-absorbed narcissist in the heel Nation of Domination stable. The term heel does not describe a typical set of attributes or audience reaction by itself, but simply a wrestler's presentation and booking as an antagonist. \n\nDepending on the angle, a heel can act cowardly or overpowering to their opponents. For instance, a \"closet champion\" in particular is a term for a heel in possession of a title belt who consistently dodges top flight competition and attempts to back down from challenges. One of many examples is Seth Rollins during his first WWE World Heavyweight Championship run, Charlotte during her Divas/Raw Women's Championship reign, the Honky Tonk Man during his long Intercontinental Championship reign, and Tommaso Ciampa during his NXT Championship reign. This helps to affirm the intended kayfabe reactions that the face(s) that said heel is feuding with is/are more deserving of the title. Heels may in fact beg for mercy during a beat down at the hands of faces, even if they have delivered similar beat downs with no mercy, with Ric Flair in particular being well known for this. Other heels may act overpowering to their opponents as to play up the scrappy underdog success story for the face instead. Brock Lesnar has played heel in both capacities, but has become quite famous (either as a heel or a face) as an almost-unstoppable machine who can take down anything in his path.\n\n"}

He published widely.\n\nJames Ross was born October 9, 1931, in Providence, Rhode Island, and died in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 12, 2010. He was son of the James Joseph and Teresa (Sullivan) Ross. His father was a pharmacist and his mother a school teacher. In 1956 he married Kathleen Fallon, a nurse from Providence, who died on May 23, 2010.\n\nHe received his A.B. (1953) and A.M. (1954) from Catholic University of America, Ph.D. (1958) from Brown University, and J.D. (1974) from the University of Pennsylvania. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar in 1975. James Ross began his academic career in the Philosophy Department at the University of Michigan initially as an instructor (1959–61) and then as an Assistant Professor (1961–62). In 1962 he joined the University of Pennsylvania and remained there until his death, as an assistant professor from 1962 to 1965, an associate professor from 1965 to 1968, and from 1968 onwards as a full professor. He held a number of visiting appointments including Visiting Lecturer Johns Hopkins (1964–65), the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton) during the 1975–6 academic year, and Darwin College Cambridge University from September 1982 through December 1983. His research at the Institute for Advanced Study was supported by an NEH grant to the Institute. He also led a 1977 NEH Summer Seminar at Brown University, titled Faith, Meaning and Religious Knowledge. From 1984 to 1986 he was the president of the Society for Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy.\n\nHe researched, taught, and wrote in the fields of medieval philosophy, philosophy of language, law, and religion. In a career that spanned more than five decades, he produced more than 100 articles, a number of translations, and four books. In the last book published before he died, \"Thought and World\" (2008) he argues that meaning, truth, impossibility, natural necessity, and our intelligent perception of nature fit together into a distinctly realist account of thought and world. He articulates a moderate realism about repeatable natural structures and our abstractive ability to discern them that poses a challenge to many of the common assumptions and claims of contemporary analytic philosophy. He develops a broadly Aristotelian metaphysics that recognizes the \"hidden necessities\" of things, which are disclosed through the sciences.\n\nJames Ross' scholarly examination of Analogy began with his doctoral thesis at Brown University (1958), led to such seminal articles as \"Analogy as a Rule of Meaning for Religious Language\" (1961) and \"Analogy and the Resolution of Some Cognitivity Problems\" (1970), and eventually to a monograph, \"Portraying Analogy\" (1981), which was the first fundamental examination of the topic since Cajetan (Thomas Cajetan) in 1498.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Abriol (February 4, 1918 – July 6, 2003) was a Filipino Catholic priest, linguist, and high official in the church in the Philippines. He was the first to translate the Bible into Tagalog, the native language for most Filipinos.\n\nAbriol was ordained to the priesthood on May 14, 1942. He translated the Holy Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek. Apart from this, he also became the rector of the Manila Cathedral from 1962 to 1975, and at the same time was the chancellor of the Archdiocese of Manila. He was fluent in nine languages, namely Spanish, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, English, German, and Filipino (Tagalog). He served as a priest for sixty years and died at the age of 85. He is regarded as one of the \"great intellectuals of the Philippine Church and the world.\"\n\nAs a priest who yearned to propagate the Roman Catholic faith in the Philippines, Abriol wrote and translated hundreds of books and novenas into the Filipino language. Among his works are the very first translation of the complete books of the Catholic Bible into Tagalog (also known as Pilipino), literature on Roman Catholic Cathecism, the Order of Mass and the rest of the Roman Missal, and the Lectionary. He translated the Holy Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek while serving as rector of the Cathedral of Manila, a period encompassing ten years of his life. From 1953 to 1963, he allotted five hours a day for this task. Among the 69 to 70 books he authored – excluding his other translation works – were lives of saints, prayers to the Virgin Mary, Sunday missals, the \"Via Crucis\" (or Way of the Cross), and the \"Siete Palabras\" (Spanish for the Seven Last Words of Christ). Before the year 2000, he was also able to finish his translation of Pope John Paul II's encyclical \"Fides et Ratio\" (\"Faith and Reason\"), which became \"Pananampalataya at Katwiran\" in Tagalog.\n\nApart from being rector of the Manila Cathedral and chancellor for the Archdiocese of Manila from 1962 to 1975, Abriol served as parish priest for the parishes of St. Michael the Archangel at Jala-Jala, Rizal (1947–1951), of San Rafael, Balut, Tondo in Manila (1951–1962), and of the Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene at Quiapo, Manila (1976–1993). He was also a member of the Manila Archdiocesan Commission for the Conservation of the Patrimony of the Art and History of the Church, from 1993 through 1999. He was the Vicar General for the Archdiocese of Manila for 38 years from 1965 to July 2003. He was also the first director of Manila's Archdiocese Museum which houses his own \"personal collections and church treasures\" formerly safeguarded inside a bank vault. While serving as a parish priest at the Basilica of the Black Nazarene in Quiapo, Manila, Abriol established the St. Peter’s Men Society, a group that \"defended Catholicism in Plaza Miranda against anti-Catholics and employed radio technology to communicate and explain the Biblical foundation of the Catholic faith\" to the Filipino people.

Originally, it was widely used both for literary and official purposes, though seldom in daily language. In the 20th century, it was increasingly adopted for official and formal purposes, until minister of education Georgios Rallis made Demotic Greek the official language of Greece in 1976, and later in 1982 Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou abolished the polytonic system of writing both for Demotic and Katharevousa.\n\nKatharevousa was conceived by the intellectual and revolutionary leader Adamantios Korais (1748–1833). A graduate of the University of Montpellier, Korais spent most of his life as an expatriate in Paris. Being a classical scholar, he was repelled by the Byzantine and later influence on Greek society and was a fierce critic of the clergy and their alleged subservience to the Ottoman Empire. He held that education was a prerequisite to Greek liberation.\n\nPart of Katharevousa's purpose was to mediate the struggle between the \"archaists\" favouring full reversion to archaic forms and the \"modernists\".\n\nThe first known use of the term \"katharevousa\" is in a work by the Greek polymath Nikephoros Theotokis, in 1796.\n\nKatharevousa was widely used in public documents and whatever was conceived as work of formal activity by Greek scholars. The name \"Katharevousa\" implies a pure form of Greek as it might hypothetically have evolved from ancient Greek without external influences, while in its modern connotation the word has come to mean \"formal language\".\n\nIn later years, Katharevousa was used for official and formal purposes (such as politics, letters, official documents, and newscasting), while Demotic Greek (δημοτική, \"dimotiki\") or popular Greek, was the daily language. This created a diglossic situation whereby most of the Greek population was excluded from the public sphere and advancement in education unless they conformed to Katharevousa. In 1976, Demotic was made the official language, and in 1982 Andreas Papandreou abolished the polytonic system of writing; by the end of the 20th century full Katharevousa in its earlier form had become obsolete. Much of the vocabulary of Katharevousa and its grammatical and syntactical rules have influenced the Demotic language, so that the project's emphasis has made an observable contribution to the language as it is used today. Modern Greek might be argued to be a combination of the original Demotic and the traditional Katharevousa as stressed in the 19th century, also with institutional input from Koine Greek. Amongst Katharevousa's later contributions is the promotion of classically based compounds to describe items and concepts that did not exist in earlier times, such as \"newspaper\", \"police\", \"automobile\", \"aeroplane\", \"television\" and many others, rather than borrowing new words directly from other languages.\n\nThe Church of Greece and other churches of the Greek Orthodox tradition still use Katharevousa in official communications.\n\nThis is a text sample of Katharevousa from the \"Great Greek Encyclopedia\", published in 1930. The text has to do with Adamantios Korais's relations with the Greek Church. It is rendered in Demotic and translated into English.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Additionally, Nicaragua has four extinct indigenous languages.\n\nSpanish, or Nicañol as Nicaraguan Spanish is sometimes referred to, is spoken by 90% of the country's population. In Nicaragua the Voseo form is common, just as in other countries in Central and South America such as Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, coastal parts of Colombia, Honduras or Paraguay. Spanish has many different dialects spoken throughout Latin America, Central American Spanish is the dialect spoken in Nicaragua.\n\n\nSome characteristics of Nicaraguan phonology include:\n\nEnglish is also spoken among Nicaraguans, expats from the United States and Canada, and widely used by the tourism sector. On the Caribbean coast, due to the African and English heritage, in places like Bluefields and on the Corn Islands, the English language is spoken in the form of English creole by the majority of the population there, coexisting with indigenous languages.\n\nSeveral indigenous peoples on the Caribbean coast still use their native language, the main languages being Miskito language, Sumo language, and Rama language. Other Indigenous languages spoken include Garifuna.\n\nMiskito is a Misumalpan language spoken by the Miskito people in northeastern Nicaragua along the Caribbean coast, especially in the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region. The Miskito language is the most widely spoken indigenous language in Nicaragua, this is because the Miskito people also hold the highest population of Indigenous people in the country.\n\nSumo (also known as Sumu) is a Misumalpan language spoken in Nicaragua by the Sumo people. There is wide dialectal variation, and sometimes the major dialects may be listed as separate languages.\n\nRama is one of the indigenous languages of the Chibchan family spoken by the Rama people on the island of Rama Cay and south of lake Bluefields on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. The Rama language is severely endangered. Their language was described as \"dying quickly for lack of use\" as early as the 1860s. By 1980, the Rama were noted as having \"all but lost their original ethnic language\", and had become speakers of a form of English creole instead, Rama Cay Creole which is spoken by 8,000–9,000 people.\n\nLanguage revival efforts began in 1980–1981 under the Sandinistas however, they were not successful. The fieldwork for the first dictionary of Rama was done during this time by Robin Schneider, a graduate student from the University of Berlin. In 1992, only approximately 36 fluent speakers could be found among an ethnic population of 649 individuals in 1992, of whom only a few scattered individuals live outside Nicaragua. The number of speakers on Rama Cay island was only 4 in 1992, due to language shift to English that engendered Rama Cay Creole.\n\nNicaraguan Sign Language has been of particular interest to linguists as one of the few languages whose birth was recorded.\n\nNicaragua has many minority groups. Many ethnic groups in Nicaragua, such as the Chinese Nicaraguans and Palestinian Nicaraguans, have maintained their ancestral languages while also speaking Spanish and/or English. Minority languages include Chinese, Arabic, German, Italian among others.\n\nNicaragua has a total of 4 extinct languages:\n\nNahuat, also known as Pipil-Nicarao, is a dialect of the Nahuatl language, belonging to the Uto-Aztecan language family. This language was spoken by the Pipil-Nicarao people, also referred to simply as the Nicaraos. Nahuat became the lingua franca during the 16th century. A hybrid form of Nahuat-Spanish was spoken by many Nicaraguans up until the 19th century.\n\nThe Mangue language, also known as Chorotega, consisted of several dialects spoken in western Nicaragua by Chorotega natives. Mangue is a language closely related to the Chiapanec language spoken in Mexico, and is classified as belonging to the Oto-Manguean language family. In the Monimbó neighborhood of the city of Masaya, there are many Chorotega natives but the language that they speak is Spanish.\n\nThe Subtiaba language was an Oto-Manguean language which was spoken on the Pacific slope of Nicaragua by the indigenous Subtiaba people (also sometimes referred to as Maribios, Hokan Xiu, or Xiu-Subtiabas). In 1925, Edward Sapir wrote an article based on scant evidence arguing for the inclusion of Subtiaba in his hypothesized Hokan languages group. Others have linked Subtiaba to the Jicaque and Tol languages of Honduras, but it is generally accepted that Subtiaba is an Oto-Manguean language that shares a close affinity with the Tlapanec language of Mexico. When Sapir wrote about Subtiaba in 1925, it was already very endangered or moribund.\n\nThe Matagalpa language was a Misumalpan language spoken by the indigenous Matagalpa people. In 1981, the population of the Matagalpa people was estimated at 18,000–20,000. The Matagalpa people live in the Central highlands of Nicaragua in the departments of Matagalpa and Jinotega. Matagalpa became extinct in the 19th century; the eponymous people now speak Spanish. Only a few short word lists remain. It was closely related to the Cacaopera language.\n\n\n"}

The theorem was proved by David Muller and Paul Schupp in 1983.\n\nLet \"G\" be a finitely generated group with a finite marked generating set \"X\", that is a set \"X\" together with the map formula_1 such that the subset formula_2 generates \"G\". Let formula_3 be the group alphabet and let formula_4 be the free monoid on formula_5 that is formula_4 is the set of all words (including the empty word) over the alphabet formula_7. \nThe map formula_8 extends to a surjective monoid homomorphism, still denoted by formula_9, formula_10.\nThe \"word problem\" formula_11 of \"G\" with respect to \"X\" is defined as \nwhere formula_13 is the identity element of \"G\".\n\nThat is, if \"G\" is given by a presentation formula_14 with \"X\" finite, then formula_11 consists of all words over the alphabet formula_16 that are equal to formula_17 in \"G\".\n\nA group \"G\" is said to be virtually free if there exists a subgroup of finite index \"H\" in \"G\" such that \"H\" is isomorphic to a free group. If \"G\" is a finitely generated virtually free group and \"H\" is a free subgroup of finite index in \"G\" then \"H\" itself is finitely generated, so that \"H\" is free of finite rank.\nThe trivial group is viewed as the free group of rank 0, and thus all finite groups are virtually free.\n\nA basic result in Bass–Serre theory says that a finitely generated group \"G\" is virtually free if and only if \"G\" splits as the fundamental group of a finite graph of finite groups.\n\nThe modern formulation of the Muller–Schupp theorem is as follows:\n\nLet \"G\" be a finitely generated group with a finite marked generating set \"X\". Then \"G\" is virtually free if and only if formula_11 is a context-free language.\n\nThe exposition in this section follows the original 1983 proof of Muller and Schupp.\n\nSuppose \"G\" is a finitely generated group with a finite generating set \"X\" such that the word problem formula_11 is a context-free language. One first observes that for every finitely generated subgroup \"H\" of \"G\" is finitely presentable and that for every finite marked generating set \"Y\" of \"H\" the word problem formula_20 is also context-free. In particular, for a finitely generated group the property of having context word problem does not depend on the choice of a finite marked generating set for the group, and such a group is finitely presentable.\n\nMuller and Schupp then show, using the context-free grammar for the language formula_11, that the Cayley graph formula_22 of \"G\" with respect to \"X\" is \"K-triangulable\" for some integer \"K\">0. This means that every closed path in formula_22 can be, by adding several ``diagonals\", decomposed into triangles in such a way that the label of every triangle is a relation in \"G\" of length at most \"K\" over \"X\".\n\nThey then use this triangulability property of the Cayley graph to show that either \"G\" is a finite group, or \"G\" has more than one end. Hence, by a theorem of Stallings, either \"G\" is finite or \"G\" splits nontrivially as an amalgamated free product formula_24 or an HNN-extension formula_25 where \"C\" is a finite group. Then formula_26 are again finitely generated groups with context-free word-problem, and one can apply the entire preceding argument to them.\n\nSince \"G\" is finitely presentable and therefore accessible, the process of iterating this argument eventually terminates with finite groups, and produces a decomposition of \"G\" as the fundamental group of a finite graph-of-groups with finite vertex and edge groups. By a basic result of Bass–Serre theory it then follows that \"G\" is virtually free.\n\nThe converse direction of the Muller–Schupp theorem is more straightforward. If \"G\" is a finitely generated virtually free group, then \"G\" admits a finite index normal subgroup \"N\" such that \"N\" is a finite rank free group. Muller and Schupp use this fact to directly verify that \"G\" has context-free word problem.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is usually slower than letter post. The development of the parcel post is closely connected with the development of the railway network which enabled parcels to be carried in bulk, to a regular schedule and at economic prices. Today many parcels also travel by road and international shipments may travel by sea or airmail.\n\nThe idea of a parcel post may be credited to Germany, where the growth of railways had brought uniform postal rates throughout Germany and Austria in 1857. The practice of forwarding parcels with the mail, however, had been in use in Austria since the seventeenth century and in some German states is said to date to the fifteenth century. In the first year after the establishment of the domestic parcel post in Germany (1874), 38,862,654 parcels were carried, rising to 62,946,100 by 1881.\n\nThe international parcel service, which allowed the orderly shipment of mailed packages and parcels from one country to another according to predetermined rates, was established by the Universal Postal Union on 1 October 1881 (Great Britain, India, The Netherlands and Persia, 1 April 1882), following the agreement of 1880 in Paris during a three-week conference on the subject. The service was difficult to introduce as in several countries the carriage of parcels was a monopoly of the railway companies, and Egypt, Great Britain, India, Canada and Italy all initially claimed that there was no parcel service in their country.\n\nThe British domestic parcel post service was established on 1 August 1883. Commonwealth and foreign parcel post services were also established. The eight Australasian colonies (South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, New Zealand, British New Guinea and Fiji) and the other separate postal services of the colonies joined the UPU in 1891. By 1909/10, over 118 million parcels annually were being carried in the U.K., around 2.5% of which were international.\n\nThe United States, as a signatory, started foreign parcel services in 1887 but did not institute domestic services until 1913.\n\nThe USPS, successor to the U.S. Post Office, officially ended International Parcel Post service in May 2007 after some 120 years of existence. International Parcel Post service was replaced by First-class Mail International service for parcels up to four pounds. For heavier parcels and/or printed matter, Priority Mail International, Priority Mail International Flat-Rate, Express Mail International, Airmail M-Bags, and Global Express Guaranteed service is available to foreign countries allowing these types of mail delivery.\n\nUSPS Domestic Parcel Post was an affordable method of sending large parcels of up to seventy pounds and a maximum combined length and girth of one hundred and thirty inches via ground transportation across the U.S. Effective January 27, 2013, the USPS renamed its parcel post service from 'Parcel Post' to 'Standard Post'. Effective January 17, 2016, the USPS renamed the service again, from \"Standard Post\" to \"USPS Retail Ground\", a name intended to resemble those of competing services UPS Ground and FedEx Ground.\n\nCommercial Parcel Post service is now under the \"Parcel Select\" name.\n\nPrivate couriers have existed since goods first needed to be transported from place to place. Before the development of state-run parcel posts, many railway companies had a thriving parcel service and private companies continue to run their own delivery networks today through firms like FedEx Express or DHL Express, even owning their own aircraft for long distance deliveries. Numerous smaller firms provide domestic and international courier services.\n\nBefore the development of the railway network, road transport was the principal means of parcel transport.

The concept is related to that of an ecological trap, in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat.\n\nIn a 2004 article discussing source-sink dynamics, James Battin did not distinguish between high-quality habitats that are preferred or avoided, labelling both \"sources.\" The latter scenario, in which a high-quality habitat is avoided, was first recognised as an important phenonmenon in 2007 by Gilroy and Sutherland, who described them as \"undervalued resources.\" The term \"perceptual trap\" was first proposed by Michael Patten and Jeffrey Kelly in a 2010 article. Hans Van Dyck argues that the term is misleading because perception is also a major component in other cases of trapping.\n\nAnimals use discrete environmental cues to select habitat. A perceptual trap occurs if change in an environmental cue leads an organism to avoid a high-quality habitat. It differs, therefore, from simple habitat avoidance, which may be a correct decision given the habitat's quality. The concept of a perceptual trap is related to that of an ecological trap, in which environmental change causes preference towards a low-quality habitat. There is expected to be strong natural selection against ecological traps, but not necessarily against perceptual traps, as Allee effects may restrict a population’s ability to establish itself.\n\nTo support the concept of a perceptual trap, Patten and Kelly cited a study of the lesser prairie chicken (\"Tympanuchus pallidicinctus\"). The species' natural environment, shinnery oak grassland, is often treated with the herbicide tebuthiuron to increase grass cover for cattle grazing. Herbicide treatment resulted in less shrub cover, a habitat cue that caused female lesser prairie-chickens to avoid the habitat in favour of untreated areas. However, females who nested in herbicide-treated areas achieved comparable nesting successes and clutch sizes to those in untreated areas. Patten and Kelly suggest that the adverse effects of tebuthiuron treatment on nesting success are countered by various effects, such as greater nest concealment through increased grass cover. Therefore, female birds are erroneously avoiding a high-quality habitat. Patten and Kelly also cited as a possible perceptual trap the cases of the spotted towhee (\"Pipilo maculatus\") and rufous-crowned sparrow (\"Aimophila ruficeps\"), which tend to avoid habitat fragments, even though birds nesting in habitat fragments achieve increased nesting success due to a reduction in snake predation.\n\n"}

It is one of the more simple classificatory systems of kinship (especially if compared to the complex English-language kinship system, e.g., cousin). One's genetic relationship or bloodline is often overridden by the desire to show proper respect that is due in the Philippine culture to age and the nature of the relationship, which are considered more important.\n\nIn it, the literal differences are distinguished by generation, age, and in some cases by gender. However, non-Filipinos can be confused by apparently similar relationships being handled verbally differently by the same person, which generally occurs because of the circumstantial relationship or because some authority is represented by the addressee. Other factors that affect how a person is addressed are whether the two are familiar with each other, new to each other's acquaintance, or perhaps involved in a secondary relationship that imparts authority, such as one person being the supervisor of another at work.\n\nAs an example, a teenage girl would call her older brother \"kuya\". She would also tend to call her older male cousin \"kuya\". That he is an older, blood-related male is more important than that a brother is not genetically related to the same degree that a cousin is. The term \"kuya\" is actually likely to be applied to any older male who is within her generation and should be treated with respect, perhaps even the very close friends of her brother. Thus, the terms used are often intended to show the degree of the relationship and the type of relationship, rather than literal biological relationship.\n\nThis can be seen in social settings like Facebook, where Filipino teenagers include contemporaries in the \"brothers\" and \"sisters\" categories (the equivalent of a \"best friend\" in U.S. culture).\n\nScholars generally disagree on the genetic origin of the \"original\" Filipino people, if there is any one dominant progenitor. For centuries there have been migrations from Asia, the Middle East, all the nearby island countries, and Europe (primarily the Spanish) who have all given something genetically and etymologically to the Philippines. Over 170 languages are recognized but do not have official status; Tagalog and English are the official languages of the Philippines, and basic English is more effective for communicating with far-flung peoples in the Philippines than any one dialect, including Tagalog. English's prominence is a reflection of the Philippines' close relationship with the United States, especially since World War II, and a testament to the broad reach of television, which broadcasts in a mix of Tagalog and English.\n\nTagalog is an Austronesian language that has borrowed heavily from the Philippines' geographical neighbors (Malayo-Polynesian languages, Chinese) as well as from Spanish, a legacy of Spain's prolonged colonization. For example, Tagalog has incorporated words like the greeting \"Kumusta\", from the Spanish \"Cómo está\". Familial greetings tend to be borrowed from Chinese.\n\nAs a child, one would refer to one's parents as \"Ama\" or \"Tatay\" (\"Father\", in formal and informal Filipino, respectively) and \"Ina\" or \"Nanay\" (Mother, in formal and informal Filipino, respectively). One's parents' siblings and their cousins would be called \"mga Tiyo\" (\"uncles\"), or \"Tiyo\" (\"uncle\") or \"mga Tiya\" (\"aunts\") or \"Tiya\" (\"aunt\"). One would call one's godparents \"Ninong\" and \"Ninang\",\nmeaning godfather and godmother, respectively.\n\nFamily friends one generation above, like parent's friends, are called \"Tito\" (for males) and \"Tita\" (for females), although they should not be confused with Tiyo and Tiya which are for blood relatives. Filipinos are very clannish and are known for recognizing relatives up to the 10th or even the 20th degree.\n\nA person's siblings (\"mga kapatid\") would be one's brothers or sisters. The terms \"Kuya\" and \"Ate\" are used to address an older brother and sister respectively as a sign of respect. Any children of their Tiyo (Uncle) or Tiya (Aunt) would be called \"mga pinsan\" (cousins) so one can either address them as \"pinsan\" or use the more commonly used \"Kuya [cousin's first name]\" or \"Ate [cousin's first name]\" if they are older, or simply address them with their first name or nickname. Their godparent's children are called kinakapatid, which literally means someone made into a sibling. The term \"Kuya\" is used in Filipino for older brother and \"Ate\" is used in Filipino for older sister, and those terms are what one also usually use to refer to or respect other people (including cousins and other strangers) who are in the same generation but a little older, or one could use the older term Manong (\"big brother\") and Manang (\"big sister\") for the much older people that one does not know up to two generations ahead, unless they are too old and then they should be called Lolo and Lola. \n\nThe children of one's \"mga kapatid\" (siblings) and \"mga pinsan\" (cousins) would be called \"mga pamangkin\" (nephews/nieces).\n\nIf a person is a \"Amang\" or \"Lolo\" (\"Grandfather\", in formal and informal Filipino, respectively) or \"Inang\" or \"Lola\" ( \"Grandmother\", in formal and imformal Filipino, respectively), those called \"mga apo\" (\"grandchildren\") would be the offsprings not only of their children (\"mga anak\") but also the offspring of their children's cousins (\"mga pinsan\"). Not unless a person have a different title (like \"Attorney\"/\"Atty.\", \"Dr.\", \"Mayor\", etc.) that one are known for, one may also be addressed as \"Lolo\" or \"Lola\" by complete strangers or neighbors just by virtue of their age (usually when they are above 60 years old or already considered a senior citizen), as a form of respect.\n\nThe following tree represents the Philippine kinship system, focusing on SECOND UNCLE and YOU.\n\n\"Kuya\" and \"Ate\" are also titles used to address older male and female cousins (regardless if they are the eldest or not, but older than cousin addressing them) as a sign of respect. It may also be used for people who aren't necessarily relatives but are older. The criteria would be gender (first), age (second), degree of affiliation (third), with actual blood or non-blood relationship being the least important.\n\n\"Tiyo\" and \"Tiya\", used literally for uncle and aunt, are often confused with \"Tito\" and \"Tita\" which are used in reference to your parents' close friends. Again, the degree of affiliation in the relationship overrides the literal meaning.\n\nThis hierarchy of conditions would be consistently applied to other familial terms that are used for relationship of further distance, such as \"Ninang\" and \"Ninong\", which are often applied to people who have no actual blood relationship but have earned a showing of respect which also defines their age, gender, and station in life.\n\nFilipinos would generally greet each other using their title like: \"Kumusta Ate Jhen\", or \"Kumusta Kuya Jay\"; because doing otherwise is considered rude and disrespectful.\n\n"}

Players are generally invited to show up beforehand, but unlike exhibition games there is no sense of obligation or commitment to play. Pick-up games usually lack officials and referees, which makes them more disorganized and less structured than regular games, but the total number of players in such games globally is likely to be greater than the number playing in formal competitions and leagues. \n\nWithout formal rules and regulations, pick-up games are often played with a less rigid set of rules.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "97169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97169", "title": "Port", "text": "Port\n\nA port is a maritime commercial facility which may comprise one or more wharves where ships may dock to load and discharge passengers and cargo. Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, some ports, such as Hamburg, Manchester and Duluth, are many miles inland, with access from the sea via river or canal.\n\nToday, by far the greatest growth in port development is in Asia, the continent with some of the world's largest and busiest ports, such as Singapore and the Chinese ports of Shanghai and Ningbo-Zhoushan.\n\nWhenever ancient civilisations engaged in maritime trade, they tended to develop sea ports. One of the world's oldest known artificial harbors is at Wadi al-Jarf on the Red Sea. Along with the finding of harbor structures, ancient anchors have also been found. \n\nOther ancient ports include Guangzhou during Qin Dynasty China and Canopus, the principal Egyptian port for Greek trade before the foundation of Alexandria. In ancient Greece, Athens' port of Piraeus was the base for the Athenian fleet which played a crucial role in the Battle of Salamis against the Persians in 480 BCE. In ancient India from 3700 BCE, Lothal was a prominent city of the Indus valley civilisation, located in the Bhāl region of the modern state of Gujarāt. Ostia Antica was the port of ancient Rome with Portus established by Claudius and enlarged by Trajan to supplement the nearby port of Ostia. In Japan, during the Edo period, the island of Dejima was the only port open for trade with Europe and received only a single Dutch ship per year, whereas Osaka was the largest domestic port and the main trade hub for rice.\n\nNowadays, many of these ancient sites no longer exist or function as modern ports. Even in more recent times, ports sometimes fall out of use. Rye, East Sussex, was an important English port in the Middle Ages, but the coastline changed and it is now from the sea, while the ports of Ravenspurn and Dunwich have been lost to coastal erosion.\n\nWhereas early ports tended to be just simple harbours, modern ports tend to be multimodal distribution hubs, with transport links using sea, river, canal, road, rail and air routes. Successful ports are located to optimize access to an active hinterland, such as the London Gateway. Ideally, a port will grant easy navigation to ships, and will give shelter from wind and waves. Ports are often on estuaries, where the water may be shallow and may need regular dredging. Deep water ports such as Milford Haven are less common, but can handle larger ships with a greater draft, such as super tankers, Post-Panamax vessels and large container ships. Other businesses such as regional distribution centres, warehouses and freight-forwarders, canneries and other processing facilities find it advantageous to be located within a port or nearby. Modern ports will have specialised cargo-handling equipment, such as gantry cranes, reach stackers and forklift trucks.\n\nPorts usually have specialised functions: some tend to cater mainly for passenger ferries and cruise ships; some specialise in container traffic or general cargo; and some ports play an important military role for their nation's navy. Some third world countries and small islands such as Ascension and St Helena still have limited port facilities, so that ships must anchor off while their cargo and passengers are taken ashore by barge or launch (respectively).\n\nIn modern times, ports survive or decline, depending on current economic trends. In the UK, both the ports of Liverpool and Southampton were once significant in the transatlantic passenger liner business. Once airliner traffic decimated that trade, both ports diversified to container cargo and cruise ships. Up until the 1950s the Port of London was a major international port on the River Thames, but changes in shipping and the use of containers and larger ships, have led to its decline. Thamesport, a small semi-automated container port (with links to the Port of Felixstowe, the UK's largest container port) thrived for some years, but has been hit hard by competition from the emergent London Gateway port and logistics hub.\n\nIn mainland Europe, it is normal for ports to be publicly owned, so that, for instance, the ports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam are owned partly by the state and partly by the cities themselves. By contrast, in the UK all ports are in private hands, such as Peel Ports who own the Port of Liverpool, John Lennon Airport and the Manchester Ship Canal. \n\nEven though modern ships tend to have bow-thrusters and stern-thrusters, many port authorities still require vessels to use pilots and tugboats for manoeuvering large ships in tight quarters. For instance, ships approaching the Belgian port of Antwerp, an inland port on the River Scheldt, are obliged to use Dutch pilots when navigating on that part of the estuary that belongs to the Netherlands.\n\nPorts with international traffic have customs facilities.\n\nThe terms \"port\" and \"seaport\" are used for different types of port facilities that handle ocean-going vessels, and river port is used for river traffic, such as barges and other shallow-draft vessels.\n\nA dry port is an inland intermodal terminal directly connected by road or rail to a seaport and operating as a centre for the transshipment of sea cargo to inland destinations.\n\nA fishing port is a port or harbor for landing and distributing fish. It may be a recreational facility, but it is usually commercial. A fishing port is the only port that depends on an ocean product, and depletion of fish may cause a fishing port to be uneconomical.\n\nAn inland port is a port on a navigable lake, river (fluvial port), or canal with access to a sea or ocean, which therefore allows a ship to sail from the ocean inland to the port to load or unload its cargo. An example of this is the St. Lawrence Seaway which allows ships to travel from the Atlantic Ocean several thousand kilometers inland to Great Lakes ports like Toronto, Duluth-Superior, and Chicago.\n\nA seaport is further categorized as a \"cruise port\" or a \"cargo port\". Additionally, \"cruise ports\" are also known as a \"home port\" or a \"port of call\". The \"cargo port\" is also further categorized into a \"bulk\" or \"break bulk port\" or as a \"container port\".\n\nCargo ports, on the other hand, are quite different from cruise ports, because each handles very different cargo, which has to be loaded and unloaded by very different mechanical means. The port may handle one particular type of cargo or it may handle numerous cargoes, such as grains, liquid fuels, liquid chemicals, wood, automobiles, etc. Such ports are known as the \"bulk\" or \"break bulk ports\". Those ports that handle containerized cargo are known as container ports. Most cargo ports handle all sorts of cargo, but some ports are very specific as to what cargo they handle. Additionally, the individual cargo ports are divided into different operating terminals which handle the different cargoes, and are operated by different companies, also known as terminal operators or stevedores.\n\nA cruise home port is the port where cruise ship passengers board (or embark) to start their cruise and disembark the cruise ship at the end of their cruise. It is also where the cruise ship's supplies are loaded for the cruise, which includes everything from fresh water and fuel to fruits, vegetables, champagne, and any other supplies needed for the cruise. \"Cruise home ports\" are very busy places during the day the cruise ship is in port, because off-going passengers debark their baggage and on-coming passengers board the ship in addition to all the supplies being loaded. Currently, the \"Cruise Capital of the World\" is the Port of Miami, Florida, closely followed behind by Port Everglades, Florida and the Port of San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nA port of call is an intermediate stop for a ship on its sailing itinerary. At these ports, cargo ships may take on supplies or fuel, as well as unloading and loading cargo while cruise liners have passengers get on or off ship.\n\nA warm-water port is one where the water does not freeze in wintertime. Because they are available year-round, warm-water ports can be of great geopolitical or economic interest. Such settlements as Dalian in China, Vostochny Port, Murmansk and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in Russia, Odessa in Ukraine, Kushiro in Japan and Valdez at the terminus of the Alaska Pipeline owe their very existence to being ice-free ports. The Baltic Sea and similar areas have ports available year-round beginning in the 20th century thanks to icebreakers, but earlier access problems prompted Russia to expand its territory to the Black Sea.\n\nThere are several initiatives to decrease negative environmental impacts of ports. These include SIMPYC, the World Ports Climate Initiative, the African Green Port Initiative and EcoPorts.\n\nThe busiest port in Africa is Port Said in Egypt.\n\nThe port of Shanghai is the largest port in the world in both cargo tonnage and activity. It regained its position as the world's busiest port by cargo tonnage and the world's busiest container port in 2009 and 2010, respectively. It is followed by the ports of Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which are in Asia.\n\nEurope's busiest container port and biggest port by cargo tonnage by far is the Port of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. It is followed by the Belgian Port of Antwerp or the German Port of Hamburg, depending on which metric is used. In turn, the Spanish Port of Valencia is the busiest port in the Mediterranean basin.\n\nThe largest ports include the ports of Los Angeles and South Louisiana in the U.S., Manzanillo in Mexico and Vancouver in Canada. Panama also has the Panama Canal that connects the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, and is a key conduit for international trade.\n\nThe largest port in Australia is the Port of Melbourne.\n\nAccording to ECLAC's \"Maritime and Logistics Profile of Latin America and the Caribbean\", the largest ports in South America are the Port of Santos in Brazil, Cartagena in Colombia, Callao in Peru, Guayaquil in Ecuador and the Port of Buenos Aires in Argentina.\n\n\n\n\n"}

But it is common practice to refer to the earlier, Greek-inspired body of Islamic texts as the \"Corpus Jabirianum\" or Jabirian Corpus, and to the later, 13th to 14th century Latin corpus as Pseudo-Geber or Latin Pseudo-Geber, a term introduced by Marcellin Berthelot. The \"Pseudo-Geber problem\" is the question of a possible relation between the two corpora. This question has long been controversially discussed. It is now mostly thought that at least parts of Latin Pseudo-Geber are based on earlier Islamic authors such as Al-Razi.\n\nThe following set of books is called the \"Pseudo-Geber Corpus\" (or the \"Latin Geber Corpus\"). \nThe works were first edited in the 16th century, but had been in circulation in manuscript form for roughly 200 years beforehand. \nThe stated author is \"Geber\" or \"Geber Arabs\" (Geber the Arab), and it is stated in some copies that the translator is \"Rodogerus Hispalensis\" (Roger of Hispania).\nThe works attributed to Geber include:\n\nBeing the clearest expression of alchemical theory and laboratory directions available until then—in a field where mysticism, secrecy, and obscurity were the usual rule—Pseudo-Geber's books were widely read and influential among European alchemists.\n\nThe \"Summa Perfectionis\" in particular was one of the most widely read alchemy books in western Europe in the late medieval period. \nIts author assumed that all metals are composed of unified sulfur and mercury corpuscles and gave detailed descriptions of metallic properties in those terms. \nThe use of an elixir for transmuting base metals into gold is explained (see philosopher's stone) and a lengthy defense is given defending alchemy against the charge that transmutation of metals was impossible.\n\nThe practical directions for laboratory procedures were so clear that it is obvious the author was familiar with many chemical operations. It contains early recipes for producing mineral acids, much like the earlier Arabic corpus. It was not equaled in chemistry until the 16th century writings of chemist Vannoccio Biringuccio, mineralogist Georgius Agricola and assayer Lazarus Ercker.\n\nThe next three books on the list above are shorter and are, to a substantial degree, condensations of the material in the \"Summa Perfectionis\".\n\nTwo further works, \"Testamentum Geberi\" and \"Alchemia Geberi\", are \"absolutely spurious, being of a later date [than the other four]\", as Marcellin Berthelot put it, and they are usually not included as part of the Pseudo-Geber corpus. \nTheir author is not the same as the others, but it is not certain that the first four have the same author either.\n\"De Inventione Veritatis\" has the earliest known recipe for the preparation of nitric acid.\n\nManuscripts:\n\nEarly editions:\n\nEarly translations:\n\nIslamic alchemy was held in high esteem by 13th century European alchemists, and the author adopted the name of an illustrious predecessor, as was usual practice at the time. \nThe authorship of Geber (Jabir ibn Hayyam) was first questioned in the late 19th century by the studies of Kopp, Hoefer, Berthelot, and Lippmann. The corpus is clearly influenced by medieval Islamic writers (especially by Al-Razi, and to a lesser extent, the eponymous Jabir). \nThe identity of the author remains uncertain. \nHe may have lived in Italy or Spain, or both. Some books in the Geber corpus may have been written by authors that post-date the author of the \"Summa Perfectionis\", as most of the other books in the corpus are largely recapitulations of the \"Summa Perfectionis\". \nWilliam R. Newman in his 1991 crtitical edition of the \"Summa perfectionis\" argues that the author of the \"Summa perfectionis\" was Paul of Taranto.\nCrosland (2004) refers to Geber as \"a Latin author\" while still emphasizing the identity of the author being \"still in dispute\".\nThe estimated date for the first four books is 1310, and they could not date from much before that because no reference to the \"Summa Perfectionis\" is found anywhere in the world before or during the 13th century. For example, there is no mention in the 13th century writings of Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon.\n\nThe degree of dependence of the corpus from actual Islamic sources is somewhat disputed.\nBrown (1920) asserted that the Pseudo-Geber Corpus contained \"new and original facts\" not known from Islamic alchemy, specifically mention of \nnitric acid, aqua regia, oil of vitriol and silver nitrate. Already in the 1920s, Eric John Holmyard criticized the claim of Pseudo-Geber being \"new and original\" compared to medieval Islamic alchemy, arguing for direct derivation from Islamic authors. \nHolmyard later argued that the then-recent discovery of Jabir's \"The Book of Seventy\" diminished the weight of the argument of there being \"no Arabic originals\" corresponding to Pseudo-Geber, \nBy 1957, Holmyard was willing to admit that \"the general style of the works is too clear and systematic to find a close parallel in any of the known writings of the Jabirian corpus\" and that they seemed to be \"the product of an occidental rather than an oriental mind\" while still asserting that the author must have been able to read Arabic and most likely worked in Moorish Spain.\n\nWith Brown (1920), Karpenko and Norris (2001) still assert that the first documented occurrence of aqua regia is in Pseudo-Geber. By contrast, Ahmad Y. Al-Hassan (2005) claimed that Islamic texts dated to before the 13th century, including the works of Jabir and Al-Razi, did in fact contain detailed descriptions of substances such as nitric acid, aqua regia, vitriol, and various nitrates,\nand Al-Hassan in 2009 argued that the Pseudo-Gerber Corpus was a direct translation of a work originally written in Arabic, pointing to a number of Arabic Jabirian manuscripts which already contain much of the theories and practices that Berthelot previously attributed to the Latin corpus.\n"}

The neighborhood lies at the western edge of Kathmandu Durbar Square. Tamrakar's ancestral home stands near a large stupa and is known as Tagwah Chibha meaning \"large stupa\". He attended high school in Kolkata, India and returned to Kathmandu and married Hira Devi.\n\nTamrakar was a Lhasa trader. In 1940, he went to Lhasa, Tibet and joined his maternal uncle's business house. Tamrakar engaged in business, and also served as secretary of the Nepalese Chamber of Commerce, Lhasa. While in Lhasa, he came into contact with another Nepalese merchant Pushpa Ratna Sagar, and was inspired to write and serve his mother tongue. His first article was published in \"Dharmodaya\" magazine in 1948. Tamrakar returned to Kathmandu in 1948. \n\nRestrictions on publication in Nepal Bhasa were removed after the Rana dynasty was overthrown and democracy established in 1951. The same year, Tamrakar, Sagar and another merchant Ratna Man Singh Tuladhar started a monthly magazine named \"Thaunkanhe\" (थौंकन्हे) with the money donated by Nepalese traders in Lhasa. The three partners were editor, deputy editor and publisher respectively. It was the first magazine in Nepal Bhasa to be published from Nepal. Tamrakar was editor of \"Thaunkanhe\" from 1951 to 1957.\n\nIn 1952, the three partners established their own printing press named Nepal Press in a bid to promote publishing in Nepal Bhasa. It was located at 11/122 Asan Tyouda Tol, Kathmandu. They also set up Thaunkanhe Publications Division which published a number of books. \n\nMeanwhile, Tamrakar acquired a BA degree (Sahitya Ratna) from Nepal Rastriya Vidyapeeth, Birgunj in 1953. He was among the first batch of four students.\n\nBesides writing, Tamrakar was involved in Buddhist activities, and was elected assistant secretary of Dharmodaya Sabha in 1956 when it held the landmark fourth international conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists in Kathmandu. Dharmodaya Sabha is a Buddhist organization formed in 1944 in Sarnath, India by Buddhist monks expelled from Nepal.\n\nIn 1960, Tamrakar and Sagar sold their shares in Nepal Press to Tuladhar, and it was shifted to New Road. Tamrakar continued writing and published six books on culture, literature, historical sites and his experiences in Tibet. He also served as editor of \"Nepal Ritu Pau\", a literary quarterly. From 2000 to 2005, he was president of Nepal Bhasa Parisad (Nepal Bhasa Council). \n\nIn 2004, the Nepal Bhasha Academy awarded Tamrakar the Danyahira Sirpa Award for literature for his outstanding service and contribution in the field of Nepal Bhasha and culture. Nepal Bhasa Parisad declared him a Bhasa Thuwa (\"patron of the language\") in 2009.\n"}
{"id": "15368428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15368428", "title": "Radio", "text": "Radio\n\nRadio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.\n\nRadio systems need a transmitter to modulate (change) some property of the energy produced to impress a signal on it, for example using amplitude modulation or angle modulation (which can be frequency modulation or phase modulation). Radio systems also need an antenna to convert electric currents into radio waves, and radio waves into an electric current. An antenna can be used for both transmitting and receiving. The electrical resonance of tuned circuits in radios allow individual frequencies to be selected. The electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving antenna. A radio receiver receives its input from an antenna and converts it into a form that is usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital data, measurement values, navigational positions, etc. Radio frequencies occupy the range from a 3 kHz to 300 GHz, although commercially important uses of radio use only a small part of this spectrum.\n\nA radio communication system requires a transmitter and a receiver, each having an antenna and appropriate terminal equipment such as a microphone at the transmitter and a loudspeaker at the receiver in the case of a voice-communication system.\n\nThe term \"radio\" is derived from the Latin word \"radius\", meaning \"spoke of a wheel, beam of light, ray\". It was first applied to communications in 1881 when, at the suggestion of French scientist , Alexander Graham Bell adopted \"radiophone\" (meaning \"radiated sound\") as an alternate name for his photophone optical transmission system. However, this invention would not be widely adopted.\n\nFollowing Heinrich Hertz's establishment of the existence of electromagnetic radiation in the late 1880s, a variety of terms were initially used for the phenomenon, with early descriptions of the radiation itself including \"Hertzian waves\", \"electric waves\", and \"ether waves\", while phrases describing its use in communications included \"spark telegraphy\", \"space telegraphy\", \"aerography\" and, eventually and most commonly, \"wireless telegraphy\". However, \"wireless\" included a broad variety of related electronic technologies, including electrostatic induction, electromagnetic induction and aquatic and earth conduction, so there was a need for a more precise term referring exclusively to electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe first use of \"radio-\" in conjunction with electromagnetic radiation appears to have been by French physicist Édouard Branly, who in 1890 developed a version of a coherer receiver he called a \"\". The radio- prefix was later used to form additional descriptive compound and hyphenated words, especially in Europe. For example, in early 1898 the British publication \"The Practical Engineer\" included a reference to \"the radiotelegraph\" and \"radiotelegraphy\", while the French text of both the 1903 and 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Conventions includes the phrases \"radiotélégraphique\" and \"radiotélégrammes\".\n\nThe use of \"radio\" as a standalone word dates back to at least December 30, 1904, when instructions issued by the British Post Office for transmitting telegrams specified that \"The word 'Radio'... is sent in the Service Instructions\". This practice was universally adopted, and the word \"radio\" introduced internationally, by the 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Convention, which included a Service Regulation specifying that \"Radiotelegrams shall show in the preamble that the service is 'Radio'\".\n\nThe switch to \"radio\" in place of \"wireless\" took place slowly and unevenly in the English-speaking world. Lee de Forest helped popularize the new word in the United States—in early 1907 he founded the DeForest Radio Telephone Company, and his letter in the June 22, 1907 \"Electrical World\" about the need for legal restrictions warned that \"Radio chaos will certainly be the result until such stringent regulation is enforced\". The United States Navy would also play a role. Although its translation of the 1906 Berlin Convention used the terms \"wireless telegraph\" and \"wireless telegram\", by 1912 it began to promote the use of \"radio\" instead. The term started to become preferred by the general public in the 1920s with the introduction of broadcasting. (\"Broadcasting\" is based upon an agricultural term meaning roughly \"scattering seeds widely\".) British Commonwealth countries continued to commonly use the term \"wireless\" until the mid-20th century, though the magazine of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the UK has been called \"Radio Times\" since its founding in the early 1920s.\n\nIn recent years the more general term \"wireless\" has gained renewed popularity, even for devices using electromagnetic radiation, through the rapid growth of short-range computer networking, e.g., Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, as well as mobile telephony, e.g., GSM and UMTS cell phones. Today, the term \"radio\" specifies the transceiver device or chip, whereas \"wireless\" refers to the lack of physical connections; thus equipment employs embedded \"radio\" transceivers, but operates as \"wireless\" devices over \"wireless\" sensor networks.\n\nRadio systems used for communication have the following elements. With more than 100 years of development, each process is implemented by a wide range of methods, specialised for different communications purposes.\n\nEach system contains a transmitter. This consists of a source of electrical energy, producing alternating current of a desired frequency of oscillation. The transmitter contains a system to modulate (change) some property of the energy produced to impress a signal on it. This modulation might be as simple as turning the energy on and off, or altering more subtle properties such as amplitude, frequency, phase, or combinations of these properties. The transmitter sends the modulated electrical energy to a tuned resonant antenna; this structure converts the rapidly changing alternating current into an electromagnetic wave that can move through free space (sometimes with a particular polarization).\n\nAmplitude modulation of a carrier wave works by varying the strength of the transmitted signal in proportion to the information being sent. For example, changes in the signal strength can be used to reflect the sounds to be reproduced by a speaker, or to specify the light intensity of television pixels. It was the method used for the first audio radio transmissions, and remains in use today. \"AM\" is often used to refer to the medium wave broadcast band (see AM radio), but it is used in various radiotelephone services such as the Citizens Band, amateur radio and especially in aviation, due to its ability to be received under very weak signal conditions and its immunity to capture effect, allowing more than one signal to be heard simultaneously.\n\nFrequency modulation varies the frequency of the carrier. The instantaneous frequency of the carrier is directly proportional to the instantaneous value of the input signal. FM has the \"capture effect\" whereby a receiver only receives the strongest signal, even when others are present. Digital data can be sent by shifting the carrier's frequency among a set of discrete values, a technique known as frequency-shift keying. FM is commonly used at Very high frequency (VHF) radio frequencies for high-fidelity broadcasts of music and speech (see FM broadcasting). Analog TV sound is also broadcast using FM.\n\nAngle modulation alters the instantaneous phase of the carrier wave to transmit a signal. It may be either FM or phase modulation (PM).\n\nAn \"antenna\" (or \"aerial\") is an electrical device which converts electric currents into radio waves, and vice versa. It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. high frequency AC) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified. Some antennas can be used for both transmitting and receiving, even simultaneously, depending on the connected equipment.\n\nOnce generated, electromagnetic waves travel through space either directly, or have their path altered by reflection, refraction or diffraction. The intensity of the waves diminishes due to geometric dispersion (the inverse-square law); some energy may also be absorbed by the intervening medium in some cases. Noise will generally alter the desired signal; this electromagnetic interference comes from natural sources, as well as from artificial sources such as other transmitters and accidental radiators. Noise is also produced at every step due to the inherent properties of the devices used. If the magnitude of the noise is large enough, the desired signal will no longer be discernible; the signal-to-noise ratio is the fundamental limit to the range of radio communications.\n\nElectrical resonance of tuned circuits in radios allow individual stations to be selected. A resonant circuit will respond strongly to a particular frequency, and much less so to differing frequencies. This allows the radio receiver to discriminate between multiple signals differing in frequency.\n\nThe electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving antenna; this structure captures some of the energy of the wave and returns it to the form of oscillating electrical currents. At the receiver, these currents are demodulated, which is conversion to a usable signal form by a detector sub-system. The receiver is \"tuned\" to respond preferentially to the desired signals, and reject undesired signals.\n\nEarly radio systems relied entirely on the energy collected by an antenna to produce signals for the operator. Radio became more useful after the invention of electronic devices such as the vacuum tube and later the transistor, which made it possible to amplify weak signals. Today radio systems are used for applications from walkie-talkie children's toys to the control of space vehicles, as well as for broadcasting, and many other applications.\n\nA \"radio receiver\" receives its input from an antenna, uses electronic filters to separate a wanted radio signal from all other signals picked up by this antenna, amplifies it to a level suitable for further processing, and finally converts through demodulation and decoding the signal into a form usable for the consumer, such as sound, pictures, digital data, measurement values, navigational positions, etc.\n\nRadio frequencies occupy the range from a 3 kHz to 300 GHz, although commercially important uses of radio use only a small part of this spectrum. Other types of electromagnetic radiation, with frequencies above the RF range, are infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. Since the energy of an individual photon of radio frequency is too low to remove an electron from an atom, radio waves are classified as non-ionizing radiation.\n\nA \"radio communication system\" sends signals by radio. Types of radio communication systems deployed depend on technology, standards, regulations, radio spectrum allocation, user requirements, service positioning, and investment.\n\nThe radio equipment involved in communication systems includes a transmitter and a receiver, each having an antenna and appropriate terminal equipment such as a microphone at the transmitter and a loudspeaker at the receiver in the case of a voice-communication system. The power consumed in a transmitting station varies depending on the distance of communication and the transmission conditions. The power received at the receiving station is usually only a tiny fraction of the transmitter's output, since communication depends on receiving the information, not the energy, that was transmitted.\n\nClassical radio communications systems use frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) as a strategy to split up and share the available radio-frequency bandwidth for use by different parties' communications concurrently. Modern radio communication systems include those that divide up a radio-frequency band by time-division multiplexing (TDM) and code-division multiplexing (CDM) as alternatives to the classical FDM strategy. These systems offer different tradeoffs in supporting multiple users, beyond the FDM strategy that was ideal for broadcast radio but less so for applications such as mobile telephony.\n\nA radio communication system may send information only one way. For example, in broadcasting a single transmitter sends signals to many receivers. Two stations may take turns sending and receiving, using a single radio frequency; this is called \"simplex.\" By using two radio frequencies, two stations may continuously and concurrently send and receive signals - this is called \"duplex\" operation.\n\nIn 1864 James Clerk Maxwell showed mathematically that electromagnetic waves could propagate through free space. The effects of electromagnetic waves (then-unexplained \"action at a distance\" sparking behavior) were actually observed before and after Maxwell's work by many inventors and experimenters including George Adams (1780-1784), Luigi Galvani (1791), Peter Samuel Munk (1835), Joseph Henry (1842), Samuel Alfred Varley (1852), Edwin Houston, Elihu Thomson, Thomas Edison (1875) and David Edward Hughes (1878). Edison gave the effect the name \"etheric force\" and Hughes detected a spark impulse up to 500 yards (460 m) with a portable receiver, but none could identify what caused the phenomenon and it was usually written off as electromagnetic induction. In 1886 Heinrich Rudolf Hertz noticed the same sparking phenomenon and, in published experiments (1887-1888), was able to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves in an experiment confirming Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism.\n\nThe discovery of these \"Hertzian waves\" (radio waves) prompted many experiments by physicists. An August 1894 lecture by the British physicist Oliver Lodge, where he transmitted and received \"Hertzian waves\" at distances up to 50 meters, was followed up the same year with experiments by Bengali physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose in extremely high frequency radio microwave optics and a year later with the construction of a radio based lightning detector by Russian physicist Alexander Stepanovich Popov. Starting in late 1894, Guglielmo Marconi began pursuing the idea of building a wireless telegraphy system based on Hertzian waves (radio). Marconi gained a patent on the system in 1896 and developed it into a commercial communication system over the next few years.\n\nEarly 20th century radio systems transmitted messages by continuous wave code only. Early attempts at developing a system of amplitude modulation for voice and music were demonstrated in 1900 and 1906, but had little success. World War I accelerated the development of radio for military communications, and in this era the first vacuum tubes were applied to radio transmitters and receivers. Electronic amplification was a key development in changing radio from an experimental practice by experts into a home appliance. After the war, commercial radio broadcasting began in the 1920s and became an important mass medium for entertainment and news. David Sarnoff, an early exponent of broadcast radio, persuaded the Radio Corporation of America to begin an AM broadcasting service which rapidly grew in popularity. World War II again accelerated development of radio for the wartime purposes of aircraft and land communication, radio navigation and radar. After the war, the experiments in television that had been interrupted were resumed, and it also became an important home entertainment broadcast medium. Stereo FM broadcasting of radio was taking place from the 1930s onwards in the United States and displaced AM as the dominant commercial standard by the 1960s, and by the 1970s in the United Kingdom.\n\nEarly uses were maritime, for sending telegraphic messages using Morse code between ships and land. The earliest users included the Japanese Navy scouting the Russian fleet during the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. One of the most memorable uses of marine telegraphy was during the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\" in 1912, including communications between operators on the sinking ship and nearby vessels, and communications to shore stations listing the survivors.\n\nRadio was used to pass on orders and communications between armies and navies on both sides in World War I; Germany used radio communications for diplomatic messages once it discovered that its submarine cables had been tapped by the British. The United States passed on President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points to Germany via radio during the war. Broadcasting began from San Jose, California in 1909, and became feasible in the 1920s, with the widespread introduction of radio receivers, particularly in Europe and the United States. Besides broadcasting, point-to-point broadcasting, including telephone messages and relays of radio programs, became widespread in the 1920s and 1930s. Another important application of radio, in the years just before and during World War II, was its development and active use for detecting and locating aircraft and ships by the use of radar (\"RA\"dio \"D\"etection \"A\"nd \"R\"anging).\n\nToday, radio takes many forms, including wireless networks and mobile communications of all types, as well as radio broadcasting. Before the advent of television, commercial radio broadcasts included not only news and music, but dramas, comedies, variety shows, and many other forms of entertainment (the era from the late 1920s to the mid-1950s is commonly called radio's \"Golden Age\"). Radio was unique among methods of dramatic presentation in that it used only sound. For more, see radio programming.\n\nAM radio uses amplitude modulation, in which the amplitude of the transmitted signal is made proportional to the sound amplitude captured (transduced) by the microphone, while the transmitted frequency remains unchanged. Transmissions are affected by static and interference because lightning and other sources of radio emissions on the same frequency add their amplitudes to the original transmitted amplitude.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, American AM radio stations broadcast with powers as high as 500 kW, and some could be heard worldwide; these stations' transmitters were commandeered for military use by the US Government during World War II. Currently, the maximum broadcast power for a civilian AM radio station in the United States and Canada is 50 kW, and the majority of stations that emit signals this powerful were grandfathered in (see List of 50 kW AM radio stations in the United States). In 1986 KTNN received the last granted 50,000-watt class A license. These 50 kW stations are generally called \"clear channel\" stations (not to be confused with Clear Channel Communications), because within North America each of these stations has exclusive use of its broadcast frequency throughout part or all of the broadcast day.\n\nFM broadcast radio sends music and voice with less noise than AM radio. It is often mistakenly thought that FM is higher fidelity than AM, but that is not true. AM is capable of the same audio bandwidth that FM employs. AM receivers typically use narrower filters in the receiver to recover the signal with less noise. AM stereo receivers can reproduce the same audio bandwidth that FM does due to the wider filter used in an AM stereo receiver, but today, AM radios limit the audio bandpass to 3–5 kHz. In frequency modulation, amplitude variation at the microphone causes the transmitter frequency to fluctuate. Because the audio signal modulates the frequency and not the amplitude, an FM signal is not subject to static and interference in the same way as AM signals. Due to its need for a wider bandwidth, FM is transmitted in the Very High Frequency (VHF, 30 MHz to 300 MHz) radio spectrum. \n\nVHF radio waves act more like light, traveling in straight lines; hence the reception range is generally limited to about . During unusual upper atmospheric conditions, FM signals are occasionally reflected back towards the Earth by the ionosphere, resulting in long distance FM reception. FM receivers are subject to the capture effect, which causes the radio to only receive the strongest signal when multiple signals appear on the same frequency. FM receivers are relatively immune to lightning and spark interference.\n\nHigh power is useful in penetrating buildings, diffracting around hills, and refracting in the dense atmosphere near the horizon for some distance beyond the horizon. Consequently, 100,000-watt FM stations can regularly be heard up to away, and farther, , if there are no competing signals. A few old, \"grandfathered\" stations do not conform to these power rules. WBCT-FM (93.7) in Grand Rapids, Michigan, US, runs 320,000 watts ERP, and can increase to 500,000 watts ERP by the terms of its original license. Such a huge power level does not usually help to increase range as much as one might expect, because VHF frequencies travel in nearly straight lines over the horizon and off into space.\n\nFM subcarrier services are secondary signals transmitted in a \"piggyback\" fashion along with the main program. Special receivers are required to utilize these services. Analog channels may contain alternative programming, such as reading services for the blind, background music or stereo sound signals. In some extremely crowded metropolitan areas, the sub-channel program might be an alternate foreign-language radio program for various ethnic groups. Sub-carriers can also transmit digital data, such as station identification, the current song's name, web addresses, or stock quotes. In some countries, FM radios automatically re-tune themselves to the same channel in a different district by using sub-bands.\n\nAviation voice radios use Aircraft band VHF AM. AM is used so that multiple stations on the same channel can be received. (Use of FM would result in stronger stations blocking out reception of weaker stations due to FM's capture effect). Aircraft fly high enough that their transmitters can be received hundreds of miles away, even though they are using VHF.\nMarine voice radios can use single sideband voice (SSB) in the shortwave High Frequency (HF—3 MHz to 30 MHz) radio spectrum for very long ranges or Marine VHF radio / \"narrowband FM\" in the VHF spectrum for much shorter ranges. Narrowband FM sacrifices fidelity to make more channels available within the radio spectrum, by using a smaller range of radio frequencies, usually with five kHz of deviation, versus the 75 kHz used by commercial FM broadcasts, and 25 kHz used for TV sound.\n\nGovernment, police, fire and commercial voice services also use narrowband FM on special frequencies. Early police radios used AM receivers to receive one-way dispatches. Civil and military HF (high frequency) voice services use shortwave radio to contact ships at sea, aircraft and isolated settlements. Most use single sideband voice (SSB), which uses less bandwidth than AM. On an AM radio SSB sounds like ducks quacking, or the adults in a Charlie Brown cartoon. Viewed as a graph of frequency versus power, an AM signal shows power where the frequencies of the voice add and subtract with the main radio frequency. SSB cuts the bandwidth in half by suppressing the carrier and one of the sidebands. This also makes the transmitter about three times more powerful, because it doesn't need to transmit the unused carrier and sideband.\n\nTETRA, Terrestrial Trunked Radio is a digital cell phone system for military, police and ambulances. Commercial services such as XM, WorldSpace and Sirius offer encrypted digital satellite radio.\n\nMobile phones transmit to a local cell site (transmitter/receiver) that ultimately connects to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) through an optic fiber or microwave radio and other network elements. When the mobile phone nears the edge of the cell site's radio coverage area, the central computer switches the phone to a new cell. Cell phones originally used FM, but now most use either GSM or CDMA digital modulation schemes. Satellite phones use satellites rather than cell towers to communicate.\n\nAnalog television sends the picture as AM and the sound as AM or FM, with the sound carrier a fixed frequency (4.5 MHz in the NTSC system) away from the video carrier. Analog television also uses a vestigial sideband on the video carrier to reduce the bandwidth required.\n\nDigital television uses 8VSB modulation in North America (under the ATSC digital television standard), and COFDM modulation elsewhere in the world (using the DVB-T standard). A Reed–Solomon error correction code adds redundant correction codes and allows reliable reception during moderate data loss. Although many current and future codecs can be sent in the MPEG transport stream container format, as of 2006 most systems use a standard-definition format almost identical to DVD: MPEG-2 video in Anamorphic widescreen and MPEG layer 2 (\"MP2\") audio. High-definition television is possible simply by using a higher-resolution picture, but H.264/AVC is being considered as a replacement video codec in some regions for its improved compression. With the compression and improved modulation involved, a single \"channel\" can contain a high-definition program and several standard-definition programs.\n\nAll satellite navigation systems use satellites with precision clocks. The satellite transmits its position, and the time of the transmission. The receiver listens to four satellites, and can figure its position as being on a line that is tangent to a spherical shell around each satellite, determined by the time-of-flight of the radio signals from the satellite. A computer in the receiver does the math.\n\nRadio direction-finding is the oldest form of radio navigation. Before 1960 navigators used movable loop antennas to locate commercial AM stations near cities. In some cases they used marine radiolocation beacons, which share a range of frequencies just above AM radio with amateur radio operators. LORAN systems also used time-of-flight radio signals, but from radio stations on the ground.\n\nVery High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR), systems (used by aircraft), have an antenna array that transmits two signals simultaneously. A directional signal rotates like a lighthouse at a fixed rate. When the directional signal is facing north, an omnidirectional signal pulses. By measuring the difference in phase of these two signals, an aircraft can determine its bearing or radial from the station, thus establishing a line of position. An aircraft can get readings from two VORs and locate its position at the intersection of the two radials, known as a \"fix.\"\n\nWhen the VOR station is collocated with DME (Distance Measuring Equipment), the aircraft can determine its bearing and range from the station, thus providing a fix from only one ground station. Such stations are called VOR/DMEs. The military operates a similar system of navaids, called TACANs, which are often built into VOR stations. Such stations are called VORTACs. Because TACANs include distance measuring equipment, VOR/DME and VORTAC stations are identical in navigation potential to civil aircraft.\n\nRadar (Radio Detection And Ranging) detects objects at a distance by bouncing radio waves off them. The delay caused by the echo measures the distance. The direction of the beam determines the direction of the reflection. The polarization and frequency of the return can sense the type of surface. Navigational radars scan a wide area two to four times per minute. They use very short waves that reflect from earth and stone. They are common on commercial ships and long-distance commercial aircraft.\n\nGeneral purpose radars generally use navigational radar frequencies, but modulate and polarize the pulse so the receiver can determine the type of surface of the reflector. The best general-purpose radars distinguish the rain of heavy storms, as well as land and vehicles. Some can superimpose sonar data and map data from GPS position.\n\nSearch radars scan a wide area with pulses of short radio waves. They usually scan the area two to four times a minute. Sometimes search radars use the Doppler effect to separate moving vehicles from clutter. Targeting radars use the same principle as search radar but scan a much smaller area far more often, usually several times a second or more. Weather radars resemble search radars, but use radio waves with circular polarization and a wavelength to reflect from water droplets. Some weather radar use the Doppler effect to measure wind speeds.\n\nMost new radio systems are digital, including Digital TV, satellite radio, and Digital Audio Broadcasting. The oldest form of digital broadcast was spark gap telegraphy, used by pioneers such Popov or Marconi. By pressing the key, the operator could send messages in Morse code by energizing a rotating commutating spark gap. The rotating commutator produced a tone in the receiver, where a simple spark gap would produce a hiss, indistinguishable from static. Spark-gap transmitters are now illegal, because their transmissions span several hundred megahertz. This is very wasteful of both radio frequencies and power.\n\nThe next advance was continuous wave telegraphy, or CW (Continuous Wave), in which a pure radio frequency, produced by a vacuum tube electronic oscillator was switched on and off by a key. A receiver with a local oscillator would \"heterodyne\" with the pure radio frequency, creating a whistle-like audio tone. CW uses less than 100 Hz of bandwidth. CW is still used, these days primarily by amateur radio operators (hams). Strictly, on-off keying of a carrier should be known as \"Interrupted Continuous Wave\" or ICW or on-off keying (OOK).\n\nRadioteletype equipment usually operates on short-wave (HF) and is much loved by the military because they create written information without a skilled operator. They send a bit as one of two tones using frequency-shift keying. Groups of five or seven bits become a character printed by a teleprinter. From about 1925 to 1975, radioteletype was how most commercial messages were sent to less developed countries. These are still used by the military and weather services.\n\nAircraft use a 1200 Baud radioteletype service over VHF to send their ID, altitude and position, and get gate and connecting-flight data. Microwave dishes on satellites, telephone exchanges and TV stations usually use quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). QAM sends data by changing both the phase and the amplitude of the radio signal. Engineers like QAM because it packs the most bits into a radio signal when given an exclusive (non-shared) fixed narrowband frequency range. Usually the bits are sent in \"frames\" that repeat. A special bit pattern is used to locate the beginning of a frame.\n\nCommunication systems that limit themselves to a fixed narrowband frequency range are vulnerable to jamming. A variety of jamming-resistant spread spectrum techniques were initially developed for military use, most famously for Global Positioning System satellite transmissions. Commercial use of spread spectrum began in the 1980s. Bluetooth, most cell phones, and the 802.11b version of Wi-Fi each use various forms of spread spectrum.\n\nSystems that need reliability, or that share their frequency with other services, may use \"coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing\" or COFDM. COFDM breaks a digital signal into as many as several hundred slower subchannels. The digital signal is often sent as QAM on the subchannels. Modern COFDM systems use a small computer to make and decode the signal with digital signal processing, which is more flexible and far less expensive than older systems that implemented separate electronic channels.\n\nCOFDM resists fading and ghosting because the narrow-channel QAM signals can be sent slowly. An adaptive system, or one that sends error-correction codes can also resist interference, because most interference can affect only a few of the QAM channels. COFDM is used for Wi-Fi, some cell phones, Digital Radio Mondiale, Eureka 147, and many other local area network, digital TV and radio standards.\n\nRadio-frequency energy generated for heating of objects is generally not intended to radiate outside of the generating equipment, to prevent interference with other radio signals. Microwave ovens use intense radio waves to heat food. Diathermy equipment is used in surgery for sealing of blood vessels.\n\nAmateur radio, also known as \"ham radio\", is a hobby in which enthusiasts are licensed to communicate on a number of bands in the radio frequency spectrum non-commercially and for their own experiments. They may also provide emergency and service assistance in exceptional circumstances. This contribution has been very beneficial in saving lives in many instances.\n\nRadio amateurs use a variety of modes, including efficient ones like Morse code and experimental ones like Low-Frequency Experimental Radio. Several forms of radio were pioneered by radio amateurs and later became commercially important, including FM, single-sideband (SSB), AM, digital packet radio and satellite repeaters. Some amateur frequencies may be disrupted illegally by power-line internet service.\n\nUnlicensed, government-authorized personal radio services such as Citizens' band radio in Australia, most of the Americas, and Europe, and Family Radio Service and Multi-Use Radio Service in North America exist to provide simple, usually short range communication for individuals and small groups, without the overhead of licensing. Similar services exist in other parts of the world. These radio services involve the use of handheld units.\n\nWi-Fi also operates in unlicensed radio bands and is very widely used to network computers.\n\nFree radio stations, sometimes called pirate radio or \"clandestine\" stations, are unauthorized, unlicensed, illegal broadcasting stations. These are often low power transmitters operated on sporadic schedules by hobbyists, community activists, or political and cultural dissidents. Some pirate stations operating offshore in parts of Europe and the United Kingdom more closely resembled legal stations, maintaining regular schedules, using high power, and selling commercial advertising time.\n\nRadio remote controls use radio waves to transmit control data to a remote object as in some early forms of guided missile, some early TV remotes and a range of model boats, cars and airplanes. Large industrial remote-controlled equipment such as cranes and switching locomotives now usually use digital radio techniques to ensure safety and reliability.\n\nIn Madison Square Garden, at the Electrical Exhibition of 1898, Nikola Tesla successfully demonstrated a radio-controlled boat. He was awarded U.S. patent No. 613,809 for a \"Method of and Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vessels or Vehicles.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "98791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98791", "title": "SHRDLU", "text": "SHRDLU\n\nSHRDLU was an early natural language understanding computer program, developed by Terry Winograd at MIT in 1968–1970. In it, the user carries on a conversation with the computer, moving objects, naming collections and querying the state of a simplified \"blocks world\", essentially a virtual box filled with different blocks.\n\nSHRDLU was written in the Micro Planner and Lisp programming language on the DEC PDP-6 computer and a DEC graphics terminal. Later additions were made at the computer graphics labs at the University of Utah, adding a full 3D rendering of SHRDLU's \"world\".\n\nThe name SHRDLU was derived from ETAOIN SHRDLU, the arrangement of the letter keys on a Linotype machine, arranged in descending order of usage frequency in English.\n\nSHRDLU was primarily a language parser that allowed user interaction using English terms. The user instructed SHRDLU to move various objects around in the \"blocks world\" containing various basic objects: blocks, cones, balls, etc. What made SHRDLU unique was the combination of four simple ideas that added up to make the simulation of \"understanding\" far more convincing.\n\nOne was that SHRDLU's world was so simple that the entire set of objects and locations could be described by including as few as perhaps 50 words: nouns like \"block\" and \"cone\", verbs like \"place on\" and \"move to\", and adjectives like \"big\" and \"blue\". The possible combinations of these basic language building blocks were quite simple, and the program was fairly adept at figuring out what the user meant.\n\nSHRDLU also included a basic memory to supply context. One could ask SHRDLU to \"put the green cone on the red block\" and then \"take the cone off\"; \"the cone\" would be taken to mean the green cone one had just talked about. SHRDLU could search back further through the interactions to find the proper context in most cases when additional adjectives were supplied. One could also ask questions about the history, for instance one could ask \"did you pick up anything before the cone?\"\n\nA side effect of this memory, and the original rules SHRDLU was supplied with, is that the program could answer questions about what was possible in the world and what was not. For instance, SHRDLU would deduce that blocks could be stacked by looking for examples, but would realize that triangles couldn't be stacked, after having tried it. The \"world\" contained basic physics to make blocks fall over, independent of the language parser.\n\nFinally, SHRDLU could also remember names given to objects, or arrangements of them. For instance one could say \"a steeple is a small triangle on top of a tall rectangle\"; SHRDLU could then answer questions about steeples in the blocks world, and build new ones.\n\nHere is a famous demonstration of SHRDLU:\n\nSHRDLU was considered a tremendously successful demonstration of AI. This led other AI researchers to excessive optimism which was soon lost when later systems attempted to deal with situations with a more realistic level of ambiguity and complexity. Subsequent efforts of the SHRDLU type, such as Cyc, have tended to focus on providing the program with considerably more information from which it can draw conclusions.\n\nThough not intentionally developed as such, SHRDLU is considered the first known formal example of interactive fiction, as the user interacts with simple commands to move objects around a virtual environment, though lacking the distinct story-telling normally present in interactive fiction. The 1976-1977 game \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" is broadly considered to be the first true work of interactive fiction.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "318439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318439", "title": "Text mining", "text": "Text mining\n\nText mining, also referred to as text data mining, roughly equivalent to text analytics, is the process of deriving high-quality information from text. High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as statistical pattern learning. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a database), deriving patterns within the structured data, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance, novelty, and interest. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (\"i.e.\", learning relations between named entities).\n\nText analysis involves information retrieval, lexical analysis to study word frequency distributions, pattern recognition, tagging/annotation, information extraction, data mining techniques including link and association analysis, visualization, and predictive analytics. The overarching goal is, essentially, to turn text into data for analysis, via application of natural language processing (NLP) and analytical methods.\n\nA typical application is to scan a set of documents written in a natural language and either model the document set for predictive classification purposes or populate a database or search index with the information extracted.\n\nThe term text analytics describes a set of linguistic, statistical, and machine learning techniques that model and structure the information content of textual sources for business intelligence, exploratory data analysis, research, or investigation. The term is roughly synonymous with text mining; indeed, Ronen Feldman modified a 2000 description of \"text mining\" in 2004 to describe \"text analytics\". The latter term is now used more frequently in business settings while \"text mining\" is used in some of the earliest application areas, dating to the 1980s, notably life-sciences research and government intelligence.\n\nThe term text analytics also describes that application of text analytics to respond to business problems, whether independently or in conjunction with query and analysis of fielded, numerical data. It is a truism that 80 percent of business-relevant information originates in unstructured form, primarily text. These techniques and processes discover and present knowledge – facts, business rules, and relationships – that is otherwise locked in textual form, impenetrable to automated processing.\n\nSubtasks—components of a larger text-analytics effort—typically include:\n\n\nText mining technology is now broadly applied to a wide variety of government, research, and business needs. All three groups may use text mining for records management and searching documents relevant to their daily activities. Legal professionals may use text mining for e-discovery. Governments and military groups use text mining for national security and intelligence purposes. Scientific researchers incorporate text mining approaches into efforts to organize large sets of text data (i.e., addressing the problem of unstructured data), to determine ideas communicated through text (e.g., sentiment analysis in social media) and to support scientific discovery in fields such as the life sciences and bioinformatics. In business, applications are used to support competitive intelligence and automated ad placement, among numerous other activities.\n\nMany text mining software packages are marketed for security applications, especially monitoring and analysis of online plain text sources such as Internet news, blogs, etc. for national security purposes. It is also involved in the study of text encryption/decryption.\n\nA range of text mining applications in the biomedical literature has been described, including computational approaches to assist with studies in protein docking, protein interactions, and protein-disease associations. In addition, with large patient textual datasets in the clinical field, datasets of demographic information in population studies and adverse event reports, text mining can facilitate clinical studies and precision medicine. Text mining algorithms can facilitate the stratification and indexing of specific clinical events in large patient textual datasets of symptoms, side effects, and comorbidities from electronic health records, event reports, and reports from specific diagnostic tests. One online text mining application in the biomedical literature is PubGene, a publicly accessible search engine that combines biomedical text mining with network visualization. GoPubMed is a knowledge-based search engine for biomedical texts. Text mining techniques also enable us to extract unknown knowledge from unstructured documents in the clinical domain\n\nText mining methods and software is also being researched and developed by major firms, including IBM and Microsoft, to further automate the mining and analysis processes, and by different firms working in the area of search and indexing in general as a way to improve their results.\nWithin public sector much effort has been concentrated on creating software for tracking and monitoring terrorist activities.\n\nText mining is being used by large media companies, such as the Tribune Company, to clarify information and to provide readers with greater search experiences, which in turn increases site \"stickiness\" and revenue. Additionally, on the back end, editors are benefiting by being able to share, associate and package news across properties, significantly increasing opportunities to monetize content.\n\nText mining is starting to be used in marketing as well, more specifically in analytical customer relationship management. Coussement and Van den Poel (2008)<ref name=\"10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005\"></ref> apply it to improve predictive analytics models for customer churn (customer attrition). Text mining is also being applied in stock returns prediction.\n\nSentiment analysis may involve analysis of movie reviews for estimating how favorable a review is for a movie.\nSuch an analysis may need a labeled data set or labeling of the affectivity of words.\nResources for affectivity of words and concepts have been made for WordNet and ConceptNet, respectively.\n\nText has been used to detect emotions in the related area of affective computing. Text based approaches to affective computing have been used on multiple corpora such as students evaluations, children stories and news stories.\n\nThe issue of text mining is of importance to publishers who hold large databases of information needing indexing for retrieval. This is especially true in scientific disciplines, in which highly specific information is often contained within written text. Therefore, initiatives have been taken such as Nature's proposal for an Open Text Mining Interface (OTMI) and the National Institutes of Health's common Journal Publishing Document Type Definition (DTD) that would provide semantic cues to machines to answer specific queries contained within text without removing publisher barriers to public access.\n\nAcademic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative:\n\n\nComputational methods have been developed to assist with information retrieval from scientific literature. Published approaches include methods for searching, determining novelty, and clarifying homonyms among technical reports.\n\nThe automatic analysis of vast textual corpora has created the possibility for scholars to analyze\nmillions of documents in multiple languages with very limited manual intervention. Key enabling technologies have been parsing, machine translation, topic categorization, and machine learning.\nThe automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes. This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis, whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.\n\nContent analysis has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time. The automation of content analysis has allowed a \"big data\" revolution to take place in that field, with studies in social media and newspaper content that include millions of news items. Gender bias, readability, content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on text mining methods over millions of documents. The analysis of readability, gender bias and topic bias was demonstrated in Flaounas et al. showing how different topics have different gender biases and levels of readability; the possibility to detect mood patterns in a vast population by analyzing Twitter content was demonstrated as well.\n\nText mining computer programs are available from many commercial and open source companies and sources. See List of text mining software.\n\nBecause of a lack of flexibilities in European copyright and database law, the mining of in-copyright works (such as web mining) without the permission of the copyright owner is illegal. In the UK in 2014, on the recommendation of the Hargreaves review the government amended copyright law to allow text mining as a limitation and exception. It was only the second country in the world to do so, following Japan, which introduced a mining-specific exception in 2009. However, owing to the restriction of the Copyright Directive, the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions.\n\nThe European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licenses for Europe. The fact that the focus on the solution to this legal issue was licenses, and not limitations and exceptions to copyright law, led representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.\n\nBy contrast to Europe, the flexible nature of US copyright law, and in particular fair use, means that text mining in America, as well as other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea, is viewed as being legal. As text mining is transformative, meaning that it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one such use being text and data mining.\n\nUntil recently, websites most often used text-based searches, which only found documents containing specific user-defined words or phrases. Now, through use of a semantic web, text mining can find content based on meaning and context (rather than just by a specific word). Additionally, text mining software can be used to build large dossiers of information about specific people and events. For example, large datasets based on data extracted from news reports can be built to facilitate social networks analysis or counter-intelligence. In effect, the text mining software may act in a capacity similar to an intelligence analyst or research librarian, albeit with a more limited scope of analysis. Text mining is also used in some email spam filters as a way of determining the characteristics of messages that are likely to be advertisements or other unwanted material. Text mining plays an important role in determining financial market sentiment.\n\nIncreasing interest is being paid to multilingual data mining: the ability to gain information across languages and cluster similar items from different linguistic sources according to their meaning. Popular text analytics tools includes Accern, Lexalytics, and Repustate. \n\nThe challenge of exploiting the large proportion of enterprise information that originates in \"unstructured\" form has been recognized for decades. It is recognized in the earliest definition of business intelligence (BI), in an October 1958 IBM Journal article by H.P. Luhn, A Business Intelligence System, which describes a system that will:\n\"...utilize data-processing machines for auto-abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the 'action points' in an organization. Both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points.\"\nYet as management information systems developed starting in the 1960s, and as BI emerged in the '80s and '90s as a software category and field of practice, the emphasis was on numerical data stored in relational databases. This is not surprising: text in \"unstructured\" documents is hard to process. The emergence of text analytics in its current form stems from a refocusing of research in the late 1990s from algorithm development to application, as described by Prof. Marti A. Hearst in the paper Untangling Text Data Mining:\n\nFor almost a decade the computational linguistics community has viewed large text collections as a resource to be tapped in order to produce better text analysis algorithms. In this paper, I have attempted to suggest a new emphasis: the use of large online text collections to discover new facts and trends about the world itself. I suggest that to make progress we do not need fully artificial intelligent text analysis; rather, a mixture of computationally-driven and user-guided analysis may open the door to exciting new results.\nHearst's 1999 statement of need fairly well describes the state of text analytics technology and practice a decade later.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4984404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4984404", "title": "Winnipeg Statement", "text": "Winnipeg Statement\n\nThe Winnipeg Statement is the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops' statement on the encyclical \"Humanae vitae\" from a plenary assembly held at Saint Boniface in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Published on September 27, 1968, it is the Canadian bishops' controversial document about Pope Paul VI's July 1968 encyclical on human life and the regulation of birth.\n\nSome bishops within the Catholic Church in Canada had already made moves to dissent from traditional Catholic teaching on contraception. An expert, or peritus, accompanying the Canadian bishops to the Second Vatican Council, Gregory Baum was a prominent dissident on the subject and at the third session of Vatican II Cardinal Paul-Émile Léger of Montreal advocated that the duty to bearing children should be a duty pertaining to the state of matrimony as a whole rather than to an individual act, saying that \"Confessors are assailed by doubts. They no longer know what to answer.\"\n\nPublished two months after \"Humanae vitae\", the Winnipeg Statement was an attempt by the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops to address widespread concern within the church about the prohibition of all forms of artificial contraception, and to counsel its members on how to respond to those who have difficulty accepting the directives.\n\nIt recognized that \"a certain number of Catholics\", in spite of being bound by the encyclical, find it \"either extremely difficult or even impossible to make their own all elements of this doctrine\". These\n\nWith regard to those in that situation, \"the confessor or counsellor must show sympathetic understanding and reverence for the sincere good faith of those who fail in their effort to accept some point of the encyclical.\"\n\nParagraph 26 stated:\nIn its conclusion, the document referred to the moment of the publication of the encyclical as an \"hour of crisis\", but added:\nAlthough many episcopal conferences published statements regarding \"Humanae vitae\", it is the Canadian bishops' statement which has been the subject of the most controversy, as has been widely interpreted as a loophole whereby Catholics may feel permitted to use birth control. Central to the debate is the role and importance of personal religious freedom of conscience.\n\nSome see the statement as an honest pastoral attempt to maintain unity in the Canadian church. As Bishop Alexander Carter (then President of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops) explained,\nSupporters contend that the Canadian bishops were merely trying to defend those who had not matured sufficiently in their faith, and that they were simply upholding the established doctrine expressed in \"Dignitatis humanae\", the Vatican II Declaration on Religious Freedom. They argue that it was this document which compelled the bishops \"to support the need for personal freedom when dealing with the Church's rejection of artificial contraception... [and to insist] that married couples could only form their consciences in an atmosphere free of coercion.\"\n\nSome have claimed that the statement was accepted \"with satisfaction\" by Pope Paul VI. Although this allegation is strongly disputed, it is worth noting that the Holy See has not published an official condemnation of the Winnipeg Statement, per se.\n\nThe statement was met with immediate and vocal opposition, which found root especially among conservative practicing Catholic pro-life activists. The objections of opponents to the statement are perhaps best summarized in the writings of Vincent Foy, who contends, among other things, that the Winnipeg Statement:\n\n\nFoy further alleges that Cardinal Gerald Emmett Carter, one of the authors, partially repudiated the wording of the most controversial paragraph of the statement, writing in a private letter that \"I am not prepared to defend paragraph 26 totally. In a sense, the phraseology was misleading and could give the impression that the bishops were saying that one was free to dissent at will from the Pope's teaching\".\n\nSome critics worry that the Canadian bishops have cut themselves off from Rome by rejecting an official teaching of the Catholic Church and, they feel, advancing the idea of a separate national church – suggesting that they may have formed \"a new non-Catholic church the day they signed this Winnipeg Statement.\"\n\nIn view of calls for the Canadian bishops to officially retract the Winnipeg Statement, they issued a year later a statement in which they declared: \"Nothing could be gained and much lost by an attempt to rephrase what we have said in Winnipeg. We stand squarely behind our position but we feel it is our duty to insist on a proper interpretation of that position.\" They added:\nIn 1998, the Canadian bishops voted by secret ballot on a resolution to retract the Winnipeg Statement. It did not pass.\n\nCalls for retraction continue, though some see the Canadian bishops' December 1, 1973, document, \"Statement on the Formation of Conscience\", as evidence that they were trying to distance themselves from the Winnipeg Statement.\n\nIn 2008, the Canadian bishops issued a pastoral letter titled \"Liberating Potential\" that was unquestioned as being in full conformity with \"Humanae vitae\", and invited all to \"discover or rediscover\" its message. Critics of the Winnipeg Statement saw the new document as counterbalancing what it called the \"heretical\" earlier statement.\n\nAlso in 2008, Canadian bishops unanimously stated that they were opposed to the attribution of the Order of Canada to abortion provider and pro-choice advocate Henry Morgentaler, directly quoting from the Compendium of Social Doctrine, an action that those who believed they had expressed opposition to \"Humanae vitae\" saw as distancing themselves from that opposition. Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte later announced that he was returning his award of the same order over the affair. Moreover, the bishops generally advocate pro-life views through the Catholic Organization for Life and Family, the official episcopal agency dedicated to life issues.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Evidence points to the fact that Chamanzaminli was the primary core author of the famous romance novel \"Ali and Nino\" first published in 1937 in Austria under the pen-name of Kurban Said.\n\nChamanzaminli was born the second son of seven children to Mirbaba Mirabdulla oghlu Vazirov (died 1906) and Seyid Aziza Seyid Husein gizi (died 1910) in the town of Shusha, which was then part of the Russian Empire. His father was a mugham teacher and a connoisseur of literature, who spoke Persian and Turkish and had travelled considerably throughout the region.\n\nAfter graduating from the primary school of Blindman Khalifa in 1895, Chamanzaminli pursued his studies at the Realschule of Shusha. But then, the Armenian-Azerbaijani civil war broke out (1905–1906) and his family fled Shusha. As his father had just died, his mother, younger brother and sisters settled in Ashgabad, Turkmenistan, to be closer to relatives. Vazirov managed to get a meagre stipend with a few other students from Shusha to finish his education (1906–1909) at Realni High School in Baku. He published his first work in the local Azeri-language periodicals \"Sada\" and \"Molla Nasraddin\". It was in the summer of 1907 when Yusif Vazirov went to visit his mother in Ashgabad that he met Berta Maiseyeva, a Third Year Student at Ashgabad Gymnasium. She seems to be the prototype for the character of \"Nino\" in the novel \"Ali and Nino,\" eventually published in 1937 in Vienna. In fact, many of the historical references in the novel can be traced back to the period of time when Vazirov was a high school student in Baku, as revealed in his diaries.\n\nIn 1909, Chamanzaminli left for St. Petersburg to enroll in St. Petersburg State University of Architecture and Construction Institute for Civil Engineers but having realized that he would not pass the placement test in mathematics, since he was weak in math and hated it, Chamanzaminli withdrew his application. While in St. Petersburg, he wrote \"Jannatin gabzi\" (\"A Pass to Heaven\").\n\nIn 1910 Chamanzaminli was admitted to the St. Vladimir University in Kiev to study law. When World War I broke out, the students and staff of the university were transferred to Saratov (Volga region of Russia), where Chamanzaminli graduated in 1915. For a while he worked at the judiciary chamber of Saratov and later travelled to Galicia (Eastern Europe). There, reflecting on the February Revolution in Russia, he began \"Studentlar\" (\"Students\") and \"In the Year 1917\".\n\nIn late 1917, he returned to Kiev to establish an Azerbaijani cultural association. In 1918 he was appointed to represent the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in the Ukrainian People's Republic but there was so much political unrest and turmoil in the region, he was not able to establish an office there. He then moved to Simferopol, Crimea, where he worked for a while as a judiciary advisor.\n\nThere he published his research work \"Lithuanian Tatars\" dedicated to the history and culture of Lipka Tatars. At the same time, he popularized Azeri culture by publishing related articles, especially about literature, in the local newspapers. Then in 1919, he was appointed to open the Azerbaijan Embassy in Constantinople, Turkey. He managed only to set it up only briefly for a few months before the Bolsheviks took control of Baku, leaving him without job, salary, guidance as to what to do—essentially, without a country.\n\nVazirov wrote at least two books that were published while he was in Turkey: (1) \"A Survey of Azerbaijani Literature\" (1921), and (2) \"The History, Geography and Economy of Azerbaijan\" (1921). Vazirov then left for France to join his younger brother Mir Abdulla, who was studying at the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris and from which he graduated in 1925.\n\nIn Paris where thousands of émigrés had fled in desperation after the collapse of the Russian Empire, Vazirov was unable to find a job in his field. He tried to get a job driving a taxicab but twice failed the exam. He eventually managed to get a job working in an automobile locomotive factory in the Paris suburb of Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine. He also wrote for a local publication, entitled \"Les lettres orientales\" (\"Eastern Letters\").\n\nAfter Miri's quite unexpected death, Vazirov saw little reason to continue living in Europe. He blamed Miri's death on poverty since they had not had enough money for medical care. Vazirov wrote Stalin: \"Miri's death left me with no reason not to return to Azerbaijan. I promised myself to defend the new Azerbaijan by embracing education and culture with all my strength. For me, Motherland is like a long-awaited shore after a turbulent voyage at sea.\"\n\nVazirov resolved, despite serious danger, to try to return to his Homeland and work for the strength of the Azerbaijani people. Vazirov applied for permission to return to Azerbaijan SSR from Musabeyov who sought permission from Sergey Kirov for Vazirov's return. Permission was granted in late 1925 and Vazirov returned to Baku in the spring of 1926.\n\nUpon his return, he taught languages at Azerbaijani colleges and translated various works of Russian writers into Azeri. In literary circles, he wrote several novels and became known by his penname Chamanzaminli. He took part in compiling the first Russian-Azeri Dictionary (1934).\n\nIn 1937, one of the most notorious years of Stalin's purges, there was an enormous effort on the part of Azerbaijan Writers' Union (as well as other Soviet entities) to \"purge the ranks.\" Vazirov was among the 20 or so writers targeted. He tried to defend himself, claiming that he had been one of the most courageous writers fighting against religious abuse during the pre-Soviet days. At the Third Plenum of the Azerbaijan Writers' Union (March 1937), Chairman Seyfulla Shamilov criticized a list of Azerbaijani writers including Vazirov. On June 9, 1937, at least seven articles appeared in the newspaper Adabiyyat, accusing him of being a counter-revolutionary. He was criticized for introducing counter-revolutionary ideas in his antagonist characters, especially in his novels \"Students\" and \"Maiden Spring.\"\n\nRealizing the danger he was in, Chamanzaminli burned a large collection of his manuscripts. He was stripped of his membership in Azerbaijan's Writers' Union in 1937, which greatly paralyzed his efforts to gain any employment in his field.\n\nEager and willing to work and support his wife Bilgeyiz Ajalova and three children (Orkhan, 1928–2010), Fikrat (1929–2004) and Gulara (who was probably born around 1932 and who died shortly after World War II), he wrote a letter to Mir Jafar Baghirov, First Secretary of the Communist Party. A few weeks later, realizing that no answer was forthcoming, in desperation, Chamanzaminli wrote Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, providing a review of his literary career up to that point in his life. No answer came from Stalin and so he made trips to Ashgabad and Moscow in a desperate attempt to find work but none was to be found. Returning late one night to Baku, he went underground, and remained hidden away for months in his apartment - while neighbors thought he was still in Moscow. At that time he wrote one of his most important novels - \"Between Two Worlds\" (meaning Iran and Russia). The novel was never published during his lifetime.\n\nFinally, he gained a position as a teacher of the Russian language in Urganj, Uzbekistan in 1938.\n\nBut authorities eventually managed to track Vazirov down in Urganj in 1940 and they arrested him. He was brought back to Baku for a drawn-out interrogation that lasted six months. Chamanzaminli learned that Bakir Chobanzade, a Crimean Tatar poet, had implicated him. Clearly from photos, it can be seen that Vazirov was tortured during his interrogation period. None of his family members were allowed to visit him during this time but transcripts of the \"interrogations\" show that he never admitted to the Soviet government's false accusations, nor did he implicate any fellow Azerbaijanis in an attempt to get his own sentence reduced. Condemned on fabricated charges, Vazirov was sentenced to eight years of labor camps, which he served at Unzhlag at Sukhobezvodnaya railway station, Gorky Oblast, Russia. He died of malnutrition, disease, and heart break, three years after his arrest in January 1943.\n\nExtensive research by Azerbaijan International magazine into the authorship of the novel Ali and Nino, which was published under the pseudonym Kurban Said, points to the following conclusions:\n\n(1) The core author of the novel \"Ali and Nino\" is Azerbaijani writer and statesman Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli (1887–1943) as evidenced from the content of his diaries, autobiographical essays, short stories and articles. However, others argue that Lev Nussimbaum, who wrote under the pen name of Essad Bey, was the exclusive author. Some even dismiss the possibility that Chamanzaminli could possibly have authored this novel as it was first published in German, a language they insist he did not know. However, archival documents indicate that Yusif Vazirov did reasonably well in his German class in high school. However, to discredit Chamanzaminli's authorship simply on the grounds that he didn't know German is to ignore the political crisis in the 1920s and 1930s between world wars when hundreds of thousands of foreign refugees flocked to European capitals to escape the economic collapse of four of the world's six empires (Russian, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and German). In their new setting, displaced intellectuals lost their reading public and were often at the mercy of literary brokers to get their works published. When Chamanzaminli left Paris and returned to Baku (which by that time had come under Soviet rule), one of his first short stories (1927)—\"Notebook of a Refugee\"—described the poverty-stricken conditions that refugee authors experienced, which forced them to accept 25 percent of whatever the European literary agents received.\n\n(2) The fingerprints of Lev Nussimbaum (1905–1942), who wrote under the penname of Essad Bey, can be traced in the folkloric and legendary material in the novel (although much of it is neither culturally or ethnically reliable). Identical descriptions of such material can be traced to his earlier works as he had a tendency to repeat himself in subsequent works. Lev's lack of knowledge of the Azerbaijani language also contributed to his tendency to further distort historical record which is also evident in the novel. Archival documents indicate that Lev failed the one Azerbaijani language class that he took in high school Another disadvantage was that Lev did not know the Arabic script, the official alphabet at that time in Azerbaijan.\n\n(3) Essad Bey took materials about Tbilisi and Persia directly from Georgian writer Grigol Robakidze (1882–1962) (\"Das Schlangenhemd,\" Snake Slough, 1928). Research shows that Essad Bey personally knew Robakidze.\n\n(4) Austrian Baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels (1894–1982) registered the work with German authorities, claiming that the pseudonym Kurban Said belonged to her, though evidence of her involvement in the actual writing of the novel has yet to be proven.\n\nChamanzaminli is one of Yusif Vazirov's pennames. He adopted it in remembrance of the kindness of three brothers from a small remote village in Iran called \"Chaman Zamin\" which means \"green or verdant meadow\". In desperation, the brothers had come north to Shusha to escape the terrible drought in the Tabriz region of Iran at the end of 19th century. Vazirov's father had provided them with a place to stay. In turn, after he died and Yusif himself fell desperately ill with typhoid in 1906, the brothers came to his rescue. Vazirov made a vow that if he ever became a writer he would adopt the name of their village in gratitude.\n\nVazirov began using the Chamanzaminli penname in his literary works at least as early as 1911. When Vazirov returned to Soviet Azerbaijan in 1926, he again took up the name—this time as \"Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli\".\n\nHowever, literary works that are kept at the Baku Institute of Manuscripts show that Yusif Vazirov used at least 15 different pseudonyms to protect his identity starting as early as 1904 when he was only 17 years old. Often the names he chose hold symbolic meaning, such as \"Badbakht\" (Unlucky One), \"Hagg Tarafdari\" (Protector of Justice), \"Musavi\" (Equality), \"Stradayushiy\" (Sufferer), \"Sarsam,\" (Crazy One).\n\nIn 1907, Vazirov, 20, wrote a Letter to the Editor of the satirical magazine \"Molla Nasraddin\" attacking the Muslim clergy in his hometown of Shusha. As a result, he received death threats. In his diaries, Vazirov acknowledges how foolish he was not to have used a pseudonym.\n\nIn 1911, Vazirov wrote under the name \"Ali Khan Chamanzaminili\" for the folktale \"Malak Mammad\" that he published in literary form for the first time.
