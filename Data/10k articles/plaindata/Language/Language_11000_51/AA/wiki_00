{"id": "176247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176247", "title": "Algherese dialect", "text": "Algherese dialect\n\nAlgherese (Standard Catalan: \"Alguerès\", ; Algherese: \"Alguerés\" ) is the variant of the Catalan language spoken in the city of Alghero (\"L'Alguer\" in Catalan), in the northwest of Sardinia, Italy. Catalan-speaking colonists repopulated the town and expelled the native population in 1372, after several revolts.\n\nCatalan was replaced as the official language by Spanish, then by Italian in the mid 18th century, but its use remained widespread until at least the 1970s. Today it has semi-official status alongside Italian.\n\nBased on additional linguistic studies, there are approximately 20,000 to 30,000 native speakers of the language worldwide. In communities where Algherese is spoken, Italian and Logudorese Sardinian are often used as well.\n\nAlgherese is a regional dialect spoken by anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 individuals, most of which reside in the town of Alghero, located in the northwest of Sardinia. The language, though secular, is initially derived from, and thus considered a variant of, the Catalan language. The origins of the language can be traced back to 1372, when Catalan invaders repopulated the city of Alghero after exiling the indigenous populations in Sardinia. The language has roots in several Romance languages, including Eastern Romance, Italo-Western Romance, and Italo Western.\n\nIn the northwest region of Sardinia, it is estimated that Italian is now the first language of close to 60% of individuals, Algherese approximately 22%. The use of the dialect in schools and media, to name a few, is sparse. Prior to 1997, teaching of the dialect in school was rare. However, in an attempt to reverse the trend, the Regional Council of Sardinia has officially recognized \"Algherese Catalan\" as a separate language in order to promote its use and circulation. As of a 2008 study, Algherese is used by approximately 14% of the population for daily interactions. The dialect is mostly a local language, often used to supplement Italian or Sardinian in small circles.\n\nIn the northwest region of Sardinia, where this language is spoken, Italian is the primary language. Algherese Catalan acts as a secondary language or dialect in the overall region.\n\nIn 1999, Catalan was among several minority languages officially recognized as \"historical language minorities\" by the Italian State under law no. 482/1999. Prior to this, the Regional Council of Sardinia had passed the regional law n. 26 of 15 October 1997 which, aside from promoting the equality in dignity of the Sardinian language with the Italian language throughout the island, provides that the other languages of smaller scope be afforded the same treatment as the aforementioned languages, among which Catalan is cited, in the city of Alghero. The city council, for its part, promulgated its protection and standardization in its city statute.\n\nThe following figures were obtained from the \"Enquesta d’usos lingüístics a l’Alguer (Survey of linguistic usage in Alghero, EULAL)\" of 2004, a study conducted in the town of Alghero that showed the general use of Algherese in several media, and the \"Els usos lingüístics a l’Alguer\" of 2015 (EULA 2015).\n\n\n\nThe Algherese variant is Eastern Catalan, but it has many differences from Central Catalan, with some of the most obvious ones as follows:\n\nThe following abbreviations are used: m (masculine), f (feminine), pl (plural), fpl (feminine plural), inf (informal), f (formal).\n\nThe following phrases were gathered from a Catalan translation set, but the common phrases in Algherese are similar:\n\nThe \"Premi Rafael Sari\", organised by the \"Obra Cultural de l'Alguer\", is a series of prizes awarded in September each year to the best literary works of poetry and prose written in Alguerese Catalan.\n\nNotable poets include Rafael Sari, Pasquale Scanu and Maria Chessa Lai. There is also a long tradition of writing and performing songs in Alguerese Catalan and the \"Premio Pino Piras\" is awarded for new songs written in the language. Notable singer-songwriters include Pino Piras and Franca Masu.\n\nIn 2015 Carla Valentino published an Algherese translation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's \"The Little Prince\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "366273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=366273", "title": "Brickwork", "text": "Brickwork\n\nBrickwork is masonry produced by a bricklayer, using bricks and mortar. Typically, rows of bricks—called \"courses\"— are laid on top of one another to build up a structure such as a brick wall.\n\nBrick may be differentiated from a block on the ground of mainly in variation in size. For example in UK brick is defined as a unit dimensions less than 337.5x225x112.5mm and a bock is defined as a unit having one or more dimensions greater than largest possible brick\n\nBrick is a popular medium for constructing buildings, and examples of brickwork are found through history as far back as the Bronze Age. The fired-brick faces of the ziggurat of ancient Dur-Kurigalzu in Iraq date from around 1400 BC, and the brick buildings of ancient Mohenjo-daro in Pakistan were built around 2600 BC. Much older examples of brickwork made with dried (but not fired) bricks may be found in such ancient locations as Jericho in Judea, Çatal Hüyük in Anatolia, and Mehrgarh in Pakistan. These structures have survived from the Stone Age to the present day.\nBrick dimensions are expressed in construction or technical documents in two ways as co-ordinating dimensions and working dimensions.\nBrick size may be slightly different due to shrinkage or distortion due to firing etc.\n\nAn example of a co-ordinating metric commonly used for bricks in the UK is as follows:\n\nIn this case the co-ordinating metric works because the length of a single brick (215 mm) is equal to the total of the width of a brick (102.5 mm) plus a perpend (10 mm) plus the width of a second brick (102.5 mm).\n\nThere are many other brick sizes worldwide, and many of them use this same co-ordinating principle.\n\nAs the most common bricks are cuboids, six surfaces are named as followed:\nMortar placed between bricks is also given separate names with respect to their position. Mortar placed horizontally below or top of a brick is called a bed, and mortar Placed vertically between bricks is called a perpend.\n\nBrick made with just rectilinear dimensions is called a solid brick. Bricks might have depression on both beds or single bed these are called frogged bricks an the depression is called frog. Frogs can be deep or shallow but should never exceed 20% of the total value of the brick. Cellular bricks have depressions exceeding 20% of the volume of the brick. Perforated bricks have holes through the bed to bed cutting it all the way. Most of the building standards and good construction practices recommend the volume of holes should not exceeding 20% of the total volume of the brick.\nParts of brickwork include \"bricks\", \"beds\" and \"perpends\". The bed is the mortar upon which a brick is laid. A perpend is a vertical joint between any two bricks and is usually—but not always—filled with mortar.\n\nA brick is given a classification based on how it is laid, and how the exposed face is oriented relative to the face of the finished wall.\n\n\nThe practice of laying uncut full-sized bricks wherever possible gives brickwork its maximum possible strength. In the diagrams below, such uncut full-sized bricks are coloured as follows:\n\nOccasionally though a brick must be cut to fit a given space, or to be the right shape for fulfilling some particular purpose such as generating an offset—called a \"lap\"—at the beginning of a course. In some cases these special shapes or sizes are manufactured. In the diagrams below, some of the cuts most commonly used for generating a lap are coloured as follows:\n\n\nLess frequently used cuts are all coloured as follows:\n\n\nA nearly universal rule in brickwork is that perpends should not be contiguous across courses.\n\nWalls, running linearly and extending upwards, can be of varying depth or thickness. Typically, the bricks are laid also running linearly and extending upwards, forming \"wythes\" or \"leafs\". It is as important as with the perpends to bond these leaves together. Historically, the dominant method for consolidating the leaves together was to lay bricks across them, rather than running linearly.\n\nBrickwork observing either or both of these two conventions is described as being laid in one or another \"bond\".\n\nA leaf is as thick as the width of one brick, but a wall is said to be one brick thick if it as wide as the length of a brick. Accordingly, a single-leaf wall is a half brick thickness; a wall with the simplest possible masonry transverse bond is said to be one brick thick, and so on.\n\nThe thickness specified for a wall is determined by such factors as damp proofing considerations, whether or not the wall has a cavity, load-bearing requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working. Wall thickness specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in partition walls, others brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base. The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.\n\nThe advent during the mid twentieth century of the cavity wall saw the popularisation and development of another method of strengthening brickwork—the wall tie. A cavity wall comprises two totally discrete walls, separated by an air gap, which serves both as barrier to moisture and heat. Typically the main loads taken by the foundations are carried there by the inner leaf, and the major functions of the external leaf are to protect the whole from weather, and to provide a fitting aesthetic finish.\n\nDespite there being no masonry connection between the leaves, their transverse rigidity still needs to be guaranteed. The device used to satisfy this need is the insertion at regular intervals of wall ties into the cavity wall's mortar beds.\n\nThis bond has one stretcher between headers, with the headers centred over the stretchers in the courses below.\n\nWhere a course begins with a quoin stretcher, the course will ordinarily terminate with a quoin stretcher at the other end. The next course up will begin with a quoin header. For the course's second brick, a queen closer is laid, generating the lap of the bond. The third brick along is a stretcher, and is—on account of the lap—centred above the header below. This second course then resumes its paired run of stretcher and header, until the final pair is reached, whereupon a second and final queen closer is inserted as the penultimate brick, mirroring the arrangement at the beginning of the course, and duly closing the bond.\n\nSome examples of Flemish bond incorporate stretchers of one colour and headers of another. This effect is commonly a product of treating the header face of the heading bricks while the bricks are being baked as part of the manufacturing process. Some of the header faces are exposed to wood smoke, generating a grey-blue colour, while other simply vitrified until they reach a deeper blue colour. Some headers have a glazed face, caused by using salt in the firing. Sometimes Staffordshire Blue bricks are used for the heading bricks.\n\nBrickwork that appears as Flemish bond from both the front and the rear is \"double Flemish bond\", so called on account of the front and rear duplication of the pattern. If the wall is arranged such that the bricks at the rear do not have this pattern, then the brickwork is said to be \"single Flemish bond\".\n\nFlemish bond brickwork with a thickness of one brick is the repeating pattern of a stretcher laid immediately to the rear of the face stretcher, and then next along the course, a header. A lap (correct overlap) is generated by a queen closer on every alternate course:\n\nA simple way to add some width to the wall would be to add stretching bricks at the rear, making a Single Flemish bond one and a half bricks thick:\n\nFor a double Flemish bond of one and a half bricks' thickness, facing bricks and the bricks behind the facing bricks may be laid in groups of four bricks and a half-bat. The half-bat sits at the centre of the group and the four bricks are placed about the half-bat, in a square formation. These groups are laid next to each other for the length of a course, making brickwork one and a half bricks thick.\n\nTo preserve the bond, it is necessary to lay a three-quarter bat instead of a header following a quoin stretcher at the corner of the wall. This fact has no bearing on the appearance of the wall; the choice of brick appears to the spectator like any ordinary header:\n\nFor a more substantial wall, a header may be laid directly behind the face header, a further two headers laid at 90° behind the face stretcher, and then finally a stretcher laid to the rear of these two headers. This pattern generates brickwork a full two bricks thick:\n\nFor a still more substantial wall, \"two\" headers may be laid directly behind the face header, a further two \"pairs\" of headers laid at 90° behind the face stretcher, and then finally a stretcher laid to the rear of these four headers. This pattern generates brickwork a full three bricks thick:\n\nThis bond has two stretchers between every header with the headers centred over the perpend between the two stretchers in the course below in the bond's most symmetric form.\n\nThe great variety of monk bond patterns allow for many possible layouts at the quoins, and many possible arrangements for generating a lap. A quoin brick may be a stretcher, a three-quarter bat, or a header. Queen closers may be used next to the quoins, but the practice is not mandatory.\n\nMonk bond may however take any of a number of arrangements for course staggering. The disposal of bricks in these often highly irregular raking patterns can be a challenging task for the bricklayer to correctly maintain while constructing a wall whose courses are partially obscured by scaffold, and interrupted by door or window openings, or other bond-disrupting obstacles. If the bricklayer frequently stops to check that bricks are correctly arranged, then masonry in a raking monk bond can be expensive to build.\n\nOccasionally, brickwork in such a raking monk bond may contain minor errors of header and stretcher alignment some of which may have been silently corrected by incorporating a compensating irregularity into the brickwork in a course further up the wall. In spite of these complexities and their associated costs, the bond has proven a common choice for constructing brickwork in the north of Europe.\n\nRaking courses in monk bond may—for instance—be staggered in such a way as to generate the appearance of diagonal lines of stretchers. One method of achieving this effect relies on the use of a repeating sequence of courses with back-and-forth header staggering. In this grouping, a header appears at a given point in the group's first course. In the next course up, a header is offset one and a half stretcher lengths to the left of the header in the course below, and then in the third course, a header is offset one stretcher length to the right of the header in the middle course. This accented swing of headers, one and a half to the left, and one to the right, generates the appearance of lines of stretchers running from the upper left hand side of the wall down to the lower right. Such an example of a raking monk bond layout is shown in the New Malden Library, Kingston upon Thames, Greater London.\n\nElsewhere, raking courses in monk bond may be staggered in such a way as to generate a subtle appearance of indented pyramid-like diagonals. Such an arrangement appears in the picture here from the building in Solna, Sweden.\n\nMany other particular adjustments of course alignment exist in monk bond, generating a variety of visual effects which differ in detail, but often having the effect of directing a viewing eye diagonally down the wall.\n\nThis bond has three stretchers between every header, with the headers centred above the midpoint of three stretchers in the course below.\n\nThe bond's horizontally extended proportion suits long stretches of masonry such as garden walls or the run of brickwork over a ribbon window; conversely, the bond is less suitable for a surface occupied by many features, such as a Georgian façade. The relatively infrequent use of headers serves to make Sussex bond one of the less expensive bonds in which to build a wall, as it allows for the bricklayer to proceed rapidly with run after run of three stretchers at a time.\n\nOne of the two kinds of course in this family of bonds is called a \"stretching course\", and this typically comprises nothing but stretchers at the face from quoin to quoin. The other kind of course is the \"heading course\", and this usually consists of headers, with two queen closers—one by the quoin header at either end—to generate the bond.\n\nThis bond has alternating stretching and heading courses, with the headers centred over the midpoint of the stretchers, and perpends in each alternate course aligned. Queen closers appear as the second brick, and the penultimate brick in heading courses. A muted colour scheme for occasional headers is sometimes used in English bond to lend a subtle texture to the brickwork. Examples of such schemes include blue-grey headers among otherwise red bricks—seen in the south of England—and light brown headers in a dark brown wall, more often found in parts of the north of England.\n\nAn ancient example of alternating courses of headers and stretchers, is found on Malta. The ruins of the Ggantija Temple on the island of Gozo consist of two temples and a surrounding wall dating back to the Neolithic Age (3600–250 BCE); some stones are as long as 5 meters weighing over 50 tonnes.\n\nThis bond also has alternating stretching and heading courses. However, whilst the heading courses are identical with those found in the standard English bond, the stretching courses alternate between a course composed entirely of stretchers, and a course composed of stretchers half off-set relative to the stretchers two courses above or below, by reason of a header placed just before the quoins at either end. The bond is widely found in Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nLarge areas of English cross bond can appear to have a twill like characteristic, an effect caused by the unbroken series of perpends moving diagonally down the bond.\n\nThis bond is exactly like English cross bond except in the generating of the lap at the quoins. In Dutch bond, all quoins are three-quarter bats—placed in alternately stretching and heading orientation with successive courses—and no use whatever is made of queen closers. To the Dutch this is simply a variant of what they call a cross bond.\nThis bond has three courses of stretchers between every course of headers.\n\nFor the standard English garden wall bond, headers are used as quoins for the middle stretching course in order to generate the lap, with queen closers as the penultimate brick at either end of the heading courses. A more complex set of quoins and queen closers is necessary to achieve the lap for a raking English garden wall bond.\n\nThe heading course in English garden wall bond sometimes features bricks of a different colour to its surrounding stretchers. In English chalk districts, flint is substituted for the stretchers, and the headers constitute a lacing course.\n\nThis bond has five courses of stretchers between every course of headers.\n\nThe lap is generated by the use of headers as quoins for the even numbered stretching courses, counting up from the previous heading course, with queen closers as the penultimate brick at either end of the heading courses.\n\nThis bond may have between three and nine courses of stretchers between each course of headers.\n\nHeaders are used as quoins for the even numbered stretching courses, counting up from the previous heading course, in order to achieve the necessary off-set in a standard American bond, with queen closers as the penultimate brick at either end of the heading courses.\n\nThe brick Clarke-Palmore House in Henrico County, Virginia, has a lower level built in 1819 described as being American bond of three to five stretching courses between each heading course, and an upper level built in 1855 with American bond of six to seven stretching courses between each heading course.\n\nAll bricks in this bond are headers, but for the lap-generating quoin three-quarter bat which offsets each successive courses by half a header.\n\nHeader bond is often used on curving walls with a small radius of curvature. In Lewes, Sussex, England UK many small buildings are constructed in this bond, using blue coloured bricks and vitrified surfaces.\n\nAll bricks in this bond are stretchers, with the bricks in each successive course staggered by half a stretcher. Headers are used as quoins on alternating stretching courses in order to achieve the necessary off-set.\n\nIt is the simplest repeating pattern, and will create a wall only one-half brick thick. Such a thin wall is not stable enough to stand alone, and must be tied to a supporting structure. This practice is common in modern buildings, where stretcher bonded brickwork may be the outer face of a cavity wall, or the facing to a timber or steel-framed structure.\n\nAlso consists entirely of courses of stretchers, but with the bricks in each successive course staggered in some pattern other than that of standard stretcher bond.\n\nFlemish stretcher bond separates courses of alternately laid stretchers and headers, with a number of courses of stretchers alone. Brickwork in this bond may have between one and four courses of stretchers to one course after the Flemish manner. The courses of stretchers are often but not always staggered in a raking pattern.\n\nRat-trap bond (also Chinese bond) substantially observes the same pattern as Flemish bond, but consists of rowlocks and shiners instead of headers and stretchers. This gives a wall with an internal cavity bridged by the rowlocks, hence the reference to rat-traps.\n\nDearne's bond substantially observes the same pattern as English bond, but uses shiners in place of stretchers.\n\nA row of single basket weave bond comprises pairs of sailors laid side-by-side, capped with a shiner, alternating with pairs of sailors laid side-by-side sat atop a shiner. Subsequent rows are identical and aligned with those above.\n\nA row of double basket weave bond comprises pairs of shiners laid atop one another, alternating with pairs of sailors laid side-by-side. The following row is off-set so the pair of shiners sits below the pair of sailors in the row above. This results in bricks arranged in pairs in a square grid so that the join between each pair is perpendicular to the join of the four pairs around it.\n\nThe herringbone pattern (opus spicatum) made by placing soldiers next to stretchers or vice versa (i.e. headers perpendicular) making 'L' shapes, nesting each L in the same order of laying. Thin bricks are more common. The pattern is usually rotated by 45° to create a completely vertical (plumb) succession of 'V' shapes. It follows either the left or right brick forms the tip of the v in any wall. Herringbone is sometimes used as infill in timber framed buildings.\n\nPinwheel bond is made of four bricks surrounding a square half-brick, repeated in a square grid.\n\nA pattern made of four bricks surrounding a square brick, one-quarter the size of a half-brick. It is designed to resemble woven cloth. Another, similar pattern is called the interlacing bond.\n\nBrickwork formed into a diamond pattern is called diapering.\n\nFlemish diagonal bond comprises a complex pattern of stretcher courses alternating with courses of one or two stretchers between headers, at various offsets such that over ten courses a diamond-shaped pattern appears.\n\nMoisture may ascend into a building from the foundation of a wall or gain ingress into a building from a wet patch of ground, where it meets a solid wall. The manifest result of this process is called damp. One of many methods of resisting such ingresses of water is to construct the wall with several low courses of dense engineering bricks such as Staffordshire blue bricks. This method of damp proofing appears as a distinctive navy blue band running around the circumference of a building. It is only partially effective, as in spite of the lower courses of brick being more moisture resistant the mortar bedding and perpends joining the bricks remain permeable.\n\n\n\n"}

In saddle-stitched magazines (as opposed to those that are perfect-bound), the centerfold does not have any blank space cutting through the image.\n\nThe term was coined by Hugh Hefner, founder of \"Playboy\" magazine. The success of the first issue of \"Playboy\" has been attributed in large part to its centerfold: a nude of Marilyn Monroe. The advent of monthly centerfolds gave the pin-up a new respectability, and helped to sanitize the notion of \"sexiness\". Being featured as a centerfold could lead to film roles for models, and still occasionally does today.\n\nEarly on, Hefner required \"Playboy\" centerfolds to be portrayed in a very specific way, telling photographers in a 1956 memo that the \"model must be in a natural setting engaged in some activity 'like reading, writing, mixing a drink'...[and]... should have a 'healthy, intelligent, American look—a young lady that looks like she might be a very efficient secretary or an undergrad at Vassar.'\" Hefner later said that the ideal centerfold is one in which \"a situation is suggested, the presence of someone not in the picture\"; the goal was to transform \"a straight pinup into an intimate interlude, something personal and special.\"\n\nSome magazines later adopted the practice of having a trifold or quatrefold centerfold, using a longer sheet of paper at that spot and folding the extra length into the magazine. Racier adult magazines used this space to showcase more explicit imagery: \"In order to represent breasts, genitals, anus, and face all within the tri-fold frame of the centerfold, models were propped up, legs spread, raised, and then jack- knifed against their bodies, arms plunged between them to spread the labia.\"\n\nThough the term has become linked in the public consciousness with erotic material or models, many other magazines such as \"Life\", \"Time\" and \"National Geographic\" have published fold-out spreads on other subjects.\n\nSome magazines will refer to their centerfold models with a specific name, which may be connected to the magazine's brand or theme.\nWhen obtained from one of the more prestigious publications in the field, it can become a semi-formal personal title used in news articles and introductions long after the model's centerfold appearance.\n\nSome online-only media outlets maintain a monthly designation reminiscent of a print magazine centerfold; for example, the \"Twistys\" Treat.\n"}

{"id": "1738759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1738759", "title": "Expressivism", "text": "Expressivism\n\nIn meta-ethics, expressivism is a theory about the meaning of moral language. According to expressivism, sentences that employ moral terms – for example, \"It is wrong to torture an innocent human being\" – are not descriptive or fact-stating; moral terms such as \"wrong\", \"good\", or \"just\" do not refer to real, in-the-world properties. The primary function of moral sentences, according to expressivism, is not to assert any matter of fact, but rather to express an evaluative attitude toward an object of evaluation. Because the function of moral language is non-descriptive, moral sentences do not have any truth conditions. Hence, expressivists either do not allow that moral sentences have truth value, or rely on a notion of truth that does not appeal to any descriptive truth conditions being met for moral sentences.\n\nExpressivism is a form of moral anti-realism or nonfactualism: the view that there are no moral facts that moral sentences describe or represent, and no moral properties or relations to which moral terms refer. Expressivists deny constructivist accounts of moral facts – e.g. Kantianism – as well as realist accounts – e.g. ethical intuitionism. \n\nBecause expressivism claims that the function of moral language is not descriptive, it allows the irrealist to avoid an error theory: the view that ordinary moral thought and discourse is committed to deep and pervasive error, and that all moral statements make false ontological claims.\n\nExpressivism does not hold that the function of moral sentences as used in ordinary discourse is to describe the speaker's moral attitudes. Expressivists are united in rejecting ethical subjectivism: the descriptivist view that utterances of the type \"X is good/bad\" mean \"I approve/disapprove of X\". Subjectivism is a descriptivist theory, not an expressivist one, because it maintains that moral sentences are used to represent facts – namely, facts about the subject's psychological states.\n\nSome early versions of expressivism arose during the early twentieth century in association with logical positivism. These early views are typically called \"noncognitivist\". A. J. Ayer's emotivism is a well-known example. \n\nAccording to emotivism, the act of uttering a moral sentence of the type \"X is good (bad)\" is closely akin to the expression of a positive (or negative) emotional attitude toward X, and such an utterance can be paraphrased by \"Hurrah for X!\" or \"Boo, X!\"\n\nC. L. Stevenson also advanced an important version of emotivism.\n\nAt the beginning of the middle of the twentieth century, R. M. Hare was an important advocate of expressivism / noncognitivism. Hare's view is called prescriptivism because he analyzed moral sentences as universal, overriding prescriptions or imperatives. A prescriptivist might paraphrase \"X is good\" as \"Do X!\".\n\nMore recent versions of expressivism, such as Simon Blackburn's \"quasi-realism\", Allan Gibbard's \"norm-expressivism\", and Mark Timmons' and Terence Horgan's \"cognitivist expressivism\" tend to distance themselves from the \"noncognitivist\" label applied to Ayer, Stevenson, and Hare. What distinguishes these \"new wave\" expressivists is that they resist reductive analyses of moral sentences or their corresponding psychological states, moral judgments, and they allow for moral sentences/judgments to have truth value. \n\nHorgan and Timmons' label \"cognitivist expressivism\" in particular captures the philosophical commitment they share with Blackburn and Gibbard to regard moral judgments as cognitive psychological states, i.e. beliefs, and moral sentences as vehicles for genuine assertions or truth-claims. Much of the current expressivist project is occupied with defending a theory of the truth of moral sentences that is consistent with expressivism but can resist the Frege-Geach objection (see below). Expressivists tend to rely on a minimalist or deflationary theory of truth to provide an irrealist account for the truth of moral sentences.\n\nAccording to the open question argument (originally articulated by intuitionist and non-naturalist G. E. Moore), for any proposed definition of a moral term, e.g. \" 'good' = 'the object of desire' \", a competent speaker of English who understands the meaning of the terms involved in the statement of the definition could still hold that the question, \"Is the object of desire good?\" remains unanswered.\n\nThe upshot of this argument is that normative or moral terms cannot be analytically reduced to \"natural\" or non-moral terms. Expressivists argue that the best explanation of this irreducibility is that moral terms are not used to describe objects, but rather to evaluate them. Many philosophers regard expressivists or noncognitivists as \"the real historical beneficiar[ies] of the open question argument.\"\n\nSome moral realists maintain that a \"synthetic\" reduction of moral terms to natural terms is possible. Other realists (including Moore himself) have concluded that moral terms refer to non-natural, sui generis properties or relations; but non-naturalism is vulnerable to the argument from queerness (see below).\n\nPersons may disagree in their moral evaluations of the same object, while possessing all the same information about the \"natural\" or descriptive facts about the object of evaluation. Expressivists argue that such deep moral disagreement is evidence that moral judgment is not a species of descriptive or factual judgment.\n\nThe Frege–Geach problem – named for Peter Geach, who developed it from the writings of Gottlob Frege – claims that by subscribing to expressivism one necessarily accepts that the meaning of \"It is wrong to tell lies\" is different from the meaning of the \"it is wrong to tell lies\" part of the conditional \"If it is wrong to tell lies, then it is wrong to get your little brother to lie\", and that therefore expressivism is an inadequate explanation for moral language.\n\nFrege–Geach contends that \"It is wrong to get your little brother to tell lies\" can be deduced from the two premises by \"modus ponens\" as follows:\n\n\nIn the second statement the expressivist account appears to fail, in that the speaker asserting the hypothetical premise is expressing no moral position towards lying, condemnatory or otherwise. The expressivist thus cannot account for the meaning of moral language in this kind of unasserted context. This problem assumes that logic only applies to real truth values.\n\nTerence Cuneo argues against expressivism by means of the following premise:\nIt is false that, in ordinary optimal conditions, when an agent performs the sentential act of sincerely uttering a moral sentence, that agent does not thereby intend to assert a moral proposition, but intends to express an attitude toward a non-moral state of affairs or object.\nProponents of expressivism are concerned to preserve the participants in ordinary moral thought and discourse from charges of deep error. But, Cuneo argues, there is evidence that many such participants do intend to represent a factual moral reality when they make moral judgments. Hence, if the expressivists are correct and moral language is not properly used to make factual, descriptive assertions, many participants in ordinary moral discourse are frustrated in their illocutionary act intentions. On these grounds it is argued that we should give up expressivism, unless the expressivists are to give up on their claim that expressivism is not an essentially revisionist view of moral thought and discourse.\n\n"}

Thanks to the testimonies of the Arabs, the West has always known that ancient Egypt was a country of mummies. Today, we know most of the process of mummification, desiccation of bodies obtained through the dry climate of Egypt, the removal of viscera, the use of natron and bandages. Similarly, we know what kind of rituals accompanied the preparation of the corpse, who were responsible for the mummification process. As for why the mummification, it is related to the Egyptian religion, for which it is the guarantee of immortality, the possibility of a new life (life after death).\n\nBased on recent radiographic and genetic analyses of bodies, Françoise Dunand and Roger Lichtenberg take stock of the historical knowledge of mummies, and add a scientific dimension in this small colourful book— (lit. \"The Mummies: A Journey into Eternity\"; US edition – \"Mummies: A Voyage Through Eternity\"; UK edition – \"Mummies: A Journey Through Eternity\")—published by Éditions Gallimard in the series of their collection. According to standards of the collection, the book is richly documented with more than 200 illustrations—drawings, paintings, sculptures, X-ray photographs of mummies, etc., which illustrate the body copy as the pages are pretty equally shared between images and texts—and printed on glossy paper.\n\nThis book is an archaeological and anthropological study on funeral practices in ancient Egypt. It opens with full-page head shots of nine mummies from the necropolis at Duch excavated by Dunand's IFAO team. Images from the excavation at the Duch necropolis are also some of the book's highlights. The authors approach the subject from different angles: the discoveries of mummies by the Western world (chap. Ⅰ, \"Mummies Come to Light\"), such as the writings of Herodotus and curiosity of Egyptomania in the 19th century, up to the scientific research of the 20th century with the contribution of radiology techniques (chap. Ⅴ, \"Under Expert Analysis\"). The second chapter—\"Making a Better Mummy\"—deals with how the ancient Egyptians mummified a body, while the third chapter, \"Toward Immortality\", illustrated with ancient paintings explaining the rites and beliefs. Chapter Ⅳ, \"From Eternal Life to Harsh Reality\" tells the valuable offerings which the ancient Egyptians furnished with their dead, and the direct consequence of this: the pillaging of tombs. In the last chapter (chap.

{"id": "647131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=647131", "title": "Greenlandic language", "text": "Greenlandic language\n\nGreenlandic is an Eskimo–Aleut language spoken by about 56,000 Greenlandic Inuit in Greenland. It is closely related to the Inuit languages in Canada such as Inuktitut. The main variety, Kalaallisut or West Greenlandic, has been the official language of the Greenlandic autonomous territory since June 2009; this is a move by the Naalakkersuisut (government of Greenland) to strengthen the language in its competition with the colonial language, Danish. The second variety is Tunumiit oraasiat or East Greenlandic. The Thule Inuit of Greenland, Inuktun or Polar Eskimo, is a recent arrival and a dialect of Inuktitut.\n\nGreenlandic is a polysynthetic language that allows the creation of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument (\"subject\") of an intransitive verb like the object of a transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent (\"subject\") of a transitive verb.\n\nNouns are inflected for one of the eight cases and for possession. Verbs are inflected for one of the eight moods and for the number and person of its subject and object. Both nouns and verbs have complex derivational morphology. Basic word order in transitive clauses is subject–object–verb. Subordination of clauses is done by the use of special subordinate moods. A so-called fourth-person category enables switch-reference between main clauses and subordinate clauses with different subjects. Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of grammatical tense, as temporal relations are normally expressed through context, through the use of temporal particles such as \"yesterday\" or \"now\" or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with aspectual meanings with the semantic aktionsart of different verbs. However, some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily. Another question is whether the language has noun incorporation, or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.\n\nWhen adopting new concepts or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and English. The language has been written in the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s. The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because of a number of sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now among the highest in the world.\n\nThe Greenlandic language was brought to Greenland with the arrival of the Thule people in the 1200s. It is unknown which languages were spoken by the earlier Saqqaq and Dorset cultures in Greenland.\n\nThe first descriptions of Greenlandic date from the 1600s, and with the arrival of Danish missionaries in the early 1700s, and the beginning of Danish colonialism in Greenland, the compilation of dictionaries and description of grammar began. The missionary Paul Egede wrote the first Greenlandic dictionary in 1750, and the first grammar in 1760.\nFrom the Danish colonization in the 1700s to the beginning of Greenlandic home rule in 1979, Greenlandic experienced increasing pressure from the Danish language. In the 1950s, Denmark's linguistic policies were directed at strengthening Danish. \nOf primary significance was that post-primary education and official functions were conducted in Danish.\n\nFrom 1851 to 1973, Greenlandic was written in a complicated orthography devised by the missionary linguist Samuel Kleinschmidt. In 1973, a new orthography was introduced, intended to bring the written language closer to the spoken standard, which had changed considerably since Kleinschmidt's time. The reform was effective and in the years following it, Greenlandic literacy received a boost.\n\nAnother development that strengthened the Greenlandic language has been the policy of \"greenlandization\" of Greenlandic society which began with the homerule agreement of 1979. This policy has worked to reverse the former trend towards marginalization of the Greenlandic language by making it the official language of education. The fact that Greenlandic has become the only language used in primary schooling has meant that today monolingual Danish-speaking parents in Greenland are raising children bilingual in Danish and Greenlandic. Today Greenlandic has several dedicated news media: the Greenlandic National Radio, Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa, which provides television and radio programming in Greenlandic. The newspaper Sermitsiaq, has been published since 1958, and in 2010 merged with the other newspaper \"Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten\", which was established already in 1861 to form a single large Greenlandic language publishing house.\n\nBefore June 2009, Greenlandic shared its status as the official language in Greenland with Danish. Since then, Greenlandic has become the sole official language. This has made Greenlandic a unique example of an indigenous language of the Americas that is recognized by law as the only official language of a semi-independent country. Nevertheless, it is still considered to be in a \"vulnerable\" state by the UNESCO Red Book of Language Endangerment. The country has a 100% literacy rate. As the Western Greenlandic standard has become dominant, a UNESCO report has labelled the other dialects as endangered, and measures are now being considered to protect the Eastern Greenlandic dialect.\n\nKalaallisut and the other Greenlandic dialects belong to the Eskimo–Aleut family and are closely related to the Inuit languages of Canada and Alaska. Illustration 1 shows the locations of the different Eskimoan languages, among them the three main dialects of Greenlandic.\nThe most prominent Greenlandic dialect is West Greenlandic \"(Kalaallisut),\" which is the official language of Greenland. The name \"Kalaallisut\" is often used as a cover term for all of Greenlandic. The northern dialect, \"Inuktun (Avanersuarmiutut),\" spoken in the vicinity of the city of Qaanaaq (Thule), is particularly closely related to Canadian Inuktitut. The eastern dialect \"(Tunumiit oraasiat)\", spoken in the vicinity of Ammassalik Island and Ittoqqortoormiit, is the most innovative of the Greenlandic dialects, having assimilated consonant clusters and vowel sequences to a greater extent than West Greenlandic. Kalaallisut is further divided into four subdialects. One that is spoken around Upernavik has certain similarities to East Greenlandic, possibly because of a previous migration from eastern Greenland. A second dialect is spoken in the region of Uummannaq and the Disko Bay. The standard language is based on the central Kalaallisut dialect spoken in Sisimiut in the north, around Nuuk and as far south as Maniitsoq. Southern Kalaallisut is spoken around Narsaq and Qaqortoq in the south. Table 1 shows the differences in the pronunciation of the word for \"humans\" in the three main dialects. It can be seen that Inuktun is the most conservative, maintaining the \"gh\" which has been elided in Kalaallisut, and Tunumiisut is the most innovative, having further simplified the structure by eliding the .\n\nLetters between slashes indicate phonemic transcription, letters in square brackets indicate phonetic transcription and letters in triangular brackets indicate standard Greenlandic orthography.\n\nThe Greenlandic three vowel system, composed of , , and , is typical for an Eskimo–Aleut language. Double vowels are analyzed as two morae, so they are phonologically a vowel sequence and not a long vowel; they are also written as two vowels in the orthography. The only diphthong in the language is , which occurs only at the ends of words. Before a uvular consonant ( or ), is realized allophonically as , or , and is realized allophonically as or , and the two vowels are written \"e, o\" respectively (as in some orthographies used for Quechua and Aymara). becomes retracted to in the same environment. is rounded to before labial consonants. is fronted to between two coronal consonants.\n\nThe allophonic lowering of and before uvular consonants is shown in the modern orthography by writing and as and respectively before uvulars and . For example:\n\nGreenlandic has consonants at five points of articulation: labial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular. It does not have phonemic voicing contrast, but rather distinguishes stops from fricatives. It distinguishes stops, fricatives, and nasals at the labial, alveolar, velar, and uvular points of articulation. The earlier palatal sibilant has merged with in all but a few dialects. The labiodental fricative is only contrastive in loanwords. The alveolar stop is pronounced as an affricate before the high front vowel . Often, Danish loanwords containing preserve these in writing, although this does not imply a change in pronunciation, for example \"beer\" and \"God\"; these are pronounced exactly as .\n\nThe Kalaallisut syllable is simple, allowing syllables of (C)(V)V(C), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel and VV is a double vowel or word-final . Native words may only begin with a vowel or ; they may end only in or rarely . Consonant clusters only occur over syllable boundaries and their pronunciation is subject to regressive assimilations that convert them into geminates. All non-nasal consonants in a cluster are voiceless.\n\nGreenlandic prosody does not include stress as an autonomous category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced in a way that may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.\n\nGeminate consonants are pronounced long, almost exactly with the double duration of a single consonant.\n\nIntonation in indicative clauses usually rises on the antepenultimate syllable, falls on the penult and rises on the last syllable. Interrogative intonation rises on the penultimate and falls on the last syllable.\n\nGreenlandic phonology distinguishes itself phonologically from the other Inuit languages by a series of assimilations.\n\nGreenlandic phonology allows clusters, but it does not allow clusters of two different consonants unless the first one is . In all other cases the first consonant in a cluster is assimilated to the second one resulting in a geminate consonant. Geminate is pronounced and written . Geminate is pronounced . Geminate is pronounced but is written . Geminate is pronounced . Geminate is pronounced and written . is also pronounced and written after .\n\nThese assimilations mean that one of the most recognizable Inuktitut words, \"iglu\" (\"house\"), is \"illu\" in Greenlandic, where the consonant cluster of Inuktitut is assimilated into a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative. And the word \"Inuktitut\" itself, when translated into Kalaallisut, becomes \"Inuttut\". The Old Greenlandic diphthong has assimilated to .\n\nThe consonant has disappeared when between and or . This means that affixes beginning with -va or -vi have forms without when suffixed to stems ending in .\n\nThe vowel of modern Greenlandic is the result of a historic merger of the Proto-Eskimo–Aleut vowels *i and *ɪ. The fourth vowel was still present in Old Greenlandic as attested by Hans Egede. In modern West Greenlandic the difference between the two original vowels can only be discerned morphophonologically in certain environments. The vowel that was originally *ɪ has the variant when preceding another vowel and sometimes disappears before certain suffixes.\n\nThe degree to which the assimilation of consonant clusters has taken place is an important dialectal feature separating Polar Eskimo, Inuktun, which still allows some ungeminated consonant clusters, from West and East Greenlandic. East Greenlandic (\"Tunumiit oraasiat\") has shifted some geminate consonants, e.g. to . Thus, for example, the East Greenlandic name of a particular town is Ittoqqortoormiit, which would appear as \"Illoqqortoormiut\" in Kalaallisut.\n\nThe morphology of Greenlandic is highly synthetic and exclusively suffixing, with the exception of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem. In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5. The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.\n\nThere are few compound words, but lots of derivations. The grammar employs a mixture of head and dependent marking: both agent and patient are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while dependent noun phrases inflect for case. The morphosyntactic alignment of Kalaallisut is ergative.\n\nThe language distinguishes four persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th or 3rd reflexive (see Obviation and switch-reference), two numbers (singular and plural; no dual as in Inuktitut), eight moods (indicative, participial, imperative/optative, interrogative, past subjunctive, future subjunctive and habitual subjunctive) and eight cases (absolutive, ergative, equative, instrumental, locative, allative, ablative and prolative). Verbs carry a bipersonal inflection for subject and object. Possessive noun phrases inflect for their possessor, as well as for case.\n\nIn this section the examples are written in Greenlandic standard orthography except that morpheme boundaries are indicated by a hyphen.\n\nGreenlandic distinguishes three open word classes: nouns, verbs and particles. Verbs inflect for person and number of subject and object as well as for mood. Nouns inflect for possession and for case. Particles do not inflect.\nThe verb is the only word required to build a sentence. Since verbs inflect for number and person of both subject and object, the verb is in fact a clause itself. Therefore, clauses where all participants are expressed as free-standing noun phrases are rather rare. The following examples show the possibilities of leaving out these verbal arguments:\n\nIntransitive clause with no subject noun phrase:\n\nIntransitive clause with subject noun phrase:\n\nTransitive clause with no overt arguments:\n\nTransitive clause with agent noun phrase:\n\nTransitive clause with patient noun phrase:\n\nThe Greenlandic language uses case to express grammatical relations between participants in a sentence. Nouns are inflected with one of the two core cases or one of the six oblique cases.\n\nGreenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, instead of treating the grammatical relations as in most European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation has shown that the use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.\n\nIntransitive:\n\nTransitive with agent and object:\n\nIn transitive clauses where both object and subject are expressed as free noun phrases, basic, pragmatically neutral word order is AOXV / SXV, where X is a noun phrase in one of the oblique cases. This order is fairly free, though. Topical noun phrases occur at the beginning of a clause whereas new or emphasized information generally come last. This is usually the verb, but it can also be a focal subject or object as well. In spoken language also \"afterthought\" material or clarifications may follow the verb, usually in a lowered pitch.\n\nOn the other hand, the noun phrase is characterized by a rigid order where the head of the phrase precedes any modifiers and the possessor precedes the possessum.\n\nIn copula clauses the order is usually Subject-Copula-Complement.\n\nAn attribute appears after its head noun.\n\nAn attribute of an incorporated noun appears after the verb:\n\nSyntactic coordination and subordination is done by combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context. The relative order of the main clause and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to pragmatic concerns.\n\nThe Greenlandic pronominal system includes a distinction known as obviation or switch-reference. There is a special so-called fourth person used to denote a third person subject of a subordinate verb or the possessor of a noun that is coreferent with the third person subject of the matrix clause. Below are examples of the difference between third and fourth person:\n\nThere is no category of definiteness in Greenlandic, so the information whether participants are already known to the listener or new in the discourse is encoded by other means. According to some authors, morphology related to transitivity such as the use of the construction sometimes called antipassive or intransitive object conveys such meaning, along with strategies of noun incorporation of non-topical noun phrases. This view, however, is controversial.\n\nActive:\n\nAntipassive/intransitive object:\n\nThe morphology of Greenlandic verbs is enormously complex. The two main processes are inflection and derivation. Inflectional morphology includes the processes of obligatory inflection for mood, person, and voice (tense/aspect is not an inflectional category in Kalaallisut). Derivational morphology modifies the meaning of verbs in a way similar to that expressed by adverbs in English. Derivational suffixes of this kind number in the hundreds. Many of these suffixes are so semantically salient that they are often referred to as postbases rather than suffixes, particularly in the American tradition of Eskimo grammar. Such semantically \"heavy\" suffixes may express concepts such as \"to have\", \"to be\", \"to say\", or \"to think\". The Greenlandic verb word consists of a root + derivational suffixes/postbases + inflectional suffixes. Tense and aspect is marked by optional suffixes that appear between the derivational and inflectional suffixes.\n\nGreenlandic verbs inflect for agreement with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four are used in independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.\n\nThe indicative mood is used in all independent expository clauses. The interrogative mood is used for posing questions. Questions with the question particle \"immaqa\" \"maybe\" cannot use the interrogative mood.\n\nTable 5 shows the intransitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb \"neri-\" \"to eat\" in the indicative and interrogative moods (question marks mark interrogative intonation—questions have falling intonation on the last syllable as opposed to most Indo-European languages in which questions are marked by rising intonation). The indicative and the interrogative mood each have a transitive and an intransitive inflection, but here only the intransitive inflection is given. Consonant gradation like that in Finnish appears to show up in the verb conjugation (with strengthening to \"pp\" in the 3rd person plural and weakening to \"v\" elsewhere).\n\nTable 6 shows the transitive indicative inflection for patient person and number of the verb \"asa-\" \"to love\" (an asterisk means that this form does not occur as such but would have to use a different reflexive inflection).\n\nThe imperative mood is used to issue orders. It is always combined with the second person. The optative is used to express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There is a negative imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, and one that is considered rude and is usually used to address children.\n\nThe conditional mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning \"if\" or \"when\".\n\nThe causative mood (sometimes called the \"conjunctive\") is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning \"because\", \"since\" or \"when\"; it is also sometimes used with the meaning of \"that\". The causative is also used in main clauses to imply some underlying cause.\n\nThe contemporative mood is used to construct subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if the subject of the subordinate clause and of the main clause are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative can also be used to form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.\n\nThe participial mood is used to construct a subordinate clause describing its subject in the state of carrying out an activity. It is used when the matrix clause and the subordinate clause have different subjects. It is often used in appositional phrases such as relative clauses.\n\nVerbal derivation is extremely productive, and Greenlandic employs many hundreds of derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words. Below are given some examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.\n\n-\"katap\"- \"be tired of\"\n\n-\"ler\"- \"begin to/be about to\"\n\n-\"llaqqip\"- \"be proficient at\"\n\n-\"niar\"- \"plans to/wants to\"\n\n-\"ngajap\"- \"almost\"\n\n-\"nikuu-nngila\"- \"has never\"\n\n-\"nngitsoor\"- \"not anyway/afterall\"\n\nGreenlandic grammar has morphological devices to mark a distinction between, for example, recent and distant past, but the use of these is not obligatory, and they should therefore rather be understood as parts of Greenlandic's extensive derivational system than as a system of tense markers. Rather than by morphological marking, fixed temporal distance is expressed by temporal adverbials:\n\nAll other things being equal and in the absence of any explicit adverbials, the indicative mood will be interpreted as complete or incomplete depending on the verbal aktionsart.\n\nBut if a sentence containing an atelic verbal phrase is embedded within the context of a past time narrative, it would be interpreted as past.\n\nGreenlandic has several purely derivational devices of expressing meaning related to aspect and aktionsart, e.g. \"sar\" expressing \"habituality\" and \"ssaar\" expressing \"stop to\". Next to these, there are at least two major perfect markers: \"sima\" and \"nikuu\". \"sima\" can occur in several positions with obviously different function Rightmost position indicates evidential meaning, but this can be determined only if a number of suffixes are present.\n\nWith atelic verbs, there is a regular contrast between indirective evidentiality marked by \"sima\" and witnessed evidentiality marked by \"nikuu\". Due to its evidential meaning, the combination of first person and \"sima\" sometimes is marked.\n\nIn the written language and more recently also in the spoken language especially of younger speakers, \"sima\" and \"nikuu\" can be used together with adverbials referring to a particular time in the past. That is, they might arguably mark time reference, but not yet systematically.\n\nJust as Greenlandic does not systematically mark past tense, the language also does not have a future tense. Rather, it employs three different strategies to express future meaning:\n\nWhile the status of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some scholars have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix \"-ssa\" and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers. However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics that can be used to refer to the future via the strategies just described.\n\nThere is also a debate in the linguistic literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This argument is supported by the fact that many of the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.\n\n\"qimmeq\" \"dog\" + \"-qar- \"have\" (+ \"-poq\" \"3p\")\n\n\"illu\" \"house\" + -'lior\"- \"make\"\n\n\"kaffi\" \"coffee\" + -\"sor\"- \"drink/eat\"\n\n\"puisi\" \"seal\" + -\"nniar\"- \"hunt\"\n\n\"allagaq\" \"letter\" + -\"si\"- \"receive\"\n\n\"anaana\" \"mother\" + -\"a\"- \"to be\"\n\nNouns are obligatorily inflected for case and number and optionally for number and person of possessor. Singular and plural are distinguished and 8 cases used: absolutive, ergative (relative), instrumental, allative, locative, ablative, prosecutive (also called vialis or prolative), and equative. Case and number are marked by a single suffix. Nouns can be derived from verbs or from other nouns by a number of suffixes, e.g. \"atuar\"- \"to read\" + -\"fik\" \"place\" becomes \"atuarfik\" \"school\" and \"atuarfik\" + -\"tsialak\" \"something good\" becomes \"atuarfitsialak\" \"good school\".\n\nThe fact that the possessive agreement suffixes on nouns and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs in a number of instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between transitive and intransitive nouns, parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.\n\nThere are personal pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and plural. These pronouns are optional as subjects or objects, but only when the verbal inflection refers to such arguments.\n\nPersonal pronouns are, however, necessary in the oblique case:\n\nThe two grammatical core cases ergative and absolutive are used to express grammatical and syntactical roles of participant noun phrases. The oblique cases express information related to movement and manner.\n\nThe instrumental case is versatile. It is used for the instrument with which an action is carried out, for oblique objects of intransitive verbs (also called antipassive verbs) and for secondary objects of transitive verbs.\n\nIt is also used to express the meaning of \"give me\" and for forming adverbs from nouns:\n\nThe allative case describes movement towards something.\n\nIt is also used with numerals and the question word \"qassit\" to express the time of the clock, and in the meaning \"amount per unit\":\n\nThe locative case describes spatial location:\n\nThe ablative case describes movement away from something or the source of something:\n\nThe prosecutive case describes movement through something as well as the medium of writing or a location on the body. It is also used to describe a group of people such as a family as belonging to the modified noun.\n\nThe equative case describes similarity of manner or quality. It is also used for deriving language names from nouns denoting nationalities, i.e. \"like a person of x nationality [speaks]\".\n\nIn Greenlandic possession is marked on the noun which agrees with the person and number of its possessor. The possessor is in the ergative case. There are different possessive paradigms for all of the different cases. Table 4 gives the possessive paradigm for the absolutive case of \"illu\" \"house\". Below are given examples of the use of the possessive inflection, the use of the ergative case for possessors and the use of fourth person possessors.\n\nGreenlandic vocabulary is mostly inherited from Proto-Eskimo–Aleut, but it has also taken a large number of loans from other languages, especially from Danish. Early loans from Danish have often become acculturated to the Greenlandic phonological system, for example the Greenlandic word \"palasi\" \"priest\" is a loan from the Danish \"præst\". But since Greenlandic has an enormous potential for the derivation of new words from existing roots, many modern concepts have Greenlandic names that have been invented rather than borrowed, e.g. \"qarasaasiaq\" \"computer\" which literally means \"artificial brain\". This potential for complex derivations also means that Greenlandic vocabulary is built on very few roots which combined with affixes come to form large word families. For example the root for \"tongue\" \"oqaq\" is used to derive the following words:\n\n\nLexical differences between dialects are often considerable. This is due to the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several times because of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.\n\nGreenlandic is written with the Latin script. The alphabet:\nTo spell loanwords from other languages, especially from Danish and English, the additional letters \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"X\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"W\", \"Æ\", \"Ø\" and \"Å\" are used. Greenlandic uses the symbols \"...\" and »...« as quotation marks.\n\nFrom 1851 until 1973, Greenlandic was written in the alphabet invented by Samuel Kleinschmidt. This alphabet employed the special character \"kra\" (Κʼ / ĸ) which was replaced by q in the 1973 reform. In the Kleinschmidt alphabet, long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by means of diacritics on the vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name \"Kalaallit Nunaat\" was spelled \"Kalâdlit Nunât\". This scheme uses a circumflex accent ( ˆ ) to indicate a long vowel (\"e.g.\", \"ât/ît/ût\", modern: \"aat\", \"iit\", \"uut\"), an acute accent ( ´ ) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (\"i.e.\", \"á\", \"í\", \"ú\" modern: \"a(kk)\", \"i(kk)\", \"u(kk)\")] and, finally, a tilde ( ˜ ) or a grave accent ( ` ), depending on the author, indicates vowel length \"and\" gemination of the following consonant (\"e.g.\", \"ãt\", \"ĩt\", \"ũt\" or \"àt\", \"ìt\", \"ùt\", modern: \"aatt\", \"iitt\", \"uutt\"). The letters \"ê\" and \"ô\", used only before \"r\" and \"q\", are now written \"ee\" and \"oo\" in Greenlandic. The spelling system of Nunatsiavummiutut, spoken in Nunatsiavut in northeastern Labrador, is derived from the old Greenlandic system.\n\nTechnically, the Kleinschmidt orthography focused upon morphology: the same derivational affix would be written in the same way in different contexts, despite its being pronounced differently in different contexts. The 1973 reform replaced this with a phonological system: Here, there was a clear link from written form to pronunciation, and the same suffix is now written differently in different contexts. The differences are due to phonological changes. It is therefore easy to go from the old orthography to the new (cf. the online converter) whereas going the other direction would require a full lexical analysis.\n\n\"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\" (Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights)\n\n\n\n"}

The Indonesian Wikipedia is the fifth-fastest-growing Wikipedia in an Asian language after the Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Turkish language Wikipedias.\nIts first article was written on May 30, 2003, yet its Main Page was created six months later on November 29, 2003.\n\nThere are articles in the Indonesian Wikipedia. In April 2016, there were 462 editors who made at least five edits in that month.\n\nAlthough the Indonesian language is similar to the Malay language, the Indonesian Wikipedia remains separate from the Malay Wikipedia (initiated on October 2002). The Indonesian and Malay Wikipedias were started separately by two different user groups within six months of each other. In 2009, Andrew Lih wrote \"Because these groups are drawn on national boundaries, merging is not likely to happen soon.\"\n\nIndonesian is a normative form of the Malay language, an Austronesian (or Malayo-Polynesian) language which had been used as a lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for centuries, and was elevated to the status of an official language with the Indonesian Declaration of Independence in 1945, drawing inspiration from the Sumpah Pemuda (Youth Pledge) event in 1928. It is very similar to the official Malaysian form of the language. However, it does differ from the Malaysian form in some ways, with key differences in pronunciation and vocabulary, due in large part to the many Dutch words in the Indonesian vocabulary. It is spoken as a mother tongue by only 7% of the population of Indonesia, but altogether more than 200 million people speak it. The Malay language is spoken by ethnic groups who reside in the Malay Peninsula, southern Thailand, parts of the Philippines, and Singapore. Malay is also considered one of the dialects of the Indonesian language by Indonesians living in central eastern Sumatra, the Riau Islands and parts of the coast of Borneo.\n\nIn 2004, \"Tempo\" magazine published a feature about the Indonesian Wikipedia, in which Revo Soekatno, one of its best known contributors, described it as the \"Encyclopedia from the boarding houses\", meaning an encyclopedia that was produced by Indonesians living and studying overseas. The article contributed to the popularization of Wikipedia in the archipelago and since then, the Indonesian Wikipedia has seen its number of users rise remarkably.\n\nIn 2006, following \"Time\" featuring \"You\" as its person of the year, \"Kompas\" published a on Revo where he was called the \"Father of Wikipedia in Indonesian\". The article highlighted the spirit of participation as the type of \"addiction to the cyberspace that needed to be endorsed\". Other Indonesian publications followed suit to refer to Revo Soekatno as an \"activist that built a community portal in Indonesia\" praising his contributions to the presence of Indonesia in the Internet.\n\nIn February 2009, the Indonesian Wikipedia achieved the milestone of 100,000 articles. One of the contributors mentioned in the article was the user borgx, who made 80,000 edits starting in 2005. That year, the Indonesian Wikipedia had only fifty active contributors.\n\nIn March 2007, Bina Nusantara University invited Indonesian Wikipedians to speak at the first Wikipedia seminar for the public and to introduce Wikipedia Bahasa Indonesia and Wikimedia Foundation projects at its campus in Jakarta.\n\nIn November 2007, the Indonesian Government, through its Department of Communication and Information, decided to establish an annual Indonesian ICT Award and invited the Indonesian Wikipedia Community to hold a workshop on how to write Wikipedia articles. Ivan Lanin, one of the speakers interviewed by Antara, stated that the number of contributors to the Indonesian Wikipedia was rising, and the articles were beginning to become more diverse. According to Revo's speech, the challenge for the Indonesian Wikipedia in the future was to gain credibility and give the public assurance about the quality of the content provided.\n\nThe first day of the workshop was attended by 40 people, although the number of computers provided for hands-on practice was considerably less than the number of participants.\n\nThe following year, at the 2008 Indonesian ICT Awards, the Indonesian Wikipedia Community held separate workshop sessions for the public and for organizations.\n\nIn August 2008, the Indonesian version of \"CHIP\" magazine distributed a complimentary DVD containing more than 80,000 articles (without images) with its 11th anniversary edition. This edition also featured a three-page Wikipedia article titled \"Wikipedia: When one thousand brains are better than one\". The article provided an extensive history of Wikipedia, including the Indonesian Wikipedia, as well as a description of the Wikimedia Indonesia chapter, which was in preparation at that time.\n\nHowever, a DVD version of the Indonesian Wikipedia with photos was already in existence since April 2008 and could be purchased online from an independent vendor for 20 thousand rupiah, around US$2.\n\n\nThese are Wikipedias written in local Indonesian languages.

Compared with the forerunner book, the 1979 edition was expanded, and the material was reworked to make it more accessible to students, cf. (Hopcroft 1989).\nThis gearing towards understandability at the price of succinctness was not seen positive by all. As Hopcroft reports on feedback to the overhauled 1979 edition: \"It seems that our attempts to lower the level of our presentation for the benefit of students by including more detail and explanations had an adverse effect on the faculty, who then had to sift through the added material to outline and prepare their lectures\" (Hopcroft 1989).\n\nStill, the most cited edition of the book is apparently the 1979 edition: According to the website CiteSeerX, \nover 3000 scientific papers freely available online cite this edition of the book (CiteSeerX, 2009).\n\n\n\n"}

The speakers of Jarai number approximately 262,800 without counting other possible Jarai communities in countries different to Vietnam and Cambodia such as United States of America. They are the largest of the upland ethnic groups of Vietnam's Central Highlands known as Degar or Montagnards and the 25% of the population in the Cambodian province of Ratanakiri.\n\nThe language is in the Chamic subgroup of the Malayo-Polynesian languages, and is thus related to the Cham language of central Vietnam.\n\nA number of Jarai also live in the United States, having resettled there following the Vietnam War.\n\nThe Jarai language has been classified since 1864 as a Western Malayo-Polynesian Malayic, Achinese-Chamic, Chamic, South, Plateau identified by M. Fontaine as related to the languages of the Thiames (Chams) and Rade of the ancient kingdom of Champa, today the province of Annam.\n\nJarai is spoken by some 262,800 people in Cambodia and Vietnam (Simons, 2017) where it is recognized as an official minority language, although in Cambodia it has not its own writing in the Khmer scripts.

Đào Huy Quyền (1998) lists the following subgroups of Jarai dialects and their respective locations.\n\n\nOther related groups include:\n\n\nInfluenced by the surrounding Mon–Khmer languages, words of the various Chamic languages of Southeast Asia, including Jarai, have become disyllabic with the stress on the second syllable. Additionally, Jarai has further evolved in the pattern of Mon–Khmer, losing almost all vowel distinction in the initial syllable. While trisyllabic words do exist, they are all loanwords. The typical Jarai word may be represented:\n\nwhere the values in parentheses are optional and \"(C)\" in the cluster \"C(C)\" represents a liquid consonant or a semivowel . In Jarai dialects spoken in Cambodia, the \"(C)\" in the cluster \"C(C)\" can also be the voiced velar fricative , a phoneme used by the Jarai in Cambodia, but not attested in Vietnam. The vowel of the first syllable in disyllabic words is most often the mid-central unrounded vowel, , unless the initial consonant is the glottal stop . The second vowel of the stressed syllable produces a diphthong.\n\nDuring the French Indochina, they introduced a Jarai alphabet using the Vietnamese alphabet at the beginning of the 20th century. With the introduction of the Bible in Jarai language, using that alphabet by Christian missionaries in Vietnam after the Vietnamese War, the Jarai increased their literacy and there are today many publications for the Vietnamese Jarai.

It is an official language of Tripura, a small state of India.\n\nThe principal structures of affirmative sentences in Kokborok are the following:\n\nIn Kokborok grammar use of the notion of 'person' is almost absent; the form of verb is same for one who speaks, one who is spoken to, and one who is spoken about.\n\nIn Kokborok there are two numbers: Singular and plural. The plural marker is used at the end of the noun or pronoun. There are two plural markers: \"rok\" and \"song\". \"Rok\" is universally used while \"song\" is used with human nouns only.\nThe plural marker is normally used at the end of the noun or pronoun. But when the noun has an adjective the plural marker is used at the end of the adjective instead of the noun.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nIn Kokborok there are four genders: masculine gender, feminine gender, common gender, and neuter gender. Words which denote male are masculine, words which denote female are feminine, words which can be both male and female are common gender, and words which cannot be either masculine or feminine and neuter gender.\n\nThere are various ways to change genders of words:\n\nIn Kokborok there are the nominative, accusative, instrumental, ablative, locative and possessive cases.\n\nThese case suffixes are used at the end of the noun/pronoun and there is no change in the form of the noun.\n\nIn Kokborok the adjectives come after the words they qualify. This rule is strictly followed only in the case of native adjectives. In case of loan adjectives the rule is rather loose. Kokborok adjectives may be divided into four classes:\n\n\nThe first three classes may include both native and loan words.

Advancing units fire their weapons without stopping to aim, in an attempt to pin down enemy defenders. Marching fire usually ends with an infantry charge to engage the enemy in close combat. The tactic requires ample ammunition and rapid-fire weapons. It differs from fire and movement in that the attacking force advances in unison rather than leapfrogging forward in alternating groups.\n\nAn early form of marching fire was used with little success by Prussian troops at the end of the 18th century, then victoriously in the 1866 Battle of Königgrätz because of the fast-firing Dreyse needle gun. The modern form of marching fire evolved in the early 20th century from a French Army infantry assault concept which suggested the use of suppressive fire from a light machine gun carried by one man—the Chauchat automatic rifle. The tactic was employed to a limited degree in World War I then further codified with the introduction of the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle and described in U.S. small unit infantry tactics manuals in the early 1920s. As a combined arms stratagem, the tactic was prominently advocated and utilized by General George S. Patton in World War II during his command of the Third Army.\n\nInfantry alone may be insufficient to suppress a well-positioned, well-armed and resolute enemy, especially during the final charge phase. To augment marching fire, supporting forces including heavy weapons teams and armored units may be halted in static positions to maintain suppressive fire throughout the final charge of friendly troops.\n\nThe French military tactician Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, wrote dismissively about a Prussian tactic he called \"marching fire\". In the late 18th century he witnessed a Prussian Army maneuver in which advancing troops formed themselves into a battle line of two ranks. In alternating fashion, one rank fired their weapons at a slow march while the other group reloaded then advanced on the double. The Prussians called this tactic \"fire in advancing\" (\"Feuer im Vormarsch\") and trained in it at the level of platoon, company and battalion. Guibert considered it \"ill advised\", with the line's progress across the field seen as too slow, exposing the troops for too long to defensive fire.\nThe first successful employment of marching fire may be traced to the fast-firing Dreyse needle gun used by Prussian troops in the mid-19th century. This new breech-loading gun was 2–3 times faster than contemporary muzzle-loading guns, and its lightweight cartridge allowed the infantryman to carry more ammunition. A major disadvantage was that escaping hot gases from the breech would strike the face of any trooper who took careful aim. Accordingly, the weapon was often fired while being held away from the face with the result that marksmanship was inferior. In 1866, Prussians were successful in advancing quickly while firing their needle guns in the Battle of Königgrätz; the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War. Soon, though, the increased use of rapid-fire guns by defending troops neutralized the advantage.\n\nIn 1903, French military theorists noticed that the machine guns of the day, heavy and relatively immobile, were of little use in infantry assaults. They determined that \"the machine gun must learn to walk\". A marching fire tactic (French: \"feu de marche\") was expected to involve incidental suppressive fire, with the advancing troops considered a deadlier threat than the unaimed bullets, causing the enemy to fall back. The prototype guns were not approved for production, and none were in service when World War I began. At the start of hostilities, France quickly turned an existing prototype ( the \"CS\" for Chauchat and Sutter ) into the lightweight Chauchat M1915 automatic rifle with a high rate of fire. The French Army was equipped with it, and the first American units to arrive in France used it in 1917 and 1918. Hastily mass manufactured under desperate wartime pressures, the weapon was prone to jamming and overheating. Seeing the potential of such a gun, the British Army settled upon the American-designed Lewis gun fitted for a round; infantry platoons provided with the guns were instructed in fire and movement tactics. Soon, the gun was seen to be useful in marching fire assaults, notably by the Australian Corps in the July 1918 Battle of Hamel. To serve the same purpose, the German Army adopted the MG08/15 which was impractically heavy at counting the water for cooling and one magazine holding 100 rounds.\n\nIn 1918 the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) was introduced in the US Army, and with the weapon came new field tactics including marching fire. The BAR's shoulder sling was to be adjusted in length to allow the butt of the weapon to be held firmly at the side of the torso just above the hips, with one hand at the trigger and the other hand aiming. A recommended rate of fire was one round per footstep, with eyes kept on the target and the weapon aimed low at first. The tactic was to be employed under conditions of limited field of fire and poor visibility such as advancing through woods. That same year the U.S. Navy instructed its landing forces (usually Marines) that marching fire with a BAR was to be used in very limited circumstances, such as when the enemy line was clearly defined and the range was less than . Marching fire was not usually employed in the open and was more appropriate in dense woods. The Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) handbook of 1921 included a description of marching fire as an assault tactic in which the BAR men walk and shoot from the hip with the weapon's weight supported on a shoulder sling, but the accompanying riflemen were expected to halt and carefully aim each of their shots, firing from the shoulder, from a standing or kneeling position.\n\nThe psychological value of marching fire was quickly recognized. Marching fire was seen as a boost to the morale of the assault troops. It was hoped that enemy troops would lose courage if they heard bullets flying around them, if they believed that their position was known to the attackers.\n\nThe tactic of marching fire was praised by General George S. Patton for three reasons: friendly forces using the tactic continued to advance rather than get bogged down, the positive action of shooting provided self-confidence to the soldier, and the enemy's defensive fire was reduced in accuracy, volume and effectiveness. Patton recommended that the rifleman carrying \"that magnificent weapon\", the M1 Garand rifle, should fire his weapon every two or three paces, holding the weapon at his shoulder if desired, but a lower position between the belt and armpit was \"just as effective\". Patton advised his 81 mm M1 mortar teams to stay in one place during the assault and apply steady fire, but his smaller 60 mm M2 mortars should alternately fire and leapfrog forward. Light machine guns could be simultaneously carried and fired by one man while another man fed the ammo belt. Patton wrote that the main purpose of the tank was to attack infantry in defensive positions rather than other tanks. He instructed his tanks and other armored units to advance with marching fire in support of the infantry.\nGeneral William E. DePuy, who rose from junior staff officer to battalion commander in the 90th Infantry Division between 1942 and 1945, evaluated the efficacy of unsupported marching fire and found it lacking. Writing after the war, DePuy said that marching fire became a fad, in some American units almost the sole form of attack. DePuy noted that when it was employed against Germans who were \"well hidden and in very good positions\"—as they usually were—the attackers walked into the enemy's kill zone. DePuy said that if maneuvering infantry alone performed marching fire, the moment when enemy suppression was most needed it would cease during the final charge at which time \"the enemy then comes up out of his foxholes and starts to fire at you.\" DePuy asserted that suppression gained by fire from non-moving units was critical to the success of marching fire. Such units could be as large as rifle companies or as small as squads equipped with heavy and light machine guns.\n"}

Children with this disorder have difficulty understanding words and sentences. This impairment is classified by deficiencies in expressive and receptive language development that is not attributed to sensory deficits, nonverbal intellectual deficits, a neurological condition, environmental deprivation or psychiatric impairments. Research illustrates that 2% to 4% of 5 year olds have mixed receptive-expressive language disorder. This distinction is made when children have issues in expressive language skills, the production of language, and when children also have issues in receptive language skills, the understanding of language. Those with mixed receptive-language disorder have a normal left-right anatomical asymmetry of the planum temporale and parietale. This is attributed to a reduced left hemisphere functional specialization for language. Taken from a measure of cerebral blood flow (SPECT) in phonemic discrimination tasks, children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder do not exhibit the expected predominant left hemisphere activation. Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder is also known as receptive-expressive language impairment (RELI) or receptive language disorder. \n\nIf assessed on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, for instance, symptoms of mixed receptive-expressive language disorder may show as relatively low scores for Information, Vocabulary and Comprehension (perhaps below the 25th percentile). If a person has difficulty with specific types of concepts, for example spatial terms, such as 'over', 'under', 'here' and 'there', they may also have difficulties with arithmetic, understanding word problems and instructions, or difficulties using words at all.\nThey may also have a more general problem with words or sentences, both comprehension and orally. Some children will have issues with pragmatics - the use of language in social contexts as well; and therefore, will have difficulty with inferring meaning. Furthermore, they have severe impairment of spontaneous language production and for this reason, they have difficulty in formulating questions. Generally, children will have trouble with morphosyntax, which is word inflections. These children have difficulty understanding and applying grammatical rules, such as endings that mark verb tenses (e.g. -\"ed\"), third-person singular verbs (e.g. I \"think\", he \"thinks\"), plurals (e.g. -\"s\"), auxiliary verbs that denote tenses (e.g. \"was\" running, \"is\" running), and with determiners (\"the, a\"). Moreover, children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorders have deficits in completing two cognitive operations at the same time and learning new words or morphemes under time pressure or when processing demands are high. These children also have auditory processing deficits in which they process auditory information at a slower rate and as a result, require more time for processing.\n\nStudies show that low receptive and expressive language at young ages was correlated to increased autism symptom severity in children in their early school years. Below is a chart depicting language deficits of children on the Autistic Spectrum. This table indicates the lower levels of language processing, receptive/expressive disorders, which is more severe in children with autism. When autistic children speak, they are often difficult to understand, their language is sparse and dysfluent, they speak in single, uninflected words or short phrases, and their supply of words is severely depleted. This leads to limited vocabulary while also having deficits in verbal short term memory.\n\nChildren who demonstrate deficiencies early in their speech and language development are at risk for continued speech and language issues throughout later childhood. Similarly, even if these speech and language problems have been resolved, children with early language delay are more at risk for difficulties in phonological awareness, reading, and writing throughout their lives. Children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder are often likely to have long-term implications for language development, literacy, behavior, social development, and even mental health problems. If suspected of having a mixed receptive-expressive language disorder, treatment is available from a speech therapist or pathologist. Most treatments are short term, and rely upon accommodations made within the environment, in order to minimize interfering with work or school. Programs that involve intervention planning that link verbal short term memory with visual/non-verbal information may be helpful for these children. In addition, approaches such as parent training for language stimulation and monitoring language through the \"watch and see\" method are recommended. The watch-and-see technique advises children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder who come from stable, middle-class homes without any other behavioral, medical, or hearing problems should be vigilantly monitored rather than receive intervention. It is often the case that children do not meet the eligibility criteria established through a comprehensive oral language evaluation; and as a result, are not best suited for early intervention programs and require a different approach besides the \"one size fits all\" model.\n\n\n"}

She later taught Latin through Irish at Ballingeary and became proficient in French, German, Italian and Spanish.\n\nShe spent the last £100 of her scholarship on a dowry for her marriage to Sean MacGearailt, later first Accountant General of Revenue in the Irish civil service, with whom she lived originally in Glasnevin and then in Dalkey.\n\nShe was a founder member of the radical Craobh an Chéitinnigh, the Keating branch of the Gaelic League (Conradh na Gaelige), composed mainly of Dublin-based Kerry people and regarded, by themselves at least, as the intellectual focus of the League.\n\nIn August 1904, some six years after the establishment of the earliest women's hurling teams, the rules of camogie (then called \"camoguidheacht\"), first appeared in \"Banba\", a journal produced by Craobh an Chéitinnigh. Camogie had come to public attention when it was showcased at the annual Oireachtas (Gaelic League Festival) earlier that year, and it differed from men's hurling in its use of a lighter ball and a smaller playing-field. Máire Ní Chinnéide and Cáit Ní Dhonnchadha (like Ní Chinnéide, an Irish-language enthusiast and cultural nationalist), were credited with having created the game, with the assistance of Ní Dhonnchadha's scholarly brother Tadhg Ó Donnchadha, who drew up its rules. She was on the first camogie team to play an exhibition match in Navan in July 1904, became an early propagandist for the game and, in 1905 was elected president of the infant Camogie Association. She wrote:\n\n\"all existing games were passed in review, but it was felt from the first that Hurling was the model on which the new game should be formed.” Initial matches were played on the grounds of Mr O’Dowd in Drumcondra Park, but “the place was not very suitable and players did not join in any numbers until the Keating Camoguidhthe betook themselves to the Phoenix Park, where they have a convenient ground well off the main road.\"\n\nShe later served as Vice-President of Craobh an Chéitinnigh, to Cathal Brugha. She was active in Cumann na mBan during the Irish War of Independence and took the pro-treaty side during the civil war and attempted to set up a woman's organisation \"in support of the Free State\" alongside Jennie Wyse Power.\n\nShe first visited the Blasket Islands in 1932 with her daughter Niamh, who was to die tragically young. In the summer of 1934 Máire Bean Nic Gearailt as she was then, who had known Peig Sayers, put the idea into the old woman's head to write a memoir. According to a later interview with Ní Chinnéide\n\nPeig answered that she had \"nothing to write.\" She had learned only to read and write in English at school and most of it was forgotten.\n\nMáire Ní Chinnéide suggested Peig should dictate her memoir to her son Micheal, known to everyone on the island as An File (\"The Poet\"), but Peig \"only shook her head doubtfully.\" At Christmas a packet arrived from the Blaskets with a manuscript, Máire transcribed it word for word and in summer brought it back to the Blaskets to read it to Peig.\n\nShe then edited the manuscript for the Talbot Press. Peig became well known as a prescribed text on the Leaving Certificate curriculum in Irish.\n\nMáire had an acting part in the first modern play performed in Irish on the stage, \"Casadh an tSugáin\" by Douglas Hyde in 1901. She was later author of children's plays staged by An Comhar Drámuidhachta at the Oireachtas and the Peacock Theatre, of which \"Gleann na Sidheóg\" and \"An Dúthchas\" (1908) were published. She was a broadcaster in Irish on 2RN/Raidio Éireann after its foundation in 1926 and author of a translation of Grimms' Fairy Tales (1923). She was president of the Gaelic Players Dramatic group during the 1930s and a founder of the Gaelic Writers Association in 1939.\n\nNí Chinnéide soon became interested in writing children's plays, including \"Gleann na Sidheóg\" [Fairy Glen] (1905) and \"Sidheoga na mBláth\" [Flower Fairies] (1909). Although there is little information available on the staging of Ní Chinnéide's first play, by the time her second children's play, \"Sidheóga na mBláth,\" was published in \"An Claidheamh Soluis\" in December 1907, \"Éire Óg\" [\"Young Ireland\"] branches of the Gaelic League had been established in conjunction with adults' branches. P.H. Pearse in particular voiced the expectation that this play would be staged by many \"Éire Óg\" branches \"before the New Year is very old,\" thus indicating the immediate take up of such plays. Indeed, a week after the play's publication, it was staged in the Dominican College in Donnybrook, Dublin, where Ní Chinnéide had spent several years as an Irish teacher.\n\nShe died on 25 April 1967 and is buried in Deans Grange Cemetery.\n\nIn 2007 the camogie trophy for the annual inter-county All Ireland Championship for counties graded Junior B was named in her honour.\n\n\n"}

Marie language resolution was a government motion passed on January 29, 1990 by Sault Ste. Marie City Council, the governing body of the city of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, which resolved that English was the sole working language of city government. The resolution ignited a national controversy which made the city a flashpoint in the Meech Lake Accord debate.\n\nThe Sault Ste. Marie resolution was not the first of its kind in Ontario, but Sault Ste. Marie was the largest municipality to pass such a resolution and bore the brunt of the controversy.\n\nThe resolution was struck down by a court ruling in 1994, and ceased to have legal effect.\n\nIn 2010, John Rowswell, a subsequent mayor of Sault Ste. Marie, apologized to French Canadians across the country for the resolution.\n\nSault Ste. Marie was founded by French-speaking missionaries in 1623 but had become overwhelmingly English-speaking by the twentieth century.\n\nIn response to a French-language education controversy which began in 1987 when a group of Franco-Ontarian families lobbied to have a new French school opened in the city, the Sault Alliance for the Preservation of English Language Rights (SAPELR) was formed and began circulating petitions to have this resolution passed by council. The group worked in concert with the Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada (APEC), a lobby group which was concurrently campaigning against the provincial government's French Language Services Act. Although that law dealt only with provincial government services, APEC's strategy was to convince municipalities that they would be required to provide services in French, regardless of cost or benefit, in an attempt to convince the municipalities to pass this type of resolution. As a result of the schooling controversy, the SAPELR petition quickly garnered over 25,000 signatures.\n\nThe resolution was widely seen as retaliation for Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa's move to override the Supreme Court of Canada ruling that declared parts of Bill 101 unconstitutional. Bill 101 had declared French as the only official language of Quebec.\n\n\"Whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie is composed of many different ethnic groups, languages and cultures;\"\n\n\"And whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie has always shown respect for each of these cultures by providing preferential treatment for none;\"\n\n\"And whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie has throughout its history had one common working language for all of its written and oral communications, which is English;\"\n\n\"And whereas the preferred common language of commerce, business, trade, science and normal everyday activities is English;\"\n\n\"Now therefore be it resolved that the Corporation of the City of Sault Ste. Marie in the interests of maintaining goodwill, harmony and sound and responsible fiscal management continue as it has in the past to accept the use of English as the official language of communication with its citizens and with all levels of government, thereby demonstrating the concept of equality for each ethnic, cultural and language group in its jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"And further resolved in accordance with the Provisions of the Municipal Act of Ontario Part VII and more specifically Section 104a of Said Act the Council of the Corporation of the City of Sault Ste. Marie declares English to be the official language of the said Corporation.\"\n\nOn January 27, 1990, the city's daily newspaper, the \"Sault Star\", reported that council would debate the language resolution two days later. This triggered the attention of the national media, and with reporters from all across Canada in town to cover the debate, the resolution passed council 11-2.\n\nMany political figures, including Brian Mulroney, Jean Chrétien and Ontario premier David Peterson, who had strongly condemned Premier Bourassa's use of the notwithstanding clause, expressed their opposition to the city's move. Both Peterson and his successor as premier, Bob Rae, refused to meet with mayor Joe Fratesi on several subsequent occasions, even to discuss unrelated matters.\n\nIn particular, the resolution was seen as a slap in the face to Quebec, where it was widely viewed as racist. (One Environment Canada meteorologist sent out a weather report for Sault Ste. Marie in which the forecast called for \"a chance of flurries and Nazis\", leading to her suspension.) Council defended the resolution, suggesting that Quebec's language laws and its refusal to abide by the Supreme Court ruling also constituted racism.\n\nCouncil was also criticized for seemingly turning its back on the city's own history; although in modern times francophones are only a small percentage of the city's population, the city's history is intimately connected to early French Canadian missionary and voyageur exploration of the Great Lakes area. Some commentators also jokingly suggested that the resolution would require the city to change its name to St. Mary's Falls.\n\nEntertainers weighed in on the controversy; on their 1991 album \"Road Apples\", The Tragically Hip criticized the resolution in the song \"Born in the Water\":\n\n\"Smart as trees in Sault Ste. Marie<br>\n\"I can speak my mother tongue<br> \n\"Passing laws, just because<br> \n\"And singing songs of the English unsung<br>\n\"How could you do it?<br> \n\"How could you even try?<br>\n\"When you were born in the water<br> \n\"And you were raised up in the sky?\n\nFratesi, who was viewed by Sault Ste. Marie voters throughout the controversy as standing up for the city's interests, was re-elected mayor in a landslide in 1991. He later became embroiled in a conflict of interest controversy in 1995 when he applied for the job of chief administrative officer of the city, while still sitting as mayor.\n\nQuebec Premier Bourassa later passed Bill 86, which amended that province's language laws in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling, so the controversy died down.\n\nOn June 30, 1994, a court ruling struck down the English-only resolution as \"ultra vires\" the council's authority. On August 9, 1999, a resolution was brought forward under a new city council to strike down the resolution. The city's solicitor advised that the resolution was out of order given that a court had already struck down the resolution. Attempting to do what it could, the council then unanimously passed the following resolution:\n\n\"Moved by Councillor Derik Brandt\"<br>\n\"Seconded by Councillor Sam Lepore\"<br> \n\"Whereas the \"language resolution\" was struck down by the courts because it was beyond the City’s authority; and<br> \n\"Whereas it is not legally possible to rescind a resolution that has already been struck down by the courts;<br>\n\"Be It Resolved that a notation be added to the Minutes of the Regular Meeting of City Council of January 29, 1990 to include the following beside item 5(e); N.B. \"This resolution was struck down by the courts on June 30, 1994 and therefore has no effect.\"\"\n\nThe effect of the resolution was to amend the minutes containing the English-only resolution to note that the resolution had been struck down.\n\nAs recently as 2007, \"The Gazette\" in Montreal referred to the town of Hérouxville, then embroiled in a controversy around reasonable accommodation of immigrants, as Quebec's \"own Sault Ste. Marie\".\n\nOn January 28, 2010, 20 years less a day after the original resolution was passed, then-Sault Ste. Marie Mayor John Rowswell apologized to French-Canadians across the country for the resolution of the prior council.\n"}

{"id": "36017068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36017068", "title": "Telephone density", "text": "Telephone density\n\nTelephone density or teledensity is the number of telephone connections for every hundred individuals living within an area. It varies widely across the nations and also between urban and rural areas within a country. Telephone density has significant correlation with the per capita GDP of the area. It is also used as an indicator of the purchasing power of the middle class of the country or specific region.\n\nIn earlier days teledensity was computed as the number of fixed telephone lines per hundred inhabitants. But this method has become less significant with an increasing number of countries register a trend of mobile cellular subscribers outnumbering the fixed line connections. Hence, as an alternative, \"mobidensity\" or mobile cellular subscribers per hundred inhabitants was proposed. Since this method caused disadvantage to some countries where the fixed line network is well established, or others where the mobile network is still in its initial stage of development, \"effective teledensity\" has been proposed by ITU as the solution, which is defined as either fixed line connections or mobile subscribers per hundred inhabitants – whichever is higher.\n\nFixed telephone lines per hundred inhabitants is calculated by dividing the number of fixed telephone lines by the total population and then multiplying by 100. Fixed telephone lines include PSTN, WLL, ISDN and DSL. A single ISDN or DSL subscriber connection may cater to multiple voice channels. This leads to a lack of global standard in the computation of fixed line density and hence ITU has recommended that all the countries shall provide the methodology of calculation of this figure in order to enhance comparability.\n\nMobidensity or mobile cellular subscribers per hundred inhabitants is obtained by dividing the number of mobile cellular subscribers by the population and multiplying by 100. While computing Mobile cellular subscribers users of both post-paid subscriptions and pre-paid accounts are included. Inactive prepaid connections where a call has not been made or received within the last 3 months, are excluded.\n\nThe correlation between teledensity and per capita GDP could be represented by a straight line in a logarithmic graph. This relation was first mentioned by A.G.W. Jipp. a German engineer, in his book published in 1962. The graph is helpful to compare the telephone infrastructure development of different countries or regions, on the basis of teledensity.\n"}

{"id": "436363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436363", "title": "Weasel word", "text": "Weasel word\n\nA weasel word, or anonymous authority, is an informal term for words and phrases such as \"researchers believe\" and \"most people think\" which make arguments appear specific or meaningful, even though these terms are at best ambiguous and vague. Using weasel words may allow someone to later deny any specific meaning if the statement is challenged, because the statement was never specific in the first place. Weasel words can be a form of tergiversation, and may be used in advertising and political statements to mislead.\n\nWeasel words can soften or under-state a biased or otherwise controversial statement. An example of this is using terms like \"somewhat\" or \"in most respects,\" which make a sentence more ambiguous than it would be without them.\n\nThe expression \"weasel word\" may derive from the egg-eating habits of weasels. An article published by the \"Buffalo News\" attributes the origin of the term to William Shakespeare's plays \"Henry V\" and \"As You Like It\", in which the author includes similes of weasels sucking eggs. The article said that this was a misnomer, because weasels do not have a mandible suitable for sucking eggs.\n\nOvid's \"Metamorphoses\" provides an earlier source for the same etymology. Ovid describes how Juno orders the goddess of childbirth, Lucina, to prevent Alcmene from giving birth to Hercules. Alcmene's servant Galanthis, realizing that Lucina is outside the room using magic to prevent the birth, emerges to announce that the birth has been a success. Lucina, in her amazement, drops the spells of binding and Hercules is born. Galanthis then mocks Lucina, who responds by transforming her into a weasel. Ovid writes (in A.S. Kline's translation) \"And because her lying mouth helped in childbirth, she [as a weasel] gives birth through her mouth.\"\n\nDefinitions of the word 'weasel' that imply deception and irresponsibility include: the noun form, referring to a sneaky, untrustworthy, or insincere person; the verb form, meaning to manipulate shiftily; and the phrase \"to \"weasel out\"\", meaning \"to squeeze one's way out of something\" or \"to evade responsibility\".\n\nThe expression first appeared in Stewart Chaplin's short story \"Stained Glass Political Platform\" (published in 1900 in \"The Century Magazine\"), in which weasel words were described as \"words that suck the life out of the words next to them, just as a weasel sucks the egg and leaves the shell\". Theodore Roosevelt attributed the term to his friend William Sewall's older brother, Dave, claiming that he used the term in a private conversation in 1879. In another early usage, Theodore Roosevelt argued in 1916 that \"one of our defects as a nation is a tendency to use ...'weasel words'; when one 'weasel word' is used ... after another there is nothing left\".\n\nA 2009 study of Wikipedia found that most weasel words in it could be divided into three main categories:\n\nOther forms of weasel words may include these:\n\n\"Generalizing\" by means of quantifiers, such as \"many\", when quantifiable measures could be provided, obfuscates the point being made, and if done deliberately is an example of \"weaseling\".\n\n\"Non sequitur\", where illogical or irrelevant statements can be used, such as in advertising, can make it appear that the statement describes a beneficial feature of a product or service being advertised. An example is the endorsement of products by celebrities, regardless of whether they have any expertise relating to the product. In non sequitur fashion, it does not follow that the endorsement provides any guarantee of quality or suitability.\n\n\"False authority\" is defined as the use of the passive voice without specifying an actor or agent. For example, saying \"it has been decided\" without stating by whom, and citation of unidentified \"authorities\" or \"experts\", provide further scope for weaseling. It can be used in combination with the reverse approach of discrediting a contrary viewpoint by glossing it as \"claimed\" or \"alleged\". This embraces what is termed a \"semantic cop-out\", represented by the term \"allegedly\". This implies an absence of ownership of opinion, which casts a limited doubt on the opinion being articulated. The construction \"mistakes were made\" enables the speaker to acknowledge error without identifying those responsible.\n\nHowever, the passive voice is legitimately used when the identity of the actor or agent is irrelevant. For example, in the sentence \"one hundred votes are required to pass the bill\", there is no ambiguity, and the actors including the members of the voting community cannot practicably be named even if it were useful to do so.\n\nThe scientific journal article is another example of the legitimate use of the passive voice. For an experimental result to be useful, anyone who runs the experiment should get the same result. That is, the identity of the experimenter should be of low importance. Use of the passive voice focuses attention upon the actions, and not upon the actor—the author of the article. To achieve conciseness and clarity, however, most scientific journals encourage authors to use the active voice where appropriate, identifying themselves as \"we\" or even \"I\".\n\nThe \"middle voice\" can be used to create a misleading impression. For example:\n\nThe first of these also demonstrates false authority, in that anyone who disagrees incurs the suspicion of being unreasonable merely by dissenting. Another example from international politics is use of the phrase \"the international community\" to imply a false unanimity.\n\n\"Euphemism\" may be used to soften and potentially mislead the audience. For example, the dismissal of employees may be referred to as \"rightsizing\", \"headcount reduction\", and \"downsizing\". Jargon of this kind is used to describe things euphemistically.\n\n\"Restricting information\" available to the audience is a technique sometimes used in advertisements. For example, stating that a product \"... is now 20% cheaper!\" raises the question, \"Cheaper than what?\". It might be said that \"Four out of five people prefer ...\" something, but this raises the questions of the size and selection of the sample, and the size of the majority. \"Four out of five\" could actually mean that there had been 8% for, 2% against, and 90% indifferent.\n\nWeasel words can also be used to try to weaken factual statements, for example \"The ruling was met with criticism by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch\" can be amended to read \"The ruling was met with criticism by \"some\" human rights organizations such as...\"\n\nIn \"Report on Unidentified Flying Objects\" (1956), US Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt described astronomer Dr. J. Allen Hynek's report on the death of pilot Thomas Mantell in pursuit of a UFO as \"a masterpiece in the art of 'weasel wording'.\"\n\nCarl Wrighter discussed weasel words in his best-selling book \"I Can Sell You Anything\" (1972).\n\nAustralian author Don Watson devoted two volumes (\"Death Sentence\" and \"Watson's Dictionary of Weasel Words\") to documenting the increasing use of weasel words in government and corporate language. He maintains a website encouraging people to identify and nominate examples of weasel words.\n\nScott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, talks much about 'weasels' as being conniving businesspeople in one of his books, named accordingly: \"Dilbert and the Way of the Weasel\" (2002).\n\n"}
{"id": "2220159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220159", "title": "Writing implement", "text": "Writing implement\n\nA writing implement or writing instrument is an object used to produce writing. Most of these items can be also used for other functions such as painting, drawing and technical drawing, but writing instruments generally have the ordinary requirement to create a smooth, controllable line.\n\nAnother writing implement employed by a smaller population, is the stylus used by blind users in conjunction with the slate for punching out the dots in Braille.\n\nThese have an inherent functionality in that their useful life corresponds to the length of their physical existence, i.e. they cannot \"run out\" and persist as useless objects.\n\nThe oldest known examples were created by incising a flat surface with a rigid tool rather than applying pigment with a secondary object, e.g., Chinese jiaguwen carved into turtle shells. However, this may simply represent the relative durability of such artifacts rather than truly representing the evolution of techniques, as the meaningful application of pigment is attested in prehistoric cave paintings such as the ones at Lascaux.\n\nThe ancient Sumerians and their successor cultures, such as the Babylonians, produced their cuneiform writing by pressing a triangular stylus into soft clay tablets, creating characteristic wedge-shaped marks. The clay tablets were then baked to harden them and permanently preserve the marks.\n\nSeveral other ancient cultures such as Mycenaean Greece also inscribed their records into clay tablets but did not routinely bake them; much of the Linear B corpus from Minoan Crete was accidentally preserved by a catastrophic fire which hard-baked those tablets. The Romans used lead styli with wax tablets which could be \"erased\" by rubbing the beeswax surface smooth again.\n\nIn the modern era, hand held computers and certain other computer input devices use a stylus to enter information onto a screen by applying pressure rather than by depositing pigment.\n\nWords and names are still commonly inscribed into commemorative objects, such as the engraved winners' names on the silver Stanley Cup or the Gettysburg Address carved into the stone wall of the Lincoln Memorial, but the requisite tools are not exclusively considered to be writing instruments.\n\nThe original form of \"lead pencil\" was the leaden stylus used by the ancient Romans, who also used it to write on wood or papyrus by leaving dark streaks where the soft metal rubbed off onto the surface. The concept has been revived in recent times as the core of the \"inkless pen\": a lead-based metal alloy that leaves dark markings on paper by abrading small pieces of core onto the surface.\n\nHowever, most modern \"lead pencils\" have a nonpoisonous core of greyish-black graphite mixed with various proportions of clay for consistency, enclosed within an outer wooden casing to protect the fragile graphite from being snapped apart or from leaving marks on the user's hand.\n\nWhite chalk has been traditionally used in schoolrooms to write on a main blackboard at the front of the room. In the 19th century, and indeed well into the 20th century, when paper was less readily available, individual students also wrote with chalk on their own small slates.\n\nBoth pencils and chalk exist in variants which can create marks in other colors, but colored pencils and colored chalk are generally considered to be art supplies rather than writing instruments. Similarly, although very young children may use colorful wax crayons to write words into their pictures, writing is not considered to be the primary use of crayons.\n\nA wax pencil resembles both a crayon and a pencil in that it contains a brightly colored wax core within a protective paper casing, but its proportions are closer to that of a standard pencil. Wax pencils are primarily used to write onto nonporous surfaces such as porcelain or glass.\n\nNormal pencils, chalk, and crayons all share the characteristic that they cannot \"run out\". The useful life of these implements is closely linked to their physical existence. However, specialized accessories such as pencil sharpeners may be required to reshape the working end of the pigment core or to remove the outer casing from around the tip.\n\nThese require the presence of an added pigment in order to write, and are useless when \"empty\".\n\nThe pen is the most common form of writing implement. It has a hard tip which applies ink to a surface.\n\nInitially, pens were made by slicing a suitable nib point from the end of a thin, hollow natural material which could retain a small reservoir of ink by capillary action. However, these ink reservoirs were relatively small, requiring the pen to be periodically dipped back into an external inkwell for replenishing.\n\nReed pens were used by the ancient Egyptians to write on papyrus. Quill pens were standard in Europe and the United States up through the 18th and 19th centuries, and are still used in various contexts, such as calligraphy and formal settings such as major bank transactions. The most common quills were taken from the wings of geese or ravens, although the feathers of swans and peacocks were sometimes favored for prestige.\n\nA dip pen has a steel nib (the pen proper) and a pen-holder. Dip pens are very versatile, as the pen-holder can accommodate a wide variety of nibs that are specialized for different purposes: copperplate writing, mapping pens, and five-pointed nibs for drawing music staves. They can be used with most types of ink, some of which are incompatible with other types of pen. Automatic pens are a category of dip pen, in which the nib is in two parts and can hold a larger quantity of ink. However, like all of its precursors, the steel-nibbed dip pens had a limited ink reservoir and a tendency to drip inkblots on the page.\n\nFountain pens were developed in the 19th century. These consist of the nib unit, an ink reservoir chamber, and an external casing. The casing usually includes a cover for the nib, in order to protect its shape and keep the ink from evaporating dry or wicking into the user's pocket. Depending on the design of the pen, the ink reservoir can be filled in several different ways: direct addition by eyedropper, suction from an internal mechanism, or disposable pre-filled cartridges. Some cartridge-based fountain pens can be fitted with \"converters\", which are separate piston/suction reservoirs of the same dimensions as the pen's usual refill cartridge; these allow the pen to refill from bottled ink.\n\nOnly certain types of ink can be used in a fountain pen, to avoid clogging up the nib unit mechanism. Although the larger reservoir of fountain pens requires less frequent ink replenishment, the ink may inconveniently spill out in certain contexts to stain the paper, fingers, or clothing of an unwary writer. Differences in air pressure may cause spectacular effects when travelling by airplane.\n\nA large number of new pen types were popularized in the 20th century. Some of them are not constructed to be refilled with ink after they run dry; although others can theoretically have their internal ink compartment replaced, the widespread custom is to simply throw away the entire pen when its ink is no longer accessible.\n\nThese types include the ballpoint pen (often called a biro in many Commonwealth countries) and the felt tip pen. Both of these have subtypes which are popularly called by their own specific names, usually based on the type of their ink, such as the fluorescent highlighter, the rollerball pen, and the gel pen.\n\nUnlike the construction of a traditional wooden pencil around a solid graphite core, a mechanical pencil feeds a small, mobile piece of graphite through its tip. An internal mechanism controls the position of the graphite by friction, so that although it remains steady while writing, the graphite can be advanced forward to compensate for gradual wear or retracted to protect it when not in use. The graphite in mechanical pencils is typically much narrower than in wooden pencils, frequently in sub-millimeter diameters. This makes them particularly useful for fine diagrams or small handwriting, although different sizes of refill leads cannot be interchanged in the same pencil unless it has been specially designed for that purpose.\n\nAlthough in Western civilization writing is usually done with some form of pencil or pen, other cultures have used other instruments. Chinese characters are traditionally written with a brush, which is perceived as lending itself to a graceful, flowing stroke.\n\nA brush differs from a pen in that instead of a rigid nib, the brush is tipped with soft bristles. The bristles are gently swept across the paper with just enough pressure to allow ink to wick onto the surface, rather than mashing down the brush to the extent of substantial friction resistance. Although pens with semi-flexible nibs and liquid ink can also vary their stroke width depending on the degree of applied pressure, their variation range is far less obvious.\n\nTraditionally, brushes have been loaded with ink by dipping the bristles into an external pool of ink on an inkstone, analogous to a traditional dip pen with an inkwell. Some companies now make \"brush pens\" which in that regard resemble a fountain pen, with an internal ink reservoir built into the handle which can be refilled with preloaded cartridges or a bottle-fill converter.\n\nOther implements indirectly associated with writing include erasers for pen and pencil, pencil sharpeners, pencil extenders, inkwells, blotter paper, and rulers and related drawing instruments. Pounce pots were a precursor of blotting paper, being a dispenser for powdery material for drying the paper. Stencils can be used to create standardised letters, patterns or signatures.\n\n"}
{"id": "54946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54946", "title": "Yaoi", "text": "Yaoi\n\nYaoi (; ), also known as or , is a genre of fictional media originating in Japan that features homoerotic relationships between male characters. It is typically created by women for women and is distinct from homoerotic media marketed to gay male audiences, such as bara, but it also attracts male readers. It spans a wide range of media, including manga, anime, drama CDs, novels, games, and fan production. \"Boys love\" and its abbreviation BL are the generic terms for this kind of media in Japan and have, in recent years, become more commonly used in English as well. However, \"yaoi\" remains more generally prevalent in English.\n\nA defining characteristic of yaoi is the practice of pairing characters in relationships according to the roles of \"seme\", the sexual top or active pursuer, and \"uke\", the sexual bottom or passive pursuant. Common themes in yaoi include forbidden relationships, depictions of non-consensual sex, tragedy, and humor. Yaoi and BL stories cover a diverse range of genres such as high school love comedy, period drama, science fiction and fantasy, detective fiction and include sub-genres such as omegaverse and \"shotacon.\"\n\nYaoi finds its origins in both fan culture and commercial publishing. As James Welker has summarized, the term yaoi dates back to \"dōjinshi\" culture of the late 1970s to early 1980s where, as a portmanteau of \"yamanashi ochinashi iminashi\" (no climax, no point, no meaning), it was a self-deprecating way to refer to amateur fan works that parodied mainstream manga and anime by depicting the male characters from popular series in vaguely or explicitly sexual situations. The use of yaoi to refer to parody \"dōjinshi\" is still predominant in Japan. In commercial publishing, the genre can be traced back to \"shōnen'ai\", a genre of beautiful boy manga that began to appear in \"shōjo manga\" magazines in the early 1970s. From the 1970s to 1980s, other terms such as \"tanbi\" and \"June\" emerged to refer to specific developments in the genre. In the early 1990s, however, these terms were largely eclipsed with the commercialization of male-male homoerotic media under the label of boys love.\n\nYaoi currently has a robust global presence. Yaoi works are available across the continents in various languages both through international licensing and distribution and through circulation by fans. Yaoi works, culture, and fandom have also been studied and discussed by scholars and journalists worldwide.\n\nThe genre currently known as \"Boy's Love\", \"BL\", or \"yaoi\" derives from two sources. Female authors writing for shōjo (girl's) manga magazines in the early 1970s published stories featuring platonic relationships between young boys, which were known as \"tanbi\" (aesthetic) or \"shōnen ai\" (boy love). In the late 1970s going into the 1980s, women and girls in the dōjinshi (fan fiction) markets of Japan started to produce sexualized parodies of popular shōnen (boy's) anime and manga stories in which the male characters were recast as gay lovers. By the end of the 1970s, magazines devoted to the nascent genre started to appear, and in the 1990s the term \"boys' love\" or \"BL\" would be invented and would become the dominant term used for the genre in Japan. Although \"yaoi\" derives from girl's and women's manga and still targets the shōjo and josei demographics, it is currently considered a separate category.\n\nKeiko Takemiya's manga serial \"Kaze to Ki no Uta\", first published in 1976, was groundbreaking in its depictions of \"openly sexual relationships\" between men, spurring the development of the boys' love genre in \"shōjo\" manga, as well as the development of sexually explicit amateur comics. Another noted female manga author, Kaoru Kurimoto, wrote \"shōnen ai mono\" stories in the late 1970s that have been described as \"the precursors of \"yaoi\"\".\n\nThe term \"yaoi\" is an acronym created in the late 1970s by Yasuko Sakata and Akiko Hatsu from the words . This phrase was first used as a \"euphemism for the content\" and refers to how \"yaoi\", as opposed to the \"difficult to understand\" \"shōnen-ai\" being produced by the Year 24 Group female manga authors, focused on \"the yummy parts\". The phrase also parodies a classical style of plot structure. Kubota Mitsuyoshi says that Osamu Tezuka used \"yama nashi, ochi nashi, imi nashi\" to dismiss poor quality manga, and this was appropriated by the early yaoi authors. As of 1998, the term \"yaoi\" was considered \"common knowledge to manga fans\". A joking alternative yaoi acronym among \"fujoshi\" (female yaoi fans) is . In the 1980s, the genre was presented in an anime format for the first time, including the works \"Patalliro!\" (1982) which showed a romance between two supporting characters, an adaptation of \"Kaze to Ki no Uta\" (1987) and \"Earthian\" (1989), released in the original video animation (home video) format.\n\nPrior to the popularization of the term \"yaoi\", material in the nascent genre was called , a name derived from \"Juné\", a magazine that published male/male romances which took its name from the homoerotic stories of the French writer Jean Genet. In China, the term \"danmei\" is used, which is derived from \"tanbi\". The term \"bishōnen manga\" was used in the 1970s, but fell from favor in the 1990s when manga in this genre began to feature a broader range of protagonists beyond the traditional adolescent boys. In Japan, the term \"juné\" would die out in favor of \"boys' love\", which remains the most common name in Japan. Mizoguchi suggests that publishers wishing to get a foothold in the \"juné\" market coined \"boys' love\" to disassociate the genre from the publisher of \"Juné\".\n\nWhile \"yaoi\" has become an umbrella term in the West for women's manga or Japanese-influenced comics with male-male relationships, and it is the term preferentially used by American manga publishers for works of this kind, Japan uses the term \"yaoi\" to denote \"dōjinshi\" and works that focus on sex scenes. In both usages, \"yaoi\" / \"boy's love\" excludes \"gei comi (bara)\", a genre which also depicts gay male sexual relationships but is written for and mostly by gay men. In the West, the term \"hentai yaoi\" is sometimes used to denote the most explicit titles. The use of \"yaoi\" to denote those works with explicit scenes sometimes clashes with use of the word to describe the genre as a whole, creating confusion between Japanese and Western writers or between Western fans who insist on proper usage of the Japanese terms and those who use the Westernized versions. \"Yaoi\" can also be used by Western fans as a label for anime or manga-based slash fiction. In Japan, the term yaoi is occasionally written as \"801\", which can be read as yaoi through Japanese wordplay: the short reading of the number eight is \"ya\", zero can be read as \"o\" (a western influence), while the short reading for one is \"i\".\n\nThe term \"shōnen-ai\" (boy love) originally connoted ephebophilia or pederasty in Japan, but from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, was used to describe a new genre of shōjo manga, primarily produced by the Year 24 Group of women authors, about beautiful boys in love. Characteristics of shōnen-ai include exoticism, often taking place in Europe, and idealism. Jeffrey Angles particularly notes Moto Hagio's \"The Heart of Thomas\" (1974) and Keiko Takemiya's \"Kaze to Ki no Uta\" (1976–1984) as being groundbreaking, noting their portrayal of intense friendship between males, including jealousy and desire.\n\nThe origin of shonen-ai is thought to come through two pathways. Mizoguchi traces the tales back to the \"tanbi\" romances of Mori Mari. The term \"tanbi\" was used for stories written for and about the worship of beauty, and romance between older men and beautiful youths using particularly flowery language and unusual kanji (Chinese characters appropriated into Japanese script). Mori Mari in , considered \"the first work of [yaoi]\", used such unusual kanji for her characters' names that she converted to spelling their names in katakana, a script used to transcribe foreign words. The word was originally used to describe an author's distinctive style, for example, the styles of Yukio Mishima and Jun'ichirō Tanizaki. Akiko Mizoguchi describes its application to male-male stories as \"misleading\", but notes \"it was the most commonly used term in the early 1990s.\" According to James Welker, Minori Ishida shows that \"early boys love narratives\" were inspired by European fiction about \"beautiful boys\", and the writing of the male author Taruho Inagaki. Carola Bauer cites the \"bildungsroman\" genre as having influenced shonen-ai.\n\nKazuko Suzuki describes shōnen-ai as being \"pedantic\" and \"difficult to understand\", saying that they required \"knowledge of classic literature, history and science\" and were replete with \"philosophical and abstract musings\". Shōnen-ai challenged young readers, who were often only able to understand the references and deeper themes as they grew older and instead were initially drawn to the figure of the male protagonist. Galbraith defines \"shōnen ai\" as \"original content that can approach serious literature in tone and theme\", as opposed to a more light-hearted \"yaoi\". By the late 1980s, the popularity of professionally published shōnen-ai was declining, and dōjinshi (self-published) yaoi was becoming more popular.\n\nThe terms \"yaoi\" and \"shōnen-ai\" are sometimes used by Western fans to differentiate between two variants of the genre. In this case, \"yaoi\" is used to describe titles that primarily feature sexually explicit themes and sex scenes, while \"shōnen-ai\" is used to describe titles that focus primarily on romance and omit explicit sexual content, although sexual acts may be implied. According to this use of the terms, \"Gravitation\" would be considered \"shōnen-ai\" due to its focus on the characters' careers rather than their love life.\n\nThe two participants in a yaoi relationship (and to a lesser extent in yuri) are often referred to as \"seme\" (\"top\") and \"uke\" (\"bottom\"). These terms originated in martial arts: \"seme\" derives from the \"ichidan\" verb \"to attack\", while \"uke\" is taken from the verb \"to receive\" and is used in Japanese gay slang to mean the receptive partner (\"bottom\") in anal sex. Aleardo Zanghellini suggests that the martial arts terms have special significance to a Japanese audience, as an archetype of the gay male relationship in Japan includes same-sex love between samurai and their companions. The \"seme\" and \"uke\" are often drawn in the bishōnen style and are \"highly idealised\", blending both masculine and feminine qualities.\n\nZanghellini suggests that the samurai archetype is responsible for \"the 'hierarchical' structure and age difference\" of some relationships portrayed in yaoi and boys' love. The \"seme\" is often depicted as the stereotypical male of anime and manga culture: restrained, physically powerful, and protective. The \"seme\" is generally older and taller, with a stronger chin, shorter hair, smaller eyes, and a more stereotypically masculine, and \"macho\" demeanour than the \"uke\". The \"seme\" usually pursues the \"uke\", who often has softer, androgynous, feminine features with bigger eyes and a smaller build, and is often physically weaker than the \"seme\". Another way the \"seme\" and \"uke\" characters are shown is through who is dominant in the relationship - a character can take the uke role even if he is not presented as feminine, simply by being juxtaposed against and pursued by a more dominant, more masculine, character.\n\nAlthough not the same, a yaoi construct similar to \"seme and uke\" is the concept of tachi \"and\" neko. This archetypal pairing is referenced more often in older yaoi volumes - in modern yaoi, this pairing is often seen as already encompassed by seme and uke or simply unnecessary to address. The \"tachi\" partner is conceptualized as the member of the relationship who pursues the more passive partner, the latter of whom is referred to as the \"neko\". \"Seme and uke\" is similar but not identical to \"tachi\" and \"neko\" because the former refers primarily to sexual roles, whereas the latter describes personality. Although seme and uke roles are already used in some manga to describe which member of the relationship is more dominant and which member is more passive, there are just as many manga novels which subtly or overtly differentiate between the two. A gay male who asks out another male can initiate the relationship but also enjoy the sensation of being a bottom in anal sex.\n\nAnal sex is a prevalent theme in yaoi, as nearly all stories feature it in some way. The storyline where an uke is reluctant to have anal sex with a seme is considered to be similar to the reader's reluctance to have sexual contact with someone for the first time. Zanghellini notes that illustrations of anal sex almost always position the characters to face each other, rather than in the 'doggy style.' Zanghellini also notes that the uke rarely fellates the \"seme\", but instead receives the sexual and romantic attentions of the \"seme\".\n\nThough these tropes are common in yaoi, not all works adhere to them. Carola Bauer states that the \"butch-femme\" couple dynamic discussed above became essential in the commercially published fiction of the 1990s. McLelland says that authors are \"interested in exploring, not repudiating\" the dynamics between the seme and uke. The possibility of switching roles is often a source of playful teasing and sexual excitement for the characters, indicating an interest among many genre authors in exploring the \"performative nature\" of the roles. Sometimes the bottom character will be the aggressor in the relationship, or the pair will switch their sexual roles. \"Riba\", リバ (a contraction of the English word \"reversible\") is used to describe a couple that yaoi fans think is still plausible when the partners switch their seme and uke roles. In another common mode of characters, the author will forgo the stylisations of the \"seme\" and \"uke\", and will portray both lovers as \"equally attractive handsome men.\" In this case, whichever of the two who is ordinarily in charge will take the passive role during sex.\n\nAlthough sometimes conflated with yaoi by Western commentators, gay men's manga or gei comi, also called \"Men's Love\" (\"ML\") in English and \"bara\" in Japan, caters to a gay male audience rather than a female one and tends to be produced primarily by gay and bisexual male artists (such as Gengoroh Tagame) and serialized in gay men's magazines. Bara is an even smaller niche genre in Japan than yaoi manga. Considered a subgenre of seijin (men's erotica) for gay males, bara more closely resembles comics for men (seinen) rather than comics written for female readers (shōjo/josei). Few titles have been licensed or scanlated for English-language markets.\n\nBara does not aim to recreate the heteronormative gender roles between the masculine seme and feminine uke types prominent in yaoi that is generally for a female audience. Gay men's manga is unlikely to contain scenes of \"uncontrollable weeping or long introspective pauses\", and is less likely than yaoi to \"build up a strong sense of character\" before sex scenes occur. The men in bara comics are more likely to be stereotypically masculine in behaviour and are illustrated as \"hairy, very muscular, or [having] a few excess pounds\" akin to beefcakes or bears in gay culture. While bara usually features gay romanticism and adult content, sometimes of a violent or exploitative nature, it often explores real-world or autobiographical themes and acknowledges the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan.\n\nThe \"gachi muchi\" (\"muscley-chubby\") subgenre of boys' love, also termed \"bara\" among English-speaking fans, represents a crossover between \"bara\" and \"yaoi\", with considerable overlap of writers, artists and art styles. This emergent \"boys' love\" subgenre, while still marketed primarily to women, depicts more masculine body types and is more likely to be written by gay male authors and artists; it is also thought to attract a large crossover gay male audience. Prior to the development of gachi muchi, the greatest overlap between yaoi and bara authors was in BDSM-themed publications such as \"Zettai Reido\", a yaoi anthology magazine which had a number of openly male contributors. Several female yaoi authors who have done BDSM-themed yaoi have been recruited to contribute stories to BDSM-themed bara anthologies or special issues.\n\nFemale characters often have very minor roles in yaoi, or are absent altogether. Suzuki notes that mothers in particular are portrayed in a negative light, as in \"Zetsuai 1989\" when the main character as a child witnesses his mother murdering his father. Suzuki suggests this is because the character and reader alike are seeking to substitute the absence of unconditional maternal love with the \"forbidden\" all-consuming love presented in yaoi. Nariko Enomoto, a yaoi author, states that when women are depicted in yaoi, \"it can't help but become weirdly real\". When fans produce yaoi from series that contain female characters, such as \"Gundam Wing\", the female's role is typically either minimized or the character is killed off. Yukari Fujimoto states of shōnen manga series used as inspiration for yaoi that \"it seems that yaoi readings and likeable female characters are mutually exclusive.\"\n\nEarly shōnen-ai and yaoi have been regarded as misogynistic, but Lunsing notes a decrease in misogynistic comments from characters and regards the development of the \"yuri\" genre as reflecting a reduction of internal misogyny. Alternatively, yaoi fandom is also viewed as a \"refuge\" from mainstream culture, which in this paradigm is viewed as inherently misogynistic. In recent years, it has become more popular to have a female character supporting the couple. Yaoi author Fumi Yoshinaga usually includes at least one sympathetic female character in her works. There are many female characters in Yaoi who are Fujoshi themselves.\n\nYaoi stories are often strongly homosocial, which gives the men freedom to bond with each other and to pursue shared goals together, as in dojinshi representations of \"Captain Tsubasa\", or to rival each other, as in \"Haru wo Daiteita\". This spiritual bond and equal partnership overcomes the male-female power hierarchy. To be together, many couples depicted in conventional yaoi stories must overcome obstacles that are often emotional or psychological rather than physical. The theme of the protagonists' victory in yaoi has been compared favourably to Western fairy tales, as the latter intends to enforce the status quo, but yaoi is \"about desire\" and seeks \"to explore, not circumscribe, possibilities.\" Akiko Mizoguchi noted that while homosexuality is sometimes still depicted as \"shameful\" to heighten dramatic tension, yaoi has increasingly featured stories of coming out and the characters' gradual acceptance within the wider community, such as \"Brilliant Blue\". Mizoguchi remarked that yaoi presents a far more gay-friendly depiction of Japanese society, which she contends is a form of activism among yaoi authors. Some longer-form stories, such as \"FAKE\" and \"\", depict the couple moving in together and adopting.\n\nAlthough gay male characters are empowered in yaoi manga, yaoi manga rarely explicitly addresses the reality of homophobia in Japanese society. According to Hisako Miyoshi, vice editor-in-chief for Libre Publishing, while earlier yaoi focused \"more on the homosexual way of life from a realistic perspective\", over time the genre has become less realistic and more comedic, and the stories are \"simply for entertainment\". Yaoi manga often have fantastical, historical or futuristic settings, and many fans consider the genre to be an \"escapist fantasy\". Homophobia, when it is presented as an issue at all, is used as a plot device to \"heighten the drama\", or to show the purity of the leads' love. Matt Thorn has suggested that readers of the yaoi genre, which primarily features romantic narratives, may be turned off by strong political themes such as homophobia. Makoto Tateno stated her scepticism that a focus on real gay issues will \"[become] a trend, because girls like fiction more than realism.\" Alan Williams argues that the lack of a gay identity in yaoi is due to yaoi being postmodernist.\n\nRape fantasy is a theme commonly found in yaoi manga. Anal intercourse is understood as a means of expressing commitment to a partner, and in yaoi, the \"apparent violence\" of rape is transformed into a \"measure of passion\". While Japanese society often shuns or looks down upon women who are raped in reality, the yaoi genre depicts men who are raped as still \"imbued with innocence\" and are typically still loved by their rapists after the act, a trope that may have originated with \"Kaze to Ki no Uta\". Rape scenes in yaoi are rarely presented as crimes with an assaulter and a victim: scenes where a seme rapes an uke are not depicted as symptomatic of the \"disruptive sexual/violent desires\" of the seme, but instead are a signifier of the \"uncontrollable love\" felt by a seme for an uke. Such scenes are often a plot device used to make the uke see the seme as more than just a good friend and typically result in the uke falling in love with the seme. Rape fantasy themes explore the protagonist's lack of responsibility in sex, leading to the narrative climax of the story, where \"the protagonist takes responsibility for his own sexuality\".\n\nThe 2003–2005 \"Under Grand Hotel\", set in a men's prison, has been praised for showing a more realistic depiction of rape. Authors such as Fusanosuke Inariya (of \"Maiden Rose\" fame) utilize rape not as the traditional romantic catalyst, but as a tragic dramatic plot element, rendering her stories a subversion of contemporary tropes that reinforce and reflect older tropes such as the prevalence of romantic tragedy themes. Other yaoi tend to depict a relationship that begins as non-consensual and evolves into a consensual relationship. However, Fusanosuke's stories are ones where the characters' relationship begins as consensual and devolves into non-consensual, often due to external societal pressures that label the character's gay relationship as deviant. Her stories are still characterized by fantasy, yet they do brutally and realistically illustrate scenes of sexual assault between characters.\n\n\"Juné\" stories with suicide endings were popular, as was \"watching men suffer\". Matt Thorn theorizes that depicting abuse in yaoi is a way for some readers of yaoi to \"come to terms with their own experiences of abuse\". By the mid-1990s the fashion was for happy endings. When tragic endings are shown, the cause is not infidelity, but \"the cruel and intrusive demands of an uncompromising outside world.\"\n\nAs of 1990, seven Japanese publishers included BL content in their offerings - which kickstarted the commercial publishing market of the genre. By 2003, 3.8% of weekly manga magazines were dedicated to BL. A 2008 assessment estimated that the Japanese commercial yaoi market grossed approximately 12 billion yen annually, with novel sales generating 250 million yen per month, manga generating 400 million yen per month, CDs generating 180 million yen per month, and video games generating 160 million yen per month. As of this time, magazines for BL included BE-BOY, GUSH, CHARA and CIEL. A 2010 report estimated that the yaoi market was worth approximately 21.3 billion yen in both 2009 and 2010.\n\nBesides manga and anime, there are also Boys' Love (BL) games (also known as yaoi games), usually consisting of visual novels or H games oriented around male homosexual couples for the female market. The defining factor is that both the playable character(s) and possible objects of affection are male. As with yaoi manga, the major market is assumed to be female. Games aimed at a homosexual male audience may be referred to as \"bara\". A 2006 breakdown of the Japanese commercial BL market estimated it grosses approximately 12 billion yen annually, with video games generating 160 million yen per month.\n\n\"Yaoi\" manga are sold to English-speaking countries by companies that translate and print them in English. Companies such as Digital Manga Publishing with their imprints 801 Media (for explicit \"yaoi\") and \"Juné\" (for \"romantic and sweet\" \"yaoi\"), as well as Kitty Media, and Viz Media under their imprint SuBLime. Companies that formerly published yaoi manga but are now defunct include DramaQueen, Central Park Media's Be Beautiful, \"Tokyopop\" under their imprint BLU, \"Broccoli\" under their Boysenberry imprint, and Aurora Publishing under their imprint Deux Press. Yaoi Press, based in Las Vegas and specializing in yaoi that is not of Japanese origin, remains active. According to McLelland, the earliest officially translated English-language \"yaoi\" manga was printed in 2003, and as of 2006 there were about 130 English-translated works commercially available. In March 2007, Media Blasters stopped selling \"shōnen\" manga and increased their \"yaoi\" lines in anticipation of publishing one or two titles per month that year.\n\nAmong the 135 yaoi manga published in North America between 2003 and 2006, 14% were rated for readers aged 13 years or over, 39% were rated for readers aged 15 or older, and 47% were rated for readers age 18 and up. Although American booksellers were increasingly stocking \"yaoi\" titles in 2008, their restrictions led publishers to label books conservatively, often rating books originally intended for a mid-teen readership as 18+ and distributing them in shrinkwrap. Diamond Comic Distributors valued the sales of yaoi manga in the United States at approximately $US six million in 2007. By December 2007, there were over 10 publishers in North America offering yaoi materials. \n\nOnly a select few yaoi games have been officially translated into English. In 2006, JAST USA announced they would be releasing \"Enzai\" as \"\", the first license of a yaoi game in English translation. Some fan communities have criticized the choice of such a dark and unromantic game as the US market's first exposure to the genre. JAST USA subsequently licensed \"Zettai Fukujuu Meirei\" under the title \"Absolute Obedience\", while Hirameki International licensed \"Animamundi\"; the later game, although already nonexplicit, was censored for US release to achieve a 'mature' rather than 'adults only' rating, removing some of both the sexual and the violent content. The lack of interest by publishers in licensing further titles has been attributed to widespread copyright infringement of both licensed and unlicensed games.\n\nThe Japanese fan fiction (\"dōjinshi\") subculture emerged contemporaneously with its English equivalent in the 1970s. Characteristic similarities of fan fiction in both countries include non-adherence to a standard \"narrative structure\" and a particular popularity of science fiction themes. The early yaoi dōjinshi were amateur publications not controlled by media restrictions. The stories were written by teenagers for an adolescent audience and were generally based on manga or anime characters who were likewise in their teens or early twenties. Most dōjinshi are created by amateurs who often work in \"circles\". The group CLAMP began as an amateur \"dōjinshi\" circle who worked together to create \"Saint Seiya\" parodies. Certain professional artists such as Kodaka Kazuma also create dōjinshi. Some publishing companies reviewed dōjinshi manga published in the 1980s to identify talented amateurs, leading to the discovery of Youka Nitta and numerous other artists. This practice lessened in the 1990s, but was still used to find Shungiku Nakamura.\n\nTypical yaoi dōjinshi features male-male pairings from non-romantic manga and anime. Much of the material derives from male-oriented shōnen and seinen works which contain close male-male friendships and are perceived by fans to imply elements of homoeroticism, such as with \"Captain Tsubasa\" and \"Saint Seiya\", two titles which popularized yaoi in the 1980s. \"Weekly Shonen Jump\" is known to have a large female readership who engage in yaoi readings. Publishers of shōnen manga may create \"homoerotic-themed\" merchandise as fan service to their BL fans. Comiket's co-founder Yoshihiro Yonezawa described dōjinshi as akin to \"girls playing with dolls\"; yaoi fans may ship any male-male pairing, sometimes pairing off a favourite character, or creating a story about two original male characters and incorporating established characters into the story. Any male character may become the subject of a yaoi dōjinshi, including characters from non-manga titles such as \"Harry Potter\" or \"The Lord of the Rings\", video games such as \"Kingdom Hearts\" \"Overwatch\" and \"Final Fantasy\", or real people such as politicians. Amateur authors may also create characters out of personifications of abstract concepts (such as the personification of countries in \"\") or complementary objects like salt and pepper. In Japan, the labelling of \"dōjinshi yaoi\" manga is typically composed of the two lead characters' names, separated by a multiplication sign, with the seme being first and the uke being second.\n\nAs yaoi gained popularity in the United States, a few American artists began creating original English-language manga for female readers featuring male-male couples referred to as \"American yaoi.\" The first known original English-language yaoi comic is \"Sexual Espionage #1\" by Daria McGrain, published in May 2002. Since approximately 2004, what started as a small subculture in North America has become a burgeoning market, as new publishers began producing female-oriented male/male erotic comics and manga from creators outside Japan. Because creators from all parts of the globe are published in these works, the term \"American yaoi\" fell out of use and were replaced by terms like \"Original English Language yaoi\" and \"Global Yaoi\".\n\nThe term \"global yaoi\" was coined by creators and newsgroups that wanted to distinguish the Asian specific content known as \"yaoi\", from the original English content. \"Global BL\" was shortened by comics author Tina Anderson in interviews and on her blog to the acronym \"GloBL\". High-Volume North American publishers of 'Global BL' are Yaoi Press, which continues to release illustrated fiction written by the companies CEO, Yamila Abraham under the imprint Yaoi Prose. Prior publishers include DramaQueen, which debuted its 'Global BL' quarterly anthology \"RUSH\" in 2006, and Iris Print, both ceased publishing due to financial issues. In 2015, \"Tweek x Craig\", a season 19 episode of the American animation series \"South Park\", centered upon the eponymous characters objecting to being depicted by their female schoolmates in Yaoi-themed illustrations.\n\nIn 2009, Germany saw a period of \"GloBL\" releases, with a handful of original German titles gaining popularity for being set in Asia. Some publishers of German GloBL were traditional manga publishers like Carlsen Manga, and small press publishers specializing in GloBL like The Wild Side and Fireangels Verlag.\n\nOther successful series in GloBL include web comics \"Teahouse\", \"Starfighter\", \"Purpurea Noxa\", and \"In These Words\" from artist Jo Chen's studio Guilt Pleasure, all three of which are also being promoted by Digital Manga Publishing.\n\nIn China, \"danmei\" is considered to have originated around 1998.\n\nMost yaoi fans are either teenage girls or young women. In Thailand, female readership of yaoi works is estimated at 80%, and the membership of Yaoi-Con, a yaoi convention in San Francisco, is 85% female. It is usually assumed that all female fans are heterosexual, but in Japan there is a presence of lesbian manga authors and lesbian, bisexual or questioning female readers. Recent online surveys of English-speaking readers of yaoi indicate that 50-60% of female readers self-identify as heterosexual.\n\nAlthough the genre is marketed at girls and women, there is a gay, bisexual, and heterosexual male readership as well. A survey of yaoi readers among patrons of a United States library found about one quarter of respondents were male; two online surveys found approximately ten percent of the broader Anglophone yaoi readership were male.\n\nLunsing suggests that younger Japanese gay men who are offended by \"pornographic\" content in gay men's magazines may prefer to read yaoi instead. Some gay men, however, are put off by the feminine art style or unrealistic depictions of LGBT culture in Japan and instead prefer gei comi, which some perceive to be more realistic. Lunsing notes that some of the yaoi narrative elements criticized by homosexual men, such as rape fantasies, misogyny, and characters' non-identification as gay, are also present in gei comi.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, estimates of the size of the Japanese \"yaoi\" fandom ranged from 100,000 to 500,000 people. At around that time, \"Juné\" magazine had a circulation of between 80,000 and 100,000, twice the circulation of the best selling gay lifestyle magazine \"Badi\". As of April 2005, a search for non-Japanese websites resulted in 785,000 English, 49,000 Spanish, 22,400 Korean, 11,900 Italian and 6,900 Chinese sites. In January 2007, there were approximately five million hits for \"yaoi\".\n\nA large portion of Western fans choose to pirate yaoi material because they are unable or unwilling to obtain it through sanctioned methods. For example, fans may lack a credit card for payment, or they may want to keep their yaoi private because of the dual stigma of seeking sexually explicit material which is also gay. Scanlations and other fan translation efforts are common. In addition to commercially published Japanese works, amateur dojinshi may be scanlated into English.\n\nBoys' love manga has received considerable critical attention, especially after translations of BL became commercially available outside Japan in the 21st century. Different critics and commentators have had very different views of BL. In 1983, Frederik L. Schodt, an American manga writer and translator, has observed that portrayals of gay male relationships had used and further developed bisexual themes already in existence in shoujo manga to appeal to their female audience. Japanese critics have viewed boys' love as a genre that permits their audience to avoid adult female sexuality by distancing sex from their own bodies, as well as to create fluidity in perceptions of gender and sexuality and rejects \"socially mandated\" gender roles as a \"first step toward feminism.\" Kazuko Suzuki, for example, believes that the audience's aversion to or contempt for masculine heterosexism is something which has consciously emerged as a result of the genre's popularity.\n\nMizoguchi, writing in 2003, feels that BL is a \"female-gendered space,\" as the writers, readers, artists and most of the editors of BL are female. BL has been compared to romance novels by English-speaking librarians. Parallels have also been noted in the popularity of lesbianism in pornography, and yaoi has been called a form of \"female fetishism\". Mariko Ōhara, a science fiction writer, has said that she wrote \"yaoi\" Kirk/Spock fiction as a teen because she could not enjoy \"conventional pornography, which had been made for men\", and that she had found a \"limitless freedom\" in yaoi, much like in science fiction.\n\nOther commentators have suggested that more radical gender-political issues underlie BL. In 1998, Shihomi Sakakibara argued that yaoi fans, including himself, were gay female-to-male transsexuals. Sandra Buckley believes that bishounen narratives champion \"the imagined potentialities of alternative [gender] differentiations\", while James Welker described the bishounen character as \"queer\", commenting that manga critic Akiko Mizoguchi saw \"shōnen-ai\" as playing a role in how she herself had become a lesbian. Dru Pagliassotti sees this and the \"yaoi ronsō\" as indicating that for Japanese gay and lesbian readers, BL is not as far removed from reality as heterosexual female readers like to claim. Welker has also written that boys love titles liberate the female audience \"not just from patriarchy, but from gender dualism and heteronormativity.\"\n\nSome gay and lesbian commentators have criticized how gay identity is portrayed in BL, most notably in the \"yaoi ronsō\" or \"\"yaoi\" debate\" of 1992–1997. A trope of yaoi that has attracted criticism is male protagonists who do not identify as gay, but are rather simply in love with each other. This is said to heighten the theme of all-conquering love, but is also condemned for avoiding the need to address prejudices against people who state that they were born gay, lesbian or bisexual. Yaoi stories (such as 1987's \"Tomoi\" and 1996-1998's \"New York, New York\" ()) have increasingly featured characters that identify as gay. Criticism of the stereotypically \"girly\" behaviour of the uke has also been prominent.\n\nJapanese gay activist Satou Masaki criticized \"yaoi\" fans and artists in an open letter to the feminist zine \"Choisir \"in May 1992, writing that the genre was lacking in any accurate information about gay men and conveniently avoided the very real prejudice and discrimination that gay men faced as a part of society. More significantly, its portrayal of gay men as wealthy, handsome and well-educated was simply a vehicle for heterosexual female masturbation fantasies. An extensive debate ensued, with yaoi fans and artists arguing that \"yaoi\" is entertainment for women, not education for gay men, and that \"yaoi\" characters are not meant to represent \"real gay men.\" As internet resources for gay men developed in the 1990s, the \"yaoi\" debate waned but occasionally resurfaced; for example, when Mizoguchi in 2003 characterized stereotypes in modern BL as being \"unrealistic and homophobic\".\n\nThere has been similar criticism to the Japanese \"yaoi\" debate in the English-speaking fandom. In 1993 and 2004, Matt Thorn pointed to the complexity of these phenomena, and suggested that \"yaoi\" and slash fiction fans are discontented with \"the standards of femininity to which they are expected to adhere and a social environment that does not validate or sympathize with that discontent.\"\n\nIn China, BL became very popular in the late 1990s, attracting media attention, which became negative, focusing on the challenge it posed to \"heterosexual hegemony.\" Publishing and distributing BL is illegal in mainland China. Zanghellini notes that due to the \"characteristics of the yaoi/BL genre\" of showing characters who are often underage engaging in romantic and sexual situations, child pornography laws in Australia and Canada \"may lend themselves to targeting yaoi/BL work\". He notes that in the UK, cartoons are exempt from child pornography laws unless they are used for child grooming.\n\nIn 2001, a controversy erupted in Thailand regarding gay male comics. Television reports labelled the comics as negative influences, while a newspaper falsely stated that most of the comics were not copyrighted as the publishers feared arrest for posting the content; in reality most of the titles were likely illegally published without permission from the original Japanese publishers. The \"shōnen ai\" comics provided profits for the comic shops, which sold between 30 and 50 such comics per day. The moral panic regarding the gay male comics subsided. The Thai girls felt too embarrassed to read heterosexual stories, so they read gay male-themed josei and shōjo stories, which they saw as \"unthreatening.\"\n\nYouka Nitta has said that \"even in Japan, reading boys' love isn't something that parents encourage\" and encouraged any parents who had concerns about her works to read them. Although in Japan, concern about manga has been mostly directed to \"shōnen\" manga, in 2006, an email campaign was launched against the availability of BL manga in Sakai City's public library. In August 2008, the library decided to stop buying more BL, and to keep its existing BL in a collection restricted to adult readers. That November, the library was contacted by people who protested against the removal, regarding it as \"a form of sexual discrimination\". The Japanese media ran stories on how much BL was in public libraries, and emphasised that this sexual material had been loaned out to minors. Debate ensued on Mixi, a Japanese social networking site, and the library would return its BL to the public collection. Mark McLelland suggests that BL may become \"a major battlefront for proponents and detractors of 'gender free' policies in employment, education and elsewhere.\"\n\n\n"}
