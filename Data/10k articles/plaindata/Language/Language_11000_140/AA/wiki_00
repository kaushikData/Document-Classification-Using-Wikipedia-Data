They are named after Stål Aanderaa, Richard M. Karp, and Arnold L. Rosenberg. According to the conjecture, for a wide class of properties, no algorithm can guarantee that it will be able to skip any questions: any algorithm for determining whether the graph has the property, no matter how clever, might need to examine every pair of vertices before it can give its answer. A property satisfying this conjecture is called evasive.\n\nMore precisely, the Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture states that any deterministic algorithm must test at least a constant fraction of all possible pairs of vertices, in the worst case, to determine any non-trivial monotone graph property; in this context, a property is monotone if it remains true when edges are added (so planarity is not monotone, but non-planarity is monotone). A stronger version of this conjecture, called the evasiveness conjecture or the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture, states that exactly tests are needed. Versions of the problem for randomized algorithms and quantum algorithms have also been formulated and studied.\n\nThe deterministic Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture was proven by , but the stronger Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture remains unproven. Additionally, there is a large gap between the conjectured lower bound and the best proven lower bound for randomized and quantum query complexity.\n\nThe property of being non-empty (that is, having at least one edge) is monotone, because adding another edge to a non-empty graph produces another non-empty graph. There is a simple algorithm for testing whether a graph is non-empty: loop through all of the pairs of vertices, testing whether each pair is connected by an edge. If an edge is ever found in this way, break out of the loop, and report that the graph is non-empty, and if the loop completes without finding any edges, then report that the graph is empty. On some graphs (for instance the complete graphs) this algorithm will terminate quickly, without testing every pair of vertices, but on the empty graph it tests all possible pairs before terminating. Therefore, the query complexity of this algorithm is \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2: in the worst case, the algorithm performs \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2 tests.\n\nThe algorithm described above is not the only possible method of testing for non-emptiness, but\nthe Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture implies that every deterministic algorithm for testing non-emptiness has the same query complexity, \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2. That is, the property of being non-empty is \"evasive\". For this property, the result is easy to prove directly: if an algorithm does not perform \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2 tests, it cannot distinguish the empty graph from a graph that has one edge connecting one of the untested pairs of vertices, and must give an incorrect answer on one of these two graphs.\n\nIn the context of this article, all graphs will be simple and undirected, unless stated otherwise. This means that the edges of the graph form a set (and not a multiset) and each edge is a pair of distinct vertices. Graphs are assumed to have an implicit representation in which each vertex has a unique identifier or label and in which it is possible to test the adjacency of any two vertices, but for which adjacency testing is the only allowed primitive operation.\n\nInformally, a graph property is a property of a graph that is independent of labeling. More formally, a graph property is a mapping from the set of all graphs to {0,1} such that isomorphic graphs are mapped to the same value. For example, the property of containing at least 1 vertex of degree 2 is a graph property, but the property that the first vertex has degree 2 is not, because it depends on the labeling of the graph (in particular, it depends on which vertex is the \"first\" vertex). A graph property is called non-trivial if it doesn't assign the same value to all graphs. For instance, the property of being a graph is a trivial property, since all graphs possess this property. On the other hand, the property of being empty is non-trivial, because the empty graph possesses this property, but non-empty graphs do not. A graph property is said to be monotone if the addition of edges does not destroy the property. Alternately, if a graph possesses a monotone property, then every supergraph of this graph on the same vertex set also possesses it. For instance, the property of being nonplanar is monotone: a supergraph of a nonplanar graph is itself nonplanar. However, the property of being regular is not monotone.\n\nThe big O notation is often used for query complexity. In short, \"f\"(\"n\") is O(\"g\"(\"n\")) if for large enough \"n\", \"f\"(\"n\") ≤ \"c g\"(\"n\") for some positive constant \"c\". Similarly, \"f\"(\"n\") is Ω(\"g\"(\"n\")) if for large enough \"n\", \"f\"(\"n\") ≥ \"c g\"(\"n\") for some positive constant \"c\". Finally, \"f\"(\"n\") is Θ(\"g\"(\"n\")) if it is both O(\"g\"(\"n\")) and Ω(\"g\"(\"n\")).\n\nThe deterministic query complexity of evaluating a function on \"n\" bits (\"x\", \"x\", ..., \"x\") is the number of bits \"x\" that have to be read in the worst case by a deterministic algorithm to determine the value of the function. For instance, if the function takes value 0 when all bits are 0 and takes value 1 otherwise (this is the OR function), then the deterministic query complexity is exactly \"n\". In the worst case, the first bits read could all be 0, and the value of the function now depends on the last bit. If an algorithm doesn't read this bit, it might output an incorrect answer. (Such arguments are known as adversary arguments.) The number of bits read are also called the number of queries made to the input. One can imagine that the algorithm asks (or queries) the input for a particular bit and the input responds to this query.\n\nThe randomized query complexity of evaluating a function is defined similarly, except the algorithm is allowed to be randomized, i.e., it can flip coins and use the outcome of these coin flips to decide which bits to query. However, the randomized algorithm must still output the correct answer for all inputs: it is not allowed to make errors. Such algorithms are called Las Vegas algorithms, which distinguishes them from Monte Carlo algorithms which are allowed to make some error. Randomized query complexity can also be defined in the Monte Carlo sense, but the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is about the Las Vegas query complexity of graph properties.\n\nQuantum query complexity is the natural generalization of randomized query complexity, of course allowing quantum queries and responses. Quantum query complexity can also be defined with respect to Monte Carlo algorithms or Las Vegas algorithms, but it is usually taken to mean Monte Carlo quantum algorithms.\n\nIn the context of this conjecture, the function to be evaluated is the graph property, and the input is a string of size \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2, which gives the locations of the edges on an \"n\" vertex graph, since a graph can have at most \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2 possible edges. The query complexity of any function is upper bounded by \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2, since the whole input is read after making \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2 queries, thus determining the input graph completely.\n\nFor deterministic algorithms, originally conjectured that for all nontrivial graph properties on \"n\" vertices, deciding whether a graph possesses this property requires Ω(\"n\") queries. The non-triviality condition is clearly required because there are trivial properties like \"is this a graph?\" which can be answered with no queries at all.\nThe conjecture was disproved by Aanderaa, who exhibited a directed graph property (the property of containing a \"sink\") which required only O(\"n\") queries to test. A \"sink\", in a directed graph, is a vertex of indegree \"n\"-1 and outdegree 0. This property can be tested with less than 3\"n\" queries . An undirected graph property which can also be tested with O(\"n\") queries is the property of being a scorpion graph, first described in . A scorpion graph is a graph containing a three-vertex path, such that one endpoint of the path is connected to all remaining vertices, while the other two path vertices have no incident edges other than the ones in the path.\n\nThen Aanderaa and Rosenberg formulated a new conjecture (the Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture) which says that deciding whether a graph possesses a non-trivial monotone graph property requires Ω(\"n\") queries. This conjecture was resolved by by showing that at least \"n\"/16 queries are needed to test for any nontrivial monotone graph property. The bound was further improved to \"n\"/9 by , then to \"n\"/4 - o(\"n\") by , then to (8/25)\"n\" - o(\"n\") by , and then to \"n\"/3 - o(\"n\") by .\n\nRichard Karp conjectured the stronger statement (which is now called the evasiveness conjecture or the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture) that \"every nontrivial monotone graph property for graphs on \"n\" vertices is evasive.\" A property is called \"evasive\" if determining whether a given graph has this property sometimes requires all \"n\"(\"n\" − 1)/2 queries. This conjecture says that the best algorithm for testing any nontrivial monotone property must (in the worst case) query all possible edges. This conjecture is still open, although several special graph properties have shown to be evasive for all \"n\". The conjecture has been resolved for the case where \"n\" is a prime power by using a topological approach. The conjecture has also been resolved for all non-trivial monotone properties on bipartite graphs by . Minor-closed properties have also been shown to be evasive for large \"n\" .\n\nRichard Karp also conjectured that Ω(\"n\") queries are required for testing nontrivial monotone properties even if randomized algorithms are permitted. No nontrivial monotone property is known which requires less than \"n\"/4 queries to test. A linear lower bound (i.e., Ω(\"n\")) on all monotone properties follows from a very general relationship between randomized and deterministic query complexities. The first superlinear lower bound for all monotone properties was given by who showed that Ω(\"n\" log \"n\") queries are required. This was further improved by to Ω(\"n\"), and then by to Ω(\"n\"). This was subsequently improved to the current best known lower bound (among bounds that hold for all monotone properties) of Ω(\"n\" log \"n\") by .\n\nSome recent results give lower bounds which are determined by the critical probability \"p\" of the monotone graph property under consideration. The critical probability \"p\" is defined as the unique \"p\" such that a random graph \"G\"(\"n\", \"p\") possesses this property with probability equal to 1/2. A random graph \"G\"(\"n\", \"p\") is a graph on \"n\" vertices where each edge is chosen to be present with probability \"p\" independent of all the other edges. showed that any monotone property with critical probability \"p\" requires formula_1 queries. For the same problem, showed a lower bound of Ω(\"n\"/\"p\").\n\nAs in the deterministic case, there are many special properties for which an Ω(\"n\") lower bound is known. Moreover, better lower bounds are known for several classes of graph properties. For instance, for testing whether the graph has a subgraph isomorphic to any given graph (the so-called subgraph isomorphism problem), the best known lower bound is Ω(\"n\") due to .\n\nFor bounded-error quantum query complexity, the best known lower bound is Ω(\"n\" log \"n\") as observed by Andrew Yao. It is obtained by combining the randomized lower bound with the quantum adversary method. The best possible lower bound one could hope to achieve is Ω(\"n\"), unlike the classical case, due to Grover's algorithm which gives an O(\"n\") query algorithm for testing the monotone property of non-emptiness. Similar to the deterministic and randomized case, there are some properties which are known to have an Ω(\"n\") lower bound, for example non-emptiness (which follows from the optimality of Grover's algorithm) and the property of containing a triangle. There are some graph properties which are known to have an Ω(\"n\") lower bound, and even some properties with an Ω(\"n\") lower bound. For example, the monotone property of nonplanarity requires Θ(\"n\") queries and the monotone property of containing more than half the possible number of edges (also called the majority function) requires Θ(\"n\") queries .\n\n"}

He was born in Mombasa, Kenya. His positions included Director of the Institute of Global Cultural Studies at Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York, and Director of the Center for Afro-American and African Studies at the University of Michigan. He produced the television documentary series \"\".\n\nMazrui was born on 24 February 1933 in Mombasa, Kenya Colony. He was the son of Al-Amin Bin Ali Mazrui, the Chief Islamic Judge in Kadhi courts of Kenya Colony. His father was also a scholar and author, and one of his books has been translated into English by Hamza Yusuf as \"The Content of Character\", to which Ali supplied a foreword. The Mazrui family was a historically wealthy and important family in Kenya, having previously been the rulers of Mombasa. Ali's father was the Chief Kadhi of Kenya, the highest authority on Islamic law. Mazrui credited his father for instilling in him the urge for intellectual debate, as his father not only participated in court proceedings but also was a renowned pamphleteer and public debater. Mazrui would, from a young age, accompany his father to court and listen in on his political and moral debates.\nMazrui initially intended to follow the path of his father as an Islamist and pursue his study in Al-Azhar University in Egypt. Due to poor performance in the Cambridge School Certificate examination in 1949, Mazrui was refused entry to Makerere College (now Makerere University), the only tertiary education institute in East Africa at that time. He then worked in the Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education (now Technical University of Mombasa).\n\nMazrui attended primary school in Mombasa, where he recalled having learned English specifically to participate in formal debates, before he turned the talent to writing. Journalism, according to Mazrui, was the first step he took down the academic road. In addition to English, Mazrui also spoke Swahili and Arabic. After getting a Kenyan Government scholarship, Mazrui furthered his study and obtained his B.A. with Distinction from Manchester University in Great Britain in 1960, his M.A. from Columbia University in New York in 1961, and his doctorate (DPhil) from Oxford University (Nuffield College) in 1966. He was influenced by Kwame Nkrumah's ideas of pan-Africanism and consciencism, which formed the backbone of his discussion on Africa's Triple Heritage (Africanity, Islam and Christianity).\n\nMazrui began his academic career at the University of Makerere in Uganda, where he had dreamed of attending since he was a child. At Makerere, Mazrui served as a professor of political science, and began drawing his international acclaim. Mazrui felt that his years at Makerere were some of the most important and productive of his life. He told his biographer that 1967, when he published three books, was the year that he had made his declaration to the academic world \"that I planned to be prolific - for better or for worse!\" During his time at Makerere, Mazrui also directed the World Order Models Project in the Department of Political Science, a project which brought together political scientists from across the world to discuss what an international route to lasting peace might be.\n\nMazrui reflected that he felt forced to leave the University of Makerere. His departure was likely the result of his desire to remain a neutral academic in the face of pressures to attach his growing prestige as a political thinker to one of the regional factions. \nHis first solicitation was from John Okello, the leader of the Zanzibar Revolution, who came to Mazrui's house in 1968 to urge Mazrui to join his cause. Okello originally tried to convince Mazrui to become an advisor to him and then simply tried to enlist Mazrui's assistance in writing a constitution for Zanzibar. Mazrui told Okello that, while he was inclined to sympathize with the cause, it would be a violation of the moral duty of a professor and an academic to join with a political agenda. This incident shows the level of international prestige that Mazrui had already accumulated. Okello had sought him out specifically because he knew and valued Ali's reputation as an anti-imperialist intellectual.\n\nMazrui was later approached by Idi Amin who was the president of Uganda at the end of Mazrui's time at Makerere. Amin, according to Mazrui, wanted Mazrui to become his special adviser. Mazrui declined this invitation, for fear that it would be unsafe, and by doing so lost his political standing in Uganda. This would be what Mazrui ultimately felt forced him to leave the University of Makerere. Mazrui often said that he would like to return to Uganda, but cited his strained relationship with the Ugandan government, as well as the unfriendliness of the Ugandan people towards a Kenyan political scientist as the factors keeping him away.\n\nIn 1974, Mazrui was hired as a professor of political science at the University of Michigan. During his time at Michigan, Mazrui also held a professorship at the University of Jos in Nigeria. He held that spending time teaching and being part of the discourse in Africa was important to not losing his understanding of the African perspective.\nFrom 1978 until 1981 Mazrui served as the Director of the Center for Afro-American and African Studies at the University of Michigan. While he had a relatively quiet tenure in the chair, his presence there was important for a couple reasons. First, it was a central view of Mazrui's that the African American and the African connection had to be strengthened. He believed the way to better Africa was to educate African Americans in global politics and to strengthen their connection with Africa, all things that could be under the purview of CAAS. However he also seemed to doubt the ability of a program like CAAS to accomplish anything. During his earlier years at U of M he criticized such programs saying that, in response to black activism, \"some universities just established a black-studies program with a kind of political cynicism which I found rather difficult to admire, to say the very least.\"\n\nMazrui taught at the University of Michigan until 1989, when he took a two-year leave of absence to accept the Albert Schweitzer professorship at SUNY Binghamton. Mazrui's departure from U of M was no less eventful than his departure from Makerere. Mazrui announced his resignation from the University of Michigan on 29 May 1991. Leading up to this point, there had been a highly publicized bidding war between U of M and SUNY. Reportedly, SUNY offered Mazrui a $500,000 package which included a $105,000 salary (as compared to his $71,500 salary at U of M) as well as the funds for three professors of Mazrui's choosing, three graduate assistants, a secretary, and travel expenses. The University of Michigan reportedly matched this offer, but Mazrui decided it was too little too late. He stated that he was unconvinced by U of M's commitment to the study of political science in the third world. Both governor Mario Cuomo from New York and Governor James Blanchard from Michigan gave Mazrui personal calls to convince him to choose the University in their states. The whole affair sparked questions about the commodification as well as the celebrity of university professors.\n\nHis departure also caused a conversation about racial diversity at the University of Michigan; a conversation he had not been a huge part of for the fifteen years while he was on the U of M campus. In spite of the University of Michigan's efforts to retain Ali Mazrui, James Duderstadt, the president of the university at the time, came under heavy fire for not being proactive enough in the retention of an esteemed black professor. Mazrui had been hired in 1974, while the university was under heavy criticism, especially from the second Black Action Movement, for not keeping its promises for diversity in the student body and among the faculty. In contrast, Duderstadt argued that, by 1989, the University was doing a much better job of diversifying. They had added 45 minority faculty that year, 13 more than the year before and the College of Literature, Science and the Arts had seen \"skyrocketing minority recruitment.\" Even still there was a worry that the university was focusing only on recruiting minorities, and not on making them stick around.\n\nIn addition to his appointments as the Albert Schweitzer Professor in the Humanities, Professor in Political Science, African Studies, Philosophy, Interpretation and Culture and the Director of the Institute of Global Cultural Studies (IGCS), Mazrui also held three concurrent faculty appointments as Albert Luthuli Professor-at-Large in the Humanities and Development Studies at the University of Jos in Nigeria, Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large Emeritus and Senior Scholar in Africana Studies at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York and Chancellor of the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Nairobi, Kenya. In 1999, Mazrui retired as the inaugural Walter Rodney Professor at the University of Guyana, Georgetown, Guyana. Mazrui has also been a Visiting Scholar at Stanford University, The University of Chicago, Colgate University, McGill University, National University of Singapore, Oxford University, Harvard University, Bridgewater State College, Ohio State University, and at other institutions in Cairo, Australia, Leeds, Nairobi, Teheran, Denver, London, Baghdad, and Sussex, amongst others. In 2005, Ali Mazrui was selected as the 73rd topmost intellectual person in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by \"Prospect Magazine\" (UK) and \"Foreign Policy\" (United States).\n\nThe inspiration for his documentary series \"\" was Ali's view was that much of modern Africa could be described by its three main influences:\n\n\nThis trinity was illustrated in Mazrui's own life. He spoke English, Arabic, and Swahili from a young age.\n\nMazrui believed there were six paradoxes that are central to understanding Africa:\n\n\nMazrui argued that, as long as Africa remained dependent on the developed world, no relationship between the developed world and Africa would be beneficial to Africa. In the face of détente between the US and the USSR, Mazrui was quoted as saying, \"When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers. When elephants make love, however, it is also the grass that suffers.\"\n\nMazrui believed the greatest resource that Africa possessed was the African people. In particular, he pointed to African Americans, arguing that they must remember their African heritage and find a way to exert their influence over U.S. foreign policy if Africa ever hopes to climb out of its marginal position. Ali explained to a friend that his joint professorship at Michigan and Jos was his attempt to be a part of such a connection.\n\nSome of Mazrui's work has been translated into English by Poetry Translation Centre.\n\nIn addition to his academic appointments, Mazrui also served as President of the African Studies Association (USA) and as Vice-President of the International Political Science Association and has also served as Special Advisor to the World Bank. He has also served on the Board of the American Muslim Council, Washington, D.C.\n\nMazrui's research interests included African politics, international political culture, political Islam and North-South relations. He is author or co-author of more than twenty books. Mazrui has also published hundreds of articles in major scholastic journals and for public media. He has also served on the editorial boards of more than twenty international scholarly journals. Mazrui was widely consulted by heads of states and governments, international media and research institutions for political strategies and alternative thoughts.\n\nHe first rose to prominence as a critic of some of the accepted orthodoxies of African intellectuals in the 1960s and 1970s. He was critical of African socialism and all strains of Marxism. He argued that communism was a Western import just as unsuited for the African condition as the earlier colonial attempts to install European type governments. He argued that a revised liberalism could help the continent and described himself as a proponent of a unique ideology of \"African liberalism\".\n\nAt the same time he was a prominent critic of the current world order. He believed the current capitalist system was deeply exploitative of Africa, and that the West rarely if ever lived up to their liberal ideals and could be described as global apartheid. He has opposed Western interventions in the developing world, such as the Iraq War. He has also long been opposed to many of the policies of Israel, being one of the first to try to link the treatment of Palestinians with South Africa's apartheid.\n\nEspecially in recent years, Mazrui has also become a well known commentator on Islam and Islamism. While rejecting violence and terrorism Mazrui has praised some of the anti-imperialist sentiment that plays an important role in modern Islamic fundamentalism. He has also argued, controversially, that sharia law is not incompatible with democracy.\n\nIn addition to his written work, Mazrui was also the creator of the television series \"\", which was jointly produced by the BBC and the Public Broadcasting Service (WETA, Washington) in association with the Nigerian Television Authority, and funded by the Annenberg/CPB Project. A book by the same title was jointly published by BBC Publications and Little, Brown and Company.\n\n\"The Africans\" was a controversial series for some. In the UK, where it aired on the BBC, it slid more or less under the radar. In the United States however, where it aired on some PBS channels, \"The Africans\" drew a great amount of scrutiny for being allegedly anti-western. According to critics, \"The Africans\" blames too many of Africa's problems on the negative influences of Europe and America, and the loudest criticisms came for the portrayal of Muammar el-Qaddafi as a virtuous leader.\n\nThe loudest critic of the documentary series was Lynne Cheney, who was at the time the chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The endowment had put $600,000 toward the funding of \"The Africans\" and Lynne Cheney felt that Mazrui had not held to the conditions on which the endowment had granted the funding. Cheney said that she was promised a variety of interviews presenting different sides of the story, and was outraged when there were no such interviews in the show. Lynne Cheney demanded that the NEH name and logo be removed from the credits. She also had the words \"A Commentary\" added to the American version of the series, alongside Ali Mazrui's credits.\n\nIn defense of \"The Africans\" and its alleged bias, Mazrui made the statement \"I was invited by PBS and the BBC to tell the American and British people about the African people, a view from the inside. I am surprised, then, that people are disappointed not to get an American view. An effort was made to be fair but not to sound attractive to Americans.\" Ward Chamberlain, the president of series co-producer WETA, also stepped in to publicly defend the series and Mazrui by saying that, in a fair telling of history, the western world shouldn’t be expected to come out looking good from the African perspective.\n\nHis experience as a controversial figure was different in the two continents. While he was surrounded by controversy at U of M (he has been accused of being anti-Semitic, anti-American, and generally radical) he wrote to his African colleagues saying that the debate had remained remarkably civil and academic. On the other hand, in Jos, things got so heated that the university faculty once put out a flyer threatening to punish anti-Mazrui libel \"in the pugilist style.\" Ironically, the libeler was a socialist accusing Mazrui of being overly imperialist for participating in western dialogues.\n\nProbably the most fire Mazrui came under during his tenure at the University of Michigan was in response to his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Mazrui was an outspoken supporter of Palestine and, more than that, an outspoken critic of the state of Israel. Mazrui made the argument that Israel and the Zionist movement behaved in an imperialist fashion and that they used their biblical beliefs and the events of the holocaust for political gain . He went so far as to call the Israeli government \"fascist\" in its behavior. Needless to say, this sparked a great deal of controversy. The large Jewish population at the University of Michigan was highly critical of these remarks, accusing him of anti-Semitism. In the campus newspaper, \"The Michigan Daily\", there was a prolonged back-and-forth in 1988. One student wroth \"Mazrui is completely ignorant regarding Jewish faith and history. To compare Israel to Nazi Germany is the ultimate racial slur … To digress from politics to anti-Semitic tones only fuels the fire of hatred.\"\n\nOn the other hand, in a joint letter to the \"Michigan Daily\", members of the Palestine Solidarity Committee wrote \"A recent letter has accused Dr. Ali Mazrui and his supporters of anti-Semitism… we categorically reject this vicious slander.\" Mazrui, in his own defense, stated unequivocally that he was anti-Zionist, but that that was a fundamentally different thing from anti-Semitism. He admitted to having problems with the Israeli government and the Zionist movement, but said that he held these views independent of any views about the Jewish people as an ethnicity.\n\nThroughout his career Mazrui held the controversial position that the only way to prevent a nuclear holocaust was to arm the third world (Africa in particular) with nuclear weapons. This was a view spotlighted in \"The Africans.\" Speaking largely with a mind to cold war international politics, Mazrui argued that the world needed more than two sides holding nuclear arms. By virtue of the continent's central location and relative non-alignment, he argued that Africa would be the perfect keeper of the peace between the East and the West. Furthermore, as long as the third world didn’t have nuclear capabilities, it would continue to be marginalized on the global stage. This view encountered heavy criticism from those who believed that the more countries with nuclear capabilities, and the more unstable those countries are politically, the greater the risk of some leader or military organization launching nuclear missiles.\n\n\n\n\nMazrui was a regular contributor to newspapers in Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa, most notably the \"Daily Nation\" (Nairobi), \"The Standard\" (Nairobi), the \"Daily Monitor\" (Kampala), and the \"City Press\" (Johannesburg).\n\n\nMazrui was ranked among the world's top 100 public intellectuals \nby readers of \"Prospect Magazine\" (UK) \"Foreign Policy Magazine\" (Washington, D.C.) (see The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll).\n\nAccording to press reports, Mazurui had not been feeling well for several months prior to his death. He died of natural causes at his home in Vestal in New York on Sunday, 12 October 2014. His body was repatriated to his hometown Mombasa and it arrived early morning on Sunday 19 October. It was taken to the family home where it was washed as per Islamic custom. The funeral prayer was held at the Mbaruk Mosque in Old Town and he was laid to rest at the family's Mazrui Graveyard opposite Fort Jesus. His burial was attended by Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala, Majority Leader Aden Bare Duale, Governor Hassan Ali Joho; and Senators Hassan Omar and Abu Chiaba.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1792946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792946", "title": "Argument Clinic", "text": "Argument Clinic\n\n\"Argument Clinic\" is a sketch from \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", written by John Cleese and Graham Chapman. The sketch was originally broadcast as part of the television series and has subsequently been performed live by the group. It relies heavily on wordplay and dialogue, and has been used as an example of how language works.\n\nMichael Palin pays a receptionist (played by Rita Davies) to have a five-minute argument. The receptionist directs him to Chapman's room, but when he walks in, Chapman hurls abuse at him. Palin interrupts, saying he wants an argument, and Chapman says he is in the wrong room, apologises and directs him to another room. As Palin leaves, Chapman calls him a \"stupid git\".\n\nPalin then enters Cleese's room, where Cleese immediately starts an argument, claiming that Palin has already been told that it is the right room. The argument is petty, and consists primarily of the two men contradicting each other. Eventually, Cleese rings a bell signifying the end of the argument, and after Palin pays for another five minutes, Cleese claims that he hasn't. Palin leaves in frustration.\n\nIn the version as originally broadcast, Palin leaves for Eric Idle's room to complain, only to have to listen to him ranting about his shoes; he moves on to Terry Jones' room, where Jones hits him on the head with a large wooden mallet, and instructs him on how to properly receive the blow. Jones clarifies the room that Palin just entered does not house the complaints department, but \"being-hit-on-the-head\" lessons. Soon enough, Inspector Fox (Chapman) enters to arrest both of them for participating in a strange sketch. A second policeman, Inspector Thomson's-Gazelle (Idle) then arrives to arrest the entire show on three counts: being overly self-referential, saying \"[name] of the Yard?!\" every time a policeman enters, and repeatedly getting out of sketches without a punchline by having a member of the forces arrest everybody. Inspector Thomson's-Gazelle himself is arrested by a third policeman (Cleese) for the latter crime, who is then arrested in turn by a hand (presumably belonging to Terry Gilliam).\n\nThe sketch parodies modern consumer culture, implying that anything can be purchased, even absurd things such as arguing, abuse, or being hit over the head.\nThe sketch was typical for Cleese's and Chapman's writing at the time, as it relied on verbal comedy. Python author Darl Larsen believes the sketch was influenced by music hall and radio comedy, particularly that of the Goons, and notes that there is little camera movement during the original television recording.\n\nOne line in the middle of the sketch, \"An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a definite proposition\" was taken almost verbatim from the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\n\nThe sketch originally appeared in the 29th episode of the original television series, entitled \"The Money Programme\", and was released (in audio only) on the LP \"Monty Python's Previous Record\", on Charisma Records in 1972.\n\nThe sketch was subsequently performed live at the Hollywood Bowl in September 1980, which was filmed and released as \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl\". The sketch features the discussion with the receptionist (played here by Carol Cleveland), the abuse from Chapman, and most of the argument between Cleese and Palin. It is then ended abruptly by the entrance of Terry Gilliam, on wires, singing \"I've Got Two Legs\". A further live performance occurred in 1989 at the Secret Policeman's Ball, where Cleveland's and Chapman's roles were replaced by Dawn French and Chris Langham. This performance was subsequently released on DVD. The sketch was performed again in July 2014 during \"Monty Python Live (Mostly)\", with Terry Jones filling in for Chapman's role and Gilliam reprising \"I've Got Two Legs\".\n\nThe sketch has been frequently used as an example of how not to argue, because, as Palin's character notes, it contains little more than ad hominem attacks and contradiction, and does not contribute to critical thinking. It has also been described as a \"classical case in point\" of dialogue where two parties are unwilling to co-operate, and as an example of flawed logic, since Palin is attempting to argue that Cleese is not arguing with him.\n\nThe text of the argument has been presented as a good example of the workings of English grammar, where sentences can be reduced to simple subject/verb pairs. It has been included as an example of analysing English in school textbooks. The sketch has become popular with philosophy students, who note that arguing is \"all we are good at\", and wonder about the intellectual exercise one could get from paying for a professional quality debate.\n\nThe Python programming language has an internal-only module called \"Argument Clinic\" to pre-process Python files.\n\n\n"}

Those on the centre-left believe in working within the established systems to improve social justice. The centre-left promotes a degree of social equality that it believes is achievable through promoting equal opportunity. The centre-left has promoted luck egalitarianism, which emphasizes the achievement of equality requires personal responsibility in areas in control by the individual person through their abilities and talents as well as social responsibility in areas outside control by the individual person in their abilities or talents.\n\nThe centre-left opposes a wide gap between the rich and the poor and supports moderate measures to reduce the economic gap, such as a progressive income tax, laws prohibiting child labour, minimum wage laws, laws regulating working conditions, limits on working hours and laws to ensure the workers' right to organize. The centre-left typically claims that complete equality of outcome is not possible, but instead that equal opportunity improves a degree of equality of outcome in society.\n\nIn Europe, the centre-left includes social democrats, progressives and also some democratic socialists, greens and the Christian left. Some social liberals are described as centre-left, but many social liberals are in the centre of the political spectrum as well.\n\nThe main ideologies of the centre-left are social democracy, social liberalism (when paired with other ideologies), progressivism, democratic socialism and green politics (also known as the red–green alliance).\nThroughout the world, centre-left groups generally support:\n\nThe term may be used to imply positions on the environment, religion, public morality, etc., but these are usually not the defining characteristics, since centre-right parties may take similar positions on these issues. A centre-left party may or may not be more concerned with reducing industrial emissions than a centre-right party.\n\nThe term \"centre-left\" appeared during the French \"July Monarchy\" in 1830s, a political-historical phase during the Kingdom of France when the House of Orléans reigned under an almost parliamentary system. The centre-left was distinct from the left, composed of republicans, as well as the centre-right, composed of the Third Party and the liberal-conservative Doctrinaires.\n\nDuring this time, the centre-left was led by Adolphe Thiers (head of the liberal-nationalist Movement Party) and Odilon Barrot, who headed the populist \"Dynastic Opposition\". The centre-left was Orléanist, but supported a liberal interpretation of the Charter of 1830, more power to the Parliament, manhood suffrage and support to rising European nationalisms. Adolphe Thiers served as Prime Minister for King Louis Philippe I twice (in 1836 and 1840), but he then lost the King's favour, and the centre-left rapidly fell.\n\nIn France, during the Second Republic and the Second Empire the centre-left was not strong or organised, but became commonly associated with the moderate republicans' group in Parliament. Finally, in 1871 the Second Empire fell as consequence of the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and Adolphe Thiers re-established the centre-left after the foundation of the Third Republic. This time the centre-left was constituted of moderate republicans, then called \"Opportunists\", anti-royalist liberals and radicals from the Republican Union. During the Third Republic, the centre-left was led by political and intellectual figures like Jules Dufaure, Édouard René de Laboulaye, Charles de Rémusat, Léon Say, William Waddington, Jean Casimir-Perier, Edmond Henri Adolphe Schérer and Georges Picot.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, centre-left movements appeared from the 1860s, mainly in Spain and Italy. In Italy, the centre-left was born as coalition between the liberal Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour and the progressive Urbano Rattazzi, the heads respectively of the Right and Left groupings in Parliament. This alliance was called \"connubio\" (\"marriage\") for its opportunist characteristics. In the 1900s, centre-left positions were expressed by people and parties who believed in social democracy and democratic socialism, but also some liberals or Christian-democrats were associated with the centre-left. Currently, the centre-left parties in Europe are united in the social democratic Party of European Socialists and ecologist European Green Party.\n\nDespite the rise of centre-left politics in continental Europe, Britain and its colonies along with the United States only saw the rise of the centre-left in the late 19th century to the early 20th century. The prevalence of the position occurred mainly due to the rise of socialism caused Liberals to move away from \"laissez-faire\" policies to more interventionist policies, which created the New Liberal movement. Currently, the Anglo-sphere major centre-left parties are the following:\n\n"}
{"id": "59125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59125", "title": "Comma", "text": "Comma\n\nThe comma is a punctuation mark that appears in several variants in different languages. It has the same shape as an apostrophe ( ' ) or single closing quotation mark in many typefaces, but it differs from them in being placed on the baseline of the text. Some typefaces render it as a small line, slightly curved or straight but inclined from the vertical, or with the appearance of a small, filled-in .\n\nThe comma is used in many contexts and languages, mainly for separating parts of a sentence such as clauses, and items in lists, particularly when there are three or more items listed. The word \"comma\" comes from the Greek (), which originally meant a cut-off piece; specifically, in grammar, a short clause.\n\nA comma-shaped mark is used as a diacritic in several writing systems, and is considered distinct from the cedilla. The rough and smooth breathings () appear above the letter in Ancient Greek, and the comma diacritic appears below the letter in Latvian, Romanian, and Livonian.\n\nThe basic comma is defined in Unicode as , and many variants by typography or language are also defined.\n\nSome languages use a completely different sort of character for the purpose of the comma.\n\nThere are also a number of comma-like diacritics with \"COMMA\" in their Unicode names. These do not serve a punctuation function. A comma-like low quotation mark is also available (shown below; raised single quotation marks are not shown).\n\nVarious other Unicode characters combine commas or comma-like figures with other characters, and are not shown here.\n\nIn the 3rd century BC, Aristophanes of Byzantium invented a system of single dots (\"distinctiones\") that separated verses (colometry) and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of the text when reading aloud. The different lengths were signified by a dot at the bottom, middle, or top of the line. For a short passage (a \"komma\"), a \"media distinctio\" dot was placed mid-level ( · ). This is the origin of the concept of a comma, although the name came to be used for the mark itself instead of the clause it separated.\n\nThe mark used today is descended from a diagonal slash, or \"virgula suspensiva\" ( / ), used from the 13th to 17th centuries to represent a pause. The modern comma was first used by Aldus Manutius.\n\nIn general, the comma shows that the words immediately before the comma are less closely or exclusively linked grammatically to those immediately after the comma than they might be otherwise. The comma performs a number of functions in English writing. It is used in generally similar ways in other languages, particularly European ones, although the rules on comma usage – and their rigidity – vary from language to language.\n\nCommas are placed between items in lists, as in \"They own a cat, a dog, two rabbits, and seven mice.\" Some English style guides recommend that a comma be used before the final conjunction (\"and\", \"or\", \"nor\") in a list of more than two elements. A comma used in such a position is variously called a serial comma, an Oxford comma, or a Harvard comma (after the Oxford University Press and Harvard University Press, both prominent advocates of this style). Such use of a comma sometimes prevents ambiguity:\n\n\nThe serial comma does not eliminate all confusion. Consider the following sentence:\n\nAs a rule of thumb, \"The Guardian Style Guide\"\nsuggests that straightforward lists (\"he ate ham, eggs and chips\") do not need a comma before the final \"and\", but sometimes it can help the reader (\"he ate cereal, kippers, bacon, eggs, toast and marmalade, and tea\"). \"The Chicago Manual of Style\", and other academic writing guides, require the serial comma: all lists must have a comma before the \"and\" prefacing the last item in a series.\n\nIf the individual items of a list are long, complex, affixed with description, or themselves contain commas, semicolons may be preferred as separators, and the list may be introduced with a colon.\n\nIn news headlines, a comma might replace the word \"and\", even if there are only two items, in order to save space, as in this headline from Reuters:\n\nCommas are often used to separate clauses. In English, a comma is used to separate a dependent clause from the independent clause if the dependent clause comes first: \"After I fed the cat, I brushed my clothes.\" (Compare this with \"I brushed my clothes after I fed the cat.\") A relative clause takes commas if it is non-restrictive, as in \"I cut down all the trees, which were over six feet tall.\" (Without the comma, this would mean that only those trees over six feet tall were cut down.) Some style guides prescribe that two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (\"for\", \"and\", \"nor\", \"but\", \"or\", \"yet\", \"so\") must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction. In the following sentences, where the second clause is independent (because it can stand alone as a sentence), the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary:\nIn the following sentences, where the second half of the sentence is not an independent clause (because it does not contain an explicit subject), those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted:\nHowever, such guides permit the comma to be omitted if the second independent clause is very short, typically when the second independent clause is an imperative, as in:\nThe above guidance is not universally accepted or applied. Long coordinating clauses are nonetheless usually separated by commas:\n\nIn some languages, such as German and Polish, stricter rules apply on comma usage between clauses, with dependent clauses always being set off with commas, and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions.\n\nThe joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction (as in \"It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.\") is known as a comma splice and is sometimes considered an error in English; in most cases a semicolon should be used instead. A comma splice should not be confused, though, with asyndeton, a literary device used for a specific effect in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted.\n\nCommas are always used to set off certain adverbs at the beginning of a sentence, including \"however\", \"in fact\", \"therefore\", \"nevertheless\", \"moreover\", \"furthermore\", and \"still\".\n\n\nIf these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence, they are followed and preceded by a comma. As in the second of the two below examples, if the two sentences are separated by a semicolon and the second sentence starts with an adverb, then it is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.\n\n\nUsing commas to offset certain adverbs is optional, including \"then\", \"so\", \"yet\", \"instead\", and \"too\" (meaning \"also\").\n\n\nCommas are often used to enclose parenthetical words and phrases within a sentence (i.e., information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence). Such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma, unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence. The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:\n\nA comma is used to separate \"coordinate adjectives\" (i.e., adjectives that directly and equally modify the following noun). Adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if \"and\" were placed between them. For example:\n\nSome writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma, as in \"Mr. Kershner says, \"You should know how to use a comma.\"\" Quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a colon rather than a comma.\n\nOther writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway. Thus they would write \"Mr. Kershner says \"You should know how to use a comma.\"\"\n\nWhen a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year, a comma separates the day from the year: December 19, 1941. This style is common in American English. The comma is used to avoid confusing consecutive numbers: December 19 1941.\nMost style manuals, including \"The Chicago Manual of Style\"\nand the \"AP Stylebook\",\nalso recommend that the year be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after it: \"Feb. 14, 1987, was the target date.\"\n\nIf just month and year are given, no commas are used: \"Her daughter April may return in June 2009 for the reunion.\"\n\nWhen the day precedes the month, the month name separates the numeric day and year, so commas are not necessary to separate them: \"The Raid on Alexandria was carried out on 19 December 1941.\"\n\nCommas are used to separate parts of geographical references, such as city and state (\"Dallas, Texas\") or city and country (\"Kampala, Uganda\"). Additionally, most style manuals, including \"The Chicago Manual of Style\"\nand the \"AP Stylebook\",\nrecommend that the second element be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after: \"The plane landed in Kampala, Uganda, that evening.\"\n\nThe United States Postal Service and Royal Mail recommend leaving out punctuation when writing addresses on actual letters and packages, as the marks hinder optical character recognition.\n\nIn representing large numbers, from the right side to the left, English texts usually use commas to separate each group of three digits in front of the decimal. This is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits and often for five or four digits but not in front of the number itself. However, in much of Europe, Southern Africa and Latin America, periods or spaces are used instead; the comma is used as a decimal separator, equivalent to the use in English of the decimal point. In India, the groups are two digits, except for the rightmost group. In some styles, the comma may not be used for this purpose at all (e.g. in the SI writing style); a space may be used to separate groups of three digits instead.\n\nCommas are used when rewriting names to present the surname first, generally in instances of alphabetization by surname: \"Smith, John.\" They are also used before many titles that follow a name: \"John Smith, Ph.D.\"\n\nSimilarly in lists that are presented with an inversion: \"...; socks, green: 3 pairs; socks, red: 2 pairs; tie, regimental: 1\".\n\nCommas may be used to indicate that a word, or a group of words, has been omitted, as in \"The cat was white; the dog, brown.\" (Here the comma replaces \"was\".)\n\nCommas are placed before, after, or around a noun or pronoun used independently in speaking to some person, place or thing:\n\nIn his 1785 essay \"An Essay on Punctuation\", Joseph Robertson advocated a comma between the subject and predicate of long sentences for clarity; however, this usage is regarded as an error in modern times.\n\nThe comma and the quotation mark pairing can be used in several ways. In American English, the comma is commonly included inside a quotation mark:\nIn Great Britain and many other parts of the world, punctuation is usually placed within quotation marks only if it is part of what is being quoted or referred to:\n\nThere is also some difference regarding the use of the serial comma, which is an optional comma placed before the coordinating conjunction in a list of three or more items:\n\n\nThe serial comma is also known as the Oxford comma, Harvard comma, or series comma. It is sometimes perceived as overly careful or an Americanism, but its usage occurs within both American and British English. It is called the Oxford comma because of its long history of use by Oxford University Press.\n\nOpinions among writers and editors differ on whether to use the serial comma. A majority of American style guides mandate use of the serial comma, including \"The Chicago Manual of Style\", Strunk and White's \"The Elements of Style\", and the \"U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual\". The \"AP Stylebook\" for journalistic writing advises against it. It is used less often in British English, but some British style guides require it, including the Oxford University Press style manual and Fowler's \"Modern English Usage\". Some writers of British English use it only where necessary to avoid ambiguity.\n\nAccording to \"New Hart's Rules\", \"house style will dictate\" whether to use the serial comma, and \"The general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently.\" No association with region or dialect is suggested, other than that its use has been strongly advocated by Oxford University Press.\n\nBarbara Child advises that \"it is a good idea to put a comma before the last item in a series\", but claims that in the United States there is a trend toward a decreased use of the comma generally. This is reinforced by an article by Robert J. Samuelson in \"Newsweek\". Lynne Truss says that general decline in usage of commas is equally true in the UK, where it has been a slow, steady trend for at least a century:\n\nDuring the Second World War, the British carried the comma over into abbreviations. Specifically, \"Special Operations, Executive\" was written \"S.O.,E.\". Nowadays, even the full stops are frequently discarded.\n\nPunctuation has been added to many languages which originally developed without it, including a number of different comma forms. European languages like German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese use the same comma as English with similar spacing, though usage may be somewhat different. For instance, in Standard German, subordinate clauses are always preceded by commas.\nModern Greek uses the same Unicode comma for its \"kómma\" () and it is officially romanized as a Latin comma, but it has additional roles owing to its conflation with the former hypodiastole, a curved interpunct used to disambiguate certain homonyms. The comma therefore functions as a silent letter in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing (\"ó,ti\", \"whatever\") from (\"óti\", \"that\").\n\nThe enumeration or ideographic comma——is used in Chinese, Japanese punctuation, and somewhat in Korean punctuation. In the People's Republic of China and in North/South Korea, this comma ( ,  ,  \"dùnhào\") is usually used only to separate items in lists, while in Japan it is the more common form of comma (,  \"tōten\",  \"clause mark\"). In documents that mix Japanese and Latin scripts, the full-width comma () is used; this is the standard form of comma ( ,  ,  \"dòuhào\") in China. Since East Asian typography permits commas to join clauses dealing with certain topics or lines of thought, commas may separate subjects and predicates and constructions that would be considered a \"comma splice\" in English are acceptable and commonly encountered.\n\nKorean punctuation uses both commas and interpuncts for lists.\n\nIn Unicode 5.2.0 \"numbers with commas\" ( through ) were added to the Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement block for compatibility with the ARIB STD B24 character set.\n\nThe comma in the Arabic script (used by Arabic, Urdu, and Persian, etc.) is inverted, upside-down: \" (), in order to distinguish it from the Arabic diacritic \"\" (), representing the vowel , which is similarly comma-shaped. In Arabic texts, Western-styled comma () is used as a decimal point.\n\nReversed comma () is used in Sindhi when written in Arabic script. It is different from the standard Arabic comma.\n\nHebrew script is also written from right to left. However, Hebrew punctuation includes only a regular comma ().\n\nDravidian languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam also use the punctuation mark in similar usage to that of European languages with similar spacing.\n\nIn the common character encoding systems Unicode and ASCII, character 44 (0x2C) corresponds to the comma symbol. The HTML numeric character reference is codice_1.\n\nIn many computer languages commas are used as a field delimiter to separate arguments to a function, to separate elements in a list, and to perform data designation on multiple variables at once.\n\nIn the C programming language the comma symbol is an operator which evaluates its first argument (which may have side-effects) and then returns the value of its evaluated second argument. This is useful in \"for\" statements and macros.\n\nIn Smalltalk, the comma operator is used to concatenate collections, including strings.\n\nIn Prolog, the comma is used to denote Logical Conjunction (\"and\").\n\nThe comma-separated values (CSV) format is very commonly used in exchanging text data between database and spreadsheet formats.\n\nThe comma is used as a diacritic mark in Romanian under the \"s\" (\"Ș\", \"ș\"), and under the \"t\" (\"Ț\", \"ț\"). A cedilla is occasionally used instead of it, but this is technically incorrect. The symbol \"d̦\" (\"d\" with comma below) was used as part of the Romanian transitional alphabet (19th century) to indicate the sounds denoted by the Latin letter \"z\" or letters \"dz\", where derived from a Cyrillic \"ѕ\" (). The comma and the cedilla are both derivative of a small cursive \"z\" (ʒ) placed below the letter. From this standpoint alone, \"ș\", \"ț\", and \"d̦\" could potentially be regarded as stand-ins for \"sz\", \"tz\", and \"dz\" respectively.\n\nIn Latvian, the comma is used on the letters \"ģ\", \"ķ\", \"ļ\", \"ņ\", and historically also \"ŗ\", to indicate palatalization. Because the lowercase letter \"g\" has a descender, the comma is rotated 180° and placed over the letter. Although their Adobe glyph names are commas, their names in the Unicode Standard are \"g\", \"k\", \"l\", \"n\", and \"r\" with a cedilla. They were introduced to the Unicode standard before 1992, and their name cannot be altered.\n\nIn Livonian, whose alphabet is based on a mixture of Latvian and Estonian alphabets, the comma is used on the letters \"ḑ\", \"ļ\", \"ņ\", \"ŗ\", \"ț\" to indicate palatalization in the same fashion as Latvian, except that Livonian uses \"ḑ\" and \"ț\" represent the same palatal plosive phonemes which Latvian writes as \"ģ\" and \"ķ\" respectively.\n\nIn Czech and Slovak, the diacritic in the characters \"ď\", \"ť\", and \"ľ\" resembles a superscript comma, but it is used instead of a caron because the letter has an ascender. Other ascender letters with carons, such as letters \"ȟ\" (used in Finnish Romani and Lakota) and \"ǩ\" (used in Skolt Sami), did not modify their carons to superscript commas.\n\nIn 16th-century Guatemala, the archaic letter cuatrillo with a comma (Ꜯ, ꜯ) was used to write Mayan languages.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2088106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088106", "title": "Commutation test", "text": "Commutation test\n\nIn semiotics, the commutation test is used to analyze a signifying system. The test identifies signifiers as well as their signifieds, value and significance.\n\nThis test is a metalingual subjective system for analysing textual or other material. It has evolved from a limited method for investigating the structure of individual signs (per Roman Jakobson). Its primary uses are to: \nThe initial assumption is that the communication to be analysed represents both a cognitive use of the sign system and a statement that refers to the values of the addresser. The purpose of the test is therefore to illuminate the addresser's intention in using the code in this particular way. It works through a process of substitution, assessing the extent to which a change in the signifier leads to a change in the signified. The first step, therefore, is to exclude one signifier from the material to be analysed. This is a test of redundancy: to identify what meaning is lost (if any) by omitting that sign. It will be relatively unusual to find that one sign is completely superfluous, but more common to find that the contribution of the one sign to the whole meaning is relatively weak. The weakness or strength of its contribution can be calibrated more exactly by placing alternate (synonymous and antonymous) signs in the context. This will enable the analyst to make a judgment on the distinctiveness of the particular signifier chosen by the author/artist and of its value to the meaning, i.e. as more or less necessary for maintaining the meaning and/or rule structure in different occurrences. By changing the collocation between two of the existing signifiers, and so changing their original relationship, the relative significance of each signifier can be considered. Further, by also placing the original sign into different contexts, it can be seen whether the sign becomes more or less distinctive.\n\nThe nature of the process will be determined by the form of the media to be analysed. In textual or pictorial media where individuals are the theme of the content, this might involve a substitution of words that are synonymous, or of imagery parallel in classes representing age, gender, ethnicity, religion, ability, etc. to assess the extent to which overall meaning is affected. In visual media generally, substituting different mise en scènes or backgrounds may change the significance of objects or people in the foreground. Colour selections may affect the perceived attractiveness of the scene or of individuals whose clothing is changed. The presence or absence of branded or generic goods, of stylish or outmoded clothing, etc. may help to suggest the contribution of the original signifier.\n\nAccording to Daniel Chandler, the commutation test may involve any of four basic transformations which, to a greater or lesser extent, involve modification of the syntagm:\n\nTake the phrase:\nNow substitute \"boy\" with \"baby\", \"girl\", \"child\", \"pansy\", \"thief\". Each of these alternatives affects the implication of the phrase. A \"man\" rather than a father or parent randomly striking a baby or girl might be considered sexist and a crime. If the boy was a thief, this would explain but not excuse the man's behaviour as retaliation or revenge. If the boy is a pansy which has pejorative connotations of cowardice or homosexuality, the man may be intolerant or overly judgemental but the victim is also presented in a less sympathetic way. The use of child not differentiated by gender is a more common usage in the context of paedophilia. When the signifiers of boy and man are transposed, the relative inequality in strength is also reversed and the interpretation shifts to more playful and less threatening images. Hence, the subjective view may be that the phrase as originally conceived was the most neutral of the possible formulations given the original form. \n\nIf we now contextualise the image in a school, seminary, prison, training gym or home environment different sets of meanings emerge depending on the presence or absence of other signifiers demonstrating the relationship between the protagonists, the time the image was created (a Victorian image of corporal punishment in a school would have a different significance from a more recent image of judicial caning in Britain, Canada or Singapore), the nature of the activity (e.g. a boxing training session or a game of tennis in which the blow is struck accidentally, etc.), the presence or absence of other people, etc.. The values are therefore added or subtracted according to the presence or absence of other signifiers.\n\nThe first stage of development in semiotics related to the spoken and/or written form of language. Later, it was expanded to cover all sign systems that have an informational content. As Umberto Eco says, \"A sign is everything which can be taken as significantly substituting for something else.\" (1976)\n\nSemiotics studies the relationship between the form of the sign (the \"signifier\") and the meaning expressed (the \"signified\"), and thereby attempts to reveal the process of communicating understanding. In each case, a message is to be sent by an addresser to an addressee. For this to occur, the addresser and addressee must use a common code, Hence, language evolves dynamically. The community will identify a lexical thing that needs to be referred to in their language. By common agreement, a sign (sometimes called a \"signal\") will be selected. Of the many possible shades of meanings that it can be used to convey, one or more will be selected and \"encoded\", i.e. the chosen meaning(s) will be denoted or associated with the sign within the broader framework of syntactic and semantic systems available within the community. When the audience is exposed to the sign, the expectation is that they will be able to decode the meaning. As Roman Jakobson adds, there will also be an emotional element or value which represents the addresser's attitude towards the \"thing\". This will either become a connotative meaning attached directly to the sign itself, or it will be communicated by the context in which the sign is used by the addresser. \n\nIn lexicography, the fact that a neologism is used marks its acceptance into the language. This will not be a difficult process so long as each sign has a limited and immediately useful meaning. The problem arises when several possible meanings or shades of meaning become associated with the sign. This is a shift from denotational to connotational meanings. Rules of interpretation are required to resolve uncertainty. Within the community, such rules are, for the most part, experiential and applied without conscious control. Members of a community have a shared memory of language patterns and norms which, for the most part, are stable over long periods of time. Individuals are therefore able to build up a cognitive framework which identifies the possible meanings from any grouping of signs and selects one considered the most appropriate from the context. This intuitive system is continuously tested through the audience's responses. If the responses are satisfying, intuition prevails. If the responses are obviously inappropriate, the audience will consciously review the thought process and decide whether to modify the framework. Semiotics has developed a more precise methodology for this interpretive process, seeking to expose the unstated habitual practices for interpreting signifiers.\n\n"}

Although it is possible to sue law enforcement officials for false arrest, the usual defendants in such cases are private security firms.\n\nAfter an arrest, if the charges are dropped, a person will sometimes file legal action or a complaint against the appropriate arresting agency.\nIn most jurisdictions, the arrest powers of police and police agents are in excess of those afforded to ordinary citizens (see citizen's arrest). However, the powers of police officers to arrest are not unlimited. Generally speaking:\n\n\nMost cases of false arrest involve accusations of shoplifting, and are brought against security guards and retail stores. A guard cannot arrest someone merely on the suspicion that person is going to commit a theft. In most jurisdictions, there must be some proof that a criminal act has \"actually\" been committed. For example, a guard does not have reasonable and probable cause if a shopper has not yet paid for merchandise they are carrying in the belief that the person intends to leave without making payment. Instead, there must be an actual act committedthe person \"must\" make an actual attempt to leave the store without paying for the merchandise.\n\nIn the United States and other jurisdictions, police officers and other government officials are liable for clear deprivation of rights, but are partially shielded from false arrest lawsuits through the doctrine of qualified immunity, when such a violation qualifies as \"not obvious,\" by a US Supreme Court test. This doctrine can protect officials from liability when engaged in legal grey areas including qualifying discretionary actions in the arrests of suspects. However, the officer's actions must still not violate \"clearly established law,\" or this protection is void. This includes executing an arrest warrant against the wrong person. False statements by public servants to justify or cover up an illegal arrest are another violation of federal law.\n\nAn example of this doctrine being tested is Sorrell v. McGuigan (4th Cir. 2002). A police officer (McGuigan) detained a man shopping at a mall (Sorrell) based on the description of a suspect who had committed a theft at a store nearby, and proceeded to do a routine search for weapons. The store owner who reported the theft arrived at the scene and stated Sorrell and his friends were not the ones who had stolen from him. However, the officer still arrested Sorrell for possession of a concealed weapon, because he was carrying a folding knife with a 3 inch long blade in his pocket. In Maryland, non-automatic folding knives are not considered weapons under state law regardless of their length, and the lack of length limit had been upheld multiple times in the state's highest court. However, the officer erroneously believed the knife to be a weapon. Sorrell was released immediately after booking and was never prosecuted as there was technically no crime, and sued the police officer for false arrest. The officer's qualified immunity was denied by the court, and this decision was upheld in the US Court of Appeals.\n\nBounty hunters have been subject to suits for false arrest after attempting to execute bench warrants outside of the United States—where they have no extra powers beyond those of ordinary citizens and only police officers may execute warrants. In at least two prominent cases, bounty hunters were charged with kidnapping after taking custody of a bail jumper outside of the United States and bringing them back to the court that issued the warrant. One of them, Daniel Kear, was extradited from the US and convicted.\n\nThere have been some cases where police officers or bounty hunters have executed valid arrest warrants against the wrong person. Although many false arrest suits result in only nominal damages, such mistakes usually result in large awards against the arresting officers.\n\nIndividuals who realize that they are the target of false arrest might attempt to resist or flee. A few jurisdictions (i.e., 14 U.S. states, ) recognize the target's right of self-defense so as to resist unlawful arrest. Typically, this \"only\" applies when:\n\nIn such jurisdictions – and under the narrowly-defined circumstances described above – resisting unlawful arrest may be used as a justification for such resistance where it would otherwise be a crime (i.e. resisting arrest, flight to avoid prosecution, assault, etc). There are rare cases in which a murder charge had been reduced to manslaughter for this reason.\n\nJustification for such action is often hard to prove in court, and only justified in certain circumstances. Simple mistake of fact situations would generally not warrant attempting to elude law enforcement. However, there are some that would, such as:\n\n"}

{"id": "165458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165458", "title": "Handshake", "text": "Handshake\n\nA handshake is a globally widespread, brief greeting or parting tradition in which two people grasp one of each other's like hands, in most cases accompanied by a brief up-and-down movement of the grasped hands.\n\nUsing the right hand is generally considered proper etiquette. Customs surrounding handshakes are specific to cultures. Different cultures may be more or less likely to shake hands, or there may be different customs about how or when to shake hands.\n\nArchaeological ruins and ancient texts show that handshaking – also known as dexiosis – was practiced in ancient Greece as far back as the 5th century BC; a depiction of two soldiers shaking hands can be found on part of a 5th-century BC funerary stele on display in the Pergamon Museum, Berlin (stele SK1708) and other funerary steles like the one of the 4th century BC which depicts Thraseas and his wife Euandria handshaking (see images on the right). The handshake is believed by some to have originated as a gesture of peace by demonstrating that the hand holds no weapon. Meanwhile, Muslim scholars tell that custom of handshaking was introduced by the people of Yemen.\n\nThere are various customs surrounding handshakes, both generically and specific to certain cultures:\n\nThe handshake is commonly done upon meeting, greeting, parting, offering congratulations, expressing gratitude, or completing an agreement. In sports or other competitive activities, it is also done as a sign of good sportsmanship. Its purpose is to convey trust, respect, balance, and equality. If it is done to form an agreement, the agreement is not official until the hands are parted.\n\nUnless health issues or local customs dictate otherwise, usually a handshake is made with bare hands. However, it depends on the situation.\n\n\nHandshakes are known to spread a number of microbial pathogens. Certain diseases such as scabies are known to spread the most through direct skin-to-skin contact. A medical study has found that fist bumps and high fives spread fewer germs than handshakes.\n\nIn light of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the dean of medicine at the University of Calgary, Tomas Feasby, suggested that fist bumps may be a \"nice replacement of the handshake\" in an effort to prevent transmission of the virus.\n\nFollowing a 2010 study that showed that only about 40% of doctors and other health care providers complied with hand hygiene rules in hospitals, Mark Sklansky, a doctor at UCLA hospital, decided to test a \"a handshake-free zone\" as a method for limiting the spread of germs and reducing the transmission of disease. However, UCLA didn’t allow the ban of the handshakes outright, but they rather suggested other options like fist bumping, smiling, bowing, waving, and non-contact Namaste gestures.\n\nIt has been discovered as a part of a research in the Weizmann Institute, that human handshakes serve as a means of transferring social chemical signals between the shakers. \nIt appears that there is a tendency to bring the shaken hands to the vicinity of the nose and smell them. They may serve an evolutionary need to learn about the person whose hand was shaken, replacing a more overt sniffing behavior, as is common among animals and in certain human cultures (such as Tuvalu, Greenland or rural Mongolia, where a quick sniff is part of the traditional greeting ritual).\n\nAtlantic City, New Jersey Mayor Joseph Lazarow was recognized by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for a July 1977 publicity stunt, in which the mayor shook more than 11,000 hands in a single day, breaking the record previously held by President Theodore Roosevelt, who had set the record with 8,510 handshakes at a White House reception on 1 January 1907. This had already been broken, in 1963, by Lance Dowson in Wrexham, N. Wales who shook 12,500 individuals hands in 10 1/2 hours. This was recognised by the Guinness World Records Organisation and published in their 1964 publication. WSAI DJ Jim Scott broke the record at Northgate Mall, Cincinnati, Oh . On 31 August 1987 Stephen Potter from St Albans Round table shook 19,550 hands at the St Albans Carnival to take the World record for shaking most hands verified by the Guinness Book of records. The record has since been exceeded but has been retired from the book. Stephen Potter still holds the British and European record.\n\nOn August 15, 2008 Kirk Williamson and Richard McCulley broke the Guinness Book's World Record for the World's Longest Handshake (single hand) when they met at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii and shook hands for 10 hours besting the previous record of 9 hours and 19 minutes set in 2006 On 21 September 2009, Jack Tsonis and Lindsay Morrison then broke that record by shaking hands for 12 hours, 34 minutes and 56 seconds. Their record was broken less than a month later in Claremont, California, when John-Clark Levin and George Posner shook hands for 15 hours, 15 minutes, and 15 seconds. The next month, on 21 November, Matthew Rosen and Joe Ackerman surpassed this feat, with a new world record time of 15 hours, 30 minutes and 45 seconds certified in the latest edition of the Guinness Book of Records on page 111. At 8 pm EST on Friday 14 January 2011 the latest attempt at the longest hand-shake commenced in New York Times Square and the existing record was smashed by semi-professional world record-breaker Alastair Galpin and Don Purdon from New Zealand and Nepalese brothers Rohit and Santosh Timilsina who agreed to share the new record after 33 hours and 3 minutes.\n\nIn June 2016, an Algerian woman married to a Frenchman took part in a naturalization ceremony (cérémonie d’accueil dans la citoyenneté française) in the Département where the couple lives. She refused to give a handshake to the prefect and to a local representative and claimed her religious faith would ban her from touching foreign men. Thereupon, she did not receive the French nationality. On 20 April 2017, Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve signed a decree approving that decision. The Algerian woman filed a suit. On 11 April 2018, the Conseil d'État approved the decree.\n\n"}
{"id": "36720854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36720854", "title": "Henryka Łazowertówna", "text": "Henryka Łazowertówna\n\nHenryka Łazowertówna (; \"in full\" Henryka Wanda Łazowertówna); \"also\" Henryka Lazowert, or incorrectly Lazawert, (June 19, 1909, Warsaw – August 1942, Treblinka extermination camp) was a Polish lyric poet. While in general deeply personal in nature and of great emotive intensity, her poetry is not devoid of social concerns and patriotic overtones. She is considered one of the eminent Polish authors of Jewish descent.\n\nTo the reading public she is best known as the author of the famous poem \"Mały szmugler\" (The Little Smuggler), written in the Warsaw Ghetto \"c.\"1941 and first published posthumously in 1947. The poem deals with the subject of a child struggling single-handedly to keep his family alive in the Ghetto by smuggling provisions from the \"Aryan\" side at the risk of his own life. A poem begins with the stanza also known from an adaptive translation provided by Richard C. Lukas. It reads as follows:\nThe original text of the poem, together with translations in English and in Hebrew, is today inscribed on the Memorial to the Child Victims of the Holocaust ( in Warsaw), serving as the epitaph for the million children murdered in the Holocaust.\n\nHenryka Łazowertówna was the daughter of Maksymilian Łazowert and his wife Bluma. Her mother was a schoolteacher. Łazowertówna studied Polish and Romance philology at the University of Warsaw, and subsequently French literature at the University of Grenoble on a scholarship funded by the Polish interwar Government.\n\nShe was a very active member of the Warsaw section of the Polish Writers' Union, participating in the events organized by the institution, such as for example the conference commemorating the 10th anniversary of the death of the writer Stefan Żeromski in December 1935, an event during which she read from her works alongside such famous poets as Czesław Miłosz, Juljan Tuwim, and Kazimierz Wierzyński. Among the literary magazines of the day Łazowertówna collaborated principally with the literary journals \"Droga\" and \"Pion\". She was seen as being poetically close to the Skamander circle, publishing in her short life of 33 years two collections of poetry, \"Zamknięty pokój\" (\"A Closed Room\"), in which the Closed Room of the title poem is self-avowedly a metaphor for the person of the poet herself, and \"Imiona świata\" (\"The Names the World is Known By\"), whose programmatic poem fulfills the poet's promise of the earlier collection to sound a voice uniquely her own among the women poets of the interbellum period. \"Zamknięty pokój\" (\"A Closed Room\") was – in the words of the writer and a stern literary critic Karol Wiktor Zawodziński (18901949) – a manifestation of a particularly subtile poetic talent and an extraordinary intelligence, both struggling to break free of the magic circle of subjectivism and onto the rough and tough ferment of the world (\"zamęt życia\").\n\nPolitically speaking, Henryka Łazowertówna was known for her left-wing sympathies, a point on which she differed – in the opinion of Józef Łobodowski – from another famous poet of her generation, Zuzanna Ginczanka. However, her leftism was a condition of her sensitivity to social injustice and her moral rejection of all forms of oppression rather than an outcome of a political ideology. In contradistinction to Lucjan Szenwald, her contemporary, she remained fundamentally a lyric poet to the end.\n\nAlso unlike Ginczanka Łazowertówna was not a woman of extraordinary physical beauty, but she possessed charm and grace which, coupled with her simplicity of demeanour and straightforward attitude, made her in the eyes of those who knew her personally the embodiment of femininity. A certain simplicity and straightforwardness of style characterizes also her poetry. Łazowertówna never tried to project herself as other than she was. She lived in Warsaw with her mother in the ulica Sienna. She loved books, which she bought at a considerable harm to her meagre budget rather than using libraries because, as she explained, \"when I tackle a book I do not part with it until I am finished, reading at meals, in bed... The book is with me at all times, I do not take a single step away from it, and such close companionship is possible only where a book does not repulse by its physical appearance [\"sc.\" as many library books do]. I do prefer to read a book untouched by the hands of others, to cut the pages, to rejoice in the peculiar fragrance of the printer's ink.\"\n\nBiographer Eugenia Prokop-Janiec of Jagiellonian University asserts that it is the active antisemitism of the Polish society (\"Gazeta Warszawska\") in the 1930s that ultimately forced the writers and poets like Henryka Łazowertówna who never espoused any particular aspect of specifically Jewish identity while working in the Polish language, to align themselves with the Jewish community for the first time during either the Interbellum or the Second World War. Indeed, the hostility obtaining between the Jewish and non-Jewish communities in Poland receives an eloquent treatment in Łazowertówna's own fictional short story \"Wrogowie\" (\"The Enemies\"), published in 1938 – sixteen months before the outbreak of the Second World War – where she tells the story of two child hawkers of pretzels, the one Jewish the other Gentile, who with great animosity towards each other aggressively compete for custom until common misfortune counsels them to join forces in the cause of common good (see Works in Prose).\n\nOther established Jewish writers enjoyed the utmost prestige in the country, such as Bolesław Leśmian, Julian Tuwim, Antoni Słonimski as well as other Jewish members and celebrated recipients of the Golden Laurel from the Polish Academy of Literature (PAL), thus making Łazowertówna's biography somewhat unusual.\n\nDuring the Nazi Germany's Invasion of Poland in September 1939 part of Łazowertówna's Warsaw apartment in the ulica Sienna, which she shared with her mother, was destroyed in the strategic bombing conducted by the Luftwaffe, but it was found possible to make the remaining quarters habitable again. (Łazowertówna's father had died of natural causes before the War.)\n\nA year after the outbreak of the Second World War Henryka Łazowertówna found herself suddenly interned in the Warsaw Ghetto, like other residents of Jewish origin in the city, though without forced resettlement the ulica Sienna of her residence having been simply encircled by the borders of the so-called \"Little Ghetto\" (of the Ghetto's two parts, the North Side and the South Side, this was the South Side). As observed by Władysław Smólski (1909–1986), who visited her often during the first year of the War, the drama unfolding around her proved for Łazowertówna an opportunity to rise to the occasion displaying unhoped-for reserves of determination and strength. She immediately began collaboration with the Jewish charitable organization CENTOS whose mission was the care for orphan­ed or homeless children. Here she was recruited by Emanuel Ringelblum as a worker at his social-aid organization, the Żydowska Samopomoc Społeczna or \"Aleynhilf\". Her duties were those of a copy-writer for the various \"ad hoc\" utilitarian publications of that charitable institution (information leaflets, appeals for donations, etc.).\n\nShe was subsequently recruited by Ringelblum to staff the Oyneg Shabbos Archives also known as the Emanuel Ringelblum Archives in the UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme's Memory of the World Register where she distinguished herself in her work documenting the tragic vicissitudes of fate of refugees from various parts of Poland, having been praised by Ringelblum for her remarkable ability to bring to life and instill with vivid actuality the dry statistical facts recorded for the posterity by the organization about individual human beings.<ref name=\"Kassow181/2\">Samuel D. Kassow, \"Who will Write Our History?: Emanuel Ringelblum, the Warsaw Ghetto, and the Oyneg Shabes Archive\", Bloomington (Indiana), Indiana University Press, 2007, pp. 181182. , .</ref>\n\nIn the Ghetto she continued to write poetry. Apart from the testimony to the realities of Ghetto life memorialized in the famous poem \"Mały szmugler\" (The Little Smuggler), there also survives (preserved in the Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature of Warsaw) the letter of Łazowertówna addressed to the poet Roman Kołoniecki (19061978) and dated September 6, 1941, a moving lyrical account of the Ghetto streets and the passersby to be encountered in them.\n\nŁazowertówna had apparently no illusions that she needed outside help in order to survive: already in February or March 1940 (\"i.e.\", many months before the creation of the Ghetto), she enlisted the services of Ludwik Brandstaetter, the father of the well-known writer Roman Brandstaetter, in approaching a mutual Polish poet-friend with a request for assistance with resettlement in Cracow, a city which she believed would offer her anonymity and hence greater security. One last (bitter) comment on the ultimate fate of Łazowertówna is offered by Emanuel Ringelblum himself:\n\nHowever, Władysław Smólski reports that when it became clear in the course of 1941 that the Ghetto would be eventually closed off from the outside world, many of Łazowertówna's friends counselled her to leave the precinct (together with her mother) while this was still possible, offering to find a safe house for the two of them. She apparently refused to do so, arguing that she was needed by the most unfortunate of beings, the children, orphaned or homeless, from whom she cared at the time.\n\nDuring the so-called \"Großaktion Warschau\", the mass deportations of the Warsaw Ghetto population to the Treblinka extermination camp conducted by the Nazis between July and September 1942, Henryka Łazowertówna of her own free will accompanied her mother to the Umschlagplatz or the railway loading-dock that served as a point of departure for the victims being sent to their deaths at Treblinka gas chambers some 84 kilometres to the north-east as the crow flies. The organization that employed her, the \"Aleynhilf\", attempted to rescue Łazowertówna from being included in the transport, but when she learned that she would have to leave her mother behind Łazowertówna declined the assistance being offered to her alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2789861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2789861", "title": "History of Modern Standard Chinese", "text": "History of Modern Standard Chinese\n\nMandarin, officially Modern Standard Chinese, is the official language used by the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Singapore.\n\nSince ancient history, the Chinese language has always consisted of a wide variety of dialects; hence prestige dialects and linguae francae have always been needed. Confucius, for example, used \"yǎyán\" (雅言), or \"elegant speech\", rather than colloquial regional dialects; text during the Han dynasty also referred to \"tōngyǔ\" (通語), or \"common language\". Rime dictionaries, which were written since the Southern and Northern Dynasties, may also have reflected one or more systems of standard pronunciation during those times. However, all of these standard dialects were probably unknown outside the educated elite; even among the elite, pronunciations may have been very different, as the unifying factor of all Chinese dialects, Classical Chinese, was a written standard, not a spoken one.\n\nThe Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties (1644–1912) began to use the term \"guānhuà\" (官話), or \"official speech\", to refer to the speech used at the courts. It seems that during the early part of this period, the standard was based on the Nanjing dialect, but later the Beijing dialect became increasingly influential, despite the mix of officials and commoners speaking various dialects in the capital, Beijing.\n\nThe existence of \"Guanhua\" became known to Europeans already by the time of Matteo Ricci (who worked in China in 1582-1610), who wrote of \"a spoken language common to the whole Empire, known as the Quonhua, an official language for civil and forensic use\".\n\nIn the 17th century, the Empire had set up Orthoepy Academies (正音書院, Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn) in an attempt to make pronunciation conform to the Beijing standard. But these attempts had little success. As late as the 19th century the emperor had difficulty understanding some of his own ministers in court, who did not always try to follow any standard pronunciation. As late as the early 20th century, the position of Nanjing Mandarin was considered higher than that of Beijing by some and the postal romanization standard set in 1906 included spellings with elements of Nanjing pronunciation. Nevertheless, by 1909, the dying Qing dynasty had established the Beijing dialect as \"guóyǔ\" (国语/國語), or the \"national language\".\n\nAfter the Republic of China was established in 1912, there was more success in promoting a common national language. A Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation was convened with delegates from the entire country, who were chosen based as often on political considerations as often as on linguistic expertise. The conference deadlocked between promoters of northern and southern pronunciation standards and as a result, a compromise was produced. The \"Dictionary of National Pronunciation\" (國音詞典) was published, which was based on the Beijing dialect, but with added features, such as a fifth tone, believed to be more faithful to historical Chinese pronunciation. Meanwhile, colloquial literature continued to develop apace vernacular Chinese, despite the lack of a standardized pronunciation. Gradually, the members of the National Language Commission came to settle upon the Beijing dialect which became the major source of standard national pronunciation, due to the status of that dialect as a prestigious dialect. In 1932, the commission published the \"Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use\" (國音常用. 字彙), with little fanfare or official pronunciation. This dictionary was similar to the previous published one, now known as the Old National Pronunciation (老國音), except that it normalized the pronunciations for all characters into the pronunciation of the Beijing dialect. Despite efforts by some factions to recognize and promote southern Chinese varieties as well, the Kuomintang strongly promoted Guoyu as the one national language and censored and arrested opponents of this movement, continuing this through the wartime years. Elements from other dialects continue to exist in the standard language, but as exceptions rather than the rule.\n\nThe government of the People's Republic of China, established in 1949, continued the effort. In 1955, \"guóyǔ\" was renamed \"pǔtōnghuà\" (普通話), or \"common speech\". (The name change was not recognized by the Republic of China, which has governed only Taiwan and some surrounding islands since 1949.) Since then, the standards used in mainland China and Taiwan have diverged somewhat, though they continue to remain essentially identical.\n\nAfter the handovers of Hong Kong and Macau, the term \"Putonghua\" is used in those special administrative regions of China and pinyin is widely used for teaching of Putonghua.\n\nIn both mainland China and Taiwan, the use of Mandarin as the medium of instruction in the educational system and in the media has contributed to the spread of Mandarin. As a result, Mandarin is now spoken fluently by most people in mainland China and in Taiwan. However, in Hong Kong and Macau, due to historical and linguistic reasons, the language of education and both formal and informal speech remains Cantonese but Mandarin is becoming increasingly influential.\n\nHistorically, and properly speaking, the word \"Mandarin\" (官話) refers to the language spoken in the 19th century by the upper classes of Beijing as well as by the higher civil servants and military officers of the imperial regime serving in Beijing or in the provinces.\n\nThis Mandarin language is quite close to modern-day Mandarin (普通话 / 普通話/ 國語), but there exist some differences. The Mandarin language used many honorifics which have mostly disappeared in modern-day Mandarin daily speech, such as jiàn (賤 \"my humble\"), guì (貴 \"your honorable\"), bì (敝 \"my humble\"), etc.\n\nThe grammar of the Mandarin language was almost identical to the grammar of modern-day Mandarin, with sometimes very slight differences in the choice of grammatical words or the positioning of words in the sentence. The vocabulary of the Mandarin language was also largely the same as the vocabulary of modern-day Mandarin, although some vocabulary items have now disappeared.\n"}

Hitsuzendo is practised standing, using a large brush and ink, usually on newspaper roll. In this way, the whole body is used to guide the brush, in contrast to writing at a table.\n\nCalligraphy was brought to Japan from China and Chinese masters such as Wang Xizhi 王羲之 (Jp: Ou Gishi; 303-361) have had a profound influence, especially on the \"karayō\" style which is still practiced today. The indigenous Japanese \"wayō tradition\" (和様書道, wayō-shodō) only appeared towards the end of the Heian era. However, the calligraphy of Zen scholars was often more concerned with spiritual qualities and individual expression and shunned technicalities which led to unique and distinctly personal styles. Japanese calligraphy has three basic styles: Kaisho 楷書, Gyōsho 行書, and Sōsho 草書.\n\nTrue creativity is not the product of consciousness but rather the \"phenomenon of life itself.\" True creation must arise from mu-shin 無心, the state of \"no-mind,\" in which thought, emotions, and expectations do not matter. Truly skilful Zen calligraphy is not the product of intense \"practice;\" rather, it is best achieved as the product of the \"no-mind\" state, a high level of spirituality, and a heart free of disturbances.\n\nTo write Zen calligraphic characters that convey truly deep meaning, one must focus intensely and become one with the meaning of the characters they create. In order to do this, one must free one's mind and heart of disturbances and focus only on the meaning of the character. Becoming one with what you create, essentially, is the philosophy behind Zen Calligraphy and other Japanese arts.\n\n\n"}

Hillis Miller\n\nJoseph Hillis Miller Jr. (born March 5, 1928) is an American literary critic who has been heavily influenced by—and who has heavily influenced—deconstruction.\n\nHillis Miller was born in Newport News, Virginia. He is the son of J. Hillis Miller Sr., a Baptist minister, university professor and administrator who served as the president of the University of Florida. Miller graduated from Oberlin College (B.A. \"summa cum laude\", 1948) and Harvard University (M.A. 1949, Ph.D. 1952). Miller is married and has three children.\n\nMiller has been an important humanities and literature scholar specializing in Victorian and Modernist literature, with a keen interest in the ethics of reading and reading as a cultural act. From 1952 to 1972, Miller taught at Johns Hopkins University. During this time, Miller was heavily influenced by fellow Johns Hopkins professor and Belgian literary critic Georges Poulet and the Geneva School of literary criticism, which Miller characterized as \"the consciousness of the consciousness of another, the transposition of the mental universe of an author into the interior space of the critic's mind.\" \n\nIn 1972, he joined the faculty at Yale University where he taught for fourteen years. At Yale, he worked alongside prominent literary critics Paul de Man and Geoffrey Hartman, where they were collectively known as the Yale School of deconstruction, in contention with prominent Yale influence theorist Harold Bloom. As a prominent American deconstructionist, Miller defines the movement as searching for \"the thread in the text in question which will unravel it all,\" and cites that there are multiple layers to any text, both its clear surface and its deep countervailing subtext: On the one hand, the \"obvious and univocal reading\" always contains the \"deconstructive reading\" as a parasite encrypted within itself as part of itself. ON the other hand, the \"deconstructive\" reading can by no means free itself from the metaphysical reading it means to contest.\n\nIn 1986, Miller left Yale to work at the University of California Irvine, where he was later followed by his Yale colleague Jacques Derrida. During the same year he served as President of Modern Language Association, and was honored by the MLA with a lifetime achievement award in 2005. Both at Yale and UC Irvine, Miller mentored an entire generation of American literary critics including noted queer theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick.\n\nCurrently, he is Distinguished Research Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of California Irvine.\n\nMiller's \"The Critic as Host\" could be viewed as a reply to M.H. Abrams, who presented a paper, \"The Deconstructive Angel,\" at a session of the Modern Language Association in December 1976, criticizing deconstruction and the methods of Miller. Miller presented his paper just after Abrams's presentation at the same session.\n\nIn his essay \"The Deconstructive Angel,\" Abrams argued that there is a fixed univocal meaning for a text and if we use deconstructive strategies History will become impossibility. Miller replied that univocal and determinate meaning is impossibility and history is also impossibility. Every text is a vocalization of a vocalization. \n\nMiller asks a vital question at the beginning of his essay: when a text contains a citation from another text, is it like a parasite in the main text or is it the main text that surrounds and strangles the citation? Many people tend to see the deconstructionist reading as a parasite on its host, the univocal reading. Miller argues that deconstructionist reading is an essential and thoroughly naturalized ingredient in every reading, such that we cannot identify its presence. \n\nThe word 'parasite' evokes the image of an ivy tree, the deconstructive reading that feeds on a mighty masculine oak, the univocal reading, and finally destroys the host. Miller rejects this view and calls this image inappropriate. Deconstructive reading is an essential and naturalized ingredient of every reading that we cannot identify its presence. He undertakes a brilliant etymological investigation of the word 'parasite' to prove his critics wrong. \n\nThe word 'parasite' contains within itself its opposite. The prefix 'para' in the word parasite has many contradictory meanings. It simultaneously signifies proximity and distance. The word 'parasite' originated etymologically from the Greek 'parasitos'. The root means 'beside the grain'. 'Para' means beside and 'sitos' means grain or food. Originally 'parasite' was something positive. It simply meant someone who shares food with you, a fellow guest. \n\nThe word 'host' has a more complex derivation. It meant a guest and a stranger, a friend with whom you have a reciprocal duty of hospitality, and a stranger and an enemy, and of course the holy Host. Miller shows that each word has a reciprocal, antithetical meaning built in, that these words are all intertwined in their etymology. \n\nThe antithetical nature of the words 'host' and 'guest' shows the great complexity and equivocal richness of the apparently obvious and univocal language. The complexity and equivocal richness resides in the fact that language is basically figurative and metaphorical and hence it cannot represent reality directly and immediately. Deconstruction is an investigation of what is implied by this inherence of figure, concept and narrative in one another. Deconstruction is, therefore, a rhetorical discipline. \n\nThere is a common view that a poem has a true original univocal reading and the secondary or the deconstructive reading is always parasitical on the first one. Miller, however, claims that there is no difference between both these readings. In his conception there is the poem and its various readings, all of which are equally valid or non-valid. The poem is the food and the two readings, both univocal and equivocal, are fellow guests near the food. Thus we get a triangular relation between the poem and its two readings, or the relation could be like a chain without a beginning or an end. \n\nMiller argues that an obvious univocal reading in the conventional sense is a myth. There is only deconstructive reading and it generates new meanings. The poem invites endless sequence of commentaries, which never arrives at a ‘correct’ or final reading and meaning. Harold Bloom has formed a concept of the anxiety of influence to clarify the indebtedness of poets of a generation to the older generations. No poem can stand on its own, but always in relation to another. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the relationship between two successive syllables in speech. A juncture is, formally, a suprasegmental phonemic cue, a means by which a listener can distinguish between two otherwise identical sequences of sounds that have different meanings.\n\nThere are several kinds of juncture, the most widely used typology of which is:\n\nOther less common typologies exist, such as the division (favoured by American Structuralist linguists in the middle twentieth century) into plus, single bar, double bar, and double cross junctures, denoted , , , and respectively. These correspond to syllabification and differences in intonation, single bar being a level pitch before a break, double bar being an upturn in pitch and a break, and double cross being a downturn in pitch that usually comes at the end of an utterance.\n\nIn English, a syllable break at the plus juncture sometimes distinguishes otherwise homophonic phrases.\n\n\nA word boundary preceded or followed by a syllable break is called an \"external open juncture\". If there is no break, so that words on either side of the juncture are run together, the boundary is called an \"internal open juncture\".\n\nThe distinction between open and close juncture is the difference between \"night rate\", with the open juncture between and , and \"nitrate\", with close juncture between and . In some varieties of English, only the latter involves an affricate.\n\nIn recreational linguistics, an \"oronym\" is a pair of phrases which are homophonic. When pronounced without a pause between words (internal open juncture), phrases which differ in meaning and spelling may share a similar pronunciation. An example is \"ice cream\" and \"I scream\" (which is employed in the chant \"I scream; you scream; we all scream for ice cream\" that is familiar to many English-speaking children.). The label \"oronym\" was suggested by Gyles Brandreth and first published in his book \"The Joy of Lex\" (1980).\n\"The Two Ronnies\" comedy sketch \"Four Candles\" is entirely built around oronyms, including a taciturn customer's request for \"fork handles\" being misheard as \"four candles.\"\n\nAn older meaning of the word \"oronym\", used in the context of topographical nomenclature, is: toponym of a mountain.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5144247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5144247", "title": "Languages of Ireland", "text": "Languages of Ireland\n\nThere are a number of languages used in Ireland. Since the late eighteenth century, English has been the predominant first language, displacing Irish. A large minority claims some ability to use Irish, and it is the first language for a small percentage of the population.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, under the Constitution of Ireland, both languages have official status, with Irish being the national and first official language. Northern Ireland has no official language, but English is the \"de facto\" official language of the United Kingdom and Irish and Ulster-Scots are recognised regional languages.\nThe earliest linguistic records in Ireland are of Primitive Irish, from about the 5th century AD. Languages spoken in Iron Age Ireland before then are now irretrievable, although there are some claims of traces in Irish toponymy.\n\nMiddle English was first introduced by the Cambro-Norman settlers in the 12th century. It did not initially take hold as a widely spoken language, as the Norman élite spoke Anglo-Norman. In time, many Norman settlers intermarried and assimilated to the Irish cultures and some even became \"more Irish than the Irish themselves\". Following the Tudor conquest of Ireland and the 1610–15 Ulster Plantation, particularly in the old Pale, Elizabethan English became the language of court, justice, administration, business, trade and of the landed gentry. Monolingual Irish speakers were generally of the poorer and less educated classes with no land. Irish was accepted as a vernacular language, but then as now, fluency in English was an essential element for those who wanted social mobility and personal advancement. After the legislative Union of Great Britain and Ireland's succession of Irish Education Acts that sponsored the Irish national schools and provided free public primary education, Hiberno-English replaced the Irish language. Since the 1850s, English medium education was promoted by both the UK administration and the Roman Catholic Church. This greatly assisted the waves of immigrants forced to seek new lives in the US and throughout the Empire after the Famine. Since then the various local Hiberno-English dialects comprise the vernacular language throughout the island.\n\nThe 2002 census found that 103,000 British citizens were living in the Republic of Ireland, along with 11,300 from the US and 8,900 from Nigeria, all of whom would speak other dialects of English. The 2006 census listed 165,000 people from Great Britain and 22,000 from the US.\n\nThe original Primitive Irish was introduced by Celtic speakers. Primitive Irish gradually evolved into Old Irish, spoken between the 5th and the 10th centuries, and then into Middle Irish. Middle Irish was spoken in Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of Man through the 12th century, when it began to evolve into modern Irish in Ireland, Scottish Gaelic in Scotland, and the Manx language in the Isle of Man. Today, Irish is recognised as the first official language of the Republic of Ireland and is officially recognised in Northern Ireland and in the European Union. Communities that speak Irish as their first language, generally in sporadic regions on the island's west coast, are collectively called the Gaeltacht. According to more detailed census data, in 2011, there has been an increase of 5,000 in the number of daily Irish speakers since the previous census. There are 77,185 daily speakers, a third of which are located in the Gaeltacht and the remaining 55,554 are located in the rest of the country as well as another estimated 109,663 weekly speakers.\n\nIn the over 80 years since the independence of the South, efforts to revive Irish as an active daily vernacular of most of the nation have relied on compulsion and have generally failed. More and more people are becoming passive speakers of Irish (who watch Irish-language TV, listen to Irish-language radio, read Irish-language newspapers and magazines) with an estimated 10% (400,000+) of the population of the Republic who would be classified as fluent, near fluent or reasonably good passive speakers.\n\nAlthough the use of Irish in educational and broadcasting contexts has soared with the 600 plus Irish-language primary/secondary schools and creches, English is still overwhelmingly dominant in almost all social, economic and cultural contexts. In the media, there is an Irish-language TV station TG4, Cúla 4 a children's channel on satellite, 5 radio stations such as the national station RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, Raidió na Life in Dublin, Raidió Fáilte in Belfast, Raidió na dTreabh in Galway as well as a youth radio station Raidió Rí-Rá. There are also several newspapers, such as Tuairisc.ie, Meon Eile, Seachtain a weekly supplement in the Irish Independent and a number of Magazines including Comhar, Feasta and An Timire. There are also occasional columns written in Irish in English-language newspapers, including The Irish Times, The Irish News, The Irish Examiner, Metro Éireann, Irish Echo, Evening Echo and Andersonstown News. All of the 40 or so radio stations in the Republic have to have some weekly Irish-language programming to obtain their broadcasting licence. Similarly, RTÉ runs Nuacht, a news show, in Irish and Léargas, a documentary show, in Irish with English subtitles. The Official Languages Act 2003 gave many new rights to Irish citizens with respect to the Irish language, including the use of Irish in court proceedings. All Dáil debates are to be recorded in Irish also. In 2007, Irish became the 21st official language of the European Union.\n\nUlster Scots sometimes called Ullans is a dialect of Scots spoken in some parts of County Donegal and Northern Ireland. It is promoted by the Ulster Scots Agency, a cross-border body. Its status as an independent language as opposed to a dialect of Scots has been debated.\n\nShelta is a cant, based upon both Irish and English, generally spoken by the Irish Traveller community. It is known as Gammon to Irish speakers and Shelta by the linguistic community. It is a mixture of English and Irish, with Irish being the lexifier language.\n\nShelta is a secret language, with a refusal by the Travellers to share with non-travellers, named \"Buffers\". When speaking Shelta in front of Buffers, Travellers will disguise the structure so as to make it seem like they aren't speaking Shelta at all. There is fear that if outsiders know the entirety of the language, it will be used to bring further discrimination to the Traveller community.\n\nIrish Sign Language (ISL) is the sign language of most of Ireland. It has little relation to either spoken Irish or English, and is more closely related to French Sign Language (LSF) than to British Sign Language (BSL).\n\nNorthern Ireland Sign Language is used in Northern Ireland, and is related to both ISL and BSL in various ways. ISL is also used in Northern Ireland.\n\nWith increased immigration into Ireland, there has been a substantial increase in the number of people speaking languages. The table below gives figures from the 2011 census of population usually resident and present in the state who speak a language other than English, Irish or a sign language at home.\nNone of these languages were spoken by a majority of the population, but are of historical interest, giving loan words to Irish and Hiberno-English.\nLate Latin was introduced by the early Christians by c. 500. It remained a church language, but also was an official language after the Norman conquest in 1171. Ecclesiastical Latin was used by the Roman Catholic church for services until the Vatican II reforms in 1962–65. Latin is still used in a small number of churches in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Stamullen.\n\nNorman settlers introduced the Norman or Anglo-Norman language during the Norman invasion of Ireland of 1169. From it derived \"Law French\", that continues to be used today for certain legal purposes in both jurisdictions on the island.\n\nYola was a dialect of Middle English, surviving in County Wexford up to the 19th century.\n\nFingalian was similar to Yola but spoken in Fingal up until the mid-19th century.\n\nIn primary schools, most pupils are taught to speak, read and write in Irish and English. The vast majority of schools teach through English, although a growing number of \"gaelscoileanna\" teach through Irish and English. Most students at second level choose to study English as an L1 language and Irish and other Continental European languages as L2 languages. Irish is not offered as an L1 language by the Department of Education. Prof. David Little (November 2003) said that there was an urgent need to introduce an L1 Irish Gaelic Curriculum. He quoted from a report by An Bord Curaclaim agus Scrúduithe (The Curriculum and Examinations Board) Report of the Board of Studies for Languages, Dublin 1987: \"It must be stressed … that the needs of Irish as L1 at post-primary level have been totally ignored, as at present there is no recognition in terms of curriculum and syllabus of any linguistic differences between learners of Irish as L1 and L2.\". The Continental European languages available for the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate include French, German, Italian and Spanish; Leaving Certificate students can also study Arabic, Japanese and Russian. Some schools also offer Ancient Greek, Hebrew Studies and Latin at second level.\n\nStudents who did not immigrate to Ireland before the age of ten may receive an exemption from learning Irish. Pupils with learning difficulties can also seek exemption. A recent study has revealed that over half of those pupils who got exemption from studying Irish went on to study a Continental European language.\nThe following is a list of foreign languages taken at Leaving Certificate level in 2007, followed by the number as a percentage of all students taking Mathematics for comparison (mathematics is a mandatory subject).\nThe predominant language in the education system in Northern Ireland is English with the Irish Medium schools teaching exclusively in the Irish language. The ULTACH Trust coordinates the promotion of Irish in English Medium Schools, in the GCSE and A Level qualification it is the 3rd most picked Modern Language in the Northern Ireland and in the top ten in the UK. Intakes in GCSE Irish and A Level Irish are increasing, the usage of the language is also increasing.\n\n"}
{"id": "275049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275049", "title": "Languages of Pakistan", "text": "Languages of Pakistan\n\nPakistan is home to many dozens of languages spoken as first languages. Five languages have more than 10 million speakers each in Pakistan – Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, Saraiki and Urdu. Almost all of Pakistan's languages belong to the Indo-Iranian group of the Indo-European language family.\n\nPakistan's national language is Urdu, which, along with English, is also the official language.\n\nThe country also has several regional languages, including Punjabi, Saraiki, Pashto, Sindhi, Balochi, Kashmiri, Hindko, Brahui, Shina, Balti, Khowar, \nDhatki, Haryanvi, Marwari, Wakhi and Burushaski. Four of these are provincial languages – Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, and Balochi.\n\nThe number of individual languages listed for Pakistan is 74. All are living languages. Of these, 66 are indigenous and 8 are non-indigenous. Furthermore, 7 are 'institutional', 17 are 'developing', 39 are 'vigorous', 9 are 'in trouble', and 2 are 'dying'.\n\nFollowing are the major languages spoken in Pakistan, by number of people that speak them as their first language.\n\nUrdu () is the national language (), \"lingua franca\" and one of two official languages of Pakistan (the other currently being English). Although only about 8% of Pakistanis speak it as their first language, it is widely spoken and understood as a second language by the vast majority of Pakistanis and is being adopted increasingly as a first language by urbanized Pakistanis. It was introduced as the lingua franca upon the capitulation and annexation of Sindh (1843) and Punjab (1849) with the subsequent ban on the use of Persian. According to the linguistic historian Tariq Rahman, however, the oldest name of what is now called Urdu is Hindustani or Hindvi and it existed in some form at least from the 14th century if not earlier (Rahman 2011). It was probably the Indo-Aryan language of the area around Delhi that absorbed words of Persian, Arabic, and Chagatai (a Turkic language)—in a process like the one that created modern English. This language, according to Rahman, is the ancestor of both modern Hindi and Urdu. These became two distinct varieties when Urdu was first Persianized in the 18th century and then Hindi was Sanskritized from 1802 onwards.\n\nThe name Urdu is a short form of 'Zuban-e-Urdu-e-Mualla' i.e. language of the exalted city. In India the term Urdu, although it means 'military camp' in most Turkic languages, was used for the capital city of the king. In other words, the language of the king's capital was a Persianized form of the language known only by its previous and currently less common name Hindustani. This was shortened to 'Urdu' and this term was used for the first time in written records by the poet Mushafi in 1780 (Rahman 2011: 49). It is widely used, both formally and informally, for personal letters as well as public literature, in the literary sphere and in the popular media. It is a required subject of study in all primary and secondary schools. It is the first language of most Muhajirs (Muslim refugees who fled from different parts of India after independence of Pakistan in 1947), who form nearly 8% of Pakistan's population, and is an acquired second language for the rest. As Pakistan's national language, Urdu has been promoted to promote national unity. It is written with a modified form of the Perso-Arabic alphabet—usually in Nastaliq script.\n\nPunjabi (پنجابی) is spoken as a first language by more than 44% of Pakistanis, mostly in Punjab. Speakers of Saraiki and Hindko have previously been included in the Punjabi totals. The standard Punjabi variety is from the Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala and Sheikhupura districts and it is written in the Shahmukhi script with the Urdu alphabet.\n\nPashto (پښتو) is spoken as a first language by more than 15.42% (c. 29 million) of Pakistanis, mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and in northern Balochistan as well as in ethnic Pashtun communities in the cities of Karachi, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore. Karachi is one of the most Pashto speaking cities in the world. Pashto is also widely spoken in neighboring Afghanistan where it has official language status.\n\nPashto has rich written literary traditions as well as an oral tradition. There are three major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified; these are Pakhto, which is the Northern (Peshawar) variety, and the softer Pashto spoken in the southern areas. Khushal Khan Khattak (1613–1689) and Rahman Baba (1633–1708) were famous poets in the Pashto language. In the last part of 20th century, Pakhto or Pashto has produced some great poets like Ghani Khan, Khatir Afridi and Amir Hamza Shinwari. They are not included in the overall percentage.\n\nThe Sindhi language (سنڌي) is spoken as a first language by at most 14.5% of Pakistanis, mostly in Sindh province, parts of Balochistan, Southern Punjab and Balochistan. It has a rich literature and is taught in schools. It is an Indo-Aryan (Indo-European) language, derived from Sanskrit, and influenced by Arabic languages. The Arabs ruled Sindh province for more than 150 years after Muhammad bin Qasim conquered it in 712 AD, remaining there for three years to set up Arab rule. Consequently, the social fabric of Sindh contains elements of Arabic society. Sindhi is spoken by over 53.4 million people in Pakistan and some 5.8 million in India as well as some 2.6 million in other parts of the world. It is the official language of Sindh province and is one of the scheduled languages officially recognized by the federal government in India. It is widely spoken in the Lasbela District of Balochistan (where the Lasi tribe speaks a dialect of Sindhi), many areas of the Naseerabad, Rahim Yar Khan and Dera Ghazi Khan districts in Sindh and Jafarabad districts of Balochistan, and by the Sindhi diaspora abroad. Sindhi language has six major dialects: Sireli, Vicholi, Lari, Thari, Lasi and Kachhi. It is written in the Arabic script with several additional letters to accommodate special sounds. The largest Sindhi-speaking cities are Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Shikarpur, Dadu, Jacobabad, Larkana and Nawabshah. Sindhi literature is also spiritual in nature. Shah Abdul Latif Bhita'i (1689–1752) is one of its greatest poets; he wrote the famous poetic compendium \"Shah Jo Risalo\" which includes the folk stories \"Sassi Punnun\" and \"Umar Marvi\".\n\nBalochi (بلوچی) is spoken as a first language by about 4% of Pakistanis, mostly in Balochistan province. Rakshani is the major dialect group in terms of numbers. Sarhaddi is a sub-dialect of Rakshani. Other sub-dialects are Kalati (Qalati), Chagai-Kharani and Panjguri. Eastern Hill Balochi or Northern Balochi is very different from the rest. The name \"Balochi\" or \"Baluchi\" is not found before the 10th Century. It is one of the 9 distinguished languages of Pakistan. Since Balochi is a very poetic and rich language and has a certain degree of affinity to Urdu, Balochi poets tend to be very good poets in Urdu as well and Ata Shaad, Gul Khan Nasir and Noon Meem Danish are excellent examples of this.\n\nSaraiki (Sarā'īkī, also spelt Siraiki, or less often Seraiki) is an Indo-Aryan language of the Lahnda group, spoken in the south-western half of the province of Punjab. Saraiki is to a high degree mutually intelligible with Standard Punjabi and shares with it a large portion of its vocabulary and morphology. At the same time in its phonology it is radically different (particularly in the lack of tones, the preservation of the voiced aspirates and the development of implosive consonants), and has important grammatical features in common with the Sindhi language spoken to the south. Saraiki is the first language of about 20 million people in Pakistan, its territory ranges across southern Punjab, parts of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and some border regions of northern Sindh and eastern Balochistan.\n\nBrahui (براھوی) is a Dravidian language of central and east-central Balochistan. The language has been influenced by neighboring Balochi and to a lesser extent by Sindhi and Pashto. 1% of the Pakistani population has Brahui as their first language. It is one of the nine distinguished languages of Pakistan. The Brahui people have traditionally been taken as a relict population, suggesting that Dravidian languages were formerly more widespread but were supplanted by the incoming Indo-Aryan languages. However, this idea has fallen out of favor; Brahui appears to have migrated to Balochistan from central India after 1000 CE, as evidenced by the absence of Avestan loanwords. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western Iranian language like Kurdish that moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE.\n\nShina (شینا) (also known as Tshina) is a Dardic language spoken by a plurality of people in Gilgit–Baltistan of Pakistan. The valleys in which it is spoken include Astore, Chilas, Dareil, Tangeer, Gilgit, Ghizer, and a few parts of Kohistan. It is also spoken in the Gurez, Drass, Kargil, Karkit Badgam and Ladakh valleys of Kashmir. There were 321,000 speakers of Gilgiti Shina in 1981. The current estimate is nearly 600,000 people.\n\nKashmiri (كأشُر) is a Dardic language spoken in Azad Kashmir, about 124,000 speakers (or 2% of the Azad Kashmir population).\n\nEnglish is a co-official language of Pakistan and is widely used in the executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as to some extent in the officer ranks of Pakistan's armed forces. Pakistan's Constitution and laws were written in English and are now being re-written in the local languages. It is also widely used in schools, colleges and universities as a medium of instruction. English is seen as the language of upward mobility, and its use is becoming more prevalent in upper social circles, where it is often spoken alongside native Pakistani languages. In 2015, it was announced that there were plans to promote Urdu in official business, but Pakistan's Minister of Planning Ahsan Iqbal stated,\"Urdu will be a second medium of language and all official business will be bilingual.\" He also went on to say that English would be taught alongside Urdu in schools.\n\nIn the history, Arabic (عربي) was the official language when the territory of the modern state Islamic Republic of Pakistan was a part of the Umayyad Caliphate between 651 and 750.\n\nThe Arabic language is mentioned in the constitution of Pakistan. It declares in article 31 No. 2 that \"The State shall endeavour, as respects the Muslims of Pakistan (a) to make the teaching of the Holy Quran and Islamiat compulsory, to encourage and facilitate the learning of Arabic language ...\"\n\nArabic is the religious language of Muslims. The Quran, Sunnah, Hadith and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with Urdu translation. The Pakistani diaspora living in the Middle East has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Pakistan. Arabic is taught as a religious language in mosques, schools, colleges, universities and madrassahs. A majority of Pakistan's Muslim population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the Arabic language as part of their religious education.\n\nThe National Education Policy 2017 declares in article 3.7.4 that: “\"Arabic as compulsory part will be integrated in Islamiyat from Middle to Higher Secondary level to enable the students to understand the Holy Quran.\"“ Furthermore, it specifies in article 3.7.6: “\"Arabic as elective subject shall be offered properly at Secondary and Higher Secondary level with Arabic literature and grammar in its course to enable the learners to have command in the language.\"“ This law is also valid for private schools as it defines in article 3.7.12: “\"The curriculum in Islamiyat, Arabic and Moral Education of public sector will be adopted by the private institutions to make uniformity in the society.\"“\n\nPersian (فارسی) was the official and cultural language of the Mughal Empire, a continuation since the introduction of the language by Central Asian Turkic invaders who migrated into the Indian Subcontinent, and the patronisation of it by the earlier Turko-Persian Delhi Sultanate. Persian was officially abolished with the arrival of the British: in Sindh in 1843 and in Punjab in 1849. It is today spoken primarily by the Dari speaking refugees from Afghanistan and the Hazara community of Quetta.\n\nBengali (بنگالی) is not an official language in Pakistan, but a significant number of Pakistani citizens have migrated from East Bengal and live in West Pakistan or East Pakistan prior to 1971. Bengali was recognised as the second official language of Pakistan on 29 February 1956, and article 214(1) of the constitution of Pakistan was reworded to \"The state language of Pakistan shall be Urdu and Bengali\". Others include illegal immigrants who migrated from Bangladesh after 1971. Most Pakistani Bengalis, are bilingual speaking both Urdu and Bengali, and are mainly settled in Karachi.\n\nTurkic languages were used by the ruling Turco-Mongols such as the Mughals and earlier Sultans of the subcontinent. There are small pockets of Turkic speakers found throughout the country, notably in the valleys in the countries northern regions which lie adjacent to Central Asia, western Pakistani region of Waziristan principally around Kanigoram where the Burki tribe dwells and in Pakistan's urban centres of Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. The autobiography of Mughal emperor Babur, Tuzk Babari was also written in Turkish. After returning from exile in Safavid Persia in 1555, Mughal emperor Humayun further introduced Persian language and culture in the court and government. The Chaghatai language, in which Babur had written his memoirs, disappeared almost entirely from the culture of the courtly elite, and Mughal emperor Akbar could not speak it. Later in life, Humayun himself is said to have spoken in Persian verse more often than not.\n\nA number of Turkic speaking refugees, mostly Uzbeks and Turkmens from Afghanistan and Uyghurs from China have settled in Pakistan.\n\nOther languages spoken by linguistic minorities include the languages listed below, with speakers ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands. A few are highly endangered languages that may soon have no speakers at all.\n\nThe Indo-Iranian languages derive from a reconstructed common proto-language, called Proto-Indo-Iranian.\n\nMost of the languages of Pakistan belong to the Indo-Iranian (more commonly known as Indo-Iranic) branch of the Indo-European language family. They are divided between two or three major groups: Indo-Aryan (the majority, including Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Hindko, and Saraiki, among others), Iranian (or Iranic) (the major ones being Pashto, Balochi, and Khowar, among others) and Dardic (the major one being Kashmiri). At times Dardic is considered another branch of Indo-Iranian, but many linguists term Dardic as individual Indo-Aryan languages that do not form any subgrouping within Indo-Aryan. The Nuristani language, considered another individual branch of Indo-Iranian, is spoken by the Nuristani minority in Afghanistan near the Afghan-Pakistani border, but not known to be spoken indigenously in Pakistan.\n\nSome of the important languages in the Indo-Aryan group are dialect continuums. One of these is Lahnda, and includes Western Punjabi (but not standard Punjabi), Northern Hindko, Southern Hindko, Khetrani, Saraiki, and Pahari-Potwari, plus two more languages outside of Pakistan. The other is Marwari, and includes Marwari of Pakistan and several languages of India (Dhundari, Marwari, Merwari, Mewari, and Shekhawati). A third is Rajasthani, and consists of Bagri, Gujari in Pakistan and several others in India: Gade Lohar, Harauti (Hadothi), Malvi, and Wagdi.\n\nAlthough Urdu is not a dialect continuum, it is a major dialect of Hindustani and somewhat differs from Hindi, another dialect of Hindustani which is not spoken in Pakistan.\n\nThere are several dialects continuums in the Iranian group as well: Balochi, which includes Eastern, Western and Southern Balochi; and Pashto, and includes Northern, Central, and Southern Pashto.\n\nThe following three languages of Pakistan are not part of the Indo-European language family:\n\n\nAll languages of Pakistan, besides English, are written in Nastaʿlīq, a modified Perso-Arabic script. The Mughal Empire adopted Persian as the court language during their rule over South Asia as did their predecessors, such as the Ghaznavids. During this time, came into widespread use in South Asia. The influence remains to this day. In Pakistan, almost everything in Urdu is written in the script, concentrating the greater part of Nastaʿlīq usage in the world.\n\nThe Urdu alphabet is the right-to-left alphabet. It is a modification of the Persian alphabet, which is itself a derivative of the Arabic alphabet. With 38 letters, the Urdu alphabet is typically written in the calligraphic Nasta'liq script, whereas Arabic is more commonly in the Naskh style.\n\nSindhi adopted a variant of the Persian alphabet as well, in the 19th century. The script is used in Pakistan today. It has a total of 52 letters, augmenting the Urdu with digraphs and eighteen new letters () for sounds particular to Sindhi and other Indo-Aryan languages. Some letters that are distinguished in Arabic or Persian are homophones in Sindhi.\n\nBalochi and Pashto are written in Perso-Arabic script. The Shahmukhī script, a variant of the Urdu alphabet, is used to write the Punjabi language in Pakistan.\n\nUsually, bare transliterations of Urdu into Roman letters, Roman Urdu, omit many phonemic elements that have no equivalent in English or other languages commonly written in the Latin script. The National Language Authority of Pakistan has developed a number of systems with specific notations to signify non-English sounds, but these can only be properly read by someone already familiar with Urdu.\n\n\n"}

It is mutually intelligible with Cantonese spoken in both Hong Kong and Guangzhou in Mainland China but has distinct differences in vocabulary and pronunciation which make it unique.\n\nCantonese is widely spoken amongst Malaysian Chinese in the capital Kuala Lumpur and throughout much of the surrounding Klang Valley (Petaling Jaya, Ampang, Cheras, Selayang, Sungai Buloh, Puchong, Shah Alam, Kajang, Bangi and Subang Jaya) excluding Klang itself where Hokkien predominates. It is also widely spoken in the town of Sekinchan in the\nSabak Bernam district of northern Selangor. It is also used in central and southern Perak, especially in the state capital Ipoh and the surrounding towns of the Kinta Valley region (Gopeng, Batu Gajah and Kampar) as well as the towns of Tapah and Bidor in the Batang Padang district of southern Perak. In Pahang, it is spoken in the state capital Kuantan and the districts of Raub, Bentong, Mentakab and Cameron Highlands. Cantonese is also spoken throughout most of Negeri Sembilan, particularly in the state capital Seremban. It is widely spoken in Sandakan, Sabah and Cantonese speakers can also be found in other areas such as Sarikei, Sarawak and Mersing, Johor.\n\nDue to its predominance in the capital city, Cantonese is highly influential in local Chinese-language media and is used in commerce by Malaysian Chinese. As a result, Cantonese is widely understood and spoken with varying fluency by Chinese throughout Malaysia, regardless of their dialect group. This is in spite of Hokkien being the most widely spoken variety and Mandarin being the medium of education at Chinese-language schools. The widespread influence of Cantonese is also due in large part to the popularity of Hong Kong media, particularly TVB dramas.\n\nA sizeable portion of Malaysian Cantonese speakers, including native speakers, are not of Cantonese ancestry, with many belonging to different ancestral dialect groups such as Hakka, Hokkien and Teochew. The historical and continued influence of their original dialects has produced variation and change in the pronuncation of particular sounds in Malaysian Cantonese when compared to \"standard\" Cantonese. Depending on their ancestral origin and educational background, some speakers may not exhibit the unique characteristics described below.\n\n\nMalaysian Cantonese is in contact with many other Chinese dialects such as Hakka, Hokkien and Teochew as well other languages such Malay and English.

In 2014, she was conferred with Rani Laskhmibai Stree Shakti Puraskar by the President of India. Along with Mary Prema Pierick, global head of the Missionaries of Charity, she won the 'Outstanding Women Award' in 2011.\n\nPradhan is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of the 21st century global feminist movement. She is frequently featured among World’s top activists and authors by prestigious international publications and organizations. In 2016, the New York based Bustle (magazine) named her among 20 most inspiring Feminists Authors and Activists along with Nobel Prize winners Shirin Ebadi, Rigoberta Menchú, Malala Yousafzai, Betty Friedan, Naomi Klein, Angela Davis, Kate Millett and Gloria Steinem. In 2017, the Los Angeles based Welker Media Inc. named her among 12 most powerful feminist change makers.\n\nIn 2018, the Oxford Union of University of Oxford invited her to address the union, putting her in the league of eminent global icons like Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Winston Churchill, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Margaret Thatcher, Elton John and a host of world leaders who have addressed the union. \n\nShe is the founder of Nirbhaya Vahini, Nirbhaya Samaroh and OYSS Women. She has served on the panel of Central Board of Film Certification (Censor Board) for India and Inquiry Committee of the National Commission for Women.\n\nBorn to a poor family in a remote village of Odisha, she fought successfully the widely prevalent social taboo against educating women, walked 15 km daily amidst hilly terrain and swamp to the only high school in the entire region to emerge as first woman matriculate of her village and subsequently the first woman law graduate of her region. The inspiring life story of Manasi Pradhan has been adopted as documentaries in United States and Israel.\n\nPradhan was born to a very poor family in a remote village called Ayatapur in Banapur block of Khordha district, Odisha. She was the eldest among two daughters and a son born to Hemalata Pradhan and Godabarish Pradhan. Her father was a farmer and mother a house wife.\n\nFemale education was considered a major taboo in most rural areas of Banapur then. Girls were rarely allowed to attend high school. After completing her middle school in the village, there was strong pressure to end her studies. Further, there was no high school in the nearby areas.\n\nShe walked 15 km daily, amidst hilly terrain and swamp, to the only high school in the entire region, to emerge as the first woman to pass high school examination in her village.\n\nAfter completing her schooling from Patitapaban High School in Gambharimunda, the family shifted to Puri for her college education. With little earning from the village farmland, it became difficult to sustain and the burden of the entire family fell on her shoulder. Soon after passing the intermediate examination, she had to work to support her family and her studies. She earned a B.A. in Economics from Government Women’s College, Puri, and M.A. in Odia literature from Utkal University. She obtained Bachelor of Laws from G.M. Law College, Puri.\n\nShe worked with the finance department, Govt. of Odisha and Andhra Bank for a short period but left both to pursue her own passion. In October 1983, at the age of 21, she began her own printing business and a literary journal. In few years time, the business grew exponentially, putting her in the league of few successful women entrepreneurs of her time.\n\nIn 1987, she founded OYSS Women. The initial motive was to help girl students achieve higher education and develop them as future leaders in the society. OYSS Women has been organizing leadership workshops, education and vocational training camps, legal awareness and self-defense camps, nurturing thousands of young women as prospective leaders in their chosen field.\nApart from the above, the organization undertakes numerous activities and events and is widely credited for pioneering contribution in empowering women. The organization is also spearheading the Honour for Women National Campaign.\n\nIn November 2009, she launched the Honour for Women National Campaign, a nationwide movement to end violence against women in India. The movement has been instrumental in galvanizing the nation against women atrocities.\n\nThe movement employs a multi-pronged strategy to fight the menace of violence against women in India.\n\nIt uses a plethora of vehicles i.e. women’s rights stall, women’s rights festival, women’s rights meets, women’s rights literature, audio-visual displays, street plays etc. to raise awareness on legal and institutional provisions to fight atrocities on women.\n\nOn the other hand, it puts pressure on the state by mobilizing public opinion and sustained campaigning for institutional changes and correctional measures to contain violence against women.\nIn 2013, after a four year long churning involving a series of national seminars, workshops and consultations involving stakeholders from across India, the movement came up with a detailed draft charting its fight to end violence against women.\nIn 2014, the movement released a Four-Point Charter of Demand for all state governments of India. In the same year, it launched Nirbhaya Vahini, consisting of over 10,000 volunteers spread across India to mobilize public opinion and engage in a sustained campaign for implementation of its four-point charter of demand.\n\nIn 2014, the Honour for Women National Campaign headed by Manasi Pradhan released a four-point charter of demand for all state governments of India.

{"id": "1116207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1116207", "title": "Mozart's name", "text": "Mozart's name\n\nThe composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (; ; ) went by many different names in his lifetime. This resulted partly from the church traditions of the day, and partly from the fact that Mozart was multilingual and freely adapted his name to other languages.\n\nMozart was baptized on 28 January 1756, the day after his birth, at St. Rupert's Cathedral in Salzburg as \"Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart\". The baptismal register of the cathedral parish contains the entry shown below, written down in Latin by city chaplain Leopold Lamprecht. A transcriptions with editorial additions by Otto Erich Deutsch follows.\n\nMozart's father Leopold announced the birth of his son in a letter to the publisher Johann Jakob Lotter with the words \"... the boy is called Joannes Chrisostomus, Wolfgang, Gottlieb\" (\"der Bub heißt Joannes Chrisostomus, Wolfgang, Gottlieb\" in German). The baptismal names \"Joannes\" and \"Chrysostomus\" also have German equivalents, namely \"Johann\" and \"Chrysostomos\" (or less frequently, \"Chrysostom\"). The widely used \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" employs these versions in the heading name for its Mozart article, which parenthesizes the little-used baptismal names: \"(Johann Chrysostom) Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\"\n\nHere are the details of the various names given on the register:\n\nAustrian musicologist Otto Erich Deutsch, who studied all available letters and documents about the composer, arrived at the following conclusion about what the composer called himself: \"In Italy, from 1770, Mozart called himself 'Wolfgango Amadeo', and from about 1777, 'Wolfgang Amadè'.\"\n\nThe use of multiple language versions of the same name was perhaps common in Mozart's day. Joseph Haydn went by \"Joseph\" (German, English and French), \"Josephus\" (Latin) and \"Giuseppe\" (Italian); and Ludwig van Beethoven published his works as \"Luigi\" (Italian) and as \"Louis\" (French).\n\nMozart's preference for \"Wolfgang Amadè\" can be seen on the wedding contract for his marriage to Constanze Weber, dated August 3, 1782, where the composer's signature is \"Wolfgang Amade Mozart\". In the parish register entry for the marriage, dated August 4, Mozart is referred to as \"Herr Wolfgang Adam Mozart\".\n\nMozart spelled \"Amadè\" variously in regard to the accent on the final letter. Robert Spaethling, who translated many of the composer's letters, writes, \"[Mozart] is especially nonchalant in his placement of Italian and French accents: sometime he writes 'chèr papa', at other times 'chér papa,' and even his own name appears variously as 'Amadé', 'Amadè', and plain 'Amade'.\" As a web search indicates, modern usage also varies among these three alternatives.\n\nMozart's preference for \"Amadè\" was not in general respected by others. Frequently, he was called either \"Wolfgang Amadeus\" or \"Wolfgang Gottlieb\". Here are examples:\n\nIt is possible that the now-standard \"Amadeus\" originated as a facetious name. He signed some letters in mock Latin as \"Wolfgangus Amadeus Mozartus\"; this was certainly no accident as in one letter he did the same to the date of the letter as well: adding \"-us\" to the end of each word.\n\nMozart's only mention as \"Wolfgang Amadeus\" in an official document made during his lifetime was found in 1998 by Mozart scholar Michael Lorenz in the registers of the Lower Austrian Governorship, where in May 1787 \"Mozart Wolfgang Amadeus\" is referred to as having applied for the return of his written surety for his friend . Other uses of \"Amadeus\", from immediately after Mozart's death in 1791, are given above.\n\nThe 19th century saw the gradual victory of \"Amadeus\" over alternative middle names. The earliest (18th century) biographers of Mozart, such as Friedrich Schlichtegroll and Franz Niemetschek, used \"Gottlieb\". However, in 1798 the publishing firm of Breitkopf & Härtel began to issue a (partial) Complete Works edition under the name \"Amadeus\". The dominance of \"Amadeus\" began around about 1810; Romanticism, notably in the person of E. T. A. Hoffmann, \"seized upon this name to proclaim its veneration for Mozart\". Although various scholars since that time have made use of \"Amadè\" or \"Gottlieb\", \"Amadeus\" remains by far the most familiar term for the general public.\n\nIn the frequently playful letters of his youth Mozart would sometimes spell his name backwards, viz., \"Mozart Wolfgang\" or \"Trazom\". See above for the possible origin of \"Amadeus\" as facetious.\n\n"}

{"id": "879002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=879002", "title": "Philippine English", "text": "Philippine English\n\nPhilippine English is any variety of English (similar and related to English) native to the Philippines, including those used by the media and the vast majority of educated Filipinos. English is taught in schools as one of the two official languages of the country, the other being Filipino (Tagalog). Code-switching is prevalent in informal situations.\n\nPhilippine laws and court decisions, with extremely rare exceptions, are written solely in English. English is also used in higher education, religious affairs, print and broadcast media, and business. Most educated Filipinos are bilinguals and speak English as one of their languages. For highly technical subjects such as nursing, medicine, computing and calculus, English is the preferred medium for textbooks, communication, etc. Very few would prefer highly technical books in the vernacular. Movies and TV shows in English are usually not dubbed in most cable channels except a few such as Tagalized Movie Channel.\n\nBecause English is part of the curricula from primary to secondary education, many Filipinos write and speak in fluent Philippine English, although there might be differences in diction and pronunciation. Most schools in the Philippines, however, are staffed by teachers who are speakers of Philippine English and hence notable differences from the American English from which it was derived are observable.\n\nPhilippine English traditionally follows American English spelling and grammar, except when it comes to punctuation as well as date notations. For example, a comma almost never precedes the final item in an enumeration (much like the \"AP Stylebook\" and other style guides used in the English-speaking world). Except for some very fluent speakers (like news anchors), even in English-language media, dates are also often read with a cardinal instead of an ordinal number (e.g. \"January one\" instead of \"January first\") even if the written form is the same. This is mostly because educated Filipinos were taught to count English numbers cardinally, thus it carried over to their style of reading dates. In military-style (or sometimes officialese) date notation (e.g. 1 January) the American standard is mostly followed, that is \"one January\".\n\nTautologies like redundancy and pleonasm are common despite the emphasis on brevity and simplicity in making sentences; they are common to many speakers, especially among the older generations. The possible explanation is that the English language teachers who came to the Philippines were taught old-fashioned grammar, thus they spread that style to the students they served. Examples are \"At this point in time\" and \".. will be the one ...\" (or \"... will be the one who will ...\") instead of \"now\" and \"... will ...\" respectively - e.g., \"I will be the one who will go ...\", rather than \"I will go ...\".\n\nPhilippine English is a rhotic accent due to heavy American English influence, contrary to most Commonwealth English variants spoken in neighboring countries such as Malaysia or Singapore. The only exception to this rule is the word \"Marlboro\", which is frequently read as \"Malboro\". Therefore, phonemes are pronounced in all positions. Native and well-educated speakers may also feature flapping and vowel sounds resembling the California vowel shift due to the influence of Hollywood movies and call center culture.\n\nFor non-native speakers, Philippine English phonological features are heavily dependent on the speaker's mother tongue, although foreign languages such as Spanish also influenced many Filipinos on the way of pronouncing English words. This is why approximations are very common and so are hypercorrections. The most distinguishable feature is the lack of fricative consonants, particularly , and . Another feature is the general absence of the schwa , and therefore pronounced by its respective full equivalent vowel although the r-colored variant is increasingly popular in recent years.\n\nThe following consonant changes apply for most non-native speakers of the language:\n\nVowels in Philippine English are pronounced according to the letter they symbolize, so that are generally pronounced as , respectively. The schwa , which has various interpretations in English, is somewhat rare in Philippine languages and usually exists in minority languages such as Kinaray-a or the \"Abagatan\" (Southern) dialect of Ilocano. \n\n\nMonolingual Filipino-language-speakers often have non-standard pronunciations; a number of other indigenous languages, employ phonemes such as , , and . This form of mispronunciation, caused by the limited sound inventories of most Philippine languages compared to English (which has more than 40 phonemes), is generally frowned upon by Anglophone Filipinos, in particular, and businesses dealing with international clients.\n\nSome examples of non-native pronunciation include:\n\n\nPhilippine English has evolved tremendously from where it began decades ago. Some decades before English was officially introduced, if not arguably forced, to the Philippines, the nation had been subject to Spanish rule and thus Spanish was the language of power and influence. However, in 1898, when the Spanish gave the United States control of the nation, the English language, although initially disfavored, became widely used in a matter of years. This was catalyzed by the coming of American teachers called ‘Thomasites’ (Bolton & Bautista, 2004). Before gaining independence, language policy makers had already started discussing formation of a common language for the Philippines that today is known as Filipino. Filipino became the national language, and English was given the status of an official language of the Philippines; English is the dominant superstrate language, as it is perceived by many as a symbol of status and power, replacing Spanish as the dominant superstate language. With the English language highly embedded in Philippine society, it was only a matter of time before the language was indigenized to the point that it became differentiated from English varieties found in the United States, United Kingdom, or elsewhere. This, along with the formal introduction of the World Englishes (WE) framework to English language scholars in the Philippines by renowned linguist Braj B. Kachru, which occurred at a conference in Manila, opened the floodgates to research on this new emerging English, which has since been branded as Philippine English.\n\nThe abundant supply of English speakers and competitive labor costs have enabled the Philippines to become a choice destination for foreign companies wishing to establish call centers and other outsourcing. English proficiency sustains a major call center industry and in 2005, America Online has 1,000 people in what used to be the US Air Force's Clark Air Base in Angeles City answering ninety percent of their global e-mail inquiries. Citibank does its global ATM programming in the country, and Procter & Gamble has over 400 employees in Makati, a central Manila neighborhood, doing back office work for their Asian operations including finance, accounting, Human Resources and payments processing.\n\nAn influx of foreign students, principally from South Korea, has also led to growth in the number of English language learning centers, especially in Metro Manila, Baguio City, Metro Cebu and Metro Bacolod.\n\nRecently, the Spanish Ministry for External Affairs and the Japanese government decided to hire speakers of the Philippine English as Language Assistants for their own respective nations.\n\n\n\n"}

This is usually used to hold up a roof, creating a largely open space beneath, for whatever use the building is designed for. The horizontal elements are called by a variety of names including lintel, header, architrave or beam, and the supporting vertical elements may be called columns, pillars, or posts. The use of wider elements at the top of the post, called capitals, to help spread the load, is common to many traditions. \n\nThe trabeated system is a fundamental principle of Neolithic architecture, ancient Indian architecture, ancient Greek architecture and ancient Egyptian architecture. Other trabeated styles are the Persian, Lycian, Japanese, traditional Chinese, and ancient Chinese architecture, especially in northern China, and nearly all the Indian styles. The traditions are represented in North and Central America by Mayan architecture, and in South America by Inca architecture. In all or most of these traditions, certainly in Greece and India, the earliest versions developed using wood, which were later translated into stone for larger and grander buildings. Timber framing, also using trusses, remains common for smaller buildings such as houses to the modern day.\n\nThe biggest disadvantage to a post and lintel construction is the limited weight that can be held up, and the small distances required between the posts. Ancient Roman architecture's development of the arch allowed for much larger structures to be constructed. The arcuated system spreads larger loads more effectively, and replaced the post and lintel trabeated system in most larger buildings and structures, until the introduction of steel girder beams in the industrial era. As with the Roman temple portico front and its descendents in later classical architecture, trabeated features were often retained in parts of buildings as an aesthetic choice. The classical orders of Greek origin were in particular retained in buildings designed to impress, even though they usually had little or no structural role.\n\nIn architecture, a post-and-lintel or trabeated system refers to the use of horizontal beams or lintels which are borne up by columns or posts. The name is from the Latin \"trabs\", \"beam\"; influenced by \"trabeatus\", clothed in the \"trabea\", a ritual garment.\n\nA noteworthy example of a trabeated system is in Volubilis, from the Roman era, where one side of the Decumanus Maximus is lined with trabeated elements, while the opposite side of the roadway is designed in arched style.\n\nIn India the style was used originally for wooden construction, but later the technique was adopted for stone structures for decorated load-bearing and purely ornamented non-structural purposes.\n\nPost and lintel construction is one of four ancient structural methods of building, the others being the corbel, arch-and-vault, and truss.\n\nThere are two main force vectors acting upon the post and lintel system: weight carrying compression at the joint between lintel and post, and tension induced by deformation of self-weight and the load above between the posts. The two posts are under compression from the weight of the lintel (or beam) above. The lintel will deform by sagging in the middle because the underside is under tension and the topside is under compression.\n\n\n"}

He was associated with the Progressive artist's group along with greats like M.F. Hussain, Tyeb Mehta, S.H. Raza. He is said to be one of the first Indian artists to give up figurativism for abstract art. His art commands high prices in the domestic and international market. His work \"The Vagabond\" fetched $1.1 million at Christie's, setting another world record for the artist.\nHe is also one of the few Indian Modernist masters accomplished in writing as well as painting.\n\nRam Kumar Verma was born in Shimla, the capital of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh in a large middle-class family of eight brothers and sisters. His father was a government employee from Patiala in Punjab, India who worked in the Civil and Administrative Division in the British Government.\nWhile pursuing M.A. in Economics from St. Stephen's College, Delhi, he chanced upon an art exhibition in 1945. One evening, after \"loitering\" around Connaught Place with his friends from St Stephen's College, he landed up at an art exhibition.\n\nRam Kumar took classes at the Sharda Ukil School of Art under Sailoz Mukherjee and gave up employment at a bank in 1948 to pursue art. Sailoz Mukherjee was a painter from Shantiniketan School who introduced him to still life painting with live models. While a student there, he met Raza at an exhibition. Raza and Ram became good friends. He convinced his father to pay for a one-way ticket to Paris and studied further there under Andre Lhote and Fernand Léger. In Paris, the pacificist peace movement attracted him and he joined the French Communist Party. Seeking inspiration in the Social Realists such as Kathe and Fourgenon. He was befriended by S.H. Raza and MF Hussain who are two major artists.\n\nRam Kumar painted abstract landscapes, usually in oil or acrylic. He was also associated with the Progressive artist's group.\n\nRam Kumar has participated in various exhibitions in and out of India, including the 1958 Venice Biennale and the Festival of India shows in the then USSR and Japan in 1987 and 1988. One of Ram Kumar's latest solo exhibition was in 2008 in Delhi. Ram Kumar also writes in Hindi and eight collections of his works have been published, as well as two novels and a travelogue.\n\nThe human condition is the main concern of the painter manifested in his early works by the alienated individual within the city. Later the city, specifically Varanasi with its dilapidated, crammed houses, conveys a sense of hopelessness. Increasingly abstract works done in sweeping strokes of paint evoke both exultation of natural spaces and more recently an incipient violence within human habitation.\n\nAs the interest in Indian art has grown, paintings by Ram Kumar are getting increasing recognition in the art market.\n\nRam Kumar received the Padma Shri in 1972 and the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, in 2010.\n\nRam Kumar was also the older brother of the famous Hindi writer, Nirmal Verma and younger brother of Colonel, Raj Kumar Verma. He lived and worked in Delhi until his death in 2018.\n\n\n"}

It is the official language of the Pakistani province of Sindh. In India, Sindhi is one of the scheduled languages officially recognized by the central government, though Sindhi is not an official language of any of the states in India.\n\nMost Sindhi speakers are concentrated in Pakistan in the Sindh province, and in India, the Kutch region of the state of Gujarat and in the Ulhasnagar region of the state of Maharashtra. The remaining speakers in India are composed of the Sindhi Hindus who migrated from Sindh, which became a part of Pakistan and settled in India after the independence of Pakistan in 1947 and the Sindhi diaspora worldwide. Sindhi language is spoken in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab provinces of Pakistan as well as the states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Gujarat in India as well as immigrant communities in Spain, Hong Kong, Oman, Indonesia, Singapore, UAE, Russia, UK, Caribbean Islands and the US.\n\nIndian Government has legislated Sindhi as a language of option and as medium of study in India, so that students can choose to learn Sindhi. Sindhi is an optional third language in the Indian states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nRajasthan Sindhi Academy has been set up for the promotion of Sindhi Language in Rajasthan.\n\nThe language is included as one of the official languages into Indian Constitution by Government of India in the 21st Amendment in 1967.\n\nThe Sindhi language and other native languages of Pakistan are struggling to be officially given the status of national language in Pakistan. Before the inception of Pakistan, Sindhi was the national language of Sindh.\n\nThere are many Sindhi language television channels broadcasting in Pakistan such as KTN, Sindh TV, Awaz Television Network, Mehran TV and Dharti TV. Besides this, the Indian television network Doordarshan has been asked by the Indian High Court to start a news channel for Sindhi speakers in India.\n\nThe name \"Sindhi\" is derived from \"Sindhu\", the local name of the Indus River.\n\nLike other languages of this family, Sindhi has passed through Old Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) and Middle Indo-Aryan (Pali, secondary Prakrits, and Apabhramsha) stages of growth, and it entered the New Indo-Aryan stage around the 10th century CE.\n\nIn the year 1868, the Bombay Presidency assigned \"Narayan Jagannath Vaidya\" to replace the Abjad used in Sindhi, with the \"Khudabadi script\". The script was decreed a standard script by the Bombay Presidency thus inciting anarchy in the Muslim majority region. A powerful unrest followed, after which Twelve Martial Laws were imposed by the British authorities.\n\nAccording to Islamic Sindhi tradition, the first translation of the Quran into Sindhi was completed in the year 883 CE / 270 AH in Mansura, Sindh. The first extensive Sindhi translation was done by Akhund Azaz Allah Muttalawi (1747–1824 CE / 1160–1240 AH) and first published in Gujarat in 1870. The first to appear in print was by Muhammad Siddiq (Lahore 1867).\n\nWhen Sindh was occupied by British army and was annexed with Bombay, governor of the province Sir George Clerk ordered to make Sindhi the official language in the province in 1848. Sir Bartle Frere, the then commissioner of Sindh, issued orders on August 29, 1857 advising civil servants in Sindh to qualify examination in Sindhi. He also ordered Sindhi to be used in all official communication. Seven-grade education system commonly known as Sindhi-Final was introduced in Sindh. Sindhi Final was made a prerequisite for employment in revenue, police and education departments.\n\nSindhi has a relatively large inventory of both consonants and vowels compared to other languages. Sindhi has 46 consonant phonemes and 16 vowels. The consonant to vowel ratio is around average for world's languages at 2.8. All plosives, affricates, nasals, the retroflex flap and the lateral approximant /l/ have aspirated or breathy voiced counterparts. The language also features four implosives.\n\nThe retroflex consonants are apical postalveolar and do not involve curling back of the tip of the tongue, so they could be transcribed in phonetic transcription. The dental implosive is sometimes realized as retroflex ~ The affricates are laminal post-alveolars with a relatively short release. It is not clear if is similar, or truly palatal. is realized as labiovelar or labiodental in free variation, but is not common, except before a stop.\n\nThe vowels are modal length and short . (Note are imprecisely transcribed as in the chart.) Consonants following short vowels are lengthened: 'leaf' vs. 'worn'.\n\nSindhi has borrowed from English and Hindustani. Today, Sindhi in Pakistan is slightly influenced by Urdu, with more borrowed Perso-Arabic elements, while Sindhi in India is influenced by Hindi, with more borrowed tatsam Sanskrit elements.\n\n\"The following extract is from the about the Sindhi language and is written in the 52-letter Sindhi-Arabic script, Devanagari and transliterated to Latin.\"\n\nSindhi-Arabic script: \n\nDevanagari script: \n\nTransliteration (IAST): \n\nThe dialects of Sindhi include Vicholi, Lari, Lasi, Kathiawari Katchi, Thareli, Macharia, Dukslinu and Muslim Sindhi. The \"Siraiki\" dialect in northern Sindh is distinct from the Saraiki language of South Punjab and has variously been treated either as a dialect of it, or as a dialect of Sindhi. The Sindhi dialects previously known as \"Siraiki\" are nowadays more commonly referred to as \"Siroli\".\n\nWritten Sindhi is mentioned in the 8th century, when references to a Sindhi version of the Mahabharata appear. However, the earliest attested records in Sindhi are from the 15th century.\n\nBefore the standardisation of Sindhi orthography, numerous forms of the Devanagari and Lunda (Laṇḍā) scripts were used for trading. For literary and religious purposes, an Arabic-Persian alphabet known as \"Ab-ul-Hassan Sindhi\" and Gurmukhi (a subset of Laṇḍā) were used. Another two scripts, \"Khudabadi\" and \"Shikarpuri\", were reforms of the Landa script. During British rule in the late 19th century, a Persian alphabet was decreed standard over Devanagari.\n\nMedieval Sindhi devotional literature (1500–1843) comprises Sufi poetry and Advaita Vedanta poetry. Sindhi literature flourished during the modern period (since 1843), although the language and literary style of contemporary Sindhi writings in Pakistan and India were noticeably diverging by the late 20th century; authors from the former country were borrowing extensively from Persian and Arabic vocabulary, while those from the latter were highly influenced by Hindi.\n\nLaṇḍā-based scripts, such as Gurmukhi, Khojki and the Khudabadi script were used historically to write Sindhi.\n\nThe Khudabadi alphabet was invented in 1550 CE, and was used alongside other scripts by the Hindu community until the colonial era, where the sole usage of the Arabic script for official purposes was legislated.\n\nThe script continued to be used in a smaller scale by the trader community until the independence of Pakistan in 1947.\n\nKhojki was employed primarily to record Muslim Shia Ismaili religious literature, as well as literature for a few secret Shia Muslim sects.\n\nThe Gurmukhi script was also used to write Sindhi, mainly in the North of Sindh, and also by Hindu women.\n\nDuring British rule in India, a variant of the Persian alphabet was adopted for Sindhi in the 19th century. The script is used in Pakistan today. It has a total of 64 letters, augmenting the Persian with digraphs and eighteen new letters () for sounds particular to Sindhi and other Indo-Aryan languages. Some letters that are distinguished in Arabic or Persian are homophones in Sindhi.\n\nIn India, the Devanagari script is also used to write Sindhi. A modern version was introduced by the government of India in 1948; however, it did not gain full acceptance, so both the Sindhi-Arabic and Devanagari scripts are used. In India a person may write a Sindhi language paper for a Civil Services Examination in either script\n. Diacritical bars below the letter are used to mark implosive consonants, and dots called \"nukta\" are used to form other additional consonants.\n\nThe Gujarati script is used to write the Kutchi dialect in India.\n\nThe Sindhi-Roman script or Roman-Sindhi script is the contemporary Sindhi script usually used by the Sindhis during texting messages on their mobile phones. A Sindhi writer Haleem Brohi was the staunch advocate of the Roman-Sindhi script and he also wrote book for that script.\n\nSindhi language software such as Sindhi language keyboards have been developed for the Windows OS, Android smartphones. Various other online websites provide Sindhi keyboard such as (Keymanweb.org), M.B Sindhi keyboard by Majid Bhurgri. Software has also been developed for the transliteration between the main writing systems.\n\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\n"}

Historically, it has also been known in English as \"Cambrian\", \"Cambric\" and \"Cymric\".\n\nOf usual residents in Wales aged three and over, 19.0% were able to speak Welsh according to the United Kingdom Census 2011. According to the 2001 Census, 20.8 per cent of the population aged 3+ were able to speak Welsh. This suggests that there was a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers in Wales from 2001 to 2011 – from about 582,000 to 562,000 respectively. However, according to the Welsh Language Use Survey 2013–15, 24 per cent of people aged three and over living in Wales were able to speak Welsh, implying a possible increase in the prevalence of the Welsh language since the 2011 census.\n\nThe Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 gave the Welsh language official status in Wales, making it the only language that is \"de jure\" official in any part of the United Kingdom, with English being \"de facto\" official. The Welsh language, along with English, is also a \"de jure\" official language of the National Assembly for Wales.\n\nThe language of the Welsh developed from the language of Britons, according to academic T. M. Charles-Edwards. The emergence of Welsh was not instantaneous and clearly identifiable. Instead, the shift occurred over a long period of time, with some historians claiming that it had happened by as late as the 9th century, with a watershed moment being that proposed by Kenneth H. Jackson, the Battle of Dyrham, a military battle between the West Saxons and the Britons in 577 AD., which split the South Western British from direct overland contact with the Welsh.\n\nFour periods are identified in the history of Welsh, with rather indistinct boundaries: Primitive Welsh, Old Welsh, Middle Welsh, and Modern Welsh. The period immediately following the language's emergence is sometimes referred to as Primitive Welsh, followed by the Old Welsh period – which is generally considered to stretch from the beginning of the 9th century to sometime during the 12th century. The Middle Welsh period is considered to have lasted from then until the 14th century, when the Modern Welsh period began, which in turn is divided into Early and Late Modern Welsh.\n\nThe name \"Welsh\" originated as an exonym given to its speakers by the Anglo-Saxons, meaning \"foreign speech\" (see Walha). The native term for the language is : North/Central Wales pronunciation /kɘm'raɪg/, South Wales pronunciation /kɘm'ra:g/.\n\nWelsh evolved from Common Brittonic, the Celtic language spoken by the ancient Celtic Britons. Classified as Insular Celtic, the British language probably arrived in Britain during the Bronze Age or Iron Age and was probably spoken throughout the island south of the Firth of Forth. During the Early Middle Ages the British language began to fragment due to increased dialect differentiation, thus evolving into Welsh and the other Brittonic languages. It is not clear when Welsh became distinct.\n\nKenneth H. Jackson suggested that the evolution in syllabic structure and sound pattern was complete by around 550, and labelled the period between then and about 800 \"Primitive Welsh\". This Primitive Welsh may have been spoken in both Wales and the Hen Ogledd (\"Old North\") – the Brittonic-speaking areas of what is now northern England and southern Scotland – and therefore may have been the ancestor of Cumbric as well as Welsh. Jackson, however, believed that the two varieties were already distinct by that time. The earliest Welsh poetry – that attributed to the or \"Early Poets\" – is generally considered to date to the Primitive Welsh period. However, much of this poetry was supposedly composed in the Hen Ogledd, raising further questions about the dating of the material and language in which it was originally composed. This discretion stems from the fact that Cumbric was widely believed to have been the language used in Hen Ogledd. An 8th-century inscription in Tywyn shows the language already dropping inflections in the declension of nouns.\n\nJanet Davies proposed that the origins of Welsh language were much less definite; in \"The Welsh Language: A History\", she proposes that Welsh may have been around even earlier than 600 AD. This is evidenced by the dropping of final syllables from Brittonic: \"*bardos\" \"poet\" became \"bardd\", and \"*abona\" \"river\" became \"afon\". Though both Davies and Jackson cite minor changes in syllable structure and sounds as evidence for the creation of Old Welsh, Davies suggests it may be more appropriate to refer to this derivative language as rather than characterising it as a new language altogether.\n\nThe argued dates for the period of \"Primitive Welsh\" are widely debated, with some historians' suggestions differing by hundreds of years.\n\nThe next main period is Old Welsh (, 9th to 11th centuries); poetry from both Wales and Scotland has been preserved in this form of the language. As Germanic and Gaelic colonisation of Britain proceeded, the Brittonic speakers in Wales were split off from those in northern England, speaking Cumbric, and those in the southwest, speaking what would become Cornish, and so the languages diverged. Both the works of Aneirin (, c. 600) and the \"Book of Taliesin\" () were during this era.\n\nMiddle Welsh () is the label attached to the Welsh of the 12th to 14th centuries, of which much more remains than for any earlier period. This is the language of nearly all surviving early manuscripts of the \"Mabinogion\", although the tales themselves are certainly much older. It is also the language of the existing Welsh law manuscripts. Middle Welsh is reasonably intelligible to a modern-day Welsh speaker.\n\nThe famous cleric Gerald of Wales tells, in his \"Descriptio Cambriae\", a story of King Henry II of England. During one of the King's many raids in the 12th century, Henry asked an old man of Pencader, Carmarthenshire whether the Welsh people could resist his army. The old man replied:\n\nModern Welsh is subdivided into Early Modern Welsh and Late Modern Welsh. Early Modern Welsh ran from the 15th century through to the end of the 16th century, and the Late Modern Welsh period roughly dates from the 16th century onwards. Contemporary Welsh differs greatly from the Welsh of the 16th century, but they are similar enough for a fluent Welsh speaker to have little trouble understanding it. During the Modern Welsh period there has been a decline in the popularity of the Welsh language: the number of Welsh speakers declined to the point at which there was concern that the language would become extinct. Welsh government processes and legislation have worked to increase the proliferation of the Welsh language, e.g. through education.\n\nThe Bible translations into Welsh helped maintain the use of Welsh in daily life. The New Testament was translated by William Salesbury in 1567, and the complete Bible by William Morgan in 1588.\n\nWelsh has been spoken continuously in Wales throughout recorded history, but by 1911 it had become a minority language, spoken by 43.5 per cent of the population. While this decline continued over the following decades, the language did not die out. By the start of the 21st century, numbers began to increase once more, at least partly as a result of the increase in Welsh medium education.\n\nThe 2004 Welsh Language Use Survey showed that 21.7 per cent of the population of Wales spoke Welsh, compared with 20.8 per cent in the 2001 Census, and 18.5 per cent in 1991 Census. The 2011 Census, however, showed a slight decline to 562,000, or 19 per cent of the population.\nThe census also showed a \"big drop\" in the number of speakers in the Welsh-speaking heartlands, with the number dropping to under 50 per cent in Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire for the first time. However, according to the Welsh Language Use Survey in 2013–15, 24 per cent of people aged three and over were able to speak Welsh. In 2018 a survey by the ONS suggested 29.3 per cent of the population of Wales were able to speak the language.\n\nHistorically, large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh. Over the course of the 20th century this monolingual population \"all but disappeared\", but a small percentage remained at the time of the 1981 census. Most Welsh-speaking people in Wales also speak English (while in Chubut Province, Argentina, most speakers can speak Spanish – see Y Wladfa). However, many Welsh-speaking people are more comfortable expressing themselves in Welsh than in English. A speaker's choice of language can vary according to the subject domain and the social context, even within a single discourse (known in linguistics as code-switching).\n\nWelsh speakers are largely concentrated in the north and west of Wales, principally Gwynedd, Conwy, Denbighshire (\"Sir Ddinbych\"), Anglesey (\"Ynys Môn\"), Carmarthenshire (\"Sir Gâr\"), north Pembrokeshire (\"Sir Benfro\"), Ceredigion, parts of Glamorgan (\"Morgannwg\"), and north-west and extreme south-west Powys. However, first-language and other fluent speakers can be found throughout Wales.\n\nWelsh-speaking communities persisted well into the modern period across the border in England. Archenfield was still Welsh enough in the time of Elizabeth I for the Bishop of Hereford to be made responsible, together with the four Welsh bishops, for the translation of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer into Welsh. Welsh was still commonly spoken here in the first half of the 19th century, and churchwardens' notices were put up in both Welsh and English until about 1860. In one of the earliest works of phonetics, \"On Early English Pronunciation\" in 1889, Alexander John Ellis identified a small part of Shropshire as still speaking Welsh, and plotted a Celtic border that passed from Llanymynech to Chirk through Oswestry.\n\nThe number of Welsh-speaking people in the rest of Britain has not yet been counted for statistical purposes. In 1993, the Welsh-language television channel S4C published the results of a survey into the numbers of people who spoke or understood Welsh, which estimated that there were around 133,000 Welsh-speaking people living in England, about 50,000 of them in the Greater London area. The Welsh Language Board, on the basis of an analysis of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Longitudinal Study, estimated there were 110,000 Welsh-speaking people in England, and another thousand in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In the 2011 Census, 8,248 people in England gave Welsh in answer to the question \"What is your main language?\" The ONS subsequently published a census glossary of terms to support the release of results from the census, including their definition of \"main language\" as referring to \"first or preferred language\" (though that wording was not in the census questionnaire itself). The wards in England with the most people giving Welsh as their main language were the Liverpool wards of Central and Greenbank, and Oswestry South. In terms of the regions of England, North West England (1,945), London (1,310) and the West Midlands (1,265) had the highest number of people noting Welsh as their main language.\n\nThe American Community Survey 2009–2013 noted that 2,235 people aged 5 years and over in the United States spoke Welsh at home. The highest number of those (255) lived in Florida.\n\nAlthough Welsh is a minority language, support for it grew during the second half of the 20th century, along with the rise of organisations such as the nationalist political party from 1925 and Welsh Language Society from 1962.\n\nThe Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998 provide that the Welsh and English languages be treated equally in the public sector, as far as is reasonable and practicable. Each public body is required to prepare for approval a Welsh Language Scheme, which indicates its commitment to the equality of treatment principle. This is sent out in draft form for public consultation for a three-month period, whereupon comments on it may be incorporated into a final version. It requires the final approval of the now defunct Welsh Language Board (). Thereafter, the public body is charged with implementing and fulfilling its obligations under the Welsh Language Scheme. The list of other public bodies which have to prepare Schemes could be added to by initially the Secretary of State for Wales, from 1993–1997, by way of statutory instrument. Subsequent to the forming of the National Assembly for Wales in 1997, the Government Minister responsible for the Welsh language can and has passed statutory instruments naming public bodies who have to prepare Schemes. Neither the 1993 Act nor secondary legislation made under it covers the private sector, although some organisations, notably banks and some railway companies, provide some of their information in Welsh.\n\nOn 7 December 2010, the Welsh Assembly unanimously approved a set of measures to develop the use of the Welsh language within Wales. On 9 February 2011 this measure, the Proposed Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011, was passed and received Royal Assent, thus making the Welsh language an officially recognised language within Wales. The Measure:\n\nWith the passing of this measure, public bodies and some private companies are required to provide services in Welsh. The Welsh government's Minister for Heritage at the time, Alun Ffred Jones, said, \"The Welsh language is a source of great pride for the people of Wales, whether they speak it or not, and I am delighted that this Measure has now become law. I am very proud to have steered legislation through the Assembly which confirms the official status of the Welsh language; which creates a strong advocate for Welsh speakers and will improve the quality and quantity of services available through the medium of Welsh. I believe that everyone who wants to access services in the Welsh language should be able to do so, and that is what this government has worked towards. This legislation is an important and historic step forward for the language, its speakers and for the nation.\" The measure was not welcomed warmly by all supporters: Bethan Williams, chairperson of the Welsh Language Society, gave a mixed response to the move, saying, \"Through this measure we have won official status for the language and that has been warmly welcomed. But there was a core principle missing in the law passed by the Assembly before Christmas. It doesn't give language rights to the people of Wales in every aspect of their lives. Despite that, an amendment to that effect was supported by 18 Assembly Members from three different parties, and that was a significant step forward.\"\n\nOn 5 October 2011, Meri Huws, Chair of the Welsh Language Board, was appointed the new Welsh Language Commissioner. She released a statement that she was \"delighted\" to have been appointed to the \"hugely important role\", adding, \"I look forward to working with the Welsh Government and organisations in Wales in developing the new system of standards. I will look to build on the good work that has been done by the Welsh Language Board and others to strengthen the Welsh language and ensure that it continues to thrive.\" First Minister Carwyn Jones said that Meri would act as a champion for the Welsh language, though some had concerns over her appointment: Plaid Cymru spokeswoman Bethan Jenkins said, \"I have concerns about the transition from Meri Huws's role from the Welsh Language Board to the language commissioner, and I will be asking the Welsh government how this will be successfully managed. We must be sure that there is no conflict of interest, and that the Welsh Language Commissioner can demonstrate how she will offer the required fresh approach to this new role.\" Ms Huws started her role as the Welsh Language Commissioner on 1 April 2012.\n\nLocal councils and the National Assembly for Wales use Welsh, issuing Welsh versions of their literature, to varying degrees.\n\nMost road signs in Wales are in English and Welsh.\n\nSince 2000, the teaching of Welsh has been compulsory in all schools in Wales up to age 16. That has had an effect in stabilising and reversing the decline in the language. It means, for example, that even the children of non-Welsh-speaking parents from elsewhere in the UK grow up with a knowledge of, or complete fluency in, the language.\n\nThe wording on currency is only in English, except in the legend on Welsh pound coins dated 1985, 1990 and 1995, which circulate in all parts of the UK. The wording is , (), and derives from the national anthem of Wales, .\n\nSome shops employ bilingual signage. Welsh rarely appears on product packaging or instructions.\n\nThe UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of Welsh.\nThe language has greatly increased its prominence since the creation of the television channel S4C in November 1982, which until digital switchover in 2010 broadcast 70 per cent of Channel 4's programming along with a majority of Welsh language shows during peak viewing hours. The all-Welsh-language digital station S4C Digidol is available throughout Europe on satellite and online throughout the UK. Since the digital switchover was completed in South Wales on 31 March 2010, S4C Digidol became the main broadcasting channel and fully in Welsh. The main evening television news provided by the BBC in Welsh is available for download. There is also a Welsh-language radio station, BBC Radio Cymru, which was launched in 1977.\n\nThe only Welsh-language national newspaper \"Y Cymro\" (\"The Welshman\") was published weekly until 2017. There is no daily newspaper in Welsh. A daily newspaper called \"Y Byd\" (\"The World\") was scheduled to be launched on 3 March 2008, but was scrapped, owing to poor sales of subscriptions and the Welsh Government deeming the publication not to meet the criteria necessary for the kind of public funding it needed to be rescued. There is a Welsh-language online news service which publishes news stories in Welsh called Golwg360 (\"360 [degree] view\").\n\nThe decade around 1840 was a period of great social upheaval in Wales, manifested in the Chartist movement. In 1839, 20,000 people marched on Newport, resulting in a riot when 20 people were killed by soldiers defending the Westgate Hotel, and the Rebecca Riots where tollbooths on turnpikes were systematically destroyed.\n\nThis unrest brought the state of education in Wales to the attention of the English establishment since social reformers of the time considered education as a means of dealing with social ills. \"The Times\" newspaper was prominent among those who considered that the lack of education of the Welsh people was the root cause of most of the problems.\n\nIn July 1846, three commissioners, R.R.W. Lingen, Jellynger C. Symons and H.R. Vaughan Johnson, were appointed to inquire into the state of education in Wales; the Commissioners were all Anglicans and thus presumed unsympathetic to the nonconformist majority in Wales. The Commissioners presented their report to the Government on 1 July 1847 in three large blue-bound volumes. This report quickly became known as the Treachery of the Blue Books () since, apart from documenting the state of education in Wales, the Commissioners were also free with their comments disparaging the language, nonconformity, and the morals of the Welsh people in general. An immediate effect of the report was that ordinary Welsh people began to believe that the only way to get on in the world was through the medium of English, and an inferiority complex developed about the Welsh language whose effects have not yet been completely eradicated. The historian Professor Kenneth O. Morgan referred to the significance of the report and its consequences as \"the Glencoe and the Amritsar of Welsh history\".\n\nIn the later 19th century, virtually all teaching in the schools of Wales was in English, even in areas where the pupils barely understood English. Some schools used the Welsh Not, a piece of wood, often bearing the letters \"WN\", which was hung around the neck of any pupil caught speaking Welsh. The pupil could pass it on to any schoolmate heard speaking Welsh, with the pupil wearing it at the end of the day being given a beating. One of the most famous Welsh-born pioneers of higher education in Wales was Sir Hugh Owen. He made great progress in the cause of education, and more especially the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth, of which he was chief founder. He has been credited with the Welsh Intermediate Education Act 1889 (52 & 53 Vict c 40), following which several new Welsh schools were built. The first was completed in 1894 and named Ysgol Syr Hugh Owen.\n\nTowards the beginning of the 20th century this policy slowly began to change, partly owing to the efforts of O.M. Edwards when he became chief inspector of schools for Wales in 1907.\n\nThe Aberystwyth Welsh School () was founded in 1939 by Sir Ifan ap Owen Edwards, the son of O.M. Edwards, as the first Welsh Primary School. The headteacher was Norah Isaac. is still a very successful school, and now there are Welsh-language primary schools all over the country. was established in Rhyl in 1956 as the first Welsh-medium secondary school.\nWelsh is now widely used in education, with 101,345 children and young people in Wales receiving their education in Welsh medium schools in 2014/15, 65,460 in primary and 35,885 in secondary. 26 per cent of all schools in Wales are defined as Welsh medium schools, with a further 7.3 per cent offering some Welsh-medium instruction to pupils. 22 per cent of pupils are in schools in which Welsh the primary language of instruction. Under the National Curriculum, it is compulsory that all students study Welsh up to the age of 16 as either a first or a second language. Some students choose to continue with their studies through the medium of Welsh for the completion of their A-levels as well as during their college years. All local education authorities in Wales have schools providing bilingual or Welsh-medium education. The remainder study Welsh as a second language in English-medium schools. Specialist teachers of Welsh called support the teaching of Welsh in the National Curriculum. Welsh is also taught in adult education classes. The Welsh Government has recently set up six centres of excellence in the teaching of Welsh for Adults, with centres in North Wales, Mid Wales, South West, Glamorgan, Gwent. and Cardiff.\n\nThe ability to speak Welsh or to have Welsh as a qualification is desirable for certain career choices in Wales, such as teaching or customer service. All universities in Wales teach courses in the language, with many undergraduate and post-graduate degree programs offered in the medium of Welsh, ranging from law, modern languages, social sciences, and also other sciences such as biological sciences. Aberystwyth, Cardiff, Bangor, and Swansea have all had chairs in Welsh since their virtual establishment, and all their schools of Welsh are successful centres for the study of the Welsh language and its literature, offering a BA in Welsh as well as post-graduate courses. At all Welsh universities and the Open University, students have the right to submit assessed work and sit exams in Welsh even if the course was taught in English (usually the only exception is where the course requires demonstrating proficiency in another language). Following a commitment made in the One Wales coalition government between Labour and Plaid Cymru, the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh Language National College) was established. The purpose of the federal structured college, spread out between all the universities of Wales, is to provide and also advance Welsh medium courses and Welsh medium scholarship and research in Welsh universities. There is also a Welsh-medium academic journal called \"Gwerddon\" (\"Oasis\"), which is a platform for academic research in Welsh and is published quarterly. There have been calls for more teaching of Welsh in English-medium schools.\n\nLike many of the world's languages, the Welsh language has seen an increased use and presence on the internet, ranging from formal lists of terminology in a variety of fields to Welsh language interfaces for Windows 7, Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox and a variety of Linux distributions, and on-line services to blogs kept in Welsh. Wikipedia has had a Welsh version since July 2003 and Facebook since 2009.\n\nIn 2006 the Welsh Language Board launched a free software pack which enabled the use of SMS predictive text in Welsh. At the National Eisteddfod of Wales 2009, a further announcement was made by the Welsh Language Board that the mobile phone company Samsung was to work with the network provider Orange to provide the first mobile phone in the Welsh language, with the interface and the T9 dictionary on the Samsung S5600 available in the Welsh language. The model, available with the Welsh language interface, has been available since 1 September 2009, with plans to introduce it on other networks.\n\nOn Android devices, both the built-in Google Keyboard and user-created keyboards can be used. iOS devices have fully supported the Welsh language since the release of iOS 8 in September 2014. Users can switch their device to Welsh to access apps that are available in Welsh. Date and time on iOS is also localised, as shown by the built-in Calendar application, as well as certain third party apps that have been localized.\n\nSecure communications are often difficult to achieve in wartime. Cryptography can be used to protect messages, but codes can be broken. Therefore, lesser-known languages are sometimes encoded, so that even if the code is broken, the message is still in a language few people know. For example, Navajo code talkers were used by the United States military during World War II. Similarly, the Royal Welch Fusiliers, a Welsh regiment serving in Bosnia, used Welsh for emergency communications that needed to be secure. It has been reported that Welsh speakers from Wales and from Patagonia fought on both sides in the Falklands War.\n\nIn 2017, parliamentary rules were amended to allow the use of Welsh when the Welsh Grand Committee meets at Westminster. The change did not alter the rules about debates within the House of Commons, where only English can be used.\n\nIn February 2018, Welsh was first used when the Welsh Secretary, Alun Cairns, delivered his welcoming speech at a sitting of the committee. He said, \"I am proud to be using the language I grew up speaking, which is not only important to me, my family and the communities Welsh MPs represent, but is also an integral part of Welsh history and culture\".\n\nIn November 2008, the Welsh language was used at a meeting of the European Union's Council of Ministers for the first time. The Heritage Minister Alun Ffred Jones addressed his audience in Welsh and his words were interpreted into the EU's 23 official languages. The official use of the language followed years of campaigning. Jones said \"In the UK we have one of the world's major languages, English, as the mother tongue of many. But there is a diversity of languages within our islands. I am proud to be speaking to you in one of the oldest of these, Welsh, the language of Wales.\" He described the breakthrough as \"more than [merely] symbolic\" saying \"Welsh might be one of the oldest languages to be used in the UK, but it remains one of the most vibrant. Our literature, our arts, our festivals, our great tradition of song all find expression through our language. And this is a powerful demonstration of how our culture, the very essence of who we are, is expressed through language.\"\n\nA greeting in Welsh is one of the 55 languages included on the Voyager Golden Record chosen to be representative of Earth in NASA's Voyager program launched in 1977. The greetings are unique to each language, with the Welsh greeting being , which translates into English as \"Good health to you now and forever\".\n\nWelsh vocabulary draws mainly from original Brittonic words ( \"egg\", \"stone\"), with some loans from Latin ( \"window\" < Latin , \"wine\" < Latin ), and English ( \"shelf\", \"gate\").\n\nThe phonology of Welsh includes a number of sounds that do not occur in English and are typologically rare in European languages. The voiceless alveolar lateral fricative , the voiceless nasals , and , and the voiceless alveolar trill are distinctive features of the Welsh language. Stress usually falls on the penultimate syllable in polysyllabic words, and the word-final unstressed syllable receives a higher pitch than the stressed syllable.\n\nWelsh is written in a Latin alphabet of 29 letters, of which eight are digraphs treated as separate letters for collation:\n\nIn contrast to English practice, \"w\" and \"y\" are considered vowel letters in Welsh along with \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\" and \"u\".\n\nThe letter \"j\" was not used traditionally, but is now used in many everyday words borrowed from English, like \"jam\", \"jôc\" \"joke\" and \"garej\" \"garage\". The letters \"k\", \"q\", \"v\", \"x\", and \"z\" are used in some technical terms, like \"kilogram\", \"volt\" and \"zero\", but in all cases can be, and often are, replaced by Welsh letters: \"cilogram\", \"folt\" and \"sero.\" The letter \"k\" was in common use until the 16th century, but was dropped at the time of the publication of the New Testament in Welsh, as William Salesbury explained: \"C for K, because the printers have not so many as the Welsh requireth\". This change was not popular at the time.\n\nThe most common diacritic is the circumflex, which disambiguates long vowels, most often in the case of homographs, where the vowel is short in one word and long in the other: e.g. \"man\" \"place\" vs \"mân\" \"fine\", \"small\".\n\nWelsh morphology has much in common with that of the other modern Insular Celtic languages, such as the use of initial consonant mutations and of so-called \"conjugated prepositions\" (prepositions that fuse with the personal pronouns that are their object). Welsh nouns belong to one of two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine, but they are not inflected for case. Welsh has a variety of different endings and other methods to indicate the plural, and two endings to indicate the singular of some nouns. In spoken Welsh, verbal features are indicated primarily by the use of auxiliary verbs rather than by the inflection of the main verb. In literary Welsh, on the other hand, inflection of the main verb is usual.\n\nThe canonical word order in Welsh is verb–subject–object (VSO).\n\nColloquial Welsh inclines very strongly towards the use of auxiliaries with its verbs, as in English. The present tense is constructed with (\"to be\") as an auxiliary verb, with the main verb appearing as a verbnoun (used in a way loosely equivalent to an infinitive) after the particle \"yn\":\nThere, \"mae\" is a third-person singular present indicative form of \"bod\", and \"mynd\" is the verbnoun meaning \"to go\". The imperfect is constructed in a similar manner, as are the periphrastic forms of the future and conditional tenses.\n\nIn the preterite, future and conditional mood tenses, there are inflected forms of all verbs, which are used in the written language. However, speech now more commonly uses the verbnoun together with an inflected form of (\"do\"), so \"I went\" can be or (\"I did go\"). \"Mi\" is an example of a preverbal particle; such particles are common in Welsh.\n\nWelsh lacks separate pronouns for constructing subordinate clauses; instead, special verb forms or relative pronouns that appear identical to some preverbal particles are used.\n\nThe Welsh for \"I like Rhodri\" is (word for word, \"am I in [the] liking [of] Rhodri\"), with \"Rhodri\" in a possessive relationship with \"hoffi\". With personal pronouns, the possessive form of the personal pronoun is used, as in \"I like \"him\"\": [Dw i'n \"ei\" hoffi], literally, \"am I \"his\" liking\" – \"I like \"you\"\" is [Dw i'n \"dy\" hoffi] (\"am I \"your\" liking\").\n\nIn colloquial Welsh, possessive pronouns, whether they are used to mean \"my\", \"your\", etc. or to indicate the direct object of a verbnoun, are commonly reinforced by the use of the corresponding personal pronoun after the noun or verbnoun: \"his house\" (literally \"his house \"of him\"\"), \"I like you\" (\"I am [engaged in the action of] your liking \"of you\"\"), etc. It should be noted that the \"reinforcement\" (or, simply, \"redoubling\") adds no emphasis in the colloquial register. While the possessive pronoun alone may be used, especially in more formal registers, as shown above, it is considered incorrect to use only the personal pronoun. Such usage is nevertheless sometimes heard in very colloquial speech, mainly among young speakers: (\"Where are we going? Your house or my house?\").\n\nThe traditional counting system used in the Welsh language is vigesimal, i.e. it is based on twenties, as in standard French numbers 70 (, literally \"sixty-ten\") to 99 (, literally \"four score nineteen\"). Welsh numbers from 11 to 14 are \"\"x\" on ten\" (e.g. : 11), 16 to 19 are \"\"x\" on fifteen\" (e.g. : 16), though 18 is , \"two nines\"; numbers from 21 to 39 are \"1–19 on twenty\"(e.g. : 30), 40 is \"two twenties\", 60 is \"three twenties\", etc. This form continues to be used, especially by older people, and it is obligatory in certain circumstances (such as telling the time, and in ordinal numbers).\n\nThere is also a decimal counting system, which has become relatively widely used, though less so in giving the time, ages, and dates (it features no ordinal numbers). This system is in especially common use in schools due to its simplicity, and in Patagonian Welsh. Whereas 39 in the vigesimal system is (\"four on fifteen on twenty\") or even (\"two score minus one\"), in the decimal system it is (\"three tens nine\").\n\nAlthough there is only one word for \"one\" (), it triggers the soft mutation () of feminine nouns, where possible, other than those beginning with \"ll\" or \"rh\". There are separate masculine and feminine forms of the numbers \"two\" ( and ), \"three\" ( and ) and \"four\" ( and ), which must agree with the grammatical gender of the objects being counted. The objects being counted appear in the singular, not plural form.\n\nCurrently, there is no standardised or definitive form of the Welsh language, with significant differences in dialect marked in pronunciation, vocabulary and in points of grammar.\n\nFor example: consider the question \"Do you want a cuppa \"[a cup of tea]\"?\" In Gwynedd this would typically be while in Glamorgan one would be more likely to hear (though in other parts of the South one would not be surprised to hear as well, among other possibilities). An example of a pronunciation difference is the tendency in some southern dialects to palatalise the letter \"s\", e.g. (), usually pronounced , but as in parts of the south. This normally occurs next to a high front vowel like /i/, although exceptions include the pronunciation of \"how\" as in the southern dialects (compared with northern ).\n\nAlthough popular understanding often splits Welsh into northern (Gogledd) and southern (De) Welsh, in reality significant variation exists within these areas. The traditional classification of four Welsh 'languages', remains the most academically useful:\n\n\nA fifth 'language' is Patagonian Welsh, which has developed since the start of (the Welsh settlement in Argentina) in 1865; it includes Spanish loanwords and terms for local features, but a survey in the 1970s showed that the language in Patagonia is consistent throughout the lower Chubut valley and in the Andes.\n\nDialectal classifications exist within the 'languages' (such as the Cofi dialect). The book () was accompanied by a cassette containing recordings of fourteen different speakers demonstrating aspects of different area dialects. The book also refers to the earlier \"Linguistic Geography of Wales\" as describing six different regions which could be identified as having words specific to those regions. \n\nIn the 1970s, there was an attempt to standardise the Welsh language by teaching (\"Living Welsh\") – a colloquially-based generic form of Welsh. But the attempt largely failed because it did not encompass the regional differences used by speakers of Welsh.\n\nModern Welsh can be considered to fall broadly into two main registers—Colloquial Welsh () and Literary Welsh (). The grammar described here is that of Colloquial Welsh, which is used in most speech and informal writing. Literary Welsh is closer to the form of Welsh standardised by the 1588 translation of the Bible and is found in official documents and other formal registers, including much literature. As a standardised form, literary Welsh shows little if any of the dialectal variation found in colloquial Welsh. Some differences include:\n\nAmongst the characteristics of the literary, as against the spoken, language are a higher dependence on inflected verb forms, different usage of some of the tenses, less frequent use of pronouns (since the information is usually conveyed in the verb/preposition inflections) and a much lesser tendency to substitute English loanwords for native Welsh words. In addition, more archaic pronouns and forms of mutation may be observed in Literary Welsh.\n\nIn fact, the differences between dialects of modern spoken Welsh pale into insignificance compared to the difference between some forms of the spoken language and the most formal constructions of the literary language. The latter is considerably more conservative and is the language used in Welsh translations of the Bible, amongst other things - although the 2004 () is significantly less formal than the traditional 1588 Bible. Gareth King, author of a popular Welsh grammar, observes that \"The difference between these two is much greater than between the virtually identical colloquial and literary forms of English\". A grammar of Literary Welsh can be found in \"A Grammar of Welsh\" by Stephen J. Williams or more completely in \"Gramadeg y Gymraeg\" by Peter Wynn Thomas. (No comprehensive grammar of formal literary Welsh exists in English.) An English-language guide to colloquial Welsh forms and register and dialect differences is by Ceri Jones.\n\n\n\n"}
