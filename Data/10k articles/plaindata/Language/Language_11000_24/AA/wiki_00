Numerous methods have been devised to facilitate this. Increasing the ease of access to absentee ballots is seen by many as one way to improve voter turnout, though some countries require that a valid reason, such as infirmity or travel, be given before a voter can participate in an absentee ballot.\n\nAmong countries where voters are allocated to one or several specific polling station(s) (such as the polling station closest to the voter's residential address, or polling stations within a particular district, province or state), some countries provide a mechanism by which voters can nevertheless cast their ballots on election day at a different polling station.\n\nThe reasons for allocating voters to specific polling stations are generally logistical. Absentee voting at a different polling station might be catered for by, for example, designating some larger polling stations as available for absentee voting, and equipping such polling stations with the ballot papers (or the means to produce ballot papers) applicable to an absentee voter.\n\nIn the electoral terminology of some countries, such as Australia, \"absentee voting\" means specifically a vote cast at a different polling station to one to which the voter has been allocated. \"Early voting\", \"proxy voting\" or \"postal voting\" are separate concepts in these countries.\n\nIn a postal vote, the ballot papers are posted out to the voter – usually only on request – who must then fill them out and return them, often with some form of certification by a witness and their signature to prove their identity.\n\nTo cast a proxy vote, the user appoints someone as their \"proxy\", by authorizing them to cast or secure their vote in their stead. The proxy must be trusted by the voter, as in a secret ballot there is no way of verifying that they voted for the correct candidate. In an attempt to solve this, it is not uncommon for people to nominate an official of their chosen party as their proxy.\n\nCorporations sometimes use Internet voting in shareholder elections (i.e., \"at annual or special meetings for members of the board of directors, and on certain issues relating to the organization or governance of the company.\").\n\nIn the 2012, French citizens living abroad were permitted to cast vote electronically in French parliamentary elections (but not in presidential elections). In 2017, however, the system was dropped after the French National Cybersecurity Agency assessed an \"extremely high risk\" of cyberattacks in the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Similarly, electronic voting was banned in the Netherlands in 2007, and in 2017 Dutch authorities also abandoned electronic vote counting, conducting an all-paper, all-manual vote count in an effort to block foreign interference in its elections.\n\nIn Switzerland, six cantons are conducting an electronic voting pilot program. In three cantons, Swiss voters resident abroad may vote electronically; in the cantons of Geneva and Neuchâtel, \"some of the electorate living in the canton\" may also vote electronically. Since June 2016, in the canton of Basel Stadt, both Swiss voters resident abroad and persons with disabilities living within the canton may vote using an electronic system.\n\nSince 2005, Estonia has allowed voters to cast votes via the Internet (encrypted to protect voter anonymity); 2% of Estonians cast ballots via the Internet initially, and 25% did so in 2011. The Estonian Internet-voting system uses the Estonian national identity card, which is associated with a PINs unique to each voter: \"all Estonians are issued a government ID with a scannable chip and a PIN number that gives them a unique online identity — they can use this identity to file their taxes or pay library fines or buy bus passes.\"\n\nTexas law allows American astronauts who cannot vote in person and are unable to vote via absentee ballot such as those aboard the International Space Station and Mir space station cast their ballots electronically, via email, from orbit since 1997. Ballots are sent via secure email to the Johnson Spaceflight Center and then passed on to the astronauts' home counties in Texas. The first American to cast a ballot from space was astronaut David Wolf.\n\nIn Australia the term \"absentee ballot\" refers specifically to the procedure used when a voter attends a voting place which is not in the electoral district in which they are registered to vote. Instead of marking the ballot paper and putting it in the ballot box, the voter's ballot paper is placed in an envelope and then it is sent by the voting official to the voter's home district to be counted there.\n\nPostal voting and early voting are separate procedures also available to voters who would not be in their registered electoral districts on a voting day.\n\nIn all German elections, postal votes are available on demand. The requirement for an excuse has been removed in 2008 for elections on the federal level.\n\nAs of now, India does not have an absentee ballot system for all citizens. In a restricted sense, The Representation of the People Act-1950 (RPA) section 20(8) allows people such as people on polling duty and serving in armed forces, and Head of state like President to vote in absentia through postal means.\n\nSection 20 of the RPA-1950 disqualifies a non-resident Indian (NRI) from getting his/her name registered in the electoral rolls. Consequently, it also prevents an NRI from casting his/her vote in elections to the Parliament and to the State Legislatures. In August 2010, Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill-2010 which allows voting rights to NRI's was passed in both Lok Sabha with subsequent gazette notifications on Nov 24, 2010. With this NRI's will now be able to vote in Indian elections but have to be \"physically present\" at the time of voting. Recently several civic society organizations have urged the government to amend the RPA act to allow NRI's and people on the move to cast their vote through absentee ballot system.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, postal votes are used in Seanad Éireann elections for the university constituencies and the vocational panels, both of which have restricted franchises. Otherwise, postal voting is only available in a restricted set of circumstances. The Irish constitution requires a secret ballot and the courts have interpreted this quite narrowly. Postal votes are available to people who by reason of their occupation cannot vote normally. They are also available to students living away from home, to people with disabilities, to prisoners (since January 2007), and to long term residents of hospitals, nursing homes and other similar institutions.\n\nIsrael does not have an absentee ballot system for all citizens. Absentee ballots are restricted to soldiers, prisoners, sailors, overseas diplomats, disabled persons and hospitalized people. The votes are not cast directly but placed in a double envelope with identifying information and counted directly by the elections committee only after verifying that the voter has not voted at his official polling station. Most absentee ballots are cast the day of the elections in alternate polling stations. Early voting is limited to civil servants overseas. There is no postal voting.\n\nIn the Netherlands, liberalised proxy voting is available. Voters can authorise someone else to cast their ballot without having to go through a registration procedure. Voters can cast a maximum of 2 proxy votes along with their own ballot. Postal ballots and Internet voting are only available to Dutch citizens living abroad, or having occupational duties abroad on election day.\n\nAs provided by the Overseas Absentee Voting Act, absentee voting in Philippine elections is only available in certain circumstances, such as for Overseas Filipino Workers or other migrants. Votes must be cast in person at select polling places, such as a consulate office; mail-in ballots are an option for Filipinos in select countries. Local absentee voting as pursuant to Republic Act № 7166 and Executive Order № 157 is only available for members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, Philippine National Police, and government personnel on duty on election day. The absentee voting in both overseas and local is still manual vote counting system.\n\nRecently, absentee voting in Hong Kong and Singapore was done through the optical scan voting due to COMELEC Resolution № 8806 in the 2010 general elections.\n\nAbsentee voters can only vote for candidates elected by the entire electorate: the President, Vice President, senators, and party-list representatives.\n\nIn Poland, each citizen registered in the local voters' register, can get an \"absentee voter's certificate\" (AVC), which is a piece of paper with the person's details and the local government's stamp. The person can vote with AVC at every polling station countrywide and worldwide (in polish embassies and consulates; the polling stations abroad are created by the Minister of Foreign Affairs before every elections). An AVC is issued only for President of Poland elections, parliamentary elections and elections to the European Parliament (in that case, the AVC can be got by Polish or EU citizen, so the EU citizen can vote for polish deputees at polling station in Poland and polish embassies or consulates, or for deputees from the country of origin. Although, if the EU citizen registers himself in the polish voters' register, the local officials informs appropriate office in the country of origin). In case of Senate by-elections, AVC may be issued only for voters living and registered in given single-member constituency.\n\nA postal voting and proxy voting are also possible. Postal voting is possible both in country and abroad, but proxy voting is possible only in Poland. The proxy must be registered at the same local voters' register as a voter. The mail with the voter's ballot in postal voting is free of charge in Poland, but voter resides abroad must pay to send his ballot to the appropriate consulate.\n\nSwiss federal law allows postal voting in all federal elections and referenda, and all cantons also allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail and may either cast it at a polling station or mail it back.\n\nAbsentee balloting started in Thailand first time in the 2000 general election. It is promulgated according to a provision in the 1997 constitution. The absentee ballot can be cast within Thailand and in foreign countries, where Thailand has diplomatic missions. Voters can cast the absentee ballot in 2 cases: (1) those who have their household registration in their constituency but will not be at their constituency on the election day, and wish to cast their vote in advance; and (2) those who physically reside in other locations out of their constituency at least 90 days prior to the election day, and will not be able to travel back to their constituency on the election day. \n\nIn both cases, voters wishing to cast their absentee ballot must register with the election committee 30 days in advance prior to the general election date. Voters within Thailand can cast their vote either at the designated district offices for absentee voting in their provinces or through mail. Likewise, voters overseas can register to vote with the Thai missions in their country of residence or send the ballot to them by mail. The absentee voting date is normally designated a week ahead of the general election date. \n\nIn all United Kingdom elections, postal votes are available on demand – no reason must be given – although a vote rigging scandal involving postal votes marred the 2004 Birmingham local election.\n\nIn the United States, absentee voting takes place \"by mail-in paper ballot prior to the day of the election.\" Typically, \"the voter may return the ballot by mail or in person.\"\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures notes:\n\nAs of March 2017, an excuse is required to vote by mail in 20 states, while in 27 states and the District of Columbia, any qualified voter may vote absentee without offering an excuse. Eight states and D.C. maintain a \"permanent absentee ballot\" list; \"once a voter asks to be added to the list, s/he will automatically receive an absentee ballot for all future elections.\"\n\nThree states—Colorado, Oregon, and Washington—conduct all elections by mail, sending ballots by post to all eligible voters in each election. In 19 other states, certain elections may be held by mail. \n\nAs noted by the U.S. Postal Service's \"Domestic Mail Manual\", the voter must typically pay postage for mailing his or her absentee ballot, but \"balloting materials for any election ... must indicate in a prominent location that the proper amount of postage must be paid.\" Balloting materials may be sent via the U.S. Postal Service without prepayment of postage for \"members of the Armed Forces in active service (and their spouses and dependents)\"; \"members of the U.S. Merchant Marine and their spouses and dependents\"; and \"U.S. citizens residing outside the territorial limits of the United States and the District of Columbia and their spouses and dependents residing with or accompanying them.\"\n\nIt is sometimes inaccurately claimed that absentee ballots are not counted unless the race is close; in fact, all valid absentee ballots are counted even if they will not affect the outcome of the election.\n\nAmerican citizens who are overseas, including active members of the military, are covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act that, among other things, provides for a Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot which may be used in place of absentee ballots provided under state laws. The Federal Voting Assistance Program is a government program that assists such voters and exercises other authority under this act. This has been supplemented by the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act.\n\nIn 1997 the Texas Legislature passed a bill allowing residents to cast absentee ballots from space, because of the presence of the NASA Johnson Space Center and the astronauts that live in the Houston metropolitan area.\n\nVoting in the states of Oregon, Washington, and Colorado are unique in regards to the rest of the nation, in that voting is conducted entirely by mail. In Oregon and Washington state, counties provide drop boxes throughout the county to allow voters to drop off their ballot on or prior to election day, rather than paying postage by sending it through the mail.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "652717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=652717", "title": "All rights reserved", "text": "All rights reserved\n\n\"All rights reserved\" is a copyright formality indicating that the copyright holder \"reserves\", or holds for its own use, all the rights provided by copyright law. Originating in the Buenos Aires Convention of 1910, it no longer has any legal effect in any jurisdiction. However, it is still used by many copyright holders.\n\nThe phrase originated as a result of the Buenos Aires Convention of 1910. Article 3 of the Convention granted copyright in all signatory countries to a work registered in any signatory country, as long as a statement \"that indicates the \"reservation\" of the property \"right\"\" (emphasis added) appeared in the work. The phrase \"all rights reserved\" was not specified in the text, but met this requirement.\n\nOther copyright treaties did not require this formality. For example, in 1952 the Universal Copyright Convention (UCC) adopted the © symbol as an indicator of protection. (The symbol was introduced in the US by a 1954 amendment to the Copyright Act of 1909.) The Berne Convention rejected formalities altogether in Article 4 of the 1908 revision, so authors seeking to protect their works in countries that had signed on to the Berne Convention were also not required to use the \"all rights reserved\" formulation. However, because not all Buenos Aires signatories were members of Berne or the UCC, and in particular the United States did not join UCC until 1955, a publisher in a Buenos Aires signatory seeking to protect a work in the greatest number of countries between 1910 and 1952 would have used both the phrase \"all rights reserved\" and the copyright symbol.\n\nThe requirement to add the \"all rights reserved\" notice became essentially obsolete on August 23, 2000, when Nicaragua became the final member of the Buenos Aires Convention to also become a signatory to the Berne Convention. As of that date, every country that was a member of the Buenos Aires Convention (which is the only copyright treaty requiring this notice to be used) was also a member of Berne, which requires protection be granted without any formality of notice of copyright.\n\nThe phrase continues to hold popular currency and serves as a handy convention widely used by artists, writers, and content creators to prevent ambiguity and clearly spell out the warning that their content cannot be copied freely.\n\n"}
{"id": "20372090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20372090", "title": "Asemia", "text": "Asemia\n\nAsemia is the term for the medical condition of being unable to understand or express any signs or symbols.\nIt is a more severe condition than aphasia, which is the inability to understand linguistic signs. Asemia is caused by damage to the areas of the brain that process communication – more specifically, when there is damage to the left side of the brain in the areas that process communication such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Damage can be inflicted by physical trauma to the brain, but is more commonly caused by stroke and sometimes tumors. The onset of this condition is usually quick but not permanent. Treatment of this condition is traditional speech therapy in which the individual must relearn how to read, write, and talk. Depending on the severity of the injury, recovery can take days to years. Considerable recovery is common, but often not to the full extent of baseline ability.\n\nAsemia is a more severe condition than aphasia, so it does have some similarities with the disease. People who have asemia have the inability to comprehend signs, symbols, and even language. They also have the inability to use signs, symbols, and language. People with asemia sometimes may take up asemic writing, which is \"wordless\" writing. What wordless writing could mean is that the writing looks like regular or traditional writing, but there is no content that makes sense. The concept of syntax, semantics, or even communication does not exist in asemic writing.\n\nThe most common cause of asemia is brain damage, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Other possible causes include Alzheimer's disease and infection. Roger Wolcott Sperry, through his research of split-brain patients, had found out that the human brain lateralizes functions, meaning that the two hemispheres of the brain have different functions. Brain damage, specifically to the left hemisphere, can impair our ability to speak or understand language. This led Sperry to conclude that due to the lateralization of brain function, language is based in the left hemisphere. Therefore, any kind of brain damage to the left hemisphere will greatly impact language, whether it is expressive or receptive.\n\nSpeech therapy is usually the most common treatment for asemia. Speech therapy allows the patient to be able to improve their speaking, comprehension, and writing skills. These patients have to learn all of these skills again since they are unable to understand or express anything. It usually depends on how long it takes for the speech therapy to work. If the condition is less severe, it will take less time, such as perhaps a couple of months to years. If the condition is more severe, it may take many years. The way speech therapy works is through speech practice as well as using special computer programs which let the patient practice their communication skills. By using simple and short sentences or writing down these phrases can aid the patients while going through therapy. Giving them enough time to communicate with their friends, family, or therapist will help them increase their skills and be able to manage them.\n\nComplete success is usually achieved with treatment. However, sometimes only partial success is achieved and the patient cannot fully comprehend everything. With the partial restoration of some skills, the speech therapist may only focus on the skills which can be restored. In other cases, the therapist may work on the skills which may not retrieved and teach the patient how to handle those.\n\n"}

Famous in class x Hindi book \n\nCamille Bulcke was born in Ramskapelle, a village in Knokke-Heist municipality in the Belgian province of West Flanders \n\nBulcke had already acquired a B.Sc. degree in civil engineering from Louvain University, when he became a Jesuit in 1930 After doing his philosophical training in Valkenburg, Netherlands, (1932–34) he left for India in 1934 and after a brief stay in Darjeeling, he taught Mathematics for five years at Gumla (present Jharkhand). It was here that he developed his lifelong passion for learning Hindi, as later recalled:\n\n\"When I arrived in India in 1935, I was surprised and pained when I realised that many educated people were unaware of their cultural traditions and considered it a matter of pride to speak in English. I resolved my duty would be to master the language of the people.\" – The Faith of A Christian—Devotion To Hindi And To Tulsi.\n\nTheological training (1939–42) was undertaken in Kurseong, India, during which he was ordained priest (in 1941). His interest in the classical language of India led him to do a master's degree in Sanskrit at Calcutta University (1942–44) and finally a doctorate in Hindi literature at Allahabad University (1945–49) with a thesis titled, \"Ram Katha Ka Vikas\" (Development of the Tale of Rama).\n\nIn 1949 Bulcke was made Head of the department of Sanskrit and Hindi of St Xavier's College, Ranchi. But early hearing problems led him to go more for a scholar's than a professor's career. He felt much attracted by the 17th century's Hindi poet Tulsidas on whose writings he made his doctoral thesis. He rewrote the famous blue bird novel in Hindi under the name Neel Pakshi. Bulcke was often invited to give conferences on the Hindi poet and his devotional Rama-songs, which he did with much enthusiasm. He brought people in touch with the profound values of their own spiritual traditions, and, according to him, Tulsidas was also an excellent introduction to the values of the Gospel. He obtained Indian citizenship in 1951, and - highly esteemed by the Government of India - was made a member of the National commission for the promotion of Hindi as the national language.He came to Bihar, visited Church of Darbhanga and also praised \"the great land of divines and Mata Sita- the Mithila\" and hence he took on the name \"Bihari\" after acquiring Indian citizenship.\n\nHe died in Delhi on 17 August 1982 due to gangrene.\n\nTo fulfill zealously the onerous duties of a missionary monk, Bulcke stayed for quite some time in Darjeeling to make an in-depth study of the scriptures, being deeply interested in Philosophy, but to acquire a systematic knowledge of Indian Philosophy and Literature, he studied for his M.A. degree in Hindi from the University of Allahabad. It was, during this period of preparation for his M.A. in Allahabad that he had an occasion to read and study the \"Ramcharitmanas\" of Tulsidas. The \"Ramcharitmanas\" was a highly influential devotional book for Hindus in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was frequently read by Europeans learning Hindi. The more Bulcke studied the \"Ramcharitmanas\", the deeper became his attachment to it. His sublime sense of righteous goodness, the lofty values and ideals of its characters and its poetic excellence fascinated him to such an extent that it almost became an object of worship for him. He found a striking resemblance between the ethical aspect of righteous conduct and values of life as portrayed by the author of the \"Ramcharitmanas\" and those propounded by Jesus Christ in his discourses. He, therefore, took up a relevant topic, viz. \"Ramkatha: Utpatti Aur Vikas\" (The Tale of Rama: Origin and Development) and obtained his D.Phil degree from the University of Allahabad on the subject. His thesis was hailed by scholars all over India and his name became known to litterateurs outside the Hindi world also.\n\nHis lifelong involvement in Hindi research and translation work led him to gather material for an English-Hindi Dictionary (40,000 words) that is still the most widely used in North India. Till the end of his life he kept updating it. He prepared a life of Christ based on the four gospels, \"Muktidata\" (The Redeemer) and also translated the Bible into Hindi, as well as liturgical and devotional books. His love for the Hindi language, his imposing appearance as well as his constant willingness to help students and scholars and to listen to the simple and the distressed gave him the reputation of being a 'guru' and, for this reason, many approached him for advice even in matters that had little to do with literature.\n\n\nIn 1974, the Government of India conferred on him the Padma Bhushan, one of the premier civilian awards, second only to the Bharat Ratna and the Padma Vibhushan. The award was presented in recognition of his work in the field of literature and education.\n\n"}

{"id": "7850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7850", "title": "Chomsky normal form", "text": "Chomsky normal form\n\nIn formal language theory, a context-free grammar \"G\" is said to be in Chomsky normal form (first described by Noam Chomsky) if all of its production rules are of the form:\nwhere \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" are nonterminal symbols, \"a\" is a terminal symbol (a symbol that represents a constant value), \"S\" is the start symbol, and ε denotes the empty string. Also, neither \"B\" nor \"C\" may be the start symbol, and the third production rule can only appear if ε is in \"L\"(\"G\"), the language produced by the context-free grammar \"G\".\n\nEvery grammar in Chomsky normal form is context-free, and conversely, every context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent one which is in Chomsky normal form and has a size no larger than the square of the original grammar's size.\n\nTo convert a grammar to Chomsky normal form, a sequence of simple transformations is applied in a certain order; this is described in most textbooks on automata theory.\nThe presentation here follows Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), but is adapted to use the transformation names from Lange, Leiß (2009). Each of the following transformations establishes one of the properties required for Chomsky normal form.\n\nIntroduce a new start symbol \"S\", and a new rule \nwhere \"S\" is the previous start symbol.\nThis doesn't change the grammar's produced language, and \"S\" won't occur on any rule's right-hand side.\n\nTo eliminate each rule \nwith a terminal symbol \"a\" being not the only symbol on the right-hand side, introduce, for every such terminal, a new nonterminal symbol \"N\", and a new rule \nChange every rule \nto \nIf several terminal symbols occur on the right-hand side, simultaneously replace each of them by its associated nonterminal symbol.\nThis doesn't change the grammar's produced language.\n\nReplace each rule \nwith more than 2 nonterminals \"X\"...,\"X\" by rules \nwhere \"A\" are new nonterminal symbols.\nAgain, this doesn't change the grammar's produced language.\n\nAn ε-rule is a rule of the form \nwhere \"A\" is not \"S\", the grammar's start symbol.\n\nTo eliminate all rules of this form, first determine the set of all nonterminals that derive ε.\nHopcroft and Ullman (1979) call such nonterminals \"nullable\", and compute them as follows:\n\nObtain an intermediate grammar by replacing each rule \nby all versions with some nullable \"X\" omitted.\nBy deleting in this grammar each ε-rule, unless its left-hand side is the start symbol, the transformed grammar is obtained.\n\nFor example, in the following grammar, with start symbol \"S\",\nthe nonterminal \"A\", and hence also \"B\", is nullable, while neither \"C\" nor \"S\" is.\nHence the following intermediate grammar is obtained:\nIn this grammar, all ε-rules have been \"inlined at the call site\".\nIn the next step, they can hence be deleted, yielding the grammar:\nThis grammar produces the same language as the original example grammar, viz. {\"ab\",\"aba\",\"abaa\",\"abab\",\"abac\",\"abb\",\"abc\",\"b\",\"bab\",\"bac\",\"bb\",\"bc\",\"c\"}, but has no ε-rules.\n\nA unit rule is a rule of the form \nwhere \"A\", \"B\" are nonterminal symbols.\nTo remove it, for each rule \nwhere \"X\" ... \"X\" is a string of nonterminals and terminals, add rule \nunless this is a unit rule which has already been (or is being) removed.\n\nWhen choosing the order in which the above transformations are to be applied, it has to be considered that some transformations may destroy the result achieved by other ones. For example, START will re-introduce a unit rule if it is applied after UNIT. The table shows which orderings are admitted.\n\nMoreover, the worst-case bloat in grammar size depends on the transformation order. Using |\"G\"| to denote the size of the original grammar \"G\", the size blow-up in the worst case may range from |\"G\"| to 2, depending on the transformation algorithm used. The blow-up in grammar size depends on the order between DEL and BIN. It may be exponential when DEL is done first, but is linear otherwise. UNIT can incur a quadratic blow-up in the size of the grammar. The orderings START,TERM,BIN,DEL,UNIT and START,BIN,DEL,UNIT,TERM lead to the least (i.e. quadratic) blow-up.\n\nThe following grammar, with start symbol \"Expr\", describes a simplified version of the set of all syntactical valid arithmetic expressions in programming languages like C or Algol60. Both \"number\" and \"variable\" are considered terminal symbols here for simplicity, since in a compiler front-end their internal structure is usually not considered by the parser. The terminal symbol \"^\" denoted exponentiation in Algol60.\n\nIn step \"START\" of the above conversion algorithm, just a rule \"S\"→\"Expr\" is added to the grammar.\nAfter step \"TERM\", the grammar looks like this:\n\nAfter step \"BIN\", the following grammar is obtained:\n\nSince there are no ε-rules, step \"DEL\" doesn't change the grammar.\nAfter step \"UNIT\", the following grammar is obtained, which is in Chomsky normal form:\n\nThe \"N\" introduced in step \"TERM\" are \"PowOp\", \"Open\", and \"Close\".\nThe \"A\" introduced in step \"BIN\" are \"AddOp_Term\", \"MulOp_Factor\", \"PowOp_Primary\", and \"Expr_Close\".\n\nAnother way to define the Chomsky normal form is:\n\nA formal grammar is in Chomsky reduced form if all of its production rules are of the form:\nwhere formula_3, formula_4 and formula_5 are nonterminal symbols, and formula_6 is a terminal symbol. When using this definition, formula_4 or formula_5 may be the start symbol. Only those context-free grammars which do not generate the empty string can be transformed into Chomsky reduced form.\n\nIn a paper where he proposed a term Backus–Naur form (BNF), Donald E. Knuth implied a BNF \"syntax in which all definitions have such a form may be said to be in 'Floyd Normal Form'\",\nwhere formula_12, formula_13 and formula_14 are nonterminal symbols, and formula_6 is a terminal symbol,\nbecause Robert W. Floyd found any BNF syntax can be converted to the above one in 1961. But he withdrew this term, \"since doubtless many people have independently used this simple fact in their own work, and the point is only incidental to the main considerations of Floyd's note.\"\n\nBesides its theoretical significance, CNF conversion is used in some algorithms as a preprocessing step, e.g., the CYK algorithm, a bottom-up parsing for context-free grammars, and its variant probabilistic CKY.\n\n\n"}

Cox and is used by a number of individuals within Kodagu district of India. It is the independent dialect of Tulu. It is used for the endangered Dravidian language of Kodava, also known sometimes as \"Coorgi\".\n\nThe Coorgi–Cox alphabet uses a combination of 26 consonants, five vowel markings and a diphthong marker. Each letter represents a single sound and there are no capital letters. A computer based font has been created for use with the alphabet.\n\nThe alphabet was developed out of the request by a group of native individuals to have their own unique script for Kodava Takk, and to distinguish the language on its own merits. Kodava Takk is generally written in the Kannada script, but can also be found written in the Malayalam script especially along the borders with Kerala. The new alphabet is intended to unify, and to provide a single alphabet to be used for all Kodava Takk speakers.\n\nIn order to introduce the alphabet, 10,000 CD booklets and 25,000 post cards with various scenes from the region were produced and distributed throughout the Coorg area in March and April 2005. Several books are being planned including a phrase book and dictionary.\n"}

{"id": "44003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44003", "title": "Dysphemism", "text": "Dysphemism\n\nA dysphemism is an expression with connotations that are offensive either about the subject matter or to the audience, or both. Dysphemisms contrast with neutral or euphemistic expressions. Dysphemism is sometimes motivated by feelings such as fear, distaste, hatred, and contempt. Worded simply, a dysphemism is a derogatory or unpleasant term used instead of a pleasant or neutral one, such as \"loony bin\" for \"mental hospital\".\n\nThe word \"dysphemism\" comes from the Greek \"dys\" δύς \"mis-\" and \"pheme\" φήμη \"speech, voice, reputation\". Related terms include \"malphemism\" (from the Latin \"malus\" \"bad\"), and \"cacophemism\" (from the Greek \"kakos\" κακός \"bad\").\n\nA dysphemism is a marked form which expresses a speaker's view or attitude towards the listener or group, as opposed to a form that is typical of the speaker's speech. Thus marked forms are relative to the speaker and social context. Were a speaker to use exclusively intimate terms to address a person (e.g., the person's first name), that would be the speaker's norm. To show social distance or to express anger one would use a marked (atypical) form, for example a more formal form of address, such as adding a title or using the listener's last name.\n\nOne kind of dysphemism is synecdochic, where a part is used to represent the whole, such as \"What an asshole.\"\n\nAnimal names are frequently used as dysphemistic epithets. By using one, the speaker offends the listener by targeting his or her humanity. Examples include \"pig\", \"chicken\", \"sheep\", \"snake\", and \"rat\".\n\nWhen a person uses another's name rather than an appropriate kinship term or title of address. The speaker uses a more casual or lower style than is appropriate given the social context.\n\nThis use of language may not constitute dysphemism if the choice of words used by the speaker is welcomed by the listener, such as a father who prefers being called by his given name as opposed to \"Dad\"/\"Father\". In that case it would appeal to the listener's positive face rather than damage it, and would thus not be a dysphemism.\n\nAnger or dissatisfaction with the listener (or group of people) may compel a speaker to use a name dysphemism or term of address dysphemism.\n\nVarious slang terms that are dysphemistic in one culture may not be if they hold a different meaning in another culture. For instance, the word \"fag\" when used in American English is typically a slur against gay men. However, in British English, the word \"fag\" is usually an inoffensive term used to refer to a cigarette, or, previously, a junior boy who serves a senior boy in a British public school. Likewise, the word \"fanny\" when used in American English is a euphemism for one's buttocks, so benign that children use it. However, in British English, the word \"fanny\" is slang for vulva, and is considered to be vulgar.\n\nSome phrases that are euphemisms in certain contexts can be considered dysphemistic in others. These are often referred to as X-phemisms: whether the utterance is dysphemistic or not depending on the context of the utterance. When speaking to a close friend about death, it would be considered euphemistic to say \"he kicked the bucket\". However, if a doctor were to use this phrase after an unsuccessful operation, the phrase would be considered dysphemistic in the context of professional medicine. Likewise many X-phemisms regarding sexual intercourse could be considered euphemistic within peer groups yet dysphemistic in certain audiences. One might be more likely to say that they \"got laid\" to a friend than to one's grandparents.\n\nThere may also be instances in which conflicting definitions of the same word may lead to unintentional dysphemism. The pejorative use of the word terrorist is a salient example, as definitions of the word terrorist may vary across cultures and even within individuals in the same culture. Typically the word \"terrorist\" refers to one who uses violence and fear as a means to pursue political, religious or ideological aims. This definition is ambiguous, and many groups that refer to themselves as \"freedom fighters\", \"revolutionaries\", \"rebels\" or \"liberators\" are referred to as \"terrorists\" by dissenting parties. Labeling groups as terrorist draws associations with other groups labeled as such even when no direct connection might be present. In 2003, the Philippine government's intention to label the Moro Islamic Liberation Front as a terrorist organization was indicated by the organization to be an escalation of hostilities. It was their belief that by calling their organization a terrorist organization they were being directly compared to Al-Qaeda, with whom they claim no connection. Naming groups in this way has been described, \"A name will place emphasis on certain aspects and characteristics of an object, while neglecting or omitting other key areas\".\n\nThe interpretation and the production of a text (whether it be written, verbal, or multi-modal) depends on the previous knowledge and experience of the interpreter or producer. The individual compares matching features with representations stored in their long term memory. Certain lexical items can be used to activate these representations, conjuring stereotypical images which then become the prototype in the listener's mind. Dysphemic terms activate negative stereotypes present in the listener's memory and affect their interpretation of the given text.\n\nThe process of pejoration leads to words that were once considered euphemisms to now be considered dysphemisms. Words like \"negro\" and \"colored\" were once considered euphemisms, but have since been replaced by terms like \"black\" and \"African-American\". Sometimes slight modifications of dysphemisms can make them acceptable: while \"colored people\" is considered dysphemistic, \"people of color\" does not carry the same connotations.\nThe words \"idiot\" and \"moron\" were once polite terms to refer to people with mental disabilities, but they are now rarely used without dysphemism. Likewise, the word \"retarded\" was introduced as a new polite form once the previous terms were outdated. Since then \"retard\" has been used dysphemistically, suggesting that this term might now be outdated as well. Often a word with both taboo and non-taboo meanings becomes restricted to the taboo definition alone. The term \"euphemism treadmill\", coined by Steven Pinker, describes this process, in which terms with an emotionally charged referent that were once euphemisms become dysphemistic by association with the referent.\n\n\"Nigger\" would typically be dysphemistic; however, if used between African-Americans it may be seen as neutral (although extremely casual) by the listener, depending on his/her social distance from the speaker and perceived status relative to the other party; see Nigga.\n\nReclamations of taboo terms have been both successful and unsuccessful. The term \"chicano\" was a derogatory term and has been successfully reclaimed. Some terms like \"Yankee\" (for an American) or \"punk\" for a late 1970s rocker, began as derogatory but were not considered such and adopted proudly by the named group. Movements to reclaim words for homosexuals such as \"queer\", \"fag\" and \"dyke\" are also noteworthy.\n\nOf note are historic examples of dysphemism reclamation; for instance, the term Impressionism originated as a critical remark that \"Monet's \"Impression, Sunrise\" was not art, it was an impression\", but was adopted to be the formal name of the style, and was accepted by the artists themselves.\n\nTaboo terms are used as insults, epithets, and expletives because they damage the listener's face, which might destroy social harmony — especially if the speaker and listener are socially distant from one another. For this reason, terms of insult are socially taboo and dysphemistic. Breaking a social taboo can act as an emotional release, with the illocutionary act of expressing a feeling or attitude.\n\nBad or taboo words for many things far outnumber the \"good\" words. Hugh Rawson notices in his book \"Wicked Words\" that when looking at Roget's International Thesaurus, there are \"...89 synonyms for drunk, compared to 16 for sober, and 206 for bad person compared to 82 for good person. The synonyms for unchastity in the Thesaurus fill 140 lines, occupying exactly four times as much space as those for chastity. For unchaste woman, 34 synonyms are listed, for unchaste man, 24. No synonyms at all are given for chaste woman and chaste man.\"\n\nBodily effluvia, or bodily excretions, are perennial targets for dysphemy. Many communities historically believed that bodily effluvia such as feces (faeces), spittle, blood, nail-parings, and hair-clippings were cursed. Such revulsion is apparently learned: children and animals are not put off by bodily effluvia (unless they have a foul smell). In a study done at Monash and La Trobe Universities in Melbourne, Australia, subjects rated bodily effluvia according to how revolting they found them. Feces, vomit, semen and menstrual blood were rated as most revolting while nail parings, breath, blood from a wound, hair clippings, and breast milk were rated as least revolting. This continuum of the level of revulsion is apparent in certain dysphemism such as \"shitter\" for \"toilet\", \"to come off\" for \"to ejaculate\", and \"puke hole\" for \"tavern\" or \"toilet\".\n\n"}

It was given this name because it is the first of four grammatical works bound in the Icelandic manuscript \"Codex Wormianus\". The anonymous author is today often referred to as the \"First Grammarian\".\n\nThis work is one of the earliest written works in Icelandic (and in any North Germanic language). It is a linguistic work dealing with Old Norse, in the tradition of Latin and Greek grammatical treatises, generally dated to the mid-12th century. Hreinn Benediktsson was not able to narrow the time of writing more precisely than to 1125–1175.\n\nThe First Grammatical Treatise was of great interest to some mid-20th century linguists, since it systematically used the technique of minimal pairs to establish the inventory of distinctive sounds or phonemes in the Icelandic language, in a manner reminiscent of the methods of structural linguistics. It is also notable for revealing the existence of a whole series of nasal vowel phonemes, whose presence in the Icelandic language of the time would otherwise be unknown.\n\nThe \"Treatise\" is important for the study of Old Norse, as it is a major text showing the state of the language just prior to the writing of the Icelandic Sagas. It also provides a comprehensive study of the pronunciation of the language, to the extent that it created an Icelandic alphabet derived from the Latin, and more adapted to writing on paper or parchment than the older, epigraphic Runic alphabet that was made for shorter carvings on wood or stone. (Other writings in the Latin alphabet presumably existed in the form of law books and Christian writings. The educated clergy of the time would not have used runes.) This alphabet included þ (derived straight from the runes), as well as diacritic indication of vowel length, and an o with an ogonek (at the time an independent phoneme, but by now merged with \"ö\"). The \"First Grammarian's\" entire system was never adopted, as evidenced in later manuscripts, in some cases not much younger, but it has had an influence on Icelandic writing ever since (see above). See Icelandic orthography.\n\nLong vowels are marked with an acute, e.g. á. For the nasals, this replaces the dot. Small capitals denote a geminate consonant. Ǥ, named \"eng\", denotes .\n\nRaddarstafir (Vowels): a, ȧ, ǫ, ǫ̇, e, ė, ę, ę̇, ı, i, o, ȯ, ø, ø̇, u, u̇, y, ẏ\n\nSamhljóðendr (Consonants): b, ʙ, c, ᴋ, d, ᴅ, f, ꜰ, g, ɢ, ǥ, h, l, ʟ, m, ᴍ, n, ɴ, p, ᴘ, r, ʀ, ſ, ꜱ, t, ᴛ, þ\n\nSamsettar (Letters for composite sounds): x, z\n\nOther: ⁊, ˜\n\nThe author is unknown, and is usually referred to as \"First Grammarian\". Scholars have hypothesized various identities for the First Grammarian. One probable candidate is Hallr Teitsson (born ca. 1085, died 1150). Þóroddr Gamlason has also been suggested.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7286347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7286347", "title": "History of the Latin script", "text": "History of the Latin script\n\nThe Latin script is the most widely used alphabetic writing system in the world. It is the standard script of the English language and is often referred to simply as \"the alphabet\" in English. It is a true alphabet which originated in the 7th century BC in Italy and has changed continually over the last 2500 years. It has roots in the Semitic alphabet and its offshoot alphabets, the Phoenician, Greek, and Etruscan. The phonetic values of some letters changed, some letters were lost and gained, and several writing styles (\"hands\") developed. Two such styles, the minuscule and majuscule hands, were combined into one script with alternate forms for the lower and upper case letters. Due to classicism, modern uppercase letters differ only slightly from their classical counterparts. There are few regional variants.\n\nThe Latin alphabet started out as uppercase serifed letters known as roman square capitals. The lowercase letters evolved through cursive styles that developed to adapt the formerly inscribed alphabet to being written with a pen. Throughout the ages, many dissimilar stylistic variations of each letter have evolved that are still identified as being the same letter.\nAfter the evolution of the alphabet from the Western Greek Alphabet through Old Italic alphabet, G developed from C, the letter J developed from a flourished I, V and U split and the ligature of VV became W, the letter thorn Þ was introduced from the runic alphabet but was lost in all languages except Icelandic, and the letter s could be written either as a long s (ſ) inside a word or as a terminal s at the end or after a long s (ß) after the 7th century AD, but the long s was generally abandoned in the 19th century.\n\nHowever, thanks to classical revival, Roman capitals were reintroduced by humanists making Latin inscriptions easily legible to modern readers while many medieval manuscripts are unreadable to an untrained modern reader, due to unfamiliar letterforms, narrow spacing and abbreviation marks with some exceptions of some marks such as the apostrophe and the exception of Carolingian minuscule letters (lower caps) which were mistaken for Roman.\n\nAdditionally the phonetic value of the letters has changed from its origins and is not constant across the languages adopting the Latin alphabet, such as English or French, often the orthography does not fully match the phonetics, resulting in Homophonic heterographs (words written differently but sounding the same) such as in English and adopting digraphs for new sounds, such as sh for Voiceless postalveolar fricative in English.\n\nIt is generally held that the Latins adopted the western variant of the Greek alphabet in the 7th century BC from Cumae, a Greek colony in southern Italy – making the early Latin alphabet one among several Old Italic alphabets emerging at the time.\n\nFrom the Cumae alphabet, the Etruscan alphabet was derived. The Latins ultimately adopted 21 of the original 26 Etruscan letters.\n\nGaius Julius Hyginus, who recorded much Roman mythology, mentions in \"Fab. 277\" the legend that it was Carmenta, the Cimmerian Sibyl, who altered fifteen letters of the Greek alphabet to become the Latin alphabet, which her son Evander introduced into Latium, supposedly 60 years before the Trojan War, but there is no historically sound basis to this tale.\n\nThe original Latin alphabet was:\nThe oldest Latin inscriptions do not distinguish between and , representing both by C, K and Q according to position. K was used before A; Q was used (if at all) before O or V; C was used elsewhere. This is explained by the fact that the Etruscan language did not make this distinction. C originated as a turned form of Greek Gamma (Γ) and Q from Greek Koppa (Ϙ). In later Latin, K survived only in a few forms such as \"Kalendae\"; Q survived only before V (representing ), and C was used everywhere else. G was later invented to distinguish between and ; it was originally simply a C with an additional diacritic.\n\n\nK was marginalized in favour of C, which afterward stood for both /ɡ/ and /k/.\n\nProbably during the 3rd century BC, the Z was dropped and a new letter G was placed in its position – according to Plutarch, by Spurius Carvilius Ruga – so that afterward, C = /k/, G = /ɡ/.\n\nAn attempt by the emperor Claudius to introduce three additional letters was short-lived, but after the conquest of Greece in the 1st century BC the letters Y and Z were, respectively, adopted and readopted from the Greek alphabet and placed at the end. Now the new Latin alphabet contained 23 letters:\n\nThe Latin names of some of the letters are disputed. In general, however, the Romans did not use the traditional (Semitic-derived) names as in Greek, but adopted the simplified names of the Etruscans, which derived from saying the sounds of the letters: the vowels stood for themselves, the names of the stop consonant letters were formed by adding the neutral vowel \"e\", which in Latin became (except for K and Q, which were distinguished from C by appending the vowel which followed them in Etruscan orthography), and the names of the continuant consonants were formed by preceded the sound with . X was named rather than , as could not begin a word in Latin (and possibly Etruscan). When the letter Y was introduced into Latin, it was probably called \"hy\" as in Greek (the name upsilon being not yet in use), but was changed to \"i Graeca\" (\"Greek i\") as Latin speakers had difficulty distinguishing the sounds and . Z was given its Greek name, zeta, when it was borrowed. For the Latin sounds represented by the various letters see Latin spelling and pronunciation; for the names of the letters in English see English alphabet and for the sounds in English see English phonetics.\n\nRoman cursive script, also called majuscule cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the Latin alphabet, and even by emperors issuing commands. A more formal style of writing was based on Roman square capitals, but cursive was used for quicker, informal writing. It was most commonly used from about the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD, but it probably existed earlier than that.\n\nThe Latin alphabet spread from Italy, along with the Latin language, to the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea with the expansion of the Roman Empire. The eastern half of the Roman Empire, including Greece, Asia Minor, the Levant, and Egypt, continued to use Greek as a lingua franca, but Latin was widely spoken in the western half of the Empire, and as the western Romance languages, including French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Catalan, evolved out of Latin they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe lower case (minuscule) letters developed in the Middle Ages from New Roman Cursive writing, first as the uncial script, and later as minuscule script. The old Roman letters were retained for formal inscriptions and for emphasis in written documents. The languages that use the Latin alphabet generally use capital letters to begin paragraphs and sentences and for proper nouns. The rules for capitalization have changed over time, and different languages have varied in their rules for capitalization. Old English, for example, was rarely written with even proper nouns capitalised; whereas Modern English of the 18th century had frequently all nouns capitalised, in the same way that Modern German is today.\n\nThe use of the letters I and V for both consonants and vowels proved inconvenient as the Latin alphabet was adapted to Germanic and Romance languages. W originated as a doubled V (VV) used to represent the sound found in Old English as early as the 7th century. It came into common use in the later 11th century, replacing the runic Wynn letter which had been used for the same sound. In the Romance languages, the minuscule form of V was a rounded \"u\"; from this was derived a rounded capital U for the vowel in the 16th century, while a new, pointed minuscule \"v\" was derived from V for the consonant. In the case of I, a word-final swash form, \"j\", came to be used for the consonant, with the un-swashed form restricted to vowel use. Such conventions were erratic for centuries. J was introduced into English for the consonant in the 17th century (it had been rare as a vowel), but it was not universally considered a distinct letter in the alphabetic order until the 19th century.\n\nThe names of the letters were largely unchanged, with the exception of H. As the sound disappeared from the Romance languages, the original Latin name \"hā\" became difficult to distinguish from A. Emphatic forms such as and were used, developing eventually into \"acca\", the direct ancestor of English \"aitch\".\n\nWith the spread of printing, several styles of Latin typography emerged with fonts based on various minuscules of the Middle Ages depending on the region. In Germany, starting with Johannes Gutenberg the commonly used typefaces were based on blackletter scripts, a tradition that lasted until the 20th century, an example of the later typefaces used is fraktur.\n\nIn Italy, due to the revival of classical culture, the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by \"Venetian\" Latin types, also called antiqua, which were based on the inscriptional capitals on Roman buildings and monuments. However, humanist scholars of the early 15th century mistook Carolingian minuscule as the authentic writing style of the Romans and redesigned the small Carolingian letter, lengthening ascenders and descenders, and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals. By the time moveable type reached Italy several decades later, the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as humanistic minuscule, which served as the basis for Venetian typeface.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned square capitals used in architecture, in the Roman empire and in the Middle Ages for rapidly written vernacular documents roman cursive or even a form of shorthand, called tironian notes, were used.\n\nWhereas the meticulously drawn textualis quadrata was the most common script for religious works, starting from the 13th century a common style of handwriting for vernacular work, which were written at speed, was Secretary hand, a cursive script, which features amongst several ligatures and contraction distinctive strong \"elephant's ear\" ascenders and descenders\n\nIn the 16th–17th century secretary hand was slowly replaced by italic scripts, a semi-cursive group of scripts. Early italic hand, dating from the 15th century, was based on humanist minuscule with pronounced serifs, a single story a, open tailed g, slight forward slope and in the late renaissance could have been written with flourishes and swashes.\nItalic hand developed into Cancelleresca (chancery) corsiva (also an italic script) used for Vatican documents from the middle of the 16th century, which featured a more prominent slope and lavish swashes (often curled) on capitals.<br>\nAdditionally this script led to the italic type in typography, which could be used within a text written in Roman type (\"e.g.\" \"The taxonomic name of the red fox is \"Vulpes vulpes\"\") and thanks to Edward Johnston this script has enjoyed a revival in the 20th century.<br>\nNote: \"Italic hand\" (a semi-cursive script), \"Ital\"ian\" hand\" (a copperplate cursive script) and \"Italic \"type\"\" (a typeface) are different concepts.\n\nFrom the italic scripts after the 16th century, more cursive forms evolved and were known as Copperplate script due to way the calligraphy books were printed and reached their height in the 18–19th century. The main examples were the Italian hand and the English round-hand, which in Britain were taught to men and women respectively, these scripts feature flowing letters which could be written with a single pen lift (with the exception of x and the marks added after writing the word which were dots on i and j and the bar of the ascender of t) with straight or looped ascenders and descenders. In Italy Italian hand is instead known as \"posata\" (posed).\nSeveral national styles of cursive were developed, such as Spencerian Script in the US. Despite the recent decline, in several countries cursive scripts are still taught in schools today, often modified to be more similar to roman type letters (tailless z, w-like instead of a 90° CW turned s for w, capitals without \"belly\" or swashes, forward-facing capital F etc.).\n\nWith the spread of Western Christianity the Latin alphabet spread to the peoples of northern Europe who spoke Germanic languages, displacing their earlier Runic alphabets, as well as to the speakers of Baltic languages, such as Lithuanian and Latvian, and several (non-Indo-European) Uralic languages, most notably Hungarian, Finnish and Estonian. During the Middle Ages the Latin alphabet also came into use among the peoples speaking West Slavic languages, including the ancestors of modern Poles, Czechs, Croats, Slovenes, and Slovaks, as these peoples adopted Roman Catholicism. Speakers of East Slavic languages generally adopted both Orthodox Christianity and Cyrillic script.\n\nAs late as 1492, the Latin alphabet was limited primarily to the languages spoken in western, northern and central Europe. The Orthodox Christian Slavs of eastern and southeastern Europe mostly used the Cyrillic alphabet, and the Greek alphabet was still in use by Greek-speakers around the eastern Mediterranean. The Arabic alphabet was widespread within Islam, both among Arabs and non-Arab nations like the Iranians, Indonesians, Malays, and Turkic peoples. Most of the rest of Asia used a variety of Brahmic alphabets or the Chinese script.\n\nBy the 18th century, the standard Latin alphabet comprised the 26 letters we are familiar with today.\n\nDuring colonialism, the alphabet began its spread around the world, being employed for previously unwritten languages, notably in the wake of Christianization, being used in Bible translations. It spread to the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific, along with the Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, and Dutch languages.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Romanians adopted the Latin alphabet; although Romanian is a Romance language, the Romanians were predominantly Orthodox Christians, and until the 19th century the Church used the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet. Vietnam, under French rule, adapted the Latin alphabet for Vietnamese, which had previously used Chinese characters. The Latin alphabet is also used for many Austronesian languages, including Tagalog and the other languages of the Philippines, and the official Malaysian and Indonesian, replacing earlier Arabic and indigenous Brahmic alphabets.\n\nIn 1928, as part of Kemal Atatürk's reforms, Turkey adopted the Latin alphabet for the Turkish language, replacing the Arabic alphabet. Most of Turkic-speaking peoples of the former USSR, including Tatars, Bashkirs, Azeri, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and others, used the Uniform Turkic alphabet in the 1930s. In the 1940s all those alphabets were replaced by Cyrillic. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, several of the newly independent Turkic-speaking republics adopted the Latin alphabet, replacing Cyrillic. Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan have officially adopted the Latin alphabet for Azeri, Uzbek, and Turkmen, respectively. In the 1970s, the People's Republic of China developed an official transliteration of Mandarin Chinese into the Latin alphabet, called Pinyin, used to aid children and foreigners in learning the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Aside from that, Chinese characters are used for reading and writing.\n\nWest Slavic and most South Slavic languages use the Latin alphabet rather than the Cyrillic, a reflection of the dominant religion practiced among those peoples. Among these, Polish uses a variety of diacritics and digraphs to represent special phonetic values, as well as l with stroke – ł – for a w-like sound. Czech uses diacritics as in Dvořák – the term háček (\"little hook\") is Czech. Croatian and the Latin version of Serbian use carons, or háčeks, in č, š, ž, an acute in ć and a bar in đ. The languages of Eastern Orthodox Slavs generally use Cyrillic instead which is much closer to the Greek alphabet. Serbian, however, actively uses both alphabets.\n\n"}
{"id": "2172378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2172378", "title": "Independent politician", "text": "Independent politician\n\nAn independent or nonpartisan politician is an individual politician not affiliated with any political party. There are numerous reasons why someone may stand for office as an independent.\n\nSome independent politicians may be associated with a political party, perhaps as former members of it, or else have views that align with it, but choose not to stand in its name, or are unable to do so because the party in question has selected another candidate. Others may belong to or support a political party at the national level but believe they should not formally represent it (and thus be subject to its policies) at another level.\n\nIn running for public office, independents sometimes choose to form a party or alliance with other independents, and may formally register their party or alliance. Even where the word \"independent\" is used, such alliances have much in common with a political party, especially if there is an organization which needs to approve the \"independent\" candidates.\n\nIndependents are a recurrent feature of the federal Parliament of Australia, and they are more commonly elected to state parliaments. There have been up to five independents in every federal parliament since 1990, and independents have won twenty-eight times during national elections in that time. A large proportion of independents are former members of one of Australia's four main parties, the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, the Australian Greens, or the National Party of Australia. In 2013 a political party named the Australian Independents was registered with the Australian Electoral Commission.\n\nAs at 2017, two independents sit in the Australian House of Representatives, Andrew Wilkie from Denison in Tasmania (former Greens candidate) and Cathy McGowan from Indi in Victoria.\n\nIndependent Senators are quite rare. In modern politics, independent Brian Harradine served from 1975 to 2005 with considerable influence at times. Nick Xenophon has been the only elected independent Senator since his election to the Senate at the 2007 federal election. Xenophon was re-elected for another six-year term at the 2013 federal election. DLP Senator John Madigan became an independent Senator in September 2014, while PUP Senators Jacqui Lambie and Glenn Lazarus became independent Senators in November 2014 and March 2015.\n\nThe independent politicians are not allowed to run for offices in Brazil. The Constitution of 1988, in its Article 14, §3rd, item V, says that \"Are conditions for eligibility: V - party affiliation.\" However, the Proposal Amendment to the Constitution (PEC) no. 6/2015, authored by senator José Reguffe, would allow the independent candidacy of individuals who have the support of at least 1% of the electors able to vote in the region (city, state or country, depending on the election) in which the candidate is running. Currently, members of the legislative and executive can leave their respective parties after elected, as is the case of senator Reguffe, who left the Democratic Labour Party (PDT) in 2016.\n\nThe President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev is an independent with support from the Bulgarian Socialist Party. Radev was elected in the 2016 election.\n\nIndependent Members of Parliament were numerous in the last decades of the 19th century but diminished as the party system solidified. It remained common, however, to have a small number of Independent Liberal or Independent Conservative MPs into the 1950s.\n\nIndependent politicians have held considerable sway in the House of Commons of Canada in recent years as Canada has been governed by successive minority governments with independent Members of Parliament (MPs) sometimes sharing in the balance of power.\n\nIn the 2004 federal election, Chuck Cadman was elected to federal parliament as an independent MP representing the British Columbia riding of Surrey North. Cadman had previously represented that riding on behalf of the Reform Party of Canada and Canadian Alliance, but after the Canadian Alliance merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to form the new Conservative Party of Canada in 2003, Cadman lost the nomination to represent the Conservative Party in that riding to Jasbir Singh Cheema. Cadman then stood in the subsequent election as an independent and defeated Cheema, as well as the candidates of other Canadian parties, by a significant margin.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, Cadman cast the tying vote in favour of a budget supported by the Liberal Party government of Paul Martin as well as the New Democratic Party (NDP), but opposed by the opposition Conservatives and Bloc Québécois. Two other independents also voted on that budget. Carolyn Parrish, independent MP for Mississauga—Erindale, had recently been kicked out of the Liberal Party for criticizing US president George W Bush, but nonetheless sided with the Liberals on the budget vote. David Kilgour independent MP for Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont, had previously quit the Liberal caucus and voted with the opposition parties against the budget. The tie vote required the Speaker of the House Peter Milliken to cast the deciding vote, and he did so in favor of the budget, allowing the government to survive.\n\nCadman was terminally ill with cancer at the time he cast his crucial vote, and he died later in 2005. In the 2006 federal election, his riding was won by NDP candidate Penny Priddy. Neither Parrish nor Kilgour (nor Pat O'Brien, MP for London—Fanshawe, who quit the Liberal Party to sit as an independent after the 2005 budget vote) stood for re-election in 2006.\n\nAnother independent candidate, André Arthur, was elected in the Quebec riding of Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier in 2006, and was the only independent to win a seat in that election. He was re-elected in the October 14, 2008 federal election. Former Progressive Conservative and Conservative MP Bill Casey, who was expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against the 2007 Federal Budget, also ran as an independent in the 2008 election, easily retaining his seat.\n\nCandidates in federal elections who are not affiliated with a party have two options: independent or no affiliation. In the former case, they appear on the ballot with \"Independent\" following their name; in the second case, they appear with their name only. The two options are otherwise equivalent.\n\nThe territorial legislatures of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are consensus governments with no political parties, so that all members sit as independents. There are a few independent members of the other subnational legislatures, which are similar in principle to the federal House of Commons; for example, in the 2009 election in British Columbia, independent candidate Vicki Huntington narrowly defeated incumbent Attorney General Wally Oppal as MLA for Delta South.\n\nTrue independents should not be confused with members of parties without official party status in a legislature. Most legislatures provide that a party must hold a certain number of seats to enjoy certain advantages in staffing, budget, ability to ask questions in Question Period, and the like. Although members whose parties do not hold this status may have no more privileges than independent members, they remain representatives of political parties.\n\nAlso, members who are expelled from or choose to leave their party caucus may sit as \"Independent\" with some designation, e.g., \"Independent Liberal\" or \"Independent Conservative\", to indicate their affiliation to that party even if it is not officially recognized.\n\nElection as an independent is far more common at the municipal level. Many municipalities have no tradition of political parties.\n\nAfter an inconclusive election in 2015, Tihomir Orešković was named the first non-partisan Prime Minister of Croatia.\n\nAfter serving six years on his first term as President of Finland in the National Coalition Party from 2012 to 2018, Sauli Niinistö was elected for his second term in 2018 after running as an independent candidate.\n\nIn France, independent politicians are frequently categorised as \"sans étiquette\" (\"without label\") in municipal or district elections. However, it is rare to have independent politicians at national level, notably José Bové in the 2007 presidential election. Emmanuel Macron was an independent politician as Minister, but formed his own party to stand in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn 1920, Alexandre Millerand was elected president of the Republic under the banner \"without label\".\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008 \"without label\" was no longer used in the nomenclature of the Ministry of the Interior. Candidates and lists presenting themselves as \"without label\" are classified in DVG (various left), DVD (various right), DVC (various center) or AUT (other) according to their political sensitivity. Therefore, from 2008 onwards, the DIV (miscellaneous) or the LDIV code for the \"miscellaneous\" list has been created to group unclassifiable or categorical interests and, by default, mayors without a declared label claiming No political sensitivity, be it left, center or right. The AUT (other) grade replaces the DIV grade without changing its definition.\n\nOn 28 October Salome Zurabishvili runs in the 2018 presidential elections as an independent candidate to become first-ever female president of Georgia.\n\nJoachim Gauck, President of Germany from March 2012 to March 2017 and the first Federal President without party affiliation, was to date the most prominent Independent politician. In the German presidential election of 2010 he was the candidate of the Social Democrats and Greens, in 2012 the candidate of all major parties except The Left. His presidency—though his powers are limited—constitutes an exception, as Independent politicians have rarely held high office in German history, at least not since World War II. It has nevertheless happened that a presidential candidate without any chances of election by the Federal Convention was not a party member: for example, when in 1984 the Greens came up with the writer Luise Rinser.\n\nIn the Bundestag parliament nearly all deputies belong to a political party. The voting system of personalized proportional representation (since 1949) allows any individual holding the passive right to vote to stand for a direct mandate in the electoral districts—half of the seats in parliament are distributed by districts according to a plurality voting system. Such a candidate has to present 200 signatures in favor of his candidacy, the same as a candidate of a party that had no parliamentary presentation previously. The first Bundestag election in 1949 saw three independents elected; since then, no party-independent candidate has won a seat. At state level, the situation is more or less the same: only party members have a real chance to be elected to a Landtag legislature, and state ministers without party membership are just as rare as at the federal level. However, in local elections it may occur that an independent politician is elected deputy to districts', cities' and municipalities' assemblies, as well as member of a city council or even mayor, especially in Northern Germany. In recent years, independents have formed Free Voters associations to enter Landtag parliaments, so far only successful in Bavaria.\n\nAn independent MP, who also is not a member of a voters' association, holds the status of a \"non-inscrit\" () not affiliated to any parliamentary group. A representative who leaves his party (and his parliamentary group) and does not join another becomes an independent and \"non-inscrit\". In 1989 the Bundestag MP Thomas Wüppesahl, who had left the Green Party in 1987 and was excluded from the Green parliamentary group the next year, obtained more rights as a non-inscrit, for example more talking time and representation in a subcommittee, when the Federal Constitutional Court decided partially in his favor.\n\nAfter the German unification of 1871, the first Reich Chancellors (heads of government) \"de jure\" served as executive officers of the German Imperial states as non-partisans, usually recruited from the traditional bureaucratic, aristocratic and/or military elites. In the fierce political conflicts during the Weimar period after World War I, several chancellors and Reich Ministers also had no party affiliation: these chancellors were Wilhelm Cuno (1922–1923), Hans Luther (1925–1926), the former Centre politician Franz von Papen (1932), and Kurt von Schleicher (1932–1933). The last two cabinets appointed by Reich President Paul von Hindenburg, a non-partisan (though strongly Conservative) himself, were regarded as apolitical cabinets of experts with regard to the rise of the Nazi Party; many of the ministers were not party members.\n\nSince World War II, only two ministers of (West) German cabinets have not been party members, though \"on the ticket\" of the major party in the coalition, the Social Democrats: Education Minister Hans Leussink (1969–1972), and Minister of Economy Werner Müller (1998–2002). Minister of Justice Klaus Kinkel only shortly after his appointment joined the Free Democrats in 1991. A special case is the former Federal Minister and Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, whose affiliation with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has not been conclusively established: although he served as Minister of Economics from 1949 to 1963 and as Federal Chancellor from 1963 to 1966, and was even elected CDU party chairman in 1966, it seems that he never signed a membership form or paid contributions. Researches by \"Der Stern\" magazine have revealed a record at the CDU party archives created only in 1968, with the faked date of entry of early March 1949.\n\nMore than half of Hong Kong's Legislative Council is made up of independents, or members whose political groups are represented by one sole member in the legislature. They are common in functional constituencies, and are not rare among geographical constituencies.\n\nThe President of Iceland (currently Guðni Th. Jóhannesson) is independent.\n\nIndependent candidate contest elections on the basis of their personal appeal or to promote an ideology different from any party. Some are also run as independent candidates after being sidelined by political rivals within their own party, or to ensure that a rival candidate is not elected. While some are genuine candidates, others have been criticised as dummy candidates put forward by political parties to get around the spending ceiling imposed by the Election Commission, or to confuse voters by using party names similar to those of another candidate. \n\nAfter the Irish general election in 2016, there were 19 independent TDs (Members of Parliament) in the Dáil (the lower house of the Irish parliament), representing 12% of the total. 4 TDs also sit for a registered party called Independents4Change. A grouping of independents, the Independent Alliance has agreed to support the minority Government with a number of other individual independents similarly agreeing and receiving cabinet positions.\n\nThere are fourteen independent senators in the 25th Seanad (the upper house of the Irish parliament), representing 23% of the total. Three of these are elected by the graduates of the National University of Ireland and two from Dublin University. There are also five independent senators who were nominated by the Taoiseach and four elected by the technical panels.\n\nBoth of these are record highs for independents\n\nThe Prime Ministers Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (1993–1994), Lamberto Dini (1995–1996), Giuliano Amato (2000–2001), Mario Monti (2011–2013) and Giuseppe Conte (2018–present) were independent when they were in office. Ciampi was also the President of the Italian Republic between 1999 and 2006.\n\nIn Kosovo, Atifete Jahjaga was elected the first female and Independent President of Kosovo. She was also the first female and independent elected leader in the whole of the Balkans.\n\nIndependents have rarely been elected to the Dewan Rakyat and state legislative assemblies. In Malaysian elections, many independent candidates lose their election deposit because they had failed to secure at least 12.5% or one-eighth of the total votes cast. Independent Senators are quite rare.\n\nIn 2010, a group of independent MPs who were sacked from the People's Justice Party formed a political block called \"Konsensus Bebas\". The members were Zahrain Mohamed Hashim (Bayan Baru), Wee Choo Keong (Wangsa Maju), Zulkifli Noordin (Kulim-Bandar Bharu), Tan Tee Beng (Nibong Tebal) dan Mohsin Fadzli Samsuri (Bagan Serai). It did not last beyond the 12th General Elections.\n\n, five independent politician sits in the Dewan Rakyat.\n\nJaime Heliodoro Rodríguez Calderón (born in 1957), sometimes referred to by his nickname \"El Bronco\", is a Mexican politician who is the current governor for the northern state of Nuevo León and holds no political party affiliation. elected Governor for Nuevo León, making history as the first independent candidate to win in the country.\n\nOriginally, there were no recognised parties in the New Zealand parliament, although loose groupings did exist informally (initially between supporters of central government versus provincial governments, and later between liberals and conservatives). The foundation of formal political parties, starting at the end of the 19th century, considerably diminished the number of unaffiliated politicians, although a smaller number of independent candidates continued to be elected up until the 1940s. Since then, however, there have been relatively few independent politicians in Parliament. No independent candidate has won or held a seat in a general election since 1943, although two independent candidates have been successful in by-elections (in all cases after having held the seats in question as partisan candidates up until that point). Other politicians have become independents in the course of a parliamentary term, but not been voted into office as such.\n\nThe last person to be directly elected to Parliament as an independent in New Zealand was Winston Peters, who won the in electorate as an independent after having previously held it a member of the National Party. By the time of the next general election, he had formed his own party (New Zealand First), and thus was no longer standing as an independent. Since that time, the only independents in Parliament have been people who quit or were expelled from their original party but retained their seats without going through a by-election. Some have gone on to found or co-found their own parties, with varying levels of success — examples include Peter Dunne, Taito Phillip Field, Gordon Copeland, Tau Henare, and Alamein Kopu. Others have joined parties which were then outside Parliament, such as Frank Grover and Tuariki Delamere.\n\nThere were two independent MPs in the last Parliament; Chris Carter and Hone Harawira. Carter became an independent after his criticisms of the Labour Party's leadership resulted in his being expelled from the Labour caucus, while Harawira resigned from the Māori Party and, after a short period as an independent, also resigned as an MP in order to force the when he was re-elected as representative of his new political party, Mana and retained the seat in the 2011 General Election. There are also two parties other which have only a single MP United Future with Peter Dunne and ACT with David Seymour. Neither Dunne nor Seymour are classed as independents — Dunne's presence in Parliament is due to personal votes in his home electorate, and Seymour's presence is as the sole elected MP of ACT because of a collapse in their support in the . In the 50th New Zealand Parliament there was one independent MP: Brendan Horan, a former New Zealand First MP who was expelled from his party because of allegations of misappropriation of family assets.\n\nPeter Dunne effectively became an Independent MP for a short period after his United Future political party was deregistered on 25 June 2013 by the Electoral Commission, as the party no longer had the required minimum of 500 members. The party was subsequently re-registered.\n\nIn Niue, there have been no political parties since 2003, when the Niue People's Party disbanded, and all politicians are \"de facto\" independents. The government depends on an informal coalition.\n\nPakistan is a Democratic country and also has Independent politician standing in elections. Pakistan's Parliament has General Elections, 2008 Elected 30 Members. In Election 2011 has won the 4 candidates in National Assembly.In General Election 2013, 9 seats won by independents.\n\nNoli de Castro, the Philippines' former vice president, ran as senator in 2001 with no political party affiliation. He was a guest candidate of the opposition Pwersa ng Masa coalition but he never joined their campaign rallies. He won in the senate race with the highest votes (then) in Philippine history. In 2004, he ran as vice president as a guest candidate of the administration K-4 coalition and won with just under majority of the vote.\n\nStarting in 2001, several senators had also resigned from their respective parties to become independents; at the start of the 15th Congress, there were more independent senators than any other single political party. However, in contesting elections, all elected independents had been members of either the administration or the opposition coalition, until in the 2007 Senate election when Gregorio Honasan (a former senator) was elected as an independent while not a being member of any coalition. Honasan was earlier elected in 1995 as an independent candidate and being adopted by the Nationalist People's Coalition-led coalition to become the first elected independent senator since Magnolia Antonino in 1967, although Antonino was a guest candidate of the Liberal Party then.\n\nIn the local level, former priest Eddie Panlilio was elected as governor of Pampanga in 2007, defeating two administration candidates. When Panlilio eventually transferred to the Liberal Party in time for the 2010 election, it was ruled that he was beaten in the 2007 election; in 2010, he was defeated.\n\nIn the 2010 House of Representatives elections, seven independents were elected, although all but two joined a political party after the elections.\n\nIn contesting elections, independent candidates are required by law to spend less than candidates nominated by a party.\n\nThe Polish Sejm is elected by party-list ordination, which does not allow lone candidates to run, although since 2001 there has been a possibility to create non-partisan \"Voters' Electoral Committee\" (pol. \"KWW\", \"komitet wyborczy wyborców\"); they are by almost any means party lists, but no officially registered party is behind them. They can be unregistered parties, e.g. Kukiz'15, or non-partisan movements, although the latter never reached the 5% threshold. National minorities candidates also form Voters' Electoral Committees (like German Minority Electoral Committee, represented in Sejm since 1991), but they do not have to reach the nationwide threshold. However, during a Sejm term many members switch parties or become independents.\n\nTickets like Civic Platform during the 2001 election were formally non-partisan, Civic Platform was widely viewed as a de facto political party, as it is now.\n\nThe situation in the Senate is different, as the voting system allows independents to run as single candidates and some are elected in their own right. In the last parliamentary election (2015) four independents won seats in the Senate.\n\nThree Presidents since 1990 have technically been independents. Lech Wałęsa was not an endorsed candidate of any party, but the chairman of the Solidarity and he was elected without full support of this union (Solidarity votes split between him and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki). Aleksander Kwaśniewski was a leader of the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland, but formally resigned from the party after he was elected, as did Lech Kaczyński, who was the first leader of Law and Justice, Bronisław Komorowski (PO) and Andrzej Duda (PiS). The resignation is required because the Constitution says that the president shall hold no other offices nor discharge any public functions. The aforementioned presidents often participated in their party's campaigns (e.g. Andrzej Duda in the Law and Justice campaign three months after his resignation from the party).\n\nMarcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the current President of Portugal since 6 March 2016, was elected on 24 January 2016 as an independent.\n\nAll of Russia's Presidents have been independents. Former president Dmitry Medvedev declined an offer to join United Russia, saying that he believes the President should be an independent so that he serves the interests of the country rather than his political party.\n\nVladimir Putin, the current president of Russia, was the head of the United Russia party until 26 May 2012, but even then was not its member, thus formally was and still is independent.\n\nAfter Taiwanese local elections, 2018, there is only one independent local head:\n\nThe Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 laid down the first specific rules in the United Kingdom relating to the use of the term 'independent' by election candidates. That Act was repealed with most of its contents covered by Part II of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Candidates standing for United Kingdom local elections and United Kingdom parliamentary elections, including the devolved assemblies, can use the name of a registered political party, or the term 'Independent' (or its Welsh language equivalent \"annibynol\") or no ballot paper description at all (this latter choice was used, for example, by David Icke at the Haltemprice and Howden by-election, 2008).\n\nSome groups in the United Kingdom who are not affiliated to any national or regional party have registered locality-based political parties. Some English examples are the Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern, the Epsom and Ewell Residents Association, the Devizes Guardians, the Derwentside Independents, and the East Yorkshire Independents.\n\nBefore the twentieth century it was fairly common for independents to be elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, but there have been very few since 1945.\n\nS. O. Davies, the veteran Labour MP held his Merthyr Tydfil seat in the General Election of 1970, standing as an independent, after he had been deselected by the Labour Party.\n\nThe journalist Martin Bell was elected at Tatton in the General Election of 1997, having stood on an anti-corruption platform. He was the first independent to be newly elected to the Commons since 1951. He stood unsuccessfully in a different constituency in 2001.\n\nAt the 2001 General Election, Dr Richard Taylor of the Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern party was elected for the constituency of Wyre Forest.\n\nTwo independent (or local party) members of parliament were elected in the 2005 election, although both were defeated five years later.\n\nAt the same General Election, Peter Law was elected as an independent at Blaenau Gwent. Law died on 25 April 2006: the resulting by-election elected Dai Davies of the local party Blaenau Gwent People's Voice. The by-election was unusual as it was the first time in over eighty years that an independent had held a seat previously occupied by another independent.\n\nAlso at the 2005 General Election Richard Taylor was re-elected for Wyre Forest. This was notable for the fact that he was the only independent in recent times to have been elected for a second term.\n\nOnly one independent was elected to the Commons in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 elections, Sylvia Hermon, the Member for North Down, a Unionist who left the Ulster Unionist Party because of its links with the Conservatives.\n\nThere have also been several instances of politicians being elected to the Commons as representatives of a political party, then resigning the party's whip, or having it withdrawn. Examples in this in the 2010-2015 parliament included Mike Hancock (formerly a Liberal Democrat), Eric Joyce (formerly Labour) and Nadine Dorries, a Conservative who had the whip withdrawn for part of the parliament and thus sat as an independent during that time.\n\nIndependent candidates often stand in British parliamentary elections, often with platforms about specific local issues, but usually without success. An example from the 2001 general election was Aston Villa supporter Ian Robinson, who stood as an independent in the Sutton Coldfield constituency in protest at the way chairman Doug Ellis ran the football club. Another example an independent candidate, in the Salisbury constituency, is Arthur Uther Pendragon, a local activist and self-declared reincarnation of King Arthur.\n\nOther independent candidates are associated with a political party and may be former members of it, but cannot stand under its label. For instance, after being expelled from the Labour Party but before the Respect Coalition was founded, British Member of Parliament (MP) George Galloway described himself as \"Independent Labour\".\n\nOn 23 March 2005 the Independent Network was set up to support independent candidates in the General Election. The Independent Network still supports Independent candidates in local, regional, national and European elections. It has an organic set of principles which are known as the Bell Principles and are very closely related to Lord Nolan's Standards of Public Life. The Independent Network does not impose any ideology or political influence on their candidates.\n\nIn March 2009, the multi-millionaire Paul Judge established the Jury Team, an umbrella organisation dedicated to increasing the number of independent candidates standing in Britain, in both national and European elections.\n\nPart II of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 allows individuals who wish to stand as a candidate to all parliaments and assemblies in the UK, including the House of Commons, the right to use one of three ballot paper descriptions. Those descriptions are the name of a registered political party; the word \"independent\" or the Welsh equivalent; or no description at all, leaving the ballot paper description box blank.\n\nUnless a candidate stands as \"independent\" or as a \"No Description\" candidate leaving the ballot paper description box blank, their candidature must be confirmed by a signed certificate from the relevant officer from a registered political party, as set out in Section 52 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006.\n\nThe House of Lords includes a large number of peers independent from political parties. Some are simply not affiliated with any grouping, whilst another, larger, grouping is given the official designation of crossbenchers. Additionally the Lords Spiritual (bishops of the Church of England) do not have party affiliations.\n\nIn the 2003 Scottish Parliamentary elections, three MSPs were elected as Independents: Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West), Dr Jean Turner (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) and Margo MacDonald (Lothians). In 2004 Campbell Martin (West of Scotland region) left the Scottish National Party to become an independent and in 2005 Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) left the Conservative Party to become an independent. At the 2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections Margo MacDonald was again returned as an independent MSP and was elected as an independent for the third time four years later. She died in 2014 while still serving as member of the Parliament. As she was elected as an independent regional MSP, there could be no by-election and her seat remained vacant until the 2016 election.\n\nPeter Law was expelled from the Labour Party after standing against an official Labour candidate in Blaenau Gwent at the 2005 UK general election and became an independent in the National Assembly and UK Parliament. In 2006 Peter Law died from a brain tumour and his wife, Trish Law campaigned and took the seat as an independent candidate at the sequent by-election and held onto the seat again in the 2007 Welsh Assembly elections.\n\nIn 2016, Nathan Gill as the then leader of UKIP Wales defected from the group to sit as an independent after a falling out with Neil Hamiliton who was elected UKIP Assembly group leader. Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas left the Plaid Cymru group later in 2016 after multiple fallings out with Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood. Dafydd Elis-Thomas said his reason for leaving Plaid Cymru was that it not serious about working with the Welsh Labour Government. Neil McEvoy Was expelled from Plaid Cymru on 16 January 2018 and is now sitting as an independent AM. Nathan Gill stood down on the 27 December 2017 and was replaced by Mandy Jones. Mandy Jones left the UKIP group on the 9 January 2018 over a fallout over her staff.\n\nThe introduction of directly elected mayors in several parts of England has witnessed the election of independents to run councils in Stoke-on-Trent, Middlesbrough, Bedford, Hartlepool and Mansfield. The first Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, was first elected as an independent, having run against the official Labour candidate Frank Dobson. He was subsequently re-admitted to the Labour Party in December 2003 before his first re-election campaign.\n\nIndependent candidates frequently stand and are elected to local councils. There is a special Independent group of the Local Government Association to cater for them. A number of local authorities have been entirely or almost entirely composed of independent members, such as the City of London Corporation, the Isles of Scilly Council, Orkney Islands Council, Shetland Islands Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) in the Outer Hebrides.\n\nRoughly a quarter of the police and crime commissioners elected in England and Wales in the 2012 election were independents.\n\nGeorge Washington was the only president elected as an independent, as he was not formally affiliated with any party during his term in office.\n\nJohn Tyler was expelled from the Whig Party in September 1841, and remained effectively an independent for the remainder of his presidency, later returning to the Democrats. He briefly sought re-election in 1844 as a National Democrat, but withdrew over fear he would split the Democratic vote.\n\nSince 1900, notable candidates running as independents for U.S. president have included Republican Congressman John Anderson in 1980, Ross Perot in 1992, and former Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 1996 and 2000 elections. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders ran for the Democratic nomination, but ultimately did not appear on the ballot in the 2016 election, though he did receive 5% of the vote as a write-in candidate in his home state of Vermont.\n\nIn 2008, Nader formed Independent Parties in New Mexico, Delaware, and elsewhere to gain ballot access in several states. This strategy has been pursued by several other candidates for Federal races, including Joe Lieberman (Connecticut for Lieberman).\n\nIllinois, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Alaska and Minnesota have elected formally independent candidates as governor: Illinois's first two governors, Shadrach Bond and Edward Coles; James B. Longley in 1974 as well as Angus King in 1994 and 1998 from Maine; Lincoln Chafee in 2010 from Rhode Island; Julius Meier in 1930 from Oregon; Sam Houston in 1859 from Texas; and Bill Walker in 2014 from Alaska. Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. is sometimes mentioned as an independent governor, though this is not technically correct; he ran as an A Connecticut Party candidate (which gave him better ballot placement than an unaffiliated candidate would receive), defeating the Democratic and Republican party nominees. Another former governor who is sometimes mentioned as an independent is Jesse Ventura, who actually ran as a member of the Reform Party's Minnesota affiliate, which later disaffiliated from the party and reverted to their original name the Independence Party of Minnesota.\n\nIn 1971, State Senator Henry Howell of Virginia, a former Democrat, was elected lieutenant governor as an independent. Two years later, he campaigned for governor as an independent, but lost by 15,000 votes.\n\nThere were several unsuccessful independent gubernatorial candidates in 2006 who impacted their electoral races. In Maine, state legislator Barbara Merrill (formerly a Democrat) received 21% of the vote. In Texas, country music singer and mystery novelist Kinky Friedman received 12.43% of the vote, and State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn received 18.13%. Strayhorn and Friedman's presence in the race resulted in a splitting of the ballot four ways between themselves and the two major parties.\n\nIn 2010, Florida governor Charlie Crist left the Republican party and became Independent (He later became a Democrat.) rather than face former state house Speaker Marco Rubio in the Republican primary (Rubio won, though Crist came in ahead of Democratic nominee Kendrick Meek).\n\nIn 2014, former Honolulu mayor Mufi Hannemann ran as an independent candidate for the governorship of the State of Hawaii after previously campaigning in the state's Democratic primary. As a result, Democratic candidate David Ige was elected as governor with a plurality of 49%.\n\nThere have been several independents elected to the United States Senate throughout history. Notable examples include David Davis of Illinois (a former Republican) in the 19th century, and Harry F. Byrd, Jr. of Virginia (who had been elected to his first term as a Democrat) in the 20th century. Some officials have been elected as members of a party but became independent while in office (without being elected as such), such as Wayne Morse of Oregon. Nebraska senator George W. Norris was elected for four terms as a Republican before changing to an independent after the Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 1930. Norris won re-election as an independent in 1936, but later lost his final re-election attempt to Republican Kenneth S. Wherry in 1942. Vermont senator Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party to become an independent in 2001. Jeffords's change of party status was especially significant because it shifted the Senate composition from 50-50 between the Republicans and Democrats (with a Republican Vice President, Dick Cheney, who would presumably break all ties in favor of the Republicans), to 49 Republicans, 50 Democrats, and one Independent. Jeffords agreed to vote for Democratic control of the Senate in exchange for being appointed chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and the Democrats held control of the Senate until the Congressional elections in 2002, when the Republicans regained their majority. Jeffords retired at the end of his term in 2007. Wayne Morse after two years as an independent became a Democrat. Dean Barkley of the Independence Party of Minnesota was appointed a day before the 2002 elections to fill the senate seat of Paul Wellstone who, while running for re-election, died weeks prior. Barkley refused to caucus with either party.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders is the longest serving independent member of Congress in American history. He was an independent member of the United States House of Representatives for Vermont-at-large from 1991 to 2007. Sanders later won the open Senate seat of Jim Jeffords as an independent. Joe Lieberman is a former Democrat who, like Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., ran under a third party (Connecticut for Lieberman Party) in the 2006 election. Though both representatives are technically independent politicians, they often caucus with the Democrats. In 2006, Sanders and Lieberman were the only two victorious independent candidates for Congress. In 2012 Angus King was elected to the US Senate as an Independent from Maine. , he has typically caucused with the Democrats.\n\nThe United States House of Representatives has also seen a handful of independent members. Examples include Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Virgil Goode of Virginia, Frazier Reams of Ohio, and Victor Berger of Wisconsin.\n\nIn August 2008, there were 12 independents who held offices in state legislatures. There were four state senators, one from Kentucky, one from Oregon, one from Tennessee, and one from New Mexico. The representatives came from the states of Louisiana (two), Maine (two), Vermont (two), and Virginia (two). In the 2008 general elections, Wisconsin State Assemblyman Jeffrey Wood left the Republican Party and won reelection as an independent. After the 2008 primary election, New Mexico State Senator Joseph Carraro left the Republican Party and registered as an Independent. He did not run for reelection.\n\nIn November 2005, Manny Diaz was elected Mayor of Miami, Florida as an independent. On June 19, 2007, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent. Oscar Goodman, Mayor of Las Vegas, Nevada switched his affiliation to Independent from Democrat in December 2009. Dan Hollingsworth has won four consecutive elections as an Independent since 1998 for mayor of the small city of Ruston, Louisiana, the home of Louisiana Tech University.\n\nThe Nebraska Legislature is unique in that it is the only nonpartisan state legislature. In the Legislature (which is additionally unique in that it is also the only state legislature that is unicameral), there are no formal party alignments or groups and the members are nominated in nonpartisan primary elections. Members are allowed to register with political parties but choose not to reveal their affiliation while seated, as a professional courtesy. However, the political affiliation of party-affiliated members are considered open secrets and the parties exist in the legislature on an unofficial basis. Some members, such as Ernie Chambers of Omaha, are independent of party officially, while others have not publicly disclosed their affiliation.\n\nNotes:\nReferences:\n\n"}

{"id": "853189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=853189", "title": "Left-hand path and right-hand path", "text": "Left-hand path and right-hand path\n\nIn Western esotericism the Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path are the dichotomy between two opposing approaches to magic. This terminology is used in various groups involved in the occult and ceremonial magic. In some definitions, the \"Left-Hand Path\" is equated with malicious black magic and the \"Right-Hand Path\" with benevolent white magic. Other occultists have criticised this definition, believing that the Left–Right dichotomy refers merely to different kinds of working and does not necessarily connote good or bad magical actions.\n\nIn more recent definitions, which base themselves on the terms' origins in Indian Tantra, the Right-Hand Path, or RHP, is seen as a definition for those magical groups that follow specific ethical codes and adopt social convention, while the Left-Hand Path adopts the opposite attitude, espousing the breaking of taboo and the abandoning of set morality. Some contemporary occultists, such as Peter J. Carroll, have stressed that both paths can be followed by a magical practitioner, as essentially they have the same goals.\n\nThe Right-Hand Path is commonly thought to refer to magical or religious groups which adhere to a certain set of characteristics:\n\nThe occultists Dion Fortune and William G. Gray consider non-magical Abrahamic religions to be RHP.\n\nThe historian Dave Evans studied self-professed followers of the Left-Hand Path in the early 21st century, making several observations about their practices:\n\nCriticism of both terms has come from various occultists. The Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, Andrew D. Chumbley, stated that they were simply \"theoretical constructs\" that were \"without definitive objectivity\", and that nonetheless, both forms could be employed by the magician. He used the analogy of a person having two hands, a right and a left, both of which served the same master. Similar sentiments were expressed by the Wiccan High Priest John Belham-Payne, who stated that \"For me, magic is magic.\"\n\n\"Vāmācāra\" is a Sanskrit term meaning \"left-handed attainment\" and is synonymous with Left-Hand Path or Left-path (Sanskrit: \"Vāmamārga\"). It is used to describe a particular mode of worship or spiritual practice (Sanskrit: \"sadhana\") that is not only heterodox (Sanskrit: \"Nāstika\") to standard Vedic injunction, but extreme in comparison to prevailing cultural norms. These practices are often generally considered to be Tantric in orientation. The converse term to \"Vāmācāra\" is \"Dakshinachara\" (glossed \"Right-Hand Path\") which is used to refer not only to orthodox (\"Āstika\") sects but to modes of spirituality that engage in spiritual practices that not only accord with Vedic injunction but are generally agreeable to prevailing cultural norms. That said, left-handed and right-handed modes of practice may be evident in both orthodox and heterodox schools of Dharmic religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism and are a matter of taste, culture, proclivity, initiation, \"sadhana\" and dharmic lineage (\"parampara\").\n\nThe occidental use of the terms \"Left-Hand Path\" and \"Right Hand-Path\" originated with Madame Blavatsky, a 19th-century occultist who founded the Theosophical Society. She had travelled across parts of southern Asia and claimed to have met with many mystics and magical practitioners in India and Tibet. She developed the term \"Left-Hand Path\" as a translation of the term Vamachara, an Indian Tantric practice that emphasised the breaking of Hindu societal taboos by having sexual intercourse in ritual, drinking alcohol, eating meat and assembling in graveyards, as a part of the spiritual practice. The term \"Vamachara\" literally meant \"the left-hand way\" in Sanskrit, and it was from this that Blavatsky first coined the term.\n\nReturning to Europe, Blavatsky began using the term. It was relatively easy for her to associate \"left\" with evil in many European countries, where it already had an association with many negative things; as the historian Dave Evans noted, homosexuals were referred to as \"left-handed\", and while in Protestant nations Roman Catholics were called \"left-footers\".\n\nIn New York, Madame Blavatsky founded the Theosophical Society with several other people in 1875. She set about writing several books, including \"Isis Unveiled\" (1877) in which she introduced the terms \"Left-Hand Path\" and \"Right-Hand Path\", firmly stating that she herself followed the RHP, and that followers of the LHP were practitioners of Black Magic who were a threat to society. The occult community soon picked up on her newly introduced duality, which, according to historian Dave Evans, \"had not been known before\" in the Western Esoteric Tradition. For instance, Dion Fortune, the founder of an esoteric magical group (the Society of the Inner Light) also took the side of the RHP, making the claim that \"black magicians\", or followers of the LHP, were homosexuals and that Indian servants might use malicious magical rites devoted to the goddess Kali against their European masters.\n\nAleister Crowley further altered and popularized the term in certain occult circles, referring to a \"Brother of the Left-Hand Path\", or a \"Black Brother\", as one who failed to attain the grade of Magister Templi in Crowley's system of ceremonial magic. Crowley also referred to the Left-Hand Path when describing the point at which the Adeptus Exemptus (such as his old Christian mentor, Macgregor Mathers) chooses to cross the Abyss, which is the location of Choronzon and the illusory eleventh Sephira, which is Da'ath or Knowledge. In this example, the adept must surrender all, including the guidance of his Holy Guardian Angel, and leap into the Abyss. If his accumulated Karma is sufficient, and if he has been utterly thorough in his own self-destruction, he becomes a \"babe of the abyss\", arising as a Star in the Crowleyan system. On the other hand, if he retains some fragment of ego, or if he fears to cross, he then becomes encysted. The layers of his self, which he could have shed in the Abyss, ossify around him. He is then titled a \"Brother of the Left-Hand Path\", who will eventually be broken up and disintegrated against his will, since he failed to choose voluntary disintegration. Crowley associated all this with \"Mary, a blasphemy against BABALON\", and with the celibacy of Christian clergy.\n\nAnother of those figures that Fortune considered to be a follower of the LHP was Arthur Edward Waite, who did not recognise these terms, and acknowledged that they were newly introduced and that in any case he believed the terms LHP and RHP to be distinct from black and white magic. However, despite Waite's attempts to distinguish the two, the equation of the LHP with Black Magic was propagated more widely in the fiction of Dennis Wheatley; Wheatley also conflated the two with Satanism and also the political ideology of communism, which he viewed as a threat to traditional British society. In one of his novels, \"Strange Conflict\" (1941), he stated that:\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century various groups arose that self-professedly described themselves as LHP, but did not consider themselves as following Black Magic. In 1975, Kenneth Grant, a student of Aleister Crowley, explained in \"Cults of the Shadow\" that he and his group, the Typhonian Order, practiced the LHP. Grant's usage takes meaning from its roots in eastern Tantra; Grant states that it is about challenging taboos, but that it should be used in conjunction with the RHP to achieve balance.\n\nWhen Anton Szandor LaVey was developing his form of LaVeyan Satanism during the 1960s, he emphasised the rejection of traditional Christian morality and as such labelled his new philosophy to be a form of the Left-Hand Path. In his \"The Satanic Bible\", he wrote that \"Satanism is not a white light religion; it is a religion of the flesh, the mundane, the carnal—all of which are ruled by Satan, the personification of the Left Hand Path.\"\n\nIn Russia there is a tradition of Left Hand Path practices within the Rodnover community under the influence of Volhv Veleslav, and within the Odinist community with Askr Svarte, and in England with Nikarev Leshy. Veleslav has also written numerous books on Tantra and the Left Hand Path.\n\nStephen E. Flowers, Ph.D. of the Temple of Set states in his book \"Lords of the Left Hand Path: A History of Spiritual Dissent\" there are two criteria to be considered a true Lord of the Left Hand Path and they are Self-Deification and Antinomianism.\n\nTantra is a set of esoteric Indian traditions with roots in Hinduism and Buddhism. Tantra is often divided by its practitioners into two different paths: \"dakshinachara\" and \"vamachara\", translated as \"Right-Hand Path\" and \"Left-Hand Path\" respectively. Dakshinachara consists of traditional Hindu practices such as asceticism and meditation, while vamachara also includes ritual practices that conflict with mainstream Hinduism, such as sexual rituals, consumption of alcohol and other intoxicants. The two paths are viewed by Tantrists as equally valid approaches to enlightenment. Vamachara, however, is often considered to be the faster and more dangerous of the two paths, and is not suitable for all practitioners. The usage of the terms Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path is still current in modern Indian and Buddhist Tantra.\n\nRobert Beér's \"Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs\" clarifies widespread taboos and deprecation that associate the left hand as dark, female, inferior and 'not right':\n\n\"In Buddhist tantra, the right hand symbolises the male aspect of compassion or skilful means, and the left hand represents the female aspect of wisdom or emptiness. Ritual hand-held attributes, such as the vajra and bell, vajra and lotus, damaru and bell, damaru and khatvanga, arrow and bow, curved knife and skull-cup, sword and shield, hook and rope snare, etc., placed in the right and left hands respectively, symbolise the union of the active male aspect of skilful means with the contemplative female aspect of wisdom.\n\nIn both Hinduism and Buddhism the goddess is always placed on the left side of the male deity, where she 'sits on his left thigh, while her lord places his left arm over her left shoulder and dallies with her left breast'.\n\nIn representations of the Buddha image, the right hand often makes an active mudra of skilful means—the earth-touching, protection, fearlessness, wish-granting or teaching mudra; while the left hand often remains in the passive mudra of meditative equipoise, resting in the lap and symbolising meditation on emptiness or wisdom.\"\n\nBeér's preceding explanations correspond to Yab-Yum (father-mother) symbolism and contemplation on or practice of sexual rituals associated with Vajrayogini and Anuttarayoga Tantra. Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion. The metaphorical union of bliss and emptiness is commonly represented within Thangka paintings of the Cakrasaṃvara Tantra depicting the sexual union of the deity Saṃvara and his consort Dorje Pakmo.\n\n\n\n"}

Chandrasekharan\n\nMalappurath Raman Chandrasekharan (; born 26 Feb 1929), popularly known as M.R. Chandrasekharan () or simply M. R. C. (), is a Malayalam literary critic and author from Kerala, India. Chandrasekharan has published more than 40 books in different literary sections like literary criticism, translations, politics, social etc. He is also noted for his work in the field of journalism and education. He won the 2010 Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Literary Criticism.\n\nChandrasekharan was born to Malappurath Raman Vaidyar and K. S. Devaki on 26 Feb 1929 at Pottore, Thrissur (Trichur) in Kerala. His childhood days were spent in the village where he attended the Tirur Lower Secondary School and Vivekodayam High School, Thrissur. He took his Bachelor's degree from Sree Kerala Varma College, Thrissur, BOL from University of Madras and later the master's degree from Kerala University in Malayalam language and literature.\n\nChandrasekharan started his career as a journalist in Navajeevan edited by Joseph Mundassery for the CPI. Subsequently, he joined as a sub-editor in Mathrubhumi daily in Kozhikode, but was sent out for his communist leaning.\n\nHe worked as a school teacher at Kodakara National High School and Bekal Govt.

{"id": "53210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53210", "title": "Marion Zimmer Bradley", "text": "Marion Zimmer Bradley\n\nMarion Eleanor Zimmer Bradley (June 3, 1930 – September 25, 1999) was an American author of fantasy, historical fantasy, science fiction, and science fantasy novels, and is best known for the Arthurian fiction novel \"The Mists of Avalon\", and the Darkover series. While she is noted for her feminist perspective in her writing, her popularity has been posthumously marred by multiple accusations against her of child sexual abuse and rape by two of her children, Mark and Moira Greyland, and others. \n\nBorn Marion Eleanor Zimmer on June 3, 1930, she lived on a farm in Albany, New York, and began writing at the age of 17. She was married to Robert Alden Bradley from October 26, 1949 until their divorce on May 19, 1964. They had a son, David Robert Bradley (1950–2008). During the 1950s she was introduced to lesbian advocacy organization the Daughters of Bilitis.\n\nAfter her divorce, Bradley married numismatist Walter H. Breen on June 3, 1964. They had a daughter, Moira Greyland, who is a professional harpist and singer, and a son, Mark Greyland.\n\nIn 1965, Bradley graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas. Afterward, she moved to Berkeley, California, to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley between 1965 and 1967. In 1966, she helped found and named the Society for Creative Anachronism and was involved in developing several local groups, some in New York after her move to Staten Island.\n\nBradley and Breen separated in 1979 but remained married, and continued a business relationship and lived on the same street for over a decade. They officially divorced on May 9, 1990, the year Breen was arrested on child molestation charges after a 13-year-old boy reported that Breen had been molesting him for four years. She had edited Breen's book \"Greek Love\", which was dedicated to her, and in 1965 had contributed an article, \"Feminine Equivalents of Greek Love in Modern Literature\", to Breen's journal \"The International Journal of Greek Love\". She had known about Breen's sexual interests and previously accepted his sexual abuse of a 14-year-old boy.\n\nWhile she was attending the College for Teachers (now University at Albany, SUNY) in Albany, Bradley became involved in Western esoteric tradition. She later completed the Rosicrucian correspondence course.\n\nIn the late 1950s or early 1960s, Bradley and Walter H. Breen founded the Aquarian Order of the Restoration based on the work of Dion Fortune. By 1961 she was formally initiating others, including Ramfis S. Firethorn.\n\nBradley was active in Darkmoon Circle, which was founded in 1978 by several women who were members of her Aquarian Order of the Restoration. Bradley renovated her garage to provide a meeting room for Darkmoon Circle as well as for other local Pagan groups. In 1981 Bradley, Diana L. Paxson, and Elisabeth Waters incorporated the Center for Non-Traditional Religion.\n\nIn the 1990s Bradley said she would return to Christianity, telling an interviewer: \"I just go regularly to the Episcopalian church... That pagan thing... I feel that I've gotten past it. I would like people to explore the possibilities.\"\n\nAfter suffering declining health for years, Bradley died at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a debilitating heart attack. Her ashes were later scattered at Glastonbury Tor in Somerset, England.\n\nIn 2014, her daughter, Moira Greyland, accused her of sexual abuse from the age of three to 12. In an email to \"The Guardian,\" Greyland said that she had not spoken out before because: Greyland also claimed that she was not the only victim and that she was one of the people who reported her father, Walter H. Breen, for child molestation, for which he received multiple convictions. By her own admission, Bradley was aware of her husband's behavior although she chose not to report him.\n\nIn response to these allegations, on July 2, 2014, Victor Gollancz Ltd, the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, announced that it will donate all income from the sales of Bradley's e-books to the charity Save the Children. The author Janni Lee Simner, who has continued to write works in Bradley's Darkover series, announced on June 13, 2014 that she would be donating advances from her two Darkover books, her Darkover royalties and at the request of her husband, Larry Hammer, payment for his sale to Bradley’s magazine, to the American anti-sexual assault organization Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.\n\nSince the allegations were made public, Greyland and her brother Mark have spoken at length about their experiences and a number of famous science fiction authors have publicly condemned Bradley. Among the first was John Scalzi, who within a day of the allegations being made public, described the allegations as \"horrific\". Hugo Award winner Jim C. Hines wrote that Bradley's positive effect on her readers and associates \"makes the revelations about Marion Zimmer Bradley protecting a known child rapist and molesting her own daughter and others even more tragic.\" G Willow Wilson, World Fantasy award winner, said she was \"speechless\". Diana L. Paxson, who collaborated with Bradley on a number of novels and who continued to write novels set in the Avalon Series after Bradley's death, said that she was \"shocked and appalled to read Moira Greyland’s posts about her mother.\" \n\nBradley stated that when she was a child she enjoyed reading adventure fantasy authors such as Henry Kuttner, Edmond Hamilton, C.L. Moore, and Leigh Brackett, especially when they wrote about \"the glint of strange suns on worlds that never were and never would be\". Her first novel and much of her subsequent work show their influence strongly. At 17, she began her first novel \"The Forest House\", her retelling of \"Norma\"; she finished it before her death.\n\nBradley made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in \"Amazing Stories\" in 1949 with the short story \"Outpost\". \"Outpost\" was published in \"Amazing Stories\" Vol. 23, No. 12, the December 1949 issue; it had previously appeared in the fanzine \"Spacewarp\" Vol. 4, No. 3, in December 1948. Her first professional publication was a short story \"Women Only\", which appeared in the second (and final) issue of \"Vortex Science Fiction\" in 1953. Her first published novel-length work was \"Falcons of Narabedla\", first published in the May 1957 issue of \"Other Worlds\".\n\nEarly in her career, writing as Morgan Ives, Miriam Gardner, John Dexter, and Lee Chapman, Bradley produced several works outside the speculative fiction genre, including gay and lesbian pulp fiction novels; \"I Am a Lesbian\" was published in 1962. Though relatively tame by today's standards, her novels were considered pornographic when published, and for a long time she refused to disclose the titles she wrote under these pseudonyms.\n\nHer 1958 novel \"The Planet Savers\" introduced the planet of Darkover, which became the setting of a popular series by Bradley and other authors. The Darkover milieu is a science fantasy fictional world, with science fiction as well as fantasy overtones: Darkover is a lost human colony where psi powers developed to an unusual degree, and work like magic, while technology has regressed to a more-or-less medieval stage. Bradley wrote many Darkover novels by herself, but in her later years collaborated with other authors for publication; her literary collaborators have continued the series since her death.\nBradley took an active role in science fiction and fantasy fandom, promoting interaction with professional authors and publishers and making several important contributions to the subculture. In her teens she wrote letters to the pulp magazines of the time, such as the above-mentioned \"Amazing Stories\" and \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\". Starting in the late 1940s and continuing in the 1950s and 1960s, she published her own fanzines, including \"Astra's Tower\", \"Day*Star\", and \"Anything Box\". She also co-edited fanzines, including \"Ugly Bird\" with Redd Boggs, \"MEZRAB\" with her first husband Robert Bradley, and \"Allerlei\" with her second husband Walter Breen. Bradley contributed to several other fanzines, including \"The Gorgon\" and \"The Nekromantikon\". In the 1970s, as part of the contemporary wave of enthusiasm for J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth, she wrote two short fanfic stories about Arwen and published them in chapbook format. One story, \"The Jewel of Arwen\" (originally published in a different form in the fanzine \"I Palantir\" #2, August 1961), appeared in her professional anthology \"The Best of Marion Zimmer Bradley\" (1985), but was dropped from later reprints. She continued to contribute to different science fiction and fantasy fanzines and magazines throughout her career.\n\nIn 1966, Bradley became a co-founder of the Society for Creative Anachronism and is credited with coining the name of that group.\n\nFor many years, Bradley actively encouraged Darkover fan fiction. She encouraged submissions from unpublished authors and reprinted some of it in commercial Darkover anthologies. This ended after a dispute with a fan over an unpublished Darkover novel of Bradley's that had similarities to one of the fan's stories. As a result, the novel remained unpublished and Bradley demanded the cessation of all Darkover fan fiction.\n\nBradley was the editor of the long-running \"Sword and Sorceress\" anthology series, which encouraged submissions of fantasy stories featuring original and non-traditional heroines from young and upcoming authors. Although she particularly encouraged young female authors, she was not averse to including stories from men in her anthologies. Mercedes Lackey was one of many authors who first appeared in the anthologies. Bradley also maintained a large family of writers at her home in Berkeley, California. Bradley was editing the final \"Sword and Sorceress\" manuscript until the week of her death.\n\nHer most famous single novel may be \"The Mists of Avalon\", a retelling of the Camelot legend from the point of view of Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar. It grew into a series of books and, like the Darkover series, the later novels are written with or by other authors and have continued to appear since Bradley's death.\n\nIn 1962, the critic Damon Knight stated that \"(h)er work is distinctively feminine in tone, but lacks the clichés, overemphasis and other kittenish tricks which often make female fiction unreadable by males\".\n\nBradley was posthumously awarded the World Fantasy Award for lifetime achievement in 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBradley created several different fanzines, including \"The Anything Box\" (2 issues, 1959), \"Astra's Tower\" (5 issues, 1947–50), \"Astra's Tower, Special Leaflet\" (5 issues, 1952–62), \"Day*Star\" (28 issues, 1954–72), \"Fantasy Ambler\" (1 issue, 1962), \"Gemini, Jr.\" (1 issue, 1951), \"Gemini FAPA\" (3 issues, 1951–60), \"On the Ragged Edge\" (1 issue, undated), and \"Catch Trap\" (at least issues 89–106, early 1960s). She co-edited several other fanzines, including \"Allerlei\" (at least 17 issues, 1960–65, with Walter Breen), \"Anduril\" (1 issue, 1962, with David Bradley and Paul Zimmer), \"MEZRAB\" (7 issues, 1950–52, with Robert A. Bradley), and \"Ugly Bird\" (2 issues, 1956–59, with Redd Boggs).\n\nShe also contributed to \"The Ladder\" and \"The Mattachine Review\". As Elfrieda or Elfrida Rivers, she contributed at least to the underground newspaper \"The East Village Other\", the neo-Pagan periodical \"Green Egg\" and also \"Sybil Leek's Astrology Journal\", where she wrote horoscopes and book reviews and had her own column as well as occasionally worked as editors with her husband Walter Breen.\n\n"}

They include the Trique (or Triqui) languages, spoken by about 24,500 people; Cuicatec, spoken by about 15,000 people; and the large expanse of Mixtec languages, spoken by about 511,000 people. The relationship between Trique, Cuicatec, and Mixtec, is an open question. Unpublished research by Terrence Kaufman in the 1980s supported grouping Cuicatec and Mixtec together.\n\nThe \"urheimat\" of the Otomanguean family may be the valley of Tehuacán (Puebla). This site was one of the places of the domestication of maize. The thousand-year presence of Otomanguean-speaking groups in this region makes it probable that they were active in this domestication process, which favored the inhabitants of the Altiplano's transition to a sedentary lifestyle and thus influenced the development of Mesoamerican civilization. Campbell and Kaufman have proposed that the Otomanguean languages began to diverge about 1500 BCE. The difficulty of establishing more general relationships between the eight subgroups of the family presents a difficulty for making more detailed inferences on the historical development of the languages.\n\nProto Otomanguean has been reconstructed by Robert E. Longacre and Calvin Rensch. The phonological system of the protolanguage has nine consonants, four vowels, and four tones. The groups of consonants and the diphthongs formed from this limited repertory would have been the origin of the phonemes in the daughter protolanguages of the various subgroups of Proto-Otomanguean. Some of the most significant changes in the diversification of Proto-Otomanguean phonemes into Proto-Mixtecan phonemes are the following:\n\nRensch revised the reconstruction work of Longacre. He revised the probable phonological inventory and described some of his proposals, based on comparisons of the cognates in the Mixtecan languages. After this work, he proposed a reconstruction of the phonological system of Proto-Mixtecan. This proposal contains sixteen consonants, four vowels, and four tones.\n\nLongacre (1957) had reconstructed the following consonant inventory for proto-Mixtecan:\n\n\n"}

It is calculated by subtracting non-revenue-earning spaces i.e. spaces not available for carrying cargo, for example engine rooms, fuel tanks and crew quarters, from the ship's gross register tonnage. Net tonnage is thus used in situations where a vessel's earning capacity is important, rather than its mere size. Net register tonnage is not a measure of the weight of the ship or its cargo, and should not be confused with terms such as deadweight tonnage or displacement.\n\nGross and net register tonnages were replaced by gross tonnage and net tonnage, respectively, when the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted The International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships on 23 June 1969. The new tonnage regulations entered into force for all new ships on 18 July 1982, but existing vessels were given a migration period of 12 years to ensure that ships were given reasonable economic safeguards, since port and other dues are charged according to ship's tonnage. Since 18 July 1994 the gross and net tonnages, dimensionless indices calculated from the total moulded volume of the ship and its cargo spaces by mathematical formulae, have been the only official measures of the ship's tonnage. However, the gross and net register tonnages are still widely used in describing older ships.\n"}

Unlike other neighboring Mongolic languages, it has neither vowel harmony nor distinctions of vowel length.\nPlural marking: Suffix Condition -la any noun Examples ~oni 'sheep1 eoni-la 'sheep' -sla/-sila certain noun and pronoun in 'girl' o~in-sla 'girls' -pi only noun indicating relatives gajieiau 'brother' gajieiau-pi 'brothers'\nIn common with other Mongolic languages, Dongxiang is basically a SOV language. In Linxia, however, under the influence of the Mandarin Chinese dialects spoken by the neighbouring Hui people, sentences of the SVO type have also been observed.\n\nKnowledge of Arabic is widespread among the Sarta, and as a result, they often use the Arabic script to write down their language informally (cf. the Xiao'erjing system that was used by Hui people); however, this has been little investigated by scholars. , the official Latin alphabet for Dongxiang, developed on the basis of the Monguor alphabet, remained in the experimental stage.\n\nThere are about 20,000 people in the north-eastern part Dongxiang County, who self-identify as Dongxiang or Hui people who do not speak Dongxiang, but natively speak a Dongxiang-influenced form of Mandarin Chinese. The linguist Mei W. Lee-Smith calls this the \"Tangwang language\" (), based on the names of the two largest villages (Tangjia and Wangjia, parts of Tangwang Town) where it is spoken and argues it is a creolized language.\n\nAccording to Lee-Smith, the Tangwang language uses mostly Mandarin words and morphemes with Dongxiang grammar. Besides Dongxiang loanwords, Tangwang also has a substantial number of Arabic and Persian loanwords.\n\nLike standard Mandarin, Tangwang is a tonal language, but grammatical particles, which are typically borrowed from Mandarin, but are used in the way Dongxiang morphemes would be used in Dongxiang, don't carry tones.\n\nFor example, while the Mandarin plural suffix \"-men\" (们) has only very restricted usage (it can be used with personal pronouns and some nouns related to people), Tangwang uses it, in the form \"-m\", universally, the way Dongxiang would use its plural suffix \"-la\". Mandarin pronoun \"ni\" (你) can be used in Tangwang as a possessive suffix (meaning \"your\").\nUnlike Mandarin, but like Dongxiang, Tangwang has grammatical cases as well (however only four of them, unlike eight in Dongxiang).\n\n"}
{"id": "9913471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9913471", "title": "Sign language in Singapore", "text": "Sign language in Singapore\n\nThere is no officially recognized national sign language in Singapore. Since Singapore's independence in 1965, the Singapore deaf community has had to adapt to many linguistic changes. Today, the local deaf community recognizes Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) as a reflection of Singapore's diverse linguistic culture. SgSL is influenced by Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL), American Sign Language (ASL), Signing Exact English (SEE-II) and locally developed signs. The total number of deaf clients registered with The Singapore Association For The Deaf (SADeaf), an organisation that advocates equal opportunity for the deaf, is 5756, as of 2014. \n\nThe history of sign language in Singapore can be traced back to 1951 when Peng Tsu Ying left China for Singapore to teach deaf children in their homes. Born in Shanghai, Peng became deaf at the age of 6, and was educated in Hong Kong School for the Deaf (now known as Chun Tok School) and Shanghai Chung Wah School for the Deaf. With Peng’s education background in Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL) and together with a group of Chinese merchants, in March 1954, the Singapore Chinese Sign School for the deaf was opened. At that time, Singapore was predominantly Chinese and many diverse varieties were spoken. Peng and his wife, also deaf, used SSL in the sign school to teach children to read in Chinese and other subjects at the primary level.\n\nDuring the same period in the early 1950s, the Singapore Red Cross began conducting oral classes for deaf children and provided counselling services for parents of deaf children. As the demand for classes increased, the Singapore Red Cross Society and officials of the Social Welfare Department founded The Singapore Association For The Deaf (SADeaf) (then known as Singapore Deaf and Dumb Association) in 1955. \nIt was in 1963 when the sign school and the oral school merged to become the Singapore School for the Deaf (SSD). Within the same premises, students in the oral section of the school were taught in English as the medium of instruction, while students in the signing section of the school were taught in Chinese, with SSL as the medium of instruction.\n\nThe bilingual education policy, which came into effect in 1966, marked a linguistic transition for Singapore. The policy places English as the main medium of instruction. Since English became the language of instruction in the education sector, parents could choose education through any one of the four official languages (Mandarin, Malay, Tamil) but all students also had to study English, in non-English-medium schools. The government then required all schools to teach Math and Science in English starting at primary one.\n\nThis policy is significant to the local deaf community because it has marked a change in educating the deaf. Singapore, once under colonial rule, had been influenced by the British in learning English through the oral method. Furthermore, mainstream education in Singapore was moving towards English education and schools were beginning to switch to English as a medium of instruction. This posed a dilemma to the deaf community because the oral method was not suited to every student. While parents wanted their children to learn English, they have been learning SSL, which was associated with written Chinese.\n\nLim Chin Heng, a former student under Peng, went to the United States of America (USA) to learn English and their sign system, the American Sign Language (ASL). While studying, Lim also got to know some of the professors and authors in USA who were developing a sign system to teach English specifically, called Signing Exact English (SEE-II). Lim became the first Singaporean to enter Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C, an American university for the deaf. He graduated in with a degree in Mathematics, returned to Singapore and introduced ASL to the deaf community by 1974. Written English was known to be associated with ASL because ASL has seen the least number of generational breaks and was well-transmitted as compared to European counterparts. The international deaf community looked up to America as having a strong tradition in protecting their deaf and deaf rights. Hence, ASL was adopted to teach English as a medium of instruction to the deaf because it was seen as the best sign language to learn English.\n\nIn 1976, SADeaf invited Frances M. Parsons, then an associate professor at the Gallaudet University to promote Total Communication. Total Communication is a philosophy which uses signs, speech, gestures, speech reading, amplification, finger spelling, and/ or other mode of communication to provide linguistic input to deaf children. In the same year, Lim also brought back SEE-II to the local deaf community.\n\nBy 1977, the Total Communication approach was fully implemented in SSD. Lim also taught basic ASL classes for teachers and eventually ASL was taught to students in SSD. By 1978, SEE-II was adopted as the mode of communication and instruction by SADeaf in its affiliated schools, in SSD and Vocational School for the Handicapped (now known as Mountbatten Vocational School). However, the sign section of SSD, which used SSL, was phased out in 1983 because there were gradually fewer parents who opted for a Chinese education for their deaf children.\n\nIn 1985, SADeaf joined the World Federation of the Deaf.\n\nThe term Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) was coined by Andrew Tay in 2008. Tay emphasized the importance of SgSL in the deaf community to help deaf people develop their self-esteem, self-confidence, cognitive power as well as recognize their deaf identity.\n\nToday, sign language used in Singapore is a continually developing blend of Shanghainese, American and locally generated signs. It comprises different types of systems, including SEE-II, Pidgin Signed English (PSE) and gestures. SgSL is socially recognised and accepted by the deaf community in Singapore, and is a reflection of Singapore's diverse linguistic culture.\n\nWhile Singapore does not have a national sign language, the local deaf community recognizes Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) as Singapore’s native sign language. This is because sign language in Singapore has developed over the last 6 decades since the setting up of the first school for local deaf in 1954. Hence, there is crucial need to preserve and maintain local signs invented by the deaf community in Singapore since the early 1950s. Various sign languages have been adopted and used by the local deaf community as a result of linguistic changes. SgSL is influenced by Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL), American Sign Language (ASL), Signing Exact English (SEE-II) and locally developed signs. It also comprises different types of systems, including SEE-II, Pidgin Signed English (PSE) and gestures. Today, SgSL consists of the following language and sign systems:\n\nPidgin Signed English (PSE) is a variety or style of language that arises from contact between natural sign language (in this case being SgSL) and the surrounding spoken language, or between different sign languages. It involves the use of SgSL following the spoken English Language word order with simplified or reduced grammar. The use of PSE also occurs when there is contact between two sign languages. In this instance, foreign signs borrowing, code switching, fingerspelling, mouthing, and mixed systems are used.\n\nSEE-II is a Manually Coded English system. It is a sign system that English Language visual through the hands. It was developed in 1969 in Southern California, USA with the aim of teaching deaf children English. About 75% to 80% of SEE-II signs are either borrowed from ASL or modified ASL signs. Unlike ASL, SEE-II is not a language but merely a mode of communication.\n\nChildren with hearing impairments receive education through the oral approach method at the Canossian School for the Hearing Impaired (CSHI). The Directory of Services for the Disabled states that students at CSHI are taught using the Natural Auditory-Oral Philosophy, which emphasises the use of audition. Unlike students from the Singapore School of the Deaf (SSD), which is at present the only other Singaporean school specialized in education for deaf children, teaching is done without any form of signs or sign language. Hearing-impaired pupils in general public schools access the school curriculum through speech, in the same environment like their hearing classmates.\n\nThe technological progress and development of hearing aids and cochlear implants allow hearing-impaired children to participate in class. Additional therapy programmes provided by schools and other specialized institutions, as in the case of CSHI with their Audio Verbal Therapy (AVT) or the Listen and Talk programme at the Singapore General Hospital, aim to improve performance of hearing-impaired children in a beneficial setting. The Listen and Talk Programme uses the Auditory-Verbal approach, which helps children access speech and language primarily through auditory input. It allows to integrate affected children in mainstream schools so that their hearing classmates function as important language models in their learning process.\n\nAmerican Sign Language (ASL) was introduced to Singapore’s deaf community by Lim Chin Heng, in 1974. Lim Chin Heng was instructed by Peng Tsu Ying and additionally studied English and ASL at Gallaudet University in the United States. During that period, mainstream education in Singapore shifted from a diverse to a uniform language teaching system. English was promoted as the language of instruction in Singaporean schools, and therefore ASL served as a medium of instruction. ASL is still used in Singapore today.\n\nSigning Exact English (SEE-II) is not a language itself but a sign coded version of English, meaning it utilises the vocabulary of ASL with the English grammar. \n\nSign language is often viewed as subordinate to spoken language. For both adults and children within the deaf community, this perception, to some extent, leads to them becoming unable to learn sign language, which negatively impacts them socially. The Deaf and Hard of Hearing Federation of Singapore acknowledges that sign language is not the popular choice to educate the deaf population, but it is of good benefit for parents to expose their deaf children to both sign and oral language.\n\nIt is difficult to determine if a bilingual (native sign language and English) education program for the deaf in Singapore would be beneficial, since little is known about their language. There is a lack of government documentation that recognizes a native sign language in Singapore, thus there is also not much regulation in place to monitor how useful sign language is for Singaporeans and its deaf population; it is a continuing process in improving its application.\n\nIn Singapore, no one has been able to identify a language that is native of the deaf population, although the public would say that the deaf use \"sign language\" to communicate. This \"sign language\", Signing Exact English (SEE-II), is not a sign language, but a Manually Coded English sign system. While the SEE-II system is continually being used to help deaf people improve their grasp of English, Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) is evolving as another method for them to communicate. And both of these systems pose challenges to establishing sign language as a standard in Singapore.\n\nThe use of SEE-II to educate Singaporean deaf children and even adults, is an ongoing issue. This is because most of the deaf population in Singapore are not raised in English-speaking homes. Thus, parents have a difficulty learning sign language because these classes are conducted only in English and SEE-II. The idea behind these systems is that Deaf children will learn English better if they are exposed, visually through signs, to the grammatical features of English. However, exposure to them does not always provide children with the complete linguistic access, which is needed to internalize the whole language. So, there needs to be a better way for parents with hearing-impaired children to effectively communicate with them. On the other hand, if this concern with SEE-II is left unaddressed, more parents may choose to not educate their sons and/or daughters using SEE-II or sign language.\n\nThere is a need to standardize the use of Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) based on cultural elements. Language instruction of Signing Exact English for the Deaf does not get used when they are amongst themselves in the deaf community. Despite SEE-II being adopted as the language of instruction among deaf children in Singapore since 1977, and its use as a system of communication in the Deaf community in Singapore, it is of utmost importance to preserve and maintain local signs invented by the Deaf community in Singapore since the early 1950s. With Singapore Sign Language (SgSL), depending on the background of the Deaf, local signs of SgSL often are invented and used by them, and they are not necessarily formally and officially indexed. This is a concern such that essentially, the SgSL language lends itself to many ambiguities when it comes to its expression. Additionally, Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) has not gone through any form of linguistic research/study; this is because of a lack in government resources and funding. This basically means that it is hard to rely on the deaf population to provide updates on the local vocabularies and sign systems of SgSL, and poses an even greater obstacle for the Sign Language Interpreting community in gaining a better handle on and about the language itself.\n\nCurrently, the Linguistic Sub-Committee at the Singapore Association does exciting research into SgSL for the Deaf (SADeaf). They aim to set up a sign bank to record locally developed signs and also to better understand SgSL so as to create resources for the general public as well as members of the Deaf community. They are trying to progress in the research of SgSL in order to lead to corpus development. And out of corpus development, the aim is to produce material that is more accurate in the teaching of the sign language. This, however, will take a long time to happen, for this is still in the beginning stages; this is the case because the matter is highly complex in Singapore.\n\nThe Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) linguistics sub-committee has been formed to perform research on SgSL that will eventually lead to corpus development, which will be used to produce material that is more accurate in the teaching of SgSL. The committee is currently in its second term. Plans have also been made to start a preschool that focuses on language acquisition.\n\nIn addition, SADeaf organises carnivals and exhibition with its partners to reach out and promote public understanding of deafness and awareness of deaf people in the society. SADeaf has recently organised SgSL Week 2014, from 22 to 28 September 2014, in conjunction with International Week for the Deaf. The theme for International Week for the Deaf is “Strengthening Human Diversity”. The SgSL Week is a platform for the local deaf community to stand proud as Deaf, and to promote the awareness of SgSL and Deaf culture.\n\nBased on the situation in Singapore, there are further recommendations that may be made in order for Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) to progress further, and establish itself in a more prominent sense. More hearing people in Singapore will need to be educated in SgSL, learn it and the manual alphabet to provide more communication and social interaction between deaf and the hearing populations alike. What has been recognized is the need to give every deaf child as early as possible in his/her life as much language education as possible through whatever correct communication input; sign language education to meet their needs; need not there to be method(s) of communication to the exclusion of others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2734849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2734849", "title": "Skolt Sami language", "text": "Skolt Sami language\n\nSkolt Sami ( 'the Saami language' or \"nuõrttsääʹmǩiõll\" if a distinction needs to be made between it and the other Sami languages) is a Uralic, Sami language that is spoken by the Skolts, with approximately 300 speakers in Finland, mainly in Sevettijärvi and approximately 20–30 speakers of the Njuõʹttjäuʹrr (Notozero) dialect in an area surrounding Lake Lovozero in Russia. Skolt Sami also used to be spoken in the Neiden area of Norway. It is written using a modified Roman orthography which was made official in 1973.\n\nThe term \"Skolt\" was coined by representatives of the majority culture and has negative connotation which can be compared to the term \"Lapp\". Nevertheless it is used in cultural and linguistic studies.\nOn Finnish territory Skolt Sami was spoken in four villages before the Second World War. In Petsamo, Skolt Sami was spoken in Suonikylä and the village of Petsamo. This area was ceded to Russia in the Second World War, and the Skolts were evacuated to the villages of Inari, Sevettijärvi and Nellim in the Inari municipality. \n\nOn the Russian (then Soviet) side the dialect was spoken in the now defunct Sami settlements of Motovsky, Songelsky, Notozero (hence its Russian name – the \"Notozersky\" dialect). Some speakers still may live in the villages of Tuloma and Lovozero.\n\nSkolt Sami is spoken by approximately 400 people by the government as one of the official Sami languages used in Lapland and can thus be used by anyone conducting official business in that area. It is an official language in the municipality of Inari, and elementary schools there offer courses in the language, both for native speakers and for students learning it as a foreign language. Only a small number of youths do learn the language and continue to use it actively. Skolt Sami is thus a seriously endangered language, even more seriously than Inari Sami in the same municipality, which has a nearly equal number of speakers.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1986, the Skolts had a quarterly called Sääʹmođđâz published in their own language. Since 2013 a new magazine called Tuõddri pee'rel has been published once a year.\n\nIn 1993, language immersion programs for children younger than 7 were created. At present, however, no funding has been forthcoming for these programs in years and as a result they are on hold. These programs were extremely important in creating the youngest generation of Skolt Sami speakers. In recent years, these programs have been reinstated.\n\nLike Inari Sami, Skolt Sami has recently borne witness to a new phenomenon, namely it is being used in rock songs\nsung by Tiina Sanila, who has published two full-length CDs in Skolt Sami to date.\n\nIn addition, 2005 saw the first time that it was possible to use Skolt Sami in a Finnish matriculation examination, albeit as a foreign language. In 2012, Ville-Riiko Fofonoff () was the first person to have Skolt Sami for the mother tongue portion of the exam; for this, he won the Skolt of the Year Award the same year. \n\nThe Finnish news program Yle Ođđasat featured a Skolt Sami speaking newsreader for the first time on 26 August 2016. Otherwise Yle Ođđasat presents individual news stories in Skolt Sami every now and then. In addition, there have been various TV programs in Skolt Sámi on YLE such as the children's TV series \"Binnabánnaš\".\n\nSkolt Sami uses the ISO basic Latin alphabet with the addition of some special characters:\n\nNotes:\n\nAdditional marks are used in writing Skolt Sami words:\n\nSpecial features of this Sami language include a highly complex vowel system and a suprasegmental contrast of palatalized vs. non-palatalized stress groups; palatalized stress groups are indicated by a \"softener mark\", represented by the modifier letter prime (ʹ).\n\nThe system of vowel phonemes is as follows:\n\nLong and short vowels contrast phonologically: cf. \"leʹtt\" ‘vessel’ vs. \"leeʹtt\" ‘vessels’. All vowels can occur as both long and short.\n\nThe vowels can combine to form twelve opening diphthongs:\n\nAll diphthongs can occur as both long and short, although this is not indicated in spelling. Short diphthongs are distinguished from long ones by both length and stress placement: short diphthongs have a stressed second component, whereas long diphthongs have stress on the first component. \n\nDiphthongs may also have two variants depending on whether they occur in a plain or palatalized environment. This has a clearer effect with diphthongs whose second element is back or central. Certain inflectional forms, including the addition of the palatalizing suprasegmental, also trigger a change in diphthong quality.\n\nThe inventory of consonant phonemes is the following:\n\n\nConsonants may be phonemically short or long (geminate) both word-medially or word-finally; both are exceedingly common. Long and short consonants also contrast in consonant clusters, cf. \"kuõskkâd\" 'to touch' : \"kuõskâm\" 'I touch'. A short period of voicelessness or \"h\", known as preaspiration, before geminate consonants is observed, much as in Icelandic, but this is not marked orthographically, e.g. \"joʹǩǩe\" 'to the river' is pronounced .\n\nThere is one phonemic suprasegmental, the palatalizing suprasegmental that affects the pronunciation of an entire syllable. In written language the palatalizing suprasegmental is indicated with a free-standing acute accent between a stressed vowel and the following consonant, as follows:\n\nThe suprasegmental palatalization has three distinct phonetic effects:\n\n\nSkolt Sami has four different types of stress for words:\n\n\nThe first syllable of any word is always the primary stressed syllable in Skolt Sami as Skolt is a fixed-stress language. In words with two or more syllables, the final syllable is quite lightly stressed (tertiary stress) and the remaining syllable, if any, are stressed more heavily than the final syllable, but less than the first syllable (secondary stress).\n\nUsing the abessive and the comitative singular in a word appears to disrupt this system, however, in words of more than one syllable. The suffix, as can be expected, has tertiary stress, but the penultimate syllable also has tertiary stress, even though it would be expected to have secondary stress.\n\nZero stress can be said to be a feature of conjunctions, postpositions, particles and monosyllabic pronouns.\n\nSkolt Sami is a synthetic, highly inflected language that shares many grammatical features with the other Uralic languages. However, Skolt Sami is not a typical agglutinative language like many of the other Uralic languages are, as it has developed considerably into the direction of a fusional language, much like Estonian. Therefore, cases and other grammatical features are also marked by modifications to the root and not just marked with suffixes. Many of the suffixes in Skolt Sami are portmanteau morphemes that express several grammatical features at a time.\n\nUmlaut is a pervasive phenomenon in Skolt Sami, whereby the vowel in the second syllable affects the quality of the vowel in the first. The presence of absence of palatalisation can also be considered an umlaut effect, since it is also conditioned by the second-syllable vowel, although it affects the entire syllable rather than the vowel alone. Umlaut is complicated by the fact that many of the second-syllable vowels have disappeared in Skolt Sami, leaving the umlaut effects as their only trace.\n\nThe following table lists the Skolt Sami outcomes of the Proto-Samic first-syllable vowel, for each second-syllable vowel.\n\nSome notes:\n\nAs can be seen, palatalisation is present before original second-syllable \"*ē\" and \"*i\", and absent otherwise. Where they survive in Skolt Sami, both appear as \"e\", so only the umlaut effect can distinguish them. The original short vowels \"*ë\", \"*u\" and \"*i\" have a general raising and backing effect on the preceding vowel, while the effect of original \"*ā\" and \"*ō\" is lowering. Original \"*ē\" is fronting (palatalising) without having an effect on height.\n\nSkolt Sami has 9 cases in the singular (7 of which also have a plural form), although the genitive and accusative are often the same. \n\nThe following table shows the inflection of \"čuäcc\" ('rotten snag') with the single morphemes marking noun stem, number, and case separated by hyphens for better readability. The last morpheme marks for case, \"i\" marks the plural, and \"a\" is due to epenthesis and does not have a meaning of its own. \n\nLike the other Uralic languages, the nominative singular is unmarked and indicates the subject or a predicate. The nominative plural is also unmarked and always looks the same as the genitive singular.\n\nThe \"genitive\" singular is unmarked and looks the same as the nominative plural. The genitive plural is marked by an \"-i\". The genitive is used:\n\n\nThe genitive has been replacing the partitive for some time and is nowadays more commonly used in its place.\n\nThe accusative is the direct object case and it is unmarked in the singular. In the plural, its marker is \"-d\", which is preceded by the plural marker \"-i\", making it look the same as the plural illative. The accusative is also used to mark some adjuncts, e.g. \"obb tääʹlv\" ('the entire winter').\n\nThe locative marker in the singular is \"-st\" and \"-n\" in the plural. This case is used to indicate:\n\n\nIn addition, it is used with certain verbs:\n\n\nThe illative marker actually has three different markers in the singular to represent the same case: \"-a\", \"-e\" and \"-u\". The plural illative marker is \"-d\", which is preceded by the plural marker \"-i\", making it look the same as the plural accusative. This case is used to indicate:\n\n\nThe comitative marker in the singular is \"-in\" and \"-vuiʹm\" in the plural. The comitative is used to state \"with whom or what\" something was done:\n\n\nTo form the comitative singular, use the genitive singular form of the word as the root and \"-in\". To form the comitative plural, use the plural genitive root and \"-vuiʹm\".\n\nThe abessive marker is \"-tää\" in both the singular and the plural. It always has a tertiary stress.\n\n\nThe dual form of the essive is still used with pronouns, but not with nouns and does not appear at all in the plural.\n\nThe partitive is only used in the singular and can always be replaced by the genitive. The partitive marker is \"-d\".\n\n1. It appears after numbers larger than six:\n\n\nThis can be replaced with \"kääʹuc čâustõõǥǥ\".\n\n2. It is also used with certain postpositions:\n\n\nThis can be replaced with \"kuäʹđ vuâstta'\n\n3. It can be used with the comparative to express that which is being compared:\n\n\nThis would nowadays more than likely be replaced by \"pueʹrab ko kåʹll\"\n\nThe personal pronouns have three numbers: singular, plural and dual. The following table contains personal pronouns in the nominative and genitive/accusative cases.\n\nThe next table demonstrates the declension of a personal pronoun \"he/she\" (no gender distinction) in various cases:\n\nNext to number and case, Skolt Sami nouns also inflect for possession. However, usage of possessive affixes seems to decrease among speakers. The following table shows possessive inflection of the word \"muõrr\" ('tree'). \nSkolt Sami verbs inflect (inflection of verbs is also referred to as conjugation) for person, mood, number, and tense. A full inflection table of all person-marked forms of the verb \"kuullâd\" ('to hear') is given below. \n\nIt can be seen that inflection involves changes to the verb stem as well as inflectional suffixes. Changes to the stem are based on verbs being categorized into several inflectional classes. The different inflectional suffixes are based on the categories listed below. \n\nSkolt Sami verbs conjugate for four grammatical persons:\n\n\nSkolt Sami has 5 grammatical moods:\n\n\nSkolt Sami verbs conjugate for two grammatical numbers:\n\n\nUnlike other Sami varieties, Skolt Sami verbs do not inflect for dual number. Instead, verbs occurring with the dual personal pronouns appear in the corresponding plural form.\n\nSkolt Sami has 2 simple tenses:\n\n\nand 2 compound tenses:\n\n\nThe verb forms given above are person-marked, also referred to as finite. In addtition to the finite forms, Skolt Sami verbs have twelve participial and converb forms, as well as the infinitive, which are non-finite. These forms are given in the table below for the verb \"kuullâd\" ('to hear'). \nSkolt Sami has two auxiliary verbs, one of which is \"lee´d\" (glossed as 'to be'), the other one is the negative auxiliary verb (see the following paragraph).\n\nInflection of \"lee´d\" is given below.\n\n\"Lee'd\" is used, for example, to assign tense to lexical verbs in the conditional or potential mood which are not marked for tense themselves: \n\n\n(negation (1st P. Sg.) – then – 1st P. Sg. – even – ask (negated conditional) – if – 1st P. Sg. – know (1st P. Sg. conditional) – be (1st P. Sg. conditional) – soup – make (past participle, no tense marking) – before) \n\n'I wouldn't even ask if I knew, if I had made soup before!' \n\nSkolt Sami, like Finnish, the other Sami languages and Estonian, has a negative verb. In Skolt Sami, the negative verb conjugates according to mood (indicative, imperative and optative), person (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th) and number (singular and plural).\nNote that \"ij\" + \"leat\" is usually written as \"iʹlla\", \"iʹlleäkku\", \"iʹllää\" or \"iʹllä\" and \"ij\" + \"leat\" is usually written as \"jeäʹla\" or \"jeäʹlä\".\n\nUnlike the other Sami languages, Skolt Sami no longer has separate forms for the dual and plural of the negative verb and uses the plural forms for both instead.\n\nThe most frequent word order in simple, declarative sentences in Skolt Sami is subject-verb-object (SOV). However, as cases are used to mark relations between different noun phrases, and verb forms mark person and number of the subject, Skolt Sami word order allows for some variation.\n\nAn example of an SOV sentence would be:\n\n\nIntransitive sentences follow the order subject-verb (SV): \n\n\nAn exception to the SOV word order can be found in sentences with an auxiliary verb. While in other languages, an OV word order has been found to correlate with the auxiliary verb coming after the lexical verb, the Skolt Sami auxiliary verb \"lee'd\" ('to be') precedes the lexical verb. This has been related to the verb-second (V2) phenomenon which binds the finite verb to at most the second position of the respective clause. However, in Skolt Sami, this effect seems to be restricted to clauses with an auxiliary verb. \n\nAn example of a sentence with the auxiliary in V2 position: \n\n\nIn Skolt Sami, polar questions, also referred to as yes-no questions, are marked in two different ways. Morphologically, an interrogative particle, \"-a\", is added as an affix to the first word of the clause. Syntactically, the element which is in the scope of the question is moved to the beginning of the clause. If this element is the verb, subject and verb are inversed in comparison to the declarative SOV word order. \n\n\nIf an auxiliary verb is used, this is the one which is moved to the initial sentence position and also takes the interrogative affix. \n\n\nA negated polar question, using the negative auxiliary verb, shows the same structure: \n\n\nAn example of the interrogative particle being added to something other than the verb, would be the following: \n\n\nInformation questions in Skolt Sami are formed with a question word in clause-initial position. There also is a gap in the sentence indicating the missing piece of information. This kind of structure is similar to Wh-movement in languages such as English. There are mainly three question words corresponding to the English 'what', 'who', and 'which' (out of two). They inflect for number and case, except for the latter which only has singular forms. It is noteworthy that the illative form of \"mii\" ('what') corresponds to the English 'why'. The full inflectional paradigm of all three question words can be found below.\n\nSome examples of information questions using one of the three question words: \n\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned, there are other question words which are not inflected, such as the following: \n\n\nAn example sentence would be the following: \n\n\nThe Skolt Sami imperative generally takes a clause-initial position. Out of the five imperative forms (see above), those of the second person are most commonly used. \n\n\nImperatives in the first person form, which only exist as plurals, are typically used for hortative constructions, that is for encouraging the listener (not) to do something. These imperatives include both the speaker and the listener. \n\n\nFinally, imperatives in the third person are used in jussive constructions, the mood used for orders and commands. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7096786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7096786", "title": "Trique language", "text": "Trique language\n\nThe Triqui (), or Trique, languages are Oto-Manguean languages of Mexico spoken by the Trique people of the state of Oaxaca and the state of Baja California (due to recent population movements). They belong to the Mixtecan branch together with the Mixtec languages and Cuicatec.\n\n\"Ethnologue\" lists three major varieties: \n\nMexico's federal agency for its indigenous languages, Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI), identifies four varieties of Trique in its \"Catálogo de las lenguas indígenas nacionales\" published in early 2008. The variants listed by INALI are:\n\nAll varieties of Triqui are tonal and have complex phonologies. The tone system of Copala Triqui is the best described and has eight tones.\n\nTones in Triqui languages are typically written with superscript numbers, so that \"chraa\" 'river' indicates the syllable \"chraa\" with the highest (5) tone, while \"chana\" 'woman' has the middle (3) tone on the first syllable and the lowest (1) tone on the second syllable.\n\nOf the Triqui languages, the Copala dialect has undergone the most vowel loss, with many non-final syllables losing their vowels. The result, as in many other Oto-Manguean languages, is a complex set of consonant clusters. So, for instance, the word \"sikuj\" 'cow' in Itunyoso Triqui corresponds to \"skuj\" in Copala Triqui.\n\nThe tonal phonology of other Triqui languages is more complex than Copala Triqui. The tone system of Itunyoso Triqui has nine tones. The tone system of Chicahuaxtla Triqui has at least 10 tones but may have as many as 16.\n\nTriqui has been written in a number of different orthographies, depending on the intended audience. Linguists typically write the language with all tones fully marked and all phonemes represented. However, in works intended for native speakers of Triqui, a practical orthography is often used with a somewhat simpler representation.\n\nThe following Copala Triqui example is written in both the linguistic and the practical orthographies:\n\n'To whom are you speaking?' (¿Con quién estás hablando?)\n\nTriqui morphology is fairly limited. Verbs take a /k-/ prefix (spelled \"c-\" or \"qu-\") to show completive aspect:\n\nA'mii zo'.\n'You are speaking'.\n\nC-a'mii zo'.\n'You spoke'.\n\nThe same /k-/ prefix plus a tonal change shows the potential aspect:\n\nC-a'mii zo'.\n'You will speak.'\n\nThe tonal changes associated with the potential aspect are complex but always involve lowering the tone of the root (Hollenbach 1984).\n\nThere are also complex phonological processes that are triggered by the presence of root-final clitic pronouns. These pronouns (especially the first- and the second-person singular) may change the shape of the stem or alter its tone.\n\nAs a language subfamily, Triqui is interesting for having a large tonal inventory, complex morphophonology, and interesting syntactic phenomena, much of which has yet to be described.\n\nCopala Triqui has a verb-subject-object word order:\n'Maria put the tortilla in the tenate.'\n\nCopala Triqui has an accusative marker maa or man, which is obligatory for animate pronominal objects but optional otherwise:\n'Maria saw the tortilla.'\n'Maria saw you.'\n\nThis use of the accusative before some objects and not others is what is called differential object marking.\n\nThe following example (repeated from above) shows a Copala Triqui question:\n\n'To whom are you speaking?' (¿Con quién estas hablando?)\n\nAs this example shows, Copala Trique has wh-movement and pied-piping with inversion.\n\nCopala Triqui syntax is described in Hollenbach (1992).\n\nTriqui is interesting for having toggle processes as well. For negation, a completive aspect prefix signifies the negative potential. A potential aspect prefix in the same context signifies the negative completive.\n\nThe following is a sample of Copala Triqui taken from a legend about the sun and the moon. The first column is Copala Triqui, the second is a Spanish translation, and the third is an English translation. \nTriqui-language programming is carried by the CDI's radio stations XEQIN-AM, based in San Quintín, Baja California, and XETLA, based in Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca.\n\nAs of 2012, the Natividad Medical Center of Salinas, California was training medical interpreters bilingual in one of the Oaxacan languages (including Trique, Mixteco, or Zapotec), as well as in Spanish. In March 2014, Natividad Medical Foundation launched Indigenous Interpreting+, \"a community and medical interpreting business specializing in indigenous languages from Mexico and Central and South America,\" including Trique, Mixteco, Zapotec, and Chatino.\n\nA Trique-speaking community has also settled in Albany, New York, as well as in northwestern Washington.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4306376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4306376", "title": "Yiddish orthography", "text": "Yiddish orthography\n\nYiddish orthography is the writing system used for the Yiddish language. It includes Yiddish spelling rules and the Hebrew script, which is used as the basis of a full vocalic alphabet. Letters that are silent or glottal stops in the Hebrew language are used as vowels in Yiddish. Other letters that can serve as both vowels and consonants are either read as appropriate to the context in which they appear or are differentiated by diacritical marks derived from the Hebrew \"nikkud\", commonly referred to as \"points\". Additional phonetic distinctions between letters that share the same base character are also indicated by pointing or by the adjacent placement of otherwise silent base characters. Several Yiddish points are not commonly used in any present-day Hebrew context and others are used in a manner that is specific to Yiddish orthography. There is significant variation in the way this is applied in literary practice. There are also several differing approaches to the disambiguation of characters that can be used as either vowels or consonants.\n\nWords of Aramaic and Hebrew origin are normally written in the traditional orthography of the source language—i.e., the orthography of these words, which is consonant-based, is generally preserved (Niborski 2012). All other Yiddish words are represented with a phonemic orthography. Both forms can appear in a single word—for example, where a Yiddish affix is applied to a Hebrew stem. Yiddish pointing may also be applied to words that are otherwise written entirely with traditional orthography.\n\nIn the early 20th century, for cultural and political reasons, efforts were initiated toward the development of a uniform Yiddish orthography. A specimen initial practice was described in detail by the Yiddish lexicographer Alexander Harkavy in a \"Treatise on Yiddish Reading, Orthography, and Dialectal Variations\" first published in 1898 together with his Yiddish-English Dictionary (Harkavy 1898). Additional illustrations of this variation are provided in source excerpts in Fishman 1981, which also contains a number of texts specifically about the need (pro and con) for a uniform orthography. A detailed chronology of the major events during this normative action, including rosters of conference participants, bibliographic references to the documents they produced, and summaries of their contents, is given in Yiddish in Schaechter 1999. There is a less detailed (but extensive nonetheless) English language review of this process in Estraikh 1999.\n\nThe first action formally undertaken by a government was in the Soviet Union in 1920, abolishing the separate etymological orthography for words of Semitic (i.e., Hebrew and Aramaic) origin. This was extended twelve years later with the elimination of the five separate final-form consonants (as indicated in the table below) which were, however, widely reintroduced in 1961. The changes are both illustrated in the way the name of the author Sholem Aleichem is written. His own work uses the form שלום־עליכם but in Soviet publication this is respelled phonetically to שאָלעמ־אלײכעמ also dispensing with the separate final-form \"mem\" and using the initial/medial form instead. This can be seen, together with a respelling of the name of the protagonist of his Tevye der milkhiker (originally טביה, changed to טעוויע), by comparing the title pages of that work in the U.S. and Soviet editions illustrated next to this paragraph. Note also the Germanized מילכיגער (\"milkhiger\") in the former exemplifying another widespread trend, \"daytshmerish\", discussed further below.\n\nThe efforts preliminary to the 1920 reform, which took place in several countries — most notably in Poland with focus on a uniform school curriculum — resulted in other devices that were not implemented as a result of any governmental mandate. These were further considered during the 1930s by the \"Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut\", YIVO (YIVO 1930). This led to the development of their תּקנות פֿון ייִדישן אויסלייג (\"takones fun yidishn oysleyg\" - \"Rules of Yiddish Orthography\"), also known as the \"SYO\" (\"Standard Yiddish Orthography\") or the \"YIVO Rules\" (1st edition YIVO 1935, current edition SYO 1999). This has become the most frequently referenced such system in present-day use. Although it regularly figures in pedagogical contexts, it would be misleading to suggest that it is similarly dominant elsewhere. Other orthographies are frequently encountered in contemporary practice and are house standards for many publishers.\n\nA useful review of this variation is provided in the Oxford University כלל־תקנות פון יידישן אויסלייג (\"klal takones fun yidishn oysleyg\" - \"Standard Rules of Yiddish Orthography\") (Oxford 1992 and available online), written in and codifying a more conventional orthography than the one put forward by YIVO. Differences in the systems can be seen simply by comparing the titles of the two documents but they differ more fundamentally in their approaches to the prescription and description of orthographic detail. The former treats orthographic variation as a positive attribute of the Yiddish literature and describes essential elements of that variation. The latter presents a uniform Yiddish orthography, based on observed practice but with proactive prescriptive intent. Strong difference of opinion about the relative merit of the two approaches has been a prominent aspect of the discussion from the outset and shows little sign of abating. Although the Yiddish alphabet as stated in the SYO is widely accepted as a baseline reference (with a few minor but frequently encountered variations), the spelling and phonetics of the YIVO system of romanized transliteration discussed below, remain subjects of particular contention. The intent of the SYO is not to describe the spectrum of traditional orthographic practice. The bulk of Yiddish literature predates the formulation of those rules and the discrepancies are significant.\n\nA few Yiddish letters and letter combinations are pronounced quite differently in the various Yiddish dialects. Whatever impact this may have on the discussion of standardized orthography, it becomes a significant factor when Yiddish is transliterated into other scripts. It is entirely possible to assign a specific character or sequence of characters in, for example, the Roman alphabet to a specific character or character sequence in the Yiddish alphabet. The transliterated form will, however, be pronounced in a manner that appears natural to the reader. A choice therefore needs to be made about which of the several possible pronunciations of the Yiddish word is to be conveyed prior to its transliteration, with parallel attention to the phonemic attributes of the target language.\n\nThe romanization of Yiddish has been a focus of scholarly attention in Europe since the early 16th century. A detailed review of the various systems presented through the 17th century, including extensive source excerpts, is provided in Frakes 2007. The Harkavy treatise cited above describes a late 19th-century system that is based on the pronunciation of the Northeastern Yiddish dialect, Litvish, for an anglophone audience. This was also a mainstay of the standardization efforts of YIVO, resulting in the romanization system described in detail below. The Harkavy and YIVO initiatives provide a convenient framework within which intervening developments may be considered. There was significant debate about many aspects of that sequence, including the need for any form of standardized orthography at all (Fishman 1981).\n\nThe outright replacement of Hebrew script with Roman script in the native representation of written Yiddish was briefly considered. This had no impact on mainstream orthography but a number of Yiddish books are currently available in romanized editions. These include Yiddish dictionaries, a context in which consistent and phonetically tenable transliteration is essential.\n\nThere is no general agreement about the transliteration of Hebrew into the Roman alphabet. The Hebrew component of a Yiddish text will normally reflect the transliterator's preference without being seen as a component of the methodology applied to the romanization of words presented in the phonemic orthography.\n\nA transliteration system uses one script to represent another as closely as possible. It will normally permit unambiguous conversion back and forth between the two scripts. Where the intent is to indicate phonetic variation, some form of transcription will be required. This is frequently done by using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). There are also many contexts in which phonetic distinctions are indicated by the diacritical marking of the base characters, or through the similar use of some alternate script that is familiar to the intended audience. These approaches are all also seen in native Yiddish texts, where distinctions that cannot be directly represented with the basic Yiddish script but do need to be highlighted, are indicated by using additional Hebrew diacritical marks, with Roman letters, or with the IPA.\n\nThere is no intrinsic reason why a transcription scheme cannot also be used for transliteration. In general, however, there is no expectation that the representation of a word in the source script can be retrieved from a transcription. Its purpose is to indicate how a word is pronounced, not its native orthography.\n\nThe table in the following section indicates two alternatives each for romanized transliteration and phonetic transcription. It is keyed to the Yiddish character repertoire as codified by YIVO. Other transliteration systems are also regularly employed in a variety of contexts but no single one of them represents the full range of variant pronunciation in Yiddish dialects. Nor is the YIVO system equally appropriate phonetically to all languages using Roman script. This issue becomes particularly intricate when dealing with older texts where little is known about pronunciation, and transmitting the fullest possible detail of their notation is historically important. There are several approaches to the romanization of such material. The YIVO transliteration system is solely intended to serve as an English-oriented phonetic counterpart to the modern Standard Yiddish described (and to some extent prescribed) in the SYO. That work does, however, consider the transcription of variant pronunciation as will be discussed below.\n\nYIVO published a major study of the range of Yiddish phonetic variation in \"The Language and Cultural Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry\", commonly referred to as the LCAAJ. This uses a detailed system of marked Roman characters and suprasegmental marks to indicate that variation, and does not apply standard YIVO transliteration at all. Although the full phonetic transcription scheme is not amenable to presentation in the table below, its core elements have been included. This scheme has been used by later authors to indicate \"phonetic transcription\" and is labelled in that manner here. One recent example of this is provided in Jacobs 2005. Another transcription system frequently cited in academic contexts was devised and presented (in German) by Solomon Birnbaum in Birnbaum 1918 and used in his later German works, as well as his English publication Birnbaum 1979. This was intended to provide extreme flexibility in the representation of differences between dialects but failed to gain further practical acceptance due to its intricacy and idiosyncratic appearance (illustrated by Birnbaum's own transcription of a passage from Sholem Aleichem's, \"Shprintse\": \"\"Vaaihii haaiym, tréft zex a maasy, éiryv śvjjys iz dus gyvéin, kjm ex cj fuurn mit a bisl milexiks cj ainy fjn maany koinytys, a ijngy almuuny jn a raaxy fjn iékaterinoslav, vus is gykjmyn cj fuurn mit ir ziindl, aronćik haist er, kain boiberik ifn zjmer\", which in YIVO transliteration is, \"Vayehi hayoym, treft zikh a mayse, erev-shvues iz dos geven, kum ikh tsu forn mit a bisel milkhigs tsu eyner fun mayne kundes, a yunge almone un a raykhe fun katerineslav, vos iz gekumen tsu forn mit ihr zundl, arontshik heyst er, keyn boyberik oyfn zumer\"\").\n\nThis table lists the Yiddish alphabet as described in the Uriel Weinreich \"English–Yiddish–English Dictionary\" (Weinreich 1968), with a few variants that may be seen in readily available literature. The YIVO romanizations are taken from the same source, where they are presented as \"sound equivalents\". The romanizations indicated in Harkavy 1898 are included for comparison. The IPA transcriptions correspond to the examples provided by YIVO (with a few additional variants). The transcriptions in the following column were extrapolated from the LCAAJ. It is important to note that the elements of the two transcription systems appear in this table as appropriate to the standard pronunciation discussed under the next heading. The same elements, particularly those indicating vowels and diphthongs, are associated with other Yiddish letters when other pronunciations are being transcribed.\n\nThe table also includes several digraphs and a trigraph that are standard elements of the Yiddish writing system. They appear here in normal alphabetic order but are commonly collated separately at the end of a listing of the basic single-character alphabet.\n\nThe SYO is presented in Yiddish, and a few romanized transcriptions are included only where needed to indicate variant pronunciation. Given that the YIVO standardization initiative has been severely criticized for failing to accommodate such variation, it may be worth noting that the SYO explicitly references the three major branches of Eastern Yiddish — \"Litvish\" (Northern), \"Poylish\" (Central), and \"Ukrainish\" (Southern), as developed in the regions centered on present-day Lithuania/Belarus, Poland, and Ukraine/Moldova. The SYO gives dialect-specific romanized equivalents for the following characters:\n\nA few further romanized equivalents are provided but do not indicate dialectal differences. These are identical to what is contained in the table in the preceding section, with the following exceptions:\n\nYIVO took Litvish as the standard dialect with only slight modification, to a large extent because of the consistency with which its phonemic attributes could be represented by a standardized orthography similarly requiring only minimal elaboration of traditional practice. The important distinctions between Litvish, Poylish, and Ukrainish are therefore not indicated in either the SYO or Weinreich dictionary. These are, however, discussed in detail in the LCAAJ to which Uriel Weinreich was a major contributor. The Roman characters appearing in the SYO correspond to those used in the LCAAJ, and their marking according to Central European orthographic convention provides greater flexibility in notating dialectal distinction than does an English-oriented approach. Phonetic transcription is therefore common in linguistic discourse about Yiddish, often using a wide range of diacritical marks in clear contrast to the totally undecorated YIVO romanization.\n\nThe SYO listing of the Yiddish alphabet (which predates the Weinreich dictionary) explicitly states that the vowels with combining points, and the \"vov\" and \"yud\" digraphs, are not counted as separate letters, nor are the additional consonant digraphs and trigraphs listed at all:\n\"The order of the letters in the alphabet is as follows [from right to left]:\"\n‎\", \"‎\", \"‎\", \"‎\", \"‎\", \"‎\", \"‎\", \"\" are not counted as separate letters in the alphabet.\"\n\nThere are several areas in which Yiddish orthographic practice varies. One of them is the extent to which pointing is used to avoid ambiguity in the way a word may be read. This ranges from unpointed text, through a small number of pointed characters, to the redundant use of the full system of Hebraic vowel pointing. Text being prepared for print generally uses a certain amount of pointing. In other contexts, however, there is an increasing tendency to forgo it entirely.\n\nThe most frugal application of pointing is the distinction of \"pey\" and \"fey\" by enclosing a dot in the former (further details below). Immediately beyond that is the differentiation of the \"komets alef\" from the unpointed form and then the further use of the \"pasekh alef\". Where additional points are applied, there can be significant variation in their number and disposition and there are often internal inconsistencies in a single system. (The belief that this variation was an impediment to the recognition of Yiddish as a literary peer to the other major European languages was a primary driving force toward the development of orthographic norms.)\n\nA detailed generalized description of the pointing of Yiddish text is given in Harkavy 1898 and the topic is also treated briefly in the SYO (which otherwise simply declares the prescribed characters). A more extensive character repertoire is presented and discussed in Birnbaum 1918.\n\nAlthough consonants are basically represented in the same manner, the indication of vowels differs more widely. One noteworthy situation that does pertain to the representation of consonants is the indication of phonetic distinctions between each of the four character pairs \"beys/veys\", \"kof/khof\", \"pey/fey\", and \"tof/sof\". The 'hard' (plosive) pronunciation of the first letter in each pair is unequivocally denoted by a dot (\"dagesh\") in the middle of the letter. The 'soft' (fricative) pronunciation is similarly notated with a horizontal bar over the letter (\"rafe\"). Most orthographic systems usually only point one of the two characters in a pair but may be inconsistent from pair to pair in indicating the hard or soft alternative. Text that otherwise conforms to the SYO therefore frequently omits the \"rafe\" from \"fey\", in harmonization with its unpointed final form, and makes the contrastive distinction from a \"pey\" solely with a \"dagesh\" in the latter (). The similar avoidance of the \"rafe\" and preferential use of the \"dagesh\" is a common alternative for the contrastive distinction between \"beys\" and \"veys\" (), although in Yiddish, because \"beys\" is used much more than \"veys\", with \"veys\" limited to words of Semitic origin, the \"dagesh\" is avoided and \"rafe\" used instead.\n\nThe \"rafe\" is an attribute of earlier Yiddish orthographic tradition and the \"dagesh\" is an adaptation of what is more generally a Hebrew practice. This also applies to the alternatives for indicating the distinction between \"yud\" when used as a consonant or as a vowel. There is a related need for marking the boundary between a \"yud\" and \"tsvey yudn\" where they appear adjacent to each other and, again, in the corresponding situation with \"vov\" and \"tsvey vovn\". A dot under a \"yud\" (\"khirik yud\") and to the left of a \"vov\" (\"melupm vov\") unambiguously indicates the vocalic form of those letters. Harkavy does not use these pointed forms in the main table above, being among the details codified in the early 20th century. In the traditional Yiddish orthographies where these letters are not pointed, the vowel is indicated by preceding it with a \"shtumer alef\" (reducing the use of which was a major focus of the normative efforts). The single and digraph forms of, for example, \"vov\" can be separated either with a dot or an embedded \"alef\" as or (\"vu\" - \"where\"). Although only the former spelling is consistent with the SYO and appears in Uriel Weinreich's dictionary, he uses the unpointed alternative exclusively in his own \"Say it in Yiddish\" (), a phrase book that contains the word in a large number of \"Where is...?\" queries and was published when the rules had already been well established.\n\nA further graphic example of this distinction is seen in the official announcement, on 14 November 1997, of a change in editorial policy for the prominent Yiddish periodical, (\"forverts\" - \"Yiddish Forward\"). It was first during that year that they adopted the YIVO orthography. The previous editorial position overtly opposed any such change and the following is included in the explanation of the shift (quoted in full in Schaechter 1999, p. 109):\n\nAnd then we removed the \"alef\" in the words [\"yid\"] and [\"yidish\"] (previously and ) and [\"yingl\"] (previously ), and now will spell the words with a \"khirik\" under the second \"yud\" as: ‎, and .\nThe appearance of three alternate spellings for the name of the Yiddish language in a statement intended to describe its orthographic standardization might not require any comment if it were not for the clear indication that the cardinal representation — — was neither the older nor the newer editorial preference. Regardless of the intent of that statement, a word-initial \"yud\" is consonantal and an adjacent \"yud\" is vocalic in all Yiddish orthographic systems, as is the constraint on a word initial \"tsvey yudn\" diphthong. Pointing the second \"yud\" in is therefore, indeed, redundant. The spelling also illustrates some of the dialectic breadth of the Yiddish language, the name of which is both written and pronounced with and without an initial consonant. It may also be useful to note that in earlier texts, a single \"vov\" in word-initial position was often used to indicate .\n\nFinally, letters other than \"shtumer alef\" may be used as silent indications of syllable boundaries and in compound consonants, as well as for extending the length of an adjacent vowel. This became particularly common in deliberately Germanized orthographies dating from the late 19th century, collectively termed \"daytshmerish\". Its most obvious further attributes are the heavy use of double consonants where traditional orthography uses single ones, and the gratuitous substitution of German vocabulary for established Yiddish words. The desire to reverse that trend was another of the reasons for the effort toward orthographic standardization.\n\nPublishers of Yiddish newspapers have, however, been particularly conservative in their attitude toward that development and the preceding editorial statement in \"Forverts\" provides a useful capsule summary of the details about which opinions differed. Other current Yiddish newspapers and magazines retain the spelling and many elements of \"daytshmerish\". This is typified in (\"Der Yid\"), which is one of several weekly tabloids — others being (\"Der Blatt\") and (\"di tsaytung\" - \"News Report\") — that all adhere to the earlier orthography and are in wider circulation and of substantially greater length than the broadsheet \"Forverts\". It may also be seen in the online version of the (\"algemeyner zhurnal\" - Algemeiner Journal), as well as in its printed edition. Extensive additional source material relevant to the stance of the daily press on orthographic reform is provided in Fishman 1981.\n\nEditorial acceptance of varying orthographies is a general characteristic of Hasidic publication, and a single work written by multiple authors may differ in that regard from section to section depending on the preferences of the individual contributors or the typographic context. One example of the latter situation is the use of the pointed forms of \"alef\" only in specific instances where they are deemed necessary to avoid misreading. (As may be noted with the preceding discussion of the spelling of , and the pointing of both \"fey\" and \"pey\", the SYO contains some redundant elements.) The online manifestation of such orthographic heterogeneity can readily be seen in the Yiddish Wikipedia. This is an expansive aspect of contemporary Yiddish publication and will require detailed accommodation in future codifications of orthographic practice.\n\nOrthographic reform as considered here, embraces two distinct actions. The first is concerned with the way Yiddish words are spelled, as illustrated in the preceding section with the name of the language itself. The second relates to the graphic devices used to distinguish, for example, between א when representing what in English is an /a/ and when representing an /o/. The pointed אַ and אָ came into use for that purpose in the mid-18th century and were thus well established by the time the 20th century reforms were initiated, as were several other traditional Yiddish pointings. The most deeply entrenched of these was the distinction between פ \"fey\" and פּ \"pey\". YIVO proposed the additional use of pointed letters that were not in the Yiddish (or Hebrew) fonts of the day. This is a frequently cited reason for the SYO being slow to gain acceptance, but regardless of any opinion about their utility, most of the graphic elements introduced in that manner are now readily available. (The SYO explicitly states that pointing to disambiguate vowels does not change the identity of the base character; a pointed alef, for example, is not a letter of its own.)\n\nThe first edition of the SYO was preceded by a collection of essays published by YIVO in 1930 entitled, \"A Standard of Yiddish Spelling; Discussion No. 1\" (דער איינהייטלעכער יידישער אויסלייג — \"der eynheytlekher yidisher oysleyg\", YIVO 1930). Neither the title of this work, nor its contents, were written using the conventions that YIVO was subsequently to put forward on its basis. The pivotal essay in the 1930 collection was written by Max Weinreich. His, \"A Projected Uniform Yiddish Orthography\" (Weinreich 1930), was not written with the pointing that was to be prescribed in the SYO and introduces a character that was entirely absent from the previous repertoire. This is the V-shaped grapheme on the second line of that text, replacing the \"tsvey vovn\" in Weinreich's name, and in the name of the city where the work was published, Vilna. It appears at numerous additional places in the text and in two other essays in the same collection but did not appear in any subsequent printed work. It was, however, included in the SYO as a recommendation for use in handwritten text, where it is also encountered. Yudl Mark, who authored one of the other 1930 essays in which the typeset form was used, was later to dub this character the \"shpitsik maksl\" (\"acute Maxy\"), and it remains enshrined in the YIVO logotype.\n\nFurther orthographic variation is seen in other YIVO publications from the same period, also using markings that were not included in the SYO, but which did have typographic precedent (for example, אֵ to represent /e/). The way in which the \"pasekh tsvey yudn\" are set in the heading of the Weinreich article (in his name) is discussed below.\n\n\n\n"}
