Although Kivi was among the very earliest authors of prose and lyrics in Finnish, he is still considered one of the greatest.\n\nAleksis Kivi was born in Nurmijärvi, Grand Duchy of Finland, into a tailor's family. In 1846 he left for school in Helsinki, and in 1859 he was accepted into the University of Helsinki, where he studied literature and developed an interest in the theatre. His first play was \"Kullervo\", based on a tragic tale from the \"Kalevala\". He also met the famous journalist and statesman Johan Vilhelm Snellman who became his supporter.\n\nDuring his time at school Kivi read world literature from the library of his landlord, and during his University studies, he saw plays by Molière and Schiller at the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki. Kivi also had friends such as Fredrik Cygnaeus and Elias Lönnrot.\n\nFrom 1863 onwards, Kivi devoted his time to writing. He wrote 12 plays and a collection of poetry. The novel \"Seven Brothers\" or \"The Brothers Seven\"). took him ten years to write. Literary critics, especially the prominent August Ahlqvist, disapproved of the book, at least nominally because of its \"rudeness\" – Romanticism was at its height at the time. Ahlqvist wrote \"It is a ridiculous work and a blot on the name of Finnish literature\" The Fennomans also disapproved of its depiction of not-so-virtuous rural life that was far from their idealized point of view, and Kivi's excessive drinking may have alienated some.\n\nIn 1865 Kivi won the State Prize for his still often performed comedy \"Nummisuutarit\" ('The Cobblers on the Heath', translated as \"Heath Cobblers\" by Douglas Robinson). However, the less than enthusiastic reception of his books was taking its toll and he was already drinking heavily. His main benefactor Charlotta Lönnqvist could not help him after the 1860s.\n\nKivi's health had failed completely in 1870. The collapse was accelerated by typhoid and attacks of delirium and in 1871 he was admitted to the New Clinic, from where he was transferred to the Lapinlahti psychiatric hospital. The doctor treating him, A. T. Saelan, diagnosed him as suffering from melancholia resulting from \"injured dignity as a writer\". On the basis of the available documents, Kalle Achté concludes that it was a classic case of schizophrenia, triggered by severe states of anxiety. It has also been suggested, however, that Kivi's mental illness may have been caused by advanced borreliosis). Kivi died in poverty at the age of 38.\n\nIn the early 20th century young writers Volter Kilpi and Eino Leino raised Kivi to the status of national icon. Eino Leino – and later Väinö Linna and Veijo Meri – also identified with Kivi's fate as an author.\n\nIn 1939 the Aleksis Kivi Memorial, a bronze statue of Kivi by Wäinö Aaltonen, was erected in front of the Finnish National Theatre.\n\nIn 1995 to 1996, Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara wrote an opera about Kivi's life and works. In 2002, director Jari Halonen's film \"The Life of Aleksis Kivi\" (Finnish title: \"\") premiered in Finnish cinemas.\n\n\n"}

It had a lexicon partly based on a dialect of the West African language, perhaps the ancestor of the modern Kalabari language. In contrast to the widely known Negerhollands Dutch creole spoken in the Virgin Islands, Berbice Creole Dutch and its relative Skepi Creole Dutch, were more or less unknown to the outside world until Ian Robertson first reported on the two languages in 1975. Dutch linguist Silvia Kouwenberg subsequently investigated the creole language, publishing its grammar in 1993.\n\nBerbice was settled in 1627 by the Dutchman Abraham van Peere. A few years later, Suriname was settled by Englishmen Lord Willoughby and Lawrence Hyde under a grant from the English King, Charles II. In the beginning, therefore, Suriname was a British and Berbice a Dutch possession.\n\nOn 22 April 1796 the British occupied the territory. On 27 March 1802 Berbice was restored to the Batavian Republic (the then-current name of the Netherlands). In September 1803 the British occupied the territory again. On 13 August 1814 Berbice became a British colony. The colony was formally ceded to Britain by the Netherlands on 20 November 1815.\n\nThe Berbice slaves kept speaking a Dutch-based creole among themselves, until the language came in decay in the 20th century. As of 1993 there were some 4 or 5 elderly speakers of the language, although other sources report tens of speakers.\n\nBerbice Creole Dutch was, as are the also extinct \"Negerhollands\" and Skepi Creole Dutch (with a similar preservation status as Berbice Dutch), not based on Hollandic dialect of Dutch (the dialect that is closest to the modern standard of the Dutch Language Union) but on Zeelandic.\n\nThe last speakers of this language were found in the 1970s by Professor Ian Robertson of the University of the West Indies. These speakers were living on the upper reaches of the Berbice River in and around the area of the Wiruni Creek. The last known Berbice Dutch Creole speaker is Bertha Bell, who was 103 years old when last interviewed by Ian Robertson and a UWI linguistics research team in March 2004.\n\nWhat is remarkable about this language is that it survived on the upper reaches of the Berbice River, the areas around which the old Dutch colony of Berbice was concentrated prior to a shift to the coast in the late 18th century. One-third of the basic words in Berbice Dutch Creole, including words for 'eat', 'know', 'speak' are of Niger–Congo origin in West Africa, from a single language-cluster, the Eastern Ijaw languages.\n\nIn February 2010, the language was declared officially extinct, according to an article in the upcoming March issue of the Dutch edition of \"National Geographic\" magazine. In the 80's there was still a small number of Berbice speakers in Guyana but, since was discovered that the last speaker died in 2005, the authoritative international language database \"Ethnologue\" had declared it extinct.\n\nThere is a large degree of free variation in the vowels, with the range of realizations of the phonemes overlapping.\n\n is usually in complementary distribution with , occurring only before , but there are a handful of exceptions.\n\n\n"}

After working as a scout, he settled among his people in the village of Beaverstown in Indian Territory, where they had been removed. He is credited with establishing the California and Chisholm trails. \n\nAt the beginning of the American Civil War, he guided hundreds of Union troops and their long wagon train from Fort Arbuckle to Kansas to escape much larger Confederate forces; they had to travel more than 500 miles through Indian Territory to reach safety. None of the party or their animals or wagons was lost. Confederates destroyed his ranch, but Black Beaver eventually resettled in Indian Territory after the war, becoming a wealthy rancher in present-day Anadarko, Oklahoma. His former ranch site has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nHe was born in 1806 in present-day Belleville, western Illinois, to the east of St. Louis and across the Mississippi River. Many Lenape had migrated here after the American Revolutionary War from their traditional territory along the Delaware River and coast in the mid-Atlantic states. Black Beaver began trapping and trading beaver pelts as a teenager for the American Fur Company of John Jacob Astor.\n\nKnown to his own people as \"Suck-tum-mah-kway,\" the young man became fluent in English, French, and Spanish, in addition to his native Lenape and about eight other American Indian languages; he used sign language to communicate with tribes whose language he did not know. His skills were invaluable to the many white settlers and military expeditions that were traveling west. He served the Dodge-Leavenworth Expedition of 1834 and, during the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), led a unit of Indian volunteers as a captain in the U.S. Army.\n\nWhen Captain Randolph B. Marcy escorted the first 500 emigrants from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Santa Fe during the gold rush days of 1849, he engaged Black Beaver as his guide. On the way back, Black Beaver, anxious to return home, took a shortcut across the prairie that reduced the two-month trip to two weeks. Thousands of emigrants followed this route to the west; it became known as the California Trail.\n\nAfter that he settled near Fort Arbuckle, in south-central Indian Territory, becoming chief of a Lenape village called Beaverstown. During 1849, 1852 and 1854, Black Beaver guided Randolph B. Marcy's exploration expeditions throughout Texas.\n\nIn his 1859 guide book \"The Prairie Traveler,\" Marcy wrote that Black Beaver\nhad visited nearly every point of interest within the limits of our unsettled territory. He had set his traps and spread his blanket upon the head waters of the Missouri and Columbia; and his wanderings had led him south to the Colorado and Gila, and thence to the shores of the Pacific in Southern California. His life had been that of a veritable cosmopolite, filled with scenes of intense and startling interest, bold and reckless adventure. He was with me two seasons in the capacity of guide, and I always found him perfectly reliable, brave, and competent. His reputation as a resolute, determined, and fearless warrior did not admit of question, yet I have never seen a man who wore his laurels with less vanity. The truth is my friend Beaver was one of those few heroes who never sounded his own trumpet; yet no one that knows him ever presumed to question his courage.\n\nBy 1860 Black Beaver was the wealthiest and most well-known Lenape in America. He had settled in present-day Caddo County, Oklahoma and lived at Anadarko, where the Lenape had been removed from east of the Mississippi.\n\nIn May 1861, with the outbreak of the American Civil War, General William H. Emory, stationed at Fort Arbuckle, learned that 6,000 Confederate troops were advancing toward his forces from Texas and Arkansas. He gathered the soldiers from forts Washita, Cobb and Arbuckle near Minco, but to escape to Kansas across the open prairie he needed a guide. Other Indian guides turned him down for fear of reprisal by the Confederates. In addition, several tribes had allied with the Confederates, who promised them an Indian state if they won the war.\n\nEmory guaranteed Black Beaver that the federal government would reimburse him for any losses, so he agreed to help. He scouted the approaching Confederate troops and provided information for Emory to capture their advance guard, who were the first prisoners captured during the Civil War. Black Beaver guided over 800 Union soldiers, their prisoners, and 200 teamsters managing 80 wagons and 600 horses and mules in a mile-long train across 500 miles of open prairie to safety at Fort Leavenworth in eastern Kansas; he did not lose a single man, horse or wagon. He also freed multiple slaves from each of the 5 civilized tribes.\n\nThe Confederate Army along with the angry tribes destroyed Black Beaver’s ranch and placed a bounty on his head. He stayed in Kansas for the rest of the war. His losses were never fully compensated by the United States government.\n\nAfter the war, Black Beaver and his friend Jesse Chisholm returned and converted part of the Native American path used by the Union Army into what became the Chisholm Trail. They collected and herded thousands of stray Texas longhorn cattle by the Trail to railheads in Kansas, from where the cattle were shipped East, where beef sold for ten times the price in the West. \n\nBlack Beaver resettled at Anadarko, where he built the first brick home in the area. He had 300 acres of fenced and cultivated land as well as cattle, hogs and horses.\n\nBlack Beaver died at his home on May 8, 1880, and was buried on his ranch. In 1976 his grave was moved to Fort Sill. His former ranch site has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, he was the first inductee in the American Indian Hall of Fame in Anadarko, Oklahoma, which is located on part of his former ranch lands.\n\n\n"}

A rule may be applied by replacing an occurrence of the symbols on its left-hand side with those that appear on its right-hand side. A sequence of rule applications is called a \"derivation\". Such a grammar defines the formal language: all words consisting solely of terminal symbols which can be reached by a derivation from the start symbol.\n\nNonterminals are often represented by uppercase letters, terminals by lowercase letters, and the start symbol by . For example, the grammar with terminals , nonterminals , production rules\nand start symbol , defines the language of all words of the form formula_1 (i.e. copies of followed by copies of ).\n\nThe following is a simpler grammar that defines the same language: \nTerminals , Nonterminals , Start symbol , Production rules\n\nAs another example, a grammar for a toy subset of English language is given by:\nand start symbol . An example derivation is\nOther sequences that can be derived from this grammar are: \"\"ideas hate great linguists\", and \"ideas generate\". While these sentences are nonsensical, they are syntactically correct. A syntactically incorrect sentence ( e.g. \"ideas ideas great hate\"\") cannot be derived from this grammar. See \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\" for a similar example given by Chomsky in 1957; see Phrase structure grammar and Phrase structure rules for more natural language examples and the problems of formal grammar in that area.\n\nThe following table summarizes each of Chomsky's four types of grammars, the class of language it generates, the type of automaton that recognizes it, and the form its rules must have.\n\nNote that the set of grammars corresponding to recursive languages is not a member of this hierarchy; these would be properly between Type-0 and Type-1.\n\nEvery regular language is context-free, every context-free language is context-sensitive, every context-sensitive language is recursive and every recursive language is recursively enumerable. These are all proper inclusions, meaning that there exist recursively enumerable languages that are not context-sensitive, context-sensitive languages that are not context-free and context-free languages that are not regular.\n\nType-0 grammars include all formal grammars. They generate exactly all languages that can be recognized by a Turing machine. These languages are also known as the \"recursively enumerable\" or \"Turing-recognizable\" languages. Note that this is different from the recursive languages, which can be \"decided\" by an always-halting Turing machine.\n\nType-1 grammars generate context-sensitive languages. These grammars have rules of the form formula_2 with formula_3 a nonterminal and formula_4, formula_5 and formula_6 strings of terminals and/or nonterminals. The strings formula_4 and formula_5 may be empty, but formula_6 must be nonempty. The rule formula_10 is allowed if formula_11 does not appear on the right side of any rule. The languages described by these grammars are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a linear bounded automaton (a nondeterministic Turing machine whose tape is bounded by a constant times the length of the input.)\n\nType-2 grammars generate the context-free languages. These are defined by rules of the form formula_12 with formula_3 being a nonterminal and formula_6 being a string of terminals and/or nonterminals. These languages are exactly all languages that can be recognized by a non-deterministic pushdown automaton. Context-free languages—or rather its subset of deterministic context-free language—are the theoretical basis for the phrase structure of most programming languages, though their syntax also includes context-sensitive name resolution due to declarations and scope. Often a subset of grammars is used to make parsing easier, such as by an LL parser.\n\nType-3 grammars generate the regular languages. Such a grammar restricts its rules to a single nonterminal on the left-hand side and a right-hand side consisting of a single terminal, possibly followed by a single nonterminal (right regular). Alternatively, the right-hand side of the grammar can consist of a single terminal, possibly preceded by a single nonterminal (left regular). These generate the same languages. However, if left-regular rules and right-regular rules are combined, the language need no longer be regular. The rule formula_10 is also allowed here if formula_11 does not appear on the right side of any rule. These languages are exactly all languages that can be decided by a finite state automaton. Additionally, this family of formal languages can be obtained by regular expressions. Regular languages are commonly used to define search patterns and the lexical structure of programming languages.\n\n"}
{"id": "41518158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41518158", "title": "Derived stem", "text": "Derived stem\n\nDerived stems are a morphological feature of verbs common to the Semitic languages. These derived verb stems are sometimes called augmentations or forms of the verb, or are identified by their Hebrew name binyanim. Semitic languages make extensive use of nonconcatenative morphology, and most words share a set of two, three or four consonants which comprise a root wherein each root may be the basis for a number of conceptually related words. Traditionally, words are thought of as being derived from these root consonants, but a view increasingly held by contemporary linguists sees stem words being the source of derivations rather than consonantal roots. Regardless, each language features a number of set patterns for deriving verb stems from a given root or underived stem. Stems sharing the same root consonants represent separate verbs, albeit often semantically related, and each is the basis for its own conjugational paradigm. As a result, these derived stems are part of the system of derivational morphology, not part of the inflectional system.\n\nTypically, one stem is associated with the ordinary simple active verbs while others may be canonically associated with other grammatical functions such as the passive, the causative, the intensive, the reflexive, etc., or combinations thereof. These functions should not be taken as universal or absolute, but are better understood as relational, depending on the particular source of the derived stem. These grammatical functions are also not present in all Semitic languages, Modern Aramaic, for example has only two stems, one for monosyllabic verbs and the other for disyllabic verbs, with hardly any cases of related verbs in each stem.\n\nFor example, in Arabic and Hebrew, words containing the root √k-t-b have a meaning related to writing (in Hebrew, a phonological process known as begadkefat, alters the quality of certain consonants when they follow a vowel, so \"b\" becomes \"v and\" \"k\" becomes \"ḵ\" (a voiceless velar fricative like German Ba\"ch\"); the symbol ː indicates the preceding consonant is doubled or geminate). Thus:\nThe following two tables show the full paradigm of templates for the nine most common Arabic stems and the seven most common Hebrew stems, and illustrate some of the different meanings and functions that stems can have.\n\nThe first column gives the traditional stem abbreviation used by Comparative Semiticists and the second column gives typical stem names used in Arabic and Hebrew grammars; the Arabic system uses Roman numerals, and the Hebrew uses binyanim forms with the root letters √p-ʕ-l (with \"p\" sometimes becoming \"f\" by begadkefat). The next columns give the canonical functions of each stem, and their templates (the three \"C\"s stand in for the three \"Consonants\" of the root, and \"V\" stands for some \"V\"owel). Finally, the meaning and form of the stems with the √k-t-b root is given in the 3rd person masculine singular perfect, which lacks inflectional affixes.\nThe tD Stem for Arabic is not given for the √k-t-b root because it does not occur, illustrating that not each root has an actual form for each stem; in fact, √k-t-b has a more complete stem paradigm than many other roots.\n\nIn each Semitic language, the number of derived stems is different. In Hebrew there are seven common ones, and in Arabic there are nine common forms and at least six rare ones; Akkadian has thirteen common patterns, Ugaritic has ten, Syriac has six, Modern Aramaic has two, and so on.\n\nThere are different ways of naming stems, most systems classify stems by their morphological patterns but others simply number them. In Arabic, a system using Roman numerals is frequently used, as well as a more traditional system where the forms with the root letters √f-ʕ-l (roughly meaning \"to do\") are used as names of each stem. Hebrew also uses this latter system, although the cognate root used is √p-ʕ-l (with \"p\" sometimes surfacing as \"f\" by begadkefat). In Akkadian, forms with the √p-r-s root \"to decide\" are most often used. The convention using Latin letter abbreviations (such as G, Dt and Š) is a morphological shorthand used most often by comparative Semiticists, and emphasizes the relationships between stems within and between languages. \nThe following table compares some of the important stems of six different Semitic languages: Akkadian, Biblical Hebrew, Syriac, Standard Arabic, Geʿez, and Shehri (aka Jibbali), representing different Semitic subfamilies. By examining these and a few other forms, and using the comparative method and internal reconstruction, the Grammatical Function and Template for the Proto-Semitic derived stems have been reconstructed. The asterisk (*) in the Proto-Semitic Template column indicates that these forms are hypothetical and reconstructed. \n\nBecause the L Stem is only attested in the geographically and genetically proximate Arabic and South Semitic languages, it is thought to be a later innovation, not present in Proto-Semitic. By contrast, since separate but morphologically similar Št and ŠtG Stems are attested in the relatively distantly related Akkadian and Shehri, these are posited to have been different stems in Proto-Semitic, but to have merged in most later Semitic languages.\n\n"}

The term \"Early Modern High German\" is also occasionally used for this period (but the abbreviation EMHG is generally used for \"Early Middle High German\").\n\nThe start and end dates of ENHG are, like all linguistic periodisations, somewhat arbitrary. In spite of many alternative suggestions, Scherer's dates still command widespread acceptance. Linguistically, the mid 14th-century is marked by the phonological changes to the vowel system that characterise the modern standard language; the mid 17th sees the loss of status for regional forms of language, and the triumph of German over Latin as the dominant, and then sole, language for public discourse.\n\nScherer's dates also have the merit of coinciding with two major demographic catastrophes with linguistic consequences: the Black Death, and the end of the Thirty Years' War. Arguably, the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, by ending religious wars and creating a Germany of many small sovereign states, brought about the essential political conditions for the final development of a universally acceptable standard language in the subsequent New High German period.\n\nAlternative periodisations take the period to begin later, such as the invention of printing with moveable type in the 1450s.\n\nThere was no standard Early New High German, and all forms of language display some local or regional characteristics. However, there was increasing harmonisation in the written and printed word, the start of developments towards the unified standard which was codified in the New High German period.\nWith the end of eastward expansion, the geographical spread and the dialect map of German in the ENHG period remained the same as at the close of the MHG period.\n\nSince the printers had a commercial interest in making their texts acceptable to a wide readership, they often strove to avoid purely local forms of language. This gave rise to so-called (\"printers' languages\"), which are not necessarily identical to the spoken dialect of the town where the press was located. The most important centres of printing, with their regional are:\n\nWhile the language of the printers remained regional, the period saw the gradual development of two forms of German (one Upper German, one Central German), which were supra-regional: the (\"written languages\", \"documentary languages\") of the chanceries of the two main political centres. \nThe language of these centres had influence well beyond their own territorial and dialect boundaries. \n\nThe influence of the Saxon Chancery was due in part to its adoption for his own published works by Martin Luther, who stated, \"\" (\"My language is based on that of the Saxon Chancery, which is followed by all the princes and kings in Germany\").\n\nHe also recognized the standardising force of the two chanceries: \"\" (\"The Emperor Maximilian and Duke Frederick, Elector of Saxony etc., have drawn the languages of Germany together\").\n\nMiddle Low German, spoken across the whole of Northern Germany north of the Benrath Line in the Middle Ages, was a distinct West Germanic language. From the start of the 16th century, however, High German came increasingly to be used in this area not only in writing, but also in the pulpit and in schools. By the end of the ENHG period Low German had almost completely ceased to be used in writing or in formal and public speech, and had become the low status variant in a diglossic situation, with High German as the high status variant.\n\nFor a number of reasons it is not possible to give a single phonological system for ENHG:\nAlso, the difficulty of deriving phonological information from the complexity of ENHG orthography means that many reference works do not treat orthography and phonology separately for this period.\n\nThe MHG vowel system undergoes significant changes in the transition to ENHG and their uneven geographical distribution has served to further differentiate the modern dialects.\n\nThe long high vowels , and (spelt , and ) are diphthongised to , and . spelt , and . They thus fall together with the original MHG diphthongs , and , which are all lowered.\n\nExamples:\n\nThis change started as early as the 12th century in Upper Bavarian and only reached Moselle Franconian in the 16th century. It does not affect Alemannic or Ripuarian dialects, which still retain the original long vowels. The map shows the distribution and chronology of this sound change.\n\nThe MHG falling diphthongs , and (spelt , and ) are monophthongised, replacing the long high vowels lost in the diphthongisation. In the case of > the MHG spelling is retained and in Modern German indicates the long vowel.\n\nExamples:\n\nThis change, sometimes called the Central German Monophthongisation, affects mainly the Central German dialects, along with South Franconian and East Franconian. The other Upper German dialects largely retain the original diphthongs.\n\nThere are two changes in vowel quantity in ENHG, the lengthening of short vowels and the shortening of long vowel. Both show wide variation between dialects, but appear earlier and more completely in Central German dialects. Many individual words form exceptions to these changes, though the lengthening is carried out more consistently.\n\n1. Lengthening: MHG short vowels in open syllables (that is, syllables which end in a vowel) tend to be lengthened in the ENHG period. This is not reflected directly in spelling, but it is the source of the Modern German spelling convention that a vowel ending a syllable is always long.\n\nExamples:\n\n2. Shortening: MHG long vowels tend to be shortened in the ENHG period before certain consonants (, and others) and before certainconsonant combinations (, , and , , , followed by another consonant).\n\nExamples:\nThis shortening seems to have taken place later than the monophthongisation, since the long vowels which result from that change are often shortened.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe overall consonant system of German remains largely unchanged in the transition from MHG to Modern German. However, in many cases sounds changed in particular environments and therefore changed in distribution. Some of the more significant are the following.

Both of these were significant contributors to the development of the Modern German Standard language, as they further promoted the development of non-local forms of language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own area — even the illiterate, who were read \"to\". The most important single text of the period was Luther's Bible translation, the first part of which was published in 1522, though this is now not credited with the central role in creating the standard that was once attributed to it. This is also the first period in which prose works, both literary and discursive, became more numerous and more important than verse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was the wife of the Dutch writer Louis Couperus (1863–1923).\n\nCouperus-Baud was the daughter of Jan Carel Willem Ricus Theodore Baud (1838–1883), an assistant resident at Meester Cornelis (Dutch East Indies) and his cousin Johanna Wilhelmina Petronella Steenstra Toussaint (1844–1927). In 1890 she published, in the Dutch magazine \"Nederland\", a short story called \"Een galavoorstelling\". She married in 1891 her cousin, Louis Couperus, son of John Ricus Couperus (1816–1902) and jkvr. Catharina Geertruida Reynst (1829–1893). Louis Couperus wrote about Elisabeth Couperus-Baud in his novel \"De zwaluwen neergestreken\": \"We are cousins and played together as children. We still own photographs of ourselves together, when we were young.\" In 1893 Louis Couperus received a letter from Oscar Wilde, in which he was complemented with his novel \"Noodlot\"; this book was translated into English by Clara Bell.\n\nAs a result of the correspondence Elisabeth Couperus-Baud was asked to translate Wilde's book \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". After her marriage to Louis Couperus, Couperus-Baud was active as a critic of her husband's work and made readable copies of his handwritings.\nIn time Couperus-Baud made numerous translations; she translated French, German, English, Spanish and Italian manuscripts. To her publisher, L.J. Veen, she wrote: everything you want (\"Comme vous voulez\"). In 1899 she wrote the first of what had to become a series of travel letters in the Dutch magazine \"Hollandia\", however only one letter was published. From 1915 onwards, when she and her husband had returned from their stay abroad, Couperus-Baud edited manuscripts and changed them into plays that could be performed on stage.\n\nAfter the death of Louis Couperus the \"Louis Couperus Genootschap\" was founded in 1928 (in Hilversum). Chairman of the foundation was writer Henri van Booven, while Elisabeth Couperus-Baud was appointed chairman of honor. After the death of her husband she took his place as a member of the board of directors of the Dutch magazine \"Groot Nederland\". She died as a poor widow in a pension in The Hague, owned by Mrs. Stracker and Mrs. Teillers and her ashes were buried at the cemetery Oud Eik en Duinen in The Hague.\n\nFrom October 2001 – April 2002 an exhibition about Elisabeth Couperus-Baud was held in and organized by the Louis Couperus Museum. Special attention was paid to Couperus-Bauds marriage with a suspected gay husband and her way of dealing with this. In 2007 a novel, written by Sophie Zijlstra, called \"Mevrouw Couperus\", was published. Dutch writer Gerard Reve wrote about her: \"She had to endure quite a lot\" (in a lecture he held called \"Het geheim van Louis Couperus\" (The secret of Louis Couperus)) and Frédéric Bastet, biographer of Couperus, said: \"Zij kwam veel tekort\" (she could not live life to the fullest).\n\n\n\n"}

It was expected that horse sellers would capitalize on these opportunities and so those who dealt in horses gained a reputation for underhanded business practices.\n\nAs standards for ethical business declined in the United States in the Gilded Age, the activities of horse traders came increasingly to be seen as the natural and, in part, desirable product of a competitive market rather than as symptoms of moral depravity. In an 1893 \"New York Times\" editorial criticizing a proposed law to make it illegal for a newspaper to falsely state its circulation figures, the author declared that \"if the lying were stopped by law, the business of horse trading would come to an end, and the country taverns and groceries in the Winter season would be deprived even of the limited eventfulness which they now enjoy\".\n\nReflecting this attitude, the term \"horse trading\" was widely adopted as a way to describe what might be seen as unethical business practices in a more positive light. It is likely the 1898 publication of Edward Noyes Westcott's \"David Harum\" – whose title character saw all business through the lens of horse trading – played a key role in this.\n\nIn a further development of meaning, \"horse trading\" has come to refer specifically to political vote trading. This is now the most common sense of the term, largely displacing the older term, logrolling.\n\nIn some languages political bargaining is known as \"cow trading\" (, , ). In Sweden, the May 1933 agreement between the Swedish Social Democratic Party and the Swedish Farmers' League is called that.\n"}

Edwards\n\nHuw Thomas Edwards (19 November 1892 – 8 November 1970) was a Welsh trade union leader and politician.\n\nEdwards was born in Rowen near the top of Tal-y-fan Mountain, North Wales. He was the youngest of seven children, all of whom could speak only Welsh. Edwards' father was a quarryman who grew up with no education, being taught how to read and write by Edward's mother. She died when Edwards was eight, after a period of poor health. After her death, the family moved and Edwards' father remarried within a year. From the age of ten, Edwards went to the quarry at Penmaenmawr with his father, at least during his holidays from school. He soon began to start working on a farm in Talybont near Bangor, where one of his brothers also worked.\n\nEven before he was eighteen, Edwards left for Tonypandy in the South Wales coalfields. He travelled by rail, via Chester, and became aware of the urban, English, middle-class world outside of North Wales. When he arrived in Trealaw, he found lodgings and a job as a dustman on the night shift at Clydach Vale No. 2 Pit in the Rhondda mines. Working at the mines, Edwards became familiar with various English-speaking migrants, and quickly picked up the language. Before Edwards arrived in the area, his cousin had been one of ten people killed in an explosion at Clydach Vale. Another cousin, with whom Edwards had become close friends, was killed in the Senghenydd colliery disaster: Edwards was a member of one of the rescue parties that recovered bodies, following the explosion. \nEdwards joined the South Wales Miners' Federation (known as the Fed), but did not always involve himself with strike action.\n\nEdwards went away to fight in August 1914, at the age of twenty-one. He returned from the Western Front in March 1918, severely wounded and made to spend months in hospital. In September 1918, he was discharged and spent the last weeks of the war teaching gas drill to new recruits. After returning to civilian life on 10 December 1918, he stayed in Aberfan for a week, before returning to Penmaenmawr quarry. He joined the Workers' Union and the Independent Labour Party. After representing the quarry workers in a case of pay, Edwards joined the Dockers' Union in around 1920, leaving the Amalgamated Union of Quarryworkers and Steelworkers, which represented most quarry workers. Edwards was dismissed from his job at the quarry, due to refusing to rejoin the quarryworkers' union after strike action.\n\nIn 1923, Edwards became secretary of the Penmaenmawr branch of the Transport and General Workers' Union, which allowed him to meet with other union leaders. In 1927, he was elected to Penmaenmawr council.\n\nHe was appointed the first chair of the Council for Wales and Monmouthshire in 1949. He was in favour of a Welsh Parliament but initially did not support the Parliament for Wales campaign in the early 1950s although later he did join the campaign. He opposed the decision to flood the Tryweryn valley to create a reservoir to service Liverpool. In 1956 he bought the Welsh-language periodical, \"Y Faner\", in order to save it from liquidation. In 1958 he resigned from the Council for Wales and in 1959 he left the Labour Party to join Plaid Cymru although he returned to the Labour fold in 1965. He was the first President of the Welsh Language Society.\n\nHe published two autobiographical volumes in his native Welsh, \"Tros y Tresi\" (1956) and \"Troi'r Drol\" (1963). He was also a poet.\n\nIn March 1920, Edwards married Margaret Owen, a Welsh-speaking woman from Rachub, Bethesda, Gwynedd. They had known each other since Edwards was a boy, as she was his sister's best friend.\n"}
{"id": "59347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59347", "title": "Hyphen", "text": "Hyphen\n\nThe hyphen (‐) is a punctuation mark used to join words and to separate syllables of a single word. The use of hyphens is called hyphenation. Non-hyphenated is an example of a hyphenated word. The hyphen should not be confused with dashes (‒, –, —, ―), which are longer and have different uses, or with the minus sign (−), which is also longer in some contexts.\n\nAs an orthographic concept, the hyphen is a single entity. In terms of character encoding and display, that entity is represented by any of several characters and glyphs (including hard hyphens, soft or optional hyphens, and nonbreaking hyphens), depending on the context of use (discussed below).\n\nAlthough hyphens are not to be confused with en dashes and minus signs, there are some overlaps in usage (in which either a hyphen or an en dash may be acceptable, depending on user preference; discussed below) and in character encoding (which often uses the same character, called a \"hyphen-minus\", to represent both the hyphen and minus sign entities; discussed below).\n\nThe term derives from Ancient Greek (\"hyph’ hén\"), contracted from (\"hypó hén\"), \"in one\" (literally \"under one\").\n\nThe term ((\"he\") \"hyphén\"), was used for a tie-like (‿) sign written below two consecutive letters to indicate that they belong to the same word (when it was necessary to avoid ambiguity before the space was in regular use).\n\nThe English language does not have definitive hyphenation rules, though various style guides provide detailed usage recommendations, and have a significant amount of overlap in what they advise. Hyphens are mostly used to break single words into parts, or to join ordinarily separate words into single words. Spaces are not placed between a hyphen and either of the elements it connects except when using a suspended or \"hanging\" hyphen that stands in for a repeated word (e.g., \"nineteenth- and writers\"). Style conventions that apply to hyphens (and dashes) have evolved to support ease of reading in complex constructions; editors often accept deviations if they aid rather than hinder easy comprehension.\n\nThe use of the hyphen in English compound nouns and verbs has, in general, been steadily declining. Compounds that might once have been hyphenated are increasingly left with spaces or are combined into one word. Reflecting this changing usage, in 2007, the sixth edition of the \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" removed the hyphens from 16,000 entries, such as \"fig-leaf\" (now \"fig leaf\"), \"pot-belly\" (now \"pot belly\") and \"pigeon-hole\" (now \"pigeonhole\"). The increasing prevalence of computer technology and the advent of the Internet have given rise to a subset of common nouns that might have been hyphenated in the past (e.g. \"toolbar\", \"hyperlink\", \"pastebin\").\n\nDespite decreased use, hyphenation remains the norm in certain compound-modifier constructions and, among some authors, with certain prefixes (see below). Hyphenation is also routinely used as part of syllabification in justified texts to avoid unsightly spacing (especially in columns with narrow measure, as when used with newspapers).\n\nWhen flowing text, it is sometimes preferable to break a word in half so that it continues on another line rather than moving the entire word to the next line. The word may be divided at the nearest break point between syllables (syllabification), and a hyphen inserted to indicate that the letters form a word fragment, rather than a full word. This allows more efficient use of paper, allows flush appearance of right-side margins (justification) without oddly large word spaces, and decreases the problem of rivers. This kind of hyphenation is most useful when the width of the column (called the measure in typography) is very narrow. For example:\n\nThe details of doing this properly are complex and language-dependent, and can interact with other orthographic and typesetting practices. Hyphenation algorithms, when employed in concert with dictionaries, are sufficient for all but the most formal texts. See also justification.\n\nIt may be necessary to distinguish an incidental line-break hyphen from one integral to a word being mentioned (as when used in a dictionary) or present in an original text being quoted (when in a critical edition)—not only to control its word wrap behavior (which encoding handles with hard and soft hyphens having the same glyph) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph). \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\" and the \"Chambers Dictionary\" use a double hyphen for integral hyphens and a single hyphen for line-breaks, whereas Kromhout's Afrikaans–English dictionary uses the opposite convention. The \"Concise Oxford Dictionary (fifth edition)\" repeated an integral hyphen at the start of the following line.\n\nPrefixes (such as \"de-\", \"pre-\", \"re-\", and \"non-\") and suffixes (such as ', ', ', and ') may or may not be hyphenated. (The unhyphenated style is also called \"closed up\" or \"solid\".) A rule of thumb is that they are not hyphenated unless the lack of a hyphen hurts clarity—specifically, clarity at first glance rather than clarity upon a second look or a moment's pause. The clear–unclear distinction involves some subjectivity, because what is instantly clear to one reader may not be to another (depending on, for example, subject matter familiarity). Nonetheless, consensus among users of a language often reduces that subjectivity for many words. This is explained further below.\n\nMany long-established words, such as \"disgusted\", \"degrade\", and \"refresh\", do not require a hyphen because they are fully fused to the point that their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function. Many other words, such as \"prewashed\" or \"repainted\", may not be \"quite\" so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness), but nonetheless they require no hyphen, because (1) most readers recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus have no trouble parsing the syllables, and (2) if all such words were hyphenated, the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous.\n\nIn contrast, for some other words, the closed-up style may not be as clear, and the hyphen can ensure clarity and avoid awkwardness, including odd appearance or misguided parsing of syllables. An example of avoiding misguided parsing would be to hyphenate the word \"\" (versus \"coworker\") to prevent the reader's eye being caught automatically by the letter group \"cow\" (which might suggest \"cow\" () before backtracking and reparsing occurred). In such cases, styling varies depending on individual preference, regional preference, occupational specialty, or style guide preference, because the definition of awkwardness for any given word depends on who is judging it.\n\nWords for which prefix hyphenation is least subjective, to the point that closed-up style is widely rejected, are of several classes. One such class consists of a few words that require a hyphen to distinguish them from other words that would otherwise be homographs, such as \"recreation\" (fun or sport) versus ' (the act of creating again), \"retreat\" (turn back) versus ' (give therapy again), and ' (not in ion form) versus \"unionized\" (organized into trade unions). The other classes are those in which the prefix is applied to (1) a proper (capitalized) noun or adjective (', '); (2) an acronym (', '); or (3) a number (', \"\").\n\nStyle guides codify rules to minimize inconsistency, the ultimate goal of which is to have the style unnoticed by the reader (that is, to avoid catching the reader's eye, either with trivial differences or with a lot of superfluous hyphens). The style guide rules allow exceptions to avoid awkwardness. For example, a guide will typically say to follow dictionary X's style for any word entered therein, and for words not entered, to close up by default and thus hyphenate only to avoid awkwardness. Such a rule successfully codifies almost all choices and thus leaves little to discretion except a few rare or neologistic words, which are safely hyphenated. This ensures high intradocument and interdocument consistency. Rules about avoiding doubled vowels or doubled consonants are often mentioned in style guides. These appropriately cascade only downstream, not upstream, of the \"follow dictionary X\" rule, because most dictionaries close up many well-established doubled-letter pairs. (For example, any style that follows \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\" thus closes up \"preempt\", \"reexamine\", \"deemphasize\", \"nonnegotiable\", \"posttransfusion\", and hundreds of others.) As mentioned earlier, the definition of \"awkwardness\" for any given word is inherently subjective but nonetheless also subject to consensus. For example, \"reexamine\" and \"deemphasize\" are accepted as nonawkward by a broad consensus; to \"prefer\" the hyphenated styling is a matter of opinion, but to \"insist\" that the solid styling is awkward would be considered pedantic by many educated readers. However, some doublings attract smaller majorities than others in such a consensus; with the '/\"coworker\" example (mentioned earlier) or with \"antiinflammatory\"/', many readers may consider solid styling nonawkward whereas plenty of others don't, and in such cases, dictionary styles may vary (\"Dorland's\", \"antiinflammatory\"; \"Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary\", '). Tripled letters rarely occur, but when they do, the hyphen is considered mandatory (thus ', not \"shelllike\").\n\nThere is a trend that over decades, words that once were hyphenated for clarity lose the hyphen as their familiarity grows. An excellent example is \"email\"/'; the number of people who find \"email\" awkward dropped from the 1990s to the 2010s, and thus the hyphen has been dropped increasingly. For some instances, the consensus depends on occupational specialty or subspecialty. Although ' is still hyphenated by most users (and by both \"Dorland's\" and \"Merriam-Webster's Medical\"), the solid styling (\"protooncogene\") is gaining popularity, with oncologists and geneticists (for whom the term is most familiar) leading the way.\n\nA hyphen can clarify that two adjacent vowels—whether two of the same letter (e.g., \"oo\", \"ee\") or two different letters (e.g., \"ae\", \"ei\")—are pronounced separately rather than being merged in a diphthong. The question is how necessary the clarification is. Thus, hyphenated ' and ' have plenty of support, consensus-wise (plenty of users consider their hyphens as not superfluous), although solid \"deescalate\" and \"cooperation\" have plenty of support as well (plenty of users consider the hyphens superfluous). Consensus for styling varies by class, subclass, and even by individual word, with the common theme being that internal punctuation drops out of any combination judged as instantly recognizable enough in its context not to need it. As classes, there are doubling (namely, \"aa, ee, ii, oo, uu, yy\") and nondoubling (for example, \"a+e, a+i, a+o; e+e, e+i, e+o\"). Several subclasses exist. There are combinations that are not rare in English as diphthongs and also not rare as nondiphthongs for users willing to style prefixed words solidly (such as \"ee\" and \"ei\"); regarding \"de+e/re+e/pre+e\" and \"de+i/re+i/pre+i\", nearly everyone agrees that some fully fused examples (such as \"reiterate\" and \"reinforce\") need no hyphen, but other examples have more evenly split pluralities (such as \"reexamine\"/' or \"deemphasize\"/'). There are combinations that are rare in English as diphthongs (for example, \"aa\" and \"ii\") but not rare in prefixed words for those willing to style them solidly; and thus either they hardly need clarification within prefixed words (the solidification argument; thus \"intraarterial\" and \"antiinflammatory\") or they need a hyphen to avoid looking like rare diphthongs, which are \"odd-looking\" because rare (the hyphenation argument, thus ' and ').\n\nA diaeresis can also sometimes be used, either to indicate nondiphthong status (e.g., \"coöperation\" and \"naïve\") or to indicate non-silent terminal -e (e.g., \"Brontë\"), but there are several implicit boundaries on this style's use; it is now rare (its peak of popularity was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries), and it was never applied extensively across the language (only a handful of examples, including \"coöperation\", \"naïve\", and \"Brontë\", are encountered with any appreciable frequency in English; for whatever reason, it never had any popularity in the \"de+e/re+e/pre+e\" or \"de+i/re+i/pre+i\" subclasses—thus never \"*reëxamine\", \"*reïterate\", \"*deëmphasize\", or others, although they might have been useful). Many users (and various dictionaries) consider the diaeresis optional in \"naive\"/\"naïve\" (because not necessary for the reader to recognize the word), and \"*na-ive\" draws attention to itself as a style that is simply never used (although comprehensible). For \"deity\" and \"deify\", only solid styling (no hyphen or diaeresis) is normative.\n\nHyphens are occasionally used to denote syllabification, as in \"syl-la-bi-fi-ca-tion\". Various British and North American dictionaries use an interpunct, sometimes called a \"middle dot\" or \"hyphenation point\", for this purpose, as in \"syl·la·bi·fi·ca·tion\". This allows the hyphen to be reserved only for places where a hard hyphen is intended (for example, ', ', \"\"). Similarly, hyphens may be used to indicate a word is being or should be spelled. For example, \"W-O-R-D spells \"word\"\".\n\nCompound modifiers are groups of two or more words that jointly modify the meaning of another word. When a compound modifier other than an adverb–adjective combination appears \"before\" a term, the compound modifier is often hyphenated to prevent misunderstanding, such as in \" player\" or \" paintings\". Without the hyphen, there is potential confusion about whether the writer means a \"player of American football\" or an \"American player of football\" and whether the writer means paintings that are \"little celebrated\" or \"celebrated paintings\" that are little. Compound modifiers can extend to three or more words, as in \" candy\", and can be adverbial as well as adjectival (\" frightening\"). However, if the compound is a familiar one, it is usually unhyphenated. For example, at least one style guide prefers the construction \"high school students\", to \" students\". Although the expression is technically ambiguous (\"students of a high school\"/\"school students who are high\"), it would normally be formulated differently if other than the first meaning were intended. Noun–noun compound modifiers may also be written without a hyphen when no confusion is likely: \"grade point average\" and \"department store manager\".\n\nWhen a compound modifier \"follows\" the term to which it applies, a hyphen is typically not used if the compound is a temporary compound. For example, \"that gentleman is well respected\", not \"that gentleman is well-respected\"; or \"a patient-centered approach was used\" but \"the approach was patient centered.\" But permanent compounds, found as headwords in dictionaries, are treated as invariable, so if they are hyphenated in the cited dictionary, the hyphenation will be used in both attributive and predicative positions. For example, \"A cost-effective method was used\" and \"The method was cost-effective\" (\"cost-effective\" is a permanent compound that is hyphenated as a headword in various dictionaries). When one of the parts of the modifier is a proper noun or a proper adjective, there is no hyphen (e.g., \"a South American actor\").\n\nWhen the first modifier in a compound is an adverb ending in \"-ly\" (e.g., \"a poorly written novel\"), various style guides advise no hyphen. However, some do allow for this use. For example, \"The Economist Style Guide\" advises: \"Adverbs do not need to be linked to participles or adjectives by hyphens in simple constructions ... Less common adverbs, including all those that end \"-ly\", are less likely to need hyphens\".\nIn the 19th century, it was common to hyphenate adverb–adjective modifiers with the adverb ending in \"-ly\" (e.g., \"a craftily-constructed chair\"). However, this has become rare. For example, \"wholly owned subsidiary\" and \"quickly moving vehicle\" are unambiguous, because the adverbs clearly modify the adjectives: \"quickly\" cannot modify \"vehicle\".\n\nHowever, if an adverb can also function as an adjective, then a hyphen may be or should be used for clarity, depending on the style guide. For example, the phrase \" reasons\" (\"reasons that are more important\") is distinguished from \"more important reasons\" (\"additional important reasons\"), where \"more\" is an adjective. Similarly, \" scenery\" (with a mass-noun) is distinct from \"more beautiful scenery\". (In contrast, the hyphen in \"a reason\" is not necessary, because the syntax cannot be misinterpreted.) A few short and common words – such as \"well\", \"ill\", \"little\", and \"much\" – attract special attention in this category. The hyphen in \"well-[past_participled] noun\", such as in \"well-differentiated cells\", might reasonably be judged superfluous (the syntax is unlikely to be misinterpreted), yet plenty of style guides call for it. Because \"early\" has both adverbial and adjectival senses, its hyphenation can attract attention; some editors, due to comparison with \"advanced-stage disease\" and \"adult-onset disease\", like the parallelism of \"early-stage disease\" and \"early-onset disease\". Similarly, the hyphen in \"little-celebrated paintings\" clarifies that one is not speaking of little paintings.\n\nHyphens are usually used to connect numbers and words in modifying phrases. Such is the case when used to describe dimensional measurements of weight, size, and time, under the rationale that, like other compound modifiers, they take hyphens in attributive position (before the modified noun), although not in predicative position (after the modified noun). This is applied whether numerals or words are used for the numbers. Thus \" woman\" and \" woman\" or \" wingspan\" and \" wingspan\", but \"the woman is 28 years old\" and \"a wingspan of 32 feet\". However, with symbols for SI units (such as \"m\" or \"kg\")—as opposed to the \"names\" of these units (such as \"metre\" or \"kilogram\")—both the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology recommend use without a hyphen: \"a 25 kg sphere\". When the units are spelled out, this recommendation does not apply: \"a sphere\", \"a roll of film\".\n\nIn spelled-out fractions, hyphens are usually used when the fraction is used as an adjective but not when it is used as a noun: thus \" majority\" and \" portion\" but \"I drank two thirds of the bottle\" or \"I kept three quarters of it for myself\". However, at least one major style guide hyphenates spelled-out fractions invariably (whether adjective or noun).\n\nIn English, an en dash ( – ) sometimes replaces the hyphen in hyphenated compounds if either of its constituent parts is already hyphenated or contains a space (for example, \"San Francisco–area residents\", \"hormone receptor–positive cells\", \"cell cycle–related factors\", and \"public-school–private-school rivalries\"). A commonly used alternative style is the hyphenated string (\"hormone-receptor-positive cells\", \"cell-cycle-related factors\"). (For other aspects of en dash–versus–hyphen use, see \"Dash > En dash\".)\n\nWhen an object is compounded with a verbal noun, such as \"egg-beater\" (a tool that beats eggs), the result is sometimes hyphenated. Some authors do this consistently, others only for disambiguation; in this case, \"egg-beater, egg beater,\" and \"eggbeater\" are all common.\n\nAn example of an ambiguous phrase appears in \"they stood near a group of alien lovers\", which without a hyphen implies that they stood near a group of lovers who were aliens; \"they stood near a group of alien-lovers\" clarifies that they stood near a group of people who loved aliens, as \"alien\" can be either an adjective or a noun. On the other hand, in the phrase \"a hungry pizza-lover\", the hyphen will often be omitted (a hungry pizza lover), as \"pizza\" cannot be an adjective and the phrase is therefore unambiguous.\n\nSimilarly, \"there's a man-eating shark in these waters\" is nearly the opposite of \"there's a man eating shark at table 6\"; the first is a shark, and the second a man. \"A government-monitoring program\" is a program that monitors the government, whereas \"a government monitoring program\" is a government program that monitors something else.\n\nSome married couples compose a new surname (sometimes referred to as a double-barrelled name) for their new family by combining their two surnames with a hyphen. Jane Doe and John Smith might become Jane and John Smith-Doe, or Doe-Smith, for instance. In some countries only the woman hyphenates her birth surname, appending her husband's surname. (See also Spanish naming customs#Hyphenation and Portuguese name#Hyphenation.) \n\nWith already-hyphenated names, some parts are typically dropped. For example, Aaron Johnson and Samantha Taylor-Wood became Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Sam Taylor-Johnson. Not all hyphenated surnames are the result of marriage. For example Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a descendant of Louis Lemlé Dreyfus whose son was Léopold Louis-Dreyfus.\n\nConnecting hyphens are used in a large number of miscellaneous compounds, other than modifiers, such as in \"lily-of-the-valley\", \"cock-a-hoop\", \"clever-clever\", \"tittle-tattle\" and \"orang-utan\". Use is often dictated by convention rather than fixed rules, and hyphenation styles may vary between authors; for example, \"orang-utan\" is also written as \"orangutan\" or \"orang utan\", and \"lily-of-the-valley\" may be hyphenated or not.\n\nA suspended hyphen (also called a \"suspensive hyphen\" or \"hanging hyphen\", or less commonly a \"dangling\" or \"floating\" hyphen) may be used when a single base word is used with separate, consecutive, hyphenated words which are connected by \"and\", \"or\", or \"to\". For example, \"nineteenth-century and twentieth-century\" may be written as \"nineteenth- and twentieth-century.\" This usage is now common in English and specifically recommended in some style guides. Although less common, suspended hyphens are also used in English when the base word comes first, such as in \"investor-owned and \". Uses such as \"applied and sociolinguistics\" (instead of \"applied linguistics and sociolinguistics\") are frowned upon in English; the Indiana University Style Guide uses this example and says \"Do not 'take a shortcut' when the first expression is ordinarily open\" (i.e., ordinarily two separate words). This is different, however, from instances where prefixes that are normally closed up (styled solidly) are used suspensively. For example, ' becomes ' (not \"\") when suspended. Some editors prefer to avoid suspending such pairs, choosing instead to write out both words in full.\n\nA hyphen may be used to connect groups of numbers, such as in dates (see below), telephone numbers or sports scores. It can also be used to indicate a range of values, although many styles prefer an en dash (see examples at Dash > En dash > Ranges of values).\n\nThe hyphen is sometimes used to hide letters in words (filleting for redaction/censoring), as in G-d, although an en dash can be used as well (\"G–d\").\n\nThe hyphen is often used in reduplicatives.\n\nSome stark examples of semantic changes caused by the placement of hyphens:\n\n\nThe first known documentation of the hyphen is in the grammatical works of Dionysius Thrax. At the time hyphenation was joining two words that would otherwise be read separately by a low tie mark between the two words. In Greek these marks were known as \"enotikon\", officially romanized as a hyphen.\n\nWith the introduction of letter-spacing in the Middle Ages, the hyphen, still written beneath the text, reversed its meaning. Scribes used the mark to connect two words that had been incorrectly separated by a space. This era also saw the introduction of the marginal hyphen, for words broken across lines.\n\nThe modern format of the hyphen originated with Johannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany, with the publication of his 42-line Bible. His tools did not allow for a subliminal hyphen, and he thus moved it to the middle of the line. Examination of an original copy on vellum (Hubay index #35) in the U. S. Library of Congress shows that Gutenberg's movable type was set justified in a uniform style, 42 equal lines per page. The Gutenberg printing press required words made up of individual letters of type to be held in place by a surrounding non-printing rigid frame. Gutenberg solved the problem of making each line the same length to fit the frame by inserting a hyphen as the last element at the right-side margin. This interrupted the letters in the last word, requiring the remaining letters be carried over to the start of the line below. His hyphen appears throughout the Bible as a short, double line inclined to the right at a 60-degree angle.\n\nIn the ASCII character encoding, the hyphen is encoded as character 45. This character is sometimes called the hyphen-minus, as it is also used as the minus sign and even sometimes for dashes. In Unicode, the hyphen-minus is encoded as (-) so that Unicode remains compatible with ASCII. However, Unicode also encodes the hyphen and minus separately, as U+2010 (‐) and U+2212 (−) respectively, along with the em dash U+2014 (—), en dash U+2013 (–) and other related characters. On Android, the Unicode hyphen and the hyphen-minus are similar but not identical (compare:‐-). The hyphen-minus is a general-purpose character that attempts to fulfill several roles, and wherever optimal typography is desired, the preferred hyphen, minus, or other symbol should be used instead. For example, compare 4+3−2=5 (minus) and 4+3-2=5 (hyphen-minus); in most fonts the hyphen-minus will not have the optimal width, thickness, or vertical position, whereas the minus character will.\n\nHowever, the Unicode hyphen is awkward to enter on most keyboards, so the hyphen-minus character remains very common. They are often used instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ASCII-only text), where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via dialog boxes or multi-key, unmemorable keyboard shortcuts), or when the writer is unaware of the distinction. Some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to represent a dash in ASCII text.\n\nThe ASCII hyphen-minus character is also often used when specifying command-line options. The character is usually followed by one or more letters that indicate specific actions. Typically it is called a dash or switch in this context. Various implementations of the getopt function to parse command-line options additionally allow the use of two hyphen-minus characters ( -- ) to specify long option names that are more descriptive than their single-letter equivalents. Another use of hyphens is that employed by programs written with pipelining in mind: a single hyphen may be recognized in lieu of a filename, with the hyphen then serving as an indicator that a standard stream, instead of a file, is to be worked with.\n\nAlthough software (hyphenation algorithms) can often automatically make decisions on when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user to be able to insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a soft hyphen (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is \"allowed\" but not \"forced\". That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.\n\nIn contrast, a hyphen that is always displayed and printed is called a hard hyphen (although some use this term to refer to a non-breaking hyphen; see below). Soft hyphens are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation \"may\" occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the soft hyphens by hand, and tools using hyphenation algorithms are available that do this automatically. Current modules of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries.\n\nAlso nonbreaking hyphen, non-breaking hyphen and no-break hyphen. This character looks identical to the regular hyphen, but it is treated as a letter by word processors, namely that the hyphenated word will not be divided at the hyphen should this fall at what would be the end of a line of text; instead, the whole hyphenated word either will remain in full at the end of the line or will go in full to the beginning of the next line. The non-breaking space exists for similar reasons.\n\nThe word segmentation rules of most text systems consider a hyphen to be a word boundary and a valid point at which to break a line when flowing text. However, this is not always desirable behavior, especially when it could lead to ambiguity (such as in the examples given before, where \"recreation\" and \"re‑creation\" would be indistinguishable), or in languages other than English (e.g., a line break at the hyphen in Irish or Romanian would be undesirable). In Unicode it is defined as .\n\nIn parts of Europe, the hyphen is used to delineate parts within a written date. Germans and Slavs also used Roman numerals for the month; \"14‑VII‑1789\" (14 July 1789), for example, is one way of writing the first Bastille Day, though this usage is rapidly falling out of favour. Plaques on the wall of the Moscow Kremlin are written this way. Use of hyphens, as opposed to the slashes used in the English language, is specified for international standards.\n\nInternational standard ISO 8601, which was accepted as European Standard EN 28601 and incorporated into various typographic style guides (e.g., DIN 5008 in Germany), brought about a new standard using the hyphen. Now all official European governmental documents use this. These norms prescribe writing dates using hyphens: 1789-07-14 is the new way of writing the first Bastille Day. This is also the typical date format used in large parts of Eastern Europe and Asia, although sometimes with other separators than the hyphen.\n\nThis method has gained influence within North America, as most common computer filesystems make the use of slashes difficult or impossible. DOS, OS/2 and Windows simultaneously support both \\ and / as directory separators, but / is also used to introduce and separate switches to shell commands (unless reconfigured to use the hyphen-minus in DOS). Unix-like systems use / as a directory separator and, while \\ is legal in filenames, it is awkward to use as the shell uses it as an escape character. Unix also uses a space followed by a hyphen to introduce switches. Apart from the separator used the non-year form of the date format is also identical to the standard American representation.\n\nApart from dash and minus sign, Unicode has multiple hyphen characters:\n\nNote: The serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after word wrapping at the end of a line.\n\nAnd in non-Latin scripts:\n\nUnicode distinguishes the hyphen from the general interpunct. The characters below do not have the Unicode property of \"Hyphen\" despite their names:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31055101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31055101", "title": "Kukna language", "text": "Kukna language\n\nKukna is a minority language spoken by the Saraswat Konkani people of Karnataka and in some parts of Kerala.\n\nThe Karnataka Saraswat dialects are referred to as Canara Konkani. The Kerala dialects are referred to as Travancore Konkani or Kerala Konkani. Certain dialects like the Canara Saraswat dialects of the Gaud Saraswats and Bhanaps are called आमचीगॆलॆं \"āmcigelẽ\" (lit. ours) and the dialect of the Cochin Gaud Saraswats is called कॊच्चिमांय \"koccimā̃y\" (lit. mother Cochin) by the members of those communities.\n\nThe word \"Canara\" is a Portuguese corruption of the word \"Kannada\". The early Portuguese conquistadors referred to Konkani as \"lingoa Canarim\" as a reference to Canara.\n\nKukna is distinguished from the dialect spoken by the Catholics of Mangalore which has a separate language glotto code(mang1376).\n\nKukna is mainly spoken as a minority language in the Indian States of Karnataka, and in some parts of Kerala and Maharashtra. The speakers are concentrated in the districts of Uttara Kannada district, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada in Karnataka.\n\nInflux of Konkani speakers into Canara happened in three time-lines :\n\n\nAccording to the 1991 census of India, 40.1% Konkani speakers hail from the state of Karnataka. In Karnataka over 80% of them are from the coastal districts of North and South Canara, including Udupi. 3.6% of the Konkani speakers are from Kerala, and nearly half of them are from Ernakulam district.\n\nBased on local language influence, Konkani speaking people are classified into three main regions:\n\nThis is the region north of the Gangolli river, starts from the Kali river of Karwar. North Canarites are called \"baḍgikār\" (Northerners) or simply \"baḍgi\" in Konkani. North Canara Konkani has more of Goan Konkani influence than Kannada influence compared to South Canara Konkani. The major Konkani speaking communities include:\n\n\nKarwar Konkani is different from Mangalorean or south Kanara konkani. It is similar to Goan Konkani but mixed with Kannada accented words. Although people of Karwar have their mother tongue as Konkani. Konkani speakers in North Canara are bilingual; they are well conversant in Kannada as well as Konkani. A few are conversant in Marathi too.\n\nThis is the region south of the Gangolli river. South Canarites are called \"ṭenkikār\" (Southerner) \"tenkabagli\" or simply \"ṭenki\" in Konkani. The Rajapur Saraswat, Kudalkar, Daivajna, Kumbhar, Gaud Saraswats and Chitrapur Saraswats are some of the Konkani speaking communities of this region. 15% of Dakshina Kannada speaks Konkani. South Canara Saraswats, both Gaud Saraswat and Chitrapur Saraswat affectionately refer to their dialect as \"āmcigelẽ\" (Ours)\nThis region has recently been bifurcated into Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts.\n\nKonkani speakers in South Canara are trilingual; they are conversant in Konkani, Kannada and Tulu. Some of the towns in South Canara have separate Konkani names. Udupi is called \"ūḍup\" and Mangalore is called \"kodiyāl\" in Konkani.\n\nKonkani speakers are found predominantly in the Cochin and Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kollam districts of Kerala, the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore. Kudumbis, Gaud Saraswats, Vaishya Vani of Cochin, and Daivajna are the major communities. The Konkani dialect of the Gaud Saraswats is affectionately referred to as \"koccimā̃y\" by members of that community.\n\nThe Gaud Saraswats of Cochin were part of the group of \"sāṣṭikār\"s who migrated from Goa during the Inquisition hence their dialect is, but for usage of certain Malayalam words, similar to the dialect spoken by Gaud Saraswats of South Canara.\n\nKonkani speakers in this region are bilingual; they are conversant in Konkani as well as Malayalam.\n\nKonkani in Karnataka has been in contact with Kannada and Tulu, thus showing Dravidian influence on its syntax.\n\nThe phonetics, sounds, nasalization, grammar, syntax and in turn vocabulary obviously differs from Goan Konkani.\n\nThere was a small population of Konkani speakers in Canara even before the first exodus from Goa. This group was responsible for the Shravanabelagola inscription. There was a large scale migration of Konkani communities from Goa to the coastal districts of North Canara, South Canara and Udupi as also the Shimoga district of Malnad region. This migration, caused by the persecution of the Bahamani and Portuguese rulers, took place between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries. Most of these migrants were merchants, craftsmen and artisans. These migrants were either Hindus, Muslims or Christians and their linguistic practices were influenced by this factor also. Each dialect is influenced by its geographical antecedents.\n\nThere are subtle differences in the way that Konkani is spoken in different regions: “In Karwar and Ankola, they emphasize the syllables, and in Kumta-Honavar, they use consonants in abundance. The Konkani spoken by Nawayatis of Bhatkal incorporates Persian and Arabic words.\" People of South Kanara do not distinguish between some nouns of Kannada and Konkani origin, and have developed a very business practical language. They sometimes add Tulu words also. It is but natural that Konkani has many social variations also because it is spoken by many communities such as Daivajna, Serugar, Mestri, Sutar, Gabeet, Kharvi, Samgar, Nawayati, etc.\n\nContinuous inter action between the Konkani speaking communities with Dravidian Languages over a period of time has resulted in influences at the levels of morphology, syntax, vocabulary and larger semantic units such as proverbs and idioms. This phenomenon is illustrated by Nadkarni, Bernd Heine and Tanya Kuteva in their writings.\n\nMany Kannada words such as \"duḍḍu\" (money), \"baḍḍi\" (stick) and \"bāgilu\" (door) have found permanent places in Kukna. Kukna from Kerala has Malayalam words like sari/śeri (correct), etc.\n\nDialect Variation\n\nFrom the above table we see that South Canara and Kerala Hindu dialects undergo doubling of consonants \"āppaytā\" (calls), \"dzāllẽ\" (done), \"kellẽ\" (did), \"vhaṇṇi\" (sister in law) whereas North Canara Hindu dialects use the un-doubled ones \"āpaytā\", \"dzālẽ\", \"kelẽ\", \"vhaṇi\"' . The Gaud Saraswat and Kudumbi Kochi dialects uses \" ca\" and \"ja\" in place \" tsa\" and \" dza\" respectively.\n\nKonkani speakers in Karnataka, having interacted with Kannada speakers in North Canara, Kannada and Tulu speakers in South Canara and Malayalam speakers in Kerala, their dialects have been influenced by Kannada, Tulu and Malayalam. This has resulted in Dravidian influence on their syntax. According to the linguists, Konkani in Karnataka has undergone a process of \"degenitivization\", and is moving towards \"dativization\" on the pattern of Dravidian languages. \"Degenitivization\" means the loss or replacement of the genitives, and \"dativization\" means replacement of the genitive in the donor language (i.e. Konkani) by the dative case marker in the recipient language (i.e. Kannada). E.g.:\n\nIn Karnataka Konkani present continuous tense is strikingly observable, which is not so prominent in Goan Konkani.\nPresent indefinite of the auxiliary is fused with present participle of the primary verb, and the auxiliary is partially dropped. This difference became more prominent in dialects spoken in Karnataka, which came in contact with Dravidian languages, whereas Goan Konkani still retains the original form.\n\n\nScript\n\nEarly Konkani literature in Goa, Karnataka and Kerala has been found in the Nāgarī Script. At present however, Konkani in the Devanagari script has been promulgated as an Official Language.\n\nAmongst the inscriptions at the foot of the colossal statue of Bahubali at Shravanabelagola in Karnataka are two lines reading thus:\n\nThe first line was inscribed circa 981 AD and the second line in 1016-17 AD. The language of these lines is Konkani according to Dr. S.B. Kulkarni (former head of Department of Marathi, Nagpur University) and Dr. Jose Pereira (former professor, Fordham University, US). Considering these arguments, these inscriptions at Sravanabelegola may be considered the earliest Konkani inscriptions in the Nāgarī script.\n\nA piece of poetry attributed to the twelfth century and worded in Konkani runs as follows,\n\n\nIt can be said beyond doubt, that nothing has been written for a long period up to 1900 which is an awareness, is perceived in the case of Konkani. The wilderness may be attributed to the lack of consciousness, amongst the Konkani speaking people, as to the importance of the preservation of records\n\nThe earliest known Konkani epigraphy is the rock inscription at Shravanabelagola, Karnataka. Another writing of antiquity is a रायसपत्र \"Rāyasapatra\" (writ) By Srimad Sumatindra Tirtha swamiji to his disciples.\n\nIn Konkani, Ramayana narration is found in both verse and prose. The story has been told in full or part in folksongs of the Kudubis and ritualistic forms like \"goḍḍe rāmāyaṇ\" of Kochi, \"sītā suddi\" and \"sītā kalyāṇa\" of Northern Kerala/South Canara and the \"rāmāyaṇa raṇmāḷe\" of Cancon. Some other texts of Ramayana too are available in written form in Konkani. rāmāyaṇācyo kāṇiyo, ascribed to Krishnadas Shama is in 16th century prose. During 1930s Late Kamalammal wrote the \"raghurāmāyaṇa\" in \"vhōvi\" style verse. There have also been an adapted version by late Narahari Vittal Prabhu of Gokarn and recently, the translation of rāmacaritramānasa by Kochi Ananta Bhat of Kochi.\n\nHortus Malabaricus (meaning Garden of Malabar) is a comprehensive treatise that deals with the medicinal properties of the flora in the Indian state of Kerala. Originally written in Latin, it was compiled over a period of nearly 30 years and published from Amsterdam during 1678–1693. The book was conceived by Hendrik van Rheede, who was the Governor of the Dutch administration in Kochi (formerly Cochin) at the time.\n\nThough the book was the result of the indomitable will power of Hendrik Van Rheede, all the basic work and the original compilation of plant properties was done by three Konkani Physicians of Kochi, namely Ranga Bhat, Vināyaka Pandit and Appu Bhat. The three have themselves certified this in their joint certificate in Konkani, which appears as such at the start of the first volume of the book.\n\nThis book also contains the Konkani names of each plant, tree and creeper are also included throughout the book, in all 12 volumes, both in its descriptive parts and alongside their respective drawings. While the names are in Roman script in the descriptive part, the names alongside the diagrams are in original Nāgarī script itself, indicated as Bramanical characters.\nThe 17th century certificate was etched in the manner and style of those times, which may appear unfamiliar now. Further to this, some writing notations (mostly anuswara) are seen missing in the print. Hence, to make it easily readable, the body matter is reproduced herein with enhanced clarity, modern-day spacing between words, and with the missing notations added back, for the sake of coherence and comprehension.\n\nThe Dvaita seer Madhavacharya converted Smartha Konkani Gaud Saraswats to Dvaitism. This Dvaita Gaud Saraswat community was instrumental in \"kīrtanasāhitya \"and \"haridāsasāhitya\". Vasudev Prabhu was a very famous Konkani poet of the Bhakti Movement. He wrote many devotional songs in Konkani and also translated Kannada devotional poetry of Vyāsarāya, Naraharitirtha, Puranadaradāsa, Kanakadāsa. These Konkani songs were, later, sung by nārāyantirtha\n\nContemporary Konkani literature in Kerala made a rather late entry, as compared to its other concentrated states like Karnataka. However, according to historical annals, there can be established no exact evidence to relate exactly when Konkani language and literature began its predominating journey in Kerala. But a possible contact and interlinking between Goa with Kerala cannot be thrown to the wind, as collaborators in foreign trade. G Kamalammal is known to have contributed whole-heartedly to Konkani literature, in the domain of devotional writing. V. Krishna Vadyar, Bhakta R Kanhangad, S. T Chandrakala, S Kamat are some of the most renowned novelists in the Konkani dialect. Moving further ahead, V Venkates, K Narayan Naik, N Prakash and others have penned forceful short stories; P G Kamath has contributed to the sphere of essay writing.\n\nSome of the most great and legendary poets in Konkani literature from Kerala, comprise: K Anant Bhat, N Purushottam Mallya, R Gopal Prabhu, P N S Sivanand Shenoy, N N Anandan, R S Bhaskar etc. Translations, folklore, criticism also have enriched the Konkani literature in Kerala. Stepping aside a little bit and directing the attention towards analytic and detailed study, Konkani literature in Kerala has been legendary and celebrated to have formulated dictionaries and encyclopaedias in considerable numbers.\n\nKonkani speakers have retained their language and culture in Karnataka and Kerala. Music, theatre and periodicals keep these communities in touch with the language.\n\nNotable periodicals are \"pānchkadāyi, kodial khabar and sansakār bōdh\".\n\nKonkani theatre made a rather late entry into the Indian art scenario. Konkani theatre groups like\" rangakarmi kumbaḷe śrīnivās bhaṭ pratiṣṭhān, and raṅgayōgi rāmānand cūryā vēdike\" played an instrumental role in bringing Konkani theatre to the masses. \"raṅgakarmi \"Kumble Shrinivas Bhat, Late Hosad Babuti Naik, Late Late K. Balakrishna Pai (\"kuḷḷāppu\"), Sujeer Srinivas Rao (\"cinna kāsaragōḍ\") and Vinod Gangolli are some noteworthy names. Ramananda Choorya was an eminent artist who encouraged people to develop Konkani theatre. He wrote the famous play \"dōni ghaḍi hāssunu kāḍi\".\n\n"}

These codes may be used to organize library collections or presentations of data, to choose the correct localizations and translations in computing, and as a shorthand designation for longer forms of language-name.\n\nLanguage code schemes attempt to classify the complex world of human languages, dialects, and variants. Most schemes make some compromises between being general and being complete enough to support specific dialects.\n\nFor example, most people in Central America and South America speak Spanish. Spanish spoken in Mexico will be slightly different from Spanish spoken in Peru. Different regions of Mexico will have slightly different dialects and accents of Spanish. A language code scheme might group these all as \"Spanish\" for choosing a keyboard layout, most as \"Spanish\" for general usage, or separate each dialect to allow region-specific idioms.\n\nSome common language code schemes include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27470", "title": "Languages of Switzerland", "text": "Languages of Switzerland\n\nThe four national languages of Switzerland are German, French, Italian and Romansh. All but Romansh maintain equal status as official languages at the national level within the Federal Administration of the Swiss Confederation. In some situations, Latin is used, particularly as a single language to denote the country.\n\nIn 2016, the population of Switzerland was 62.8% native speakers of German (59.4% speak Swiss German and/or 10.6% Standard German at home); 22.9% French (mostly Swiss French, but including some Arpitan dialects); 8.2% Italian (mostly Swiss Italian, but including Lombard dialects); and 0.5% Romansh. The German region (\"Deutschschweiz\") is roughly in the east, north and center; the French part (\"la Romandie\") in the west and the Italian area (\"Svizzera italiana\") in the south. There remains a small Romansh-speaking native population in Graubünden in the east. The cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Valais are officially bilingual; the canton of Graubünden is officially trilingual.\n\nThe main languages of Swiss residents from 1950 to 2015, in percentages, were as follows:\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, respondents could indicate more than one language, causing the percentages to exceed 100%.\n\nThe German-speaking part of Switzerland (, , , ) constitutes about 65% of Switzerland (North Western Switzerland, Eastern Switzerland, Central Switzerland, most of the Swiss Plateau and the greater part of the Swiss Alps).\n\nIn seventeen of the Swiss cantons, German is the only official language (Aargau, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft, Glarus, Luzern, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Uri, Zug, and Zürich).\n\nIn the cantons of Bern, Fribourg and Valais, French is co-official; in the trilingual canton of Graubünden, more than half of the population speaks German, while the rest speak Romansh or Italian. In each case, all languages are official languages of the respective canton.\n\nWhile the French-speaking Swiss prefer to call themselves \"Romands\" and their part of the country is the Romandy, the German-speaking Swiss used to (and, colloquially, still do) refer to the French-speaking Swiss as \"Welsche\", and to their area as \"Welschland\", which has the same etymology as the English (see \"Walha\"). In Germany \"Welsch\" and \"Welschland\" refer to Italy; there, the term is antiquated, rarely used, and somewhat disparaging.\n\nThe German-speaking Swiss do not feel like a uniform group: the average German-speaking Swiss sees himself belonging foremost to his canton, and does not consider himself as a speaker of Swiss German, but, for example, \"Baseldytsch\" (dialect of Basel), \"Bärndütsch\" (dialect of Bern) or \"Züridütsch\" (dialect of Zurich). This is hardly surprising, however, since there is no single unifying or standard form of Swiss German itself: rather the term \"Swiss German\" is simply a generic umbrella term referring in general to all of the various different Alemannic German dialects within German-speaking Switzerland. The marked subsidiarity of the Swiss federalism, where many political decisions are taken at municipal or cantonal level, supports this attitude.\n\nNevertheless, in 2016, 10.6%, or about 871,800 of the Swiss residents speak Standard German (\"Hochdeutsch\") at home, but this statistic is probably mainly due to German (and Austrian) immigrants.\n\nBy the Middle Ages, a marked difference had developed within the German-speaking part of Switzerland between the rural cantons (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Glarus, Zug, Appenzell, Schaffhausen) and the city cantons (Lucerne, Berne, Zurich, Solothurn, Fribourg, Basel, St. Gallen), divided by views about trade and commerce. After the Reformation, all cantons were either Catholic or Protestant, and the denominational influences on culture added to the differences. Even today, when all cantons are somewhat denominationally mixed, the different historical denominations can be seen in the mountain villages, where Roman Catholic Central Switzerland abounds with chapels and statues of saints, and the farm houses in the very similar landscape of the Protestant Bernese Oberland show Bible verses carved on the housefronts instead.\n\nIn addition to this more widespread notion of Swiss German dialect, there is also Walser German, another Highest Alemannic speech brought by Walser emigrants from Valais.\n\nRomandy (, , ) is the French-speaking part of Switzerland. It covers the area of the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Neuchâtel, and Jura as well as the French-speaking parts of the cantons of Bern (German-speaking majority), Valais (French-speaking majority), and Fribourg (French-speaking majority). 1.9 million people (or 24.4% of the Swiss population) live in Romandy.\n\nStandard Swiss French and the French of France are the same language, with some differences. For example, like some other regions of the French-speaking world, Swiss people (as well as most Francophone Belgians) use \"septante\" (seventy) instead of \"soixante-dix\" (literally, \"sixty ten\") and \"nonante\" (ninety) instead of \"quatre-vingt-dix\" (\"four twenties and ten\"). In the cantons of Vaud, Valais and Fribourg, speakers use \"huitante\" (eighty) instead of the Standard French \"quatre-vingts\" (four twenties). \"Sou\" is used throughout Romandy for a 5-centime coin, as is \"tune\" (or \"thune\") when referring to a 5-Swiss-franc piece.\n\nHistorically, the vernacular language used by inhabitants of most parts of Romandy was Franco-Provençal. Franco-Provençal (also called Arpitan) is a language sometimes considered to be halfway between the langue d'oïl (the historical language of northern France and ancestor of French) and Occitan (the langue d'oc, spoken in southern France). Standard French and Franco-Provençal/Arpitan, linguistically, are distinct and mutual intelligibility is limited. Increasingly, Franco-Provençal/Arpitan is used only by members of the older generations.\n\nThe term \"Romandy\" does not formally exist in the political system, but is used to distinguish and unify the French-speaking population of Switzerland. The television channel Télévision Suisse Romande (TSR) serves the \"Romande\" community across Switzerland, is syndicated to TV5 and CanalSat Romande.\n\nItalian Switzerland (, , , ) is the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, which includes the canton of Ticino and the southern part of Graubünden. Italian is also spoken in the Gondo Valley (leading to the Simplon Pass, on the southern part of the watershed) in Valais.\n\nThe linguistic region covers an area approximately 3,500 km² and has a total population of around 350,000 inhabitants, with the number of Italophones residing in Switzerland being 545,274 (about 7% of the Swiss population).\n\nThe proportion of Italian-speaking inhabitants had been decreasing since the 1970s, after reaching a high of 12% of the population during the same decade. This was entirely because of the reduced number of immigrants from Italy to Switzerland, but gained again during the last decade.\n\nOn the cantonal level, Romansh is an official language only in the trilingual canton of Graubünden, where the municipalities in turn are free to specify their own official languages.\n\nSignificant communities of Romansh speakers remain in the Surselva, the Sursés/Oberhalbstein, the lower Engadin and the Val Müstair.\n\nRomansh has been recognized as one of four \"national languages\" by the Swiss Federal Constitution since 1938. It was also declared an \"official language\" of the Confederation in 1996, meaning that Romansh speakers may use their language for correspondence with the federal government and expect to receive a Romansh response. (Although Romansh is split into several dialects, the federal authorities use the standardized version (\"Romansh Grischun\") exclusively.)\n\nBesides the national languages and the many varieties of Swiss German, several regional Romance languages are spoken natively in Switzerland: Franco-Provençal and Lombard. About 20,000 Romani speak Sinte, an Indic language. Five sign languages are used: Swiss-German, French, Italian, Austrian, and German.\n\nTo avoid having to translate the name of Switzerland in the four national languages, Latin is used on the coins of the Swiss franc (\"Helvetia\" or \"Confoederatio Helvetica\") and on Swiss stamps (\"Helvetia\"). The country code top-level domain for Switzerland on the internet is .ch, the abbreviation of the Latin name, \"Confoederatio Helvetica\" (Swiss Confederation); similarly, the International vehicle registration code for Swiss automobiles is \"CH\". The Federal Palace of Switzerland bears the inscription \"Curia Confoederationis Helveticae\".\n\nTo have a unique name across the country (without favoring German or English), several Swiss foundations and associations have Latin names, such as Pro Helvetia, Pro Infirmis, Pro Juventute, Pro Natura, Pro Patria, Pro Senectute, Pro Specie Rara, etc.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "838515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=838515", "title": "Lars Gustafsson", "text": "Lars Gustafsson\n\nLars Erik Einar Gustavsson (17 May 1936 – 3 April 2016) was a Swedish poet, novelist, and scholar.\n\nGustafsson was born in Västerås, completed his secondary education at the Västerås Gymnasium and continued to Uppsala University, where he studied literature, aesthetics, sociology and philosophy. In 1960, he received a licentiate degree in philosophy. In 1978, he was awarded a PhD in theoretical philosophy with a dissertation on speech and literature. He later served for four years on the university's board of regents (1994-1998).\n\nAlready by 1960 Gustafsson was publishing novels and poetry regularly. In addition to his literary work, he was editor-in-chief of the renowned literary journal \"Bonniers Litterära Magasin\" from 1962 to 1972 . He soon established international contacts, notably to the German authors in Group 47. In 1972, through a DAAD fellowship he came to West Berlin, where he lived for two years. During this period, he also traveled extensively, among other places to Australia, Singapore, Japan, Israel, and the United States. Throughout his career, he attended and participated in many international academic and cultural events. John Updike described Gustafsson as \"the enviably ideal conferee, a red-bearded fish never out of water, loving books, ideas, and discourse equally, and everywhere adept.\"\n\nHaving been invited to visit the University of Texas at Austin by its Germanic Studies department in 1972 and again in 1974, and because Austin was his wife's hometown he moved there in 1983, where he served at first as adjunct professor in Germanic Studies, later as professor, then Distinguished Professor, in the Plan II Honors program, teaching philosophy and creative writing. He returned to Sweden in 2003 while continuing to hold a research professorship in the University; in 2006, he retired. He lived in Stockholm, spending summers in Västmanland. He died at the age of 79 on 3 April 2016.\n\nGustafsson was married three times: in 1961 to Madeleine Gustafsson (two children); in 1982 to Alexandra Chasnoff (two children); in 2005 to Agneta Blomqvist. In 1981 Gustafsson converted to Judaism.\n\nIn May 2009, Lars Gustafsson declared that he would vote for the Pirate Party in the upcoming elections for the European Parliament. However, in August 2010 he left the Pirate Party in protest of its cooperation with the WikiLeaks portal, which he accused of delivering death lists for the Taliban.\n\nGustafsson published poetry, novels, short stories, critical essays, and editorials. He gained international recognition as a Swedish writer. By 1990, he had already received a dozen major literary awards including the \"Prix International Charles Veillon des Essais\" in 1983, \"Una Vita per la Letteratura\" in 1989, as well as the Swedish Bellman Prize in 1990. He won a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship for poetry in 1994. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature (the year is unknown as the Nobel Committee keeps nominations secret for 50 years). Among later awards were the in 2006, the Goethe Medal in 2009, and the Thomas Mann Prize in 2015.\n\nGustafsson's novels and poetry have been translated into fifteen languages, the most often translated being the novels \"The Death of a Beekeeper\" (En biodlares död), \"Bernard Foy's Third Castling\" (Bernard Foys tredje rockad), and \"Afternoon of a Tiler\" (En kakelsättares eftermiddag). Harold Bloom includes Gustafsson in \"The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages\" (1994, p. 557).\n\n\"The Death of a Beekeeper,\" published in 1978, is Gustafsson's best-known novel. John Updike praised it as \"a beautiful work, lyrical and bleak, resonant and terse.\" Ia Dübois has called it \"one of his greatest works.\" Eva Stenskar has written that it \"seems so effortless yet lyrical that only an artist at the height of his powers could've produced it.\" Its main theme is the agony of disease, as it follows Vesslan—a beekeeper who is dying of cancer—through entries he makes on notepads. The book's innovative structure allows Gustafsson to explore identity through its expression in a variety of forms: imagination, memory and even the mundane details of life. The book's central theme is revealed by the repeated motto of the protagonist, \"We never give up. We begin anew.\" Gustafsson himself has described it as \"A book about pain. It describes a journey into the center where pain rules—and pain can tolerate no rivals.\" The novel was re-published in 1984 as the last in a five-novel sequence \"Sprickorna i muren\" (The Cracks in the Wall), the other volumes being \"Herr Gustafsson själv\", \"Yllet\", \"Familjefesten\", and \"Sigismund\".\n\n\"Bernard Foy's Third Castling\" (1986) is nearly as well-known as \"The Death of a Beekeeper\". Its settings are Sweden, Paris, Worpsewede, Germany, and Texas. The overt genre is the detective story, but there are three plots, and Bernard Foy is three separate characters: a Houston rabbi, an old Swedish poet, and a Swedish teenager. Each gradually turns into a character in the writing of the succeeding Foy. Gustafsson said that he was prompted by a “connection to Descartes' dream argument: You start with a story and it proves to be the story of a completely different person who is dreaming up the story which proves to be the story of a third person and it is all written by one or another person.”\n\nGustafsson's two major fields of interest interacted from the start of his career. In 2003, he wrote that \"sometimes I cannot see any sharp boundary between [my literary work] and [my philosophical work]. I tend to regard myself as a philosopher who has turned literature into one of his tools.\" When asked where he finds his inspiration, Gustafsson answered \"I listen. I listen and I look. Creativity knows no rules. You can get an idea for a novel from a little something someone says, or just a face you see. A rabbi once told me that when God spoke to Moses in that bush, it wasn't in a thundering voice; it was in a very weak voice. You have to listen carefully for that voice. You have to be very sharp.\"\n\nIn 2003, \"Yllet\", the second novel in \"The Cracks in the Wall\" (Sprickorna i Muren) series was made into a feature film, directed by Jimmy Karlsson and starring Magnus Krepper.\n\nWhile the problem of identity has been the defining theme of Gustafsson's writings, his social criticism often vexed the Swedish cultural elite. As a result he is seen as a controversial writer in Sweden rather than as one embraced by the establishment.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32389702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32389702", "title": "Lexical function", "text": "Lexical function\n\nA lexical function (LF) is a tool developed within Meaning-Text Theory for the description and systematization of semantic relationships, specifically collocations and lexical derivation, between particular lexical units (LUs) of a language. LFs are also used in the construction of technical lexica (Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionaries) and as abstract nodes in certain types of syntactic representation. Basically, an LF is a function ƒ( ) representing a correspondence ƒ that associates a set ƒ(L) of lexical expressions with an LU L; in f(L), L is the keyword of ƒ, and ƒ(L) = {L´} is ƒ’s value. Detailed discussions of Lexical Functions are found in Žolkovskij & Mel’čuk 1967, Mel’čuk 1974, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2007, and Wanner (ed.) 1996; analysis of the most frequent type of lexical functions—verb-noun collocations—can be found in Gelbukh & Kolesnikova 2013.\n\nStandard LFs form a proper subset of normal LFs. A normal LF ƒ is called Standard if and only if it satisfies both following conditions:\n\n1. Broadness of the domain of ƒ: ƒ is defined for a relatively large number of keywords;\n2. Diversity of the range of ƒ: ƒ has a relatively large number of expressions as elements of its possible values and these expressions are more or less equitably distributed between different keywords.\n\nNormal LFs that do not satisfy both Conditions 1 and 2, on the one hand, and degenerate LFs, on the other, are called Non-Standard.\nAn example of a Non-Standard LF is the meaning ‘without addition of dairy product’. It has two expressions in English, a phraseological one—BLACK (with COFFEE: black coffee), and a free one—WITHOUT MILK (tea without milk is not *\"black tea\"). This meaning fails Condition 1: it is too specific and applicable only to one beverage. It thus corresponds to a Non-Standard LF.\n\n1. Syn [Lat. \"synonymum\"] = synonym.\n2.

{"id": "31367672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31367672", "title": "Lift slab construction", "text": "Lift slab construction\n\nLift slab construction (also called the Youtz-Slick Method) is a method of constructing concrete buildings by casting the floor or roof slab on top of the previous slab and then raising (jacking) the slab up with hydraulic jacks. This method of construction allows for a large portion of the work to be completed at ground level, negating the need to form floor work in place. The ability to create monolithic concrete slabs makes the lift slab construction technique useful in quickly creating structures with repetitive form work, like parking ramps. \n\nThis method of construction simultaneously began development in 1948 by both Philip N. Youtz of New York and Thomas B. Slick of Texas. Although the first patent for lift slab construction was given to Slick in 1955, the method of construction is commonly referred to as the \"Youtz-Slick Method\". His patent called for a method that would allow for fabrication to be completed at the ground level, eliminate a large portion of the formwork, create uniform floors of concrete, and reduce the labor to be completed at an elevated level.\n\nThe method was first used at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas during the construction of Northup Hall in 1952. Northrup Hall was the first full scale building erected using lift slab construction. Being such, the process drew a crowd of spectators, waiting to see if the structural integrity of the building would hold.\n\nJohnstone Hall, a Clemson University dormitory in Clemson, South Carolina, was erected using this method in 1954, as did Woodrow Wilson High School in the same year. Several of the blocks from Johnstone Hall have now been demolished.\n\nThe building located at 2150 Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, CA (or First Savings Building) is one example of lift slab construction utilized in the Bay Area in the mid-twentieth century. Built in 1969, the First Savings Building utilizes lift slab construction to support the fourteen story height of the building. The building's structural system consists of a system of trusses from which the various concrete slab floors are hung. In turn, these trusses extend out from two reinforced concrete cores which provide the main structural support for the entirety of the building.\n\nLift slab construction was also involved in the L'Ambiance Plaza collapse in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1987, and resulted in a nationwide federal investigation into this construction technique in the United States, and Connecticut imposed a temporary moratorium on lift slab construction. The failure of the structure has been primarily attributed to instability with the steel columns that were meant to support the floors. Although other factors were involved in the collapse while under construction, it is the insufficient lateral bracing that ultimately caused the structural failure.\n\nTo begin, a concrete slab is first poured on the ground level. Lifting collars are set around each of the columns and cast into place as the slab is poured around them. The lifting collars will later be used to support the slab as it is raised and secured in place. Subsequent floors and the roof are then poured and formed on top of the initial ground slab. Bond breakers are used between each floor plate to allow the slabs to separate as they are raised. Along with reducing the formwork required to create the slabs, slabs can be easily protected from inclement weather since all of the slabs remain together during the curing process.\n\nOnce the slabs have been raised to their desired height the lifting collars are welded to the columns, along with shear blocks to support the slab from beneath. To assure the security of a structure during the raising of the slabs, the hydraulic jacks, attached to the top of the columns, use synchronized consoles to lift the slabs at an even rate. Conventional methods of mounting the jacks to the columns require that the jacks are removed before continuing to raise the slabs. More recent approaches utilize welded plates, separated from the columns, to support the jack.\n\nIn Latin America, contractors have started to use a form of lift slab construction where load-bearing concrete walls are raised at the same time as the floor slabs. Both the wall panels and the floor slabs are cast on the ground. The walls are attached to the slabs through hinges formed by plastic ropes. As the floors are raised, the walls unfold into place and form the vertical support for the system.\n\n\n\n"}

Mixed ability refers to any person who has a different or \"mixed\" physical \"ability\". It can also refer to anyone who has a different emotional or learning ability. Words like disabled, crippled, and handicapped have negative connotations throughout history. Mixed ability contemporizes the label placed on those who have a different or medically documented physical or mental abilities and attempts to relieve any social or conversational stigma.\n\nThe objective in changing the term is to eliminate stereotypes that exist currently in any society in regard to those with a mixed ability.\n\nMixed ability may also refer to a group in which children of varied abilities are taught together rather than being set apart in groups according to level of learning.\n\nEducator Robert Pondiscio has argued that mixed-ability grouping in the classroom creates problems of its own, especially the neglect of higher-functioning students. He also points out that \"tracking,\" the practice of grouping students by ability, is routinely used in school sports programs, and questions whether educators are more concerned about athletic achievement than they are about academic achievement.\n\n"}
{"id": "2030906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030906", "title": "No comment", "text": "No comment\n\nNo comment is a phrase used as a response to journalistic inquiries which the respondent does not wish to answer. Public figures may decline to comment on issues they are questioned or have nothing to say about the issue at the time. \n\n\"No comment\" indicates that the speaker does not choose to say anything on the subject, and it is automatically invalidated if the speaker then comments or answers questions. It is not a request for the material to be considered \"off the record\" or otherwise kept confidential. If the speaker wishes to talk about the subject, but does not wish to be named as a source, he must obtain the journalist's explicit agreement in advance that the response is not to be used for attribution.\n\nThe first recorded usage as a stock answer to questions was made in 1950 by Charles Ross (President Harry Truman's White House press secretary).\n\nSome public relations professionals have argued against the use of \"no comment\", stating that one of the goals of working with the press is to resolve issues before they become hot topics. Offering no comment allows the press to fill in the blanks, diverts the focus of the publicity, and sacrifices an opportunity to communicate key messages.\n\n"}

Under the Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers health care, social security, tax, school, and employment authorities, the police and\ncourts. The languages included are Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish and Icelandic.\n\nThe Convention is not very well known and is mostly a recommendation. The countries have committed themselves to providing services in various languages, but citizens have no absolute rights except for criminal and court matters. The Convention does not automatically require authorities to provide services in another language but a citizen must demand an interpreter. Civil servants in official institutions are often unaware of the regulations on interpreting and translating and neglect to provide these services when requested. Furthermore, the convention excludes minority languages, like Faroese, Kalaallisut, Romany and Sami, and immigrant languages. English has also assumed an increasingly prominent role in interaction between Nordic citizens.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30858407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30858407", "title": "Not even wrong", "text": "Not even wrong\n\nThe phrase \"not even wrong\" describes an argument or explanation that purports to be scientific but is based on invalid reasoning or speculative premises that can neither be proven correct nor falsified. Hence, it refers to statements that cannot be discussed in a rigorous, scientific sense. For a meaningful discussion on whether a certain statement is true or false, the statement must satisfy the criterion called \"falsifiability\"—the inherent possibility for the statement to be tested and found false. In this sense, the phrase \"not even wrong\" is synonymous to \"nonfalsifiable\".\n\nThe phrase is generally attributed to theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who was known for his colorful objections to incorrect or careless thinking. Rudolf Peierls documents an instance in which \"a friend showed Pauli the paper of a young physicist which he suspected was not of great value but on which he wanted Pauli's views. Pauli remarked sadly, 'It is not even wrong'.\" This is also often quoted as \"That is not only not right; it is not even wrong\", or in Pauli's native German, \"\". Peierls remarks that quite a few apocryphal stories of this kind have been circulated and mentions that he listed only the ones personally vouched for by him. He also quotes another example when Pauli replied to Lev Landau, \"What you said was so confused that one could not tell whether it was nonsense or not.\"\n\nThe phrase is often used to describe pseudoscience or bad science and is considered derogatory.\n\n"}

For example, saying that codice_1 must render the text between these constructs using some bold typeface is a specification of presentation semantics for that syntax. An example of interactive presentation semantics is defining the expected behavior of a hypertext link on a suitable syntax.\n\nMany markup languages like HTML, CSS, DSSSL, XSL-FO or troff have presentation semantics, but others like XML, XLink and XPath do not. Character encoding standards like Unicode also have presentation semantics. One of the main goals of style sheet languages like CSS is to separate the syntax used to define structured data from the syntax endowed with presentation semantics that is used to render the data in various ways.\n"}
{"id": "7740632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740632", "title": "Prlwytzkofsky", "text": "Prlwytzkofsky\n\nPrlwytzkofsky is a fictional written variant of the Dutch language, based on the idiolect of the Polish-German Professor Zbigniew Prlwytzkofsky (sometimes spelled Prlwytzkofski), as featured in the Tom Puss (Tom Poes in Dutch) and Oliver B. Bumble (Olivier B. Bommel in Dutch) series by Marten Toonder.\n\nThe Professor uses several well-known catchphrases:\n\nThe language is characterised by an abundance of composite words built on the combination of words literally translated from German, but in a small number of cases including a Slavic word. Often, the particular combination in Dutch may create a hint or an echo of a totally unconnected word. For instance, \"mislinger\" (loser,failure, a person) combines the Dutch word mis (miss = wrong, failure) with the German word (ge)lingen (succeed) creating a word which hints at \"slinger\" (pendulum or festoon). The actual Dutch word is \"mislukkeling\". Professor Prlwytzkofsky calls disturbed brains \"verhoornde hersenschors\" - horned cerebral cortex. \"Verhoornd\" (horned) rhymes with \"verstoord\" (disturbed), which is the meaning here, but actually translates the German word for brain, which is \"Gehirn\". Without knowledge of the German word, one may be led to think that the phrase refers to the brains of a cuckold.\n\nA Slavic influence is obvious in Prlwytzkofsky calling his assistant Alexander Pieps (a mouse) \"Irkoetsk\" (\"short-statured assistant, who always manages to do things in the wrong way\", but of course also referring to the Siberian town).\n\nClearest examples of Germanization are:\n\n(but since all words not of the female sex but ending in a consonant or diphthong take \"Der\" as their article, this also hides a Slavic substratum and simplifies the Prlwytzkofsky gender system, compared to Dutch and German)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "276598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276598", "title": "Product placement", "text": "Product placement\n\nProduct placement, also known as embedded marketing, is a marketing technique where references to specific brands or products are incorporated into another work, such as a film or television program, with specific promotional intent.\n\nWhile references to brands may be voluntarily incorporated into works to maintain a feeling of realism and/or comment upon the brand, product placement is the deliberate incorporation of references to a brand or product in exchange for compensation. Product placements may range from unobtrusive appearances within an environment, to prominent integration and acknowledgement of the product within the work. Common categories of products used for placements include automobiles and consumer electronics. Works produced by vertically integrated companies (such as Sony) may use placements to promote their other divisions as a form of corporate synergy.\n\nDuring the 21st century, the use of product placement on television grew, particularly to combat the wider use of digital video recorders that can skip traditional commercial breaks, as well as to engage with younger demographics. Digital editing technology is also being used to tailor product placement to specific demographics or markets, and in some cases, add placements to works that did not originally have embedded advertising, or update existing placements.\n\nProduct placement began in the 19th century. By the time Jules Verne published the adventure novel \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" (1873), his fame had led transport and shipping companies to lobby to be mentioned in the story. Whether Verne was actually paid to do so, however, remains unknown. Similarly, a painting by Eduoard Manet (1881-1882) shows a bar at the Folies Bergere with distinctive bottles placed at either end of the counter. The beer bottle is immediately recognisable as Bass beer. Manet's motivations for including branded products in his painting are unknown; it may be that it simply added to the work's authenticity, but on the other hand the artist may have received some payment in return for its inclusion.\n\nResearch reported by Jean-Marc Lehu (2007) suggests that films produced by Auguste and Louis Lumière in 1876 were made at the request of a representative of Lever Brothers in France. The films feature Sunlight soap, which may be the first recorded instance of paid product placement in film. This led to cinema becoming one of the earliest channels used for product placement.\n\nWith the arrival of photo-rich periodicals in the late 19th century, publishers found ways of lifting their paper's reputation by placing an actual copy of the magazine in photographs of prominent people. For example, the German magazine \"Die Woche\" in 1902 printed an article about a countess in her castle where she, in one of the photographs, holds a copy of the magazine in her hands.\n\nProduct placement was a common feature of many of the earliest actualities and cinematic attractions from the first ten years of cinema history.\n\nDuring the next four decades, \"Harrison's Reports\" frequently cited cases of on-screen brand-name products. Harrison condemned the practice as harmful to movie theatres, and his editorials reflected his hostility towards product placement in films. \"Harrison's Reports\" published its first denunciation of that practice over Red Crown gasoline's appearance in \"The Garage\" (1920). Another editorial criticised the collaboration between the Corona Typewriter company and First National Pictures when a Corona typewriter appeared in several films in the mid-1920s including \"The Lost World\" (1925).\n\nRecognisable brand names appeared in movies from cinema's earliest history. Before films were even narrative forms in the sense that they are recognized today, industrial concerns funded the making of what film scholar Tom Gunning described as \"cinematic attractions\", short films of one or two minutes. In the first decade or so of film (1895–1907) audiences attended films as \"fairground attractions\" interesting for their then-amazing visual effects. This format was better suited to product placement than narrative cinema. Gurevitch argued that early cinematic attractions have more in common with television advertisements in the 1950s than they do with traditional films. Gurevitch suggested that as a result, the relationship between cinema and advertising is intertwined, suggesting that cinema was in part the result of advertising and the economic advantage that it provided early film makers. Segrave detailed the industries that advertised in these early films.\n\nA feature film that has expectations of reaching millions of viewers attracts marketers.\n\nIn many cases no payment is made for product exposure and no promise of marketing support is made when consumer brands appear in movies. Film productions need props for scenes, so each movie's \"property master\", who is responsible for gathering props film, contacts product placement middlemen agencies or product companies directly. In addition to items for on-screen use, the product/service supplier might provide a production with large quantities of complementary products or services. Tapping product placement channels can be particularly valuable for movies when a vintage product is required—such as a sign or bottle—that is not readily available.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive proof that product placement for Red Crown gasoline in \"The Garage\", Fritz Lang's \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\" (1922) contained a prominent title card in the opening credits reading \"The gowns of the female stars were designed by Vally Reinecke and made in the fashion studios of Flatow-Schädler und Mossner.\"\n\nAmong notable silent films to feature product placement was \"Wings\" (1927), the first to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. It contained a plug for Hershey's chocolate. Fritz Lang's film \"M\" (released in 1931) shows a banner display for Wrigley's PK Chewing Gum, for approximately 20–30 seconds.\n\nAnother early example occurs in \"Horse Feathers\" (1932), where Thelma Todd's character falls out of a canoe and into a river. She calls for a \"life saver\" and Groucho Marx tosses her a Life Savers candy. \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946) depicts a young boy with aspirations to be an explorer, displaying a prominent copy of \"National Geographic\" magazine. In \"Love Happy\" (1949), Harpo cavorts on a rooftop among various billboards and at one point escapes from the villains on the old Mobil logo, the \"Flying Red Horse\". \"Harrison's Reports\" severely criticised this scene in its film review and in a front-page editorial. In \"Gun Crazy\" (1949), the climactic crime is the payroll robbery of the Armour meat-packing plant, where a Bulova clock is prominently displayed.\n\n\"The Cannonball Run\" and \"Smokey and the Bandit\" film series featured conspicuous placements. The film \"ET\" is often cited for its multiple, obvious placements.\n\nIn the New World Pictures dub of \"The Return of Godzilla\", \"Godzilla 1984\", Dr. Pepper is subject to prominent product placement in the new scenes shot specifically for the dub. In a scene shot at an American military base, a vending machine is situated directly between two characters, and in similar scenes characters are often shown drinking the soft drink.\n\nCheerios and Coca-Cola had product placement in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical \"Evita\", in \"Superman: The Movie\" and the sequel \"Superman II\". Clark Kent eats Cheerios for breakfast in \"Smallville\". In \"Superman II\"s climax, Superman crashes into a giant Coca-Cola advertisement and saves people on a bus bearing an ad for \"Evita\", before he smashes into a Marlboro delivery truck.\n\nA more prominent example of product placement comes in the film \"Cast Away\" in which Tom Hanks, the lead character, is a FedEx employee. References to the delivery company FedEx are made throughout the film, and the company is central to the plot itself. \"The Internship\" (2013), which features two unemployed friends seeking employment at Google, was described by Tom Brook of the BBC as \"one huge advertisement for Google\" that took \"product placement to a startling new extreme\".\n\nIn other early media, e.g., radio in the 1930s and 1940s and television in the 1950s, programs were often underwritten by companies. \"Soap operas\" were so-named because they were initially underwritten by consumer packaged goods companies such as Procter & Gamble or Unilever. When television began to displace radio, DuMont's \"Cavalcade of Stars\" television show was, in its era, notable for not relying on a sole sponsor. Sponsorship continues with programs being sponsored by major vendors such as Hallmark Cards.\n\nThe conspicuous display of Studebaker motor vehicles in the television series \"Mr. Ed\" (1961–1966), which was sponsored by the Studebaker Corporation from 1961 to 1963, as well as the display of Ford vehicles on the series \"Hazel\" (1961–1966), which was sponsored by the Ford Motor Company from 1961 to 1965, are notable examples of television product placement.\n\nPlacements fall into two categories: those that are donated to reduce production costs and those placed in exchange for compensation. Lotz refers to two classifications within these two categories—\"basic\" and \"advanced\". Basic placement is when the logo of an object or a brand name is visible but the characters do not draw attention to the brand. Advanced placement is when the product or brand is mentioned by name by characters in the show or movie.\n\nBarter and service deals (mobile phones provided for crew use, for instance) are also common practices. Content providers may trade product placements for help funding advertisements tied-in with a film's release, a show's new season or other event.\n\nA variant of product placement is advertisement placement. In this case an advertisement for the product (rather than the product itself) appears in the production. Examples include a Lucky Strike cigarette advertisement on a billboard or a truck with a milk advertisement on its trailer.\n\nPlacing contemporary products into existing content creates new opportunities for marketers. Current product placements can be added to older programs when they are rerun or released on video.\n\nExamples include \"Numb3rs\" and \"Still Standing\"; where a scene may be shot originally with a blank table, with sponsored products digitally added, possibly for each airing.\n\nAs of 2007, dynamic or switchable placements became possible. Placements can be customised based upon factors such as demographics, psychographics or behavioral information about the consumer. In-game advertising vendors such as Massive Incorporated transmit user information such as individual player IDs and data about what was on the screen and for how long to their servers, enabling user-specific placements.\n\nHypervideo techniques allow the insertion of interactive elements into video.\n\nA variant of product placement is brand integration, which varies from placement when \"the product or company name becomes part of the show in such a way that it contributes to the narrative and creates an environment of brand awareness beyond that produced by advanced placement.\" While this type of advertising is common on unscripted shows such as \"The Apprentice\", it can also be used in scripted television. An early example was by Abercrombie & Fitch, when one of its stores provided the notional venue for part of the romantic comedy film \"Man's Favorite Sport?\" (1964). On \"All My Children\" one character took a job at Revlon. The character's job became part of the character's development.\n\n\"Jurassic Park\" not only prominently features Ford cars and other commercial products, but also includes a scene displaying its own promotional merchandise. One shot shows the \"Jurassic Park Souvenir Store\", with products that it offered for sale to fans.\n\nAccording to Danny Boyle, director of the film \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (2008), the makers used \"product displacement\" to accommodate sponsors such as Mercedes-Benz that refused to allow their products to be used in non-flattering settings. While Mercedes did not mind having a gangster driving their cars, they objected to their products being shown in a slum. The makers removed logos digitally in post-production, costing \"tens of thousands of pounds\". When such issues are brought up in advance of filming, production companies often resort to \"greeking\", the practice of simply covering logos with tape, but one of them driven by Latika is shown to have the logos on the car keys.\n\nSimilarly, in \"The Blues Brothers\" (1980), portions of the defunct Dixie Square Mall in Harvey, Illinois, were reconstructed in façade and used as the scene of an indoor car chase. Signage belonging to mall tenants was replaced with that of other vendors; for instance, a Walgreens would become a Toys \"R\" Us.\n\n\"Cars\" (2006) parodies NASCAR, an advertising-heavy sport which controversially had long allowed alcohol and tobacco sponsorships. NASCAR's sponsors were replaced with fictional or parody brands; Dinoco Oil takes pride of place, followed by a string of invented automotive aftermarket products positioned as pharmacy or medical brands. \"Dale Earnhardt Inc.\" displaced \"Junior #8\"'s sponsor Budweiser to avoid advertising beer in a Disney feature. NASCAR's former Winston Cup trophy became the Piston Cup, removing a tobacco advertisement.\n\nPlacements can be sound-only, visual-only or a combination of both. The Russian television show дом-2 (phonetically \"Dom-2\") (similar to \"Big Brother\") often features participants stating something along the lines of, \"Oh, did you check out the new product X by company Y yet?\" after which the camera zooms in on the named product, explicitly combining an audio mention with a visual image. In \"The Real World/Road Rules Challenge\" participants often make a similar comment, usually pertaining to the mobile device and carrier for a text message.\n\nIn 2010 Wal-Mart teamed with Procter & Gamble to produce \"Secrets of the Mountain\" and \"The Jensen Project\", both family-oriented films that display the characters using Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble- branded products. \"The Jensen Project\" also featured a preview of Kinect.\n\nAdvertiser Funded Programming is one of the ways the \"\" managed to fund 2 Seasons (Season 2 & 3) with funding from the leading supermarket in Zimbabwe TM Pick n Pay.\n\n20th Century Fox regularly uses their sister Fox News and Sky News channels in their films by including them as a plot device when characters view news broadcasts. The channel is featured in a film depends on its setting. The character typically says that the audience is viewing Sky News. Examples include the 1996 films \"Independence Day\" and .\n\nThe pilot episode of the NBC sitcom \"30 Rock\" featured the General Electric (at the time an 80% owner of NBC) Trivection oven, but was said to be a joke by the show's creator. The show later parodied placement.\n\nThe 1988 film \"Return of the Killer Tomatoes\" mocked the concept when at one point the film stops for lack of money. The character played by George Clooney suggests product placement as a way to continue. This was followed by several scenes with blatant product placement, including a Pepsi billboard installed in front of the villain's mansion.\n\nThe film \"Fight Club\", directed by David Fincher, bit the hand that fed it by depicting acts of violence against most of the products that paid to be placed in the film. Examples include the scene where the Apple Store is broken into, the scene where Brad Pitt and Edward Norton smash the headlights of a new Volkswagen Beetle, and try to blow up a \"popular coffee franchise\", a thinly veiled dig at Starbucks.\n\nThe film \"Superstar\", starring Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon, shows every resident in town driving Volkswagen New Beetles, possibly for comic effect. Similarly, the film \"Mr. Deeds\" shows Adam Sandler's character purchasing a Chevrolet Corvette for every resident of his town.\n\n\"Wayne's World\" featured a scene where Wayne refuses to allow his show's sponsor to appear on the air. When told it is part of his contract, Wayne argues that the deal \"didn't include selling out\" while conspicuously drinking a can of Pepsi, eating Doritos, and displaying a Pizza Hut pizza. Garth then laments that \"people only do things because they get paid\" while his entire wardrobe consists of Reebok athletic wear. Finally, Wayne complains of a headache and Garth advises him to take Nuprin while cutting to a few seconds of a Nuprin TV ad.\n\n\"Kung Pow! Enter the Fist\" spoofed its product placements, highlighting the anachronistic inclusion of a Taco Bell. In a similar vein, in \"\", the main characters stumble across a Wal-Mart while stranded in the middle of Death Valley and acquire supplies just for providing an endorsement. \"\" poked fun at its sponsor Sony by having one character give another a Blu-ray Disc with the tagline \"It's a Sony\", only for them to complain that they do not have a Blu-ray player, to which the character responds with a version in Betamax.\n\n\"X-Files\" (1993–2002) (as well as many other films and television productions) featured the fictional Morley brand of cigarettes, the choice of the Cigarette Smoking Man. The company producing Morleys was also involved in a cover-up conspiracy, \"Brand X\".\n\n\"Ghostbusters\" had a faux product in the climax of the film when the team faces the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Previously in the film, Stay-Puft brand marshmallows are shown in Dana's apartment and a Stay-Puft billboard is visible (via a matte painting) when the Ghostbusters' storage grid is deactivated and the imprisoned ghosts are released. Similar in form, Mel Brooks used the same device in the comedy spoof \"Spaceballs\", which parodied \"Star Wars\": in one scene, he opened up a can of Perri-Air canned air, a play on the name Perrier, the brand of fresh spring water.\n\n\"The Truman Show\" utilized faux placements to advance the narrative of the reality television set. The protagonist's wife places products in front of hidden cameras, even naming them in dialogue with her husband. This increases Truman's suspicions as he comes to realise his surroundings are intentionally fabricated.\n\nSome filmmakers created fictional products that appear in multiple movies. Examples include Kevin Smith (Nails Cigarettes, Mooby Corporation, Chewlees Gum, Discreeto Burritos) and Quentin Tarantino (Red Apple Cigarettes, Jack Rabbit Slim's Restaurants, Big Kahuna Burger). This went even further with the fictional brand Binford Tools which appeared in TV shows \"Home Improvement\" and \"Last Man Standing\" and in the \"Toy Story\" movie franchise, all starring Tim Allen.\n\nThis practice is also fairly common in certain comics, such as Svetlana Chmakova's \"Dramacon\", which makes several product-placement-esque usages of \"Pawky\", (a modification of the name of the Japanese snack \"Pocky\", popular among anime and manga fans) or Naoko Takeuchi's \"Sailor Moon\", which includes numerous references to the series \"\", from which \"Sailor Moon\" was spun off.\n\nThis practice is also common in certain \"reality-based\" video games such as the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, which feature fictitious stores such as Ammu-Nation, Vinyl Countdown, Gash (spoofing Gap) Zip, Pizza Boy, etc.\n\nSo-called \"reverse product placement\" creates real products to match those seen in a fictional setting. For example, in 2007, 7-Eleven rebranded 11 of its American stores and one Canadian store as \"Kwik-E-Marts\", selling versions of products seen in episodes of \"The Simpsons\", such as Buzz Cola and Krusty-O's cereal. In 1997, Acme Communications was created as a chain of real television stations; the firm is named for the fictional Acme Corporation of Warner Brothers fame. \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" (1971) led to a real Willy Wonka candy company, established soon after the film's release.\n\nIn 1949, Crazy Eddie was created as a fictional car dealer in the film \"A Letter to Three Wives\". That name, bestowed in 1971 upon a real-life electronics chain in New York City, appeared in 1984 in an ad in \"Splash\". Crazy Eddie's memorable ads are parodied in \"Howard the Duck\", featuring a duck version of the famous pitchman, and \"UHF\", as \"Crazy Ernie\", a used car salesman, threatens to club a baby seal if nobody comes in to buy a car.\n\nWhile radio and television stations are regulated by national governments, producers of printed or recorded works are not, leading marketers to attempt to get products mentioned in lyrics of popular songs.\n\nIn 2008, The Kluger Agency was claimed to have proposed placement of \"Double Happiness Jeans\", a virtual sweatshop created as part of the \"Invisible Threads\" project for the 2008 Sundance Festival, in a Pussycat Dolls song for a fee. The firm was not intended to represent a commercial product. It had been invented as a collaboration between Jeff Crouse of the Anti-Advertising Agency and Stephanie Rothenberg. While the product technically existed at the time, \"Double Happiness\" was intended to be a critical piece.\n\nIn January 2009, \"Migra Corridos\", a five-song EP including accordion ballad \"El Mas Grande Enemigo\", had received airplay on twenty-five Mexican radio stations. The tune purports to be the lament of a would-be immigrant left to die in the Arizona desert by coyotes (people smugglers). No disclosure was made to the radio stations that the U.S. Border Patrol had commissioned the project with content devised by Elevación, a Hispanic advertising agency based in Washington, D.C. and New York City.\n\nIn 2010, a video for Lady Gaga's \"Telephone\" was panned by critics for displaying nine brands in nine minutes (including her own line of Heartbeats headphones), many as paid product placements. Other 2010 music videos displayed the PlentyofFish website include Natasha Bedingfield's \"Touch\", Flo Rida and Akon's \"Available\", Jason Derulo's \"Ridin' Solo\", and 3OH!3's \"Double Vision\".\n\nIn 2011, Britney Spears's music video for \"Hold It Against Me\" advertised PlentyofFish and Sony; one \"Washington Post\" review denounced the video as an informercial.\n\nJennifer Lopez's Fiat-sponsored music video \"Papi\" was edited for broadcast as a 30-second advertisement for the Fiat 500 Cabrio in 2011. The original video also advertised BlackBerry, Tous, Planet Love Match and Crown Royal.\n\nAlcohol advertising in music videos drew criticism from Curtin University in Perth, Australia in 2011. An Alcohol Beverages Advertising Code (ABAC) exists in Australia to handle complaints, but a placement of Midori liqueur in Cobra Starship's \"You Make Me Feel...\" was judged not to be alcohol advertising.\n\nSouth African football comic book \"Supa Strikas\" accepts product placement to allow for the comic's free distribution. Product placement occurs throughout the publication; on players' shirts, billboards and signage, and through the branding of locations or scenarios. \"Supa Strikas\" receives the majority of its support from Chevron, via its Caltex and Texaco brands.\n\nIn markets where Chevron lacks a presence, other brands step in, e.g., including Visa in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Other brands include their logos included as both billboard and background advertising, and through the branding of locations and scenarios. These companies include Metropolitan Life, Nike, Spur Steak Ranches and the South African National Roads Agency, among others.\n\nOther titles adopted the same system, including cricket comic \"Supa Tigers\" and \"Strike Zone\".\n\nProduct placement has long been prevalent in sports at all levels.\n\nWhile now-defunct NFL Europe allowed liberal use of team uniforms by sponsors, the main National Football League (NFL) does not. For instance, the league prohibits logos of sponsors painted onto the fields, although Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, has their stadium's logomark painted onto the FieldTurf field. In 2008, the league allowed sponsors on the practice jerseys of the uniforms, but not game uniforms.\n\nIn 1991, the league allowed uniform suppliers to display their logos on their NFL-related products. Since 2012, Nike has been the league's official uniform supplier.\n\nEarly on, two of the league's flagship teams—the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers—adopted their identity from corporate sponsors. The Packers adopted the name \"Packers\" because they were sponsored by the Indian Packing Company. They later had \"ACME PACKERS\" written on their uniforms in the early 1920s after the Acme Packing Company bought Indian Packing. The Steelers adopted their current logo in 1962 as a product-placement deal with the American Iron and Steel Institute, which owned the rights to the Steelmark logo. The Steelers later were allowed to add \"-ers\" to the Steelmark logo the following year so that they could own a trademark on the logo. (The Steelers' pre-NFL predecessors also regularly sold naming rights to companies in the Pittsburgh area.)\n\nThe league has placed itself. NFL Japan was a sponsor of the football-themed anime series \"Eyeshield 21\".\n\nIn automobile racing, the concept of the factory-backed contestant, who is provided with vehicles and technical support in return for the car's manufacturer obtaining visibility for its products in competition, dates in NASCAR to the 1950s and Marshall Teague's factory-backed Fabulous Hudson Hornet. \"Win on Sunday, sell on Monday\" was once a common adage among automakers.\n\nAutomobiles, apparel, beverages, home goods, furniture, consumer electronics, computers, restaurants, financial institutions, travel, airlines and websites are just a few of the product categories.\n\nFedex provided vehicles, access, and logistical support for the making of \"Cast Away\". The movie depicted real Fedex locations, and the company's CEO appeared in one scene.\n\nThe most common products to be promoted in this way are automobiles. Frequently, all the important vehicles in a film or television series are supplied by one manufacturer.\n\nLuxury vehicles like Aston Martin, Mercedes, Audi, BMW utilize brand integration in films like \"Iron Man 3\", \"Spectre\", and \"Jurassic World\". \n\n\"Cars\" (2006) portrays a mix of real and fictional vehicles as characters. None are directly paid product placements, but many are factory-backed by manufacturers who provided technical assistance and vehicles during production. The Lexus LC 500 was featured in the 2018 film \"Black Panther (film)\". The Audi R8 was featured in the Iron Man film series, while the Acura NSX Roadster was featured in The Avengers.\n\nTom Ford has utilised brand integration to elevate his fashion brand in movies like \"Skyfall\", music from Jay Z's \"Magna Carta\", and television shows like \"Empire\".\n\nVera Wang, Caroline Herrera, Christian Lacroix, Lanvin, Dior, Oscar De La Renta, and Vivienne Westwood were all featured in the TV series \"Sex and the City\".\n\nUnder Armour, an athletic wear company, currently worth $6.67 billion, has been featured in films such as the \"Fast and the Furious\" \"The Martian\", \"22 Jump Street\", and \"Fantastic Four\" to name a few.\n\nApple's products frequently appear in films, music videos and on television. Apple has stated that they do not pay for this, but declined to discuss how its products are placed; some Apple placements may have stemmed from the brand's position as a status symbol rather than actual paid promotion. Similarly, Pixar films have often featured references to Apple products, although these are an homage to the involvement of its founder, Steve Jobs, as an early investor in the studio.\n\nThe 2010 \"Modern Family\" episode \"Game Changer\" prominently featured the iPad and aired prior to its launch, while the 2015 episode \"Connection Lost\" is presented entirely from the perspective of a character's Macbook Pro laptop, with all interactions between characters being conducted via FaceTime and iMessage. Show creator Steven Levitan said the show had an ongoing relationship with Apple, but did not elaborate further. In the case of the former, while the episode's credits did state that the iPad was \"provided\" by Apple, the company did not pay the show's broadcaster ABC for the integration, nor buy any commercial time during the episode.\n\nOwing to its common ownership, Sony Pictures films have featured placements of Sony consumer electronics products, particularly Sony Xperia smartphones, amongst other products. The \"James Bond\" films \"Skyfall\" and \"Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre\" prominently feature placements of the Sony Xperia T and Sony Xperia Z5 smartphones respectively, and Sony released editions of the T and Xperia Z5 Compact branded as tie-ins for the films.\n\nIn video games, the most common placements are for processors or graphics cards. For example, in EA's \"Battlefield 2142\", ads for Intel Core 2 processors appear on map billboards. EA's \"The Sims\" contains in-game advertising for Intel and for McDonald's. Rare's \"Perfect Dark Zero\" features many ads for Samsung in their menus.\n\nIn the TV adaptation of DC's Green Arrow, several characters noticeably use devices with Microsoft's Windows 8 and 10.\n\nThe use of Reese's Pieces as a prominent plot element in the film \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" was the result of a sponsorship deal; it was originally intended for the titular character's favorite food to be M&Ms candies, but Mars, Incorporated turned down an offer, believing the film's alien would scare children. The Hershey Company took the sponsorship instead, which included the rights for the company to cross-promote Reese's Pieces with the film. The deal was considered a major coup for the company; sales of Reese's Pieces tripled, and some retailers had trouble meeting demand for the product. For a few years after the film's release, Reese's ran commercials featuring a purple-skinned alien (who looked nothing like E.T.) that came down to Earth and bonded with Earth children by offering them Reese's Pieces.\n\nAlongside criticism for trying to ride off the popularity of \"E.T.\", the film \"Mac and Me\" was widely criticised for containing numerous placements for Coca-Cola soft drinks and the fast food chain McDonald's; both brands are integral to the film's plot, while McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald makes an appearance during a dance scene set at a McDonald's, and is credited as appearing in the film \"as himself\". Critics also noted that the name of the alien creature featured in the film, \"Mac\", could also be interpreted as a reference to the chain's notable burger, the Big Mac. Its producer R.J. Louis denied that the film was funded by McDonald's; he had previously worked on campaigns for the company and wanted to make a film that would help benefit the Ronald McDonald House Charities, and had to pursue rights to portray the McDonald's brand in the film (noting that he was \"still the only person in the universe that ever had the exclusive motion picture rights to the McDonald's trademark, their actors, their characters, and the whole company\"), but did receive funding from one of the chain's major suppliers, Golden State Foods. He also justified the extended dance scene, as trips to McDonald's were often seen as a \"treat\" for children of the era, and explained that \"Mac\" was meant to be an acronym for \"Mysterious Alien Creature\".\n\nSylvester Stallone's \"Rocky\" films featured heavy product placement. The most obvious example appeared in \"Rocky III\": when Rocky spends time with his young son, he asks him what he wants for breakfast. The boy responds, \"Wheaties!\" and, at Rocky's prompting, adds that it's \"the breakfast of champions!\"\n\nTobacco companies have made direct payment to stars for using their cigarettes in films. Sylvester Stallone received US$500,000 to use Brown and Williamson tobacco products in five feature films.\n\nIn response to a \"Christian Science Monitor\" article accusing the industry of deliberately using product placement as an advertising strategy, the Tobacco Institute claimed that product placement is driven by filmmakers to \"achieve desired artistic effects but also to offset production costs\". It also claimed \"the 1970 federal ban on cigarette advertising on television and radio does not prohibit payments to filmmakers for the use of cigarettes in a film.\" The rebuttal concludes with the sentiment that smoking in film provides a certain \"aesthetic\" which is legitimate and at the filmmaker's discretion.\n\nMany airlines have advertised prominently in film, in some cases to promote a new flight route or just to increase public awareness of the company. Pan American World Airways advertised in many films, including some James Bond ones. American Airlines was advertised in \"Home Alone\" and \"Home Alone 2\", and a model of a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 was shown in \"Wayne's World\". Mike Myers' later film, \"\", featured a major promotion with Virgin, including repainting some of Virgin's fleet to read \"Virgin Shaglantic\".\n\nUnited Airlines was mentioned in the title of the movie \"United 93\"; this movie, however, was based on a real life event.\n\nAmerican Airlines and Hilton Hotels were featured in the film \"Up in the Air\". George Clooney, an avid flyer is constantly seen in the airport because of his career. This film was a huge endorsement for American Airlines, yet no payment was exchanged between the filmmaker and the airline.\n\nTurkish Airlines was featured in the film \"Batman v Superman\". Warner Bros and Turkish Airlines signed a contract together to help promote and endorse the film.\n\nThe list of television shows with the most instances of product placement (November 2007 – 2008; according to Nielsen Media Research) included:\nNielsen called a scene in an episode of CBS' \"Mike & Molly\" of Mike eating M&M's in Carl's apartment 2013's best branded and opinion-shifting product integration in a scripted show.\n\nYouTubers are allowed to do product placement. For instance, the \"LinusTechTips\" channel by Linus Sebastian. Notifying YouTube is required, and YouTube reserves the right to ban it.\n\nIn 2001, British author Fay Weldon published \"The Bulgari Connection\", a novel commissioned by Italian jewellery company Bulgari. According to \"The Independent\", this was the first instance of a literary product-placement deal between an established writer of fiction and a commercial partner.\n\nMuch of U.S. broadcast law pertaining to on-air product promotion dates to the payola scandals of 1950s broadcast radio. An investigation launched in November 1959 into allegations that some radio disc jockeys had accepted bribes in return for radio airplay ended with a US$2,500 fine for disc jockey Alan Freed (of WABC and WINS) for violating commercial bribery laws. On September 13, 1960, the U.S. government banned payola in broadcasting. Under \"All matter broadcast by any radio station for which money, service, or other valuable consideration is directly or indirectly paid, or promised to or charged or accepted by, the station so broadcasting, from any person, shall, at the time the same is so broadcast, be announced as paid for or furnished, as the case may be, by such person...\" with similar and related provisions reflected in Federal Communications Commission regulations as .\n\nThese provisions have governed subsequent payola investigations, including a 2005 investigation into Sony BMG and other major record companies.\n\nOften, a broadcaster claimed to have complied by placing an acknowledgement in an inconspicuous place, such as embedded within the credits. In 2005 U.S. Federal Communications Commission commissioner Jonathan Adelstein stated \"if broadcasters and cable TV companies insist on further commercializing new and other shows alike, that is their business. But if they do so without disclosing it to the viewing public, that is payola, and that is the FCC's business.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom, placement by commercial broadcasters was forbidden prior to 2011. On February 28, 2011, telecommunications regulator Ofcom legalised placements in certain types of programming. A placement must be \"editorially justified\" and not place \"undue prominence\" on the product. Product placements are not allowed for products that cannot legally be advertised on television, including alcohol, baby milk, gambling products, medication or junk food. Placements are not allowed during children's, news, public affairs and religious programs. Additionally, broadcasters must disclose placements on-air by displaying a \"PP\" icon on-screen during the program for at least three seconds at the beginning, after every commercial break, and at the end. The first legal product placement on British television came during an episode of \"This Morning\", for a Nestlé-produced coffee maker. As with all other advertising, the BBC is barred from using placements on its publicly funded services.\n\n\"I, Robot\" offers placements for Converse, Ovaltine, Audi, FedEx, Dos Equis and JVC among others, all of them introduced within the film's first ten minutes. One moment includes a straightforward advertisement where Will Smith's character responds to a compliment about his shoes, to which he replies \"Converse All-Stars, vintage 2004\" (the year of the film's release). Audi created a special car for the film, the Audi RSQ. Surveys conducted in the US showed that the placements boosted the brand's image. The Audi RSQ appears for nine minutes, and other Audis also appear in the film. \"I, Robot\" was ranked \"the worst film for product placement\" on a British site.\n\n\"Demolition Man\" makes heavy mention of the only remaining restaurant chain being Taco Bell (in the U.S. release) or Pizza Hut (in the European release).\n\n\"The Island\" features at least 35 individual products or brands, including cars, bottled water, shoes, credit cards, beer, ice cream, and a web search engine. In the movie's DVD Commentary track, director Michael Bay claims he added the advertisements for greater realism.\n\nThe 2006 comedy film \"\" parodied the large amount of sponsorship in NASCAR. For example, Ricky Bobby thanks baby Jesus for certain products during the dinner blessings, due to contractual obligations. In one race, he drives his car with a giant Fig Newtons sticker on his windshield, which obscures his vision. A scene where Ricky's and Jean Girard's cars go flipping for an excessively long time is interrupted by an Applebee's commercial (referencing NBC's use of commercial breaks during its own coverage). The character Jean Girard, a cultured French driver, is appropriately sponsored by Perrier mineral water.\n\n\"Josie and the Pussycats\" contains placements in most of the shots. This appears to be done ironically, as the plot of the film revolves around subliminal messages in advertising. The film's general message can also be construed as an anti-consumerist one. The film neither sought nor received compensation for the placements.\n\nThe 2009 \"Star Trek\", in a scene where young James Kirk drives and crashes a Chevrolet Corvette, he operates a Nokia touch-screen smartphone. Before running the car off the cliff while being chased by a hovering motorcycle cop, the distinct Nokia trademark ring tone can be heard. The Finnish phone maker offered \"Star Trek\" apps for its phones. The use of contemporary products was ridiculed, as the scene is set in the year 2255.\n\nThe 2013 Filipino film \"My Little Bossings\" attracted criticism for its extensive use of product placement. Reviewers panned the film for being \"one long commercial\", where advertisements for brands endorsed by the characters' actors are frequently interspersed into the film. Zig Marasigan of \"Rappler\" described the film's use of product endorsements as \"some of the most distasteful examples of local product placement while no effort is made to weave them into the narrative.\"\n\nIn a similar vein to early radio and television programs, sponsored programs in the Philippines are not uncommon, where children's programs like \"Tropang Potchi\" and \"Jollitown\" were produced on behalf of companies, prominently featuring products and related properties in the shows in question.\n\nIn April 2009, fans of the television series \"Chuck\" responded to a placement by Subway restaurants with a grassroots effort to save the show from cancellation. The movement gained support from cast and crew, with series star Zachary Levi leading hundreds of fans to a Subway restaurant in Birmingham, United Kingdom.\n\nPlacement continues to grow, despite consumer groups such as Commercial Alert that object to the practise as \"an affront to basic honesty\". The group requested disclosure of all product-placement arrangements and notification before and during embedded advertisements. It justifies this to allow parents to protect easily influenced children.\n\nIn 2005, the Writers Guild of America, a trade union representing authors of television scripts, objected that its members were forced to produce disguised ad copy.\n\nSome scholars argue that product placement may inherently affect the creativity and originality of movies as film producers may re-write scripts in order to incorporate products. Most typically, product placement and merchandise are most successful amongst specific genres of movies which may eventually limit the diversity of films.\n\nAs with most marketing tactics, product placement leads to explicit as well as implicit advertising effects. Explicit effects can be observed directly and are usually visible by higher recall scores. They are highly connected to the conscious mind. Implicit effects can be observed by a change in behavior – like a higher purchase intention. They are fully based on the subconscious mind. Implicit effects are more relevant for purchase decisions and therefore more valuable than explicit reactions.\n\nRecall describes whether people can name a product after seeing it within the content. Research showed that there is a significant relationship between product placement and recall.\n\nProduct placement also leads to changes in attitude towards the product or brand.\n\nA lot of research has shown a higher purchase intention as a result of product placement.\n\nProduct placement affects the audience on a conscious, but also subconscious level. Science showed that there does not even need to be an explicit, conscious effect to activate subconscious effects. For example, product placement can lead to an exclusion of competing brands from the consideration set of the audience – subconsciously. It is also hoped to bypass advertising defense reactions of consumers by focusing on the subconscious character of product placement.\n\nUnder specific circumstances, product placement can lead to no or even negative effects. This usually happens if the product placement is too obvious, while the audience also feels it is being manipulated.\n\nThe better the product placement fits the surrounding content, the better the implicit effectiveness (like attitude or purchase-intention) will be.\n\nAfter viewing a \"Seinfeld\" episode with visual, auditory and audiovisual product placements, a recall task indicated that audiovisual product placements were recalled the best, visual product placements somewhat less and audio placements least. In a recognition test audiovisual was still remembered the best but audio placements were remembered second best and visual placements were remembered third best. As indicated, the type of placement that is most effective seems to vary depending on task, but audiovisual placements seem to be often the most effective. However, audiovisual product placements are not remembered best when there is more than one audiovisual placement at once, making it hard to remember each one. In case the placement is only on the audio level, advertisers must make sure it is very prominent to have any effect at all.\n\nPeople tended to like brand names that were paired with attractive faces more than those paired with unattractive faces. The more times a brand was paired with an attractive face, the more people liked it.\n\nProduct placement perceived to disrupt a movie, especially when repeated, were found in one study to be counterproductive. Moderate repetition of subtle product placements did not increase people's feelings of distraction.\n\nProducts that are integrated within the plot of a movie are better recall, although not if more than one product is shown at a time. In one study placements connected to the story were recognized most often, products used by the main character were remembered less often and products in the background were remembered least often.\n\nPlacements were found more effective on a larger screen compared to on a smaller one. Also, products placed in the first half of a movie tend to be remembered better than products in the second half of a movie, which demonstrates the primacy effect.\n\nHigh involvement with the program makes it easier for people to recognize the product placement. This can lead to positive effects, but might also lead to negative reactions. The same applies for high product category involvement.\n\nOlder research cited a difference between different cultural areas. For example, Australians, Austrians. and Germans tended to evaluate product placement more critically and show less positive reactions than Americans or people from certain Asian countries such as India.\n\nChildren are usually more easily influenced than adults.\n\nIf the product is endorsed by a person, there are stronger priming effects if the audience is the same sex. Women tend to be influenced a little easier, but show more negative reactions when the product can be described as ethically questionable (e.g. alcohol).\n\nTo measure the success of product placement, one first tracks the parameters of the placement itself, like the ease of identification, screen time, number of exposure(s), or association with a main character. That information is also often used to determine the price of a specific placement. Secondly, the effectiveness is measured using direct (for explicit memory effects) as well as indirect (for implicit memory effects) measurements.\n\nExplicit effects are measured by recall or recognition tests. Subjects are asked to name the products that he or she noticed (free recall). This survey can be also aided by giving additional information like a specific product category. At recognition tests, a selection of products is shown to the interviewed person, who then needs to select the ones that he has seen before.\n\nImplicit effects are measured in an indirect way by observing a change in behavior. This can be done by tracking the consideration set and buying behavior of people, measuring brain activities or using abstract indirect test settings like the word fragment or word stem completion test. The implicit association test (IAT) is also an applicable measurement tool.\n\nMany argue that product placement is ethically questionable, because it manipulates people against their will. A contrary view is, even if product placement is only perceived unconsciously, it is still evaluated by our mind. It cannot make people act against their beliefs. Most people also appreciate the fact that movies look more realistic with real brands and do not feel disturbed by the placements. Additionally, further research argues that product placement is not any different from other marketing tactics when it comes to ethics.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17827120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17827120", "title": "Relative articulation", "text": "Relative articulation\n\nIn phonetics and phonology, relative articulation is description of the manner and place of articulation of a speech sound relative to some reference point. Typically, the comparison is made with a default, unmarked articulation of the same phoneme in a neutral sound environment. For example, the English velar consonant is \"fronted\" before the vowel (as in \"keep\") compared to articulation of before other vowels (as in \"cool\"). This fronting is called palatalization.\n\nThe relative position of a sound may be described as \"advanced\" (\"fronted\"), \"retracted\" (\"backed\"), \"raised\", \"lowered\", \"centralized\", or \"mid-centralized\". The latter two terms are only used with vowels, and are marked in the International Phonetic Alphabet with diacritics over the vowel letter. The others are used with both consonants and vowels, and are marked with iconic diacritics under the letter. Another dimension of relative articulation that has IPA diacritics is the degree of roundedness, \"more rounded\" and \"less rounded\".\n\nAn advanced or fronted sound is one that is pronounced farther to the front of the vocal tract than some reference point. The diacritic for this in the IPA is the subscript plus, . Conversely, a retracted or backed sound is one that is pronounced farther to the back of the vocal tract, and its IPA diacritic is the subscript minus . When there is no room for the sign under a letter, it may be written after, using: as in , or as in .\n\nBoth vowels and consonants may be fronted or backed. In verbal description, the prefix \"pre-\" may be used to indicate fronting, especially in the terms \"prepalatal\" and \"prevelar\". Otherwise phrases like \"fronted u\" may be used. For retraction, either the prefix \"post-\" may be used to indicate retraction, as above, or phrases like \"retracted i\" may be used.\n\nIn English, the back vowel is farther forward than what is normally indicated by the IPA letter . This fronting may be shown explicitly, especially within a narrow transcription: . Whether this is as far front as the central vowel , or somewhere between and , may need to be clarified verbally, or on a vowel diagram.\n\nThe difference between a fronted and non-fronted consonant can be heard in the English words \"key\" and \"coo\" , where the in \"key\" is fronted under the influence of the front vowel . In English, the plosive in the affricate , as in the word \"church\", is farther back than an alveolar due to assimilation with the postalveolar fricative . In narrow transcription, may be transcribed . In General American English, the in the word \"eighth\" is farther front than normal, due to assimilation with the interdental consonant , and may be transcribed as . \n\nLanguages may have phonemes that are farther back than the nearest IPA symbol. For example, Polish \"sz\" is a postalveolar sibilant. While this is often transcribed as , it is not \"domed\" (partially palatalized) the way a prototypical is. A more precise transcription is therefore . Similarly, the velar consonants in Kwakiutl are actually \"postvelar\"; that is, pronounced farther back than a prototypical velar, between velar and uvular , and is thus transcribed .\n\nOfficially, the IPA symbol stands for the open front unrounded vowel. However, in most languages where it is used, actually stands for the central, rather than the front vowel. If precision is desired, this may also be indicated with the minus sign , although a number of other transcription are also possible.\n\nA raised sound is articulated with the tongue or lip raised higher than some reference point. In the IPA this is indicated with the \"uptack\" diacritic .\n\nA lowered sound is articulated with the tongue or lip lowered (the mouth more open) than some reference point. In the IPA this is indicated with the \"downtack\" diacritic . Both consonants and vowels may be marked as raised or lowered.\n\nWhen there is no room for the tack under a letter, it may be written after, using: as in , or as in .\n\nIn the case of a vowel, raising means that the vowel is \"closer,\" toward the top of the vowel chart. For example, represents a vowel somewhere between cardinal and , or may even be . Lowering, on the other hand, means that the vowel is \"more open,\" toward the bottom of the chart. For example, represents a vowel somewhere between cardinal and , or may even be .\n\nIn other non-IPA transcription systems, raised vowels are indicated with the iconic upward-pointing arrowhead while lowered vowels have the downward arrowhead . Thus, IPA is equivalent to [e˰], IPA is equivalent to [e˯].\n\nWith consonants, raising and lowering changes the manner of articulation to something with more or less stricture. For example, raised approximants and trills are fricatives, whereas lowered fricatives are approximants. The ambiguous symbols for rear approximant/fricatives may be specified as fricatives with the raising diacritic, , or as approximants with the lowering diacritic, . In Spanish, the lenited allophones of the voiced stops are generally transcribed as fricatives even though they are approximants, or intermediate between fricative and approximant. This may be partially due to the fact there is only a dedicated IPA symbol for one of them, the velar approximant. More precise transcription will use the fricative symbols with the lowering diacritic, (the last symbol may be rendered as , but that may not display properly in some browsers). Czech, on the other hand, requires the opposite: Its fricated trill, which is a separate phoneme, may be transcribed as a raised trill, . Similarly, the non-sibilant coronal fricative is written , and the voiceless velar lateral fricative as . (A dedicated letter for this sound, , is not part of the IPA.)\n\nFrom most open (least stricture) to most close (most stricture), there are several independent relationships among speech sounds. \"Open vowel → mid vowel → close vowel → approximant → fricative → plosive\" is one; \"flap → stop\" is another; and \"trill → trilled fricative\" yet another. The IPA chart has been organized so that the raising diacritic moves the value of a letter through these series toward the top of the chart, and the lowering diacritic toward the bottom of the chart, but this only works for some of the consonants. While it would be convenient if all consonants could be so ordered, consonants are too diverse for a single dimension to capture their relationships. In addition, many of the points along the series may be nasalized or lateralized as well, and these parameters are independent of stricture.\n\nA centralized vowel is a vowel that is more central than some point of reference, or that has undergone a shift in this direction. The diacritic for this in the International Phonetic Alphabet is the dieresis, .\n\nFor example, to transcribe rounded and unrounded near-close central vowels, the symbols may be used.\n\nIn other (non-IPA) transcription systems, (or ) will be seen instead of (by analogy with ). Before the letters were added to the IPA in 1993, the symbols were used for these near-schwa values. would now be assumed to represent articulations intermediate between and . Similarly, would be intermediate between and .\n\nHowever, since the IPA does not specify the exact amount of centralization that centralized vowels have, the symbols and can in modern transcriptions be at times used to transcribe fully central vowels, or vowels that have a variable amount of centralization.\n\nIn the majority of languages described as having an (which denotes a front vowel), the vowel is actually central and therefore a more narrow transcription of it is . However, this symbol is not commonly used mainly because of the common practice of avoiding using diacritics wherever possible, and because very few languages contrast front and central open unrounded vowels.\n\nInstead of the diacritic for centralization, the advanced or retracted diacritics may be used (an equivalent transcription of is retracted ), but the concept of centralization is convenient in cases where front and back vowels move toward each other, rather than all advancing or retracting in the same direction.\n\nWhen a transcription system uses \"both\" the centralized and the advanced/retracted diacritics, generally the former indicates a more central vowel, so that e.g. indicates an only slightly centralized (retracted) front vowel , whereas indicates a more centralized (retracted) front vowel, or even a fully central vowel (which, as stated above, has a dedicated IPA symbol ).\n\nSemivowels can be centralized much like vowels; for instance, the semivowels corresponding to the close central vowels can be written as centralized palatal semivowels , or centralized velar semivowels . The transcription vs. may also denote a distinction in the type of rounding, with the former symbol denoting a semivowel with compressed rounding typical of front vowels, and the latter symbol denoting a semivowel with protruded rounding typical of central and back vowels, though an additional verbal clarification is usual in such cases, as the IPA does not provide any official means to distinguish sounds with compressed and protruded rounding.\n\nMid-centralized vowels are closer to the midpoint of the vowel space than their referent vowels. That is, they are closer to the mid-central vowel schwa not just by means of centralization, but also by raising or lowering. The diacritic used to mark this in the International Phonetic Alphabet is the over-cross, .\n\nIn most languages, vowels become mid-centralized when spoken quickly, and in some, such as English and Russian, many vowels are also mid-centralized when unstressed. This is a general characteristic of vowel reduction.\n\nEven when fully articulated, the vowels of a language may be on the schwa side of a cardinal IPA vowel. One example of this is Lisbon Portuguese, where unstressed \"e\" is a near-close near-back unrounded vowel. That is, it lies between the close back unrounded vowel and schwa, where sits in the vowel chart, but unlike , is not rounded. It may be written , as in \"pegar\" \"to hold\", though such a fully narrow transcription is rarely used, with symbols , or even being the usual broader transcriptions.\n\nThere are also diacritics, respectively and , to indicate greater or lesser degrees of rounding. For example, the English often has very little rounding, and may be transcribed . In Assamese, on the other hand, the open back rounded vowel is much more rounded than is typical for a low vowel, and may be transcribed .\n\nThese diacritics are sometimes also used with consonants to indicate degrees of labialization. For example, in the Athabaskan language Hupa, voiceless velar fricatives distinguish three degrees of labialization, transcribed either or .\n\nThe Extensions to the IPA have two additional symbols for degrees of rounding: spread, as in , and open-rounded (), as in English and .\n\nMany sound changes involve changes in place of articulation:\n\n"}

They are usually in a different order each time. However, they are not completely shuffled, so as to avoid varying the time between any two consecutive plays of a given song by either too much or too little. When measuring airplay, the number of times a song is played is counted as spins.\n\nStations playing new music typically have a short rotation of around four hours, while stations playing \"classics\" may go as long as eight hours. College radio and indie radio stations sometimes have no particular rotation, only the music director's suggested lists for the disc jockeys, or are totally freeform radio. Broadcast automation systems handle a limited rotation quite well, in turn making voice tracking easy. Even if a live person is present, the automation system at commercial stations usually picks the music ahead of time out of the current rotation, thus the DJ becomes only an announcer.\n\nHeavy rotation or power rotation is a list of songs that get the most airplay on a radio station. Songs in heavy rotation will be played many times in a 24-hour period. A reason for playing the same song more than once a day is that many listeners tune in expecting to hear their favorite song, and most listeners don't listen to the radio for extended periods of time. Prolonged listening to a station that places songs in heavy rotation can quickly become unpleasant; such stations are not well-suited for retail environments, where employees must listen for hours on end, and doing so can breed contempt for the music and create a hostile work environment.\n\nA song placed in \"lunar rotation\" is one that is only played in off-peak hours, usually late at night. There can be various reasons for this, but such songs are usually not hits and are played because of the personal musical preference of the DJ or programmer, to avoid more stringent daypart-based regulations on music content or to fulfill a broadcasting obligation such as Canadian content quotas. (See also \"beaver hour\".)\n\nRecurrent rotation refers to a group of songs still frequently aired on a contemporary hit radio station several months or even years after the initial debut. It is also used to describe core songs in other radio formats as well. Most charts have special rules to determine when a song has become recurrent, at which point they are removed from current charts (such as the \"Billboard\" Hot 100) and placed on special \"recurrent charts\". Recurrent charts tend to be more static, with fewer week-to-week changes in popularity than current charts.\n\nThe \"Billboard\" charts include these lists:\n\n\nSongs that survive in recurrent rotation typically form the basis of radio formats as years advance. A hit song that is left out of recurrent rotation will eventually become known as a \"forgotten 45\", a name derived from the fact that singles used to be released on 45 RPM records.\n"}

A standard statement of the paradox is that a cursively written word cannot be recognized without being segmented and cannot be segmented without being recognized. The paradox was first articulated in a 1973 publication by Kenneth M. Sayre, after whom it was named.\n\nIt is relatively easy to design automated systems capable of recognizing words inscribed in a printed format. Such words are segmented into letters by the very act of writing them on the page. Given templates matching typical letter shapes in a given language, individual letters can be identified with a high degree of probability. In cases of ambiguity, probable letter sequences can be compared with a selection of properly spelled words in that language (called a lexicon). If necessary, syntactic features of the language can be applied to render a generally accurate identification of the words in question. Printed-character recognition systems of this sort are commonly used in processing standardized government forms, in sorting mail by zip code, and so forth.\n\nIn cursive writing, however, letters comprising a given word typically flow sequentially without gaps between them. Unlike a sequence of printed letters, cursively connected letters are not segmented in advance. Here is where Sayre’s Paradox comes into play. Unless the word is already segmented into letters, template-matching techniques like those described above cannot be applied. Prior segmentation, that is to say, is necessary for word recognition. On the other hand, there are no reliable techniques for segmenting a word into letters unless the word itself has been previously identified. Word recognition requires letter segmentation, and letter segmentation requires word recognition. There is no way a cursive writing recognition system employing standard template-matching techniques can do both simultaneously.\n\nAdvantages to be gained by use of automated cursive writing recognition systems include routing mail with handwritten addresses, reading handwritten bank checks, and automated digitalization of hand-written documents. These are practical incentives for finding ways of circumventing Sayre’s Paradox.\n\nOne way of ameliorating the adverse effects of the paradox is to normalize the word inscriptions to be recognized. Normalization amounts to eliminating idiosyncrasies in the penmanship of the writer, such as unusual slope of the letters and unusual slant of the cursive line. This procedure can increase the probability of a correct match with a letter template, resulting in an incremental improvement in the success rate of the system. Since improvement of this sort still depends on accurate segmentation, however, it remains subject to the limitations of Sayre’s Paradox. Researchers have come to realize that the only way to circumvent the paradox is by use of procedures that do not rely on accurate segmentation.\n\nSegmentation is accurate to the extent that it matches distinctions among letters in the actual inscriptions presented to the system for recognition (the input data). This is sometimes referred to as “explicit segmentation”. “Implicit segmentation,” by contrast, is division of the cursive line into more parts than the number of actual letters in the cursive line itself. Processing these “implicit parts” to achieve eventual word identification requires specific statistical procedures involving Hidden Markov Models (HMM).\n\nA Markov model is a statistical representation of a random process, which is to say a process in which future states are independent of states occurring before the present. In such a process, a given state is dependent only on the conditional probability of its following the state immediately before it. An example is a series of outcomes from successive casts of a die. An HMM is a Markov model, individual states of which are not fully known. Conditional probabilities between states are still determinate, but the identities of individual states are not fully disclosed.\n\nRecognition proceeds by matching HMMs of words to be recognized with previously prepared HMMs of words in the lexicon. The best match in a given case is taken to indicate the identity of the handwritten word in question. As with systems based on explicit segmentation, automated recognition systems based on implicit segmentation are judged more or less successful according to the percentage of correct identifications they accomplish.\n\nInstead of explicit segmentation techniques, most automated handwriting recognition systems today employ implicit segmentation in conjunction with HMM-based matching procedures. The constraints epitomized by Sayre’s Paradox are largely responsible for this shift in approach.\n\n"}

While serving as chief of the Great General Staff of the Prussian Army, Moltke took his subordinates on riding tours of areas where, in the event of war, significant military events (such as battles or the deployment of large numbers of troops) were likely to occur. These exercises served the double purpose of training staff officers to appreciate the operational and strategic significance of particular pieces of terrain and informing contingency planning. The term \"staff\" refers to the fact that participants in these exercises were originally members of the Great General Staff.\n\nThe Prussian staff ride evolved to an intermediate stage between table-top war games and army maneuvers. In this expanded form of staff rides, the commanding officers and staffs would deploy in the field as if at war, but without troops, with 'teams' for both sides. Reconnaissance and movement orders were given to umpires, who decided what units would be sighted or encountered, and when, passing the information back to the commanders and staffs. The exercise thus allowed the commanders to war game more realistically than on a table top. Critiques would take place at the conclusion of the staff rides. As an example, the Battle of Tannenberg was largely anticipated in one of Alfred von Schlieffen's pre-war staff rides. \n\nThe Leavenworth staff ride was introduced by Major Eben Swift of the US Army, while he was serving as assistant commandant of the General Service and Staff School (today's Command and General Staff College) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Like the classic staff ride, the Leavenworth staff ride was originally conducted on horseback. However, rather than studying the role that a particular piece of ground might play in a future conflict, the participants in a Leavenworth staff ride studied the ground associated with a battle or campaign that took place at some point in the past.\n\nThe staff rides conducted by Major Swift were invariably those of the American Civil War. For example, in 1906, Major Swift led a group of twelve students on a staff ride to the site of the Battle of Chickamauga.\n\nIn the 1970s, the United States Army revived the staff ride, replacing horses with buses and automobiles; expanding the range of battles and operations studied well beyond those of the American Civil War; and extending the opportunity to participate to soldiers of all ranks and specialties.\n\nIn some instances, the Leavenworth staff ride consists of a guided tour of the battlefield, with explanations provided by military historians, park rangers, or others with expertise on the events in question. In other instances, each participant is assigned the task of explaining the events of a particular time and place to the other participants.\nSince that time, army schools have used staff rides to enhance professional military education and training. It began at CGSC and has continued at the War College and the various officer schools; however, staff riding is not limited to officers. Indeed, Non-commissioned officers, too, find the process useful to understand higher level decision-making, military tactics, and leadership; they also benefit from a historical view of training.\n\nA staff ride differs from a guided battlefield tour:\n\nA properly conducted staff ride consists of three phases: \n\n\nAlso known as an \"on-site decision-forcing case\" or a \"Quantico-style staff ride\", a decision-forcing staff ride is a decision-forcing case conducted in the places where the decisions at the heart of the case were made. That place could be a historic building, a scenic overlook, or a ship that has been turned into a museum. In most instances, however, it is a portion of a battlefield that has been preserved.\n\n"}

{"id": "6230928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6230928", "title": "Syldavian", "text": "Syldavian\n\nSyldavian is a fictional West Germanic language created by Hergé as the national language of Syldavia, a small fictional Balkan kingdom that serves as a major setting in many of \"The Adventures of Tintin\" stories. Hergé modeled the language on Marols, a dialect of Dutch spoken in and around Brussels. The entire corpus of the language has been analyzed by Mark Rosenfelder.\n\nAs presented in the Tintin books, Syldavian has a superficial resemblance to certain Central European languages, particularly Polish and Hungarian, due to its orthography. Like Serbian, it uses both Cyrillic and Latin script, although apparently in somewhat different contexts; it is most commonly written in the Cyrillic alphabet, albeit with the Latin alphabet by the royal court. It shares numerous orthographic features found in various Eastern European languages, most notably the \"sz\" and \"cz\" of Polish.\n\nHowever, the language is clearly a Germanic language. Its vocabulary and grammar resembles that of Dutch and German and has little in common with any Slavic languages. But while Marols, Hergé's native dialect, was used as a basis for the language, Syldavian has a much more complicated grammar, with other Central European influences added. (Indeed, it is easy to imagine that if Hergé was, say, Italian, Syldavian would have ended up like Romanian.)\n\nThe language also appears to have been influenced by Bordurian (another fictional language), Slavic languages and Turkish. The Syldavians often bear names of Slavic origin, such as Wladimir; the dish \"szlaszeck\" that Tintin encountered also appears to be a borrowing (\"szaszłyk\" is the Polish word for \"shish kebab\", borrowed in turn from Turkish). Many words are based on common French slangs. For examples, \"klebcz\" is constructed on the French Parisian slang \"clebs\" meaning \"dog\".\n\nThis language, which is Germanic but bears a great resemblance to Polish, may be likened to the artificial Romance language Wenedyk, or to the endangered Wymysorys language.\n\nSyldavian boasts a rich range of sounds.\n\nIn addition to the diacritical marks shown in the chart below, there are acute and grave accents that may indicate stress.\n\n\"Roman letters are on the left, Cyrillic letters on the right.\"\nIn addition to these letters, Syldavian also contains several digraphs and letters for which the pronunciation is uncertain:\n\n\"Roman letters are on the left, Cyrillic letters on the right.\"\nNote: As in Czech, the letter can be syllabic, as seen in names such as \"Staszrvitch\" and \"Dbrnouk\".\n\nThere are some additional digraphs and trigraphs, including (used in names and pronounced with , the apparent Syldavian version of the common Serbo-Croatian/Balkan surname ending \"-ić\"), (uncertain, but may be an alternative form of ), and . These demonstrate that the Latin-based orthography has a number of irregularities, or else these are old inconsistent spellings that have been preserved in family names but are no longer used in the standard orthography (as in Hungarian, where for example one may find the family name \"Széchenyi\" retaining a traditional spelling rather than the orthographically correct *\"Szécsenyi\").\n\nNote that Syldavian Cyrillic diverges in some important respects from Cyrillic as used in real-world languages, most notably by porting over Latin digraphs into the Cyrillic alphabet (for example, /ʃ/ is written \"сз\" instead of \"ш\"), and to use a few Cyrillic letters (щ, ю) for sounds for which they are never used in the real world. This, together with the use of Latin script in old medieval manuscripts, may suggest that the Syldavians adopted the Latin alphabet first, and the Cyrillic later, which is the reverse of several real-world languages (most notably Romanian) which switched from Cyrillic to Latin.\n\n\nUnlike Marols, but like German (shown in \"italics\" in the table), Syldavian definite articles are extensively inflected.\n\nAdjectives precede nouns:\n\nThere is no sufficient evidence to tell whether adjectives change form. The rules of Dutch, a control language of Syldavian, are very complex.\n\nNote: the derivation Klow > Klowaswa is merely one of many adjectivizations, however, compare Zyldav 'Syldavian'\n\nAdjectives can be used to modify verbs like adverbs:\n\n3rd person singular neuter objective and possessive and 2nd person plural pronouns are reconstructed based on Dutch and German.\n\nczei - this<br>\ntot - that\n\nVerbs are either weak or strong. This decides how they are conjugated.\n\nStrong Verb: \"blavn\" 'to stay'\n\nWeak Verb: \"löwn\" 'to love'\n\n\nTo negate a sentence, the particle \"nietz\" is placed after the subject, in auxiliary position.\n\nIn copulative sentences, \"nietz\" is placed after the verb (or \"czesztot\") :\n\nMost adverbs tend to be identical to adjectives in form. Adverbs can be used to modify verbs:\n\n\"szplug\" - a curse word, perhaps equivalent to \"damn\". (Not found in original French edition, only English translation.)\n\n\"szplitz on szplug\"- a more extreme form of szplug\n\n\"hamaïh!\"- praising or surprise, could be something like \"hail!\" or \"wow!\"\n\n\"hält!\"- a command, probably meaning \"stop!\" or \"halt!\"\n\n\"szcht!\"- another command, sounds almost like \"shh!\" and perhaps means \"silence!\"\n\n\"zsálu\"- a greeting, probably \"salute\" or \"hello\".\n\nThe verb normally follows the object:\n\nWhere there's an auxiliary and a main verb, the main verb remains at the end, and the auxiliary verb moves just after the subject:\n\nIn earlier Syldavian the pronoun may follow the verb, and this form may still be used for emphasis:\n\nYou can say either Eihn ben ek, Eihn bennek or Ek ben eihn, but never *Eihn ek ben (unlike English, where you can say 'Here I am'). In general \"X is Y\" can be inverted to \"Y is X\". When X is a pronoun, the inversion adds some emphasis:\n\nIn the \"kzommet\" sentences in the corpus, prepositional phrases follow the verb. The comma, however, is a signal that the prepositional phrase has been moved for emphasis, or because it is an afterthought:\n\nForms of 'be' directly follow the subject :\n\nThe merged form \"czesztot\" 'it is, that is' begins a sentence: \"Czesztot Tintin\". \"That's Tintin.\"\n\nSamples of Syldavian from only two periods - the 14th century and the 20th century - are available to us. But even with such a small sample, some changes can be seen in the language over a 600-year period:\n\n\nFrom a 14th-century manuscript, \"Noble Deeds of Ottokar IV\":\n\nMedieval Spelling\n\nModern Spelling\n\nCyrillic Spelling\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nMore Examples\n\n\n"}

This includes electromechanical split-flap displays, vane displays, and flip-disc displays; all-electronic liquid-crystal displays, incandescent eggcrate displays, LED displays, and vacuum fluorescent displays; and even electric nixie tubes.\n\nThere are several ways to form text for display. A segment display uses lines, while a dot-matrix display uses a grid of dots, and both of these are seen in LCD, LED, VFD, and vane/disc types. For split-flap displays, the characters or words are pre-printed, and for nixie tubes the shapes are also pre-formed. In any case, the display elements are controlled by electronics which activate them in the correct physical and temporal sequence to show the desired information.\n\nText displays are used in everything from clocks (clock radios, wristwatches) to variable-message signs (departure boards, intelligent transportation systems), because until the late 2000s, they were (and in many cases still are) the least expensive for their purpose.\n\nLED text displays refer to types that are specialized and limited to display of alpha-numeric characters. Most types display either one character or a group of characters. One character is generally displayed by a matrix of LEDs, or by a set of segments.\n\nA liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat panel display, electronic visual display, video display that uses the light modulating or polarizing properties of liquid crystals (LCs). LCs do not emit light directly. A character display type is limited to and specialized for display of alphanumeric characters.\n\nThey are used in a wide range of applications, including computer monitors, television, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, signage, etc. They are common in consumer devices such as video players, gaming devices, clocks, watches, calculators, and telephones.\n\nThe low electrical power consumption of LCDs enables them to be used in battery-powered electronic equipment. It is an electronically modulated optical device made up of any number of pixels filled with liquid crystals and arrayed in front of a light source (backlight) or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome. The earliest discovery leading to the development of LCD technology, the discovery of liquid crystals, dates from 1888.\nBy 2008, worldwide sales of televisions with LCD screens had surpassed the sale of CRT units.\n\nAn eggcrate display is one older method of displaying an alphanumeric character. It consists of a matrix of incandescent light bulbs. A foam rubber mask with an array of holes surrounding the bulbs is attached to the display, causing it to resemble an egg crate.\n\nSome eggcrate displays use a complete 5×7 matrix for each digit, permitting the display of nearly all alphanumeric characters. Other types display only numeric characters and optionally a dollar sign. This type of eggcrate display is popularly used for sports scoreboards.\n\nEggcrate displays have been used on many game shows to display contestants' scores and/or for countdown clocks because other types of displays, such as LED seven-segment displays, were prone to being washed out by bright studio lights. Though they continued to see extensive use well into the late 1990s, many shows began adopting LCDs in the 2000s. They have also been used as variable-message signs on highways, although they were later superseded by flip-disc, fiber optic, and eventually LED displays.\n\nA vane display is an electro-mechanical type of 7-segment display. Unlike LED and VFD segmented displays, vane displays are composed of seven physical surfaces, typically painted white, but occasionally other colors, such as yellow or fluorescent green. If a segment is to be displayed as \"off\", it will be rotated so that its edge faces forward, with the painted surface pointing away and not visible. A segment that is to be displayed as \"on\" will be rotated so that the painted surface is shown.\n\n"}

{"id": "16352437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16352437", "title": "Unicode input", "text": "Unicode input\n\nUnicode input is the insertion of a specific Unicode character on a computer by a user; it is a common way to input characters not directly supported by a physical keyboard. Unicode characters can be produced either by selecting them from a display or by typing a certain sequence of keys on a physical keyboard. In addition, a character produced by one of these methods in one web page or document can be copied into another. Unicode is similar to ASCII but provides many more options and encodes many more signs.\n\nA Unicode input system needs to provide a large repertoire of characters, ideally all valid Unicode code points. This is different from a keyboard layout which defines keys and their combinations only for a limited number of characters appropriate for a certain locale.\nUnicode characters are distinguished by code points, which are conventionally represented by \"U+\" followed by four or five hexadecimal digits, for example U+00AE or U+1D310. Characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), containing modern scripts – including many Chinese and Japanese characters – and many symbols, have a 4-digit code. Historic scripts, but also many modern symbols and pictographs (such as emoticons, playing cards and many CJK characters) have 5-digit codes.\n\nAn application can display a character only if it can access a font which contains a glyph for the character. Very few fonts have full Unicode coverage; most only contain the glyphs needed to support a few writing systems. However, most modern browsers and other text-processing applications are able to display multilingual content because they perform font substitution, automatically switching to a fallback font when necessary to display characters which are not supported in the current font. Which fonts are used for fallback and the thoroughness of Unicode coverage varies by software and operating system; some software will search for a suitable glyph in all of the installed fonts, others only search within certain fonts.\n\nIf an application does not have access to a font supporting a character, the character will usually be shown as a question mark or another generic replacement character, e.g. � or  ⃞ .\n\nMany systems provide a way to select Unicode characters visually. ISO/IEC 14755 refers to this as a \"screen-selection entry method\".\n\nMicrosoft Windows has provided a Unicode version of the Character Map program, appearing in the consumer edition since XP. This is limited to characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). Characters are searchable by Unicode character name, and the table can be limited to a particular code block.\n\nMore advanced third-party tools of the same type are also available (a notable freeware example is BabelMap, which supports all Unicode characters).\n\nIn macOS the \"Emoji & Symbols\" () menu can be found in the Edit menu in many programs. This brings up the Characters palette allowing the user to choose any character from a variety of views. The user can also search for the character or Unicode plane by name.\n\nOn most Linux desktop environments, equivalent tools – such as gucharmap (GNOME) or kcharselect (KDE) – are available.\n\nIn some applications on Microsoft Windows, particularly those using the RichEdit control, decimal Unicode code points (for example, 256 for U+0100) are supported with Alt codes. \n\nThe text editor Vim allows characters to be specified by two-character mnemonics (confusingly called \"digraphs\" by Vim developers). The installed set can be augmented by custom mnemonics defined for arbitrary code points, specified in decimal. For example, as decimal 9881 is equal to hexadecimal 2699, associates \"Gr\" with .\n\nClause 5.1 of ISO/IEC 14755 describes a \"Basic method\" whereby a \"beginning sequence\" is followed by the hex number representation of the code point and the \"ending sequence\". On some systems, this is limited to the BMP (characters up to U+FFFF).\n\nIn order to enable a universal (independent of language settings) input method in Windows, one can add a string type (REG_SZ) value called codice_1 to the registry key codice_2 and assign the value data codice_3 to it. Users need to log off/in on Windows 8.1/8.0, Windows 7, and Vista or reboot on earlier systems after editing the registry for this input method to start working.\nUnicode characters can then be entered by holding down , pressing the on the numeric keypad, followed by the hexadecimal code – using the numeric keypad for digits from 0 to 9 and letter keys for A to F digits – and then releasing . This may not work for 5-digit hexadecimal codes like U+1F937.\n\nIf one prefers not to edit the registry or if, as on many laptops, the numeric keypad is unavailable, the utility UnicodeInput can be downloaded. If one invokes this program when typing text, the window shown on the right appears; entering the hexadecimal value and pressing then produces the desired character and makes the window disappear.\n\nAutoHotkey scripts support substitution of Unicode characters for keystrokes. For example, the command codice_4 will insert an em dash in a text field in the active window.\n\nSome individual Windows programs or apps already support the input of Unicode. For instance, WordPad and LibreOffice programs (Writer, Calc, etc.) support the following input method: one first enters the character’s hexadecimal code (between two and six hexadecimal digits), then immediately presses . For example, entering codice_5 and then pressing the combination will produce the character ñ. Unless it is six hexadecimal digits long, the code must not be preceded by any digit or letters a–f as they will be treated as part of the code to be converted. For example, entering codice_6 followed by will produce ૱ (U+0AF1), but entering codice_7 followed by will produce añ. This also works in Microsoft Word 2002/2003 for Windows.\nIn Microsoft Word 2007/2010 for Windows has to be used.\n\nIn Mac OS 8.5 and later, one can choose the \"Unicode Hex Input\" keyboard layout; in OS X Yosemite, this can be added in Keyboard → Input Sources. Holding down , one types the four-digit hexadecimal Unicode code point and the equivalent character appears; one can then release the key. Characters outside of the BMP exceed the four-digit limit of the Unicode hex input mechanism but can be entered using the search entry box in the Character Viewer (Edit → Emoji & Symbols) or by using surrogate pairs: holding down the key while entering the first surrogate, the , the second surrogate, then releasing the Option key.\n\nThe possibility of hexadecimal code input on operating systems using the X Window System depends on the system and applications. Hex input is not implemented in the common X.Org Server. Individual input methods and GUI toolkits can provide hex input independent of the X server.\n\nFor example, GTK+ is an ISO/IEC 14755-conformant system. The beginning sequence is and the ending sequence is or . Programs based on GTK+, such as GNOME applications, support Unicode input.\n\nThere are two common methods for direct input of Unicode characters:\n\nIn non-GTK applications, however, there usually is no escape sequence to input arbitrary input characters. For example, Qt and KDE rely on the standard X Input Method (XIM) framework, and do not implement their own solutions. In xterm, these input methods are not supported, but using escape sequences is an alternative. rxvt-unicode implements optional ISO/IEC 14755, enabled by default.\n\nHowever, regardless of the toolkit used, the Compose key subsystem can be used to configure certain key stroke combinations to input a subset of unicode.\n\n\nHTML uses a different syntax for code points. Character codes may be specified after ampersand (&) and the number sign (#), and are followed by the semicolon (;). The number can be either in decimal or in hexadecimal. Preceding zeros may be omitted. If the input is in hexadecimal, the number is preceded by an \"x\". Some characters can also be specified by \"entity name\".\nExample: The HTML code of the copyright sign © (codice_9) can be:\ncodice_10 (decimal input)\ncodice_11 (hexadecimal input)\ncodice_12 (entity name)\nThe HTML option in the Thunderbird Insert menu allows the insertion of Unicode characters using either decimal or hexadecimal values with the HTML syntax. , , and each produces a ' © '.\n\n"}

They can be undertaken by a range of different stakeholders including:\n\nWalking audits often collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the walking environment.\n\nThe Pedestrian Environment Review System (PERS) is the most developed and widely used walking audit tool available.\nPERS is “a systematic process to assess the pedestrian environment within a framework that promotes objectivity”. The environment is reviewed from the end user perspective of a vulnerable pedestrian. PERS consists of:\n\nA PERS walking audit collects both quantitative and qualitative data on six types of facility in the street environment:\n\nEach facility is rated on a seven point scale (-3 to +3) for different parameters such as effective width, dropped kerbs, permeability or personal security. PERS also rates disabled peoples access. These PERS ratings are linked to Red/Amber/Green (RAG) colour-coding. The PERS software allows users to analyse and display walkability data using GIS maps, charts and quick win recommendation lists.\n\nPERS was originally developed in 2001 by TRL and London Borough of Bromley. The software tool (PERS 1) was designed to allow transport professionals and community groups to quickly and cost-effectively assess and rate the walkability of local streets and recommend improvements for pedestrians. This version of the tool assessed Links, Crossings and Routes. In 2005 Transport for London and TRL co-developed PERS 2 which expanded the original system to include Public Transport Waiting Areas (PTWA), Public Spaces and Interchange Spaces. In 2009 ransport for London and TRL further developed the tool into PERS 3 which included a built in GIS mapping tool and the ability to add photographs and georeferences of quick wins (low cost, easy to implement physical improvements). PERS 3 also has the added functionality of automatically generate quick-win recommendation work lists for Highway work crews.\n\nThe PERS tool has been used by organisations all over the world and has been used extensively in London to assess over 200 km of the street network.\n\nResearch undertaken by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) have used the PERS walking audit method to show:\n\"how we can calculate the extra financial value that good street design contributes, over average or poor design\".\n\nThe study found a direct link between an increase in PERS scores (and therefore an increase in the quality of a street for pedestrians) and residential house prices. The study demonstrates how PERS can be used to show how:\n\"clear financial benefits can be calculated from investing in better quality street design\".\n\n\n"}

The same materials can also be used for symbolic or representational drawings. Building material on which writings or drawings are produced are not included. The gross characterization of writing materials is by the material constituting the writing surface (for example, paper) and the number, size, and usage and storage configuration of multiple surfaces (for example, paper sheets) into a single object (for example, a spiral notebook). Writing materials are often paired with specific types of writing instruments. Other important attributes of a writing material are its reusability, its permanence, and its resistance to fraudulent misuse.\n\nBecause drawing preceded writing, the first remains of writing materials are the stone walls of the caves on which the famous images were drawn. Another precursor were tally sticks used to record the count of objects or the passage of discrete units of time (days). Tally sticks have been found made of wood and of bone. Knotted ropes and similar materials were also used for tallies. Such materials did not take a great deal of preparation for their use for drawing or writing. Animal hides also had potential for use as a material for writing or drawing, although the drawings and writings may have been decorative or to convey status or religious meaning. Among the barks of trees, birch bark is very well suited for use as a writing material and was so used both in Northern Europe and among native peoples in North America.\n\nFour other classes of material were sometimes used for writing: clay, wax, cloth, and metal. The value of metal for useful implements may have made it less than useful for practical writing and drawing. The very hardness of many metals that made them useful also made it an inconvenient material for many kinds of writing. But foils or sheets of soft metals like lead were usable. Lead sheets were used for curse tablets, as well as personal correspondence.\n\nCloth probably shared its mode of use with animal skins. Clay introduces the useful combination of extreme ease of making the inscription with the potential for rendering it fairly permanent. Unglazed pottery can readily accept inscription even after firing. Wax offers another novel combination of advantage: a reusable surface, easily inscribed and erased, and easy combination with materials like wood that give it durability. Stone tablets, clay and wooden writing tablets, and wax-covered wooden tablets are some of the first specialized configurations of materials in flat surfaces specifically for writing.\n\nUnglazed pottery shards were used almost as a kind of scratch paper, as ostraka, for tax receipts and, in Athens, to record the individual nominations of Greek leaders for ostracism.\n\nThe archaeological record contains either examples of these materials used for drawing or writing or it has indirect indications of their use for writing, drawing, or tallying.\n\nIn western civilisations, early use of papyrus was soon replaced by parchment made by treating animal hide. A wide variety of parchments from various animal skins, with different texture, quality and hue were widely used for codices, religious and cultural texts. This was replaced by the advent and increasing access and availability of paper.\n\nIn eastern civilisations such as India, the principal writing media were birch bark or \"bhurjapatra\" (Sanskrit) and dried palm leaves. The use of paper began only after the 10th century. However birch bark and palm leaf continue to be used even today on a limited scale in a rural milieu for the use of horoscopes, wedding invitations and other cultural uses.\n\nIn China, the early material was animal bones, later silk, bamboo and wooden slips, until the 2nd century when paper was invented.\n\nWriting seems to have become more widespread with the invention of papyrus in Egypt. Parchment, using sheepskins left after the wool was removed for cloth, was sometimes cheaper than papyrus, which had to be imported outside Egypt. With the invention of wood-pulp paper, the cost of writing material began a steady decline.\n\nThe dramatic increase in demand foray paper associated with the printing press stimulated dramatic cost reduction efforts. Specialized materials developed for printing have also been made available for writing. The invention of the typewriter was a major step, making possible reliable production of legible written materials by organizations and individual writers.\n\nElectronic media have utilized the keyboard developed for the typewriter, electrical and electronic circuitry and storage devices, and the viewing screen developed for reading electronic signals to separate the medium for writing from the medium for reading.\n\n\n"}

Kupala is considered one of the greatest Belarusian-language writers of the 20th century.\n\nKupala was born on July 7, 1882 in Viazynka, a folwark settlement near Maladzyechna. His family was noble, although both of Kupala's parents were employed as tenant farmers at the folwark. Kupala was thus essentially born into a landless peasant class. Kupala received a traditional Belarusian education, completing his studies in 1898. Following the death of his father in 1902, Kupala worked a variety of short-term jobs, including as a tutor, a shop assistant, and a record keeper.\n\nKupala's first serious literary attempt was \"Ziarno\", a Polish-language sentimental poem which he completed around 1903–1904 under the pseudonym \"K-a.\" His first Belarusian-language work (\"Мая доля\") was dated July 15, 1904. Kupala's first published poem, \"Мужык\" (\"Peasant\"), was published approximately a year later, appearing in Belarusian in the Russophone Belarusian newspaper \"Severo-Zapadnyi Krai\" (\"Northwestern Krai\") on May 11, 1905. A number of subsequent poems by Kupala appeared in the Belarusian-language newspaper \"Nasha Niva\" from 1906 to 1907.\n\nKupala moved to Vilnius in 1908, where he continued with his career as a poet. The same year the first published collection of his poems, \"Жалейка\" (\"The Little Flute\") brought on the ire of the czarist government, which ordered the book confiscated as an anti-government publication. The order for Kupala's arrest was revoked in 1909, but a second printing was again confiscated, this time by the local authorities in Vilnius. Kupala ceased working for the \"Nasha Niva\" in order to avoid ruining the reputation of the newspaper.\n\nKupala left for Saint Petersburg in 1909. The subsequent year saw the publication of several works, including the poem \"Адвечная песьня\" (\"Eternal Song\"), which appeared as a book in St. Petersburg in July 1910. \"Сон на кургане\" (\"Dream on a Barrow\")– completed in August 1910 –symbolised the poor state of Kupala's Belarusian homeland. Kupala left St. Petersburg and returned to Vilnius in 1913. Among those influencing Kupala in the 1910s was Maxim Gorky.\n\nKupala's writing changed to an optimistic tone following the Great October Revolution of 1917. Among Kupala's numerous translations into the Belarusian language were the internationalist-Marxist anthem \"The Internationale\" and an ancient epic poem The Tale of Igor's Campaign (translated in 1921). Nevertheless, Kupala maintained his connections with the anti-Soviet oriented nationalist emigres of the Belarusian People's Republic, who exhorted that he join them in exile in Czechoslovakia during a trip abroad in 1927. At home, the newly established authorities considered him with some distrust–at times, criticism of Kupala in the press mounted insofar as Kupala's activities were regarded as too oriented around nationalism. This period stopped once Kupala printed a public letter of apology in the 1930s.\n\nKupala was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1941 for the poetry collection \"Ад сэрца\" (\"From the Heart\"). With the Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany in 1941, because of being very ill he moved to Moscow and then to Tatarstan. Even from there he wrote poems supporting the Belarusian partisans fighting against Nazi Germany. He died in Moscow in 1942, aged 59, having fallen down the stairwell in Hotel Moskva. \n\nKupala became recognised as a symbol of culture of Belarus during the Soviet era. A museum, organised in Minsk through the efforts of his widow in 1945, is the leading literary museum in Belarus. Hrodna State University was named after Yanka Kupala. There is also a park named after him with a monument to the poet, a theatre and a metro station (Kupalaŭskaja) named after him in Minsk.\n\nAt the Arrow Park in Monroe, New York there is a monument of Yanka Kupala that was created by Belarusian sculptor Anatoly Anikeichik and architect Sergey Botkovsky. Since 1973 it is presented to the American Side. A monument to Kupala is placed on a square in the city of Ashdod in Israel.\n\n"}
