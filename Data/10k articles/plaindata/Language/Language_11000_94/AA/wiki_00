The term was mostly used in the first half of the 20th century, when they worked together to develop common interests and a coordinated approach to issues in the region with relatively little influence from outside powers, in contrast with the Cold War governments.\n\nDuring the early 20th century Argentina, Brazil, and Chile engaged in naval arms race, beginning with Brazil purchasing three dreadnoughts in response to the recently-concluded Argentine-Chilean naval arms race.\n\nThe Niagara Falls peace conference is the first well-known use of the term \"ABC\". On May 20, 1914, the three countries met in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, to mediate between the United States and Mexico after increasing tensions over the Tampico Affair, the United States occupation of Veracruz, and developing issues that led to the Mexican Revolution. At the conference, the United States was represented by Frederick William Lehmann, a former United States Solicitor General, and Joseph Rucker Lamar, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nOn May 15, 1915, the ABC countries met again to sign a more formal treaty, designed to develop cooperation, nonaggression and the arbitration of disputes. It was formulated to resist United States' influence in the region and to establish mechanisms for consultation among the three signatory countries, such as setting up a permanent mediation commission. The official name was the Consultation, Non-Aggression and Arbitration Pact.\n\nAlthough the treaty was not official until it was ratified by Brazil, much of the foreign policy of the three signatories between 1915 and 1930 followed the basis of consultations and mutual initiative which the ABC Pact envisaged. To this end, the press used the name \"ABC Pact\" when the signatory countries co-operated to pursue integration initiatives in South America, concluded official agreements or actions regarding foreign policy, or promoted ideologically and politically similar organizations within the region.\n\nIn 1942 the ABC countries, with the United States, mediated in the peace terms of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War. This led to the loss of all disputed territory in the Amazon Basin that was claimed by Ecuador before the war.\n\n\n"}

There are very few remaining fragments of his work, principally covering the civil war and the reign of Augustus Caesar. In 25 AD he was forced by Sejanus, who was praetorian prefect under Tiberius, to take his life after being accused of \"maiestas (treason)\". He had been accused by Satrius Secundus of having eulogized Brutus and spoken of Cassius as the last of the Romans, which was considered an offence under the \"lex majestatis,\" and the senate ordered the burning of his writings. Seneca the Younger, however, tells us that he most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him, because Sejanus had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source—a letter to Cordus' daughter Marcia—that he starved himself to death. She was also instrumental in saving his work, so that it could be published again under Caligula. Apart from Seneca, he is mentioned by Tacitus, Quintilian, Suetonius and Dio Cassius. Even though Cordus committed suicide, his work survived, prompting Tacitus to deride \"the stupidity of people who believe that today's authority can destroy tomorrow's memories.\"\n\nThe trial of the historian Cremutius Cordus took place under the reign of Tiberius in 25 AD. The charge was, according to Tacitus, \"a new charge for the first time heard\" (\"novo ac tunc primum audito crimine\"). According to Mary R. McHugh, no one had been charged with \"maiestas\" (treason) for writing a history (\"editis annalibus\"). \n\nA few years after Cordus's death, Seneca the Younger wrote \"Ad Marciam\" in order to console Marcia, Cordus's daughter, on the occasion of her son Metilius's death. Even though \"Ad Marciam\" is not primarily about Cordus, Seneca indicates that the works of Cordus have been re-published. Suetonius unequivocally asserts that the works of Cremutius Cordus were put back into circulation during the reign of Gaius [Caligula].\n\nMarcia seems to have been actively involved in the re-publication of her father's works. When Seneca wrote \"Ad Marciam\" he mentioned that Metilius had died three years previously and Marcia is unable to seek solace even from her \"beloved literature\". Therefore, her contribution to the publication of her father's work pre-dates the death of her son. \n\nVasily Rudich believes that \"...the extent to which Seneca goes in his glorification of Cremutius Cordus is unbelievable.\" He also brings to attention the fact that \"Seneca avoids any direct allusion to Cordus's alleged Republican sympathies, whatever their true character may have been.\" \n\nAccording to Rebecca Langlands, Cordus's story \"...is a tale which vividly demonstrates the possibility that a text might be received in a way which the author had not intended or anticipated, and be received in a way which might have dire consequences for author and text.\" As Langlands seems to suggest, Cordus was thus a man deeply misunderstood as a writer intending to vilify the royal family of the time, by his seemingly seditious work.\n\nIn his essay \"Bookburning and Censorship in Ancient Rome\", Frederick H. Cramer talks about the \"...spineless schoolmaster Quintilian [who] grudgingly admitted that 'the bold utterances of Cremutius also have their admirers and deserve their fame, but he went on to assure readers that 'the passages that brought him to his ruin have been expurgated.'\" Cramer also suggests that it was not unlikely for one of Quintilian's students to have been Tacitus, who later said:\nThe Fathers ordered his books to be burned...but some copies survived, hidden at the time, but afterwards published. Laughable, indeed, are the delusions of those who fancy that by their exercise of their ephemeral power, posterity can be defrauded of information. On the contrary, through persecution the reputation of the persecuted talents grows stronger. Foreign despots and all those who have used the same barbarous methods have only succeeded in bringing disgrace upon themselves and glory to their victims.\nCordus also appears in Ben Jonson's \"Sejanus: His Fall\". According to Martin Butler, \"Jonson gives Cordus an eloquent defence of the historian's objectivity, but we never learn what his ultimate fate is. History might redeem the past by preserving truth about it, but it is more likely that truth will be an early casualty of politics.\"\n"}

{"id": "1290315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1290315", "title": "CableCARD", "text": "CableCARD\n\nCableCARD is a special-use PC Card device that allows consumers in the United States to view and record digital cable television channels on digital video recorders, personal computers and television sets on equipment such as a set-top box not provided by a cable television company. The card is usually provided by the local cable operator, typically for a nominal monthly fee.\n\nIn a broader context, CableCARD refers to a set of technologies created by the United States cable television industry to allow devices from non-cable companies to access content on the cable networks. Some technologies not only refer to the physical card, but also to a device (\"Host\") that uses the card. Some CableCARD technologies can be used with devices that have no physical CableCARD.\n\nThe CableCARD was the outcome of a U.S. federal government objective, directed in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to provide a robust competitive retail market for set-top boxes so consumers did not have to use proprietary equipment from the cable operators. It was believed that this would provide consumers with more choices and lower costs. Up to 2016, less than 2% of set-top boxes were purchased by consumers in the retail market since CableCARD was rolled out, indicating that CableCARD failed in its objective. Telecom lobbyists argued that the CableCARD initiative actually cost Americans billions of dollars in additional fees, increased energy consumption, and stifled innovation.\n\nThe portion of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which resulted in the creation of CableCARDs is known as Section 629, instructing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to:\nMultichannel video programming refers to cable or satellite television. A driving motivation of this passage was to foster the kind of consumer choices that resulted after the Federal government landmark Carterfone ruling requiring telephone companies to allow consumers to purchase third-party telephones for attachment to the phone company network. The thought was that consumers would benefit from wider choices due to competition between consumer electronics (CE) manufacturers unaffiliated with cable companies.\n\nThe FCC was charged with working with the industry to carry out the directives of the 1996 law. On June 11, 1998, after securing proposals and recommendations from interested parties, the FCC ordered that cable companies would provide a separable security access device by July 1, 2000 which could be used by third-party devices to access digital cable networks. The separable security device was referred to in FCC regulations as a \"Point of Deployment\" (POD) module. After many requests for delay from the cable industry, the first CableCARD devices became available from third party manufacturers in August 2004.\n\nAs of November 1, 2011, all US cable operators were required to allow self-installation of CableCARDs by consumers.\n\nA major concern was that cable operators were not motivated to provide efficient security access mechanisms to equipment competitors. To address this, the FCC directed that by January 1, 2005, that cable operators must use the same separable access device available to third-parties and they were banned from providing equipment with an integrated security access mechanism. This rule is usually referred to as the \"integration ban\", and was unsuccessfully challenged in the courts and petitions to the FCC by the cable operators. The deadline was shifted forward twice until it went into effect on July 1, 2007. The ban on integrated security ended in December 2015.\n\n\"CableCARD\" is a term trademarked by CableLabs for the Point of Deployment (POD) module defined by standards including SCTE 28, SCTE 41, CEA-679 and others. The physical CableCARD is inserted into a slot in the host (typically a digital television set or a set-top box) in order to identify and authorize the customer, and to provide proprietary decoding of the encrypted digital cable signal without the need for a proprietary set-top box. The cable tuner, QAM demodulator, and MPEG decoder are part of the host equipment. The card performs any conditional access and decryption functions, and provides a MPEG-2 transport stream to the host. The card also receives messages sent over the out-of-band signaling channel by the cable company's headend servers and forwards them to the host.\n\nCableCARDs may be used to access both standard definition and high definition channels as long as they are not part of a switched video system. (This applies to one-way devices only; two-way devices are capable of receiving and viewing switched video. The ability for one-way devices to receive and view switched video has changed with the addition of the Tuning Resolver Interface Specification. Tuning adaptors and tuning adaptor interfaces have been added to provide communication back to the headend needed for switched video.) CableCARDs are not necessary for viewing unscrambled digital cable channels if the user has a QAM tuner—a feature in some televisions and DVRs. CableCARD support is most common on higher end televisions that include a special slot for the CableCARD and a built-in cable tuner. The card acts like a unique \"key\" to unlock the channels and services to which the cable customer has subscribed, and the television's remote-control will also control the cable channels. Televisions that support CableCARD should be labeled by the manufacturer as \"digital cable ready\" (DCR).\n\nInteractive features such as video on demand rely on the CableCARD Host device being an OpenCable Host Device and have nothing to do with the physical card. This makes the common use of the phrase \"CableCARD 2.0\" as a requirement for video on demand misleading, since two way services have been provided with the actual cards from the very beginning.\n\nThe physical CableCARD inserted into the host device is a PC Card type II that handles decryption of video and ensures that only authorized subscribers may view it. This is also known as a \"conditional-access module\" function.\n\nThere are two kinds of physical CableCARDs:\n\nNo actual M-Cards were released before the introduction of CableCARD 2.0, which combined and enhanced the CableCARD 1.0 and Multi-Stream standards. M-Cards are backward compatible with current CableCARD devices. To older CableCARD devices that do not support multiple streams, the card appears to be a single stream card. CE companies have long wanted M-Cards for their CableCARD 1.0 host devices in order to compete with devices that use multiple tuners. This is important for products such as Moxi and TiVo CableCARD DVRs, televisions with picture-in-picture and CableCARD-equipped personal computers, which need to record one show while a user is watching another. To enable this without an M-Card, these products would be required to use multiple S-CARDs.\n\nExisting integrated cable set-top boxes perform four basic functions:\n\nNew digital televisions and other devices that are labeled \"DCR\" (Digital cable ready) contain:\n\nThe CableCARD 2.0 specification includes support for #1-4, interactive two-way communications; however it is unknown exactly when CableCARD 2.0 hosts and compatible servers will become available. Future devices which support CableCARD 2.0 are expected to be labeled iDCR \"Interactive digital cable ready\". Among other requirements, CableCARD 2.0 hosts will be required to provide the OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP), also known as Tru2Way, to run programs downloaded from the cable company.\n\nBecause the conditional access system is in software, it can be sent with the video as a form of digital rights management. The CableCARD Host Licensing Agreement and the DCAS agreement restrict the technologies that CE companies may use for distributing video from host devices. CE companies object to this expanding the notion of CableCARD network security issues to also include content protection issues. They prefer to deal with content owners directly with their standards and regard cable company protocols and formats as a transport only. CE companies wish to communicate video inside the home network using their own protected protocols and formats.\n\nThe OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP) is a [Java (programming language)|Java]]-based platform intended for use either with any security access scheme—whether it is CableCARD 2.0 devices or future downloadable security schemes. OCAP was tied to CableCARDs because, as it was imagined by CableLabs, the additional processing necessary for managing the communication with the cable company server would be performed, not on the cable company provided equipment (the CableCARD), but on the consumer electronics device—known as the CableCARD \"Host\". CE companies objected that OCAP is unnecessary for the simple task of managing two-way communications on the cable networks. The CEA perspective is that Java is not efficient for CE devices, and that cable companies are passing to CE manufacturers the costs of a software platform which they didn't need, and which won't run on their existing hardware architectures.\n\nThe consumer electronics industry proposed in November 2006 that the CableCARD 2.0 specification be upgraded to include the provision for modified MCards that would support the communications necessary for VOD, PPV, and Switched Video. This card would be backward compatible with older cards, and support would be required for them on cable company servers by January 2008. These modified MCards would not allow two-way communication using current OCURs, which, by definition, are unidirectional. This so-called \"OCAP-less\" proposal was rejected by the NCTA for a variety of reasons elaborated on in the issues segment of this article. The technical advantage is that much less is assumed about the computing capability of the host, allowing the manufacturing cost to be significantly reduced. The disadvantage is that the MCard will be slightly more expensive, but the host will not necessarily be able to support the envisioned ecommerce and banking applications. CE companies argue that such a card fulfills the 1996 law's requirement that cable companies allow two-way communication on their networks, and that OCAP fulfills technical goals far in excess of those necessary for such two-way communications.\n\nCable providers in the United States are required by the FCC to support the CableCARD 2.0 standard. The specification was developed by CableLabs, a research group run by a consortium of cable companies. Devices that use CableCARDs are known as \"Hosts\" and must be certified as compliant with the specification by CableLabs. The certification process can be lengthy and is performed in batches on a regular cycle every three months.\n\nThe first test tool to verify compliance of OpenCable hosts with the CableCARD one-way single stream specifications, HPNX, was released by SCM and Digital Keystone in 2003. Subsequently the HPNX Pro version, supporting two-way and M-card specifications, was released by Digital Keystone in 2006. The \"M-UDCP Device Acceptance Test Plan\" published by CableLabs defines how to use the HPNX Pro test tool to validate the OpenCable host devices.\n\nThe first test tool to verify compliance of the CableCARD devices with the OpenCable specifications, Host Emulator Tool, and produced by Margi Systems, was first utilized by CableLabs to validate the Scientific Atlanta (Cisco) and Motorola POD devices in 2003 (POD was later renamed to CableCard).\n\nCable companies in the United States are required to provide CableCARDs conforming to this specification, and must correct incompatibilities between their networks and certified CableCARD devices.\n\nThe current CableCARD standard was borne out of an adversarial process between two main groups: cable companies represented by the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) and consumer electronics companies represented by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA). The portion of the CableCARD specs that could be agreed upon describe how one-way services work, so only the portion known as UDCP (Unidirectional Digital Cable Product) was required by the FCC. As it was the only thing required, most of the early devices were one-way capable; however all the actual CableCARDs produced were two-way capable. Many enhancements to the CableCARD standard including the optional Multi-Stream support became known as CableCARD 2.0.\n\nOptical cable services (e.g. Verizon Fios) are classified as cable services and must, by FCC rules, also support the CableCARD standard. In Canada, cable providers Cogeco and Shaw offer CableCARD-enabled DVRs. Video providers in Europe must conform to the DVB standard which is a more comprehensive open standard governed by independent standards bodies.\n\nCableCARDs can also support non-television functions and can act as a cable modem controller with the host providing modulation and demodulation functions and the card providing decoding and IP routing functionality; however this feature is rarely used and depends on the cable provider.\n\nThere was much resistance from cable operators to the CableCARD rollout across the United States, preferring to support their own set-top boxes. The adoption proceeded slowly with 141,000 units by February 2006. The resistance softened somewhat with the July 2007 FCC ban on integrated security in set-top boxes, which required all new set-top boxes to use CableCARDs as their decryption mechanism. By June 2009, the top 10 \"incumbent\" U.S. cable operators had deployed more than 14 million operator-supplied set-tops with CableCARDs and 437,800 CableCARD modules for use in retail devices. The National Cable Television Association reported in April 2016 that only 621,400 CableCARDs were deployed for use in retail devices by the nine largest incumbent cable operators, compared to 55 million operator-supplied set-top boxes with CableCARDs.\nThis indicates that the CableCARD failed to achieve the goal of a competitive retail market for set-top boxes.\n\nIn 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a notice of inquiry for a successor system, called AllVid. Unlike CableCARD, AllVid intended to enable two-way services such as interactive program guides, pay-per-view, and video on demand.\n\nThere are still many in the cable industry who are advocating that physical CableCARDs be dropped entirely. These cable companies prefer to move away from physical cards, and have proposed that a downloadable security component known as Downloadable Conditional Access System (DCAS) be used instead of a physical CableCARD. In this proposal, a custom security chip must be soldered into every compliant host; if a security scheme is compromised, a new security program can be downloaded to the host device. The FCC has not yet approved it.\n\nConsumer electronic companies advocate their proposal for more unfettered access to cable company networks, with CableLabs' role reduced to addressing only cable company interests of maintaining network stability and security.\n\n\n"}

It is also known as Kamtok (from 'Cameroon-talk'). Five varieties are currently recognised:\n\n\nCameroonian Pidgin English is an English-based creole language. About 5% of Cameroonians are native speakers of the language, while an estimated 50% of the population speak it in some form. \n\nThe terms \"Cameroonian Pidgin\", \"Cameroonian Pidgin English\", \"Cameroonian Creole\" and \"Kamtok\" are synonyms for what Cameroonians call Cameroon Pidgin English. Many speakers are unaware that this language is different from English proper. It is a variety of West African Pidgin Englishes spoken along the coast from Ghana to Cameroon. It is a vehicular language that has been in active use in the country for over 200 years. It came into being in the Slave Trade Years (1440 to early 1800s). It preceded English in Cameroon: the first Baptist missionaries who arrived in Cameroon in 1845 and introduced formal education in English, had to learn Pidgin. A few decades later during the German annexation period (1884–1914), Pidgin resisted a German ban. It took flight when it became a makeshift language used in German plantations and undertakings by forced labourers who were drawn from the hinterland and who spoke different indigenous languages. With time it passed into use in the market place, and was adopted by Baptist missionaries as the language of their evangelical crusade. For many years, it has been used on school playgrounds and campuses and in political campaigns, and today it is forcing its way into spoken media. (For a comprehensive description of its linguistic features and its place in the language ecology of Cameroon, see amongst others, Kouega 2007 and 2008).\n\nLike most West African languages, Kamtok has seven vowels, with two mid vowels: open and closed (Schneider 1966:14-17). Schneider spells the mid vowels as closed \"ey\" and \"ow\" vs. open \"e\" and \"o\" but Todd spells them as closed \"e\" and \"o\" vs. open \"eh\" and \"oh\".\n\nThe palatal approximate is written \"y\", the palatal affricates and are written \"ch\" and \"j\", and the palatal and velar nasals and are written \"ny\" and \"ng\" (Schneider 1966:12-14). Some of these consonants, such as and , are not distinguished by speakers who lack such distinctions in their local substrate languages (1966:225-229).\n\n\nThe basic pronoun system of Kamtok distinguishes three persons and two numbers. In most cases, the shape of the pronoun does not change to show grammatical function. Two exceptions involve the first person singular, where \"a\" serves as a subject clitic on verbs, as in \"mi, a mos go\" 'I must go', and \"ma\" is the possessive pronoun, as in \"ma beli\" 'my stomach'. The other major exception is \"-am\" in place of \"i\" or \"dem\" as an object suffix on verbs, except when the referent is human, as in \"a go was-am\" 'I'll wash it'. (Schneider 1966:64-68). Acrolectal speakers, however, are more likely to use \"dei\" for \"dem\" in subject position and \"ohs\" for \"wi\" in object position (Todd, n.d.).\n\nVerbs are not inflected to show grammatical tense, aspect, modality, or negation. Instead, these notions are conveyed by a small set of preverbal auxiliaries (Schneider 1966:69-72, 95-104).\n\nExamples:\nThe rendition of a short passage from English to Cameroon Pidgin:\n\nEnglish language:\nCameroon Pidgin:\nIn pidgin unlike in English, 'S' is not used at the end of nouns to mark their plural state. Instead, this is what is used:\n\n\n"}

The original photo is displayed on the left. In the next image to the right, a single bit was changed from 0 to 1. In the next two images, two and three bits were flipped.

DRAM may be altered by cosmic rays or other high-energy particles. Such data degradation is known as a soft error. ECC memory can be used to mitigate this type of data degradation.\n\nData degradation results from the gradual decay of storage media over the course of years or longer. Causes vary by medium:\n\nMost disk, disk controller and higher-level systems are subject to a slight chance of unrecoverable failure. With ever-growing disk capacities, file sizes, and increases in the amount of data stored on a disk, the likelihood of the occurrence of data decay and other forms of uncorrected and undetected data corruption increases.\n\nHigher-level software systems may be employed to mitigate the risk of such underlying failures by increasing redundancy and implementing integrity checking and self-repairing algorithms. The ZFS file system was designed to address many of these data corruption issues. The Btrfs file system also includes data protection and recovery mechanisms, as does ReFS.\n"}

Duke is an exonymic name (not used by speakers themselves). Endonymic names (used by the speakers themselves) are Dughore (Ndughore) and Kolei. Dughore is also a name for an area in southwest Kolombangara, 'Kolei' is the general bilateral address term specific to Nduke. A more recent alternative name is Kolombangara (after the name of the island).\n\nOral history in Dughore recounts that the northwest, northeast and southeast of Kolombangara had their own languages, which became extinct when the people of those areas were annihilated in warfare that probably occurred in the early 19th century. The people of the southwest built a series of hill fortresses and survived. At the beginning of the colonial period (about 1900), Duke had about 250 speakers, all concentrated in the southwest.\n\nInter-island exchange with neighbouring island language areas of Vella Lavella, Simbo and Roviana was strong in the latter 19th century, possibly leading to some language borrowing, although marriage remained largely endogamous at that time. In the early twentieth century, colonial rule instituted Roviana as a lingua franca, and the Seventh-day Adventist church, which was widely adopted on Kolombangara, used bible materials written in Marovo. By the mid-twentieth century marriages to Marovo became numerous and many households are bilingual Duke/Marovo. Roviana, although it ceased to be a regional lingua franca in the 1960s, is still widely understood by Duke speakers. Twentieth century borrowing from Roviana and Marovo has occurred to a small extent.\n\nFrom the 1960s onward many marriages have taken place across the wider Solomons, leading to mixed language communities, at the same time that Solomon Pijin has risen to prominence as a national language. As a result, Pijin is a widely used household language on Kolombangara, which in some families has almost fully replaced Duke. Additionally, re-orientation of the economy away from the traditional Oceanic lifestyle has led to less reliance on traditional ecological knowledge and traditional technology, so that many specialist terms have largely been forgotten. The lexical richness of the language is now markedly less among speakers under 40 years old. Ethnologue rates the language as 'vigorous'.\n\nOrthography refers to the spelling system used to write words down. The Nduke alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet. The first systematic orthography was used by A.M. Hocart in 1908 to document a Nduke wordlist and Nduke anthropological fieldnotes. These sources were never published and did not form the basis for later orthographies. Two variant orthographies arose in local use, based on that used by the Methodist mission for Roviana language, and that used by the Seventh-day Adventist mission for Marovo language. These missions arrived in Nduke in 1917 and 1919 respectively. Recent lexical work on Nduke has used a composite of these two orthographies to avoid ambiguity.\n\nNduke orthography\nThere are five diphthongs: , , , , and \n\nThe pronoun series is typically Oceanic.

According to Pausanias the Lexicographer (Eust. ad Od. 20, 247, p. 1864), their name derives from their being inscribed on the cult image of Artemis in Ephesus. Clement of Alexandria considers them an invention of the Daktyloi.\n\nSimilar to the mantras of Buddhism and Hinduism, they were \"meaningless words\" (ἄσημα ὀνόματα) potent to protect those who could speak them correctly, their power residing in their sound, so that they were ineffective if mispronounced.\nPlutarch (Quaest. Conv. 706D) reports that the Magi instructed victims of demonic possession to recite the Ephesia Grammata.\n\nIn the 4th century comedy \"Lyropoios\" by Anaxilas, one character carries Ephesia Grammata inscribed on his belt.\n\nThe best known Ephesia Grammata are a group of six words: \nA version of this formula seems to be attested by a damaged inscription from Himera, Sicily, which must date to before the Carthaginian destruction of the city in 409 BC. The next earliest epigraphic evidence for the formula comes from the 4th century BC, and it continues to re-appear on magical papyri throughout the Hellenistic period. The words sometimes occur in significantly different variants, for example on the lead tablet of Phalasarna, Crete:\n\nThere were various attempts by ancient authors to make sense of the words. \"\" was interpreted as the name of a Dactyl.\nAndrocydes proposed an interpretation as philosophical symbols (Clement, \"Stromata\" 5, 8, 45, 2):\n' ( \"shadowless\") as \"darkness\", ' ( \"shadowy\") as \"brightness\" (brightness being necessary in order to cast shadows), ' (Hsch.: ) as an ancient term for \"Earth\", and ' ( \"fourfold\") as the year (the four seasons), ' as \"Sun\" and ' ( \"right, fitting, auspicious\") as Logos.\n"}
{"id": "9534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9534", "title": "Euphemism", "text": "Euphemism\n\nA euphemism is a generally innocuous word or expression used in place of one that may be found offensive or suggest something unpleasant. Some euphemisms are intended to amuse, while others use bland, inoffensive terms for concepts that the user wishes to downplay. Euphemisms may be used to refer to taboo topics (such as disability, sex, excretion, or death) in a polite way, or to mask profanity.\n\n\"Euphemism\" comes from the Greek word () which refers to the use of 'words of good omen'; it is a compound of (), meaning 'good, well', and (), meaning 'prophetic speech; rumour, talk'. \"Eupheme\" is a reference to the female Greek spirit of words of praise and positivity, etc. The term \"euphemism\" itself was used as a euphemism by the ancient Greeks; with the meaning \"to keep a holy silence\" (speaking well by not speaking at all).\n\nReasons for using euphemisms vary by context and intent. Commonly, euphemisms are used to avoid directly addressing subjects that might be deemed negative or embarrassing. Euphemisms are also used to downplay the gravity of large-scale injustices, war crimes, or other events that warrant a pattern of avoidance in official statements or documents. For instance, one reason for the comparative scarcity of written evidence documenting the exterminations at Auschwitz, relative to their sheer number, is \"directives for the extermination process obscured in bureaucratic euphemisms\".\n\nThe act of labeling a term as a euphemism can in itself be controversial, as in the following two examples:\n\n\nPhonetic euphemism is used to replace profanities, diminishing their intensity. Modifications include:\n\n\nEuphemism may be used as a rhetorical strategy, in which case its goal is to change the valence of a description from positive to negative.\n\nThe use of a term with a softer connotation, though it shares the same meaning. For instance, \"screwed up\" is a euphemism for \"fucked up\"; \"hook-up\" and \"laid\" are euphemisms for sexual intercourse.\n\nThere is some disagreement over whether certain terms are or are not euphemisms. For example, sometimes the phrase \"visually impaired\" is labeled as a politically correct euphemism for \"blind\" or a blind person. However, \"visual impairment\" can be a broader term, including, for example, people who have partial sight in one eye, those with uncorrectable mild to moderate poor vision, or even those who wear glasses, groups that would be excluded by the word \"blind\".\n\nExpressions or words from a foreign language may be imported for use as a replacement for an offensive word. For example, the French word \"enceinte\" was sometimes used instead of the English word \"pregnant\". This practice of word substitution became so frequent that the expression \"pardon my French\" was adopted in attempts to excuse the use of profanity.\n\nEuphemisms may be formed in a number of ways. Periphrasis, or circumlocution, is one of the most common: to \"speak around\" a given word, implying it without saying it. Over time, circumlocutions become recognized as established euphemisms for particular words or ideas.\n\nTo alter the pronunciation or spelling of a taboo word (such as a swear word) to form a euphemism is known as \"taboo deformation\", or a minced oath. In American English, words that are unacceptable on television, such as \"fuck\", may be represented by deformations such as \"freak\", even in children's cartoons.. Feck is a minced oath popularised by the sitcom Father Ted. Some examples of rhyming slang may serve the same purpose: to call a person a \"berk\" sounds less offensive than to call a person a \"cunt\", though \"berk\" is short for Berkeley Hunt, which rhymes with \"cunt\".\n\nBureaucracies frequently spawn euphemisms intentionally, as doublespeak expressions. For example, in the past, the US military used the term \"sunshine units\" for contamination by radioactive isotopes. An effective death sentence in the Soviet Union during the Great Purge often used the clause \"imprisonment without right to correspondence\": the person sentenced never had a chance to correspond with anyone because soon after imprisonment they would be shot. As early as 1939, Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich used the term \"Sonderbehandlung\" (\"special treatment\") to mean summary execution (most likely by hanging) of persons viewed as \"disciplinary problems\" by the Nazis even before commencing the systematic extermination of the Jews. Heinrich Himmler, aware that the word had come to be known to mean murder, replaced that euphemism with one in which Jews would be \"guided\" (to their deaths) through the slave-labor and extermination camps after having been \"evacuated\" to their doom. Such was part of the formulation of \"Endlösung der Judenfrage\" (the \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\"), which became infamous to the entire world during the Nuremberg Trials.\n\nA euphemism may itself devolve into a taboo word, through the linguistic process known as semantic change (specifically pejoration) described by W. V. O. Quine, and more recently dubbed the \"euphemism treadmill\" by Harvard professor Steven Pinker. For instance, \"toilet\" is an 18th-century euphemism, replacing the older euphemism \"house-of-office\", which in turn replaced the even older euphemisms \"privy-house\" and \"bog-house\". In the 20th century, where the words \"lavatory\" or \"toilet\" were deemed inappropriate (e.g. in the United States), they were sometimes replaced with \"bathroom\" or \"water closet\", which in turn became \"restroom\", \"W.C.\", or \"washroom\".\n\nThe word \"shit\" appears to have originally been a euphemism for defecation in Pre-Germanic, as the Proto-Indo-European root *\"sḱeyd-\", from which it was derived, meant \"to cut off\".\n\nEuphemisms are at risk of being misunderstood and used literally by young children who are acquiring language, and by older people who are learning a foreign language; an example is the \"pregnant fireman\" type of children's solecism.\n\nDoublespeak is a term sometimes used for deliberate euphemistic misuse of words to distort or reverse their meaning, as in a \"Ministry of Peace\" which wages war, and a \"Ministry of Love\" which imprisons and tortures. It is a portmanteau of the terms \"Newspeak\" and \"doublethink\", which originate from George Orwell's novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\".\n\nThe word \"euphemism\" itself can be used as a euphemism. In the animated TV special \"Halloween Is Grinch Night\" (see Dr. Seuss), a child asks to go to the \"euphemism\", where \"euphemism\" is being used as a euphemism for \"outhouse\". This euphemistic use of \"euphemism\" also occurred in the play \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" where a character requests, \"Martha, will you show her where we keep the, uh, euphemism?\"\n\nIn Wes Anderson's film \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", the replacement of swear words by the word \"cuss\" became a humorous motif throughout the film.\n\nIn Tom Hanks's web series \"Electric City\", the use of profanity has been censored by the word \"expletive\". \"[Expletive deleted]\" entered public discourse after its notorious use in censoring transcripts of the Watergate tapes.\n\nIn Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" series, the curses of the scientist Ebling Mis have all been replaced with the word \"unprintable\". In fact, there is only one case of his curses being referred to as such, leading some readers to mistakenly assume that the euphemism is Ebling's, rather than Asimov's. The same word has also been used in his short story \"Flies\".\n\nGeorge Carlin has stated in audio books and his stand-up shows that euphemisms soften everyday language and take the life out of it.\n\n"}
{"id": "23569553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23569553", "title": "Gaziel", "text": "Gaziel\n\nAgustí Calvet Pascual (; Sant Feliu de Guíxols; October 7, 1887 – Barcelona; April 12, 1964), known as Gaziel (), was a Spanish journalist, writer and publisher.\n\nHe studied humanities in Barcelona and in Madrid, where he earned his doctorate. His doctoral thesis was on Anselm Turmeda, and was published in 1914 as \"Fray Anselmo de Turmeda. Heterodoxo español 1352-1423-32?\".\n\nHe then went to Paris to further his studies and, at the outbreak of the First World War, he acted as war correspondent for \"La Vanguardia\", the most influential newspaper in Barcelona, with such a success that very shortly most of his articles were brought together and published in four successive books: \"Diario de un estudiante en París (Diary of a student in Paris)\" (1916), \"Narraciones de tierras heroicas (Tales of heroic lands)\" (1916), \"De París a Monastir (From Paris to Monastir)\" (1917) and \"En las líneas de fuego (In the fire lines)\" (1917); and he became a full-time journalist. It was then when he began to use Gaziel as pseudonym. He had married a French lady in 1914.\n\nAfter the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, he showed himself as a firm pro-republican, but after 1934 he became increasingly disappointed and anxious over the social and political atmosphere in Spain. \n\nIn those years preceding the Spanish civil war Gaziel was appointed editor in chief of \"La Vanguardia\", and he was widely seen as the most incisive political analyst in Spain. At the beginning of the war, in July 1936, he had to flee to France, as his life was in risk due to the political repression led by anarchist and Communist militias, while his home in Barcelona, including his valuable personal library, was sacked.\n\nHe was in Brussels when the German invasion in 1940 forced him to return to Spain, where he was received with undisguised hostility by the new Francoist authorities, despite having been the cultural attaché of their Embassy in Belgium and having signed in 1937 a manifesto -promoted by Francesc Cambó- in support of the nationalist side in the Civil War; while Carlos Godó, the owner of \"La Vanguardia\", prevented him from returning to his position in the newspaper. As a consequence he lived in Madrid, as general manager of the \"Editorial Plus Ultra\" publishing house. \n\nIn the late 1940s, he wrote \"Meditaciones en el desierto (Meditations in the desert)\", a depressing view on the situation of Spain and, more generally, of Europe in the postwar years.\n\nIn the early 1950s, he travelled through Castile, Galicia and Portugal. As a result of these travels he wrote, and published a decade later, his so-called Iberian trilogy: \"Portugal lejano (Portugal far away)\", \"Castilla adentro (Castile inside)\" and \"La península inacabada (The unfinished peninsula)\", where he mixed the interesting diaries of these trips with his profound reflections on the historical and political coexistence between Portugal, Catalonia and Castile (or Spain in a broader sense), an issue that worried him all along his life. \n\n\"La peninsula inacabada\" includes also a very significant extensive soliloquy: While he spends a spring afternoon in the delightful beach of Estoril, he looks sadly over his life and the three wars (First World War, Spanish Civil War, Second World War) he witnessed, and over the contemporary European situation, including the Indochina War where his eldest son was fighting in the ranks of the French Army. \n\nTwo professional travels, to Switzerland and Italy, to attend International Publishers Congresses produced two respective books, \"Seny, treball i llibertat\" (\"Sensibleness, work and freedom\") and \"L'home és el tot\" (\"The man is everything\"). In the first one, perhaps his masterpiece, he displayed his absolute admiration for the Swiss political and social structure, that he thought as the ideal answer to the regional complexities of Spain. In the second one he showed himself captivated by the magnificent renaissance art in Florence and took the opportunity to express his most profound aversion to the mass society.\n\nIn 1959, after his retirement from Editorial Plus Ultra, Gaziel moved back to Barcelona, where he resumed on a full-time basis his writing activity. His reappearance in the Catalan literary arena, at age seventy-two, surprised the cultural Establishment of Barcelona. Just before his death, in 1964, he finished \"Història de La Vanguardia (1881–1936)\" (\"History of La Vanguardia (1881–1936)\"), a key book in the history of Spanish journalism and Gaziel's personal settling of scores with Carlos Godó.\n\nIn October 2009, a new compilation of Gaziel's articles on the First World War, including several ones not collected in the 1915–1917 books, \"En las trincheras (In the trenches)\", was published.\n\nGaziel wrote with equal elegance in either Catalan or Spanish (actually he published eight works in Spanish and fourteen in Catalan, while his almost daily writing in \"La Vanguardia\" along twelve years was in Spanish); and while he always saw himself as a genuine Catalan he never fully backed the Catalan nationalism, as he made clear in his posthumous work, \"Quina mena de gent som (What kind of people are we)\". Although strictly speaking he did not belong to the Noucentisme Catalan cultural movement, he was close to it and always admired Eugeni d'Ors and, above all, Enric Prat de la Riba.\n\nOn the other hand, since his youth he was a wholehearted francophile, a stance that was still increased along the rest of his life, although he always deeply regretted the general French ignorance, or disdain, of the Catalonia under French administration history and specificity or even of its mere existence. On the contrary, in the second half of his life he developed a clear socio-cultural, not political, antiamericanism. Also he took a really negative view of the Latin-American establishments following a very frustrating experience around a publishing business he tried to undertake in Colombia in the early forties. \n\nAll in all, Gaziel was, first and foremost, a liberal, conservative, eurocentric bourgeois, and, like many cultured men of his time, he was well aware of the dramatic, and to them disappointing, changes the world had experienced along the first half of the 20th century, to the point that in \"Portugal far away\" he wrote: \"I am not any more a man of the present times, neither of the future\".\n\n\n\n"}

Lines of translatable Gnommish run along the bottoms of books one, two, four, five and six. However, in book one of the series, it is mentioned that one of the symbols was comparable to the Egyptian Anubis symbol. It is also mentioned that Gnommish is a mix of symbolic and alphabetic letters, running in spirals (but since reading in spirals gives most fairies migraines, most modern fairy script is arranged in horizontal lines).\n\nA string of Gnommish symbols appears at the bottom of each page of \"Artemis Fowl\". It comprises a substitution cipher which can be deciphered using sections of the book's text displayed in Gnommish, together with their English translations.

P'shóg is the Gnommish word for sprite, used in Book 1 by Artemis Fowl II while talking to the sprite in Ho Chi Minh City. He also uses the word ka-dalun, meaning fairy. D'Arvit is a Gnommish curse word. Book 1 declares after the first appearance of the word \"D'Arvit\" that, \"There is no point translating that word as it would have to be censored.\" It is often used in the series to replace real profanity, likely to be in the place of a swearword.

Also it is revealed that in Gnommish, for a conversion from a verb (for example, plunder- ffurfor) to a noun (plunderer- ffuforfer), the suffix -fer is added. It is noted that this is similar to the English way of adding the suffix -er, hence implying that one was derived from the other.\n\n"}

This conjecture is named after Heiko Harborth, and (if true) would strengthen Fáry's theorem on the existence of straight-line drawings for every planar graph. For this reason, a drawing with integer edge lengths is also known as an integral Fáry embedding. Despite much subsequent research, Harborth's conjecture remains unsolved.\n\nAlthough Harborth's conjecture is not known to be true for all planar graphs, it has been proven for several special kinds of planar graph.\n\nOne class of graphs that have integral Fáry embeddings are the graphs that can be reduced to the empty graph by a sequence of operations of two types:\nFor such a graph, a rational Fáry embedding can be constructed incrementally by reversing this removal process, using the facts that the set of points that are at a rational distance from two given points are dense in the plane, and that if three points have rational distance between one pair and square-root-of-rational distance between the other two pairs, then the points at rational distances from all three are again dense in the plane. The distances in such an embedding can be made into integers by scaling the embedding by an appropriate factor. Based on this construction, the graphs known to have integral Fáry embeddings include the bipartite planar graphs, (2,1)-sparse planar graphs, planar graphs of treewidth at most 3, and graphs of degree at most four that either contain a diamond subgraph or are not 4-edge-connected.\n\nIn particular, the graphs that can be reduced to the empty graph by the removal only of vertices of degree at most two (the 2-degenerate planar graphs) include both the outerplanar graphs and the series-parallel graphs. However, for the outerplanar graphs a more direct construction of integral Fáry embeddings is possible, based on the existence of infinite subsets of the unit circle in which all distances are rational.\n\nAdditionally, integral Fáry embeddings are known for each of the five Platonic solids.\n\nA stronger version of Harborth's conjecture, posed by , asks whether every planar graph has a planar drawing in which the vertex coordinates as well as the edge lengths are all integers. It is known to be true for 3-regular graphs, for graphs that have maximum degree 4 but are not 4-regular, and for planar 3-trees.\n\nAnother unsolved problem in geometry, the Erdős–Ulam problem, concerns the existence of dense subsets of the plane in which all distances are rational numbers. If such a subset existed, it would form a universal point set that could be used to draw all planar graphs with rational edge lengths (and therefore, after scaling them appropriately, with integer edge lengths). However, Ulam conjectured that dense rational-distance sets do not exist.\nAccording to the Erdős–Anning theorem, infinite non-collinear point sets with all distances being integers cannot exist. This does not rule out the existence of sets with all distances rational, but it does imply that in any such set the denominators of the rational distances must grow arbitrarily large.\n\n"}
{"id": "14240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14240", "title": "Hawaiian language", "text": "Hawaiian language\n\nThe Hawaiian language (Hawaiian: \"\", ) is a Polynesian language that takes its name from Hawaii, the largest island in the tropical North Pacific archipelago where it developed. Hawaiian, along with English, is an official language of the State of Hawaii. King Kamehameha III established the first Hawaiian-language constitution in 1839 and 1840.\n\nFor various reasons, including territorial legislation establishing English as the official language in schools, the number of native speakers of Hawaiian gradually decreased during the period from the 1830s to the 1950s. Hawaiian was essentially displaced by English on six of seven inhabited islands. In 2001, native speakers of Hawaiian amounted to less than 0.1% of the statewide population. Linguists were unsure that Hawaiian and other endangered languages would survive.\n\nNevertheless, from around 1949 to the present day, there has been a gradual increase in attention to and promotion of the language. Public Hawaiian-language immersion preschools called Pūnana Leo were established in 1984; other immersion schools followed soon after that. The first students to start in immersion preschool have now graduated from college and many are fluent Hawaiian speakers. The federal government has acknowledged this development. For example, the Hawaiian National Park Language Correction Act of 2000 changed the names of several national parks in Hawaii, observing the Hawaiian spelling. However, the language is still classified as critically endangered by UNESCO.\n\nA creole language spoken in Hawaii is Hawaiian Pidgin (or Hawaii Creole English, HCE). It should not be mistaken for the Hawaiian language nor for a dialect of English.\n\nThe Hawaiian alphabet has 13 letters: five vowels (each with a long pronunciation and a short one) and eight consonants, one of which is the glottal stop called okina.\n\nThe Hawaiian language takes its name from the largest island in the Hawaiian state, Hawaii (\"\" in the Hawaiian language). The island name was first written in English in 1778 by British explorer James Cook and his crew members. They wrote it as \"Owhyhee\" or \"Owhyee\". Explorers Mortimer (1791) and Otto von Kotzebue (1821) used that spelling.\n\nThe initial \"O\" in the name is a reflection of the fact that unique identity is predicated in Hawaiian by using a copula form, \"o\", immediately before a proper noun. Thus, in Hawaiian, the name of the island is expressed by saying \"\", which means \"[This] is Hawaii.\" The Cook expedition also wrote \"Otaheite\" rather than \"Tahiti.\"\n\nThe spelling \"why\" in the name reflects the pronunciation of \"wh\" in 18th-century English (still used in parts of the English-speaking world). \"Why\" was pronounced . The spelling \"hee\" or \"ee\" in the name represents the sounds , or .\n\nPutting the parts together, \"O-why-(h)ee\" reflects , a reasonable approximation of the native pronunciation, .\n\nAmerican missionaries bound for Hawaii used the phrases \"Owhihe Language\" and \"Owhyhee language\" in Boston prior to their departure in October 1819 and during their five-month voyage to Hawaii. They still used such phrases as late as March 1822. However, by July 1823, they had begun using the phrase \"Hawaiian Language.\"\n\nIn Hawaiian, \"\" means \"Hawaiian language\", as adjectives follow nouns.\n\nHawaiian is a Polynesian member of the Austronesian language family. It is closely related to other Polynesian languages, such as Samoan, Marquesan, Tahitian, Māori, Rapa Nui (the language of Easter Island) and Tongan.\n\nAccording to Schütz (1994), the Marquesans colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 CE followed by later waves of immigration from the Society Islands and Samoa-Tonga. Their languages, over time, became the Hawaiian language within the Hawaiian Islands. Kimura and Wilson (1983) also state: \"Linguists agree that Hawaiian is closely related to Eastern Polynesian, with a particularly strong link in the Southern Marquesas, and a secondary link in Tahiti, which may be explained by voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands.\"\n\nThe genetic history of the Hawaiian language is demonstrated primarily through the application of lexicostatistics, which involves quantitative comparison of lexical cognates, and the comparative method. Both the number of cognates and the phonological similarity of cognates are measures of language relationship.\n\nThe following table provides a limited lexicostatistical data set for ten numbers. The asterisk (*) is used to show that these are hypothetical, reconstructed forms. In the table, the year date of the modern forms is rounded off to 2000 CE to emphasize the 6000-year time lapse since the PAN era.\n\nNote: For the number \"10\", the Tongan form in the table is part of the word ('ten'). The Hawaiian cognate is part of the word ('ten days'); however, the more common word for \"10\" used in counting and quantifying is , a different root.\n\nApplication of the lexicostatistical method to the data in the table will show the four languages to be related to one another, with Tagalog having 100% cognacy with PAN, while Hawaiian and Tongan have 100% cognacy with each other, but 90% with Tagalog and PAN. This is because the forms for each number are cognates, except the Hawaiian and Tongan words for the number \"1\", which are cognate with each other, but not with Tagalog and PAN. When the full set of 200 meanings is used, the percentages will be much lower. For example, Elbert found Hawaiian and Tongan to have 49% (98 ÷ 200) shared cognacy. This points out the importance of data-set size for this method, where less data leads to cruder results, while more data leads to better results.\n\nApplication of the comparative method will show partly different genetic relationships. It will point out sound changes, such as:\nThis method will recognize sound change #1 as a shared innovation of Hawaiian and Tongan. It will also take the Hawaiian and Tongan cognates for \"1\" as another shared innovation. Due to these exclusively shared features, Hawaiian and Tongan are found to be more closely related to one another than either is to Tagalog or PAN.\n\nThe forms in the table show that the Austronesian vowels tend to be relatively stable, while the consonants are relatively volatile. It is also apparent that the Hawaiian words for \"3\", \"5\", and \"8\" have remained essentially unchanged for 6000 years.\n\nIn 1778, British explorer James Cook made Europe's initial, recorded first contact with Hawaiʻi, beginning a new phase in the development of Hawaiian. During the next forty years, the sounds of Spanish (1789), Russian (1804), French (1816), and German (1816) arrived in Hawaii via other explorers and businessmen. Hawaiian began to be written for the first time, largely restricted to isolated names and words, and word lists collected by explorers and travelers.\n\nThe early explorers and merchants who first brought European languages to the Hawaiian islands also took on a few native crew members who brought the Hawaiian language into new territory. Hawaiians took these nautical jobs because their traditional way of life changed due to plantations, and although there were not enough of these Hawaiian-speaking explorers to establish any viable speech communities abroad, they still had a noticeable presence. One of them, a boy in his teens known as Obookiah (), had a major impact on the future of the language. He sailed to New England, where he eventually became a student at the Foreign Mission School in Cornwall, Connecticut. He inspired New Englanders to support a Christian mission to Hawaii, and provided information on the Hawaiian language to the American missionaries there prior to their departure for Hawaii in 1819.\n\nLike all natural spoken languages, the Hawaiian language was originally just an oral language. The native people of the Hawaiian language relayed religion, traditions, history, and views of their world through stories that were handed down from generation to generation. One form of storytelling most commonly associated with the Hawaiian islands is hula. Nathaniel B. Emerson notes that \"It kept the communal imagination in living touch with the nation's legendary past\".\n\nThe islanders' connection with their stories is argued to be one reason why Captain James Cook received a pleasant welcome. Marshall Sahlins has observed that Hawaiian folktales began bearing similar content to those of the Western world in the eighteenth century. He argues this was caused by the timing of Captain Cook's arrival, which was coincidentally when the indigenous Hawaiians were celebrating the Makahiki festival. The islanders' story foretold of the god Lono's return at the time of the Makahiki festival.\n\nIn 1820, Protestant missionaries from New England arrived in Hawaii. \n\nAdelbert von Chamisso might have consulted with a native speaker of Hawaiian in Berlin, Germany, before publishing his grammar of Hawaiian (\"\") in 1837. When Hawaiian King David Kalākaua took a trip around the world, he brought his native language with him. When his wife, Queen Kapiolani, and his sister, Princess (later Queen) Liliuokalani, took a trip across North America and on to the British Islands, in 1887, Liliuokalani's composition \"Aloha Oe\" was already a famous song in the U.S.\nIn 1834, the first Hawaiian-language newspapers were published by missionaries working with locals. The missionaries also played a significant role in publishing a vocabulary (1836) grammar (1854) and dictionary (1865) of Hawaiian. Literacy in Hawaiian was widespread among the local population, especially ethnic Hawaiians. Use of the language among the general population might have peaked around 1881. Even so, some people worried, as early as 1854, that the language was \"soon destined to extinction.\"\n\nThe decline of the Hawaiian language dates back to a coup that overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and dethroned the existing Hawaiian queen. Thereafter, a law was instituted that banned the Hawaiian language from being taught. The law cited as banning the Hawaiian language is identified as Act 57, sec. 30 of the 1896 Laws of the Republic of Hawaii:\n\nThis law established English as the medium of instruction for the government-recognized schools both \"public and private\". While it did not ban or make illegal the Hawaiian language in other contexts, its implementation in the schools had far-reaching effects. Those who had been pushing for English-only schools took this law as licence to extinguish the native language at the early education level. While the law stopped short of making Hawaiian illegal (it was still the dominant language spoken at the time), many children who spoke Hawaiian at school, including on the playground, were disciplined. This included corporal punishment and going to the home of the offending child to strongly advise them to stop speaking it in their home. Moreover, the law specifically provided for teaching languages \"in addition to the English language,\" reducing Hawaiian to the status of a foreign language, subject to approval by the Department. Hawaiian was not taught initially in any school, including the all-Hawaiian Kamehameha Schools. This is largely because when these schools were founded, like Kamehameha Schools founded in 1887 (nine years before this law), Hawaiian was being spoken in the home. Once this law was enacted, individuals at these institutions took it upon themselves to enforce a ban on Hawaiian. Beginning in 1900, Mary Kawena Pukui, who was later the co-author of the Hawaiian–English Dictionary, was punished for speaking Hawaiian by being rapped on the forehead, allowed to eat only bread and water for lunch, and denied home visits on holidays. Winona Beamer was expelled from Kamehameha Schools in 1937 for chanting Hawaiian.\n\nIn 1949, the legislature of the Territory of Hawaii commissioned Mary Pukui and Samuel Elbert to write a new dictionary of Hawaiian, either revising the Andrews-Parker work or starting from scratch. Pukui and Elbert took a middle course, using what they could from the Andrews dictionary, but making certain improvements and additions that were more significant than a minor revision. The dictionary they produced, in 1957, introduced an era of gradual increase in attention to the language and culture.\n\nEfforts to promote the language have increased in recent decades. Hawaiian-language \"immersion\" schools are now open to children whose families want to reintroduce Hawaiian language for future generations. The Aha Pūnana Leo’s Hawaiian language preschools in Hilo, Hawaii, have received international recognition. The local National Public Radio station features a short segment titled \"Hawaiian word of the day\" and a Hawaiian language news broadcast. Honolulu television station KGMB ran a weekly Hawaiian language program, \"Āhai Ōlelo Ola\", as recently as 2010. Additionally, the Sunday editions of the \"Honolulu Star-Advertiser\", the largest newspaper in Hawaii, feature a brief article called \"Kauakukalahale\" written entirely in Hawaiian by teachers, students, and community members.\n\nToday, the number of native speakers of Hawaiian, which was under 0.1% of the statewide population in 1997, has risen to 2,000, out of 24,000 total who are fluent in the language, according to the US 2011 census. On six of the seven permanently inhabited islands, Hawaiian has been largely displaced by English, but on Niihau, native speakers of Hawaiian have remained fairly isolated and have continued to use Hawaiian almost exclusively.\n\nThe isolated island of Niʻihau, located off the southwest coast of Kauai, is the one island where Hawaiian is still spoken as the language of daily life. \n\nHawaiians had no written language prior to Western contact, except for petroglyph symbols.\nThe modern Hawaiian alphabet, \"ka pīāpā Hawaii\", is based on the Latin script. Hawaiian words end \"only\" in vowels, and every consonant must be followed by a vowel. The Hawaiian alphabetical order has all of the vowels before the consonants, as in the following chart.\nThis writing system was developed by American Protestant missionaries during 1820–1826. It was the first thing they ever printed in Hawaii, on January 7, 1822, and it originally included the consonants \"B, D, R, T,\" and \"V,\" in addition to the current ones (\"H, K, L, M, N, P, W\"), and it had \"F, G, S, Y\" and \"Z\" for \"spelling foreign words\". The initial printing also showed the five vowel letters (\"A, E, I, O, U\") and seven of the short diphthongs (\"AE, AI, AO, AU, EI, EU, OU\").\n\nIn 1826, the developers voted to eliminate some of the letters which represented functionally redundant allophones (called \"interchangeable letters\"), enabling the Hawaiian alphabet to approach the ideal state of one-symbol-one-phoneme, and thereby optimizing the ease with which people could teach and learn the reading and writing of Hawaiian. For example, instead of spelling one and the same word as \"pule, bule, pure,\" and \"bure\" (because of interchangeable \"p/b\" and \"l/r\"), the word is spelled only as \"pule\".\n\nHowever, hundreds of words were very rapidly borrowed into Hawaiian from English, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and Syriac. Although these loan words were necessarily Hawaiianized, they often retained some of their \"non-Hawaiian letters\" in their published forms. For example, \"Brazil\" fully Hawaiianized is \"Palakila\", but retaining \"foreign letters\" it is \"Barazila\". Another example is \"Gibraltar\", written as \"Kipalaleka\" or \"Gibaraleta\". While and are not regarded as Hawaiian sounds, , , and were represented in the original alphabet, so the letters (\"b\", \"r\", and \"t\") for the latter are not truly \"non-Hawaiian\" or \"foreign\", even though their post-1826 use in published matter generally marked words of foreign origin.\n\n\"ʻOkina\" (\"oki\" 'cut' + \"-na\" '-ing') is the modern Hawaiian name for the symbol (a letter) that represents the glottal stop. It was formerly known as \"uina\" ('snap').\n\nFor examples of the okina, consider the Hawaiian words \"Hawaii\" and \"Oahu\" (often simply \"Hawaii\" and \"Oahu\" in English orthography). In Hawaiian, these words can be pronounced and , and can be written with an okina where the glottal stop is pronounced.\n\nElbert & Pukui's \"Hawaiian Grammar\" says \"The glottal stop, ‘, is made by closing the glottis or space between the vocal cords, the result being something like the hiatus in English \"oh-oh\".\"\n\nAs early as 1823, the missionaries made some limited use of the apostrophe to represent the glottal stop, but they did not make it a letter of the alphabet. In publishing the Hawaiian Bible, they used it to distinguish \"kou\" ('my') from \"kou\" ('your'). In 1864, William DeWitt Alexander published a grammar of Hawaiian in which he made it clear that the glottal stop (calling it \"guttural break\") is definitely a true consonant of the Hawaiian language. He wrote it using an apostrophe. In 1922, the Andrews-Parker dictionary of Hawaiian made limited use of the opening single quote symbol, called \"reversed apostrophe\" or \"inverse comma\", to represent the glottal stop. Subsequent dictionaries have preferred to use that symbol. Today, many native speakers of Hawaiian do not bother, in general, to write any symbol for the glottal stop. Its use is advocated mainly among students and teachers of Hawaiian as a second language, and among linguists.\n\nThe okina is written in various ways for electronic uses:\n\nBecause many people who want to write the ʻokina are not familiar with these specific characters and/or do not have access to the appropriate fonts and input and display systems, it is sometimes written with more familiar and readily available characters:\n\nA modern Hawaiian name for the macron symbol is \"kahakō\" (\"kaha\" 'mark' + \"kō\" 'long'). It was formerly known as \"mekona\" (Hawaiianization of \"macron\"). It can be written as a diacritical mark which looks like a hyphen or dash written above a vowel, i.e., \"ā ē ī ō ū\" and \"Ā Ē Ī Ō Ū\". It is used to show that the marked vowel is a \"double\", or \"geminate\", or \"long\" vowel, in phonological terms. (See: Vowel length)\n\nAs early as 1821, at least one of the missionaries, Hiram Bingham, was using macrons (and breves) in making handwritten transcriptions of Hawaiian vowels. The missionaries specifically requested their sponsor in Boston to send them some type (fonts) with accented vowel characters, including vowels with macrons, but the sponsor made only one response and sent the wrong font size (pica instead of small pica). Thus, they could not print ā, ē, ī, ō, nor ū (at the right size), even though they wanted to.\n\nDue to extensive allophony, Hawaiian has more than 13 phones. Although vowel length is phonemic, long vowels are not always pronounced as such, even though under the rules for assigning stress in Hawaiian, a long vowel will always receive stress.\n\nHawaiian is known for having very few consonant phonemes – eight: . It is notable that Hawaiian has allophonic variation of with , with , and (in some dialects) with . The – variation is quite unusual among the world's languages, and is likely a product both of the small number of consonants in Hawaiian, and the recent shift of historical *t to modern –, after historical *k had shifted to . In some dialects, remains as in some words. These variations are largely free, though there are conditioning factors. tends to especially in words with both and , such as in the island name \"Lānai\" (–), though this is not always the case: \"eleele\" or \"eneene\" \"black\". The allophone is almost universal at the beginnings of words, whereas is most common before the vowel . is also the norm after and , whereas is usual after and . After and initially, however, and are in free variation. \"A consonant occurs only before a vowel; thus two consonants never occur in succession and a syllable always ends with a vowel\".\n\nHawaiian has five short and five long vowels, plus diphthongs.\n\nHawaiian has five pure vowels. The short vowels are , and the long vowels, if they are considered separate phonemes rather than simply sequences of like vowels, are . When stressed, short and have been described as becoming and , while when unstressed they are and . Parker Jones (2017), however, did not find a reduction of /a/ to in the phonetic analysis of a young speaker from Hilo, Hawaiʻi; so there is at least some variation in how /a/ is realised. also tends to become next to , , and another , as in \"Pele\" . Some grammatical particles vary between short and long vowels. These include \"a\" and \"o\" \"of\", \"ma\" \"at\", \"na\" and \"no\" \"for\". Between a back vowel or and a following non-back vowel (), there is an epenthetic , which is generally not written. Between a front vowel or and a following non-front vowel (), there is an epenthetic (a \"y\" sound), which is never written.\n\nThe short-vowel diphthongs are . In all except perhaps , these are falling diphthongs. However, they are not as tightly bound as the diphthongs of English, and may be considered vowel sequences. (The second vowel in such sequences may receive the stress, but in such cases it is not counted as a diphthong.) In fast speech, tends to and tends to , conflating these diphthongs with and .\n\nThere are only a limited number of vowels which may follow long vowels, and some authors treat these sequences as diphthongs as well: .\n\nHawaiian syllable structure is (C)V. All CV syllables occur except for \"wū\"; \"wu\" occurs only in two words borrowed from English. As shown by Schütz, Hawaiian word-stress is predictable in words of one to four syllables, but not in words of five or more syllables. Hawaiian phonological processes include palatalization and deletion of consonants, as well as raising, diphthongization, deletion, and compensatory lengthening of vowels. Phonological reduction (or \"decay\") of consonant phonemes during the historical development of the language has resulted in the phonemic glottal stop. Ultimate loss (deletion) of intervocalic consonant phonemes has resulted in Hawaiian long vowels and diphthongs.\n\nHawaiian is an analytic language with verb–subject–object word order. While there is no use of inflection for verbs, in Hawaiian, like other Austronesian personal pronouns, declension is found in the differentiation between a- and o-class genitive case personal pronouns in order to indicate inalienable possession in a binary possessive class system. Also like many Austronesian languages, Hawaiian pronouns employ separate words for inclusive and exclusive we (clusivity), and distinguish singular, dual, and plural. The grammatical function of verbs is marked by adjacent particles (short words) and by their relative positions, that indicate tense–aspect–mood.\n\nSome examples of verb phrase patterns:\n\nNouns can be marked with articles:\n\n\"ka\" and \"ke\" are singular definite articles. \"ke\" is used before words beginning with a-, e-, o- and k-, and with some words beginning - and p-. \"ka\" is used in all other cases. \"nā\" is the plural definite article.\n\nTo show part of a group, the word \"kekahi\" is used. To show a bigger part, \"mau\" is inserted to pluralize the subject.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n"}

Indirect agonists work through varying mechanisms to achieve their effects, including transporter blockade, induction of transmitter release, and inhibition of transmitter breakdown.\n\nCocaine is a monoamine transporter blocker and, thus, an indirect agonist of dopamine receptors. Cocaine binds the dopamine transporter (DAT), blocking the protein's ability to uptake dopamine from the synaptic cleft and also blocking DAT from terminating dopamine signaling. Blockage of DAT increases the extracellular concentration of dopamine, therefore increasing the amount of dopamine receptor binding and signaling.\n\nDipyridamole inhibits reuptake of adenosine, resulting in greater extracellular concentrations of adenosine. Dipyridamole also inhibits the enzyme adenosine deaminase, the enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of adenosine.\n\nFenfluramine is an indirect agonist of serotonin receptors. Fenfluramine binds to the serotonin transporter, blocking serotonin reuptake. However, fenfluramine also acts to induce non-exocytotic serotonin release; in a mechanism similar to that of methamphetamine in dopamine neurons, fenfluramine binds to VMAT2, disrupting the compartmentalization of serotonin into vesicles and increasing the concentration of cytoplasmic serotonin available for drug-induced release.\n"}

At a cellular level, involution is characterized by the process of proteolysis of the basement membrane (basal lamina), leading to epithelial regression and apoptosis, with accompanying stromal fibrosis. The consequent reduction in cell number and reorganization of stromal tissue leads to the reduction in the size of the organ.\n\nThe thymus continues to grow between birth and puberty and then begins to atrophy, a process directed by the high levels of circulating sex hormones. Proportional to thymic size, thymic activity (T cell output) is most active before puberty. Upon atrophy, the size and activity are dramatically reduced, and the organ is primarily replaced with fat. The atrophy is due to the increased circulating level of sex hormones, and chemical or physical castration of an adult results in the thymus increasing in size and activity.\n\nInvolution is the process by which the uterus is transformed from pregnant to non-pregnant state. This period is characterized by the restoration of ovarian function in order to prepare the body for a new pregnancy. It is a physiological process occurring after parturition; the hypertrophy of the uterus has to be undone since it does not need to house the fetus anymore. This process is primarily due to the hormone oxytocin. The completion of this period is defined as when the diameter of the uterus returns to the size it is normally during a woman's menstrual cycle.\n\nDuring pregnancy until after birth, mammary glands grow steadily to a size required for optimal milk production. At the end of breastfeeding, the number of cells in the mammary gland becomes reduced until approximately the same number is reached as before the start of pregnancy.\n\n"}
{"id": "588546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588546", "title": "James R. Schlesinger", "text": "James R. Schlesinger\n\nJames Rodney Schlesinger (February 15, 1929 – March 27, 2014) was an American economist and public servant who was best known for serving as Secretary of Defense from 1973 to 1975 under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He became America's first Secretary of Energy under Jimmy Carter.\n\nWhile Secretary of Defense, he opposed amnesty for draft resisters and pressed for development of more sophisticated nuclear weapon systems. Additionally, his support for the A-10 and the lightweight fighter program (later the F-16) helped ensure that they were carried to completion.\n\nJames Rodney Schlesinger was born in New York City, the son of Jewish parents, Rhea Lillian (née Rogen) and Julius Schlesinger. His mother was a Lithuanian emigrant from what was then part of the Russian Empire and his father's family was from Austria. He converted to Lutheranism in his early 20s. Schlesinger was educated at the Horace Mann School and Harvard University, where he earned a B.A. (1950), M.A. (1952), and Ph.D. (1956) in economics. Between 1955 and 1963 he taught economics at the University of Virginia and in 1960 published \"The Political Economy of National Security.\" In 1963, he moved to the RAND Corporation, where he worked until 1969, in the later years as director of strategic studies.\n\nIn 1969, Schlesinger joined the Nixon administration as assistant director of the Bureau of the Budget, devoting most of his time to Defense matters. In 1971, President Nixon appointed Schlesinger a member of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and designated him as chairman. Serving in this position for about a year and a half, Schlesinger instituted extensive organizational and management changes in an effort to improve the AEC's regulatory performance. On February 2, 1973, he became Director of Central Intelligence.\n\nSchlesinger left the CIA to become Secretary of Defense on July 2, aged 44. As a university professor, researcher at Rand, and government official in three agencies, he had acquired an impressive resume in national security affairs.\n\nShortly after assuming office, Schlesinger outlined the basic objectives that would guide his administration: maintain a \"strong defense establishment\"; \"assure the military balance so necessary to deterrence and a more enduring peace\"; obtain for members of the military \"the respect, dignity and support that are their due\"; assume \"an . . . obligation to use our citizens' resources wisely\"; and \"become increasingly competitive with potential adversaries... [W]e must not be forced out of the market on land, at sea, or in the air. Eli Whitney belongs to us, not to our competitors.\" In particular, Schlesinger saw a need in the post-Vietnam era to restore the morale and prestige of the military services; modernize strategic doctrine and programs; step up research and development; and shore up a DoD budget that had been declining since 1968.\n\nAnalyzing strategy, Schlesinger maintained that the theory and practice of the 1950s and 1960s had been overtaken by events, particularly the rise of the Soviet Union to virtual nuclear parity with the United States and the effect this development had on the concept of deterrence. Schlesinger believed that \"deterrence is not a substitute for defense; defense capabilities, representing the potential for effective counteraction, are the essential condition of deterrence.\" He had grave doubts about the assured destruction strategy, which relied on massive nuclear attacks against an enemy's urban-industrial areas. Credible strategic nuclear deterrence, the secretary felt, depended on fulfilling several conditions: maintaining essential equivalence with the Soviet Union in force effectiveness; maintaining a highly survivable force that could be withheld or targeted against an enemy's economic base in order to deter coercive or desperation attacks against U.S. population or economic targets; establishing a fast-response force that could act to deter additional enemy attacks; and establishing a range of capabilities sufficient to convince all nations that the United States was equal to its strongest competitors.\n\nTo meet these needs, Schlesinger built on existing ideas in developing a flexible response nuclear strategy, which, with the President's approval, he made public by early 1974. The United States, Schlesinger said, needed the ability, in the event of a nuclear attack, to respond so as to \"limit the chances of uncontrolled escalation\" and \"hit meaningful targets\" without causing widespread collateral damage. The nation's assured destruction force would be withheld in the hope that the enemy would not attack U.S. cities. In rejecting assured destruction, Schlesinger quoted President Nixon: \"Should a President, in the event of a nuclear attack, be left with the single option of ordering the mass destruction of enemy civilians, in the face of the certainty that it would be followed by the mass slaughter of Americans?\"\n\nWith this approach, Schlesinger moved to a partial counterforce policy, emphasizing Soviet military targets such as ICBM missile installations, avoiding initial attacks on population centers, and minimizing unintended collateral damage. He explicitly disavowed any intention to acquire a destabilizing first-strike capability against the USSR. But he wanted \"an offensive capability of such size and composition that all will perceive it as in overall balance with the strategic forces of any potential opponent.\"\n\nSchlesinger devoted much attention to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, citing the need to strengthen its conventional capabilities. He rejected the old assumption that NATO did not need a direct counter to Warsaw Pact conventional forces because it could rely on tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, noting that the approximate nuclear parity between the United States and the Soviets in the 1970s made this stand inappropriate. He rejected the argument that NATO could not afford a conventional counterweight to Warsaw Pact forces. In his discussions with NATO leaders, Schlesinger promoted the concept of burden-sharing, stressing the troubles that the United States faced in the mid-1970s because of an unfavorable balance of international payments. He urged qualitative improvements in NATO forces, including equipment standardization, and an increase in defense spending by NATO governments of up to five percent of their gross national product.\n\nSchlesinger had an abiding interest in strategic theory, but he also had to deal with a succession of immediate crises that tested his administrative and political skills. In October 1973, three months after he took office, Arab countries launched a surprise attack on Israel and started the Yom Kippur War. A few days after the war started, with Israel not faring as well as expected militarily, the Soviets resupplying some Arab countries and the Israeli government having authorized the use and assembly of nuclear weapons, the United States began an overt operation to airlift materiel to Israel. As Schlesinger explained, the initial U.S. policy to avoid direct involvement rested on the assumption that Israel would win quickly. But when it became clear that the Israelis faced more formidable military forces than anticipated, and could not meet their own resupply arrangements, the United States took up the burden. Schlesinger rejected charges that the Defense Department delayed the resupply effort to avoid irritating the Arab states and that he had had a serious disagreement over this matter with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Eventually the combatants agreed to a cease-fire, but not before the Soviet Union threatened to intervene on the Arab side and the United States declared a higher level worldwide alert of its forces.\n\nAnother crisis flared in July 1974 within the NATO alliance when Turkish forces, concerned about the long-term lack of safety for the minority Turkish community, invaded Cyprus after the Cypriot National Guard, supported by the government of Greece, overthrew President Archbishop Makarios. When the fighting stopped, the Turks held the northern portion of country and about 40 percent of the island. Turkey's military action caused controversy in the United States, because of protests and lobbying by supporters of the Greek Cypriot side and, officially, because Turkish forces used some U.S.-supplied military equipment intended solely for NATO purposes.\n\nHe felt the Turks had overstepped the bounds of legitimate NATO interests in Cyprus and suggested that the United States might have to reexamine its military aid program to Turkey. During this time, President Gerald R. Ford had succeeded Nixon after his resignation; eventually Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made it clear with two presidential vetoes that they favored continued military assistance to Turkey as a valued NATO ally, but Congress overrode both vetoes and in December 1974 prohibited such aid, which instituted an arms embargo that lasted five years.\n\nThe last phase of the Indochina conflict occurred during Schlesinger's tenure. Although all U.S. combat forces had left South Vietnam in the spring of 1973, the United States continued to maintain a military presence in other areas of Southeast Asia. Some senators criticized Schlesinger and questioned him sharply during his confirmation hearings in June 1973 after he stated that he would recommend resumption of U.S. bombing in North Vietnam and Laos if North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam. However, when the North Vietnamese did begin an offensive early in 1975, the United States could do little to help the South Vietnamese, who collapsed completely as the North Vietnamese entered Saigon in late April. Schlesinger announced early in the morning of 29 April 1975 the evacuation from Saigon by helicopter of the last U.S. diplomatic, military, and civilian personnel.\n\nOnly one other notable event remained in the Indochina drama. In May 1975 Khmer Rouge forces boarded and captured the crew of the \"Mayaguez\", an unarmed U.S.-registered freighter. The United States bombarded military and fuel installations on the Cambodian mainland while Marines landed by helicopter on an offshore island to rescue the crew. The 39 captives were retrieved, but the operation cost the lives of 41 U.S. military personnel. Nevertheless, the majority of the American people seemed to approve of the administration's decisive action.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given his determination to build up U.S. strategic and conventional forces, Schlesinger devoted much time and effort to the Defense budget. Even before becoming secretary, in a speech in San Francisco in September 1972, he warned that it was time \"to call a halt to the self-defeating game of cutting defense outlays, this process, that seems to have become addictive, of chopping away year after year.\" Shortly after he took office, he complained about \"the post-war follies\" of Defense budget-cutting. Later he outlined the facts about the DoD budget: In real terms it had been reduced by one-third since FY 1968; it was one-eighth below the pre-Vietnam War FY 1964 budget; purchases of equipment, consumables, and R&D were down 45 percent from the wartime peak and about $10 billion in constant dollars below the prewar level; Defense now absorbed about 6 percent of the gross national product, the lowest percentage since before the Korean War; military manpower was at the lowest point since before the Korean War; and Defense spending amounted to about 17 percent of total national expenditures, the lowest since before the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941. Armed with these statistics, and alarmed by continuing Soviet weapon advances, Schlesinger became a vigorous advocate of larger DoD budgets. But he had little success. For FY 1975, Congress provided TOA of $86.1 billion, compared with $81.6 billion in FY 1974; for FY 1976, the amount was $95.6 billion, an increase of 3.4 percent, but in real terms slightly less than it had been in FY 1955.\n\nSchlesinger's insistence on higher defense budgets, his disagreements within the administration and with Congress on this issue, and his differences with Secretary of State Kissinger all contributed to his dismissal from office by President Ford in November 1975. Schlesinger's legacy included the development of the close-air support aircraft the A-10, and the lightweight F-16 fighter. Kissinger strongly supported the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks process, while Schlesinger wanted assurances that arms control agreements would not put the United States in a strategic position inferior to the Soviet Union. The secretary's harsh criticism of some congressional leaders dismayed President Ford, who was more willing than Schlesinger to compromise on the Defense budget. On 2 November 1975, the president dismissed Schlesinger and made other important personnel changes. Kissinger lost his position as special assistant to the President for national security affairs but remained as secretary of state. Schlesinger left office on 19 November 1975, explaining his departure in terms of his budgetary differences with the White House.\n\nThe unreported, but important, main reason behind Schlesinger's dismissal, though, was his insubordination toward President Ford. During the \"Mayaguez\" incident, Ford ordered several retaliatory strikes against Cambodia. Schlesinger told Ford the first strike was carried out, but Ford later learned that Schlesinger, who disagreed with the order, had none of them carried out. According to Bob Woodward's 1999 book, \"Shadow\", Ford let the incident go, but when Schlesinger committed further insubordination on other matters, Ford finally fired him. Woodward observes, \"The United States had just lost a war for the first time. . . . That the president and the secretary of defense could not agree on who was in charge was appalling.. . . [This] unpublicized breakdown in the military chain of command was ... perhaps the most significant scandal of the Ford presidency.\" Schlesinger had also disobeyed Ford when told to send as many military aircraft as possible to evacuate South Vietnam. Schlesinger disagreed with doing so and didn't send the aircraft. Woodward says that an elected president, which Ford was not, would never have tolerated the insubordination.\n\nIn spite of the controversy surrounding both his tenure and dismissal, Schlesinger was by most accounts an able secretary of defense. A serious and perceptive thinker on nuclear strategy, he was determined that the United States not fall seriously behind the Soviet Union in conventional and nuclear forces and devoted himself to modernization of defense policies and programs. He got along well with the military leadership because he proposed to give them more resources, consulted with them regularly, and shared many of their views. Because he was a forthright speaker who could be blunt in his opinions and did not enjoy the personal rapport with legislators that prior Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird had, his relations with Congress were often strained. A majority of its members may have approved Schlesinger's strategic plans, but they kept a tight rein on the money for his programs. As for the Pentagon bureaucracy, Schlesinger generally left its management to Deputy Secretary of Defense William P. Clements. \n\nAfter leaving the Pentagon, Schlesinger wrote and spoke forcefully about national security issues, especially the Soviet threat and the need for the United States to maintain adequate defenses. When Jimmy Carter became President in January 1977 he appointed Schlesinger, a Republican, as his special adviser on energy and subsequently as the first Secretary of Energy in October 1977. According to one account, \"Schlesinger impressed candidate Jimmy Carter with his brains, his high-level experience... and with secrets regarding the defense spending vacillations of his old boss, Ford, just in time for the presidential debates.\"\n\nAs Energy Secretary, Schlesinger launched the Department's Carbon Dioxide Effects and Assessment Program shortly after the creation of that department in 1977. Secretary Schlesinger also oversaw the integration of the energy powers of more than 50 agencies, such as the Federal Energy Administration and the Federal Power Commission. In July 1979, Carter replaced him as part of a broader Cabinet shakeup. According to journalist Paul Glastris, \"Carter fired Schlesinger in 1979 in part for the same reason Gerald Ford had—he was unbearably arrogant and impatient with lesser minds who disagreed with him, and hence inept at dealing with Congress.\"\n\nAfter leaving the Energy Department, Schlesinger resumed his writing and speaking career, including the 1994 lecture at the Waldo Family Lecture on International Relations at Old Dominion University. He was employed as a senior adviser to Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc., of New York City. He advised Congressman and presidential candidate Richard Gephardt in 1988.\n\nIn 1995, he was the Chairman of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA). They wrote a report in conjunction with the National Research Council called \"The Global Positioning System: Charting the Future\" The report advocated for the opening GPS up to the private sector.\n\nOn February 8, 2002, he appeared at a hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee in support of the creation of a commission to investigate the 9/11 attacks.\n\nOn June 11, 2002 he was appointed by U.S. President George W. Bush to the Homeland Security Advisory Council. He also served as a consultant to the United States Department of Defense, and was a member of the Defense Policy Board.\n\nIn 2004, he served as chairman to the Independent Panel to Review DoD Detention Operations.\n\nOn January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the White House of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. On January 31, 2006 he was appointed by the Secretary of State to be a member of the Arms Control and Nonproliferation Advisory Board. On May 2, 2006, he was named to be a co-chairman of a Defense Science Board study on DOD Energy Strategy. He was an honorary chairman of The OSS Society. He was also a Bilderberg Group attendee in 2008.\n\nIn 2007, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin appointed Schlesinger to be the Chairman of the National Space-based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Advisory Board. The \"PNT Board\" is composed of recognized Global Positioning System (GPS) experts from outside the U.S. government that advise the Deputy Secretary level PNT Executive Committee in their oversight management of the GPS constellation and its governmental augmentations. \n\nOn June 5, 2008, Defense Secretary Robert Gates appointed Schlesinger to head a task force to ensure the \"highest levels\" of control over nuclear weapons. The purpose of the review was to prevent a repeat of recent incidents where control was lost over components of nuclear weapons, and even over nuclear weapons themselves. \n\nSchlesinger was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The MITRE Corporation, having served on it from 1985 until his death in 2014; on the advisory board of \"The National Interest\"; a Director of BNFL, Inc., Peabody Energy, Sandia Corporation, Seven Seas Petroleum Company, Chairman of the Executive Committee of The Nixon Center. He was also on the Advisory Board of GeoSynFuels, LLC. Schlesinger penned a number of opinion pieces on global warming, expressing a strongly skeptical position. \n\nSchlesinger raised awareness of the peak oil issue and supports facing it. In the keynote speech at a 2007 conference hosted by the Association for the Study of Peak Oil in Cork, Schlesinger said that oil industry executives now privately concede that the world faces an imminent oil production peak. In his 2010 ASPO-USA keynote speech, Schlesinger observed that the Peak Oil debate was over. He warned of political inaction as a major hindrance, like those in Pompeii before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.\n\nOn June 5, 2008, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that he had asked Schlesinger to lead a senior-level task force to recommend improvements in the stewardship and operation of nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and sensitive components by the US DoD following the 2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident. Members of the task force came from the Defense Policy Board and the Defense Science Board.\n\nIn 1954, Schlesinger married Rachel Line Mellinger (February 27, 1930 – October 11, 1995); they had eight children: Cora (1955), Charles (1956), Ann (1958), William (1959), Emily (1961), Thomas (1964), Clara (1966) and James (1970).\n\nThough raised in a Jewish household, Schlesinger converted to Lutheranism as an adult.\n\nRachel Schlesinger was an accomplished violinist and board member of the Arlington Symphony. In the early 1990s, she was a leader in the fundraising effort to create a premier performing arts center on the Virginia side of the Potomac River. She died from cancer before seeing the center's completion. After her death, Dr. Schlesinger donated $1 million to have the center named in his wife's memory. The Rachel M. Schlesinger Concert Hall and Arts Center at Northern Virginia Community College, Alexandria Campus opened in September, 2001. It is an up-to-date building that features the Mary Baker Collier Theatre, the Margaret W. and Joseph L. Fisher Art Gallery, the Wachovia Forum and Seminar Room spaces. Clients of the Schlesinger Center include the Alexandria Symphony, the United States Marine Band, \"The President's Own\", and the U.S. Marine Chamber Orchestra, the United States Army Band, \"Pershing's Own\", and the U.S. Army Strings, the United States Navy Band, the New Dominion Chorale, the American Balalaika Symphony, Festivals of Music, various ethnic groups and many others.\n\nSchlesinger worked consistently with distinction long after his government and academic experiences, serving on numerous governmental advisory boards until only weeks before his death at the age of 85.\nHe was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery in Springfield, Ohio.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7015523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7015523", "title": "Koiné language", "text": "Koiné language\n\nIn linguistics, a koiné language, koiné dialect, or simply koiné (Ancient Greek κοινή, \"common [language]\") is a standard language or dialect that has arisen as a result of contact between two or more mutually intelligible varieties (dialects) of the same language.\n\nSince speakers already understood one another from before the advent of the koiné, the \"koineization\" process is not as drastic as pidginization and creolization. Unlike pidginization and creolization, there is no \"target\" within Koine formation. It involves continuity in that speakers do not need to abandon their own linguistic varieties.\n\nNormal influence between neighbouring dialects is not regarded as koineization. A koiné variety emerges as a new spoken variety in addition to the originating dialects; it does not change any existing dialect. That separates koineization from normal evolution of dialects.\n\nThe term \"koine\" (meaning \"common\" in Greek) was first used to refer to the form of Greek used as a lingua franca during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. It arose as a mixed vernacular among ordinary people in the Peiraieus, the seaport of Athens, which was inhabited by Greeks from different parts of the Mediterranean.\n\nThrough koineization, new dialect varieties are brought about as a result of contact between speakers of mutually intelligible varieties of that language. Koineization is a particular case of dialect contact and how it typically occurs in new settlements to which people have migrated from different parts of a single language area. Koineization typically takes two or three generations to complete, though it can be achievable within the first generation.\n\nLanguage variation is systematic, in that it can be related to social divisions within a community, such as class and gender. Change can be shown to originate with particular social groups based on these divisions. However, a number of linguists have recently argued that language change lies with the individual.\n\nLinguist Paul Kerswill identifies two types of koinés: regional and immigrant:\n\n\nKerswill also examines the Norwegian dialects that emerged in two towns which were located around smelters built at the head of the Sørfjord branch of the Hardangerfjord in the mid-twentieth century. The towns, Odda and Tyssedal, both drew migrants from different parts of Norway. The workers in Odda came predominantly (86%) from western Norway. In Tyssedal only about one-third came from western Norway; a third came from eastern Norway; and the rest from other parts of the country. The dialects that evolved in these two towns were thus very different from each other.\n\nPeter Trudgill sees three processes in operation during what Mesthrie calls the accommodation period: mixing, levelling and simplification. The processes of leveling and simplification are both dependent on a wide range of factors, including the differential prestige related of the contributing dialects, socio-political contexts in which the new dialect develops, and individual networks of adults involved in the accommodation process. Additionally, both Trudgill and Mesthrie also comment on the process of reallocation, in which features that have been retained from contributing dialects take on new meanings or functions within the new dialect.\n\nTrudgill posits a multi-generational model of the development of a koiné. During the first (i.e., immigrant) generation, the speakers of the contributing dialects mix, and there is some leveling. The first native-born generation of speakers continues the leveling process. However, in the instances Trudgill was able to document (e.g., first generation speakers of Tyssedal and Odda dialects of Norwegian), the speech of this generation still reflected considerable variability in use of marked forms, both between speakers and in the repertoire of individual speakers.\n\nIt is the third generation that focuses the variations and stabilizes the dialect. Trudgill admits that there are cases where the focusing can take place in the first generation of native-born speakers and also instances where it might be in the fourth or even later generations. The dialect in its emerging state, a state marked by heterogeneity of forms, Trudgill calls \"interdialect\", often called an interlanguage in other dialect studies.\n\nDialects:\n\n\nLanguages:\n\n\n\n"}

Proposed amendments included Articles 4, 18, 21, 101 and 104 of the Constitution of Latvia by adding the condition about Russian as the second official language, as well as prescribing two working languages — Latvian and Russian — for self-government institutions. The referendum's question was \"Do you support the adoption of the Draft Law \"Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia\" that provides for the Russian language the status of the second official language?\".\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, Russian was the native language of 37.5% and the second language of 43.7% of the residents. Since 2000, Russian has been regarded as a foreign language according to the Official Language Law.\n\nIn 2010, the National Alliance started to collect signatures to force a referendum on whether all publicly financed schools would have to use Latvian exclusively. By 9 June 2011, they had gathered 120,433 signatures of the minimum 153,232 signatures required, failing to force a referendum.\n\nProtesting against the National Alliance initiative, on 15 February 2011, the youth movement \"United Latvia\" (), led by Eduard Svatkov, announced the idea of making Russian an official language, alongside Latvian. On 4 March 2011, \"United Latvia\", together with the newly created organisation \"Mother Tongue\" (), led by activist Vladimir Linderman (former leader of the Latvian branch of the Russian National Bolshevik Party), Yevgeny Osipov (leader of \"Osipov Party\"), and Aleksandr Gaponenko (director of the Institute of European Studies, economist), started to collect signatures for a referendum petition. They gathered 187,378 signatures, forcing a referendum.\n\nThe referendum initiators mentioned possible assimilation of minority children as the main reason to protest. One of the goals of this protest action was to slow down the ongoing process of National Alliance signature collecting. Those initiating the referendum to make Russian co-official argued: \"In such case there is no other defense method than attack. The initiator of hysteria should be shaken strongly to stop hysteria.\"\n\nThe referendum was held after the Saeima rejected the draft law \"Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia\" supported by more than one-tenth of the voters during the Collection of signatures. At least half of the entire electorate has to vote Yes in the referendum in order for it to be valid (771,893).\n\nLegal scholars stated that beside statehood elements, the initiative would have influenced multiple basic human rights and general principles of law protected by the Constitution of Latvia, such as the right to preserve and develop the Latvian language and Latvian ethnic and cultural identity, to participate in the work of the state and of local government, and to hold a position in the civil service; the right to choose one’s employment and workplace freely; the right to education; the rights of a child; and the right to equality and non-discrimination, principles of proportionality, legal certainty, and legitimate expectations.\n\nThe referendum organisers did not deny that the main achievement would be to show a large number of Russian language supporters and the final goal would be to change the status of Russian from foreign to some legal (i.e. regional) in the future. Official status for Russian was requested due to the fact that the Constitution and Official Language Law do not have any other definitions for language status other than making a language official. Amendments for granting any other status for Russian (i.e. regional) would have had a higher risk of rejection by the Constitutional Court, thus cancelling the referendum.\n\nOrganization for Security and Co-operation in Europe High Commissioner on National Minorities Knut Vollebæk planned to visit Latvia after the referendum.\n\nA total of 85 polling stations in 41 countries — the greatest number ever — have been open outside Latvia. Besides the stations in all Embassies and many Consulates General and Honorary Consulates of Latvia, polling stations were operating in the Latvian Houses in Australia, in the Daugavas Vanagi House in London, and in the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Churches in the United States. New polling stations were operating in Austria, Chile, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland, Venezuela, and in the British cities of Boston and Manchester, as well as the island of Guernsey.\n\nMayor of Riga Nils Ušakovs, an ethnic Russian, initially refrained from supporting the referendum, but later called for a \"yes\" vote. President Andris Bērziņš initially stated he would abstain before calling for a \"no\" vote. Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis also called for a \"no\".\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Baltic Institute of Social Sciences in 2004, 51% of respondents supported or rather supported official status for Russian, 44% opposed or rather opposed it. The focus group for this research was all the inhabitants of Latvia, including Latvian non-citizens.\n\nAccording to a poll performed by TNS Latvia in January 2012, 59% of citizens would vote 'no', 25% 'yes', 10% would abstain, and 6% had no opinion on the issue.\nAccording to a poll performed by Latvijas fakti in January 2012, 62.4% of citizens would vote 'no', 28% 'yes', 12.8% would abstain, and 7% had no opinion on the issue.\n\nAround three-quarters of voters voted against Russian as a second national language, with only the eastern region of Latgale seeing a majority of citizens voting for the change. The referendum had considerably higher voter participation than in previous elections and referendums, with more than 71.1% of registered voters casting ballots.\n\nA large part of the Russian speaking community in Latvia (290,660 or 14.1% of Latvia's entire population) could not vote in this referendum because, since 1991, they have held non-citizen status and thus have no right to vote. However, the above numbers also show that non-citizens could not have changed the result of the referendum if they had been allowed to vote. If all 290,660 members of the Russian community had participated and voted in favor of the motion, the proposal would still have been rejected with 59.15% against and 40.60% in favor, with turnout increasing to 75.68% from 71.11%.\n\nAnalysts say the turnout, at nearly 70 percent, indicates the strength of feeling among many ordinary Latvians, who are keen to distance themselves culturally from their former Soviet rulers. The referendum can widen the schism in society and the government will have to undertake serious efforts to consolidate the country's two groups. Though the Russians who spearheaded the referendum admitted they had no chance at winning the plebiscite, they at least hope the approximate 25 percent of support will force Latvia's center-right government to begin a dialogue with national minorities. Many fear the disgruntled minority will keep up the pressure by calling for more referendums to change Latvia's constitution for minorities' benefit.\n\n"}

At the same time single voiced consonants (, , , etc.) are not devoiced word-finally: , .\n\nDoubled consonants are pronounced longer: . The same occurs with plosives and fricatives located between two short vowels, as in , and with that is pronounced as , and and as .\n\nA palatalized dental trill is still used in some dialects (mainly outside Latvia) but quite rarely, and hence the corresponding letter was removed from the alphabet.\n\nLatvian has six vowels, with length as distinctive feature:\n\n, and the diphthongs involving it other than , are confined to loanwords.\n\nThe vowel length ratio is about 1:2.5. Vowel length is phonemic and plays an important role in the language. For example, means 'made of wood', means 'on the tree'; means 'a drop', and means 'a duck'.\n\nLatvian also has 10 diphthongs (), although some diphthongs are mostly limited to proper names and interjections.\n\nStandard Latvian and, with a few minor exceptions, all of the Latvian dialects, have fixed initial stress. Long vowels and diphthongs have a tone, regardless of their position in the word. This includes the so-called \"mixed diphthongs\", composed of a short vowel followed by a sonorant. There are three types of tones:\n\nBesides the three-tone system of the standard variety, there are also Latvian dialects with only two tones: in western parts of Latvia, the falling tone has merged with the broken tone, while in eastern parts of Latvia the level tone has merged with the falling tone. Hence, the Central Latvian , , correspond to Western Latvian , , , and to Eastern Latvian , , .\n\nThis system is phonetically more or less similar to the ones found in Lithuanian, Swedish, Norwegian and Serbo-Croatian. The broken tone has some similarity to the Danish stød.\n\nOverall, Latvian phonology is not too dissimilar from Italian, in contrast to the more Greek-like sound of Lithuanian.\n\nLatvian roots may alternate between and depending on whether the following segment is a vowel or a consonant. For example, the root ('Daugava River') in the nominative case is , but is pronounced in the city name . In this example, the vocalic alternant is realized as the off-glide of the diphthong . However, when following a vowel that does not form an attested Latvian diphthong (for example, ), is pronounced as a monophthong, as in ('fish-'; cf. 'fish-').\n\n"}

{"id": "20034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20034", "title": "Mutual recursion", "text": "Mutual recursion\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, mutual recursion is a form of recursion where two mathematical or computational objects, such as functions or data types, are defined in terms of each other. Mutual recursion is very common in functional programming and in some problem domains, such as recursive descent parsers, where the data types are naturally mutually recursive.\n\nThe most important basic example of a data type that can be defined by mutual recursion is a tree, which can be defined mutually recursively in terms of a forest (a list of trees). Symbolically:\nA forest \"f\" consists of a list of trees, while a tree \"t\" consists of a pair of a value \"v\" and a forest \"f\" (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one thing with the value, and another thing with the children.\n\nThis mutually recursive definition can be converted to a singly recursive definition by inlining the definition of a forest:\nA tree \"t\" consists of a pair of a value \"v\" and a list of trees (its children). This definition is more compact, but somewhat messier: a tree consists of a pair of one type and a list of another, which require disentangling to prove results about.\n\nIn Standard ML, the tree and forest data types can be mutually recursively defined as follows, allowing empty trees:\nJust as algorithms on recursive data types can naturally be given by recursive functions, algorithms on mutually recursive data structures can be naturally given by mutually recursive functions. Common examples include algorithms on trees, and recursive descent parsers. As with direct recursion, tail call optimization is necessary if the recursion depth is large or unbounded, such as using mutual recursion for multitasking. Note that tail call optimization in general (when the function called is not the same as the original function, as in tail-recursive calls) may be more difficult to implement than the special case of tail-recursive call optimization, and thus efficient implementation of mutual tail recursion may be absent from languages that only optimize tail-recursive calls. In languages such as Pascal that require declaration before use, mutually recursive functions require forward declaration, as a forward reference cannot be avoided when defining them.\n\nAs with directly recursive functions, a wrapper function may be useful, with the mutually recursive functions defined as nested functions within its scope if this is supported. This is particularly useful for sharing state across a set of functions without having to pass parameters between them.\n\nA standard example of mutual recursion, which is admittedly artificial, determines whether a non-negative number is even or odd by defining two separate functions that call each other, decrementing each time. In C:\nThese functions are based on the observation that the question \"is 4 even?\" is equivalent to \"is 3 odd?\", which is in turn equivalent to \"is 2 even?\", and so on down to 0. This example is mutual single recursion, and could easily be replaced by iteration. In this example, the mutually recursive calls are tail calls, and tail call optimization would be necessary to execute in constant stack space. In C, this would take \"O\"(\"n\") stack space, unless rewritten to use jumps instead of calls.\n\nAs a more general class of examples, an algorithm on a tree can be decomposed into its behavior on a value and its behavior on children, and can be split up into two mutually recursive functions, one specifying the behavior on a tree, calling the forest function for the forest of children, and one specifying the behavior on a forest, calling the tree function for the tree in the forest. In Python:\n\nIn this case the tree function calls the forest function by single recursion, but the forest function calls the tree function by multiple recursion.\n\nUsing the Standard ML data type above, the size of a tree (number of nodes) can be computed via the following mutually recursive functions:\nA more detailed example in Scheme, counting the leaves of a tree:\nThese examples reduce easily to a single recursive function by inlining the forest function in the tree function, which is commonly done in practice: directly recursive functions that operate on trees sequentially process the value of the node and recurse on the children within one function, rather than dividing these into two separate functions.\n\nA more complicated example is given by recursive descent parsers, which can be naturally implemented by having one function for each production rule of a grammar, which then mutually recurse; this will in general be multiple recursion, as production rules generally combine multiple parts. This can also be done without mutual recursion, for example by still having separate functions for each production rule, but having them called by a single controller function, or by putting all the grammar in a single function.\n\nMutual recursion can also implement a finite-state machine, with one function for each state, and single recursion in changing state; this requires tail call optimization if the number of state changes is large or unbounded. This can be used as a simple form of cooperative multitasking. A similar approach to multitasking is to instead use coroutines which call each other, where rather than terminating by calling another routine, one coroutine yields to another but does not terminate, and then resumes execution when it is yielded back to. This allows individual coroutines to hold state, without it needing to be passed by parameters or stored in shared variables.\n\nThere are also some algorithms which naturally have two phases, such as minimax (min and max), and these can be implemented by having each phase in a separate function with mutual recursion, though they can also be combined into a single function with direct recursion.\n\nIn mathematics, the Hofstadter Female and Male sequences are an example of a pair of integer sequences defined in a mutually recursive manner.\n\nFractals can be computed (up to a given resolution) by recursive functions. This can sometimes be done more elegantly via mutually recursive functions; the Sierpiński curve is a good example.\n\nMutual recursion is very common in the functional programming style, and is often used for programs written in LISP, Scheme, ML, and similar languages. In languages such as Prolog, mutual recursion is almost unavoidable.\n\nSome programming styles discourage mutual recursion, claiming that it can be confusing to distinguish the conditions which will return an answer from the conditions that would allow the code to run forever without producing an answer. Peter Norvig points to a design pattern which discourages the use entirely, stating:\nMutual recursion is also known as indirect recursion, by contrast with direct recursion, where a single function calls itself directly. This is simply a difference of emphasis, not a different notion: \"indirect recursion\" emphasises an individual function, while \"mutual recursion\" emphasises the set of functions, and does not single out an individual function. For example, if \"f\" calls itself, that is direct recursion. If instead \"f\" calls \"g\" and then \"g\" calls \"f,\" which in turn calls \"g\" again, from the point of view of \"f\" alone, \"f\" is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of \"g\" alone, \"g\" is indirectly recursing, while from the point of view of both, \"f\" and \"g\" are mutually recursing on each other. Similarly a set of three or more functions that call each other can be called a set of mutually recursive functions.\n\nMathematically, a set of mutually recursive functions are primitive recursive, which can be proven by course-of-values recursion, building a single function \"F\" that lists the values of the individual recursive function in order: formula_1 and rewriting the mutual recursion as a primitive recursion.\n\nAny mutual recursion between two procedures can be converted to direct recursion by inlining the code of one procedure into the other. If there is only one site where one procedure calls the other, this is straightforward, though if there are several it can involve code duplication. In terms of the call stack, two mutually recursive procedures yield a stack ABABAB..., and inlining B into A yields the direct recursion (AB)(AB)(AB)...\n\nAlternately, any number of procedures can be merged into a single procedure that takes as argument a variant record (or algebraic data type) representing the selection of a procedure and its arguments; the merged procedure then dispatches on its argument to execute the corresponding code and uses direct recursion to call self as appropriate. This can be seen as a limited application of defunctionalization. This translation may be useful when any of the mutually recursive procedures can be called by outside code, so there is no obvious case for inlining one procedure into the other. Such code then needs to be modified so that procedure calls are performed by bundling arguments into a variant record as described; alternately, wrapper procedures may be used for this task.\n\n\n\n"}

Scholars differ as to whether they regard Oirat as a distinct language or a major dialect of the Mongolian language. Oirat speaking areas are scattered across the far west of the Mongolian state, the northwest of People's Republic of China (mainly in Xinjiang, but even \"Deed Mongol\" in Qinghai and, with a tiny population, in Gansu), and Russia's Caspian coast, where its major variety is Kalmyk. In all three countries, Oirat has become variously endangered or even obsolescent as a direct result of government actions or as a consequence of social and economic policies. Its most widespread tribal dialect, which is spoken in all of these nations, is Torgut. The term \"Oirat\" or, more precisely, Written Oirat is sometimes also used to refer to the language of historical documents written in the Clear script.\n\nIn Mongolia, there are seven historical Oirat dialects, each corresponding to a different tribe:\n\nThere are some varieties that are difficult to classify. The Alasha dialect in Alxa League in Inner Mongolia originally belonged to Oirat and has been classified as such by some because of its phonology. But it has been classified by others as Mongolian proper because of its morphology. The Darkhad dialect in Mongolia's Khövsgöl Province has variously been classified as Oirat, Mongolian proper, or (less often) Buryat.\n\nOirat is endangered in all areas where it is spoken. In Russia, the killing of a large fraction of the Kalmyk population and the destruction of their society as consequences of the Kalmyk deportations of 1943, along with the subsequent imposition among them of Russian as the sole official language have rendered the language obsolescent: it is almost exclusively the elderly who have a fluent command of Kalmyk. In China, while Oirat is still quite widely used in its traditional ranges and there are many monolingual speakers, a combination of government policies and social realities has created an environment deleterious to the use of this language: the Chinese authorities' adoption of Southern Mongolian as the normative Mongolian language, new educational policies which have led to the virtual elimination of Mongolian schools in Xinjiang (there were just two left as of 2009), policies aiming to curtail nomadism, and the limited occupational prospects in Chinese society for graduates of Mongolian schools. As for Mongolia, the predominance of Khalkha Mongolian is bringing about the Khalkhaization of all other varieties of Mongolian.\n\nOirat has been written in two script systems: historically, the Clear script, which originated from the Mongolian script, was used. It uses modified letters shapes e.g. to differentiate between different rounded vowels, and it uses a small stroke on the right to indicate vowel length. It was retained longest in China where it can still be found in an occasional journal article. In Kalmykia, a Cyrillic-based script system has been implemented. It is strictly phonemic, not representing epenthetic vowels, and thus doesn’t show syllabification. In Mongolia, Central Mongolian minority varieties have no status, thus Oirats are supposed to use Mongolian Cyrillic which de facto only represents Khalkha Mongolian. In China, Buryat and Oirat are considered non-standard as compared to Southern Mongolian and are therefore supposed to use the Mongolian script and Southern Mongolian grammar (if not, as in current practice, rather Mandarin Chinese and hànzì) for writing.\n\n"}

{"id": "30331208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30331208", "title": "Postponement of affect", "text": "Postponement of affect\n\nPostponement of affect is a defence mechanism which may be used against a variety of feelings or emotions. Such a 'temporal displacement, resulting simply in a later appearance of the affect reaction and in thus preventing the recognition of the motivating connection, is most frequently used against the affects of rage (or annoyance) and grief'.\n\nIn the affect of grief, postponement seems to be an essential component. What happens in mourning is nothing other than a gradual \"working-through\" of an affect which, if released in its full strength, would overwhelm the ego'. John Bowlby considered the first of the \"four phases of mourning\" to be a 'Phase of numbness that...may be interrupted by outbursts of extremely intense distress and/or anger'. Thus one can speak of 'a rather typical postponement of grief': '\"I feel hurt about something and then automatically this kind of shields things up and then I feel like I can't really touch or feel anything very much\"...\"postponement\"...[of] the weepiness'.\n\nConversely, Eric Lindemann, describing 'the symptomatology and management of acute grief following the Coconut Grove night-club fire...showed that people who do not \"break down\" and express feelings appropriate to a bereavement may suffer from delayed or distorted grief'.\n\nInvestigation of 'the reaction of the ego to acute mortal danger...repeatedly found an absence of fear during the period of acute danger, but a subsequent appearance of acute fear when the danger was past'. This may be a contributing factor in post-traumatic stress disorder, where the sufferer may be 'the victim...of a blocked fear tension...he hadn't had the time to feel the fear'.\n\n'The postponement of fright is so well known to movie writers that it is not only frequently used but also designated by a special term: double-take'.\n\nDefence against guilt feelings may involve people using postponement by way of 'an \"isolation\" of guilt feeling...they do things without any guilt feeling, and experience an exaggerated feeling of guilt on some other occasion without being aware of the connection'. Such postponement can be linked to Nietzsche's concept of the \"pale criminal\" or 'neurotic immoralist...the \"pale felon\" who does not live up to his acts' – retrospective guilt: 'he was equal to his deed when he did it; but he could not bear its image after it was done...now the lead of his guilt lies upon him'.\n\nA similar postponement of guilt may be seen in everyday life, as when 'a woman may decide that her Superego will permit her to cheat on her spouse...[but] may begin to feel guilty many years afterwards..\n\nIn pathological form something similar would seem to occur 'during a melancholic attack', or so Freud surmised: the 'super-ego becomes over-severe, abuses the poor ego...reproaches it for actions in the remotest past which had been taken lightly at the time – as though it had spent the whole interval in collecting accusations and had only been waiting for its current access of strength in order to bring them up'.\n\nConversely, 'people who can muster the courage to face up to their guilt...will not suffer as long from the agony of the cognitive rehearsal of the guilt situation as people who postpone facing up to their guilt'.\n\nFreud saw the development of the reality principle as a process which 'demands and carries into effect the postponement of satisfaction...and the temporary toleration of unpleasure as a step on the long indirect road to pleasure'. Such impulse control has been seen as a key component in emotional intelligence. 'The ability to delay gratification contributes powerfully to intellectual potential quite apart from IQ itself', while what has been called '\"goal-directed self-imposed delay of gratification\" is perhaps the essence of emotional self-regulation: the ability to deny impulse in the service of a goal'.\n\nSimilarly, among the defence mechanisms, as part of 'the \"mature\" ways of dealing with real stress...there's \"suppression\" – instead of repressing a frightening feeling and pushing it right out of awareness, you hold it in check and bear the discomfort of \"feeling\" it. That means you are more likely to be able to work out how to handle it, given a bit of time'. In this sense, 'delaying, as opposed to avoidance, is a fine mechanism, another form of the method of learning I call step-by-step'.\n\n"}
{"id": "30692239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30692239", "title": "Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages", "text": "Schwa deletion in Indo-Aryan languages\n\nSchwa deletion, or schwa syncope, is a phenomenon that sometimes occurs in Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Gujarati, Maithili and several other Indo-Aryan languages with schwas that are implicit in their written scripts. Languages like Marathi with increased influence of other languages through coming into contact with them also shows similar phenomenon. Some schwas are obligatorily deleted in pronunciation even if the script suggests otherwise.\n\nSchwa deletion is important for intelligibility and unaccented speech. It also presents a challenge to non-native speakers and speech synthesis software because the scripts, including Devanagari, do not tell when schwas should be deleted.\n\nFor example, the Sanskrit word \"Rāma\" (, राम) is pronounced \"Rām\" (, राम्) in Hindi. The schwa (ə) sound at the end of the word is deleted in Hindi. However, in both cases, the word is written राम.\n\nThe schwa is not deleted in ancient languages such as Sanskrit or Pali.\n\nAlthough the Devanagari script is used as a standard to write Modern Hindi, the schwa ('ə') implicit in each consonant of the script is \"obligatorily deleted\" at the end of words and in certain other contexts, unlike in Sanskrit. That phenomenon has been termed the \"\"schwa syncope rule\" or the \"schwa deletion rule\"\" of Hindi. One formalisation of this rule has been summarised as \"ə → ∅ /VC_CV\". In other words, when a schwa-succeeded consonant is followed by a vowel-succeeded consonant, the schwa inherent in the first consonant is deleted. However, that rules sometimes deletes a schwa that should remain and sometimes fails to delete a schwa when it should be deleted. The rule is reported to result in correct predictions on schwa deletion 89% of the time.\n\nSchwa deletion is computationally important because it is essential to building text-to-speech software for Hindi.\n\nAs a result of schwa syncope, the Hindi pronunciation of many words differs from that expected from a literal Sanskrit-style reading of Devanagari. For instance, राम is pronounced \"Rām\" (not \"Rāma\", as in Sanskrit), रचना is pronounced \"Rachnā\" (not \"Rachanā\"), वेद is pronounced \"Véd\" (not \"Véda\") and नमकीन is pronounced \"Namkeen\" (not \"Namakeena\"). The name of the script itself is pronounced \"Devnāgrī\", not \"Devanāgarī\".\n\nCorrect schwa deletion is also critical because the same letter sequence is pronounced two different ways in Hindi depending on the context. Failure to delete the appropriate schwas can then change the meaning. For instance, the letter sequence 'रक' is pronounced differently in हरकत (\"har.kat\", meaning \"movement\" or \"activity\") and सरकना (\"sarak.na\", meaning \"to slide\"). Similarly, the sequence धड़कने in दिल धड़कने लगा (\"the heart started beating\") and in दिल की धड़कनें (\"beats of the heart\") is identical prior to the nasalisation in the second usage. However, it is pronounced \"dhaṛak.ne\" in the first and \"dhaṛ.kaneṁ\" in the second.\n\nWhile native speakers pronounce the sequences differently in different contexts, non-native speakers and voice-synthesis software can make them \"sound very unnatural\", making it \"extremely difficult for the listener\" to grasp the intended meaning.\n\nDifferent Indo-Aryan languages can differ in how they apply schwa deletion. For instance, medial schwas from Sanskrit-origin words are often retained in Bengali even if they are deleted in Hindi. An example of this is रचना/রচনা which is pronounced \"racanā\" (/rətʃənaː/) in Sanskrit, \"racnā\" (/rətʃnaː/) in Hindi and \"rôcona\" (/rɔtʃona/) in Bengali. While the medial schwa is deleted in Hindi (because of the ə → ∅ / VC_CV rule), it is retained in Bengali.\n\nOn the other hand, the final schwa in वेद /বেদ is deleted in both Hindi and Bengali (Sanskrit: /veːd̪ə/, Hindi: /veːd̪/, Bengali: /bed̪/).\n\nBengali deleted schwas at the end but retained the medial schwas. In some cases the ending schwas are pronounced as in 'বঙ্গ' pronounced as 'Bongo' with 'o' standing for the vowel 'অ'. Another example is 'অরবিন্দ' pronounced as 'Aurobindo' is the name of the Bengali philosopher Sri Aurobindo.\n\nGujarati has a strong schwa deletion phenomenon, affecting both medial and final schwas. From an evolutionary perspective, the final schwas appear to have been lost prior to the medial ones.\n\nIn the Dardic subbranch of Indo-Aryan, Kashmiri similarly demonstrates schwa deletion. For instance, \"drākṣa\" (द्राक्ष) is the Sanskrit word for grape, but the final schwa is dropped in the Kashmiri version, which is \"dach\" (दछ् or دَچھ).\n\nMaithili's schwa deletion is similar to Hindustani, and ə → ∅ / VC_CV also selectively applies to the language. For instance, हमरो is \"həməro\" (\"even ours\") with schwas but is pronounced \"həmro\". That is akin to the neighbouring Bhojpuri in which हमरा (meaning \"mine\") is pronounced \"həmrā\" rather than \"həmərā\" from the deletion of a medial schwa.\n\nIn Marathi, the schwa at the end of the Sanskrit stems is retained in such cases as a few tatsama words. \nThe medial schwa is retained in most of the words. Marathi with increased influence of other languages through coming into contact with them has been showing the phenomenon of schwa deletion sometimes with words that traditionally pronounce schwas like रंग (ranga/colour), बंद (banda/close), गुण (guna/quality), गोड (goda/sweet), मार्ग (mārga/way or street), etc.\n\nIts Sanskrit tradition makes schwas be rarely deleted in Nepali except for in Hindi or Urdu loanwords. Thus, conjunctions and ligatures are used more extensively than in many other Indo-Aryan languages. For example, the word लाग्छ (Lagchha) contains a ligature between ग and छ and is pronounced with the schwa at the end. \n\nDue to retention of longer forms (-ng; ङ्) from Sanskrit, Nepali words like Ranga (रङ्ग), Anga (अङ्ग), Bhanga (भङ्ग), etc. have schwa pronounced at the end. Similarly, medial schwas are pronounced more in Nepali. For e.g; the surname \"Panta (पन्त)\" is pronounced with schwa in Nepali as compared to Hindi \"Pant (पंत)\" having Chandrabindu. Lesser usage of Chandrabindu has protected the schwa pronunciation in Nepali.\n\nOdia, declared the sixth classical language of India, retains the schwa in its pronunciation. Both medial and final schwas are retained, unlike Bengali, where only the medial schwas are retained.\n\nPunjabi has broad schwa deletion rules: several base word forms (ਕਾਗ਼ਜ਼, کاغز, \"kāghəz\"/\"paper\") drop schwas in the plural form (ਕਾਗ਼ਜ਼ਾਂ, کاغزاں, \"kāghzāṅ\"/\"papers\") as well as with instrumental (ਕਾਗ਼ਜ਼ੋਂ, کاغزوں, \"kāghzōṅ\"/\"from the paper\") and locative (ਕਾਗ਼ਜ਼ੇ, کاغزے, \"kāghzé\"/\"on the paper\") suffixes.\n\nSince Devanagari does not provide indications of where schwas should be deleted, it is common for non-native learners/speakers of Hindi, who are otherwise familiar with Devanagari and Sanskrit, to make incorrect pronunciations of words in Hindustani and other modern Indo-Aryan languages. Similarly, systems that automate transliteration from Devanagari to Latin script by hardcoding implicit schwas in every consonant often indicate the written form rather than the pronunciation. That becomes evident when English words are transliterated into Devanagari by Hindi-speakers and then transliterated back into English by manual or automated processes that do not account for Hindi's schwa deletion rules. For instance, the word \"English\" may be written by Hindi speakers as इंगलिश (rather than इंग्लिश्) which may be transliterated back to \"Ingalisha\" by automated systems, but schwa deletion would result in इंगलिश being correctly pronounced as \"Inglish\" by native Hindi-speakers.\n\nSome examples are shown below:\n\nWith some words that contain /n/ or /m/ consonants separated from succeeding consonants by schwas, the schwa deletion process has the effect of nasalising any preceding vowels. Here are some examples in Hindustani:\n\n"}

It is spoken by a small native population inhabiting the coastal towns and the mountains and wilderness areas upland from Salalah, located in the Dhofar Governorate in southwestern Oman.\n\nShehri (Jibbali, Geblet, Sheret, Šehri, Šhauri, Shahari, Jibali, Ehkili, Qarawi, and Garawi) is spoken along a dialect continuum that includes Western Jibbali, Central Jibbali, and Eastern Jibbali. The dialect used by the few inhabitants of Al-Hallaniyah in the Khuriya Muriya Islands is sometimes known as 'Baby' Jibbali. Speakers generally live a semi-nomadic culture, rearing cows and camels in the mountains. The dialects themselves contain only minor variances and are highly intelligible.\n\nLike most Modern South Arabian dialect speakers in Oman and Yemen, many Shehri speakers are bilingual in local dialects of Arabic especially the Dhofari dialect. In addition, it is primarily a spoken language, and there is no tradition of writing or publishing in the language. Pressure from Arabic has forced many changes in the language, so much so that young speakers use noticeably different grammar.\n\nThe vowel system is made up of an 8-member set, containing the normal Semitic \"i-u-a\", along with tense and lax vowels, and a central vowel. The vowel set is: \"i, e, Ó, Í, a, Ã, o, u.\" The difference between the long and short vowels is not always just phonological.\n\nNoun markers are a combination of Arabic, Ethiopian, and unique Modern South Arabian grammar markers. Nouns have an either masculine or feminine gender. Feminine markers use the endings of \"–(V)t\" or \"–h\", as in Arabic. Unlike Arabic, the dual number marker is not used in nouns, and is instead replaced by a suffix of the numeral 2 itself. Dual pronouns are no longer used by the youth, replaced by plural pronouns.\n\nSimple verb conjugations have two separate classes, with differing conjugations for perfect, imperfect, and subjunctive cases. Verbal clauses always take the order of VSO (Verb–subject–object) or SVO (Subject–verb–object). If the subject is an independent pronoun, it is placed before the verb. Guttural verbs have their own pattern. Verb classifications are intensive-conative, causative, reflexive (with infixed \"-t-\"), and causative-reflexive. In future verbs, a preverb \"ha-/h-\" precedes the subjunctive.\n\nThe numbers 1 and 2 act as adjectives. Between 3 and 10, masculine numbers enumerate feminine nouns, and feminine numbers enumerate masculine nouns. There is gender agreement between the number and nouns from 11 to 19. Beyond that, the structure is tens, “and”, and the unit. This is similar to Arabic counting. Livestock counting presents a special case that deviates from Arabic, instead using an ancient Bedouin system. Beyond 13, the noun used is either plural or singular.\n\n\n"}

As such it is a type of electronic lip reading. It works by the computer identifying the phonemes that an individual pronounces from nonauditory sources of information about their speech movements. These are then used to recreate the speech using speech synthesis.\n\nSilent speech interface systems have been created using ultrasound and optical camera input of tongue and lip movements. Electromagnetic devices are another technique for tracking tongue and lip movements. The detection of speech movements by electromyography of speech articulator\nmuscles and the larynx is another technique. Another source of information is the vocal tract resonance signals that get transmitted through bone conduction called non-audible murmurs. \nThey have also been created as a brain–computer interface using brain activity in the motor cortex obtained from intracortical microelectrodes.\n\nSuch devices are created as aids to those unable to create the sound phonation needed for audible speech such as after laryngectomies. Another use is for communication when speech is masked by background noise or distorted by self-contained breathing apparatus. A further practical use is where a need exists for silent communication, such as when privacy is required in a public place, or hands-free data silent transmission is needed during a military or security operation.\n\nIn 2002, the Japanese company NTT DoCoMo announced it had created a silent mobile phone using electromyography and imaging of lip movement. \"The spur to developing such a phone,\" the company said, \"was ridding public places of noise,\" adding that, \"the technology is also expected to help people who have permanently lost their voice.\" The feasibility of using silent speech interfaces for practical communication has since then been shown.\n\nThe decoding of silent speech using a computer played an important role in Arthur C.

In this, HAL 9000, a computer controlling spaceship Discovery One, bound for Jupiter, discovers a plot to deactivate it by the mission astronauts Dave Bowman and Frank Poole through lip reading their conversations.\n\nIn Orson Scott Card’s series (including \"Ender’s Game\"), the artificial intelligence can be spoken to while the protagonist wears a movement sensor in his jaw, enabling him to converse with the AI without making noise. He also wears an ear implant.\n\n"}

However, research has established from its lexicon that Sranan Tongo is mostly an English-based creole language, with a substantial overlay of words from Dutch because of the Dutch takeover of Suriname in 1667.\n\nSranan Tongo's lexicon is thus a fusion of mostly English and Dutch (+/-85%) and some Portuguese, and West African languages. It began as a pidgin spoken primarily by African slaves in Suriname who often did not have a common African language. Sranan Tongo also became the language of communication between the slaves and the slaveowners, as the slaves were not permitted to learn or speak Dutch. As other ethnic groups were brought to Suriname as contract workers, Sranan Tongo became a \"lingua franca\".\n\nAlthough the formal Dutch-based educational system repressed Sranan Tongo, it gradually became more accepted by the establishment, especially during the 1980s when it was popularized by the dictator Dési Bouterse, who often delivered national speeches in Sranan Tongo.\n\nSranan Tongo remains widely used in Suriname and in large Dutch urban areas populated by immigrants from Suriname, especially in casual conversation, which often freely mixes it with Dutch. Written code-switching between Sranan Tongo and Dutch is also common in computer-mediated communication. \nPeople often greet each other in Sranan Tongo by saying, for example, \"fa waka\" (how are you), instead of the more formal Dutch \"hoe gaat het\" (how are you).\n\nAs a written language, Sranan Tongo has existed since the late 19th century. An official orthography was adopted by the government of Suriname on July 15, 1986 in Resolution 4501. A few writers have used Sranan in their work, most notably the poet Henri Frans de Ziel (\"Trefossa\"), who also wrote \"God zij met ons Suriname\", Suriname's national anthem, whose second verse is sung in Sranan Tongo.\n\n\n"}

A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey.\n\nTeam sports are practiced between opposing teams, where the players interact directly and simultaneously between them to achieve an objective. The objective generally involves teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar object in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points.\n\nThe meaning of a \"team sport\" has been disputed in recent years. Some types of sports have different objectives or rules than \"traditional\" team sports. These types of team sports do not involve teammates facilitating the movement of a ball or similar item in accordance with a set of rules, in order to score points. For example, swimming, rowing, sailing, dragon boat racing, and track and field among others can also be considered team sports.\nIn other types of team sports, there may not be an opposing team or point scoring, for example, mountaineering. Instead of points scored against an opposing team, the relative difficulty of the climb or walk is the measure of the achievement. In some sports where participants are entered by a team, they do not only compete against members of other teams but also against each other for points towards championship standings. For example, motorsport, particularly Formula One. In cycling however, team members whilst still in competition with each other, will also work towards assisting one, usually a specialist, member of the team to the highest possible finishing position. This process is known as team orders and although previously accepted was banned in Formula One between 2002 and 2010. After a controversy involving team orders at the 2010 German Grand Prix however, the regulation was removed as of the season.\n\nThrough the years, the popularity of team sport has continued to grow, positively influencing not just athletes, but also fans, local and national economies. All over the world, the impact of team sport can be seen as professional athletes live out their dreams while serving as role models, youth athletes develop life skills and follow in the footsteps of their role models, fans bond over the love of their teams while supporting their economies with their support.\n\nTraces of sprinting as a team sport extend back several thousand years - as evidenced in images in the cave in Lascaux in France which depict people running after animals or \"vice versa\"; this was an issue of survival of the fittest.\nOrganized athletics in Greece traditionally date back to 776 BC, with ongoing activity recorded up to 393 BC. These ancient Olympic Games tested warrior skills and consisted of running, jumping or leaping, wrestling (combat sport), and javelin throw. In the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia, Neolithic-era cave paintings dating to 7000 BC depict a wrestling match surrounded by crowds. Prehistoric cave-paintings in Japan show a sport similar to sumo wrestling. In Wadi Sura, near Gilf Kebir in Libya, a Neolithic rock painting in the cave of swimmers shows evidence of swimming and archery being practiced around 6000 BC.\n\nThe term \"athlete\", according to mythology, derives from the name of Aethlius,\nthe mythological first King of Elis (the location of Olympia) in Greece. The practice of young athletes carrying flaming torches is also traced to the King of Elis, under whose supervision the games took place; some historians regard this as the first record of Olympic sprint racing. Before the start of the races gods were invoked by offerings of mostly fruits and vegetables. The winner of the race was crowned with a wreath of olive or laurel and celery sticks were offered as a trophy. In subsequent years monetary attractions were introduced as prize money. However, the practice of offering celery sticks is still in vogue in the 100 m sprint in the Olympics.\n\nThe present-day pattern of Olympic Games resembles the practice followed in ancient times. Sprint was the coveted event. The 200 m sprint is known in Greek as \"short foot race\". The 400 m race is equivalent to two \"stades\" and called \"diaulos\" in Greek.\n\nSeven team sports are currently on the program of the Summer Olympics. Cricket's inclusion in the 2024 Summer Olympics depends on the decision of the International Cricket Council and its members. A cricket tournament formed part of the Summer Olympics in 1900, although only one match was played, between teams representing Great Britain and France. However, the British team was effectively a club touring side and the French players were drawn partly from expatriates living in Paris.\n\nIce hockey and curling are team sports at the Winter Olympics together with the bobsleigh competition where the men's event has classes for both two-man and four-man sleds, but the women's class is restricted to two persons only.\n\nAll Olympic team sports include competitions for both men and women.\n\n\n"}

Although not considered canon because of later developments in the \"Star Trek\" movies and TV series, the presentation of Klingon culture in this novel and Ford's 1987 follow-on, \"How Much for Just the Planet?\" is highly popular in fanon alternate depictions of Klingon society and culture. In particular, the fictional Klingon language \"klingonaase\" is introduced here, in advance of the creation of the canon version of the Klingon language, \"tlhIngan Hol\".\n\nParticular aspects of Klingon society depicted include:\n\n\nThe novel concerns an intergenerational conflict within the Klingon government, between a faction wanting war with the Federation and a faction desiring accommodation for fear of Klingon defeat. The Klingon ambassador and his associates play a surprising role in this conflict, one which remains secret until the publication of a \"tell-all\" book forty years later, one which is read by Captain James T.

She was a professional historian, a subject which she read at Oxford and in which she lectured for some 30 years in India. She was one of the first Asian women to enter Oxford University. She authored two books and numerous scholarly articles about the history of India.\n\nZubaida Yazdani was one of the first Asian women to enter Oxford University. She authored two books and numerous scholarly articles about the history of India. Her book titled \"Hyderabad during the residency of Henry Russell 1811-1820\" was a scholarly exposition of the Indian Subsidiary Alliance system. Her other book titled \"The Seventh Nizam: The Fallen Empire\" was a memoir of the last Nizam of Hyderabad and also a study of the constitutional and political complexities which surrounded the relations of the Indian states with the British raj. Her books broke new ground and were based on painstaking use of original documents, many of which had been overlooked by previous investigators. They enforced the revision of some hitherto accepted judgements. She also supervised the translation of a novel, Taubat al Nusuh,from Urdu into English. This is an important and groundbreaking work in Urdu by Nazir Ahmad Dehlvi who was the first novel writer in Urdu and also an eminent scholar whose publications promoted the education of Muslim men and women. Zubaida Yazdani was also involved in social and educational work. She was one of the main founders of a college in Hyderabad for underprivileged women. She also started the Hyderabad School for Languages and Science in London, teaching primary, junior and secondary pupils in Urdu as well as the curriculum subjects of English, Mathematics, Computer Studies, French, and Arabic to students from primary to O and A Levels.\n\nZubaida Yazdani was the oldest daughter of Ghulam Yazdani, D.Litt. who was himself an eminent historian and archeologist. He is considered an authority on the history of the Deccan and had numerous publications about the history of south India. He was the Director of Archeology in the Nizam’s government in Hyderabad and was instrumental in the preservation of the caves at Ajanta and Ellora which are masterpieces of Buddhist and Hindu religious art. He was awarded an OBE by the British government and a Padma Bhushan (one of India’s highest civil honors) by the Indian government[7]. Zubaida Yazdani was married to Mir Yaseen Ali Khan, who was an accomplished Urdu poet and published in the leading literary magazines of India.\n\nZubaida Yazdani passed her Senior Cambridge exams with high marks from Mahboobia School. Her father recognized her talents and came with her to Britain at his own expense so she could sit for the Oxford university entrance examination. Zubaida Yazdani travelled to Oxford in 1935 and sat for the entrance exam for St. Hilda’s college and after interviews was accepted. She writes in her own words that the students \"came mostly from the British middle classes and aristocracy… not only academically the cream of English society but in their manners … very humble and living… paid great respect to their tutors\".\n\nZubaida Yazdani was one of the first Asian women to enter Oxford University and was a contemporary of Indira Gandhi (late Prime Minister of India). Her own example gave an incentive for other Hyderabadi students to come to Oxford for higher studies. When asked many years later during an interview about her memories of Indira Gandhi, Zubaida Yazdani commented that \"She was a very shy student. She spoke little in lectures and discussions.\"\n\nZubaida Yazdani got her degree at Oxford in June 1940. After the outbreak of World War ll, she was determined to stay on and do post graduate studies at Oxford. In her own words:\n\nstudents pursued normal courses, contented themselves with lunches of cheese sandwiches and apples, and used the shelters only when the sirens sounded.\n\nShe was asked by her family to come back because of the dangers the war presented.\n\nThe Suez Canal had closed by that time and it would have been exceedingly dangerous to go back via that route as the war raged on in Europe and the Middle East. So she had to go to India via USA. She had to travel to USA from Britain across the Atlantic in a ship which dodged German U Boats which patrolled the Atlantic and sank 175 allied warships and 3500 merchant ships. She arrived back on the east coast of India in Calcutta after a perilous journey of nearly three months via New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong. Her overjoyed parents went from Hyderabad to Calcutta to receive her.\n\nOn her return home to Hyderabad she was appointed Lecturer (1942) and then Reader (1947) in History at the Women’s College, Osmania university. She started M.A. classes there. She taught there for many years and also conducted and published research while teaching there.\n\nZubaida Yazdani however had a great desire to pursue postgraduate education. Indian teaching staff with more than 10 years of service were allowed two years leave with full pay. She left for Britain in March 1963 and started attending post graduate classes at London university School of Oriental and African Studies and later transferred to Oxford university where she completed her postgraduate studies at St. Hilda’s college.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1969 she was Senior Reader at the Women’s college, Osmania university and was also its acting principal. Then she became Reader in History at the Arts college, Osmania university and finally head of its History department.\n\nZubaida Yazdani retired in 1976 and came to Britain with her husband, Mir Yaseen Ali Khan because two of her sons Hussain and Hassan were already residents in Britain. She then wrote (with Mary Crystal) her second book, \"The Seventh Nizam: The Fallen Empire\"\n\nZubaida Yazdani passed away in London on 11 June 1996.\n\nZubaida Yazdani published her first book \"Hyderabad during the Residency of Henry Russell 1811 – 1820\". The book was based on her B.Litt. thesis at Oxford university. It was a scholarly work based on original sources which were available at the Bodleian library at Oxford which housed the Russell and Palmer papers. She was the first to make a detailed study of these voluminous papers. Rushbrook Williams (CBE, FRSA), who was a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford wrote in the preface to the book that the study breaks new ground and enforces the revision of hitherto accepted judgments and is an unbiased and thorough investigation of the subject.\n\nZubaida Yazdani published her second book titled \"The Seventh Nizam: The Fallen Empire\" in 1985. The book is a study of Hyderabad under the Seventh Nizam (1911–48), the greatest of the Asaf Jahi rulers of Hyderabad. It also embraces a study of the British government’s policies towards the Indian states. It also shows the effects of the two world wars on British policy up to the time when India and Pakistan became independent. The book was a scholarly work based on original papers that were obtained from the India Office library in London as well as original papers of the Nizam that were made available to her by the Nizam’s family. Many of these papers have never been studied before this book was published. The book painstakingly document’s the source of all materials and provides voluminous references.\n\nThe preface for the book was written by Gordon Johnson (Director of the Cambridge university center for South Asian studies and President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (2015–18)) who wrote that not only does the study chronicle the live of the last Nizam but also the complexities of the relationship of the Indian States with the British raj which is an often ignored aspect of Indian history. Dr. Gordon wrote that the study thus contributes to our understanding of modern political developments in the sub-continent.\n\nZubaida Yazdani also supervised the translation from Urdu into English, of a novel titled Taubat al Nusuh written by Nazir Ahmad Dehlvi who was the first Urdu novelist. Nazir Ahmed was a contemporary of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and was concerned with the reform and education of Muslims particularly Muslim women. Taubat al Nusuh is considered by many to be the first novel written in Urdu.\n\nZubaida Yazdani also wrote numerous papers and articles which were presented at scholarly conferences.\n\nZubaida Yazdani was always involved in social and educational work in particular for the benefit of the underprivileged. However her work in the establishment of a women’s college stands out. While Zubaida Yazdani was working as a Reader in history at the Women's college, Osmania university she noticed that because of the increased number of women seeking admission, the underprivileged women were finding it difficult to get admission to the existing women’s colleges. A branch of the Federation of University Women was established at Hyderabad, under the name of the University Women’s Cultural Association and she was appointed its Secretary. Zubaida Yazdani presented her proposal for the establishment of a new women's college to the Association and the proposal was accepted by Sri Devi the principal of the Women's College who highly encouraged the project. However the association was concerned about the lack of resources for such an undertaking because not a rupee was available for this proposal. Zubaida Yazdani went door to door to raise funds from wealthy individuals and businesses. She was also able to get teachers to agree to teach in the college with the condition that for the first year they would only receive Rupees 20 to Rupees 25 per month. This was an extremely low salary for teachers in those days. There was also no building for the proposed college. So she approached Sultan Bazar library because their buildings were empty all day and the administration of the library agreed to let the college use their buildings temporarily. Then the college was started with an initial enrollment of about 35 students[10]. An incident that occurred during this time speaks to the unshakable determination and dedication of Zubaida Yazdani. The Sultan Bazaar library eventually wanted their rooms back and decided to make the college leave by locking the doors to the building. They would not listen to any requests from the college. Zubaida Yazdani faced this crisis in her usual determined way. She told the students to go home and that it was a college holiday for them and to come back to the same place the next day and they would be informed of the college’s new location. She also told the teachers to come back the next day at their usual time and they would then go to the new premises. The teachers were astonished because there weren’t any new buildings to move to. She then went home and took her teenaged son with her and took him with her and went to meet the President and Secretary of the Sir Nizamat Jung Trust library. She requested that the halls and rooms of the library be rented out to the college. The President and Secretary of the library said that we will form a committee and then we will let you know their decision. Zubaida Yazdani told them that by the time the committee is formed the college will be finished. The President and Secretary then asked her more questions about the college. They were so impressed by her determination and dedication and also that she was not about to take no for an answer that they gave her the keys to the halls and rooms the same day. The next day when the students and teachers came back to the college, they were met by a smiling Zubaida Yazdani who gave them directions to the new college building. Eventually the college moved to a more permanent location. Under her leadership the college started arts classes in history, economics and sociology for underprivileged girls. Then science classes were started and a library and laboratory were set up, with very satisfactory results. Zubaida Yazdani wanted that the college should be affiliated with Osmania university. One lakh rupees (Rs.100,000) were needed for the proposal. The Osmania university graduates association office bearer Rai Shankar Ji took the fully functional college under the sponsorship of the Association. And In 1961, despite opposition, the U.W.C.A. college was affiliated to Osmania University. It is now, under its Hindi name, Sarojini Naidu Vanitha Maha Vidyalaya, one of the largest women’s colleges in Telangana state. It is located in Nampally area of Hyderabad.\n\nZubaida Yazdani’s son Hussain Ali Khan who as a child was often her companion on fund raising trips wrote the following about her, \"About the founding of the college for women; she felt the need for such an Institution as there were not adequate places and opportunities for women whom she believed strongly in. When she made up her mind about something she felt strongly about, there was no stopping her and there was no word like NO in her dictionary of life. In the days of old it was not the IN thing for women to go to rich or powerful men’s houses or see them personally on their own so I being a very young teenaged son used to accompany her on these missions of gathering funds for the cause from powerful bankers, heads of companies, directors etc. As the occasion demanded her charisma and powers of persuasion at convincing the great and the good were like magic and they were like putty in her hands and it was extraordinary to watch\".\n\nZubaida Yazdani also established the Hyderabad School for Languages and Sciences in Hackney in London. The school was started in February 1981 because she had been approached by parents of children from Hyderabad and Pakistan to teach Urdu. She and her husband, Mir Yaseen Ali Khan, initially taught the classes, but after a few months the Inner London Education Authority visited the school and awarded a grant. After that the school was able to employ more teachers. The school taught primary, junior and secondary pupils in Urdu up the O and A level. The school also taught English, Arabic, and Science subjects. The school closed some years after Zubaida Yazdanis death.\n\nZubaida Yazdani was also an office bearer in various Urdu and History associations and published research in academic journals\n\n"}
