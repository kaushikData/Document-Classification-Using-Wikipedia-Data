{"id": "36170582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36170582", "title": "Arabic verbs", "text": "Arabic verbs\n\nArabic verbs ( '; '), like the verbs in other Semitic languages, and the entire vocabulary in those languages, are based on a set of two, three, four and also five (but mainly three) consonants called a root (\"triliteral\" or \"quadriliteral\" according to the number of consonants). The root communicates the basic meaning of the verb, e.g. كتب ' 'write', قرء ' 'read', أكل \" 'eat'. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as person, gender, number, tense, mood, and voice.\n\nVarious categories are marked on verbs:\n\nWeakness is an inherent property of a given verb determined by the particular consonants of the verb root (corresponding to a verb conjugation in Classical Latin and other European languages), with five main types of weakness and two or three subtypes of each type.\n\nArabic grammarians typically use the root فعل ' to indicate the particular shape of any given element of a verbal paradigm. As an example, the form يتكاتب ' 'he is corresponded (with)' would be listed generically as يتفاعل \", specifying the generic shape of a strong Form VI passive verb, third-person masculine singular present indicative.\n\nThe maximum possible total number of verb forms derivable from a root — not counting participles and verbal nouns — is approximately 13 person/number/gender forms; times 7.385 tense/mood combinations, counting the \"\" future (since the moods are active only in the present tense, and the imperative has only 5 of the 13 paradigmatic forms); times 17 form/voice combinations (since forms IX, XI–XV exist only for a small number of stative roots, and form VII cannot normally form a passive), for a total of 1,632. Each of these has its own stem form, and each of these stem forms itself comes in numerous varieties, according to the weakness (or lack thereof) of the underlying root.\n\nEach particular lexical verb is specified by four stems, two each for the active and passive voices. In a particular voice, one stem (the \"past stem\") is used for the past tense, and the other (the \"non-past stem\") is used for the present and future tenses, along with non-indicative moods, e.g. subjunctive and imperative. The past and non-past stems are sometimes also called the \"perfective stem\" and \"imperfective stem\", respectively, based on a traditional misinterpretation of Arabic stems as representing grammatical aspect rather than grammatical tense. (Although there is still some disagreement about the interpretation of the stems as tense or aspect, the dominant current view is that the stems simply represent tense, sometimes of a relative rather than absolute nature. There are some unusual usages of the stems in certain contexts that were once interpreted as indicating aspectual distinctions, but are now thought to simply be idiosyncratic constructions that do not neatly fit into any aspectual paradigm.)\n\nTo the past stem, suffixes are added to mark the verb for person, number and gender, while to the non-past stem, a combination of prefixes and suffixes are added. (Very approximately, the prefixes specify the person and the suffixes indicate number and gender.) A total of 13 forms exist for each of the two stems, specifying person (first, second or third); number (singular, dual or plural); and gender (masculine or feminine).\n\nThere are six separate moods in the non-past: indicative, imperative, subjunctive, jussive, short energetic and long energetic. The moods are generally marked by suffixes. When no number suffix is present, the endings are ' for indicative, ' for subjunctive, no ending for imperative and jussive, ـَنْ ' for shorter energetic, ـَنَّ ' for longer energetic. When number suffixes are present, the moods are either distinguished by different forms of the suffixes (e.g. ـُونَ ' for masculine plural indicative vs. ـُو ' for masculine plural subjunctive/imperative/jussive), or not distinguished at all. The imperative exists only in the second person and is distinguished from the jussive by the lack of the normal second-person prefix ـت \"\".\n\nThe third person masculine singular past tense form serves as the \"dictionary form\" used to identify a verb, similar to the infinitive in English. (Arabic has no infinitive.) For example, the verb meaning 'write' is often specified as كَتَبَ ', which actually means 'he wrote'. This indicates that the past-tense stem is كَتَبْـ '; the corresponding non-past stem is ـكْتُبْـ ', as in يَكْتُبُ ' 'he writes'.\n\nThere are three tenses in Arabic: the past tense ( '), the present tense ( ') and the future tense. The future tense in Classical Arabic is formed by adding either the prefix ' or the separate word ' onto the beginning of the present tense verb, e.g. or 'he will write'.\n\nIn some contexts, the tenses represent aspectual distinctions rather than tense distinctions. The usage of Arabic tenses is as follows:\n\nIn all but Form I, there is only one possible shape for each of the past and non-past stems for a given root. In Form I, however, different verbs have different shapes. Examples:\nNotice that the second vowel can be any of ' in both past and non-past stems. The vowel ' occurs in most past stems, while ' occurs in some (especially intransitive) and ' occurs only in a few stative verbs (i.e. whose meaning is 'be X' or 'become X' where X is an adjective). The most common patterns are:\n\nThere are three moods ( ', a word that also means \"cases\"; '), whose forms are derived from the imperfective stem: the indicative mood ( '), usually ending in '; the subjunctive ( '), usually ending in '; and the jussive ( \"), with no ending. In less formal Arabic and in spoken dialects, the final vowels of the indicative and subjunctive are not pronounced, making them identical to jussive.\n\nThe imperative ( ') (positive, only 2nd person) is formed by dropping the verbal prefix from the imperfective jussive stem, e.g. ' 'present!'. If the result starts with two consonants followed by a vowel (' or '), an elidible is added to the beginning of the word, usually pronounced as \", e.g. ' 'wash!' or ' 'do!' if the present form vowel is ', then the alif is also pronounced as ', e.g. \"\" 'write!'. Negative imperatives are formed from the jussive.\n\nThe exception to the above rule is the form (or stem) IV verbs. In these verbs a non-elidible alif pronounced as ' is always prefixed to the imperfect jussive form, e.g. ' \"send!\", \" 'add!'.\n\nThe subjunctive is used in subordinate clauses after certain conjunctions. The jussive is used in negation, in negative imperatives, and in the hortative \"+jussive. For example: 2. m.:\n\nArabic has two verbal voices ( ' \"forms\", '), active ( '), and passive ( '). The passive voice is expressed by a change in vocalization. For example:\n\nThus, the active and passive forms are spelled identically in Arabic; only their vowel markings differ.\n\nEvery verb has a corresponding active participle, and most have passive participles. E.g. معلم ' 'teacher' is the active participle to stem II. of the root علم ' ('know').\n\nIn addition to a participle, there is a verbal noun (in Arabic, ', ', literally meaning 'source'), sometimes called a gerund, which is similar to English gerunds and verb-derived nouns of various sorts (e.g. \"running\" and \"a run\" from \"to run\"; \"objection\" from \"to object\"). As shown by the English examples, its meaning refers both to the act of doing something and (by frequent semantic extension) to its result. One of its syntactic functions is as a verbal complement of another verb, and this usage it corresponds to the English gerund or infinitive (\"He prevented me from running or \"He began to run).\n\nSome well-known examples of verbal nouns are فتح \" (see Fatah) (Form I), تنظيم \"\" (Form II), جهاد \"\" (Form III), إسلام \"\" (Form IV), انتفاضة \"\" (feminine of Form VIII verbal noun), and استقلال \"\" (Form X).\n\nThe system of verb conjugations in Arabic is quite complicated, and is formed along two axes. One axis, known as the \"form\" (described as \"Form I\", \"Form II\", etc.), is used to specify grammatical concepts such as causative, intensive, reciprocal, passive or reflexive, and involves varying the stem form. The other axis, known as the \"weakness\", is determined by the particular consonants making up the root. For example, \"defective\" (or \"third-weak\") verbs have a و ' or ي ' as the last root consonant (e.g. رمي ' 'throw', دعو ' 'call'), and \"doubled\" verbs have the second and third consonants the same (e.g. مدد \"\" 'extend'). These \"weaknesses\" have the effect of inducing various irregularities in the stems and endings of the associated verbs.\n\nExamples of the different forms of a sound verb (i.e. with no root weaknesses), from the root كتب ' 'write' (using حمر ' 'red' for Form IX, which is limited to colors and physical defects):\nThe main types of weakness are as follows:\n\nIn Arabic the grammatical person and number as well as the mood are designated by a variety of prefixes and suffixes. The following table shows the paradigm of a regular sound Form I verb, ' () 'to write'. Most of the final short vowels are often omitted in speech, except the vowel of the feminine plural ending ', and normally the vowel of the past tense second person feminine singular ending \"\".\n\nThe initial vowel in the imperative (which is elidable) varies from verb to verb, as follows:\n\nIn unvocalised Arabic, ', ', ' and ' are all written the same: . Forms ' and ' (and sometimes even ') can be abbreviated to ' in spoken Arabic and in pausa, making them also sound the same.\n\nRoots containing one or two of the radicals و ' ('), ي ' (' ) or ء ' (') often lead to verbs with special phonological rules because these radicals can be influenced by their surroundings. Such verbs are called \"weak\" (\"verba infirma\", 'weak verbs') and their paradigms must be given special attention. In the case of ', these peculiarities are mainly orthographical, since ' is not subject to elision (the orthography of ء ' and ا ' is unsystematic due to confusion in early Islamic times). According to the position of the weak radical in the root, the root can be classified into four classes: \"first weak\", \"second weak\", \"third weak\" and \"doubled\", where both the second and third radicals are identical. Some roots fall into more than one category at once.\n\nMost first-weak verbs have a و as their first radical. These verbs are entirely regular in the past tense. In the non-past, the drops out, leading to a shorter stem (e.g. (وجد (يجد ' 'to find'), where the stem is ـجدـ in place of a longer stem like ـجلدـ from the verb (جلد (يجلد ' 'to whip, flog'. This same stem is used throughout, and there are no other irregularities except for the imperative, which has no initial vowel, consistent with the fact that the stem for the imperative begins with only one consonant.\n\nThe are various types of assimilated (first-weak) Form I verbs:\nThe following shows a paradigm of a typical Form I hollow (second-weak) verb (قال (قلت، يقول ' 'to say', parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ' type. See notes following the table for explanation.\n\nAll hollow (second-weak) verbs are conjugated in a parallel fashion. The endings are identical to strong verbs, but there are two stems (a longer and a shorter) in each of the past and non-past. The longer stem is consistently used whenever the ending begins with a vowel, and the shorter stem is used in all other circumstances. The longer stems end in a long vowel plus consonant, while the shorter stems end in a short vowel plus consonant. The shorter stem is formed simply by shortening the vowel of the long stem in \"all paradigms other than the active past of Form I verbs\". In the active past paradigms of Form I, however, the longer stem always has an ' vowel, while the shorter stem has a vowel ' or \" corresponding to the actual second root consonant of the verb.\n\nNo initial vowel is needed in the imperative forms because the non-past stem does not begin with two consonants.\n\nThere are various types of Form I hollow verbs:\n\nThe passive paradigm of all Form I hollow verbs is as follows:\n\nThe following shows a paradigm of a typical Form I defective (third-weak) verb (رمى (يرمي ' 'to throw', parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ' type. See notes following the table for explanation.\n\nEach of the two main stems (past and non-past) comes in two variants, a full and a shortened. For the past stem, the full is رميـ ', shortened to رمـ ' in much of the third person (i.e. before vowels, in most cases). For the non-past stem, the full is ', shortened to ' before '. The full non-past stem ـرميـ ' appears as ـرميـ \" when not before a vowel; this is an automatic alternation in Classical Arabic. The places where the shortened stems occur are indicated by silver (past), gold (non-past).\n\nThe endings are actually mostly regular. But some endings are irregular, in boldface:\n\nThe following shows a paradigm of a typical Form I defective (third-weak) verb (دعا (يدعو ' 'to call', parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ' type. Verbs of this sort are entirely parallel to verbs of the (فعا (يفعي \" type, although the exact forms can still be tricky. See notes following the table for explanation.\n\nVerbs of this sort are work nearly identically to verbs of the (فعى (يفعي \" type. There are the same irregular endings in the same places, and again two stems in each of the past and non-past tenses, with the same stems used in the same places:\n\nThe Arabic spelling has the following rules:\n\nThe following shows a paradigm of a typical Form I defective (third-weak) verb ' 'to forget', parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ' type. These verbs differ in a number of significant respects from either of the above types.\n\nThis variant is somewhat different from the variants with ـِي ' or ـُو ' in the non-past. As with other third-weak verbs, there are multiple stems in each of the past and non-past, a full stem composed following the normal rules and one or more shortened stems.\n\nThe endings are actually mostly regular. But some endings are irregular in the non-past, in boldface:\n\nThe following shows a paradigm of a typical Form I doubled verb (مد (يمد ' 'to extend', parallel to verbs of the (فعل (يفعل ' type. See notes following the table for explanation.\n\nAll doubled verbs are conjugated in a parallel fashion. The endings are for the most part identical to those of strong verbs, but there are two stems (a regular and a modified) in each of the past and non-past. The regular stems are identical to the stem forms of sound verbs, while the modified stems have the two identical consonants pulled together into a geminate consonant and the vowel between moved before the geminate. In the above verb (مد (يمد ' 'to extend' (s.th.), the past stems are مددـ ' (regular), مدـ ' (modified), and the non-past stems are مددـ ' (regular), مدـ \" (modified). In the table, places where the regular past stem occurs are in silver, and places where the regular non-past stem occurs are in gold; everywhere else, the modified stem occurs.\n\nNo initial vowel is needed in most of the imperative forms because the modified non-past stem does not begin with two consonants.\n\nThe concept of having two stems for each tense, one for endings beginning with vowels and one for other endings, occurs throughout the different kinds of weaknesses.\n\nFollowing the above rules, endingless jussives would have a form like تمدد ', while the corresponding indicatives and subjunctives would have forms like تمد ', تمد '. As a result, for the doubled verbs in particular, there is a tendency to harmonize these forms by adding a vowel to the jussives, usually ', sometimes \"\". These are the only irregular endings in these paradigms, and have been indicated in boldface. The masculine singular imperative likewise has multiple forms, based on the multiple forms of the jussive.\n\nThe are various types of doubled Form I verbs:\nArabic verb morphology includes augmentations of the root, also known as forms, an example of the derived stems found among the Semitic languages. For a typical verb based on a triliteral root (i.e. a root formed using three root consonants), the basic form is termed Form I, while the augmented forms are known as Form II, Form III, etc. The forms in normal use are Form I through Form X; Forms XI through XV exist but are rare and obsolescent. Forms IX and XI are used only with adjectival roots referring to colors and physical defects (e.g. \"red\", \"blue\", \"blind\", \"deaf\", etc.), and are stative verbs having the meaning of \"be X\" or \"become X\" (e.g. Form IX ' 'be red, become red, blush', Form XI ' with the same meaning). Although the \"structure\" that a given root assumes in a particular augmentation is predictable, its \"meaning\" is not (although many augmentations have one or more \"usual\" or prototypical meanings associated with them), and not all augmentations exist for any given root. As a result, these augmentations are part of the system of derivational morphology, not part of the inflectional system.\n\nThe construction of a given augmentation is normally indicated using the dummy root (ف–ع–ل), based on the verb ' 'to do'. Because Arabic has no direct equivalent to the infinitive form of Western languages, the third-person masculine singular past tense is normally used as the \"dictionary form\" of a given verb, i.e. the form by which a verb is identified in a dictionary or grammatical discussion. Hence, the word ' above actually has the meaning of 'he did', but is translated as 'to do' when used as a dictionary form.\n\nVerbs based on quadriliteral roots (roots with four consonants) also exist. There are four augmentations for such verbs, known as Forms Iq, IIq, IIIq and IVq. These have forms similar to Forms II, V, VII and IX respectively of triliteral verbs. Forms IIIq and IVq are fairly rare. The construction of such verbs is typically given using the dummy verb '. However, the choice of this particular verb is somewhat non-ideal in that the third and fourth consonants of an actual verb are typically not the same, despite the same consonant used for both; this is a particular problem e.g. for Form IVq. The verb tables below use the dummy verb ' instead.\n\nSome grammars, especially of colloquial spoken varieties rather than of Classical Arabic, use other dummy roots. For example, \"A Short Reference Grammar of Iraqi Arabic\" (Wallace M. Erwin) uses فمل ' and فستل ' for three and four-character roots, respectively (standing for \"First Middle Last\" and \"First Second Third Last\"). Commonly the dummy consonants are given in capital letters.\n\nThe system of identifying verb augmentations by Roman numerals is an invention by Western scholars. Traditionally, Arabic grammarians did not number the augmentations at all, instead identifying them by the corresponding dictionary form. For example, Form V would be called \"the \"\" form\".\nEach form can have either active or passive forms in the past and non-past tenses, so reflexives are different from passives.\n\nNote that the present passive of forms I and IV are the same. Otherwise there is no confusion.\n\nSound verbs are those verbs with no associated irregularities in their constructions. Verbs with irregularities are known as \"weak verbs\"; generally, this occurs either with (1) verbs based on roots where one or more of the consonants (or \"radicals\") is ' (', و), ' (', ي) or the glottal stop \"\" (\"hamzah\", ﺀ); or (2) verbs where the second and third root consonants are the same.\n\nSome verbs that would be classified as \"weak\" according to the consonants of the verb root are nevertheless conjugated as a strong verb. This happens, for example:\n\nForm VIII has a ـتـ -\"t\"- that is infixed into the root, directly after the first root consonant. This ـتـ -\"t\"- assimilates to certain coronal consonants occurring as the first root consonant. In particular, with roots whose first consonant is د، ز، ث، ذ، ص، ط، ض، ظ \"d z th dh ṣ ṭ ḍ ẓ\", the combination of root and infix ت \"t\" appears as دّ، زد، ثّ، ذّ، صط، طّ، ضط، ظّ \"dd zd thth dhdh ṣṭ ṭṭ ḍṭ ẓẓ\". That is, the \"t\" assimilates the emphasis of the emphatic consonants ص، ط، ض، ظ \"ṣ ṭ ḍ ẓ\" and the voicing of د، ز \"d z\", and assimilates entirely to the interdental consonants ث، ذ، ظ \"th dh ẓ\". The consonant cluster ضط \"ḍṭ\", as in اضطرّ ' 'compel, force', is unexpected given modern pronunciation, having a voiced stop next to a voiceless one; this reflects the fact that ط ' was formerly pronounced voiced, and ض ' was pronounced as the emphatic equivalent not of د ' but of an unusual lateral sound. (ض \"\" was possibly an emphatic voiced alveolar lateral fricative or a similar affricated sound or ; see the article on the letter ض \"ḍād\".)\n\nOther than for Form I active, there is only one possible form for each verb, regardless of whether the third root consonant is و ' or ي '. All of the derived third-weak verbs have the same active-voice endings as (فعى (يفعي ' verbs except for Forms V and VI, which have past-tense endings like (فعى (يفعي ' verbs but non-past endings like (فعي (يفعى ' verbs. The passive-voice endings of all third-weak verbs (whether Form I or derived) are the same as for the (فعي (يفعى ' verbs. The verbal nouns have various irregularities: feminine in Form II, \"-in\" declension in Form V and VI, glottal stop in place of root \"w/y\" in Forms VII–X.\n\nThe active and passive participles of derived defective verbs consistently are of the \"-in\" and \"-an\" declensions, respectively.\n\nDefective Form IX verbs are extremely rare. Heywood and Nahmad list one such verb, ' 'be/become blind', which does not follow the expected form اعميّ '. They also list a similarly rare Form XI verb اعمايّ ' 'be/become blind' — this time with the expected form.\n\nOnly the forms with irregularities are shown. The missing forms are entirely regular, with \"w\" or \"y\" appearing as the second radical, depending on the root. There are unexpected feminine forms of the verbal nouns of Form IV, X.\n\nWhen the first radical is \"w\", it drops out in the Form I non-past. Most of the derived forms are regular, except that the sequences \"uw iw\" are assimilated to \"ū ī\", and the sequence \"wt\" in Form VIII is assimilated to \"tt\" throughout the paradigm. The following table only shows forms with irregularities in them.\n\nThe initial \"w\" also drops out in the common Form I verbal noun ' (e.g. ' 'arrival, link' from \"\" 'arrive').\n\nWhen the first radical is \"y\", the forms are largely regular. The following table only shows forms that have some irregularities in them, indicated in boldface.\n\nThe largest problem with so-called \"hamzated\" verbs (those with a glottal stop \"ʾ\" or \"hamzah\" as any of the root consonants) is the complicated way of writing such verbs in the Arabic script (see the article on hamzah for the rules regarding this). In pronunciation, these verbs are in fact almost entirely regular.\n\nThe only irregularity occurs in verbs with a hamzah as the first radical. A phonological rule in Classical Arabic disallows the occurrence of two hamzahs in a row separated by a short vowel, assimilating the second to the preceding vowel (hence \"ʾaʾ ʾiʾ ʾuʾ\" become \"ʾā ʾī ʾū\"). This affects the following forms:\n\nIn addition, any place where a \"\" (elidable hamzah) occurs will \"optionally\" undergo this transformation. This affects the following forms:\n\nThere are the following irregularities:\n\nDoubly weak verbs have two \"weak\" radicals; a few verbs are also triply weak. Generally, the above rules for weak verbs apply in combination, as long as they do not conflict. The following are cases where two types of weaknesses apply in combination:\n\nThe following are examples where weaknesses would conflict, and hence one of the \"weak\" radicals is treated as strong:\n\nThe following are cases with special irregularities:\n\nThe vowels for the various forms are summarized in this table:\nSee also .\n\nThe Classical Arabic system of verbs is largely unchanged in the colloquial spoken varieties of Arabic. The same derivational system of augmentations exists, including triliteral Forms I through X and quadriliteral Forms I and II, constructed largely in the same fashion (the rare triliteral Forms XI through XV and quadriliteral Forms III and IV have vanished). The same system of weaknesses (strong, defective/third-weak, hollow/second-weak, assimilated/first-weak, doubled) also exists, again constructed largely in the same fashion. Within a given verb, two stems (past and non-past) still exist along with the same two systems of affixes (suffixing past-tense forms and prefixing/suffixing non-past forms).\n\nThe largest changes are within a given paradigm, with a significant reduction in the number of forms. The following is an example of a regular verb paradigm in Egyptian Arabic.\n\nThis paradigm shows clearly the reduction in the number of forms:\n\nIn addition, Form IV is lost entirely in most varieties, except for a few \"classicizing\" verbs (i.e. verbs borrowed from Modern Standard Arabic).\n\nSee varieties of Arabic for more information on grammar differences in the spoken varieties.\n"}

{"id": "4163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4163", "title": "Bertrand Russell", "text": "Bertrand Russell\n\nBertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, (; 18 May 1872 – 2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, political activist, and Nobel laureate. At various points in his life, Russell considered himself a liberal, a socialist and a pacifist, but he also admitted that he had \"never been any of these things, in any profound sense.\" Russell was born in Monmouthshire into one of the most prominent aristocratic families in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Russell led the British \"revolt against idealism\". He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, colleague G. E. Moore and protégé Ludwig Wittgenstein. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians. With A. N. Whitehead he wrote \"Principia Mathematica\", an attempt to create a logical basis for mathematics. His philosophical essay \"On Denoting\" has been considered a \"paradigm of philosophy\". His work has had a considerable influence on mathematics, logic, set theory, linguistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computer science (see type theory and type system) and philosophy, especially the philosophy of language, epistemology and metaphysics.\n\nRussell was a prominent anti-war activist and he championed anti-imperialism. Occasionally, he advocated preventive nuclear war, before the opportunity provided by the atomic monopoly had passed and \"welcomed with enthusiasm\" world government. He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I. Later, Russell concluded that war against Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany was a necessary \"lesser of two evils\" and criticized Stalinist totalitarianism, attacked the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War and was an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament. In 1950, Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought\".\n\nBertrand Russell was born on 18 May 1872 at Ravenscroft, Trellech, Monmouthshire, into an influential and liberal family of the British aristocracy. His parents, Viscount and Viscountess Amberley, were radical for their times. Lord Amberley consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the biologist Douglas Spalding. Both were early advocates of birth control at a time when this was considered scandalous. Lord Amberley was an atheist and his atheism was evident when he asked the philosopher John Stuart Mill to act as Russell's secular godfather. Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings had a great effect on Russell's life.\n\nHis paternal grandfather, the Earl Russell, had been asked twice by Queen Victoria to form a government, serving her as Prime Minister in the 1840s and 1860s. The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the peerage with the rise of the Tudor dynasty (see: Duke of Bedford). They established themselves as one of the leading British Whig families, and participated in every great political event from the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536–1540 to the Glorious Revolution in 1688–1689 and the Great Reform Act in 1832.\n\nLady Amberley was the daughter of Lord and Lady Stanley of Alderley. Russell often feared the ridicule of his maternal grandmother, one of the campaigners for education of women.\n\nRussell had two siblings: brother Frank (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and sister Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of diphtheria, followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of bronchitis following a long period of depression. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly Victorian paternal grandparents, who lived at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park. His grandfather, former Prime Minister Earl Russell, died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the Countess Russell (née Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.\n\nThe countess was from a Scottish Presbyterian family, and successfully petitioned the Court of Chancery to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting Darwinism and supporting Irish Home Rule), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on social justice and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. (One could challenge the view that Bertrand stood up for his principles, based on his own well-known quotation: \"I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong\".) Her favourite Bible verse, \"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil\" (Exodus 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression, and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.\n\nRussell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics, and that only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide. He was educated at home by a series of tutors. When Russell was eleven years old, his brother Frank introduced him to the work of Euclid, which transformed his life.\n\nDuring these formative years he also discovered the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. In his autobiography, he writes: \"I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy\". Russell claimed that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of Christian religious dogma, which he found very unconvincing. At this age, he came to the conclusion that there is no free will and, two years later, that there is no life after death. Finally, at the age of 18, after reading Mill's \"Autobiography\", he abandoned the \"First Cause\" argument and became an atheist.\n\nHe traveled to the continent in 1890 with an American friend, Edward FitzGerald, and with FitzGerald's family he visited the Paris Exhibition of 1889 and was able to climb the Eiffel Tower soon after it was completed.\n\nRussell won a scholarship to read for the Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, and commenced his studies there in 1890, taking as coach Robert Rumsey Webb. He became acquainted with the younger George Edward Moore and came under the influence of Alfred North Whitehead, who recommended him to the Cambridge Apostles. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh Wrangler in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.\n\nRussell was 17 years old in the summer of 1889 when he met the family of Alys Pearsall Smith, an American Quaker five years older, who was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia. He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family – they knew him primarily as \"Lord John's grandson\" and enjoyed showing him off.\n\nHe soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her. She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage. A lengthy period of separation began in 1911 with Russell's affair with Lady Ottoline Morrell, and he and Alys finally divorced in 1921 to enable Russell to remarry.\n\nDuring his years of separation from Alys, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Morrell and the actress Lady Constance Malleson. Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with Vivienne Haigh-Wood, the English governess and writer, and first wife of T. S. Eliot.\n\nRussell began his published work in 1896 with \"German Social Democracy\", a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the London School of Economics. He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb.\n\nHe now started an intensive study of the foundations of mathematics at Trinity.\nIn 1898 he wrote \"An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry\" which discussed the Cayley–Klein metrics used for non-Euclidean geometry.\nHe attended the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in 1900 where he met Giuseppe Peano and Alessandro Padoa. The Italians had responded to Georg Cantor, making a science of set theory; they gave Russell their literature including the Formulario mathematico. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon Russell's paradox. In 1903 he published \"The Principles of Mathematics\", a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of logicism, that mathematics and logic are one and the same.\n\nAt the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a \"sort of mystic illumination\", after witnessing Whitehead's wife's acute suffering in an angina attack. \"I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty ... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the Buddha to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable\", Russell would later recall. \"At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person.\"\n\nIn 1905 he wrote the essay \"On Denoting\", which was published in the philosophical journal \"Mind\". Russell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908. The three-volume \"Principia Mathematica\", written with Whitehead, was published between 1910 and 1913. This, along with the earlier \"The Principles of Mathematics\", soon made Russell world-famous in his field.\n\nIn 1910 he became a University of Cambridge lecturer at Trinity College where he studied. He was considered for a Fellowship, which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions, but was passed over because he was \"anti-clerical\", essentially because he was agnostic. He was approached by the Austrian engineering student Ludwig Wittgenstein, who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various phobias and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" in 1922. Russell delivered his lectures on Logical Atomism, his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of World War I. Wittgenstein was, at that time, serving in the Austrian Army and subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp at the end of the conflict.\n\nDuring World War I, Russell was one of the few people to engage in active pacifist activities and in 1916, because of his lack of a Fellowship, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914. He later described this as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression, in Free Thought and Official Propaganda. Russell played a significant part in the \"Leeds Convention\" in June 1917, a historic event which saw well over a thousand \"anti-war socialists\" gather; many being delegates from the Independent Labour Party and the Socialist Party, united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement. The international press reported that Russell appeared with a number of Labour MPs, including Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden, as well as former Liberal MP and anti-conscription campaigner, Professor Arnold Lupton. After the event, Russell told Lady Ottoline Morrell that, \"to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody\".\n\nThe Trinity incident resulted in Russell being fined £100, which he refused to pay in hope that he would be sent to prison, but his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the King James Bible that was stamped \"Confiscated by Cambridge Police\".\n\nA later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the US to enter the war on the United Kingdom's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in Brixton prison (see \"Bertrand Russell's views on society\") in 1918. He later said of his imprisonment:\n\nRussell was reinstated to Trinity in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer 1926 and became a Fellow again in 1944 until 1949.\n\nIn 1924, Bertrand again gained press attention when attending a \"banquet\" in the House of Commons with well-known campaigners, including Arnold Lupton, who had been a Member of Parliament and had also endured imprisonment for \"passive resistance to military or naval service\".\n\nIn 1941, G. H. Hardy wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled \"Bertrand Russell and Trinity\" – published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by C. D. Broad – in which he gave an authoritative account about Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.\n\nThe reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an \"unusual application\" and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered due to Russell's resignation since the ‘world of learning’ knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the \"Tarner Lectures\" on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best received books according to Hardy: \"The Analysis of Matter\", published in 1927. In the preface to the Trinity pamphlet, Hardy wrote:\n\nIn August 1920, Russell travelled to Russia as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the Russian Revolution. He wrote a four-part series of articles, titled \"Soviet Russia1920\", for the US magazine \"The Nation\". He met Vladimir Lenin and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin disappointing, sensing an \"impish cruelty\" in him and comparing him to \"an opinionated professor\". He cruised down the Volga on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He wrote a book \"The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism\" about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from the UK, all of whom came home thinking well of the régime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.\nRussell's lover Dora Black, a British author, feminist and socialist campaigner, visited Russia independently at the same time; in contrast to his reaction, she was enthusiastic about the revolution.\n\nThe following autumn Russell, accompanied by Dora, visited Peking (as it was then known in the West) to lecture on philosophy for a year. He went with optimism and hope, seeing China as then being on a new path. Other scholars present in China at the time included John Dewey and Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian Nobel-laureate poet. Before leaving China, Russell became gravely ill with pneumonia, and incorrect reports of his death were published in the Japanese press. When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading \"Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists\". Apparently they found this harsh and reacted resentfully.\n\nDora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to England on 26 August 1921. Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised, on 27 September 1921. Russell's children with Dora were John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell, born on 16 November 1921, and Katharine Jane Russell (now Lady Katharine Tait), born on 29 December 1923. Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of physics, ethics, and education to the layman.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1927 the Russells divided their time between London and Cornwall, spending summers in Porthcurno. In the 1922 and 1923 general elections Russell stood as a Labour Party candidate in the Chelsea constituency, but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe Conservative seat, and he was not on either occasion.\n\nTogether with Dora, Russell founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near Harting, West Sussex. On 8 July 1930 Dora gave birth to her third child Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.\n\nOn a tour through the US in 1927 Russell met Barry Fox (later Barry Stevens) who became a well-known Gestalt therapist and writer in later years. Russell and Fox developed an intensive relationship. In Fox's words: \"... for three years we were very close.\" Fox sent her daughter Judith to Beacon Hill School for some time. From 1927 to 1932 Russell wrote 34 letters to Fox.\n\nUpon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell.\n\nRussell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry. They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an Oxford undergraduate named Patricia (\"Peter\") Spence, who had been his children's governess since 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell, 5th Earl Russell, who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the Liberal Democrat party.\n\nRussell returned to the London School of Economics to lecture on the science of power in 1937.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Russell became a close friend and collaborator of V. K. Krishna Menon, then secretary of the India League, the foremost lobby in the United Kingdom for Indian self-rule.\n\nRussell opposed rearmament against Nazi Germany. In 1937 he wrote in a personal letter: \"If the Germans succeed in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister.\" In 1940, he changed his view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare: \"War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils.\"\n\nBefore World War II, Russell taught at the University of Chicago, later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the UCLA Department of Philosophy. He was appointed professor at the City College of New York (CCNY) in 1940, but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him \"morally unfit\" to teach at the college due to his opinions, especially those relating to sexual morality, detailed in \"Marriage and Morals\" (1929). The matter was however taken to the New York Supreme Court by Jean Kay who was afraid that her daughter would be harmed by the appointment, though her daughter was not a student at CCNY. Many intellectuals, led by John Dewey, protested at his treatment. Albert Einstein's oft-quoted aphorism that \"great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds\" originated in his open letter, dated 19 March 1940, to Morris Raphael Cohen, a professor emeritus at CCNY, supporting Russell's appointment. Dewey and Horace M. Kallen edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in \"The Bertrand Russell Case\". Russell soon joined the Barnes Foundation, lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of \"A History of Western Philosophy\". His relationship with the eccentric Albert C. Barnes soon soured, and he returned to the UK in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College.\n\nRussell participated in many broadcasts over the BBC, particularly \"The Brains Trust\" and the Third Programme, on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was world-famous outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in Trondheim, Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) of an aeroplane crash in Hommelvik in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane. \"A History of Western Philosophy\" (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1942 Russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism, capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles, in an inquiry on dialectical materialism, launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher Wolfgang Paalen in his journal \"DYN\", saying \"I think the metaphysics of both Hegel and Marx plain nonsense – Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than Mary Baker Eddy's. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism.\"\n\nIn 1943, Russell expressed support for Zionism: \"I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to Jews to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture\".\n\nIn a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the USSR's aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an atomic bomb than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides. At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in Eastern Europe which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a first strike in a war with the USSR, including Nigel Lawson, who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including Griffin, who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.\nHowever, just after the atomic bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the United States possessed them and before the USSR did. In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practiced in the Soviet Union. After it became known that the USSR carried out its nuclear bomb tests, Russell declared his position advocating for the total abolition of atomic weapons.\n\nIn 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural Reith Lectures—what was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC. His series of six broadcasts, titled \"Authority and the Individual\", explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society. Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to \"Words and Things\" by Ernest Gellner, which was highly critical of the later thought of Ludwig Wittgenstein and of ordinary language philosophy. Gilbert Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal \"Mind\", which caused Russell to respond via \"The Times\". The result was a month-long correspondence in \"The Times\" between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy. \n\nIn the King's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the Order of Merit, and the following year he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. When he was given the Order of Merit, George VI was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying, \"You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted\". Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply \"That's right, just like your brother\" immediately came to mind. In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother).\n\nIn 1950, Russell attended the inaugural conference for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, a C.I.A.-funded anti-communist organization committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the Cold War. Russell was one of the best known patrons of the Congress, until he resigned in 1956\n\nRussell married his fourth wife, Edith Finch, soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend Lucy Donnelly. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from serious mental illness, which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.\n\nIn September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in Brixton Prison for \"breach of peace\" after taking part in an anti-nuclear demonstration in London. The magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to \"good behaviour\", to which Russell replied: \"No, I won't.\"\n\nIn 1962 Russell played a public role in the Cuban Missile Crisis: in an exchange of telegrams with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless. Russell sent this telegram to President Kennedy:\n\nYOUR ACTION DESPERATE. THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL. NO CONCEIVABLE JUSTIFICATION. CIVILIZED MAN CONDEMNS IT. WE WILL NOT HAVE MASS MURDER. ULTIMATUM MEANS WAR... END THIS MADNESS.\n\nAccording to historian Peter Knight, after JFK's assassination, Russell, \"prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer Mark Lane in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a Who Killed Kennedy Committee in June 1964, members of which included Michael Foot MP, Caroline Benn, the publisher Victor Gollancz, the writers John Arden and J. B. Priestley, and the Oxford history professor Hugh Trevor-Roper.\" Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the Warren Commission Report was published, setting forth \"16 Questions on the Assassination\" and equating the Oswald case with the Dreyfus affair of late 19th-century France, in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticised the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.\n\nBertrand Russell was opposed to war from early on, his opposition to World War I being used as grounds for his dismissal from Trinity College at Cambridge. This incident fused two of his most controversial causes, as he had failed to be granted Fellow status, which would have protected him from firing, because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout Christian, or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic.\n\nHe later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression, citing the incident in Free Thought and Official Propaganda, where he explained that the expression of any idea, even the most obviously \"bad\", must be protected not only from direct State intervention, but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced:\n\nRussell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to nuclear disarmament and opposing the Vietnam War. The 1955 Russell–Einstein Manifesto was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time. In 1966–1967, Russell worked with Jean-Paul Sartre and many other intellectual figures to form the Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam. He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period.\n\nIn 1956, immediately before and during the Suez Crisis, Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the Suez Canal area \"where general interest is involved\". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the Hungarian Revolution and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets \"because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating\". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which Michael Polanyi had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest.\n\nIn November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, urging a summit to consider \"the conditions of co-existence\". Khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in \"The Observer\", proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany \"freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West\". US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as \"The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles\".\n\nRussell was asked by \"The New Republic\", a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all hydrogen bombs, with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the Oder-Neisse line as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing Arab nationalism, and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard Israel's frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the People's Republic of China, and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.\n\nHe was in contact with Lionel Rogosin while the latter was filming his anti-war film \"Good Times, Wonderful Times\" in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the New Left. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the Vietnam War, and felt that the US government's policies there were near-genocidal. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the Jerusalem Prize, an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society. In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to Israel and the Arab countries to accept an arms embargo and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry. In October 1965 he tore up his Labour Party card because he suspected Harold Wilson's Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.\n\nIn June 1955 Russell had leased Plas Penrhyn in Penrhyndeudraeth, Merionethshire, Wales and on 5 July of the following year it became his and Edith's principal residence.\nRussell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Russell made a cameo appearance playing himself in the anti-war Hindi film \"Aman\", by Mohan Kumar, which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.\n\nOn 23 November 1969 he wrote to \"The Times\" newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in Czechoslovakia was \"highly alarming\". The same month, he appealed to Secretary General U Thant of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The following month, he protested to Alexei Kosygin over the expulsion of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn from the Soviet Union of Writers.\n\nOn 31 January 1970 Russell issued a statement condemning \"Israel's aggression in the Middle East\", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the War of Attrition. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-Six-Day War borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in Cairo on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.\n\nRussell died of influenza on 2 February 1970 at his home in Penrhyndeudraeth. His body was cremated in Colwyn Bay on 5 February 1970. In accordance with his will, there was no religious ceremony; his ashes were scattered over the Welsh mountains later that year. He left an estate valued at £69,423 (£1.09 million or US$1.4 million in 2018 money).\nIn 1980 a memorial to Russell was commissioned by a committee including the philosopher A. J. Ayer. It consists of a bust of Russell in Red Lion Square in London sculpted by Marcelle Quinton.\n\nRussell held throughout his life the following styles and honours:\n\nRussell is generally credited with being one of the founders of analytic philosophy. He was deeply impressed by Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except aesthetics. He was particularly prolific in the field of metaphysics, the logic and the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of language, ethics and epistemology. When Brand Blanshard asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, \"but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects\".\n\nOn ethics, Russell considered himself a utilitarian.\n\nFor the advancement of science \"and\" protection of the right to freedom of expression, Russell advocated The Will to Doubt, the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:\n\nRussell described himself in 1947 as an agnostic, saying: \"Therefore, in regard to the Olympic gods, speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the Christian God, I should, I think, take exactly the same line.\" For most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than superstition and, in spite of any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the British Humanist Association and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death.\n\nPolitical and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes.\n\nRussell argued for a \"scientific society\", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared. He suggested the establishment of a \"single supreme world government\" able to enforce peace, claiming that \"the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation\".\n\nRussell was an active supporter of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, being one of the signatories of A. E. Dyson's 1958 letter to \"The Times\" calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.\n\nIn \"Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday\" (\"Postscript\" in his \"Autobiography\"), Russell wrote: \"I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken\".\n\nBelow is a selected bibliography of Russell's books in English, sorted by year of first publication:\n\nRussell was the author of more than sixty books and over two thousand articles. Additionally, he wrote many pamphlets, introductions, and letters to the editor. One pamphlet titled, \"'I Appeal unto Caesar': The Case of the Conscientious Objectors\", ghostwritten for Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist Stephen Hobhouse, allegedly helped secure the release from prison of hundreds of conscientious objectors.\n\nHis works can be found in anthologies and collections, including \"The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell\", which McMaster University began publishing in 1983. By March 2017 this collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works included 18 volumes, and several more are in progress.

From his parents and neighbors, mostly former residents of small towns and villages who had moved to larger cities after the Holocaust, he learned the native folk traditions of Jewish Bessarabia along with its rich Yiddish dialect. \n\nSandler began studying music at the age of five, eventually enrolling in a music conservatory. He worked as a professional violinist for a decade, including seven years playing with the Moldovan State Orchestra. He took a two-year hiatus from his musical career, however, in order to study literature as part of a group of Yiddish and other minority-language writers who attended the Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow for graduate studies. There in 1981 Sandler was among the first cohort of Yiddish writers and poets to study Yiddish literature at the graduate level in the USSR since Stalin's purge of Yiddish writers and educational institutions in the late 1940s. He made his literary debut that same year in the USSR's state-sponsored Yiddish literary journal Sovetish Heymland, where he would later serve on the journal's editorial board. His first collection of short fiction, \"Stairway to a Miracle\", was published in 1986. \n\nIn 1989 Sandler became the host and lead producer of the first regularly-appearing Yiddish-language television show \"On the Jewish Street,\" which aired for several years on Moldovan television. During this period Sandler created two Yiddish-language documentary films, \"Where is My Home\" and \"Don't Give Up Yiddish!\" about Moldovan Jewish life. Sensing that most of the community would soon leave for Israel, he used the documentaries as a way to preserve the memories of Bessarabian Jewry at a time of great upheaval. From 1990 until 1992 Sandler was also the editor of the Yiddish section of the Chișinău-based newspaper \"Our Voice\". \n\nSandler moved to Israel in 1992, where he soon became active in the local community of Yiddish writers and journalists, contributing articles to the Yiddish press, working in a publishing house and at Hebrew University where he assisted in the cataloging of interwar Yiddish periodicals. In addition to his work as the executive director of Leivick House Publishing, Sandler published a children's magazine \"Kind un Keyt.\" During this period three of Sandler's books appeared in Israel; the novella \"Case Number 5390\" (1992) and the short story collections \"The Old Well\" (1994) and \"Gates\" (1997).\n\nIn 1998 Sandler moved to New York to begin working at the Yiddish edition of The Forward. After the unexpected death of editor-in-chief Mordechai Strigler several months later Sandler took over the newspaper, adding an international lineup of new contributors and training two generations of new Yiddish journalists. Sandler also expanded The Forward's literary offerings, publishing new works by esteemed writers of the older generation including Abraham Karpinowitz,Yekhiel Shraybman, Zvi Eisenmann, Misha Lev, Rivka Basman Ben-Hayim, Tsvi Kanar, Moyshe Shklar, Yente Mash, Chaim Beider and younger writers such as Mikhoel Felsenbaum, Boris Kotlerman, Moishe Lemster, Emil Kalin and Evgeny Kissin. Additionally, Sandler oversaw the production of several thousand hours of The Forward's weekly Yiddish radio show, and produced a dozen CDs of Yiddish music and audio books, which were released under the aegis of The Forward. During this period several of Sandler's novels appeared as serials in the paper. \n\nBesides his work as a writer and editor Sandler also produced a series of twelve documentary films about the lives of Yiddish writers. Most of these films, released between 2009 and 2016, were based on interviews conducted in the late 1990s, when the last generation of Yiddish writers who came of age before World War II were still active in Israel. Additionally he oversaw the launch of the newspaper's Youtube channel. \n\nSandler retired from the Yiddish Forward in 2016 after 18 years as editor-in-chief. He continues to publish his own fiction as well as the works of others in the online publication Yidish Branzhe, which he founded and edits. \n\nWhile most of Sandler's fiction takes place in the post-war Bessarabia of his youth his subject matter ranges from historical novels about the Kishenev Pogrom and novellas about the Holocaust to portrayals of immigrant Jewish life in Israel and New York and even occasional science fiction. In addition to strong influences from classic Yiddish writers such as Sholem Aleichem and modernist Yiddish writers such as David Bergelson Sandler's fiction often incorporates elements of Magic realism. Among Sandler's frequent themes are intergenerational trauma resulting from the Holocaust, the effect of totalitarian political regimes on the lives of artists and writers, the fate of Yiddish language and culture in the 21st century and the impact of immigration on multigenerational families.\n\nSandler has also written a series of Yiddish children's stories based on Jewish folktales as well as the collection of rhyming couplets ניט געשטויגן, ניט געפֿלויגן (roughly: \"It Didn't Happen that Way.\") \n\nBoris Sandler has received nearly every Yiddish literary prize that was still being awarded in the 1990s and 2000s including the Jacob Fichman Prize (2002), the Dovid Hofshtein Prize awarded by the Yiddish Writer’s Union in Israel (2005) and the J. I. Segal Prize from the Jewish Public Library of Montreal for the best new work of Yiddish literature (2010 and 2014).\n\nAdditionally Sandler's short film on the history of the Forward building received an Ippies award from the Center for Community and Ethnic Media at CUNY.\n\n\"Stairway to a Miracle\" (Yiddish: Moscow, Sovietsky Pisatel Publishers, 1986) \n\n\"Stairway to a Miracle\" (Russian translation: Moscow, Sovietsky Pisatel Publishers, 1988) \n\n\"Case Number 5390\" (Yiddish: Jerusalem, Y.

She was a member of the Félibrige, a society that tried to preserve the language and its literature.\n\nAlexandrine Élisabeth Brémond was born in Tarascon, Bouches-du-Rhône, on 28 October 1858.\nHer parents were Alexandre Brémond and Henriette Reynier.\nThey owned and cultivated a farm in Trébon, near Arles, and soon after her birth acquired the Darbousille farm at Fontvieille, Bouches-du-Rhône, also near Arles.\nShe grew up in modest circumstances.\nAlexandrine began writing poetry in Provencal under the pseudonym \"Brémonde de Tarascon\", or \"Bremoundo de Tarascouno\" in Provençal, and would become one of the best known Provençal poets of her day.\n\nIn 1885 Brémonde de Tarascon was awarded the prize for poetry at the Grand Jo Flourau dou Felibrige (Great Floral Games of the Félibrige).\nThe Grands Jeux Floraux have been held every seven years since 1878 by the Félibrige to reward the best writers in the Occitan language.\nThe grand prize winner has the honor of choosing the Queen of the Félibrige, an honorary title that will be held for the next seven years.\nBrémonde de Tarascon chose Thérèse Roumanille, wife of Jules Boissière.\nOn 25 November 1886 Alexandrine married the lawyer Joseph Gautier, who also wrote poetry.\nA few years later her parents divorced.\nAlexandrine gave birth to a daughter, Marthe Gautier, in 1894. \nMarthe later became a police medical inspector in Paris.\nAlexandrine died of acute bronchitis on 22 June 1898 at the Darboussille farmhouse, aged 40.\nHer eulogy was pronounced by the poet Charloun Rieu.\nThe town of Tarascon has given her name to one of its squares and erected a bust of the poetess.\nThe bust, by sculptor Camille Soccorsi, was inaugurated on 2 May 1965.\n\nFrédéric Mistral (neveu) said Alexandrine Élisabeth Brémond was the most lyrical of the Provencal poets, and saw her as the literary sister of Théodore Aubanel.\nHer first work to appear in print was \"Li Blavet de Mount-Majour\" (The Blueberries of Montmajour, 1883).\nThe poems celebrate flowers, pretty girls at the window, spring, laughter, the breeze in the trees and a serene song of young love, joy and hope.\nIn \"Velo blanco\" (\"White Veil\"), which appeared in 1887, a girl who is bold and timid, who laughs and cries, sings her hopes; a woman speaks her love.\nThe superb \"L'Amazone\" was included in the second volume of the \"Anthologie du Félibrige Provençal\", edited by Charles Pierre Julian and Pierre Fontan.\n\nAlexandrine's next work, published five years later, was \"Brut de canèu\" (\"Sound of reeds\").\nFrédéric Mistral wrote the preface.\nThe collection is a second return to her childhood, the great plains of the Trébon of Arles where she saw her father's laborers tracing their furrows as far as the eye could see towards Montmajour, whose towers exalt the glory of God, towards the banks of the Vigueirat Marshes where she saw the fish spawn and the water lilies bloom, and towards the farmhouse at Darbousille where she gazed at the stars in the long summer evenings.\nThree poems are exceptional: \"Le maître d’aire\"; \"Aubanel\", in honour of the great lyric poet; and \"Pluie d’étoiles\" (\"Rain of Stars\"), describing a flock of stars that turn into women as they touch the ground, the muses, dreamers and singers of all the ages.\n\n\"Lou debanaire flouri\" (The Flowery Reel) with a preface by Paul Arène, was not published until 1908, ten years after her death. \nIt was a collection of poems that had appeared in various publications during her life.\nOne, in verses that leap like bulls, tells the legend of the Bulls of Peter. It is perhaps the best known.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3206290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3206290", "title": "Check-in", "text": "Check-in\n\nCheck-in is the process whereby people announce their arrival at a hotel, airport, seaport, or event.\n\nThe check-in process at airports enables passengers to check in luggage onto a plane and to obtain a boarding pass. When presenting at the check-in counter, a passenger will provide evidence of the right to travel, such as a ticket, visa or electronic means. Each airline provides facilities for passengers to check in their luggage, except for their carry-on bags. This may be by way of airline-employed staff at check-in counters at airports or through an agency arrangement or by way of a self-service kiosk. The luggage is weighed and tagged, and then placed on a conveyor that usually feeds the luggage into the main baggage handling system. The luggage goes into the aircraft's cargo hold. The check-in staff then issues each passenger with a boarding pass.\n\nThere is an increasing trend towards more streamlined checking-in processes, whereby passengers can bypass or reduce the time in queues at the staffed check-in counters. This may involve passengers checking in online before arriving at the airport or using an airline's self-service check-in kiosks at the airport. Some airports have a curbside check-in, where passengers can check in their bags to an airline representative before entering the terminal and then proceeding directly to security.\n\nMany airlines have a deadline for passengers to check-in before each flight. This is to allow the airline to offer unclaimed seats to stand-by passengers, to load luggage onto the plane and to finalize documentation for take-off. The passenger must also take into account the time that would be required for them to clear the check-in line, to pass security and then to walk (sometimes also to ride) from the check-in area to the boarding area. This may take several hours at some airports or at some times of the year. On international flights, additional time would be required for immigration and customs clearance.\n\nAt hotels or similar establishments, guests are usually required to check in (also called register or sign-in), which involves providing or confirming the guests' personal information and providing a signature. The laws of some countries require guests to sign a register (or a registration card) and some also require the provision of identification documents, such as a passport or drivers licence which the hotel can copy and retain for its records. Usually, only one guest per room is required to register. Sometimes, the register may need to be provided to a government agency, such as members of the police, sometimes with a court warrant or similar authority.\n\nThe establishment may require guests to provide a credit card guarantee to cover potential costs such as room service or mini-bar for the duration of the stay and to enable an express check-out at the end of the stay. At the end of the check-in, the reception staff will provide guests with a room key.\n\nCheck-in times vary but this can range from 12 pm until about 3 pm depending on the establishment's rules and regulations. Late check-ins can be arranged through the hotel as long as the guests book this in advance and arrange all the necessary details. Hotels usually specify a check-in time after which they expect guests to check-in. If a guest wants to occupy a hotel room before the hotel's check-in time, some hotels charge for an additional day or treat it as a previous day's stay (as compared to occupying the hotel room after the check-in time). Most hotels, however, allow a grace time (typically 30–60 minutes) on request by a guest, without any additional charge, if a guest wishes to take the room before the check-in time. Some hotels also have a latest check-in time, often 6 pm-8 pm, after which they may give a room to someone else if the room is not prepaid or the guest does not phone in to indicate a time of arrival. Some hotels have a deadline for checking-in because the reception may close for the night. For the most cost-effective usage of hotel room occupancy, a guest should try to arrive at about hotel's check-in time and leave or hand over the hotel room at about the hotel's check-out time, but it may not be always practical because the guest's arrival and departure time of flights or car trips may not align with the hotel check-in and check-out time and for other reasons.\n\nMany social networking services, such as Foursquare, Google Latitude (closed), Google+, Facebook, Jiepang, VK, Gowalla (closed), GetGlue and Brightkite (closed), allow users to what has been referred to as self-reported positioning, or more commonly known as a \"check-in\", to a physical place and share their locations with their friends.\n\nUsers can check into a specific location by text messaging or by using a mobile application on a smartphone—the application will use the phone's GPS to find the current location.\n\nMany applications have a “Places” button or tab where a user can see a list of nearby places into which the user can check in. If a location is not on the nearby places list, the user can add the location directly from the phone. Once users have checked in, they have the option of sharing their location with friends in services such as Twitter or Facebook.\n\nSince the check-in became a ubiquitous mechanism in most mobile applications, the industry especially in the gaming branch, has tried to find alternatives. Gaming applications ,in particular, require the user to check in multiple times in a row, so the mechanism becomes a sustained routine. Currently, possibilities for an auto-check-in are tested by developers.\n"}
{"id": "46953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46953", "title": "Chroma key", "text": "Chroma key\n\nChroma key compositing, or chroma keying, is a visual effects/post-production technique for compositing (layering) two images or video streams together based on color hues (chroma range). The technique has been used heavily in many fields to remove a background from the subject of a photo or video – particularly the newscasting, motion picture and videogame industries. A color range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The chroma keying technique is commonly used in video production and post-production. This technique is also referred to as color keying, colour-separation overlay (CSO; primarily by the BBC), or by various terms for specific color-related variants such as green screen, and blue screen – chroma keying can be done with backgrounds of any color that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used because they differ most distinctly in hue from most human skin colors. No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the color used as the backing.\n\nIt is commonly used for weather forecast broadcasts, wherein a news presenter is usually seen standing in front of a large CGI map during live television newscasts, though in actuality it is a large blue or green background. When using a blue screen, different weather maps are added on the parts of the image where the color is blue. If the news presenter wears blue clothes, his or her clothes will also be replaced with the background video. Chroma keying is also common in the entertainment industry for visual effects in movies and video games.\n\nPrior to the introduction of travelling mattes and optical printing, double exposure was used to introduce elements into a scene which were not present in the initial exposure. This was done using black draping where a green screen would be used today. George Albert Smith first used this approach in 1898. In 1903, \"The Great Train Robbery\" by Edwin S. Porter used double exposure to add background scenes to windows which were black when filmed on set, using a garbage matte to expose only the window areas.\n\nIn order to have figures in one exposure actually move in front of a substituted background in the other, a travelling matte was needed, to occlude the correct portion of the background in each frame. In 1918 Frank Williams patented a travelling matte technique, again based on using a black background. This was used in many films, such as \"The Invisible Man\".\n\nIn the 1920s, Walt Disney used a white backdrop to include human actors with cartoon characters and backgrounds in his \"Alice Comedies\".\n\nThe blue screen method was developed in the 1930s at RKO Radio Pictures. At RKO, Linwood Dunn used an early version of the travelling matte to create \"wipes\" – where there were transitions like a windshield wiper in films such as \"Flying Down to Rio\" (1933). Credited to Larry Butler, a scene featuring a genie escaping from a bottle was the first use of a proper bluescreen process to create a traveling matte for \"The Thief of Bagdad\" (1940), which won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects that year. In 1950, Warner Brothers employee and ex-Kodak researcher Arthur Widmer began working on an ultraviolet travelling matte process. He also began developing bluescreen techniques: one of the first films to use them was the 1958 adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway novella, \"The Old Man and the Sea\", starring Spencer Tracy.\n\nPetro Vlahos was awarded an Academy Award for his refinement of these techniques in 1964. His technique exploits the fact that most objects in real-world scenes have a color whose blue-color component is similar in intensity to their green-color component. Zbigniew Rybczyński also contributed to bluescreen technology. An optical printer with two projectors, a film camera and a 'beam splitter', was used to combine the actor in front of a blue screen together with the background footage, one frame at a time. In the early 1970s, American and British television networks began using green backdrops instead of blue for their newscasts. During the 1980s, minicomputers were used to control the optical printer. For the film \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Richard Edlund created a 'quad optical printer' that accelerated the process considerably and saved money. He received a special Academy Award for his innovation.\n\nFor decades, travelling matte shots had to be done \"locked-down\", so that neither the matted subject nor the background could shift their camera perspective at all. Later, computer-timed, motion-control cameras alleviated this problem, as both the foreground and background could be filmed with the same camera moves.\n\nMeteorologists on television often use a field monitor, to the side of the screen, to see where they are putting their hands against the background images. A newer technique is to project a faint image onto the screen.\n\nSome films make heavy use of chroma key to add backgrounds that are constructed entirely using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Performances from different takes can be composited together, which allows actors to be filmed separately and then placed together in the same scene. Chroma key allows performers to appear to be in any location without leaving the studio. \nComputer development also made it easier to incorporate motion into composited shots, even when using handheld cameras. Reference-points can be placed onto the colored background (usually as a painted grid, X's marked with tape, or equally spaced tennis balls attached to the wall). In post-production, a computer can use the references to compute the camera's position and thus render an image that matches the perspective and movement of the foreground perfectly. Modern advances in software and computational power have eliminated the need to accurately place the markers – the software figures out their position in space (a disadvantage of this is that it requires a large camera movement, possibly encouraging modern film techniques where the camera is always in motion).\n\nThe principal subject is filmed or photographed against a background consisting of a single colour or a relatively narrow range of colours, usually blue or green because these colours are considered to be the farthest away from skin tone. The portions of the video which match the pre-selected color are replaced by the alternate background video. This process is commonly known as \"keying\", \"keying out\" or simply a \"key\".\n\nGreen is used as a backdrop for TV and electronic cinematography more than any other colour because television weathermen tended to wear blue suits. When chroma keying first came into use in television production, the blue screen that was then the norm in the movie industry was used out of habit, until other practical considerations caused the television industry to move from blue to green screens. Broadcast quality color television cameras use separate red, green and blue image sensors, and early analog TV chroma keyers required RGB component video to work reliably. From a technological perspective it was equally possible to use the blue or green channel, but because blue clothing was an ongoing challenge, the green screen came into common use. Newscasters sometimes forget the chroma key dress code, and when the key is applied to clothing of the same color as the background, the person would seem to disappear into the key. Because green clothing is less common than blue, it soon became apparent that it was easier to use a green matte screen than it was to constantly police the clothing choices of on-air talent. Also, because the human eye is more sensitive to green wavelengths, which lie in the middle of the visible light spectrum, the green analog video channel typically carried more signal strength, giving a better signal to noise ratio compared to the other component video channels, so green screen keys could produce the cleanest key. In the digital television and cinema age, much of the tweaking that was required to make a good quality key has been automated. However, the one constant that remains is some level of color coordination to keep foreground subjects from being keyed out.\n\nBefore electronic chroma keying, compositing was done on (chemical) film. The camera colour negative was printed onto high-contrast black and white film, using either a filter or the colour sensitivity of the black and white film to limit it to the blue channel. Assuming this film was a negative it produced clear where the blue matte screen was, black elsewhere, except it also produced clear for any white objects (since they also contained blue). Removing these spots could be done by a suitable double-exposure with the colour positive, and many other techniques. The end result was a clear background with an opaque shape of the subject in the middle. This is called a \"female matte\", similar to an \"alpha matte\" in digital keying. Copying this film onto another high-contrast negative produced the opposite 'male matte'. The background negative was then packed with the female matte and exposed onto a final strip of film, then the camera negative was packed with the male matte was double-printed onto this same film. These two images combined together creates the final effect.\n\nThe most important factor for a key is the colour separation of the foreground (the subject) and background (the screen) – a blue screen will be used if the subject is predominately green (for example plants), despite the camera being more sensitive to green light.\n\nIn analog colour TV, colour is represented by the phase of the chroma subcarrier relative to a reference oscillator. Chroma key is achieved by comparing the phase of the video to the phase corresponding to the pre-selected color. In-phase portions of the video are replaced by the alternate background video.\n\nIn digital colour TV, colour is represented by three numbers (red, green, blue intensity levels). Chroma key is achieved by a simple numerical comparison between the video and the pre-selected color. If the color at a particular point on the screen matches (either exactly, or in a range), then the video at that point is replaced by the alternate background.\n\nIn order to create an illusion that characters and objects filmed are present in the intended background scene, the lighting in the two scenes must be a reasonable match. For outdoor scenes, overcast days create a diffuse, evenly colored light which can be easier to match in the studio, whereas direct sunlight needs to be matched in both direction and overall color based on time of day.\n\nA studio shot taken in front of a green screen will naturally have ambient light the same color as the screen, due to its light scattering. This effect is known as \"spill\". This can look unnatural or cause portions of the characters to disappear, so must be compensated for, or avoided by using a larger screen placed far from the actors.\n\nThe depth of field used to record the scene in front of the coloured screen should match that of the background. This can mean recording the actors with a larger depth of field than normal.\n\nA chroma key subject must avoid wearing clothes which are similar in color to the chroma key color(s) (unless intentional e.g., wearing a green top to make it appear that the subject has no body), because the clothing may be replaced with the background image/video. An example of intentional use of this is when an actor wears a blue covering over a part of his body to make it invisible in the final shot. This technique can be used to achieve an effect similar to that used in the \"Harry Potter\" films to create the effect of an invisibility cloak. The actor can also be filmed against a chroma-key background and inserted into the background shot with a distortion effect, in order to create a cloak that is marginally detectable.\n\nDifficulties emerge with blue screen when a costume in an effects shot must be blue, such as Superman's traditional blue outfit. In the 2002 film \"Spider-Man\", in scenes where both Spider-Man and the Green Goblin are in the air, Spider-Man had to be shot in front of the green screen and the Green Goblin had to be shot in front of a blue screen. The color difference is because Spider-Man wears a costume which is red and blue in color and the Green Goblin wears a costume which is entirely green in color. If both were shot in front of the same screen, parts of one character would be erased from the shot.\n\nFor a clean division of foreground from background, it is also important that clothing and hair in the foreground shot have a fairly simple silhouette, as fine details such as frizzy hair may not resolve properly. Similarly, partially transparent elements of the costume cause problems.\n\nBlue was originally used for TV chroma keying special effects because human skin tone contains very little blue, and because the film industry used blue backgrounds for similar purposes. The color blue was tied to the blue emulsion layer of film having comparable grain and detail in comparison to the red and green layers of the emulsion. In television and digital filmmaking, however, green has become the favored color because of some practical considerations, and because lossy compression algorithms used in both analog and digital TV distribution retain more detail in the green channel. The choice of color is up to the effects artists and the needs of the specific shot. Whereas the blue screen was introduced to the television industry by the film industry, the use of green screen visual effects has been introduced to the film industry as electronic imaging has augmented and replaced the use of chemical film stock in cinema. Also, the green background is favored over blue for outdoor filming where the blue sky might appear in the frame and could accidentally be replaced in the process. Although green and blue are the most common in part because red, green and blue components are used to encode the visible light spectrum, any key color can be used. Red is avoided for human subjects due to its prevalence in white skin tones, but can be often used for objects and scenes which do not involve people.\n\nSo-called \"yellow screen\" is accomplished with a white backdrop. Ordinary stage lighting is used in combination with a bright yellow sodium lamp. The sodium light falls almost entirely in a narrow frequency band, which can then be separated from the other light using a prism, and projected onto a separate but synchronized film carrier within the camera. This second film is high-contrast black and white, and is processed to produce the matte.\n\nOccasionally, a magenta background is used, as in some software applications where the magenta or fuchsia is sometimes referred to as \"magic pink\".\n\nA newer technique is to use a retroreflective curtain in the background, along with a ring of bright LEDs around the camera lens. This requires no light to shine on the background other than the LEDs, which use an extremely small amount of power and space unlike big stage lights, and require no rigging. This advance was made possible by the invention in the 1990s of practical blue LEDs, which also allow for emerald green LEDs.\n\nThere is also a form of color keying that uses light spectrum invisible to human eye. Called Thermo-Key, it uses infrared as the key color, which would not be replaced by background image during postprocessing.\n\nFor \"\", an ultraviolet light matting process was proposed by Don Lee of CIS Hollywood and developed by Gary Hutzel and the staff of Image G. This involved a fluorescent orange backdrop which made it easier to generate a holdout matte, thus allowing the effects team to produce effects in a quarter of the time needed for other methods.\n\nIn principle, any type of still background can be used as a chroma key instead of a solid color. First the background is captured without actors or other foreground elements; then the scene is recorded. The image of the background is used to cancel the background in the actual footage; for example in a digital image, each pixel will have a different chroma key. This is sometimes referred to as a \"difference matte\". However, this makes it easy for objects to be accidentally removed if they happen to be similar to the background, or for the background to remain due to camera noise or if it happens to change slightly from the reference footage. A background with a repeating pattern alleviates many of these issues, and can be less sensitive to wardrobe color than solid-color backdrops.\n\nThe biggest challenge when setting up a bluescreen or greenscreen is even lighting and the avoidance of shadow, because it is best to have as narrow a color range as possible being replaced. A shadow would present itself as a darker color to the camera and might not register for replacement. This can sometimes be seen in low-budget or live broadcasts where the errors cannot be manually repaired. The material being used affects the quality and ease of having it evenly lit. Materials which are shiny will be far less successful than those that are not. A shiny surface will have areas that reflect the lights making them appear pale, while other areas may be darkened. A matte surface will diffuse the reflected light and have a more even color range. In order to get the cleanest key from shooting greenscreen it is necessary to create a value difference between the subject and the greenscreen. In order to differentiate the subject from the screen, a two-stop difference can be used, either by making the greenscreen two stops higher than the subject, or vice versa.\n\nSometimes a shadow can be used to create a visual effect. Areas of the bluescreen or greenscreen with a shadow on them can be replaced with a darker version of the desired background video image, making it look like the person is casting a shadow on them. Any spill of the chroma key color will make the result look unnatural. A difference in the focal length of the lenses used can affect the success of chroma key.\n\nAnother challenge for bluescreen or greenscreen is proper camera exposure. Underexposing or overexposing a colored backdrop can lead to poor saturation levels. In the case of video cameras, underexposed images can contain high amounts of noise, as well. The background must be bright enough to allow the camera to create a bright and saturated image.\n\nThere are several different quality- and speed-optimized techniques for implementing color keying in software.\n\nIn most versions, a function \"f\"(\"r\", \"g\", \"b\") → \"α\" is applied to every pixel in the image. α (alpha) has a meaning similar to that in alpha compositing techniques. \"α\" ≤ 0 means the pixel is fully in the green screen, \"α\" ≥ 1 means the pixel is fully in the foreground object, and intermediate values indicate the pixel is partially covered by the foreground object (or it is transparent). A further function \"g\"(\"r\", \"g\", \"b\") → (\"r\", \"g\", \"b\") is needed to remove green spill on the foreground objects.\n\nA very simple \"f\"() function for green screen is \"A\"(\"r\"+\"b\") − \"Bg\" where \"A\" and \"B\" are user adjustable constants with a default value of 1.0. A very simple \"g\"() is (\"r\", min(\"g\",\"b\"), \"b\"). This is fairly close to the capabilities of analog and film-based screen pulling.\n\nModern examples of these functions are best described by two closed nested surfaces in the 3-D rgb space, often quite complex. Colors inside the inner surface are considered green screen. Colors outside the outer surface are opaque foreground. Colors between the surfaces are partially covered, they are more opaque the closer they are to the outer surface. Sometimes more closed surfaces are used to determine how to remove green spill. It is also very common for \"f\"() to depend on more than just the current pixel's color, it may also use the (\"x\", \"y\") position, the values of nearby pixels, the value from reference images or a statistical color model of the scene, and values from user-drawn masks. These produce closed surfaces in a space with more than three dimensions.\n\nA different class of algorithm tries to figure out a 2D path that separates the foreground from the background. This path can be the output, or the image can be drawn by filling the path with \"α\" = 1 as a final step. An example of such an algorithm is the use of active contour. Most research in recent years has been into these algorithms.\n\n\n\n"}

These are then processed using a Non-photorealistic rendering technique in order to generate graphical icons.\n\nDeveloper Don Park introduced the identicon library for making a visual icon from a hash\nof a data identifier.

Paul Erdős established in 1970 that the conjecture holds if there exists a constant formula_8 such that for every integer formula_9 we have either formula_10 or formula_11.

Its main use is to convert a multi-level image into a binary image, though it has other applications.\n\nUnlike many other halftoning methods, error diffusion is classified as an area operation, because what the algorithm does at one location influences what happens at other locations. This means buffering is required, and complicates parallel processing. Point operations, such as ordered dither, do not have these complications.\n\nError diffusion has the tendency to enhance edges in an image. This can make text in images more readable than in other halftoning techniques.\n\nRichard Howland Ranger received United States patent 1790723 for his invention, \"Facsimile system.\" The patent, which issued in 1931, describes a system for transmitting images over telephone or telegraph lines, or by radio. Ranger's invention permitted continuous tone photographs to be converted first into black and white, then transmitted to remote locations, which had a pen moving over a piece of paper. To render black, the pen was lowered to the paper; to produce white, the pen was raised. Shades of gray were rendered by intermittently raising and lowering the pen, depending upon the luminance of the gray desired.\n\nRanger's invention used capacitors to store charges, and vacuum tube comparators to determine when the present luminance, plus any accumulated error, was above a threshold (causing the pen to be raised) or below (causing the pen to be lowered). In this sense, it was an analog version of error diffusion.\n\nFloyd and Steinberg described a system for performing error diffusion on digital images based on a simple kernel:\n\nwhere \"formula_2\" denotes a pixel in the current row which has already been processed (hence diffusing error to it would be pointless), and \"#\" denotes the pixel currently being processed.\n\nNearly concurrently, J F Jarvis, C N Judice, and W H Ninke of Bell Labs disclosed a similar method which they termed \"\" using a larger kernel: \n\nError diffusion takes a monochrome or color image and reduces the number of quantization levels. A popular application of error diffusion involves reducing the number of quantization states to just two per channel. This makes the image suitable for printing on binary printers such as black and white laser printers.\n\nIn the discussion which follows, it is assumed that the number of quantization states in the error diffused image is two per channel, unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe simplest form of the algorithm scans the image one row at a time and one pixel at a time.\nThe current pixel is compared to a half-gray value. If it is above the value a white pixel is generated in the resulting image.\nIf the pixel is below the half way brightness, a black pixel is generated. Different methods may be used if the target palette is not monochrome, such as thresholding with two values if the target palette is black, gray and white.\nThe generated pixel is either full bright, or full black, so there is an error in the image.\nThe error is then added to the next pixel in the image and the process repeats.\n\nOne dimensional error diffusion tends to have severe image artifacts that show up as distinct vertical lines.\nTwo dimensional error diffusion reduces the visual artifacts.\nThe simplest algorithm is exactly like one dimensional error diffusion, except half the error is added to the next pixel, and half of the error is added to the pixel on the next line below.\n\nThe kernel is:\n\nwhere \"#\" denotes the pixel currently being processed.\n\nFurther refinement can be had by dispersing the error further away from the current pixel, as in the matrix given above in \"Enter the digital era\". The sample image at the start of this article is an example of two dimensional error diffusion.\n\nThe same algorithms may be applied to each of the red, green, and blue (or cyan, magenta, yellow, black) channels of a color image to achieve a color effect on printers such as color laser printers that can only print single color values.\n\nHowever, better visual results may be obtained by first converting the color channels into a perceptive color model that will separate lightness, hue and saturation channels, so that a higher weight for error diffusion will be given to the lightness channel, than to the hue channel. The motivation for this conversion is that human vision better perceives small differences of lightness in small local areas, than similar differences of hue in the same area, and even more than similar differences of saturation on the same area.\n\nFor example, if there is a small error in the green channel that cannot be represented, and another small error in the red channel in the same case, the properly weighted sum of these two errors may be used to adjust a perceptible lightness error, that can be represented in a balanced way between all three color channels (according to their respective statistical contribution to the lightness), even if this produces a larger error for the hue when converting the green channel. This error will be diffused in the neighboring pixels.\n\nIn addition, gamma correction may be needed on each of these perceptive channels, if they don't scale linearly with the human vision, so that error diffusion can be accumulated linearly to these gamma-corrected linear channels, before computing the final color channels of the rounded pixel colors, using a reverse conversion to the native non gamma-corrected image format and from which the new residual error will be computed and converted again to be distributed to the next pixels.\n\nIt should also be noted that, due to limitations of precision during the numeric conversion between color models (notably if this conversion is not linear or uses non integer weights), additional roundoff errors may occur that should be taken into account into the residual error.\n\nError Diffusion may also be used to produce output images with more than two levels (per channel, in the case of color images). This has application in displays and printers which can produce 4, 8, or 16 levels in each image plane, such as electrostatic printers and displays in compact mobile telephones. Rather than use a single threshold to produce binary output, the closest permitted level is determined, and the error, if any, is diffused as described above.\n\nMost printers overlap the black dots slightly so there is not an exact one-to-one relationship to dot frequency (in dots per unit area) and lightness. Tone scale linearization may be applied to the source image to get the printed image to look correct.\n\nWhen an image has a transition from light to dark the error diffusion algorithm tends to \nmake the next generated pixel be black. Dark to light transitions tend to result in the next\ngenerated pixel being white. This causes an edge enhancement effect at the expense of gray level\nreproduction accuracy. This results in error diffusion having a higher apparent resolution than other halftone methods. This is especially beneficial with images with text in them such as the typical facsimile.\n\nThis effect shows fairly well in the picture at the top of this article. The grass detail and the text on the sign is well preserved, \nand the lightness in the sky, containing little detail. A cluster-dot halftone image of the same resolution would be much less sharp.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1684962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1684962", "title": "Fula language", "text": "Fula language\n\nFula , also known as Fulani or Fulah<ref name=\"ISO 639-2/RA\"></ref><ref name=\"ISO 639-3/RA\"></ref> (Fula: \"Fulfulde, Pulaar, Pular\"; ), is a language spoken as a set of various dialects in a continuum that stretches across some 20 countries in West and Central Africa. Along with other related languages such as Serer and Wolof, it belongs to the Senegambian branch within the Niger–Congo languages, which does not have tones, unlike most other Niger–Congo languages. More broadly, it belongs to the Atlantic geographic grouping within Niger–Congo. It is spoken as a first language by the Fula people (\"Fulani\", ) from the Senegambia region and Guinea to Cameroon and Sudan and by related groups such as the Toucouleur people in the Senegal River Valley. It is also spoken as a second language by various peoples in the region, such as the Kirdi of northern Cameroon and northeastern Nigeria.\n\nThere are several names applied to the language, just as there are to the Fula people. They call their language Pulaar or Pular in the western dialects and Fulfulde in the central and eastern dialects. \"Fula(h)\" and \"Fulani\" in English come originally from Manding (esp. Mandinka, but also Malinke and Bamana) and Hausa, respectively; \"Peul\" in French, also occasionally found in literature in English, comes from Wolof.\n\nFula is based on verbo-nominal roots, from which verbal, noun and modifier words are derived. It uses suffixes (sometimes inaccurately called infixes, as they come between the root and the inflectional ending) to modify meaning. These suffixes often serve the same purposes in Fula that prepositions do in English.\n\nThe Fula or Fulfulde language is characterized by a robust noun class system, with 24 to 26 noun classes being common across the Fulfulde dialects (Arnett 1975: 5). Noun classes in Fula are abstract categories with some classes having semantic attributes that characterize a subset of that class’ members, and others being marked by a membership too diverse to warrant any semantic categorization of the class’ members (Paradis 1992: 25). For example, there are classes for stringy long things, and another for big things, another for liquids, a noun class for strong rigid objects, another for human or humanoid traits etc. Gender does not have any role in the Fula noun class system and the marking of gender is done with adjectives rather than class markers (Arnett 1975: 74). Noun classes are marked by suffixes on nouns. These suffixes are the same as the class name though they are frequently subject to phonological processes, most frequently the dropping of the suffix’s initial consonant (McIntosh 1984:45-46).\n\nThe table below illustrates the class name, the semantic property associated with class membership, and an example of a noun with its class marker. Classes 1 and 2 can be described as personal classes, classes 3-6 as diminutive classes, classes 7-8 as augmentative classes, and classes 9-25 as neutral classes. It is formed on the basis of McIntosh’s 1984 description of Kaceccereere Fulfulde, which the author describes as \"essentially the same\" as Arnott’s 1970 description of the noun classes of the Gombe dialect of Fula. Thus, certain examples from Arnott also informed this table (Arnott 1975: 5), (McIntosh 1984:44).\nVerbs in Fula are usually classed in 3 voices: active, middle, and passive. Not every root is used in all voices. Some middle voice verbs are reflexive.\n\nA common example are verbs from the root \"loot-\":\n\nAnother feature of the language is initial consonant mutation between singular and plural forms of nouns and of verbs (except in Pular, there is no consonant mutation in verbs, only in nouns).\n\nA simplified schema is as follows:\n\nFula has inclusive and exclusive first-person plural pronouns. The inclusive pronouns include both the speaker and those being spoken to, while the exclusive pronouns exclude the listeners.\n\nThe pronoun that corresponds to a given noun is determined by the noun class. Because men and women belong to the same noun class, the English pronouns \"he\" and \"she\" are translated into Fula by the same pronoun. However, depending on the dialect, there are some 25 different noun classes, each with its own pronoun. Sometimes those pronouns have both a nominative case (i.e., used as verb subject) and an accusative or dative case (i.e., used as a verb object) as well as a possessive form. Relative pronouns generally take the same form as the nominative.\n\nWhile there are numerous varieties of Fula, it is typically regarded as a single language. Wilson (1989) states that \"travelers over wide distances never find communication impossible,\" and Ka (1991) concludes that despite its geographic span and dialect variation, Fulfulde is still fundamentally one language. However, \"Ethnologue\" has found that nine different translations are needed to make the Bible comprehensible for most Fula speakers, and it treats these varieties as separate languages. They are listed in the box at the beginning of this article.\n\nFulfulde is an official language in Senegal \"(Pulaar)\", an official lingua franca in Guinea, Senegambia, Maasina, North Eastern Nigeria and Northern Cameroon (\"Pular\"), where many speakers are bilingual, and a national language in many African countries, such as Mauritania, Mali, Gambia, Guinea (Conakry), Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Togo, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger...\n\nWhen written using the Latin script, Fula uses the following additional special \"hooked\" characters to distinguish meaningfully different sounds in the language: Ɓ/ɓ , Ɗ/ɗ , Ŋ/ŋ , Ɲ/ɲ , Ƴ/ƴ . The letters c, j, and r, respectively represent the sounds [c], [ɟ], and [r]. Double vowel characters indicate that the vowels are elongated. An apostrophe (ʼ) is used as a glottal stop. It uses the five vowel system denoting vowel sounds and their lengths. In Nigeria ʼy substitutes ƴ, and in Senegal Ñ/ñ is used instead of ɲ.\n\na, aa, b, mb, ɓ, c, d, nd, ɗ, e, ee, f, g, ng, h, i, ii, j, nj, k, l, m, n, ŋ, ɲ (ny or ñ), o, oo, p, r, s, t, u, uu, w, y, ƴ, '\n\nThe letters q, v, x, z are used in some cases for loan words. In the Pular of Guinea an additional letter, ɠ [ɠ], is also part of the orthography, but it is also only used for loan words.\n\nThe standard Fulfulde alphabet adopted during the UNESCO-sponsored expert meeting in Bamako in March 1966 is as follows:\na, b, mb, ɓ, c, d, nd, ɗ, e, f, g, ng, h, i, j, nj, k, l, m, n, ŋ, ny (\"later\" ɲ \"or\" ñ), o, p, r, s, t, u, w, y, ƴ, '.\n\nBelow are some websites from different countries that use the Latin alphabet of Fula/Fulfulde:\n\nFula has also been written in the Arabic script or \"Ajami\" since before colonization by many scholars and learned people including Usman dan fodio and the early emirs of the northern Nigeria emirates. This continues to a certain degree and notably in some areas like Guinea and Cameroon. (citation?)\n\nIn fact, Fula retains many Arabic loanwords.\n\nThere were unsuccessful efforts in the 50s and 60s to create a unique script to write Fulfulde. In the 1990s, two teenage brothers, Ibrahima and Abdoulaye Barry from the Nzérékoré Region of Guinea, created the adlam script, which accurately represents all the sounds of Fulani. The script is written from right to left and includes 28 letters with 5 vowels and 23 consonants.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

An example of an artificial harbor is Long Beach Harbor, California, United States which was an array of salt marshes and tidal flats too shallow for modern merchant ships before it was first dredged in the early 20th century. In contrast, a natural harbor is surrounded on several sides by prominences of land. Examples of natural harbors include Sydney Harbour, Australia and Trincomalee Harbour in Sri Lanka.\n\nArtificial harbors are frequently built for use as ports. The oldest artificial harbor known is the Ancient Egyptian site at Wadi al-Jarf, on the Red Sea coast, which is at least 4500 years old (ca. 2600-2550 BC, reign of King Khufu). The largest artificially created harbor is Jebel Ali in Dubai. Other large and busy artificial harbors include: \n\nThe Ancient Carthaginians constructed fortified, artificial harbors called cothons.\n\nA natural harbor is a landform where a part of a body of water is protected and deep enough to furnish anchorage. Many such harbors are rias. Natural harbors have long been of great strategic naval and economic importance, and many great cities of the world are located on them. Having a protected harbor reduces or eliminates the need for breakwaters as it will result in calmer waves inside the harbor. Some examples are:\n\nFor harbors near the North and South Poles, being ice-free is an important advantage, especially when it is year-round. Examples of these include: \nThe world's southmost harbor, located at Antarctica's Winter Quarters Bay (77° 50′ South), is potentially ice-free, depending on the summertime pack ice conditions.\n\nAlthough the world's busiest port is a hotly contested title, in 2006 the world's busiest harbor by cargo tonnage was the Port of Shanghai.\n\nThe following are large natural harbors:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6710844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6710844", "title": "Hello", "text": "Hello\n\nHello is a salutation or greeting in the English language. It is first attested in writing from 1826.\n\n\"Hello\", with that spelling, was used in publications in the US as early as the 18 October 1826 edition of the \"Norwich Courier\" of Norwich, Connecticut. Another early use was an 1833 American book called \"The Sketches and Eccentricities of Col. David Crockett, of West Tennessee\", which was reprinted that same year in \"The London Literary Gazette\". The word was extensively used in literature by the 1860s.\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"hello\" is an alteration of \"hallo\", \"hollo\", which came from Old High German \"\"halâ\", \"holâ\", emphatic imperative of \"halôn\", \"holôn\" to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman.\" It also connects the development of \"hello\" to the influence of an earlier form, \"holla\", whose origin is in the French \"holà\" (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French \"là\" 'there'). As in addition to \"hello\", \"halloo\", \"hallo\", \"hollo\", \"hullo\" and (rarely) \"hillo\" also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using any of all five vowels.\n\nThe use of \"hello\" as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard \"Hullo\". Alexander Graham Bell initially used \"Ahoy\" (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:\n\nBy 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.\n\n\"Hello\" might be derived from \"hullo\", which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a \"chiefly British variant of hello,\" and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. \"Hullo\" is found in publications as early as 1803. The word \"hullo\" is still in use, with the meaning \"hello\".\n\n\"Hello\" is alternatively thought to come from the word \"hallo\" (1840) via \"hollo\" (also \"holla\", \"holloa\", \"halloo\", \"halloa\"). The definition of \"hollo\" is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted: \nFowler's has it that \"hallo\" is first recorded \"as a shout to call attention\" in 1864.\nIt is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" written in 1798:\nIn many Germanic languages, including German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Afrikaans, \"hallo\" literally translates into English as \"hello\". In the case of Dutch, it was used as early as 1797 in a letter from Willem Bilderdijk to his sister-in-law as a remark of astonishment. \n\nWebster's dictionary from 1913 traces the etymology of \"holloa\" to the Old English \"halow\" and suggests: \"Perhaps from ah + lo; compare Anglo Saxon ealā.\"\n\nAccording to the \"American Heritage Dictionary\", \"hallo\" is a modification of the obsolete \"holla\" (\"stop!\"), perhaps from Old French \"hola\" (\"ho\", ho! + \"la\", there, from Latin \"illac\", that way).\n\nThe Old English verb, hǽlan (1. wv/t1b 1 to heal, cure, save; greet, salute; gehǽl! Hosanna!), may be the ultimate origin of the word. Hǽlan is likely a cognate of German Heil (meaning \"complete\" for things and \"healthy\" for beings) and other similar words of Germanic origin. Bill Bryson asserts in his book \"Mother Tongue\" that \"hello\" comes from Old English \"hál béo þu\" (\"Hale be thou\", or \"whole be thou\", meaning a wish for good health) (see also \"goodbye\" which is a contraction of \"God be with you\".\n\nStudents learning a new computer programming language will often begin by writing a \"Hello, World!\" program, which does nothing but issue the message \"Hello, world\" to the user (such as by displaying it on a screen). This popular tradition arose from an introductory chapter of the book \"The C Programming Language\" by Kernighan & Ritchie, which reused the following example taken from earlier memos by Brian Kernighan at Bell Labs:\n\n\n"}

CRT screens display images by moving beams of electrons very quickly across the screen. Once the beam of the monitor has reached the edge of the screen, the beam is switched off, and the deflection circuit voltages (or currents) are returned to the values they had for the other edge of the screen; this would have the effect of retracing the screen in the opposite direction, so the beam is turned off during this time. This part of the line display process is the Horizontal Blank. \n\nIn detail, the Horizontal blanking interval consists of:\n\nIn the NTSC television standard, horizontal blanking occupies (17.2%) out of every scan line. In PAL, it occupies (18.8%) out of every scan line.\n\nIn the PAL television standard, the blanking level corresponds to the black level, whilst other standards, most notably NTSC, set the black level slightly above the blanking level on a 'pedestal'.\n\nSome graphics systems can count horizontal blanks and change how the display is generated during this blank time in the signal; this is called a raster effect, of which an example are raster bars.\n\nIn video games, the horizontal blanking interval was used to create some notable effects. Some methods of parallax scrolling use a raster effect to simulate depth in consoles that do not natively support multiple background layers or do not support enough background layers to achieve the desired effect. One example of this is in the game , which was written for the PC Engine CD-ROM which does not support multiple background layers. The Super NES's Mode 7 used the horizontal blanking interval to vary the scaling and rotation of one background layer on a scanline by scanline basis to create many different effects. The most famous and hyped effect of Mode 7 was to turn the background layer into a planar texture map.\n\n"}

He worked as editor and correspondent of many Nigerian newspapers, including \"Leadership\", \"The Tide\", \"New Nigerian\", \"The Reporter\" and \"Hotline Magazine\". He also authored the official biography of the late Major-General Shehu Musa Yar’Adua. He was pioneer editor of \"Blueprint Newspaper\" and later its editor-in chief. Sheme has been the Director of Media and Publicity at the National Open University of Nigeria since 2016\n\nSheme was born in Faskari Local Government Area, Katsina State, in 1966 or 1967. He attended Maigamji Primary School and Ruwan-Godiya Primary School, both in Funtua Local Government Area in the old Kaduna State (now in Katsina State, between 1973–1979, and finished his secondary school education at Government College, Kaduna, in 1984. He received his undergraduate degree in Mass Communication from Bayero University, Kano (BUK), in 1989. In the university, he was amongst the leading literary activists and served as both the editor-in-chief of The Parakeet, a literary journal, and editor of the Bayero Beacon, the official campus newspaper. He also served as secretary-general of the Katsina State Students Association. On graduation, he was awarded the two prizes for the Best Graduating Student in his faculty and the overall graduating student of the university.\n\nIn 1993, after working as a journalist in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and Kaduna, Sheme proceeded to the University of Wales in Cardiff, United Kingdom, where he received Master of Arts in Communication Studies in 1994. Sheme served as national publicity secretary of the Association of Nigerian Authors.\n\nSheme is one of the leading authors and literary critics in northern Nigeria. His first novel, \"Kifin Rijiya\" (The Ignoramus), which he wrote while still a student in Bayero University and was published in 1991, won second position in the Northern Languages Novel Writing Competition organised by the Kaduna State government.\n\nHis second novel, \"'Yartsana\" (The Doll), won the first place prize in the maiden Bashir Karaye Prize for Hausa Writing. His other works include \"The Malam's Potion\"_(a collection of short stories), a travelogue on his tour of Israel and the Palestinian territories titled \"Ilmi Mabudin Tafiya\", a biography of the late Major-General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, and a biography of the late Alhaji Mamman Shata titled \"Shata Ikon Allah!\" He also edited an anthology of short stories for the Association of Nigerian Authors titled \"Cramped Rooms and Open Spaces\".\n\nSheme was a central figure in the debate over Hausa romance fiction which raged in several newspapers and magazines in northern Nigeria between 1991 and 1999. The highly popular discourse, called \"The Great Soyayya Debate\", pitched writers, academics and literary critics such as Ibrahim Malumfashi, Abdalla Uba Adamu, Yusuf M. Adamu, Ado Ahmad Gidan Dabino, and others on the efficacy and need for the romance novels known as \"soyayya books\". Sheme initiated the debate as acting editor cum literary editor of Nasiha, the Hausa weekly newspaper being published by Nationhouse Press (publishers of The Reporter newspaper) in Kaduna. He took the debate to other media houses where he subsequently worked as editor or literary editor: Hotline and Rana magazines, New Nigerian, Weekly Trust, and Leadership newspaper. The debate attracted the attention of Nigerian and foreign scholars such as Professor Graham Furniss of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, who documented it.\n\nIn the mid-'90s, Sheme served as the national publicity secretary of Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA). He was also the pioneer secretary-general of ANA in Kaduna State.\n\nIbrahim Sheme has been linked to the robust filmmaking industry in northern Nigeria known as Kannywood. He wrote the script for many Hausa movies and even produced some. His movies include Gagarabadau (Unbeatable), Daren Farko (The First Night), and Fargaba (Fear). Sheme also wrote songs for several singers in Kannywood.\n\nHis most notable activity in Kannywood, however, has been the publication of the two leading newsmagazines, Fim and Bidiyo. Fim (meaning Film) was set up by Sheme and some friends of his in March 1999, with Sheme as the publisher. He was to take over the monthly magazine as sole owner in 2002 and has been publishing it without fail since then. The magazine publishes news, interviews, gossip, etc., about stakeholders in the industry, but it later expanded its coverage to Hausa culture in general, with a section on traditional music, creative writing, and craft. The section was actually created after the death of Bahaushiya, a quarterly magazine founded by Sheme in 2006 to fill a void. The magazine Bidiyo (Video), which Sheme founded with a focus solely on the art of filmmaking, was rested after 10 editions due to low patronage because the readers preferred the scintillating gossip and lifestyle news Fim magazine provides. But Fim has suffered low sale in recent years due to the pervasive encroachment of the social media in journalism generally. From over 10,000 copies monthly sale, it has come down to a few hundred. However, there has been a marked shift by the magazine to operate its news-selling business online – in its website and social media handles.\n\n"}
{"id": "187108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187108", "title": "Jib", "text": "Jib\n\nA jib is a triangular sail that sets ahead of the foremast of a sailing vessel. Its tack is fixed to the bowsprit, to the bows, or to the deck between the bowsprit and the foremost mast. Jibs and spinnakers are the two main types of headsails on a modern boat.\n\nBoats may be sailed using a jib alone, more commonly jib(s) make a minor direct contribution to propulsion, compared to a main sail. Generally, a jib's most crucial function is as an airfoil, increasing performance and overall stability by reducing turbulence on the main sail's leeward side.\nOn boats with only one jib, it is common for the clew of the jib to be abaft the mast, meaning the jib and mainsail overlap. An overlapping jib is called a \"genoa jib\" or simply a genoa (see illustration). These are efficiently used when reaching more broadly than a close reach. Alternatively, a boat may carry smaller jibs, to compensate aerodynamics when the main sail is reefed; these more rugged sails are called \"storm jibs\" or \"spitfires\".\n\nOn a boat with two staysails the inner sail is called the \"staysail\", and the outer (foremost) is called the jib. This combination of two staysails is called a \"cutter rig\" (or in North America a \"yankee pair\") and a boat with one mast rigged with two staysails and a mainsail is called a cutter.\n\nOn cruising yachts, and nearly all racing sailboats, the jib needs to be worked when tacking. On these yachts, there are two sheets attached to the clew of the jib. As the yacht comes head to wind during a tack, the active sheet is released, and the other sheet (the \"lazy sheet\") on the other side of the boat is pulled in. This sheet becomes the new \"active sheet\" until the next tack.\n\nSchooners typically have up to three jibs. The foremost one sets on the topmast forestay and is generally called the \"jib topsail\", a second on the main forestay is called \"the jib\", and the innermost is called \"the staysail\". Actually, all three sails are both jibs and staysails in the generic sense.\n\nOriginal usage in 18th and 19th century square-rigged ships distinguished between the fore staysail, set on the forestay running from the foremast head to the ship's peak, the foremost part of the hull, and the jibs set on stays running to the bowsprit. Jibs, but not staysails, could also be \"set flying,\" i.e. not attached to the standing rigging. Sails set beyond the peak were typically called jibs, set on stays running from the fore topmast to the bowsprit, or the fore topgallant mast to the jibboom or even the fore royal mast to the flying jibboom. A large square-rigged ship typically has four jibs, but could have as many as six.\n\nFrom forward to aft, these sails are called:\n\nThe first two were rarely used except by clipper ships in light winds and were usually set flying. A storm jib was a small jib of heavy canvas set to a stay to help to control the ship in bad weather.\n\nThe jib is referenced in the idiom usually spoken as \"I like the cut of your jib\", generally seen as signifying approval of one's general appearance or respect for their character. The phrase alludes to the maritime practice of identifying far-away ships by noting the \"cut\" (general shape and configuration) of their sails to determine their status as friend or foe. One such report from the \"Naval Chronicle\" (1805)—\"we perceived by the cut of their sails, then set, that they were French Ships of War\"—is often cited as an early inspiration for the idiom.\n\nSir Walter Scott used the expression to denote approval in the 1824 novel \"St. Ronan's Well\": \"If she disliked what the sailor calls the \"cut of their jib\"\". John Russell Bartlett later defined the idiom in his 1848 \"Dictionary of Americanisms\" as \"The form of his profile, the cast of his countenance\". This usage alludes to a frequent variation of meaning which describes approval, specifically, of the shape of one's nose, which roughly approximates the frontal position and triangular shape of the jib sail on a boat.\n\n"}

His tenure was occupied by the \"affair of Achaea\", the persistent, but ultimately fruitless, efforts by the Knights to acquire the Principality of Achaea in southern Greece. He was also a great patron of the translation and composition of historiographical works in the Aragonese language and a counsellor to two Kings of Aragon.\n\nHeredia was born in Munebrega, Kingdom of Aragon. As a knight of the Hospitaller order (from 1328), Heredia was the commander of the castles of Villel, Aliaga, and Alfambra. He was originally patronised by Peter IV of Aragon and Pope Innocent VI. Through the aid of the latter, he was appointed to govern the grand priories of the kingdoms of Castile and León, and of the abbey of Saint-Gilles in southern France, the richest priory of the order. He supported Peter IV against the Union of Aragon and fought on his side in the successful Battle of Epila (1348). \n\nIn 1346, with the king of Aragon's support, he gained the castellany of Amposta (which was the priory of Aragon). Heredia made himself and his family (and illegitimate children) enormously wealthy at the expense of the order. His power and influence was greatly circumscribed by the Grand Master Raymond Berengar, but in 1371 he entered the favour of Pope Urban V and was elevated as the master's lieutenant in Western Europe.\n\nIn 1376, Heredia conducted the fleet bearing Pope Gregory XI back to Rome, presaging the end of the Avignon Papacy. The next year, on September 24, Gregory formally appointed Heredia grand master, following the death of Robert of Juilly on July 27. Heredia embarked from Naples for Romania late in 1377, arriving in Vonitsa in April 1378. Heredia immediately set about to take Arta but was captured by Ghin Boua Spata, lord of Aetolia and Acarnania, and sold to the Ottoman Turks. He was quickly ransomed, for he was in Glarentsa on 20 May 1379, though during his absence, his commandant, Gaucher of La Bastide, hired the Navarrese Company of mercenaries and brought them to the Principality of Achaea for eight months. \n\nAfter his release, Heredia went to Rhodes, the headquarters of the order, in July. Power was readily ceded to him, as he was an adherent of the Avignonese Pope Clement VII. Heredia tried to make a deal to have the Navarrese turn over the castles they were holding in the name of the prince to the military order. The Navarrese' preponderant demands, however, quickly sunk any possible agreement. Heredia ignored the powerful company and instead dealt directly with Marie of Blois, who claimed the principality on behalf of her son Louis II of Naples. Marie signed over her son's rights to the order on 24 January 1387, with the consent of Clement VII. The transaction cost the order 20,000 gold \"florins\". Later, the pope reversed his endorsement at the request of the Achaean claimant Amadeus, Lord of Pinerolo. \n\nDespite these failures with the Navarrese, Heredia had continued to use them in his war. Though Peter IV had forbid any Hospitallers of his realm to travel with Heredia east, he himself had claimed the rights to the Duchy of Athens. The Navarrese, under Juan de Urtubia, attacked Thebes, the capital of the duchy, and Heredia, though friendly with the king, was warned in a letter to stop abetting his enemies (10 September 1380). \n\nHeredia spent most of his life in Avignon after 9 April 1382, when he embarked for the West with his powers diminished some by the untrusting convent in Rhodes. In April 1383, the Roman Pope Urban VI appointed Riccardo Caracciolo, prior of Capua, anti-master in opposition to Heredia. Caracciolo had the support of some Italian priories, of the England and other Urbanist regions, but his power was insignificant by his death in 1395, after which no one was elected to replace him. Heredia did not long survive him and was succeeded by Philibert of Naillac. \n\nHeredia was wealthy and learned, a patron of historiography and translation. It was he who ordered the \"Chronicle of Morea\" translated into Aragonese sometime before 1393, though it does not contain any mention of his term of service in the Morea. The medieval stonework of his fortified castles in Mora de Rubielos and Rubielos de Mora has been much studied in the last few years. He was buried in Caspe. His tomb was destroyed by anarchist soldiers during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), although some photographs remain.\n\n"}

It is probably a dialect of Iranian Tati, otherwise found only in Iran. It was spoken in the villages around Kilit, located 12 kilometers southwest from the city of Ordubad in a district with the same name of Nakhchivan in Azerbaijan. It was still used by non-native speakers as a second language in the 1950s.\n\nThe language has been long known to the Russian historians and travelers since the middle of nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries. The historian Chopin, first mentioned it back in 1852. He states the inhabitants of the village as amounting to 104. Zelinsky researched on the language in 1880 afterwards. In the 1950s a few speakers was reported who used the language probably only as a trade lingo or secret language. In 1966, A. G. Gasanov collected a few words and phrases. Although the possibility of a migration cannot be ruled out, however it is more likely, given more data about Tatic languages and proto-Tatic, that this group extended at least as far as the areas in which the remanent languages are spoken today.\n\nThe following is a kiliti text reported by Zelinsky: Transliterated from Cyrillic :\n\nComparative list of numbers and some words mentioned by Zelinsky and Gasanov:\n\nChopin remarks that the inhabitants of Kilit village were professing Shiite faith and their language is not similar to any of the other local dialects. However he has been puzzled about their origin. He mentioned that they might be from Armenian origin or more likely Talyshi, Tat, Tajik or Zoroastrian. Zelinsky considered it as a mixture of Kurdish, Persian and Arabic. Gasanov called it with a certain affinity towards Iranian languages. But only Zelinsky's materials are enough to understand that kiliti is not an argot, possesses an independent grammatical structure and have the main base of the root words and all the typical features of the Iranian languages. The existing materials also provide a sufficient basis to determine it as belonging to the northwestern Iranian group of languages. That language had no written tradition. According to Zelinsky, dozens of villages had spoken the language before, but it was just understandable to the villagers afterwards and then the Azerbaijani language replaced it.\n\n"}

It is closely related to the other Maa varieties: Samburu (or Sampur), the language of the Samburu people of central Kenya, Chamus, spoken south and southeast of Lake Baringo (sometimes regarded as a dialect of Samburu); and Parakuyu of Tanzania. The Maasai, Samburu, il-Chamus and Parakuyu peoples are historically related and all refer to their language as \"ɔl Maa\". Properly speaking, \"Maa\" refers to the language and the culture and \"Maasai\" refers to the people \"who speak Maa.\"\n\nThe Maasai people, from the Eastern region of the African continent, have been protected from the widespread Westernization of agriculture and colonization because they inhabit a primarily desert area. Because the Maasai have resisted forms of colonization and Western expansion, their systems of communication and exchange revolve primarily around the trade they do within the tribe. Therefore, the spoken language is not only the most significant point of contact that the Maasai use but also one of the only ways that Maasai can continue to thrive in their traditional tribal way of life.\n\nThe loss of the Maasai language, while not rapid, is happening as a result of close contact with other tribal groups in East Africa and the rise of Swahili and English as the dominant languages. In Tanzania, former President Nyerere encouraged the adoption of Swahili as an official language to unite the many different ethnic groups in Tanzania, as well as English to compete on a global scale. Although the Maasai language, often referred to as Maa, has survived despite the mass influx of English and Swahili education systems, economic plans, and more, the socioeconomic climate that the Maasai people face in East Africa keeps them, and their language, as an underrepresented minority.\n\nThe Maasai way of life is embedded in their language. Specifically, the economic systems of trade that the Maasai rely on in order to maintain their nomadic way of life, relies on the survival of the Maasai language, even in its minority status. With language endangerment, the Maasai tribe would continue to be threatened and its cultural integrity threatened. The minority status that the language currently faces has already threatened traditional Maasai practices. Fewer and fewer groups of Maasai continue to be nomadic in the region, choosing to settle instead in close knit communities to keep their language and other aspects of their culture alive.\n\nThe Maasai variety of \"ɔl Maa\" as spoken in southern Kenya and Tanzania has 30 contrasting sounds, which can be represented and alphabetized as followsː \"a\", \"b\", \"ch\" (a variant of \"sh\"), \"d\", \"e\", \"ɛ\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"ɨ\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"ny\", \"ŋ\", \"o\", \"ɔ\", \"p\", \"r\", \"rr\", \"s\", \"sh\" (with variant \"ch\"), \"t\", \"u\", \"ʉ\", \"w\", \"wu\" (or \"ww\"), \"y\", \"yi\" (or \"yy\"), and the glottal stop \"<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" (or \"ʔ\").\n\nTone is extremely important for conveying correct meaning in the Maasai language.\n\nIn the table of consonant phonemes below, phonemes are represented with IPA symbols. When IPA conventions differ from symbols normally used in practical writing, the latter are given in angle brackets.\n\nFor some Maasai speakers, the voiced stop consonants are not particularly implosive (e.g. IlKeekonyokie Maa), but for others they are lightly implosive or have a glottalic feature (e.g. Parakuyo Maa). In Arusha Maa, is typically realized as a voiceless fricative , but in some words it can be a voiced trill . At least in native Maa words, and occur in complementary distribution, with the former occurring directly after consonants and the latter elsewhere.\n\nLike the other Maa languages, Maasai has advanced tongue root vowel harmony. There are nine contrasting vowels, with the vowel being \"neutral\" for harmony.\n\nWord order is usually verb–subject–object, though order can vary because tone is the most important indicator of subject versus object. What really determines order in a clause is topicality; order in the most simple clauses can be predicted according to the information structure pattern: [Verb – Most.Topical – Less.Topical]. Thus, if the object is highly topical in the discourse (e.g. a first-person pronoun), and the subject is less topical, then the object will occur right after the verb and before the subject.\n\nThe Maasai language has only two fully grammatical prepositions, but can use \"relational nouns\" along with a most general preposition to designate specific locative ideas. Noun phrases begin with a demonstrative prefix or a gender-number prefix, followed by a quantifying noun or other head noun. Other modifiers follow the head noun, including possessive phrases.\n\nIn Maasai, many morphemes are actually tone patterns. For example:\n\nThe Maasai language carries three forms of gendered nouns; feminine, masculine, and place. Native speakers of the language attach a gendered prefix to a noun. The meaning of the noun in context then refers to its gender. Nouns place gender as follows:\n\n\"Who has come?\" would be asked if the gender of the visitor were known. The noun would be preceded by a gendered prefix. If the gender of the visitor were unknown, \"it is who that has come?\" would be the correct [English translation] question. \n\nAdjectives in Maa serve only to describe the noun, and change tenses depending on the noun that they are describing. \n\nPronouns in Maa usually assign gender (male, female, or place); if gender is unknown, the meaning of the noun in context will usually refer to a gender. For example, the context of a female might include working in the house while a male gender would be implied if the action referred to work outside the home. The Maasai language uses place as a personal pronoun because place can help identify male or female (i.e. an action occurring in the house will almost always be done by a female).\n\nConsonants in Maasai are pronounced with a “gulp” sound. Tone helps to indicate the verb-subject-order agreement.\n\nPresent tense in Maasai includes habitual actions, such as “I wake up” or “I cook breakfast”. Past tense refers only to past action, not a specific time or place.\n\n\n"}

Benefits are also described. Written by Eknath Easwaran, the book was originally published in the United States in 1977. Several subsequent editions have been published, sometimes under different titles, in the United States, the United Kingdom, and India. Foreign (non-English) editions have also been published in several languages. The book has been reviewed in newspapers, magazines, and websites, and discussed in professional journals. It has also been a focus of scientific research. The subtitle of the fifth (2009) US edition is: \"a practical guide to choosing your mantram & calming your mind\".\n\nEaswaran's \"Mantram Handbook\" provides an introduction to the practice of repeating mantrams and/or holy names, terms the author uses interchangeably. The book offers the author's practical guidance for choosing a mantram and using it for personal centering and spiritual growth. In the opening chapters, the author recommends selecting a single mantram (such as those in the table at right), and suggests that the reader \"take your time choosing a mantram... then, once you have chosen a mantram, do not change it.\" Most of the remainder of the book discusses how to integrate the mantram into daily living to improve skills and solve various types of problems. Late in the book, Easwaran describes how the mantram can be combined with other spiritual practices, such as meditation. Easwaran's approach is distinctive, in that he recommends a method of sitting meditation that does \"not\" focus on the mantram. Accordingly, the entire concern of the \"Mantram Handbook\" is in how to use a mantram throughout the day, at times \"apart\" from sitting meditation.\n\nWith only slight variation, each edition of the \"Mantram Handbook\" has contained the same 12 major parts:\n\nThe most recent (5th) US edition contains a foreword by Daniel H. Lowenstein. Offering perspectives as a neurologist and medical educator, Lowenstein states that\n\nThe book also contains an index.\n\nReviews of the \"Mantram Handbook\" have appeared in \n\"The Hindu\",\n\"Business Standard\" (India),\n\"The Economic Times\" (India),\n\"The B.C. Catholic\",\nthe \"Pacific Sun\",\n\"Cosmos\" (Australia),\n\"Medical Self-Care\",\n\"Journal of Ecumenical Studies\",\n\"Journal of Psychology and Christianity\",\n\"Journal of Transpersonal Psychology\",\nand \"Booklist\".\nThe \"Mantram Handbook\" has also been discussed in books authored by Andrew Weil, in books edited by Thomas G. Plante and J. Harold Ellens, and on websites such as \"Spirituality and Health\".\n\nAndrew Weil stated that the \"Mantram Handbook\" \"is the only book I have seen on the use of mantram as a centering technique.\"\n\nIn the \"Business Standard\", Apratim Barua wrote that \n\nMantram Handbook... is concise, simple and practical... Where Easwaran scores over other books of a similar type is in his non-sectarian approach and his appeal to common-sense... Second, Easwaran's account is deeply personal and, therefore, all the more convincing. He has traversed the same path himself and is aware of all the snares and pitfalls. The tone of the book is cheerful, optimistic and positive... The book is not merely about mantrams. Its aim is the cultivation of a more wholesome and positive approach to life.\nIn the \"Journal of Psychology and Christianity\", Doug Oman and Joseph Driskill wrote that\n\nFor people of any religious faith or none, Easwaran offers a highly practical yet consistently spiritual discussion of integrating a holy name into daily modern living. Presenting the most comprehensive practical discussion of how to draw upon a holy name throughout the day in a variety of ordinary and challenging situations, this book is also uniquely universal as a resource for professionals working with diverse populations.\nIn \"The Hindu\", Anita Joshua wrote that \n\nKnowing full well the potential of the mantram in releasing new and positive energy that can help chase away seemingly incurable problems, Eknath Easwaran took upon himself the task of explaining it in the most simplest of terms and the way it works on the human system. And, at the outset itself, he explains that mantram is not exclusive to the Hindu religion... He signs off by explaining how the mantram relates to a large body of spiritual disciplines ... [and] is particularly careful to differentiate such spiritual disciplines from dogmas.\nAlso in \"The Hindu\", M. P. Pandit wrote that as an\n\nexponent of Eastern spiritual disciplines in the university circles in the West, Eknath Easwaran has evolved a style that makes abstruse concepts simple and appealing... The author refutes the charge that the practice of mantra is self-hypnosis. It is not that any word repeated for a length of time will have the same results... he explains mantra as 'that which enables us to cross the sea of the mind.' Actually the traditional derivation is \"mananat trayate\", helps to cross the ocean of \"samsara\".\n\"The Economic Times\" (India) wrote that \"Easwaran strips the mystery off the mantram and explains how it can help us gain the will and insight to refashion our lives\":\n\nThe method Easwaran suggests is simple: pick a mantram of 'proven power' recommended by the great spiritual teachers of any religion that you follow. Easwaran makes no attempt to avoid references to religion and the aim of his technique is, in fact, to take one closer to God. Claims Easwaran: \"Constant repetition and practice is required for the mantram to take root in our consciousness and gradually transform it, just as constant repetition makes the advertiser's jingle stick in our minds.\"... Even a sceptic could benefit from the solutions Easwaran puts forward.\nIn the \"Journal of Ecumenical Studies\", E. James Baesler noted that \"several of the eastern Christian and eastern Hindu traditions recommend reciting the Holy Name outside the predetermined prayer periods.\" Most also \n\nrecommend reciting the Holy Name during a time set apart exclusively for prayer... The one exception to this pattern is Easwaran's <nowiki>[</nowiki>\"Mantram Handbook\"<nowiki>]</nowiki> recommendation to recite the Holy Name at virtually all times except the time set apart for meditation/prayer. Easwaran's rationale... is that meditation times are for... the repetition of an inspirational passage, while repeating the <nowiki>[</nowiki>mantram<nowiki>]</nowiki> does not require as much discipline and thus can be 'prayed' anytime.\n\nIn the \"Journal of Transpersonal Psychology\", Thomas Weide wrote that \"for a so-called handbook, the book mentions surprisingly few different mantrams, and omits much material commonly covered by mantram advocates.\" But Weide recommended the book \"highly to the total transpersonal public, not just to mantram lovers,\" stating that\n\nEaswaran writes with lovely simplicity about how to live a more spiritual life in general, and... gives a splendid explanation of how mantrams work, how to choose one, and above all, how to work on oneself in general, using a mantram merely as one of several important practices.\nSimilarly, Apratim Barua (quoted above) expressed concern that \"The title is a slight misnomer. The book is not merely about mantrams... If anything, the number of mantrams discussed is woefully inadequate. He takes up some four in all [sic], one from each major religion... This may be due to the fact that the aim of the book is the cultivation of a more wholesome and positive approach to life.\"\n\nIn \"Medical Self-Care\", Thomas Ferguson wrote that the \"Mantram Handbook\" described \"how mantrams work, how to choose one, and how to use it... Spiritual, non-sectarian, quietly delightful.\" \"Booklist\" wrote that \"This guide by a Hindu expert on religions is refreshingly real. He also contradicts popular misconceptions about mantrams and gives practical advice.\"\n\nSections of the book have been excerpted.\n\nThe \"Mantram Handbook\" was the primary instructional text in several research studies on mantram repetition conducted through the Veterans Administration in San Diego, California, by Jill Bormann and her colleagues. Randomized trials that she led have reported benefits from mantram repetition that include higher quality of life, increased use of positive strategies of coping with stress, gains in faith/assurance and spiritual connectedness, and reductions in psychological distress, PTSD symptoms, and anger. Additional research findings offered evidence linking mantram use with reduced stress, anxiety, anger, and PTSD symptoms, as well as increased quality of life and spiritual well-being, and documenting that study participants found mantram repetition useful for managing stress, emotions, sleep/insomnia, and unwanted thoughts. The \"Mantram Handbook\" was also cited as a main source in developing a mantram-centered intervention for nurses in Korea. The intervention was found to reduce burnout, and to enhance well-being, spiritual integrity, and leadership practice.\n\nAll US editions have been published by Nilgiri Press, which also published the original 1977 edition.

He began his career writing for the Jewish press in support of the Russian Revolution in 1910. During the First World War, he moved to the United States in 1915, settling in New York City, where he continued his career in Jewish journalism. Much of his work was in support of communism, and he was a founding member of the Workers Party. In 1922, he founded \"The Morning Freiheit\", and served as its editor until his death in 1939.\n\nMoissaye Joseph Olgin was born on March 24, 1878 in Buki, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire) to Chaim Aaron Novominsky and Tsipe (Gelman) Novominsky, both of whom were of ethnic Jewish origins. His father worked as a lumber camp employee.\n\nOlgin received a traditional education in Hebrew. After a short period of self-study, he began his studies at the University of Kiev in 1900.\n\nHe was sympathetic to the causes of the Russian Revolution, and first became active in the underground revolutionary movement during his studies at the University of Kiev. His writings for Jewish and revolutionary publications earned him some fame among the many Russian Jews, who were heavily oppressed by the government of Tsar Nicholas II. He took part in a Jewish revolutionary student group known as \"Freiheit\" (Freedom).\n\nIn 1901 Olgin was elected chairman of the Students Central Committee. The tsarist regime ordered his arrest in April 1903 on a charge of organizing Jewish self-defense groups against anticipated pogroms.\n\nIn 1904, Olgin left the University of Kiev and went to Vilno as a member of the Vilno Committee of the Jewish Bund. There he was arrested but released on bail. He then became a member of the editorial board of the Arbeiter Stimme (Labor's Voice). He was the author of all the proclamations issued by the Central Committee of the Bund during the Revolution of 1905 while at the same time he prepared literary compositions for the illegal Jewish press. While editing newspapers and working with these underground organizations he also wrote books, short stories and literary essays.\n\nIn 1907, he traveled to Germany to continue his studies at the University of Heidelberg. He continued his studies there until 1910, when he returned to Russia.\n\nTraveling in Germany at the onset of World War I, he was unable to return to Russia, and immigrated to the United States in 1915.\n\nShortly after arriving in the United States, Olgin became a regular contributor to the Jewish daily newspaper \"The Forward\".\n\nOlgin became an American citizen in April 1920. He was a leading member of the Jewish Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party of America and was influential in leading the JSF out of the party at a special convention of the organization held in September 1921. Together with other defecting members of the JSF, Olgin thereafter entered the fledgling Workers Council organization, a small group of revolutionary socialists which rejected the conspiratorial \"underground\" form of organization of the then extant communist movement. Olgin ceased contributing to \"The Forward\" at this same time.\n\nIn April 1922, there was launched a new Yiddish-language newspaper, the Daily \"Freiheit\" (later the \"Morning Freiheit\"). Olgin served as first editor of this publication, a position which he retained up until the time of his death. He also contributed frequently to the Communist Party's English-language newspaper, \"The Daily Worker,\" and served as a special correspondent for the Soviet Communist Party's daily, \"Pravda.\"\n\nAt the end of December 1922, the Workers Council group was among the organizations which were united into the Workers Party of America (WPA), a new \"legal political party\" affiliated with the underground Communist Party of America, and Olgin thereby entered the formal communist movement for the first time. Olgin was named to the governing Bureau of the Jewish Federation of this new organization. Olgin was a member of the governing Central Executive Committee of the WPA and its Executive Council from the time of the organization's formation.\n\nOlgin was a frequent candidate for political office on behalf of the Communist Party. He first ran in 1924, when he was a candidate for New York State Assembly on the ticket of the Workers Party. He ran for U.S. Congress in 1926, 1930, and 1934, and for New York Assembly again in 1927, 1929, 1933, and 1936.\n\nAlthough a bitter rival of Alexander Bittelman in the heated factional politics of the Jewish Federation in the early 1920s, by the middle of the decade, Olgin had emerged as a supporter of the political faction that was headed by William Z. Foster, Earl Browder, and his former foe.\n\nOlgin made several trips to the Soviet Union. In 1937, he went to Paris as delegation to the International Yiddish Culture Congress which founded the World Alliance for Jewish Culture (YCUF). While in Paris, he addressed the Writers Congress.\n\nFollowing his trip to Paris, Olgin's health began to decline. After almost two years' illness, during which Olgin continued his work for the \"Freiheit\", as well as for the \"Daily Worker\" and as the American correspondent for \"Pravda\", he had apparently improved in health enough to appear at Madison Square Garden, on November 13, for his first public speech in several years. Following the speech, his health again declined, and he died at his home of a heart attack on November 22, 1939. He was buried in New Montefiore Cemetery near Farmingdale, New York.\n\nOlgin was the author of numerous books and pamphlets in seven languages: English, Russian, German, French, Polish, Hebrew and Yiddish. It is not known whether some of these works were, in fact, translated by others. He wrote verse, essays, literary criticism and sociological studies. His books \"The Soul of the Russian Revolution\" and \"A Guide to Russian Literature\" and pamphlet \"Why Communism?\" achieved sales of nearly half a million in several languages.\n\nOlgin translated several volumes of Lenin's collected works from Russian into English; Friedrich Engels' \"The Peasant War in Germany\" from German into Yiddish; John Reed's \"Ten Days That Shook the World\" from English into Yiddish; a volume of short stories from Polish into Yiddish; two volumes of tales of Mendele Mocher Sforim, the father of Jewish literature, from Hebrew into Yiddish; and Jack London's \"Call of the Wild\" from English into Yiddish.\n\nOlgin was known as one of the most enthusiastic proponents of the Stalinist current in American Communism. For example, he was the Party's expert on fighting Trotskyism (see reference to his book on that subject; below).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37183", "title": "Novikov self-consistency principle", "text": "Novikov self-consistency principle\n\nThe Novikov self-consistency principle, also known as the Novikov self-consistency conjecture and Larry Niven's law of conservation of history, is a principle developed by Russian physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov in the mid-1980s. Novikov intended it to solve the problem of paradoxes in time travel, which is theoretically permitted in certain solutions of general relativity that contain what are known as closed timelike curves. The principle asserts that if an event exists that would cause a paradox or any \"change\" to the past whatsoever, then the probability of that event is zero. It would thus be impossible to create time paradoxes.\n\nPhysicists have long known that some solutions to the theory of general relativity contain closed timelike curves—for example the Gödel metric. Novikov discussed the possibility of closed timelike curves (CTCs) in books he wrote in 1975 and 1983, offering the opinion that only self-consistent trips back in time would be permitted. In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, \"Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves\", the authors state:\n\nAmong the co-authors of this 1990 paper were Kip Thorne, Mike Morris, and Ulvi Yurtsever, who in 1988 had stirred up renewed interest in the subject of time travel in general relativity with their paper \"Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition\", which showed that a new general relativity solution known as a traversable wormhole could lead to closed timelike curves, and unlike previous CTC-containing solutions, it did not require unrealistic conditions for the universe as a whole. After discussions with another co-author of the 1990 paper, John Friedman, they convinced themselves that time travel needn't lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of the object sent through the wormhole.\n\nUpon considering the scenario, two students at Caltech (where Thorne taught), Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar \"The Hammer\" Klinkhammer, arrived at a solution to the problem that managed to avoid any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball emerges from the future at a different angle than the one that generates the paradox, and delivers its younger self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow alters its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each situation. Later analysis by Thorne and Robert Forward illustrated that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions.\n\nEcheverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find \"any\" initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven. This only applies to initial conditions outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime, which is bounded by a Cauchy horizon. This could mean that the Novikov self-consistency principle does not actually place any constraints on systems outside of the region of space-time where time travel is possible, only inside it.\n\nEven if self-consistent extensions can be found for arbitrary initial conditions outside the Cauchy Horizon, the finding that there can be multiple distinct self-consistent extensions for the same initial condition—indeed, Echeverria et al. found an infinite number of consistent extensions for every initial trajectory they analyzed—can be seen as problematic, since classically there seems to be no way to decide which extension the laws of physics will choose. To get around this difficulty, Thorne and Klinkhammer analyzed the billiard ball scenario using quantum mechanics, performing a quantum-mechanical sum over histories (path integral) using only the consistent extensions, and found that this resulted in a well-defined probability for each consistent extension. The authors of \"Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves\" write:\n\nThe Novikov consistency principle assumes certain conditions about what sort of time travel is possible. Specifically, it assumes either that there is only one timeline, or that any alternative timelines (such as those postulated by the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics) are not accessible.\n\nGiven these assumptions, the constraint that time travel must not lead to inconsistent outcomes could be seen merely as a tautology, a self-evident truth that can not possibly be false. However, the Novikov self-consistency principle is intended to go beyond just the statement that history must be consistent, making the additional nontrivial assumption that the universe obeys the same local laws of physics in situations involving time travel that it does in regions of space-time that lack closed timelike curves. This is clarified in the above-mentioned \"Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves\", where the authors write:\n\nThe assumptions of the self-consistency principle can be extended to hypothetical scenarios involving intelligent time travelers as well as unintelligent objects such as billiard balls. The authors of \"Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves\" commented on the issue in the paper's conclusion, writing:\n\nSimilarly, physicist and astronomer J. Craig Wheeler concludes that:\n\nTime-loop logic, coined by roboticist and futurist Hans Moravec, is a hypothetical system of computation that exploits the Novikov self-consistency principle to compute answers much faster than possible with the standard model of computational complexity using Turing machines. In this system, a computer sends a result of a computation backwards through time and relies upon the self-consistency principle to force the sent result to be correct, provided the machine can reliably receive information from the future and provided the algorithm and the underlying mechanism are formally correct. An incorrect result or no result can still be produced if the time travel mechanism or algorithm are not guaranteed to be accurate.\n\nA simple example is an iterative method algorithm. Moravec states:\n\nPhysicist David Deutsch showed in 1991 that this model of computation could solve NP problems in polynomial time, and Scott Aaronson later extended this result to show that the model could also be used to solve PSPACE problems in polynomial time. Deutsch shows that quantum computation with a negative delay—backwards time travel—produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning. Researchers published in 2014 a simulation in which they claim to have validated Deutsch's model with photons.\nHowever, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's self-consistency condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic quantum field theory even on spacetimes which do not admit closed timelike curves, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's model is really characteristic of quantum processes simulating closed timelike curves in the sense of general relativity.\nNovikov's views are not widely accepted. General relativity researcher Matt Visser views causal loops and Novikov's self-consistency principle as an \"ad hoc\" solution, and supposes that there are far more damaging implications of time travel. Time-travel researcher Serguei Krasnikov similarly finds no inherent fault in causal loops, but finds other problems with time travel in general relativity.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1428043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1428043", "title": "Pin (professional wrestling)", "text": "Pin (professional wrestling)\n\nA pinfall is a victory condition in various forms of professional wrestling that is met by holding (pinning) an opponent's shoulders on the wrestling mat, usually until the referee counts to three. In professional wrestling, a pinfall is a common method of winning a match.\n\nThe count is broken (a near-fall) if the opponent manages to raise one or both of his shoulders off of the mat, commonly by \"kicking out\" (throwing their legs up to cause their shoulders to rise from the mat). In some positions, a wrestler may \"bridge\" (arching their back so that only their feet and the top of their head are touching the ground) to put more of their weight on the pinned opponent or to prop themselves up from being pinned. Sometimes, an attacking wrestler may (illegally) hook the opponent's tights for extra leverage. Another popular illegal tactic of heel wrestlers is to attempt a pin close to the ring ropes so they can prop their legs (or on rare occasions, arms) up on the ropes to gain additional leverage, putting more weight on the opponent. On the other hand, a pin fall attempt cannot occur in the first place when one rolls out of the ring if falls do \"not \"count anywhere, or if the opponent lies on his/her stomach upon impact, so it would take extra effort to roll the opponent over, even when he/she is knocked out cold due to the body being effectively a dead weight.\n\nThe attacking wrestler stands back-to-back with their opponent and hooks both of the opponent's arms. They then lean forward and drop to their knees, sliding the opponent down their back so that their shoulders are against the mat and their chin is against their chest. The attacker holds the opponents arms down with their own arms for the pin.\n\nAlso known as a lateral press, cross press, or simply as the basic pin. With an opponent lying face-up on the mat, the attacking wrestler lies face-down across the opponent's chest to hold them down. Sometimes, when both wrestlers are exhausted or badly hurt the attacking wrestler will cover with just an arm or lie down face up rather than face down. The term \"floatover\" (when in reference to a pin) refers to an attacking wrestler using the momentum of a throw or slam they are performing to propel themselves over the opponent into the lateral press position. A variation commonly used by The Undertaker sees the wrestler cross the opponent's arms across their chest, similar to a corpse. This is sometimes called a \"Rest In Peace\" pin, though there is no official name.\n\nThe attacking wrestler lies across the opponents chest and hooks a leg with the arm on the opposite side (left leg with right arm or right leg with left arm). Holding the leg gives the attacker greater leverage and thus makes it harder for the opponent to kick out. This was derived from the inside cradle and outside cradle in amateur wrestling.\n\nAn attacking wrestler hooks the arms of an opponent, by grapevining their legs around one arm and their arms around the other. This positions the attacking wrestler horizontally across the back of the opponent and forces the opponent's arms out like a crucifixion. The attacking wrestler then lowers their bodyweight so that the opponent is brought down to the mat backwards and is forced on to his own shoulders in a pinning position with his legs in the air. \n\nA variation on the standard crucifix, the crucifix bomb or crucifix driver, sees an attacking wrestler violently force their bodyweight downwards to throw the opponent into the mat with greater impact.\n\nThe Delfin Clutch has an attacking wrestler crossing the arms of the opponent across their own chest while they're lying on their back on the mat. The attacking wrestler then kneels down on one knee on the opponent's arms, pinning the opponent's shoulders down to the mat. The attacking wrestler then grabs the opponent's legs, crosses them, and places them under one of their armpits, bending the opponent to a pinning predicament.\n\nThe Gannosuke Clutch has an attacking wrestler facing the opponent, grabbing their arm, twisting it into a modified hammerlock and then performing a front somersault while holding the trapped arm in place as well as legsweeping the opponent's near leg, rolling the opponent backwards while the attacking wrestler keeps the hammerlock applied while also holding the opponent's near leg down with their own leg. This move is also known as an arm trap somersault cradle. This was innovated and popularized by Mr. Gannosuke, who named it after himself.\n\nThe Gedo Clutch has an attacking wrestler sit kneeling on the back of an opponent who is lying face down and facing the same way. The attacking wrestler then grabs the opponent's arms and lifts them over their thighs, similar to a camel clutch. The attacker then grabs hold of the opponent's head and pushes it down and forward between his legs, while leaning himself forward onto his stomach, flipping the opponent over onto their shoulders, with the attackers legs pinning the opponent down to the mat. This hold is technically known as a double leg nelson. It was innovated by Gedo.\n\nThe hold has the opponent wrestler lying on their back. Standing at the feet of the opponent, the attacking wrestler then lifts the opponent's legs from behind the knees. Still gripping the opponent's legs, the attacking wrestler then flips forward, over the opponent, and plants their feet on the mat while bridging the back to add leverage.\n\nA variation of the jackknife hold, known as the figure four pin, has the attacker placing the opponent's legs in a figure four position before executing the bridge.\n\nAlso referred to as la casita or as bandito, this move's technical name is arm-wrench inside cradle pin and it is performed with the opponent on their hands and knees. From this position, the attacking wrestler stands next to the opponent's hip, grabs one arm and applies an armbar. The attacking wrestler then steps over the arm with his inside leg so that he is facing away from the opponent. The attacking wrestler continues his turning motion and dives forward over the opponent, rolling onto their side. The barred arm acts as a lever, flipping the opponent over the attacker and onto his back. The attacker hooks one or both legs as the opponent goes over and holds for the pin.\n\nNot to be confused with the O'Connor roll, which is a roll-up. The attacking wrestler stands to the side of his opponent, who is on his hands and knees. The attacker hooks one arm around the opponent's neck and one between the legs, and rolls over the opponent. The attacker lands on his back or side, and the opponent is flipped so that his shoulders are pressed against the mat.\n\nSimilar to a rana, except that the attacking wrestler is standing, bent over the opponent with both legs hooked pressing his weight down, it also exist of a variation with the attack wrestler bridging while the count is on. This pin is typically the result of a powerbomb.\n\nAlso known as the double leg cradle (from the original spanish \"rana\", meaning Frog), is the technical term for the pinning position which results from a sunset flip or a hurricanrana. \n\nIn the sunset flip version the opponent is lying shoulders down on the mat, almost completely flat on his back, with the attacking wrestler applying the pin sits below the legs of the opponent and uses his own legs to cover the opponent's shoulders or arms, and hooks both legs around the opponent's thighs to force his weight down to the mat.\n\nThe other variation, which usually results from a hurricanrana, sees the one performing the hurricanrana sit on the opponent's chest and hook the opponent's legs behind him whilst hooking the opponent's arms with his legs. This variation is the same hold just with the attacking wrestler on top. This interchangeability often sees a spot where the wrestlers change their weight distribution to move from one pinning hold to the other for a succession of near falls.\n\nNot to be confused with a schoolboy pin. The attacking wrestler holds their opponent from behind in a waistlock. The attacking wrestler then performs a backward roll while holding the waistlock. The opponent ends up on their shoulders with the attacking wrestler sitting on top of their legs holding the opponent down. This move is often done when the opponent is leaning on the ropes facing out of the ring and the attacking wrestler would first push forward into the ropes with the waistlock in order to generate faster backward motion. A common heel tactic is to grab the back of the opponents clothing or tights while sitting on top of them or to use the ropes for leverage, thus making the pin illegal.\n\nIt is sometimes called the O'Connor roll, after Pat O'Connor's usage of the move; but O'Connor himself dubbed the move a \"reverse rolling cradle\". Bob Backlund also performed this move and additionally bridged over the opponent at the end of the move.\n\nNot to be confused with a roll-up. The schoolboy sweep sees the attacking wrestler drop down behind the opponent and put one arm up between the opponent's legs to pull the opponent over the attacking wrestler so that they fall flat on their back. At this point, the attacking wrestler would stack the fallen opponent on their shoulders for the pin. Often when female wrestlers use this move, commentators will refer to it as a schoolgirl. An inverted version like the regular version instead lays sideways on the butt/thigh area in a form of a side bridge.\n\nThe attacking wrestler sits down with the legs of the opponent hooked over their shoulders so that the legs and lower body of the opponent are elevated while their shoulders and upper back are in contact with the mat. The arms of the opponent are sometimes pinned beneath the legs of the attacker. This hold results from numerous throws, including the sitout powerbomb, the spin-out powerbomb, and the sunset flip. Japanese wrestler, Manami Toyota, popularized a modified pin that usually ended on a sitout position; She called it the \"Manami Roll\".\n\nThe small package—or inside cradle—is a pinning maneuver where the attacking wrestler puts the opponent into a front face lock and pulls the opponent’s near arm over their head, like a suplex. Then, the attacking wrestler hooks their opponent’s far leg with he opposite leg and the opponent’s other leg with their hand. The attacker will then fall back, pinning the opponent.\n\nIn this pinning maneuver where the attacking wrestler has the opponent on his back and the attacking wrestler grabs both legs, puts them above the opponent’s head, jumps up in the air, opens his legs, and falls on the opponent’s legs trapping him into a pinning situation.\n\nIn this pinning technique, the attacking wrestler stands with their feet on either side of an opponent who is lying face-up on the mat. Then the attacker kneels across the opponent's chest facing their head, with each knee beside the chest. Sometimes the attacker sits on the opponent's chest for greater pressure. There is also a reverse variation in which the attacker is facing the opponent's feet. \n\nThe shoulder straddle pin is typical variation of the straddle pin. It sees the attacker kneeling on the opponent's shoulders facing the head, pinning them on the mat. In another variation, the attacker sits on the neck or face of the opponent with or without the knee on the shoulder. Primarily called a facesit, it is used mostly by heels or in mixed professional wrestling to demonstrate dominance and entertain the crowd.\n\nThis pin commonly sees an attacking wrestler dive over an opponent who is facing him/her, usually bent over forwards, catching the opponent in a waistlock from behind and landing back-first behind the opponent. From that position the wrestler rolls forward into a sitting position, pulling the opponent over backwards and down to the mat so that he lands on his back into a sitout pin position. While being held on the shoulders of an attacking wrestler in a position where this second wrestler is straddling the head of the attacking wrestler while facing in the other direction.\nOne variation is the split-legged (used by some known wrestlers like Alicia Fox and the retired Christy Hemme), in which a cornered wrestler as a counter to an oncoming opponent, jumps and splits his legs, sits in the top turnbuckle on a straddle position, then rolls forward to catch the opponent on a waist-lock to roll into a usual sunset flip.\n\nThe attacking wrestler jumps onto their opponent's shoulders from behind and rolls forward. As the attacker flips over, they hook the opponent's shoulders with their legs, flipping the opponent over onto their shoulders. The attacker hooks both of the opponent's legs to hold them in place for the pin.\n\nA slight variation of the victory roll, which sees the wrestler being wheelbarrowed by the opponent. The wrestler then \"counters\" the wheelbarrow by the opponent, flipping forward into a pin, with both of the opponent's legs hooked to complete the pin. The slight difference between the two variations is that the wrestler in the normal victory roll is over the opponent's shoulders, while in the wheelbarrow variation the wrestler is scissoring the opponent's body under the shoulders.\n\n\n"}

Sublanguages occur in natural language, computer language, and relational databases.\n\nIn Informatics, natural language processing, and machine translation, a sublanguage is the language of a restricted domain, particularly a technical domain. In mathematical terms, \"a subset of the sentences of a language forms a sublanguage of that language if it is closed under some operations of the language: e.g., if when two members of a subset are operated on, as by \"and\" or \"because\", the resultant is also a member of that subset\" (Z. S. Harris \"Language and Information\", Columbia U. Press, 1988, p. 34).\n\nThe term sublanguage has also sometimes been used to denote a computer language that is a subset of another language. A sublanguage may be restricted syntactically (it accepts a subgrammar of the original language), and/or semantically (the set of possible outcomes for any given program is a subset of the possible outcomes in the original language).\n\nFor instance, ALGOL 68S was a subset of ALGOL 68 designed to make it possible to write a single-pass compiler for this \"sublanguage\".\n\nSQL (Structured Query Language) statements are classified in various ways, which can be grouped into sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data definition language (DDL), a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML).\n\nIn relational database theory, the term \"sublanguage\", first used for this purpose by E. F. Codd in 1970, refers to a computer language used to define or manipulate the structure and contents of a relational database management system (RDBMS). Typical sublanguages associated with modern RDBMS's are QBE (Query by Example) and SQL (Structured Query Language). In 1985, Codd encapsulated his thinking in twelve rules which every database must satisfy in order to be truly relational. The fifth rule is known as the \"Comprehensive data sublanguage rule\", and states:\n\n"}

Vesaas is widely considered to be one of Norway's greatest writers of the twentieth century and perhaps its most important since World War II.\n\nVesaas was born in Vinje, Telemark, Norway. He was the oldest of three sons. He was guilt-ridden by his refusal to take over the family farm, and this guilt permeates much of his authorship. He spent much of his youth in solitude, seeking comfort and solace in nature. The destruction he witnessed after World War I also made a deep impression on him. He married the writer Halldis Moren Vesaas and moved to Midtbø in his home district of Vinje in 1934.\n\nHis authorship covers almost 50 years, from 1923 to 1970. Written in Nynorsk, his work is characterized by simple, terse, and symbolic prose. His stories are often about simple rural people that undergo a severe psychological drama and who according to critics are described with immense psychological insight. Commonly dealing with themes such as death, guilt, angst, and other deep and intractable human emotions, the Norwegian natural landscape is a prevalent feature in his works. His debut was in 1923 with \"Children of Humans\" (\"Menneskebonn\"), but he had his breakthrough in 1934 with \"The Great Cycle\" (\"Det store spelet\"). His mastery of the nynorsk language, \"landsmål\" (see Norwegian language), has contributed to its acceptance as a medium of world class literature.\n\nA prolific author, he won a number of awards, including the Gyldendal's Endowment in 1943 and Dobloug Prize in 1957. He was awarded the Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1963 for his novel \"The Ice Palace\" and the Venice Prize in 1953 for \"The Winds\". He was mentioned as being considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature on three separate occasions (1964, 1968 and 1969).\n\nThe most famous of his works are \"The Ice Palace (Is-slottet)\", a story of two girls who build a profoundly strong relationship, and \"The Birds (Fuglane)\", a story of an adult of a simple childish mind, which through his tenderhearted empathy and imagination bears the role of a seer or writer. His novels have been translated into 28 languages. Several of his books have been translated into English – many of them published by Peter Owen Publishers– among them \"Spring Night\", \"The Birds,\" \"Through Naked Branches,\" and \"The Ice Palace\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This quality of the voice is one of the major determining factors in voice classification within classical music. Lighter voices are often associated with the term \"lyric\" and are usually brighter and more agile; heavier voices are often associated with the term \"dramatic\" and are usually powerful, rich, and darker. Other voice types like the spinto have a more medium vocal weight. Vocal weight can also affect overall vocal agility; heavier voices often have more difficulty maneuvering through florid coloratura passages than their lighter counterparts, as their weight and power compromises agility. Likewise, dramatic roles are often written with larger orchestras in mind as dramatic voices can carry more easily over larger ensembles.\n"}
