It was named by German researchers after its first entry: \"abrogans = dheomodi\" (Modern German: \"demütig\" = modest, humble).\n\nOn several occasions the South Tyrolean bishop Arbeo of Freising († 783 or 784) or the Benedictine monk Kero are named as authors.\n\nThe German Abrogans is a Latin-Old High German thesaurus, which was not, however, produced from a collection of Latin-Old High German translations, but structured on a pure Latin, alphabetically sorted thesaurus. This Latin-Latin glossary, the Latin Abrogans, was probably compiled in Italy (possibly in the important southern Italian monastery Vivarium) of numerous older late-antiquity and early medieval glossaries. Thus arose a dictionary in which rare expressions, above all from biblical Latin, were explained.\n\nThe dictionary was likely finally translated into German in the second half of the 8th century in the old Bavarian bishopric Freising, which came under control of the bishop Arbeo (he was bishop here from 764 to 783). At the same time both the Latin key word and its Latin reproduction were entered with the Old High German equivalents. For example:\n\nThis was a process which around the middle of the 8th century many times had to lead to poor translations, for example lapsing into other parts of speech. Nevertheless, the Abrogans offers tremendous material for linguistics, which still today is not yet completely analyzed. So there are about 700 words that otherwise no longer appear in any other Old High German texts.\n\nNo specimens from the time of origin of the glossary in the 8th century have been saved. Only three younger Alemannic copies of the Bavarian document are preserved. The best, albeit mangled handwriting is the direct copy of the archetype that was made around 810 in Murbach for Charlemagne (Baesecke) or in Regensburg under Bishop Baturich (Bernhard Bischoff).

{"id": "254294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254294", "title": "Anacoluthon", "text": "Anacoluthon\n\nAn anacoluthon ( ; from the Greek \"anakolouthon\", from \"an-\": \"not\" and ἀκόλουθος \"akólouthos\": \"following\") is an unexpected discontinuity in the expression of ideas within a sentence, leading to a form of words in which there is logical incoherence of thought. Anacolutha are often sentences interrupted midway, where there is a change in the syntactical structure of the sentence and of intended meaning following the interruption. An example is the Italian proverb \"The good stuff – think about it.\" This proverb urges people to make the best choice. When anacoluthon occurs unintentionally it is considered to be an error in sentence structure, and results in incoherent nonsense. However, it can be used as a rhetorical technique to challenge the reader to think more deeply, or in \"stream of consciousness\" literature to represent the disjointed nature of associative thought. Anacoluthon is very common in informal speech, where a speaker might start to say one thing, then break off and abruptly and incoherently continue, expressing a completely different line of thought. When such speech is reported in writing, a dash (—) is often included at the point of discontinuity. The listener is expected to ignore the first part of the sentence, although in some cases it might contribute to the overall meaning in an impressionistic sense.\n\n\nIn Paradise Lost, John Milton uses an anacoluthon with Satan's first words to illustrate his initial confusion:\n\nWilliam Shakespeare uses anacoluthon in his history plays such as in this (\"Henry V\" IV iii 34-6):\n\nAdditionally, Conrad Aiken's \"Rimbaud and Verlaine\" has an extended anacoluthon as it discusses anacoluthon:\n\nFranz Kafka uses perhaps the most famed example of anacoluthon as the first line of The Metamorphosis:\n\"When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams, he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin.\"\n\nThe word \"anacoluthon\" is a transliteration of the Greek (\"anakólouthon\"), which derives from the privative prefix (\"an-\") and the root adjective (\"akólouthos\"), \"following\". This, incidentally, is precisely the meaning of the Latin phrase \"non sequitur\" in logic. However, in Classical rhetoric anacoluthon was used \"both\" for the logical error of \"non sequitur\" and for the syntactic effect or error of changing an expected following or completion to a new or improper one.\n\nThe term \"anacoluthon\" is used primarily within an academic context. It is most likely to appear in a study of rhetoric or poetry. For example \"The King's English\", an English style guide written by H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler, mentions it as a major grammatical mistake.\n\n\"We can hardly conclude even so desultory a survey of grammatical misdemeanours as this has been without mentioning the most notorious of all. The anacoluthon is a failure to follow on, an unconscious departure from the grammatical scheme with which a sentence was started, the getting switched off, imperceptibly to the writer, very noticeably to his readers, from one syntax track to another.\"\n\nThe term does occasionally appear in popular media as well. The word, though not the underlying meaning (see malapropism), has been popularized, due to its use as an expletive by Captain Haddock in the English translations of \"The Adventures of Tintin\" series of books.\n\n\n\n"}

It was his message to the Hindus to get out of their hypnotized state of mind.\n\nNachiketa, the child protagonist of Katha Upanishad, was sent to Yama, the Hindu god of death, by his father Vajashrava. In the abode of Yama, he answered Nachiketa's questions and taught him Self-knowledge and the methods of \"Yoga\". The words \"Arise, awake...\" can be found in the 1.3.14 chapter of the book, where Yama is advising Nachiketa—\n\nThe inspirational \"sloka\" was Swami Vivekananda's message to the Hindus to get out of their hypnotized state of mind. The \"sloka\" was meant as a call to his countrymen to awaken their \"sleeping soul\" and propagate the message of peace and blessings given by the \"ancient Mother\" to the world. \"Awake\" also denotes the awakening of one's real nature and the consequent ushering in of prosperity.\n\nOn 24 April 1897 Vivekananda wrote a letter to Sarala Ghoshal. In that letter he stressed giving the public only positive education, because of his belief that negative thoughts weaken men. In that letter, he also reiterated this \"sloka\".\n\nVivekananda quoted this \"sloka\" in several lectures and discourses. In a lecture delivered on 12 November 1896 at Lahore, he said:\nTherefore, young men of Lahore, raise once more that mighty banner of Advaita, for on no other ground can you have that wonderful love until you see that the same Lord is present everywhere. Unfurl that banner of love! \"Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.\" Arise, arise once more, for nothing can be done without renunciation.\n\nIn her essay \"Reminiscences of Swami Vivekananda\", Sister Christine wrote that Vivekananda wanted to see men striving to find the Supreme. She wrote:\n\n\"Arise\" was meant as a passionate call for national awakening to obtain political freedom for the country from colonialism, and to not to \"stop\" until the \"goal\" was achieved. This was essential in the social, economic and political fields. \"Arise\" was also intended to mean to get out of the state of helplessness. His emphasis was on freedom to the nation, as in the US on 4 July 1776. Swamiji also urged people to learn from Hindu sacred scriptures, which he felt contained all the instructions to arise out of the \"hypnotism of weakness\" and which indicated that no individual is inherently weak.\n\nThe 1998 film \"Swami Vivekananda\", directed by G. V. Iyer, ends with this quote where Mammootty gives a brief speech on Vivekananda and his ideals and concludes the speech with this quote. On 12 January 2013, on the 150 birth anniversary, then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and now prime minister of India, wrote a blog post on his personal website to pay tribute to Vivekananda. He named the post \"Commemorating Swami Vivekananda: Arise, Awake and stop not till the goal is reached\". The \"sloka\" is inscribed on the main stage of an auditorium of Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata, a branch of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. Dr. Sanjeev Kumar, an Indian author, called this a \"life-transforming line\" and wrote a book named \"Stop Not Till the Goal is Reached\" in 2010.\n\n\n\n"}

According to a 1944 report on same-sex prison rape, the term had taken on a more specific meaning of taking the penetrative role in anal sex. It was also popularized in part through use in gay culture.\n\nIn a similar context, a \"corn husk\" is a \"condom\", especially one manufactured for anal intercourse.\"\n\nAccording to linguist Jonathan Lighter, \"to cornhole\" and variant non-derived synonyms have developed as compound verbs: \"to corncob\" [1975] and \"to corndog\" [1985]. Linguists have noted the verb form as an example of possible compound verbs in English. There is debate whether such words are genuine compounds or pseudo-compounds.\n\nCornholio, the alter ego of Beavis from \"Beavis and Butt-head\", is a play on the word \"cornhole\", as his catch phrase is “I am the Great Cornholio!

The account, its author, and the character associated with the tweets are all commonly referred to as dril (the handle without the at sign) or wint (the account's display name), both rendered lowercase but often capitalized by others. Since his first tweet in 2008, dril has become a popular and influential Twitter user with more than one million followers.\n\ndril is one of the most notable accounts associated with \"Weird Twitter\", a subculture on the site that shares a surreal, ironic sense of humor. The character associated with dril is highly distinctive, often described as a bizarre reflection of a typical male American Internet user. dril's tweets are frequently satirical. Other social media users have repurposed dril's tweets for humorous or satiric effect in a variety of political and cultural contexts. Many of dril's tweets, phrases, and tropes have become familiar parts of Internet slang.\n\nThe author behind dril remained unknown for years, with the few available details about the author's life fueling speculation about his identity. In 2017, dril's author was \"doxxed\" (in other words, his identity was exposed) in a post that went viral and received media attention. After the doxxing, many Twitter users and journalists preferred to preserve dril's pseudonymity out of respect for the author's personal privacy and the character's mystique.\n\nBeyond tweeting, dril has created animated short films and contributed illustrations and writing to other artists' collaborative projects. dril's first book, \"Dril Official \"Mr. Ten Years\" Anniversary Collection\" (2018), is a compilation of the account's \"greatest hits\" alongside new illustrations. Writers have praised dril for the originality and humor of his tweets; for example, the poet Patricia Lockwood called dril \"a master of tone [and] character,\" and \"The A.V. Club\" dubbed him \"arguably the most iconic Twitter account in the history of social media.\"\n\nBefore the Twitter account, dril was a poster at the Something Awful forums under the name \"gigantic drill\". According to former Something Awful admin David Thorpe, dril was \"just a guy who was posting funny stuff on there,\" but never one of the site's featured front page writers. dril posted his first tweet—the single word \"no\"—on September 15, 2008.\n\ndril then remained silent on Twitter for nine months before his second tweet—\"how do i get cowboy paint off a dog .\"—and has posted regularly in the years since.\n\nInitially, little was known about the anonymous author of the dril account. When asked about the account's anonymity during a private Q&A in 2017, dril responded \"i am an almost 30 year old man and i could not really care less about the platform i use to convey dick jokes.\" Jacob Bakkila, one of the writers behind the @Horse_ebooks Twitter account, claimed in 2013 that dril had once hired him for a project. Bakkila told \"BuzzFeed\" that dril's author was a graphic designer living somewhere in the New York metropolitan tri-state area. \"BuzzFeed\"s John Herrman and Katie Notopoulos speculated that dril may be a collaborative project or that Bakkila himself was behind dril. Bakkila denied the rumor that he was dril, adding that dril was \"a friend\" who had contributed to the @Horse_ebooks sequel, \"Bear Stearns Bravo\". \n\nOn November 16, 2017, a Tumblr post identifying dril's author by his real name went viral. Other posts identifying dril's author existed as early as 2014 on Tumblr, Twitter, and Reddit, but these earlier posts had not gone viral or been publicized in the media. The 2017 post identified dril through \"informed guesswork\" founded on other clues, including a LinkedIn page associated with \"Bear Stearns Bravo\" and a writing credit on \"Hiveswap\", an adventure game set in the universe of Andrew Hussie's long-running webcomic \"Homestuck\".\n\nThe Tumblr post was described by the press as a \"doxing\": an unwelcome broadcasting of private personal information online. The post was met with backlash and dismay among Twitter users, many of whom voiced a preference for keeping dril's personal identity a mystery and preserving the author's privacy. According to Jozefien Wouters, writing for the Dutch news magazine \"Knack\": \n\nThe author addressed the doxing on his Patreon page, writing \"everything's normal. i guess im 'doxxed' now. sorry. it's fine. i donr really give a shit.\" In a Reddit \"ask us anything\" interview, dril confirmed that he had worked on \"Hiveswap\". He said the personal impact of the doxing had been minimal, adding that people had been \"surprisingly normal\" and he had no \"sordid past\" to hide, but also described being outed as \"my Cross to bear\" and said \"theres nothing scandalous enough there to make it worth publicizing and looking like an ass hole while doing so.\"\n\nThe author behind the @dril account writes in character. Generally understood to be male, dril's \"voice\" or \"character\" is strongly associated with the account's avatar, a blurry image of Jack Nicholson smiling and wearing sunglasses; writer Alexander Mcdonough called dril a \"grinning Jack Nicholson with severe persecution and self-esteem issues, poor physical health, and a bizarre love/hate relationship with cops.\" Bijan Stephen at \"The Verge\" likened dril to an online version of the \"wise fool\" stock character.\n\nCritics have described dril's voice as an amalgamation of ordinary Internet users, most of all those who are arrogant, ignorant, or hapless. According to \"The A.V. Club\"s Clayton Purdom, dril is a sort of patron saint of Internet users, or \"your uncle's search history come to life and filtered through a scabrous comic sensibility, and ... possibly the most popular, beloved man on the entire internet (after, maybe, The Rock).\" Will Shaw of \"The Oxford Student\" noted the familiarity of dril's \"naive appeals to moderation\" and \"flame war posturing,\" and said dril the character \"is the internet's collective id, given form,\" while the writer behind @dril is \"the internet equivalent of the Beowulf-poet; we may never know who he really is, but we recognise when he is being channelled.\" Christine Erickson at \"Mashable\" said dril's character was like \"a spambot equivalent to the kind of crazy that Clint Eastwood portrays.\" At \"Kotaku\", Gita Jackson called dril a \"joke account that also inadvertently catalogues ... every way to be mad online.\"\n\nIn a lecture given at the University of Pennsylvania, American poet Patricia Lockwood described dril as a literary alter ego of Twitter users and the Internet in general. Comparing the account's persona to Ignatius J. Reilly, the protagonist of John Kennedy Toole's novel \"A Confederacy of Dunces\" (1980), Lockwood cited dril as an example of new possibilities in first-person narrative that could be explored online. Lockwood said of dril:\n\nThere are several people whose voices on social media are often compared to dril's—the musician and actor Ice-T is one—but Donald Trump is likely the most common comparison. Commentators have frequently compared dril to Trump (and vice versa), particularly Trump's voice on Twitter and other social media platforms. \"Both,\" according to Purdom, \"are aging, endlessly aggrieved white men who seemingly do not understand core components of the internet, yet they perfectly embody its anonymous rage, its ability to turn people into lunatics being swarmed and eaten alive by enemies and trolls.\" \n\nIn a 2016 article for \"New York\" magazine, Brian Feldman argued that Trump should choose dril as his vice-presidential running mate—a position that was later filled by then-Governor of Indiana Mike Pence—because the writer perceived commonalities between dril's \"incoherent, libidinous, authoritarian comment-spam\" and Trump's own campaign tweeting. In a joke about Trump's use of social media, journalist and MSNBC host Chris Hayes said that protestors should yell at Trump to log off to \"see if they can get him to recreate that @dril tweet,\" a reference to the following:\n\nEve Peyser, in a \"Gizmodo\" article declaring the 2016 presidential election was \"the Weird Twitter election,\" had earlier compared the same dril tweet to the \"tone, structure and message\" of a Trump tweet. David Covucci at \"The Daily Dot\" coined \"Dril's Law\", an adage stating that \"[f]or every single thing Donald Trump has tweeted, Dril did it earlier and better.\" Covucci also asked: \"What if Donald Trump is @dril? Would it be any stranger than Donald Trump being president of the United States?\" Responding to Covucci's question, Anna North wrote in \"The New York Times\" that \"another explanation\" for the similarity between dril and Trump \"seems more likely: Donald Trump's Twitter presence isn't absurdist, it's just absurd.\"\n\ndril's tweets are, in the words of Jordan Sargent at \"Gawker\", a series of \"quietly seething and unhinged avant-garde scribblings.\" His tweets are deliberately peppered with odd typos like misspelled words, grammatical mistakes, punctuation errors, and eggcorns. In the preface to his first book, dril called his writing style \"Prestige Short Prose\". \"Vice\" writer Rachel Pick noted the phrase was likely \"meant to make fun of the snobby lit theory types who want to make Dril out to be some highbrow art project,\" but she concluded it was an apt term to describe dril's style of \"part art form, part jokes to read on the toilet.\" Pick also compared dril's writing to the surreal one-liner jokes of Jack Handey and the flash fiction short story \"\". Jonah Engel Bromwich, in \"The New York Times\", said dril was a major influence on the spread of dialogue, written in the same method as screenwriting, as a comedic writing style on Twitter.\n\ndril has been identified as one of the \"most revered\" and \"quintessential\" accounts associated with the \"Weird Twitter\" scene, a loose subculture of associated users who share a surreal, ironic, subversive sense of humor. dril was one of many Weird Twitter personalities who migrated to Twitter from Something Awful's FYAD board and carried over the forum's in-jokes and tone. Like others on Weird Twitter, dril's tweets have been described as having a dadaist sensibility. Writing for \"Complex\", Brenden Gallagher compared dril to a musician who refuses to sell out or an auteurist indie filmmaker, as Twitter's version of \"the enigmatic figure that even [an art form's] best known practitioners look to with reverence.\" Sean T. Collins described dril's humor as a \"blend of fist-on-the-table bluster, abject confusion and burned-toast syntax,\" noting the influence of surreal humor found in Monty Python (especially the sketches from their show \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" and Terry Gilliam's animations) and Adult Swim shows like \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" and \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\" Collins called dril's tweets \"a new way to be funny, with a rhythm and vocabulary all their own. I love it.\"\n\nMost of dril's writing is understood to be absurd, surreal, ironic, or nonsensical. Yohann Koshy in \"Vice\" said dril's writing \"reads like obscene nonsense verse—the syntax mutilated, the humour irredeemable.\" An article about dril in \"The Oxford Student\" singled out this 2011 dril tweet as the account's guiding \"manifesto\":\n\nProviding a (supposedly) out-of-character statement to \"BuzzFeed\" for an oral history on \"Weird Twitter,\" dril commented on the nature of his work and motivation:\n\nDan Hitchens at Christian journal \"First Things\" noted, in an article about the use of irony on social media, that \"[m]uch of the art of Twitter consists in appearing to put forward a position while giving the impression that you might be kidding,\" citing American author David Foster Wallace's warnings about the pervasiveness of irony in modern culture. According to Hitchens, dril is the \"cult account that towers above the rest\" in his mastery of irony, and dril's \"inspired errors in spelling, logic, and decorum can only be produced by a clever creator, but the creator never lets the mask slip. Half the joke is our joint awareness of @dril's lack of self-awareness.\"\n\nAlthough dril's content is typically absurd or nonsensical, some have noted an undercurrent of satire or social commentary in dril's tweets. Surveying Weird Twitter for \"Complex\", Gallagher commented that dril's \"vicious satire of conservatives, gamers, conspiracy theorists, and other less savory aspects of the Internet is always on point, always hilarious, always in character.\" Fellow Weird Twitter user @rare_basement said dril's \"trolling [of] Penn State fans during the molestation scandal was so brilliant, always on the right side of the issue, but super funny and subtle about it.\" Although dril does not avow an explicit political identity, the account's politics are generally identified as leftist, an alignment common among Weird Twitter users. However, the abstraction and vagueness of dril's tweets have allowed them to be spread and repurposed by people of varying ideologies across the political spectrum. Celebrities, journalists, and former members of both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations follow dril, and even the far-right \"Breitbart News\" has quoted dril on its Twitter feed.\n\nReferences to dril's tweets have become part of the vernacular of Internet slang. Some of dril's distinctive phrases have become so ubiquitous that they are used even by those who are unaware of the phrases' origin. Although dril's biggest influence is on Twitter, his tweets are also popular on other social media platforms—for example, meme-aggregating groups on Facebook commonly share his content, and several Tumblr users and trends have referenced and been influenced by dril. There was a \"Know Your Meme\" guide to dril in 2014, at a time when \"KYM\" pages for individual Twitter users would have been comparatively rare.\n\nA common piece of conventional wisdom on Twitter holds that it's possible to find a dril tweet that corresponds to virtually any situation or statement. As an example, the dril tweet below has been widely referenced after a person apologizes for making a dramatically offensive and obviously incorrect statement: \n\nAs described by Purdom, finding the dril tweet that matches an event or statement has become an online parlor game, made possible because dril had \"rendered a tightly written comedic exaggeration of every daily outrage and conflict from the news cycle in which we find ourselves trapped.\" Purdom also found that dril's early preoccupations and sensibility had an outsized, \"Velvet Underground-like influence on the tenor of the internet to come.\" By the end of 2017, the staff of \"Deadspin\" declared that \"comparing everything to @dril\" was a trend that \"should die\" in 2018, asserting that dril himself remained funny but dril comparisons had become an overused, lazy trope, because too many Twitter users were relying on dril references \"as a substitute for an actual joke.\"\n\nOther social media users frequently quote, recontextualize, or remix dril tweets for their own satirical purposes, and some accounts are even exclusively dedicated to this purpose. One such account, @EveryoneIsDril, shares screenshots of tweets by other people that sound like dril's voice. Another, \"wint MP\" or @parliawint, attaches dril tweets styled like teletext closed captions to images from BBC News of British politicians and journalists speaking. Although seemingly niche, the wint MP account garnered 14,000 followers by May 2017. Tom Dissonance, the creator of wint MP, attributed the account's success to its functioning as a joke on multiple levels, and for multiple audiences: \"there are people who get the in-jokey references; there's a broader level of people who get politics and dril, and understand the significance of one commenting on another; and beyond that there are people who just appreciate an official figure in a suit saying something ridiculous. It's an onion of silliness.\" Koshy commented that wint MP \"stands out from traditional forms of satire because it has no normative force. It recommends nothing about the way things should be. The political field it presents is slack-jawed, demented, putrid and amoral – there is no value beyond the scope of its image.\" According to Shaw in \"The Oxford Student\", the absurd political atmosphere of the mid to late 2010s made it \"the Age of Dril\":\n\nNot all satirical riffing on dril is political in nature; for example, the account @drilmagic attracted thousands of followers presenting mashups of dril tweets and cards from the game \"\". Ben Wilinofsky, a card player who contributed to @drilmagic, said the account and its format became a success because \"\"Magic\" has a very self-serious lore that is great foil for an account that so often has the self-serious in its crosshairs.\"\n\nIn 2011, dril tweeted the following:\n\nThe tweet describes an argument or similar situation in which one participant has clearly been \"owned\" but refuses to acknowledge it or to take a break, instead doubling down and insisting beyond any credibility that they have not been owned. \n\nShortly after it was posted, Twitter users began to use screenshots of the corncob tweet to point out when a person refused to acknowledge losing an argument or suffering some other humiliation. By 2017, the word \"corncob\" by itself had become common slang on Twitter for this purpose. \"The Ringer\"s Kate Knibbs observed that, while \"corncob\" as slang remained limited to communities on Twitter, the \"corncob\" archetype is universal and identifiable throughout contemporary culture. According to Knibbs, \"the \"condition\" of being a corn cob—of allowing yourself to be defined by and reduced to a piercing insistence that a perceived slight has not diminished you—[has] spread far beyond a small corner of Twitter.\" Among public figures whose recent behavior fit the \"corncob\" archetype, Knibbs listed Donald Trump, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, actress Louise Linton, Kim Kardashian's friend Jonathan Cheban, Kanye West (noting his numerous outbursts and 2016 song \"Famous\"), and Taylor Swift (noting her 2017 song \"Look What You Made Me Do\").\n\nThe term \"corncob\" became controversial after the reference was used in a meme with leftist criticisms of Kamala Harris, a Democrat and Californian Senator who is widely believed to be a 2020 presidential contender. The political commentator Al Giordano incorrectly asserted, citing a dated Urban Dictionary definition of \"corncobbed,\" that \"[e]very cretin who has spread this meme needs to reckon with how it uses 'corncob,' a rape culture and homophobic term popular among dudebros.\" Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and an advisor on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, called on a Twitter user—an Ohio State student—to \"denounce\" the corncob meme. Various news publications reported on the story, and noted that the fast pace of Twitter discourse and unusual slang and in-jokes meant that a misunderstanding — or failure to properly look up a term — risked embarrassment and mocking for prominent Twitter users like Giordano and Tanden; Amelia Tait, writer of an \"internet dictionary\" column in the \"New Statesman\", even wrote that Giordano had \"exposed [himself] as ignorant of online culture\" and had, himself, been corncobbed.\n\ndril tweets often riff on his relationships with family members—particularly an unnamed wife, ex-wife, and multiple sons—in a manner reminiscent of father figures in American sitcoms like \"Married… With Children\". Jia Tolentino, a staff writer for \"The New Yorker\", credited dril as an originator of the \"large adult son\" trope. The trope, which Tolentino described as commonplace across social media and especially online sports journalism, involves particular observations of hapless male behavior that is \"endlessly excusable: though [the large adult son] does nothing right, he can do no wrong.\" The character of dril repeatedly refers to his \"sons,\" who are usually involved in the kind of \"classic large-adult-son behavior\" Tolentino describes as \"alarming, with a whiff of the surreal.\" The sons are compared to Trump's sons, particularly Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Mike Huckabee's sons.\n\nIn June 2016, dril drew controversy for a tweet that used triple parentheses around the name of the corporate mascots of the cookie company Keebler:\n\nTriple parentheses, or \"echoes,\" are used online by the alt-right as an antisemitic symbol to highlight the names of Jews. Journalist Jay Hathaway wrote that most of dril's followers understood the tweet to be an ironic joke exploring the uncertain \"etiquette around this very 2016 expression of bigotry ... Can a non-Jew apply the (((echoes))) to his own name as a show of allyship? Is it OK to use the parentheses in a joke at the white supremacists' expense? There’s no clear consensus.\"\n\nAs the \"(((Keebler Elves)))\" tweet spread, some far-right accounts praised dril, interpreting the tweet as a covert signal of genuine antisemitic views. Others criticized the tweet as bigoted, even if the intent was ironic, or at least in poor taste. In response to the controversy, dril alternated between dismissing those who believed he was a Nazi and making sarcastic promises to become \"less racist\" with the help of donations. Writer Alexander Mcdonough said dril's \"refusal to clarify his views speaks to his trust in his audience to 'get' his jokes\" and to dril's confidence in his privacy. \"Likewise,\" Mcdonough wrote, \"[dril's] audience trusts him to make pointed satire that crosses boundaries but is never hateful. The joke is always on himself or an entrenched elite, dril never punches down.\" According to Mcdonough, the controversy did not seem to have any long-term impact on dril's popularity. In the Jewish magazine \"Tablet\", Armin Rosen called the tweet \"an obviously satirical performance of anti-Jewish bigotry\" and \"the only funny anti-Semitism meta-controversy in the history of the internet.\"\n\nIn addition to his tweets, dril has many visual art side projects and collaborations with other artists. dril has made several animations, including a short film titled \"COW-BOY\" and a fictional series about the attempts of \"South Park\" creator Trey Parker and Green Day drummer Tré Cool to rename the month of April \"Treypril/Trépril\" and \"one policeman's mission to stop them at any cost.\" dril has expressed interest in creating further animated films, but said he would prefer to work on projects separate from his \"dril\" identity.\n\ndril worked on \"Bear Stearns Bravo\", an interactive video series that was the sequel to the Horse_ebooks Twitter account. For the November 2014 issue \"Paper\" magazine, which famously featured Kim Kardashian on the cover, dril contributed an article on how to \"break the Internet\". dril designed the cover of the 2016 vaporwave/funk album \"Cyber-Vision\" by Drew Fairweather (\"Drew Toothpaste\"), best known for the webcomics \"Toothpaste for Dinner\" and \"Married to the Sea\". dril wrote for \"Hiveswap\", a 2017 video game based on the webcomic \"Homestuck\". \"Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff and the Quest for the Missing Spoon\", a book based on a story within a story in \"Homestuck\", lists dril as a contributing author and artist alongside \"Homestuck\" creator Andrew Hussie and \"Gunshow\" author KC Green. dril was one of several artists who contributed illustrations for the card game \"The Devil's Level\", based on the Twitter account da share z0ne.\n\nIn January 2017, dril opened a Patreon account for fans to make monthly payments in support of his tweets and various future projects, including \"video, illustration, and long-form writing.\" On the Patreon, dril described his plans for two book projects: an elaborate art book \"with a narrative adjacent to the 'Mythos' surrounding my posts\" and a \"best of\"-style compilation of tweets as a coffee table book with bonus content. By October 2017, dril's Patreon received $2,200 a month from fans.\n\ndril published his first book, \"Dril Official \"Mr. Ten Years\" Anniversary Collection\", in August 2018. The book compiles the account's best tweets from its first ten years, as selected by the author, along with new original illustrations. dril's second book is due for release in early 2019.\n\nOver time, dril has grown from a relatively obscure Twitter account with a small cult following to a widely followed, well-known account on the site. In October 2012, dril had only 23,000 followers. By December 2014, that number had grown to 166,000, and then 567,000 by May 2017. On January 10, 2018, dril hit one million followers. Unlike most comedians with large Twitter followings, dril became popular without a public reputation or career outside of the platform.\n\nFollowing dril has often been described—sometimes in a half-serious or tongue-in-cheek manner, other times sincerely—as one of the few good uses of Twitter. In November 2017, shortly after the doxing incident, dril was called \"arguably the most iconic Twitter account in the history of social media [and] practically internet royalty\" in \"The A.V. Club\" and \"one of the internet's most unlikely treasures\" in \"Slate\".\n\ndril's writing has been praised by a variety of public figures, including poet Patricia Lockwood; comedian and actor Rob Delaney; writer and \"Chapo Trap House\" host Virgil Texas; \"The New Yorker\" staff writer Adrian Chen; and \"Reply All\" hosts PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman. In her 2017 book \"I Love My Computer Because My Friends Live in It: Stories from an Online Life\", author Jess Kimball Leslie described dril as a \"true genius of the Internet ... who's seemingly co-opted part of the human meme that is Jack Nicholson and mixed it with postmodernism and acid,\" and called the account's tweets \"nothing short of miracles.\"\n\ndril is frequently listed among the funniest or best Twitter accounts. In 2012, \"The Daily Dot\" cited dril as one of the funniest accounts on Twitter and noted that reading dril's \"[d]arkly funny ... odd, provocative, and clever\" tweets \"simultaneously brings a sense of head-scratching wonder and slightly uncomfortable chortles.\" Max Read, then an editor of \"Gawker\", named dril one of the publication's \"heroes\" of 2013 in a year-in-review piece. According to Read, dril's writing stood out in a paranoid web landscape overrun by spambots and covert corporate marketing:\n\n\"Paste\" included dril on its lists of best Twitter accounts every year between 2013 and 2016, and the comedy site \"Splitsider\" (later merged into \"Vulture\") named dril one of the funniest accounts of 2017.\n\nIndividual dril tweets have also been lauded by the press. At the occasion of Twitter's tenth anniversary, both \"GQ\" and \"Newsweek\" named this dril tweet among the best or funniest tweets of all time:\n\nThe same tweet was listed among the funniest by \"BuzzFeed\" in 2014. The \"corncob\" tweet was listed as the 8th most \"canonical\" tweet of all time in 2017 by \"Mic\", whose Miles Klee wrote it was \"categorically impossible\" to select the single best dril tweet. Another dril tweet—\"IF THE ZOO BANS ME FOR HOLLERING AT THE ANIMALS I WILL FACE GOD AND WALK BACKWARDS INTO HELL\"—was ranked among the site's \"greatest\" by \"Thought Catalog\" in 2013. In 2017, \"Slate\" counted a dril tweet among that year's best sentences, sitting alongside writers such as Umberto Eco, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Anne Carson, Mohsin Hamid, Jennifer Egan, Durga Chew-Bose, John Darnielle, and Daniel Dennett.\n\ndril online:\n\nCollections of dril's best tweets:\n"}

Writing solely in the Yoruba language, he captivated the symbolic spirit of Yoruba mythologies in his plays, which were later adapted to other media such as photography, television and cinema. His most famous play, \"Ọba kò so\" (The King did not Hang), a dramatization of the traditional Yoruba story of how Ṣango became the Orisha of Thunder, received international acclaim at the first Commonwealth Arts Festival in 1965 and on a European tour, where a Berlin critic, Ulli Beier, compared Ladipọ to Karajan. Ladipo usually acted in his own plays.\n\nDuro Ladipo was raised in a Christian family. His father was a minister at an Anglican church in Oṣogbo. However, Ladipo may have been influenced by his grandfather, who migrated to Oṣogbo after the Jalumi war. His grandfather was well versed in Yoruba mythology, especially those emanating from Old Ọyọ, and was known to have worshipped Ṣango and Ọya.\n\nLadipọ tried hard and succeeded in exposing himself to traditional and Yoruba cultural elements, especially when living under the veil of a Christian home. At a young age, he would sneak out of the vicarage to watch Yoruba festivals. This fascination with his culture goaded him into researching and experimenting with theatrical drama and writing. After leaving Oṣogbo, he went to Ibadan, where he became a teacher. While in Ibadan he became one of the founding members of an artist club called Mbari Mbayo and became influenced by Beier. He later replicated the club in Oṣogbo, and it became the premier group for promoting budding artists and dramatists in Oṣogbo. Throughout his career, Duro Ladipọ wrote ten Yoruba folk operas combining dance, music, mime, proverbs, drumming and praise songs.\n\nLadipo started his personal theatre group in 1961, but he became fully established with the founding of the Mbari Mbayo Club in Oṣogbo. His popularity as the leader of a folk opera group rests on his three plays: Ọ\"bamoro\" in 1962, Ọ\"ba ko so\" and Ọ\"ba Waja\" in 1964. (Ọ\"ba Waja\" - \"The King is Dead\" - is based on the same historical event that inspired fellow Nigerian playwright Wọle Ṣoyinka's \"Death and the King's Horseman\".) He also promoted \"Mọremi\", a play about the Yoruba ancestress of the same name. He later transformed Mbari Mbayo into a cultural center, an arts gallery and a meeting point for young artists seeking to develop their talents. Duro Ladipọ wrote quite a number of plays, such as \"Suru Baba Iwa\" and \"Tanimowo Iku.\" Some of his plays were also produced for television. In fact, he created \"Bode Wasinimi\" for the Nigerian Television Authority, Ibadan.\n\nIn 1977, Duro Ladipo participated in Festac '77, the second world Festival of Black and African Arts and Culture, in Lagos, Nigeria.\n"}

They are known for their participation in gay pride events such as Pride parades, and significant LGBT events like the international Gay Games.\n\nThey most likely were originally put at the front of the parade for logistical reasons and have remained there as a symbol of LGBT pride, defiance, liberation and empowerment. The contingents are fiercely independent and self-reliant in the DIY and feminist traditions and have been studied as a social phenomenon as a \"complex, multilayered form of consumption-related cultural resistance that raises awareness of social injustice and discursively informs social meanings in everyday life outside the festivals.\"\n\nAlong with drag queens, the DOB have been criticized for not portraying a more acceptable image of LGBT culture but supporters counter that they are seen as highly visible icons of gay pride who refuse to assimilate and conform to mainstream society gender roles and indeed remind of the butches and queens who helped lead the Stonewall riots launching the modern gay-rights movement.\n\nThe Dykes on Bikes have been criticized for using the term \"dyke\" in their name rather than lesbian but the group has registered the mark in the United States, after a battle to demonstrate that the terms \"diesel-dyke,\" \"bull-dyke,\" \"bull-dagger\" and dyke all have historically negative connotations but have been re-appropriated as self-referential terms of endearment and empowerment distinct from \"lesbian\" and indeed awards and events utilizing those names are now used by the LGBT community. In keeping with the tradition of motorcyclists' rejection of the norms of middle-class, middle-America, the Dykes on Bikes teach, by example, that women can be masculine and challenge the dominant sexual and cultural expectations of what a woman is and what she can do and achieve.\n\nAlthough the term specifically was coined by actual dykes on bikes at the first gathering at the 1976 San Francisco Pride parade, it could have been used prior to then, but came into formal use at that time. Dykes and motorcycles have been regularly intertwined in lesbian fiction and the term is sometimes used derogatorily against any woman rider who isn't with a man.\n\nAccording to Harley-Davidson historians female riders did everything men did from long distance riding to enjoying lazy Sunday afternoon rides with friends.\n\nAs the US entered World War II in 1941, women were provided opportunities to volunteer for their country and almost 250,000 women served in the armed forces, mostly in the Women's Army Corps (WAC), two-thirds of whom were single and under the age of twenty-five. Women were recruited with posters showing muscular, short-haired women wearing tight-fitting tailored uniforms. Bessie Stringfield, a pioneer African-American female motorcyclist, joined a motorcycle dispatch unit of the army.\n\nMany lesbians joined the WAC to meet other women and to do \"men's work.\" Few were rejected for lesbianism, and found that being strong or having masculine appearance – characteristics associated with being dykes – aided in the work as mechanics and motor vehicle operators. A popular Fleischmann's Yeast advertisement showed a WAC riding a motorcycle with the heading \"This is no time to be frail.\" Some recruits appeared at their inductions wearing men's clothing and their hair slicked back in the classic butch style of out lesbians of the time.\n\nThe first formal appearance of the Dykes on Bikes was in 1976 at San Francisco's Pride parade where the riders were placed first as motorcycles don't always run reliably at the walking pace of the rest of the parade and as first contingent they can move faster. Although the original group self-identified as \"Dykes on Bikes\" and they were known as such, over the years they used \"the Women’s Motorcycle Contingent/ Dykes on Bikes\" to encompass those who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or any of the newer gender-bending terms like femme, androgyne and boi. \n\nFounding member Soni Wolf was to be the Community Grand Marshal during the San Francisco Pride parade in 2018. Unfortunately, Wolf passed away in April 2018. Her close friends will represent her in the 2018 parade by carrying the custom-painted motorcycle tank from the bike she rode during the inaugural ride in 1976.\n\nDykes on Bikes have been leading marches such as Gay pride parades, Gay Games events and protests. \"Dyke Marches\" have become a popular Pride event nationwide with the Dykes on Bikes often leading the marches. The Dyke March events are generally non-commercial, often in sharp contrast to corporate-sponsored pride events, and are usually inclusive of lesbian, bi, and trans women. Leading pride parades around the world from San Francisco to Melbourne, Paris, London, Tokyo, Toronto, Vancouver, Sydney, Zurich, Tel Aviv, and Greece.\n\nNormally the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), under Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act, will not consider registration of a proposed trademark which contains a term that is disparaging to a group of people. This presents a problem for the PTO when an attempt is made by a group to register a mark containing a self-disparaging term, as was done with DOB. \"On February 20, 2004, the PTO refused the registration of the mark 'Dykes on Bikes' under Trademark Act Section 2(a), explaining that a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities would recognize that the term “dyke” is disparaging and objectionable to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities.\"\n\nOn November 13, 2006, the Dykes on Bikes won the battle to trademark the name, having struggled since 2003 to persuade the PTO that \"dyke\" was not offensive to the lesbian community. In 2005, after a prolonged court battle involving testimony on the word's changing role in the lesbian community, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board permitted the group to register its name. \n\nThe defense noted that during the time period from 2000 to 2005 the PTO had approved marks for \"Crippled Old Biker Bastards\", \"Biker Bitch\", \"Whore\", and \"Evil Pussy\" as well as \"TechnoDyke\", \"Homo Depot\", \"Queer Shop\", \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" and \"Queer as Folk\". The Brooke Oliver Law Office that represented the SFWMC also pointed out the absurdity of the initial rejection ruling citing the PTO's own regulations that \"the perceptions of the general public are irrelevant\" and indeed the test of \"whether a mark is disparaging and/or offensive is the perceptions of the individuals referred to and/or identified by that mark. In this particular case, it is women – or more specifically lesbians, bisexuals and transgender women – who ride motorcycles in the Pride Parades and who would be using the term.\"\n\nIn 2007, the club won a legal challenge from a male lawyer, Michael McDermott, who sued after the USPTO granted approval calling the name \"disparaging to men\" and \"scandalous and immoral.\" The court found that men had no grounds to be offended by the term. McDermott stated his opposition against any group associated with the annual Dyke March, which he dubbed \"the Annual Illegal San Francisco Dyke Hate Riot\" in which he and all men are subject to criminal attacks and civil right violations. He claimed the word dyke is associated with a \"deep obsessive hatred of men and the male gender.\"\n\nIn June 2014, the San Francisco Dykes on Bikes Women's Motorcycle Contingent was filmed for an episode of Sense8 during Dyke March.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1136404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1136404", "title": "Final-obstruent devoicing", "text": "Final-obstruent devoicing\n\nFinal-obstruent devoicing or terminal devoicing is a systematic phonological process occurring in languages such as Catalan, German, Dutch, Breton, Russian, Turkish, and Wolof. In such languages, voiced obstruents become voiceless before voiceless consonants and in pausa.\n\nIn Dutch and Afrikaans, terminal devoicing results in homophones such as 'hard' and 'heart' as well as differences in consonant sounds between the singular and plural forms of nouns, for example (Dutch) and (Afrikaans) for 'wave–waves'.\n\nThe history of the devoicing phenomenon within the West Germanic languages is not entirely clear, but the discovery of a runic inscription from the early fifth century suggests that this terminal devoicing originated in Frankish. Of the old West Germanic languages, Old Dutch, a descendant of Frankish, is the earliest to show any kind of devoicing, and final devoicing also occurred in Frankish-influenced Old French.\n\nEnglish does not have phonological final-obstruent devoicing of the type that neutralizes phonemic contrasts; thus pairs like \"bad\" and \"bat\" are distinct in all major accents of English. Nevertheless, voiced obstruents are devoiced to some extent in final position in English, especially when phrase-final or when followed by a voiceless consonant (for example, \"bad cat\" ).\n\nOld English had final devoicing of , although the spelling did not distinguish and . It can be inferred from the modern pronunciation of \"half\" with a voiceless , from an originally voiced fricative in Proto-Germanic (preserved in German and Gothic ). There was also final devoicing of to finally, evidenced by spellings like alongside .\n\nFinal-obstruents devoicing occurs in the varieties from Northern Germany.\nThe German contrast between homorganic obstruents is more properly described as a fortis and lenis opposition than an opposition of voiceless and voiced sounds. Therefore, the term \"devoicing\" may be misleading, since voice is only an optional feature of German lenis obstruents. By contrast, the German term for the phenomenon, (\"final-sound hardening\"), refers to fortition rather than devoicing. However, the German phenomenon is similar to the final devoicing in other languages in that the opposition between two different kinds of obstruents disappears at the ends of words, making homophones of such pairs as (\"wheel\") and (\"council, counsel\"), both pronounced . The German varieties of the north, and many pronunciations of Standard German, optionally involve voice in the distinction between fortis and lenis obstruents however.\n\nSome examples from Northern German include:\nFinal-obstruent devoicing can lead to the neutralization of phonemic contrasts in certain environments. For example, Russian ('demon', phonemically ) and ('without', phonemically ) are pronounced identically in isolation as .\n\nThe presence of this process in Russian is also the source of the seemingly variant transliterations of Russian names into \"-off\" (Russian: ), especially by the French, as well as older English transcriptions.\n\nIn compounds, the behavior varies between languages:\n\nMost modern continental West Germanic languages developed final devoicing, the earliest evidence appearing in Old Dutch around the 9th or 10th century. However, Yiddish notably does not alter final voiced sounds; this appears to be a later reversal.\n\n\nOf the North Germanic languages, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish (the latter of which has no voiced obstruents) do not have final devoicing. As in Danish, Icelandic stops are voiceless, but it has voiced fricatives which may also occur word-finally.\n\nGothic (an East Germanic language) also developed final devoicing independently.\n\nAmong the Romance languages, word-final devoicing is common in the Gallo-Romance languages, which tend to exhibit strong Frankish influence (itself the ancestor of Old Dutch, above).\n\nRomanian does \"not\" have it. Other Romance languages such as and French and Italian rarely have words with final voiced consonants, but borrowings from English into French or Italian that have a voiced final consonant (such as \"weekend\") are not devoiced either.\n\nMost Slavic languages exhibit final devoicing, but notably standard (Štokavian) Serbo-Croatian and Ukrainian do not.\n\n\nNote: Hungarian, which lies geographically between Germanic and Slavic languages, does \"not\" have it. Terminal devoicing is indicated in the orthography in Turkish, but it isn't in Azeri (i.e. the personal name would be spelled in Turkish, but in Azeri).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6891560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6891560", "title": "Günther Anders", "text": "Günther Anders\n\nGünther Anders (born Günther Siegmund Stern; Breslau, 12 July 1902 – Vienna, 17 December 1992) was a German Jewish philosopher, journalist, essayist and poet. \n\nTrained in the phenomenological tradition, he developed a philosophical anthropology for the age of technology, focusing on such themes as the effects of mass media on our emotional and ethical existence, the illogic of religion, the nuclear threat, the Shoah, and the question of being a philosopher. \n\nIn 1992, shortly before his death, Günther Anders was awarded the Sigmund Freud Prize.\n\nAt the time of his birth his native Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland) had become the 6th largest city in the German Empire, with a Jewish population of about 20,000, 5% of the city's population. He was the son of founders of child psychology Clara and William Stern as well as a cousin of Walter Benjamin. Anders was married three times, to the German philosopher and political scientist Hannah Arendt from 1929 to 1937, to the Austrian writer Elisabeth Freundlich from 1945 to 1955, and to American pianist Charlotte Lois Zelka in 1957. Zelka was born in California in 1930, toured Europe for two decades, and died of lung cancer in 2001.\n\nIn 1923 Anders obtained a PhD in philosophy; Edmund Husserl was his dissertation advisor. Anders' sister Hilde Stern was at one time married to the German philosopher Rudolf Schottlaender, who was also a student of Husserl. However Anders' own father was arguably the most significant intellectual influence in his life.\n\nWhile he was working as a journalist in Berlin, an editor did not want so many Jewish-sounding bylines in his paper, so Stern chose the name \"Anders\" (meaning other or different). He used that nom-de-plume for the rest of his life.\n\nIn the late 1920s Anders studied with the philosopher Martin Heidegger in Freiburg. He married fellow Heidegger student Hannah Arendt, who had engaged in an affair with their common mentor. Anders fled Nazi Germany in 1933, first to France (where he and Arendt divorced amicably in 1937), and later to the United States.\n\nAnders returned to Europe in 1950 with his second wife Elisabeth Freundlich (1906-2001), whom he had met in New York, to live in her native Vienna. There Anders wrote his main philosophical work, whose title translates as \"The Obsolescence of Humankind\" (1956), became a leading figure in the anti-nuclear movement, and published numerous essays and expanded versions of his diaries, including one of a trip to Breslau and Auschwitz with his wife. Anders' papers are held by the University of Vienna, and his literary executor is former FORVM editor Gerhard Oberschlick.\n\nAnders was an atheist.\n\nGünther Anders was an early critic of the role of technology in modern life and in this context was a trenchant critic of the role of television. His essay \"The Phantom World of TV,\" written in the late 1950s, was published in an edition of Bernard Rosenberg and David Manning White's influential anthology \"Mass Culture\" as \"The Phantom World of Television.\" In it he details how the televisual experience substitutes images for experience, leading people to eschew first-hand experiences in the world and instead become \"voyeurs,\" His dominant metaphor in this essay centers on how television interposes itself between family members \"at the dinner table.\" See \"Die Welt als Phantom und Matrize. Philosophische Betrachtungen über Rundfunk und Fernsehen\" (The World as Phantom and Matrix. Philosophical Observations on Radio and Television) (1956).\n\nHis major work, of which only a few essays have been translated into English, is acknowledged to be \"Die Antiquiertheit des Menschen\" (literally \"The Outdatedness of the Human Species,\" 1956; vol. 2 1980). It argues that a gap has developed between humanity's technologically enhanced capacity to create and destroy, and our ability to imagine that destruction. Anders devoted a great deal of attention to the nuclear threat, making him an early critic of this technology as well.\n\nThe two volume work is made up of a string of philosophical essays that start with an observation often found in Anders' diary entries dating back to his exile in the U.S. in the 1940s.\n\nTo provide an example from the first chapter of volume one: \"First Encounter with Promethean Shame – Today's Prometheus asks: 'Who am I anyway?'\"; \n11 March 1942.\n\"Shame about the 'embarrassingly' high quality of manufactured goods.\" What are we embarrassed about? Anders' answer to this question is simply \"that we were born and not manufactured.\"\n\nJust as Arendt in her \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" elucidated the Banality of Evil by declaring that horrendous crimes can be committed by quite ordinary people, Anders explores the moral and ethical ramifications of the facts brought to light in the 1960-61 trial of Adolf Eichmann in \"We Sons of Eichmann: Open Letter to Klaus Eichmann\" (the son of the noted Nazi bureaucrat and genocidaire). He suggests that the appellation \"Eichmann\" properly designates any person who actively participated in, ignored or failed to learn about, or even knew about but took no action against the Nazis' mass murder campaigns against Jews and others. He explained to his audience in Austria and Germany, among them young writers searching for ways to empathize with their parents' generation, that \"there was but one viable alternative not only for Eichmann's son Klaus but all 'Eichmann sons,' namely to repudiate their fathers since mourning them was not an option.\"\n\nForeword. \"Outdatedness of Human Beings 1\", 5th edition \n\"The three main theses: that we are no match for the perfection of our products; that we produce more than we can visualize and take responsibility for; and that we believe, that, what we can do, are allowed to do, no: should do, no: must do – these three basic theses, in light of the environmental threats emerging over the last quarter century, have become more prevailing and urgent than they were then.\"\n\nChanging the world\n\"It does not suffice to change the world. We do that anyway. And to a large extent that happens even without our involvement. In addition we have to interpret this change. Precisely because to change it. That therefore the world does not change without us. And ultimately into a world without us.\"\n\nIntroduction. \"Outdatedness of Human Beings 2\"\nThis volume is \"...a philosophical anthropology in the age of technocracy\". With \"technocracy\" I do not mean the rule of technocrats (as if they were a group of specialists, who dominate today's politics), but the fact, that the world, in which we live and which determines us, is a technological one – which extends so far, that \"we are not allowed to say, that in our historical situation there is among other things technology, rather do we have to say: within the world's status called \"technology\" history happens, in other words technology has become the subject of history\", in which we are only \"co-historical\".\n\nDedication. \"Outdatedness of Human Beings 1\", 5th edition\n\nExactly half a century ago, in nineteen hundred and six, my father William Stern published, then twenty years younger and generations more confident than his son today, the first volume of his work \"Person and Thing.\" His hope, to rehabilitate the \"Person\" through his struggle against an impersonal Psychology, he only unwillingly would have seen dashed. His very own kindness and the optimism of the times, to which he belonged, prevented him for many years, to understand that what makes a \"Person\" a \"Thing\", is not its scientific treatment; but the actual treatment of one human being by another. When overnight he was dishonored and chased away by the spurners of humanity, he was not spared the grief that comes from a better understanding into a world worse off.\n\nIn memory of him, who indelibly implanted the idea of human dignity in his son, these mournful pages on the devastation of human beings were written.\n\nLove Yesterday. Notes on the History of Feelings. 1986.\nWithout knights no chivalry, without court no courtliness, without salon no charm, without material support no deference will last indefinitely, not even as make-believe. In the same manner what shrinks in a world that cheats us out of leisure and other preconditions of our privacy, are the subtleties of our emotional private lives.\n\nJewish Origins. In: Paul van Dijk, Anthropology in the Age of Technology.\n\"His Jewish self-consciousness reveals itself in the acknowledgment that he is never more ashamed than when meeting a Jew who is ashamed to be a Jew. The Judaism that Anders represents with the fierceness and decisiveness that is so characteristic of him is, however, a modern, secular, and humanistic Judaism.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The \"Heurige\" are renowned for their atmosphere of \"Gemütlichkeit\" shared among a throng enjoying young wine, simple food, and - in some places - Schrammelmusik. They correspond to the Straußwirtschaften in the German Rheinland, the \"Frasche\" in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and \"Osmiza\" in Slovenia.\n\n\"Heuriger\" is the abbreviation of \"heuriger Wein\" (this year's wine) in Austrian and Bavarian German. Originally, they were simple open-air taverns on the premises of winemakers, where people would bring along food and drink the new wine. Nowadays, the taverns are often situated at a distance from the wineyards and offer both food and drinks. \"Heurige\" where apple or pear cider is served are called a \"Mostheurige\". In the well-known wine-growing areas of the city of Vienna (Grinzing, Sievering, Neustift, Liesing) many eating establishments have a rustic interior design similar to \"Heurige\", yet they have a normal licence and sell wine they buy from outside sources.\n\nOn 17 August 1784 Austrian Emperor Joseph II issued a decree that permitted all residents to open establishments to sell and serve self-produced \"wine and juices.\" At first no food could be sold in order to prevent competition with restaurants, but over time these restrictions lessened. \n\nOver the years well-known areas for \"Heurigen\" developed, including Grinzing, Sievering, Neustift am Walde, Perchtoldsdorf, Mauer, Stammersdorf, Guntramsdorf, Gumpoldskirchen, Traiskirchen, Gainfarn, Dürnstein, Langenlois, the Wachau region, Rust, Königstetten, Gamlitz, and Kitzeck.\n\nSimilar establishments exist in wine-producing regions elsewhere in Austria, known as \"Buschenschank\" in Styria, and \"Straußen\", \"Besenwirtschaft\", or \"Heckenwirtschaft\" in Germany and other German-speaking areas.\n\nA \"Heuriger\" is prized both for the charms of what it offers and its limitations. Each \"Heuriger\" is only open briefly, usually 2 or 3 weeks during a four month season in the Fall, although it may reopen again later in the season when more wine has been produced. It serves only its own wine, and but a limited selection of food as an evening meal, generally local, homemade products offered as small dishes such as Liptauer spread, various meat or sausage and Semmel combinations, or cheese boards.\n\nTypical drinks found at \"Heurigen\" include Sturm, a partially fermented wine sold at the beginning of fall that still contains a fair amount of grape, and Gruner Veltliner, which is one of the most popular types of Austrian wine. Almdudler and Gespritzer are also commonly found at modern \"Heurigen.\" Lucky patrons will sometimes find Eiswein to enjoy with dessert. \n\n\"Heurigen\" indicate that they are open and guests welcome by displaying a handful of conifer or fir twigs bound in a circlar \"Buschen\" hung above the entrance door. Until the 20th century, it was customary for guests to bring along their own food when enjoying wine at a \"Heuriger\". To make an establishment more profitable, in many places the tavern was leased to other winemakers (\"Winzer\" in German), known as \"Winzerstuben\".\n\n\"Gemütlichkeit\" shared among a throng enjoying young wine, simple food, and traditional music is one of the greatest appeals of a \"Heuriger\". As a result, many establishments elsewhere, such as in Vienna, are made to look like \"Heurigen\" but in fact are licensed restaurants selling wines from outside sources; these even serve beer and coffee, unthinkable at an authentic \"Heuriger\".\n\nMusic has traditionally been part of the \"Heuriger\" ambiance and contributes greatly to its \"Gemütlichkeit\". When present today it is typically provided by a pair of \"Heurigensänger\" who serenade from table to table for tips. Playing a guitar and accordion, they take requests for songs from their repertoire of \"Wienerlieder\" and Schrammelmusik.\n\nThese songs' themes invariably revolve around the quality of the wine, its consumption and consequences, Vienna's beauty, a nostalgic longing for the past, the transience of life, the inevitability of suffering and death at God's will, and, to a somewhat lesser degree, romantic love.\n\nEven trying to honor the \"Heuriger\" tradition, music has changed dramatically since performers such as The Third Man sensation Anton Karas earned a living by playing his zither or Hans Moser sang a \"Wienerlied\" from his movies. Visitors from Germany will hope to hear songs from their native land, as will those from others; the \"Heurigensänger\" will try their best.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29988031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29988031", "title": "Ideal managerial climate", "text": "Ideal managerial climate\n\nIdeal managerial climate (IMC) is a concept within organizational communication. Introduced by W. Charles Redding in 1972, this theoretical concept serves as a comprehensive model for management, and organizations as a whole, that places emphasis on relationships, interactions, and leadership functions. IMC furthers discussion in organizational communication beyond formal relations and structures, and assesses those characteristics that can produce the most ideal environment in an organization, and/or its management. This model presents an ideal situation rather than an attainable one, and should be a used as a tool for comparison, self-assessment, and improvement for organizations.\n\nW. Charles Redding, commonly credited as the father of organizational communication, conducted significant research that made substantial contributions to organizational and managerial communication. Redding was one of the first to investigate the climates of organizations. His quantitative studies examined communicative dynamics among the members of organizations across various structures. Prior to Redding’s contributions, research pertaining to organizational climate was limited specifically to the analysis of events or isolated messages rather than the larger dynamics of the organization. Based on his findings, Redding developed a prescriptive model for managers known as the \"ideal managerial climate\", which connects leadership functions to the organizational communication climate. Redding claimed that any experience in an organizational setting is a message, including both nonverbal and verbal communication. Message and message-related practices are the basic premise by which organizational environments and climates are created. Climate can be defined as “the psychological environment in which organizational behavior occurs.” As this applies to organizational communication, “organizational climate” can be defined as the relationships and interactions that contribute to the formation of workplace environments among and across various organizational structures. Redding states that “the communication ‘climate’ of the organization is more crucial than are communication skills or techniques (taken by themselves) in creating an effective organization.” When evaluating organizational climate using IMC, the ideal productive environment of an organizational is related to the culture and values an organization possesses.\n\nBased on Redding’s research and consultation experience, he found five dynamics to be key in the attempt to produce a stable, satisfying, and content atmosphere in the workplace. These characteristics were reflective on organizational productivity, preventing workplace conflicts, and positive influence and fluency in organizational structure.\n\n1. Trust: Trust, confidence, and credibility should be maintained in the relationships between members of the organization at all levels of the hierarchy.\n\n2. Supportiveness: Personnel should feel free to speak what is on their minds in an atmosphere of acceptance, regardless of their positioning as superior or subordinate.\n\n3. Openness: The dynamics in an organizational setting should be clear and free of confusion. However, although there may be formal hierarchical structures, communication should be not limited by rigid boundaries.\n\n4. Emphasis on high-performance goals: All members of an organization should be committed to high-performance goals such as high productivity, high quality, low cost, and a concern for other members.\n\n5. Participative decision-making: Employees at all levels in the organization should be communicated to and consulted with in decision-making and goal-setting relevant to their positions.\n\n6.Emotional connections: If employees feel an emotional connection to the work that is facilitated through the manager, work will be done more effectively and the employees will be able to be more productive.\n\nIn 1976, Peterson and Pace expanded on the IMC model with the development of the communication climate inventory (CCI). Similar to Redding’s, this model was designed to analyze the communication dynamics of an organizational setting according to six categories of “communication effects.” Peterson and Pace used the five components of IMC as a foundational premise upon which to base their model.\n"}

His works as a scholar of Sikhism include, \"Ardaas: Darshan Roop Te Abhiyas\", \"Sada Vigas\", \"Achetan di Leela\", \"Divine Intimations\", \"Prophet of Devotion\" and \"Pilgrimage to Hemkunt\".\n\nHe was born in the village of Murid, District of Jhelum (in present-day Pakistan). His father was S. Hari Gulab Singh and his mother was Smt. Sita Wanti. When he was still an infant, his parents moved to Quetta in (Baluchistan) in present-day Pakistan.\n\nIt was in Quetta that he joined Khalsa High School whence he matriculated in 1941 securing the highest marks in Baluchistan and setting up a new record. He joined the Forman Christian College, Lahore, for his premedical studies.\n\nThere he enjoyed two merit scholarships – one granted by the University and the other by the college. In his FSc (Medical) exam, he stood second in the university. For his graduate course in medicine and surgery, he joined King Edward Medical College, Lahore, where he also received a merit scholarship granted by the Government of Baluchistan.\n\nIn 1947 when the country was partitioned, he left Lahore and joined Government Medical College, Amritsar, where he completed his medical studies to graduate in 1949.

He developed a distinctive philosophical approach which he called transcendental pragmatics (\"Transzendentalpragmatik\").\n\nApel grew up during the political crises of the Weimar Republic. In 1940, he was a war volunteer with his entire graduating class. After the Second World War, Apel studied from 1945 to 1950 at the University of Bonn, first history and intellectual history, before he committed himself as a student of Erich Rothacker on philosophy. In 1950, he received his doctorate from Bonn with a thesis on Martin Heidegger.\n\nApel was appointed lecturer at the University of Mainz in 1961. He was a full professor of philosophy at the University of Kiel from 1962 to 1969, at the University of Saarbrücken from 1969 to 1972, and at the University of Frankfurt am Main from 1972 to 1990. In 1990, he transferred to emeritus status. He has held a number of visiting and guest professorships at universities around the world.\n\nHe was made a Member of the Academia Europaea in 1989 and a Full Member of the Academia Scientiarum et Artium Europaea in 1993. In 2001, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nApel worked in ethics, the philosophy of language and human sciences. He wrote extensively in these fields, publishing mostly in German. Apel's work brings together the Analytical and Continental philosophical traditions, especially pragmatism and the critical theory of the Frankfurt School.\n\nIn \"Understanding and Explanation: A Transcendental-Pragmatic Perspective\", Apel reformulated the difference between understanding (\"Verstehen\") and explanation (\"Erklärung\"), which originated in the hermeneutics of Wilhelm Dilthey and interpretive sociology of Max Weber, on the basis of a Peircean-inspired transcendental-pragmatic account of language. This account of the \"lifeworld\" would become an element of the theory of communicative action and discourse ethics, which Apel co-developed with Jürgen Habermas. Strategic rationality both claim to stand in need of communicative rationality that is seen as, in several regards, more fundamental. While sympathetic to Habermas's \"Theory of Communicative Action\", Apel has been critical of aspects of Habermas's approach. Apel has proposed that a theory of communication should be grounded in the transcendental-pragmatic conditions of communication. After taking his point of departure from Apel, Habermas has moved towards a \"weak transcendentalism\" that is more closely tied to empirical social inquiry.\n\nApel also wrote works on Charles Sanders Peirce and is a past president of the C. S. Peirce Society.\n\nAn early German-speaking adversary of so-called critical rationalism, Apel published a critique of the philosophy of Karl Popper: In \"Transformation der Philosophie\" (1973), Apel charged Popper with being guilty of, amongst other things, a pragmatic contradiction.\n\nFrom the 1970s to the 1990s, Apel influenced other philosophers writing in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Apel died on 15 May 2017 at the age of 95.\n\n\n"}

(See Timor–Flores languages and Timor–Alor–Pantar languages.) The lingua franca and national language of East Timor is Tetum, an Austronesian language influenced by Portuguese, with which it has equal status as an official language. The language of the Ocussi exclave is Uab Meto (Dawan). Fataluku is a Papuan language widely used in the eastern part of the country (often more so than Tetum). Both Portuguese and Tetum have official recognition under the Constitution of East Timor, as do other indigenous languages, including: Bekais, Bunak, Galoli, Habun, Idalaka, Kawaimina, Kemak, Lovaia, Makalero, Makasae, Mambai, Tokodede and Wetarese.\n\nThe rise of lingua francas in the linguistically diverse East Timor and the domination of several clans over others have led to the extinction of many smaller languages. However, some of them are still in use as ritual languages or cants. Research done in the mid-2000s by the Dutch linguist Aone van Engelenhoven, for example, revealed that the Makuva language, formerly spoken by the Makuva tribe but believed to have been extinct since the 1950s, was still used occasionally.\n\nIn 2007, Van Engelenhoven discovered the existence of another language that was essentially extinct, called Rusenu.\n\nSection 13(1) of the 2002 constitution designates Portuguese and Tetum as East Timor's two official languages. The same section also provides that \"Tetum and the other national languages shall be valued and developed by the State.\" English and Indonesian are sometimes used and section 159 of the constitution provides that these languages serve as \"working languages within civil service side by side with official languages as long as deemed necessary\".\n\nUnder Portuguese rule, all education was through the medium of Portuguese, although it coexisted with Tetum and other languages. Portuguese particularly influenced the dialect of Tetum spoken in the capital, Dili, known as \"Tetun Prasa\", as opposed to the more traditional version spoken in rural areas, known as \"Tetun Terik\". \"Tetun Prasa\" is the version more widely used, and is now taught in schools.\n\nUnder Indonesian rule, Indonesian was the official language. Along with English, it has the status of a 'working language' under the Constitution.\n\nFor many older East Timorese, the Indonesian language has negative connotations with the Suharto regime, but many younger people expressed suspicion or hostility to the reinstatement of Portuguese, which they saw as a 'colonial language' in much the same way that Indonesians saw Dutch and how the Filipinos saw Spanish and, increasingly, English. However, whereas the Dutch culture and language had limited influence on those of Indonesia, the East Timorese and Portuguese cultures became intertwined, particularly through intermarriage, as did the languages. Portuguese was also a working language of the resistance against Indonesia.\n\nSome young East Timorese felt at a disadvantage by the adoption of Portuguese as an official language, and accused the country's leaders of favouring the older generations who speak Portuguese and educated Timorese who had only recently returned from overseas, arguing that those older East Timorese who speak Portuguese or English had more job opportunities. \nMany foreign observers, especially from Australia and Southeast Asia were also critical about the reinstatement of Portuguese, arguing that English or Indonesian would have been preferable. In spite of this, many Australian linguists have been closely involved with the official language policy, including the promotion of Portuguese.\n\nPortugal and other Portuguese language countries such as Brazil have supported the teaching of Portuguese in East Timor. Some people in East Timor complained that teachers from Portugal and Brazil were poorly equipped to teach in the country, as they did not know local languages, or understand the local culture. \nNevertheless, the late Sérgio Vieira de Mello, who headed the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, was a Brazilian who established a close working relationship with Xanana Gusmão, the country's first president, as a fellow Portuguese-speaker but was respected by many East Timorese because of his efforts to learn Tetum.\n\nLanguages of East Timor by number of speakers\n\n"}

The goal of the festival is to boost interest in Europe's minority languages, especially with young people.\n\nLiet International began in 2002 as a spinoff of the Frisian-language song contest Liet (West Frisian for \"song\"), held annually in Leeuwarden/Ljouwert since 1991. The first three editions of Liet International likewise took place in Leeuwarden. Since 2006 it has been held in a different city each year. The 2006 and 2008 contests, held in the Swedish Sápmi, were titled Liet-Lávlut (\"lávlut\" is Northern Sami for \"sing\"). \n\nSince 2008 Liet International has been organized under the patronage of the Council of Europe.\n\nContests were cancelled in 2007 and 2013 when the hosting organizations, in Narbonne and Corsica respectively, backed out at a late stage. No Liet International was held in 2015.\n\nThe winners of certain song contests for particular languages or groups of languages automatically qualify as entrants for Liet International. These contests thus function as selection rounds for the international contest. They have included:\n\n\nAdditional entrants are chosen from applying artists by a selection committee.\n\nThe first Liet International song contest was held on April 28, 2002 at the theatre in Leeuwarden/Ljouwert, Friesland, the Netherlands. The West Frisian-language Liet contest was held on the previous night, and in a pattern that would be repeated in future editions the winner of Liet went on to represent Friesland in the international contest. However in later years Liet International would be held some months after Liet.\n\nBoth the jury and public awards were won by the Catalan band Pomada for their song \"En Pere Galleri\".\n\nThe second Liet International contest was again held at the De Harmonie theatre in Leeuwarden, on November 23, 2003.\n\nTransjoik, a Sámi group from Norway, won the jury award with their song \"Mijjajaa\". The public award was won by Welsh/Cornish singer Gwenno for her song in Cornish, \"Vodya\".\n\nThe third edition of the contest was held on the 22nd of October, 2004. The venue was once again the De Harmonie theatre in Leeuwarden. Sámi singer Niko Valkeapää won both the jury and the public award with his song \"Rabas mielain\". This was the second time in a row that the contest was won by the Sámi entry.\n\nSince the Sámi had won two out of the three competitions, the festival was held in Östersund, Sweden, which is the southern reaches of the area, Sápmi, that the Sámi live in the Nordic Countries. Sixty competitors, singing in 25 minority languages, took part in the preliminary elimination round. Eleven songs, representing 11 languages, were selected for the final competition.\n\nAlthough the winner was selected by the festival's jury, the audience could vote for their favorite artist at the festival, on the Internet and by SMS message. The Sámi duo of Johan Kitti from Sweden and Ellen Sara Bæhr from Norway won the competition with \"Luđiin muitalan\", sung in Northern Sámi. The audience favorite was Liza Pannetier, with her song in Occitan, \"Soleu Rouge\".\n\nThe competition took place on 18 October at Kulturens hus in Luleå/Luleju, Sweden. Corsican singer Jacques Culioli won both the jury's and public's awards.\n\nIn January the Board of the Liet Foundation decided to continue under the name Liet International. \nThe 6th competition was held on 31 October 2009, returning to the De Harmonie theater in Leeuwarden. \n\nThe Finnish Sámi rock band Somby won the competition with their song \"Ii iđit vel\", sung in Northern Sámi. The audience favorite was Dr. Drer en Cre Posse from Sardinia, with their song \"Apu biu\".\n\nIn 2010 Liet International was held in the Breton city of Lorient/An Oriant in France. The contest was won by the band Orka of the Faroe Islands with their song \"Rúmdardrongurin\". The public award went to the Friulian band R.esistence in Dub and their song \"Fieste\".\n\nThe eighth Liet International was held on November 19, 2011 at the Teatro Giovanni da Udine in Udine/Udin, the historical capital of the Italian region of Friûl.\n\nThe Frisian singer Janna Eijer (22) from Jobbegea won the jury prize with her song \"Ien klap\", while the band Coffeeshock Company from Austria won the public vote with \"Gusla mi se je znicila\", sung in Burgenland Croatian.\n\nThe ninth edition of Liet International was held in Gijón/Xixón, Asturias, Spain, at the Teatru de la Llaboral, on December 1, 2012. Welsh-born Breton singer Lleuwen won the jury prize for her song \"Ar Gouloù Bev\", while the public prize went to Asturiana Mining Company with \"Si nun conoces Vaḷḷouta\".\n\nThe 2014 contest was held in Oldenburg, Germany. 19-year-old musician Martina Iori, from Val di Fassa in the north of Italy, won the jury award for her song \"Via con mia mùsega\", sung in Ladin. \n\nIn this year the audience award was replaced by a musicians' award voted on by the contestants themselves. This was won by Aila-Duo from Finland and their song in Aanaar Sámi \"Naharij kandâ\".\n\nThe 11th Liet International song contest was scheduled to be held in late 2016 in Kautokeino/Guovdageaidnu, Norway, the home of the Sámi Grand Prix. However, due to a lack of funds the contest was rescheduled to fall on April 13 2017, as part of the Sámi Easterfestival.\n\nFor a second time in the history of the contest, a local singer, Norwegian Sami-speaker Ella Marie Hætta Isaksen, won the contest with her song \"Luoddaearru” (“Crossroad”) in addition to being awarded the Musicians' award.\n\nThe 12th Liet International song contest was held on May 23 2018 at Neushoorn Leeuwarden as part of LF2018 (Leeuwarden's stint as European Capital of Culture).\n\n"}

Phyla with historically wide geographical distributions but comparatively few current-day speakers include Eskimo–Aleut, Na-Dené, Algic, Quechuan and Nilo-Saharan. \n\nThe geographic headings over them are meant solely as a tool for grouping families into collections, more comprehensible than an unstructured list of a few hundred independent families. Geographic relationship is convenient for that purpose, but these headings are \"not\" a suggestion of any \"super-families\" phylogenetically relating the families named. \n\nThe number of individual languages in a family and the number of their speakers are only rough estimates: see dialect or language and linguistic demography for further explanation.\n\nLanguage isolates are languages which are not part of any known family and they can be alternatively described as being its sole representants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages are considered unclassified either because, for one reason or another, little effort has been made to compare them with other languages or more commonly, because they are too poorly documented to permit reliable classification: most such languages are extinct and, most likely, will never be known well enough to classify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section lists extinct languages and families which have no known living relatives; while a minority of these is well known but is still classified as genetically independent (like the ancient Sumerian language), the lack of attestation makes many of these hard to put into larger groups.\n\nThe classification of languages into families, assumes that all of them develop from a single parent proto-language and evolve over time into different daughter language(s). While the vast majority of tongues fit this description fairly well, there are exceptions.\nA mixed language often refers to a particular combination of existing ones, which may stem from different families: a pidgin is a simple language used for communication between groups; this may involve simplification and/or mixing of multiple languages. When a pidgin develops into a more stable language which children learn from birth, it is usually called a \"creole\".\nWhether for ease of use or created for use in fiction, languages can also be constructed from the ground up, rather than develop from existing ones; these are known as constructed languages.\n\nThe family relationships of sign languages are not well established due to a lagging in linguistic research, and many are (cf.

{"id": "1932759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1932759", "title": "Making out", "text": "Making out\n\nMaking out is a term of American origin, dating back to at least 1949, and is used variously to refer to \"kissing\", \"petting\", and \"necking\", but may also refer to non-penetrative sex acts such as heavy petting. Snogging has roughly the same meaning in British English and in some related varieties of English, except in Hiberno-English (spoken in Ireland), where it is more commonly known as shifting.\n\nThe sexual connotations of the phrase \"make out\" appear to have developed in the 1930s and 1940s from the phrase's other meanings of \"to succeed\". Originally, it meant \"to seduce\" or \"to have sexual intercourse with\". When performed in a car, it may be euphemistically referred to as \"parking\".\n\nStudies indicate that at the beginning of the 20th century, premarital sex increased, and with it, petting behavior in the 1920s. The Continental experience at that time is amusingly illustrated by a letter that Sigmund Freud wrote to Sándor Ferenczi in 1931 playfully admonishing him to stop kissing his patients, in which Freud warned lest \"a number of independent thinkers in matters of technique will say to themselves: Why stop at a kiss? Certainly one gets further when one adopts 'pawing' as well, which, after all, doesn't make a baby. And then bolder ones will come along who will go further, to peeping and showing – and soon we shall have accepted in the technique of analysis the whole repertoire of \"demi-viergerie\" and petting parties\".\n\nBy the postwar period, necking and petting became accepted behavior in mainstream American culture, as long as the partners were dating.\n\nMaking out is usually considered an expression of affection or sexual attraction. An episode of making out is frequently referred to as a \"make-out session\" or simply \"making out,\" depending on the speaker's vernacular. It covers a wide range of sexual behavior, and means different things to different age groups in different parts of the United States. It typically refers to kissing, including prolonged, passionate, open-mouth kissing (also known as French kissing), and intimate skin-to-skin contact. The term can also refer to other forms of foreplay such as heavy petting, which typically involves some genital stimulation, but usually not the direct act of penetrative sexual intercourse.\n\nThe perceived significance of making out may be affected by the age and relative sexual experience of the participants. Teenagers sometimes play party games in which making out is the main activity as an act of exploration. Games in this category include seven minutes in heaven and spin the bottle.\n\nTeenagers may have had social gatherings in which making out was the predominant event. In the United States, these events were referred to as \"make-out parties\" and would sometimes be confined to a specific area, called the \"make-out room\". These make-out parties were generally not regarded as sex parties, though heavy petting may have been involved, depending on the group.\n\n"}

{"id": "898044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=898044", "title": "Medieval Latin", "text": "Medieval Latin\n\nMedieval Latin was the form of Latin used in Roman Catholic Western Europe during the Middle Ages. In this region it served as the primary written language, though local languages were also written to varying degrees. Latin functioned as the main medium of scholarly exchange, as the liturgical language of the Church, and as the working language of science, literature, law, and administration.\n\nMedieval Latin represented, in essence, an attempt to continue Classical Latin and Late Latin, with enhancements for new concepts as well as for the increasing integration of Christianity. Despite some meaningful differences from Classical Latin, Medieval writers did not regard it as a fundamentally different language. There is no real consensus on the exact boundary where Late Latin ends and Medieval Latin begins. Some scholarly surveys begin with the rise of early Ecclesiastical Latin in the middle of the 4th century, others around 500, and still others with the replacement of written Late Latin by written Romance languages starting around the year 900.\n\nThe terms \"Medieval Latin\" and \"Ecclesiastical Latin\" are often used synonymously, though some scholars draw distinctions. \"Ecclesiastical Latin\" refers specifically to the form that has been used by the Roman Catholic Church, whereas \"Medieval Latin\" refers more broadly to all of the (written) forms of Latin used in the Middle Ages. The Romance languages spoken in the Middle Ages were often referred to as \"Latin\", since the Romance languages were all descended from Classical, or Roman, Latin itself.\n\nMedieval Latin had an enlarged vocabulary, which freely borrowed from other sources. It was heavily influenced by the language of the Vulgate, which contained many peculiarities alien to Classical Latin that resulted from a more or less direct translation from Greek and Hebrew; the peculiarities mirrored the original not only in its vocabulary but also in its grammar and syntax. Greek provided much of the technical vocabulary of Christianity. The various Germanic languages spoken by the Germanic tribes, who invaded southern Europe, were also major sources of new words. Germanic leaders became the rulers of parts of the Roman Empire that they conquered, and words from their languages were freely imported into the vocabulary of law. Other more ordinary words were replaced by coinages from Vulgar Latin or Germanic sources because the classical words had fallen into disuse.\n\nLatin was also spread to areas such as Ireland and Germany, where Romance languages were not spoken, and which had never known Roman rule. Works written in those lands where Latin was a learned language, having no relation to the local vernacular, also influenced the vocabulary and syntax of medieval Latin.\n\nSince subjects like science and philosophy, including Argumentation theory and Ethics (pre-law), were communicated in Latin, the Latin vocabulary that developed for them became the source of a great many technical words in modern languages. English words like \"abstract\", \"subject\", \"communicate\", \"matter\", \"probable\" and their cognates in other European languages generally have the meanings given to them in medieval Latin.\n\nThe influence of Vulgar Latin was also apparent in the syntax of some medieval Latin writers, although Classical Latin continued to be held in high esteem and studied as models for literary compositions. The high point of the development of medieval Latin as a literary language came with the Carolingian renaissance, a rebirth of learning kindled under the patronage of Charlemagne, king of the Franks. Alcuin was Charlemagne's Latin secretary and an important writer in his own right; his influence led to a rebirth of Latin literature and learning after the depressed period following the final disintegration of the authority of the Western Roman Empire.\n\nAlthough it was simultaneously developing into the Romance languages, Latin itself remained very conservative, as it was no longer a native language and there were many ancient and medieval grammar books to give one standard form. On the other hand, strictly speaking there was no single form of \"medieval Latin\". Every Latin author in the medieval period spoke Latin as a second language, with varying degrees of fluency and syntax. Grammar and vocabulary, however, were often influenced by an author's native language. This was especially true beginning around the 12th century, after which the language became increasingly adulterated: late medieval Latin documents written by French speakers tend to show similarities to medieval French grammar and vocabulary; those written by Germans tend to show similarities to German, etc. For instance, rather than following the classical Latin practice of generally placing the verb at the end, medieval writers would often follow the conventions of their own native language instead. Whereas Latin had no definite or indefinite articles, medieval writers sometimes used forms of \"unus\" as an indefinite article, and forms of \"ille\" (reflecting usage in the Romance languages) as a definite article or even \"quidam\" (meaning \"a certain one/thing\" in Classical Latin) as something like an article. Unlike classical Latin, where \"esse\" (\"to be\") was the only auxiliary verb, medieval Latin writers might use \"habere\" (\"to have\") as an auxiliary, similar to constructions in Germanic and Romance languages. The accusative and infinitive construction in classical Latin was often replaced by a subordinate clause introduced by \"quod\" or \"quia\". This is almost identical, for example, to the use of \"que\" in similar constructions in French.\n\nIn every age from the late 8th century onwards, there were learned writers (especially within the Church) who were familiar enough with classical syntax to be aware that these forms and usages were \"wrong\" and resisted their use. Thus the Latin of a theologian like St Thomas Aquinas or of an erudite clerical historian such as William of Tyre tends to avoid most of the characteristics described above, showing its period in vocabulary and spelling alone; the features listed are much more prominent in the language of lawyers (e.g. the 11th century English Domesday Book), physicians, technical writers and secular chroniclers. However the use of \"quod\" to introduce subordinate clauses was especially pervasive and is found at all levels.\n\nMedieval Latin had ceased to be a living language and was instead a scholarly language of the minority of educated men in medieval Europe used in official documents more than for everyday communication. This resulted in two major features of Medieval Latin compared with Classical Latin, though when it is compared to the other vernacular languages, Medieval Latin developed very few changes. First, many authors attempted to \"show off\" their knowledge of Classical Latin by using rare or archaic constructions, sometimes anachronistically (haphazardly mixing constructions from Republican and Imperial Latin, which in reality existed centuries apart). Second, many lesser scholars had a limited grasp of \"proper\" Latin or were increasingly influenced by Vulgar Latin, which was mutating into the Romance languages.\n\n\n\nMany striking differences between classical and medieval Latin are found in orthography. Perhaps the most striking difference is that medieval manuscripts used a wide range of abbreviations by means of superscripts, special characters etc.: for instance the letters \"n\" and \"s\" were often omitted and replaced by a diacritical mark above the preceding or following letter. Apart from this, some of the most frequently occurring differences are as follows. Clearly many of these would have been influenced by the spelling, and indeed pronunciation, of the vernacular language, and thus varied between different European countries.\n\n\nThese orthographical differences were often due to changes in pronunciation or, as in the previous example, morphology, which authors reflected in their writing. By the 16th century, Erasmus complained that speakers from different countries were unable to understand each other's form of Latin.\n\nThe gradual changes in Latin did not escape the notice of contemporaries. Petrarch, writing in the 14th century, complained about this linguistic \"decline\", which helped fuel his general dissatisfaction with his own era.\n\nThe corpus of medieval Latin literature encompasses a wide range of texts, including such diverse works as sermons, hymns, hagiographical texts, travel literature, histories, epics, and lyric poetry.\n\nThe first half of the 5th century saw the literary activities of the great Christian authors Jerome (c. 347–420) and Augustine of Hippo (354–430), whose texts had an enormous influence on theological thought of the Middle Ages, and of the latter's disciple Prosper of Aquitaine (c. 390-455). Of the later 5th century and early 6th century, Sidonius Apollinaris (c. 430 – after 489) and Ennodius (474–521), both from Gaul, are well known for their poems, as is Venantius Fortunatus (c. 530–600). This was also a period of transmission: the Roman patrician Boethius (c. 480–524) translated part of Aristotle's logical corpus, thus preserving it for the Latin West, and wrote the influential literary and philosophical treatise \"De consolatione Philosophiae\"; Cassiodorus (c. 485–585) founded an important library at the monastery of Vivarium near Squillace where many texts from Antiquity were to be preserved. Isidore of Seville (c. 560-636) collected all scientific knowledge still available in his time into what might be called the first encyclopedia, the \"Etymologiae\".\n\nGregory of Tours (c. 538–594) wrote a lengthy history of the Frankish kings. Gregory came from a Gallo-Roman aristocratic family, and his Latin, which shows many aberrations from the classical forms, testifies to the declining significance of classical education in Gaul. At the same time, good knowledge of Latin and even of Greek was being preserved in monastic culture in Ireland and was brought to England and the European mainland by missionaries in the course of the 6th and 7th centuries, such as Columbanus (543–615), who founded the monastery of Bobbio in Northern Italy. Ireland was also the birthplace of a strange poetic style known as Hisperic Latin. Other important Insular authors include the historian Gildas (c. 500–570) and the poet Aldhelm (c. 640–709). Benedict Biscop (c. 628–690) founded the monastery of Wearmouth-Jarrow and furnished it with books which he had taken home from a journey to Rome and which were later used by Bede (c. 672–735) to write his \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\".\n\nMany medieval Latin works have been published in the series Patrologia Latina, Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum and Corpus Christianorum.\n\nMedieval Latin was separated from Classical Latin around 800 AD and at this time was no longer considered part of the everyday language. Spoken Latin became a practice used mostly by the educated high class population. Even then it was not frequently used in casual conversation. An example of these men includes the churchmen who could read Latin, but could not effectively speak it. Latin's use in universities was structured in lectures and debates, however, it was highly recommended that students use it in conversation. This practice was only kept up due to rules.One of Latin's purposes, writing, was still in practice; the main uses being charters for property transactions and to keep track of the pleadings given in court. Even then, those of the church still used Latin more than the rest of the population. At this time, Latin served little purpose to the regular population but was still used regularly in ecclesiastical culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Mill scale is bluish-black in color. It is usually less than thick, and initially adheres to the steel surface and protects it from atmospheric corrosion provided no break occurs in this coating. \n\nBecause it is electrochemically cathodic to steel, any break in the mill scale coating will cause accelerated corrosion of steel exposed at the break. Mill scale is thus a boon for a while until its coating breaks due to handling of the steel product or due to any other mechanical cause. \n\nMill scale becomes a nuisance when the steel is to be processed. Any paint applied over it is wasted, since it will come off with the scale as moisture-laden air gets under it. Thus mill scale can be removed from steel surfaces by flame cleaning, pickling, or abrasive blasting, which are all tedious operations that consume energy. This is why shipbuilders and steel fixers used to leave steel and rebar delivered freshly rolled from mills out in the open to allow it to 'weather' until most of the scale fell off due to atmospheric action. Nowadays, most steel mills can supply their product with mill scale removed and steel coated with shop primers over which welding or painting can be done safely.\n\nMill scale generated in rolling mills will be collected and sent to a sinter plant for recycling.\n\nMill scale is sought after by select abstract expressionist artists as its effect on steel can cause unpredicted and seemingly random abstract organic visual effects. Although the majority of mill scale is removed during its passage through scale breaker rolls during manufacturing, smaller structurally inconsequential residue can be visible. Leveraging this processing vestige by accelerating its corrosive effects through the metallurgical use of phosphoric acid or in conjunction with selenium dioxide can create a high contrast visual substrate onto which other compositional elements can be added. \n\nMill scale can be used as a raw material in granular refractory. When this refractory is cast and preheated, these scales provide escape routes for the evaporating water vapor, thus preventing cracks and resulting in a strong, monolithic structure.\n\n"}

Open education broadens access to the learning and training traditionally offered through formal education systems. The qualifier \"open\" refers to the elimination of barriers that can preclude both opportunities and recognition for participation in institution-based learning. One aspect of openness or \"opening up\" education is the development and adoption of open educational resources.\n\nInstitutional practices that seek to eliminate barriers to entry, for example, would not have academic admission requirements. Such universities include the Open University in Britain, and Athabasca University, Thompson Rivers University, Open Learning in Canada. Such programs are commonly (but not necessarily) distance learning programs like e-learning, MOOC and OpenCourseWare. Whereas many e-learning programs are free to follow, the costs of acquiring a certification may be a barrier. Many open education institutes offer free certification schemes accredited by organisations like UKAS in the UK and ANAB in the United States; others offer a badge.\nEven before the computer was developed, researchers at public universities were working at educating citizens through informal education programs.

The success that the youth had in utilizing \"new\" methods of farming and home economics, caused their parents to adopt the same practices.\n\nAs the 4-H club idea was spreading across the country, Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act. which created the Cooperative Extension Service in the United States Department of Agriculture. The Cooperative Extension Service is a partnership between the USDA, land grant universities in each state, and counties throughout the United States. Through the work of the Cooperative Extension Services and 4-H, people throughout the United States have easy and inexpensive (most often free) access to the latest research done at land-grant universities without having to visit a college campus or attend college courses. The educational programs and resources offered by 4-H and the Cooperative Extension Service meet people where they are, and offer them the opportunity to learn what they want to learn, on their own schedules. In order to meet the changing needs of citizens and the use of new technology, the Cooperative Extension Service has created eXtension, which provides research based, non-biased information on a wide variety of topics to people through the use of the internet.\n\nThe ability to share resources on the web at little cost compared to the distribution of hard copies can facilitate open education. An early example of this is the opencourseware program, established in 2002 by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which was followed by more than 200 universities and organizations. Similar to the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities from the Open Access movement, are the goals and intentions from open education specified in the Cape Town Open Education Declaration. MOOC is a more recent form of online course development getting more attention since the fall of 2011 which was followed by a number of non-certificate-granting programs, including edX, Coursera and Udacity.\n\nOpen education is motivated by a belief that learners want to exercise agency in their studies. Specifically, people engaged in the learning process want to conduct inquiries about potential topics of study, to have a hands-on educational experience instead of a strictly textbook-focused education, to take responsibility for their educational decisions, to experience the emotional and physical side of education, to understand how education and community are related, and to have personal choice in the focus of their classroom studies.\n\nThese learners do a great deal for one another in promoting learning. Learning in a group environment or contributing to a group is beneficial to each learner. Collaborative group work has substantial benefits, such as increased participation by all group members, better understanding and retention of material, mastery of skills, and increased enthusiasm that can spur the participant on to independent learning. The philosophy of an open education centers on student learning and sees the teacher become the learning assistant. Teachers are to observe, guide, and provide materials for the learners. The teachers should facilitate, not dominate, the learning process. Open education is optimistic in the belief that the freedom of choice and student direction will promote a better quality of learning.\n\nThe basis for the learning philosophies of open education can be traced back to the work of educational reformer John Dewey and developmental psychologist Jean Piaget.\n\nAvailable technologies for open education are important in the overall efficiency of the program. After available technologies have been found, there need to be appropriate applications on the technologies for the specific online education program.\n\nSince open education usually occurs at a different time and different place for most individuals across the world, certain technologies need to be utilized to enhance the program. These technologies are primarily online and serve a variety of purposes. Websites and other computer-based training may be used to provide lecture notes, assessments, and other course materials. Videos are provided and feature speakers, class events, topic discussions, and faculty interviews. YouTube and iTunesU are often used for this purpose. Students may interact through computer conferencing with Skype or Google+, e-mail, online study groups, or annotations on social bookmarking sites. Other course content may be provided through tapes, print, and CDs.\n\nGovernments, institutions, and people realize the importance of education. Human knowledge is crucial to producing competent leaders, innovators, and teachers. Educational systems must provide each individual the chance in building a better life. Technology has made the expansion of educational opportunities easier. Through the Internet, students can easily find information practically on any topic while mentors are capable of sharing their expertise with any student within seconds. Educational materials are disseminated to a global audience without additional costs. Evolving technology makes it possible for learners to interact with the global community in the comfort of their homes. Under distance learning, universities and colleges expand their impact through online courses that people in any country can take.\n\nOpen education includes resources such as practices and tools that are not hampered by financial, technical, and legal impediments. These resources are used and shared easily within the digital settings. Technology revolutionized techniques in sending receiving information on a daily basis particularly in education. Availability of web resources has transformed everything. Open education is founded on Open Educational Resources (OER) comprised or learning, teaching, and research sources. With Open Education, the costs of textbooks which surged over three times the rate of inflation for many years must not hinder education. Based on the NBC News review of the Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics data, prices of student books increased three times inflation rates from January 1977 until June 2015 reflecting an increase of 1,041 percent. \n\nOER can possibly address this problem since materials are free online and economical in printed form. Resources intended for buying textbooks can be rechanneled towards technology, enhancing the medium of instructions, and lowering debt. Research studies also showed many students learn more because of their access to quality materials. Technology also has unlimited potentials in raising teaching and learning to a higher level. \n\nThere are a number of concerns regarding the implementation of open education systems, specifically for use in developing countries. These include a potential lack of administrative oversight and quality assurance systems for educators/materials in some programs, infrastructure limitations in developing countries, a lack of equal access to technologies required for students' full participation in online education initiatives, and questions regarding the use of copyrighted materials.\n"}

This has been controversial, and in 2006 the NYSE Proxy Working Group recommended that the rules be modified so that uncontested director elections were not considered routine. The SEC approved the rule on July 1, 2009.\n\nIn July 2010, the SEC announced that it was seeking public comment on the efficiency of the proxy system.\n\nThere has been some controversy over \"proxy access\" which is a method to allow shareholders to nominate candidates which appear on the proxy statement. Currently, only the nominating board can place candidates on the proxy statement. The United States Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act specifically allowed the SEC to rule on this issue. In 2010, the SEC passed a rule which allowed certain shareholders to place candidates on the proxy statement; however, the rule was struck down by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2011.\n\n"}

Whoever the author of the text was apparently wished readers to think that it was by Apuleius of Madaura (124–170 CE), the Roman poet and philosopher, but modern scholars do not believe this attribution. Little or nothing else is known of Pseudo-Apuleius apart from this.\n\nThe oldest surviving manuscript of the \"Herbarium\" is the sixth-century Leiden, MS. Voss. Q.9. Until the twelfth century it was the most influential herbal in Europe, with numerous extant copies surviving into the modern era, along with several copies of an Old English translation. Thereafter it was more or less displaced by the \"Circa instans\", a herbal produced at the school of Salerno. \"Pseudo-Apuleius\" is also used as a shorthand generic term to refer to the manuscripts and derived works.\n\nThe text of \"Pseudo-Apuleius herbarius\" is based on late antique sources, especially on \"historia naturalis\" of Pliny and on \"de materia medica\" of Dioscorides. Scholars agree that the herbarius was compiled in the 4th century, according to Sigerist (1930, p. 200) from Latin, according to Singer (1927, p. 37) from Greek sources. Each of the 128 up to 131 chapters of the book (the number varying between manuscripts) dealt with one medical plant. In these chapters the name of the plant was followed by the enumeration of indications in the form of recipes and by synonyms of the plants name.\nFor example: Chapter 89, Herba millefolium (Edition of Howald/Sigerist 1927):\nIn the surviving codices the \"Pseudo-Apuleius Herbarius\" was combined with other treatises: \n\nHowald and Sigerist (edition 1927, V–XVI) divided the codices into 3 classes (α, β and γ) according to the varying mixture of associated texts in the codices: \n\nSinger (1927), Grape-Albers (1977, pp. 2–5) and Collins (2000) cited more manuscripts: \n\nSeveral more manuscripts can be added (see Mylène Pradel-Baquerre 2013 and Claudine \nChavannes-Mazel 2016):\n\nA version of the \"Pseudo-Apuleius Herbarius\" was translated into Old English, surviving now in four manuscripts:\n\n\nLike many of the Latin manuscripts, it includes the \"Herbarium of Pseudo-Apuleius\", \"De herba vetonica\", \"De taxone\", \"medicina de quadrupedibus\", and the \"Liber medicinae ex herbis feminis\". It was first edited and translated by Oswald Cockayne, re-edited in 1984 by Jan de Vriend, and re-translated in 2002 by Anne Van Arsdall. A variety of dates and places have been suggested for the production of this translation, ranging from eighth-century Northumbria to late-tenth-century Winchester, with recent scholarship tending towards tenth-century Wessex.\n\nBased on a 9th-century manuscript of Monte Cassino the first incunable of \"Pseudo-Apuleius Herbarius\" was printed in Rome in 1481.\n\nThe first printing in northern Europe was done 1537 in Zürich.\n\n\n"}

This is because assimilation is the leading cause for the shrinkage of almost all Jewish populations in Western countries since World War II. This shrinkage has been called the \"Silent Holocaust\" (in comparison to the genocide against Jews during World War II) by communal leaders such as Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald of the National Jewish Outreach Program, perhaps the best-known popularizer of the phrase. The Jewish community will not be recognizable in 25 to 30 years. 50% of American Jews marry a non-Jew. Better education is associated with lower levels of intermarriage because Jews with a higher education level encounter a marriage market with more Jews.\n\nTo pro-life activists, the \"silent holocaust\" refers to the estimated 60,000,000 fetuses that have been aborted in the United States since 1973. One activist group, known as the \"Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust,\" feels that everyone has been directly affected by this holocaust because all people have been denied the company of aborted individuals. This group believes it is their job to \"defend the right to life of future generations and end America's genocide.\"\n\nIn 2014, a pro-life politician, Senator Mike Fair, brought this terminology into the political domain, during a debate in the South Carolina State Senate. The debate was over a proposed bill which would ban abortions past 20 weeks. Fair said, \"This Holocaust of our making in our country is 60 million and counting,\" referring to the estimated number abortions performed since \"Roe vs Wade\" legalized abortion in the US. Fair also said Hitler believed \"because you're a Jew you had no right to live. In essence, some people are more qualified to live than others. And that's what we're saying here\", referring to abortion. This sparked an outcry from Senator Joel Lourie, who is Jewish. Lourie said, \"We can debate science and medicine and personhood all day long. But when 6 million people, men, women and children, are dragged into gas chambers, I don’t think that's an appropriate comparison.\" Fair responded with, \"Six million, it shouldn’t have been one, for crying out loud. Six million is incredibly horrible, what they endured. But those 60 million taken out of the womb will never have a chance to be dragged into anything. They’re gone.\" Fair has also compared Planned Parenthood to Hitler.\n\nIn 2013, Jim Bob Duggar, former state legislator and star of the reality television series , compared abortion to the Holocaust at the Values Voters Summit. The comparison sparked criticism, to which Duggar responded, \"Let me clarify, We have since 1973 had 55 million abortions, so what we have going on is a baby holocaust.\" Opposition to this statement prompted a MoveOn.org petition to cancel Duggar's reality television series.\n\n"}

Targets include a wide array of resources that an enemy commander can use to conduct operations including mobile and stationary units, forces, equipment, capabilities, facilities, persons and functions. It may comprise target acquisition, Joint Targeting or Information Operations. \n\nTechnically target acquisition may just denote the process of a weapon system to decide which object to lock on to, as opposed to surveillance on one and target tracking on the other side; for example in an anti-aircraft system.\n\nTarget acquisition under the doctrines of the Cold War and post–Cold War were focused on identifying the capabilities, assets and identities of large troop formations, air defense systems, artillery, rockets, missiles and identifying other High Pay-off Targets (HPTs) and High Value Targets (HVTs). HPTs, which if successfully engaged and neutralized, significantly contribute to the success of the \"friendly commander's\" course of action. HVT is a target that an \"enemy commander\" requires for completion of a mission. They both seem to accomplish the same, but are different when conducting the targeting analysis process.\n\nSince the September 11 attacks, target acquisition has become a highly technical, robust and complex process because of the priority target types, including the targeting of individuals. Whereas a satellite can locate a missile launcher or a formation of 16 tanks by its shape, heat signature or size, it cannot identify and locate 1 of 7 billion individuals without having a person on the ground to recognize, report and engage that individual. This also requires an enhancement of Human Intelligence (HUMINT) sources or the enhancement of biometric technology for the purpose of positive identification of individuals in the targeting process. The Joint Targeting process is better suited for targeting individuals. The latest U.S. doctrine is the JP 3-60, \"Joint Doctrine for Targeting\".\n\n"}
